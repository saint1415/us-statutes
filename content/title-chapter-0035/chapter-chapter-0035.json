Although each district must have a headquarters as set forth in this subsection, the Legislature intends for policies and practices to be implemented to encourage top applicants for judicial vacancies from throughout each entire district and to provide opportunities for remote workplaces for judges and staff who may not live near the headquarters of the district. Further, it is the intent of the Legislature to ensure that the district courts operate as efficiently as possible through the use of leading technologies and by adopting policies and practices that encourage innovation and workforce flexibility.(2)A district court of appeal may designate other locations within its district as branch headquarters for the conduct of the business of the court and as the official headquarters of its officers or employees pursuant to s. 112.061.History.—s. 1, ch. 57-248; s. 1, ch. 65-294; ss. 1, 2, 3, 4, ch. 67-29; s. 8, ch. 71-355; s. 3, ch. 79-413; s. 1, ch. 80-123; s. 22, ch. 2000-237; s. 11, ch. 2008-4; s. 7, ch. 2013-25; s. 9, ch. 2022-163.",
