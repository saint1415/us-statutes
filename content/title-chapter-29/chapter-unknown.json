      "text": "Rules of division.The board shall have the authority to promulgate, amend or repeal rules, according to chapter twenty-nine-a of this code, to implement the provisions of this article:(1) For the preparation, maintenance and revision of a position classification plan for all positions in the classified service and a position classification plan for all positions in the classified-exempt service, based upon similarity of duties performed and responsibilities assumed, so that the same qualifications may reasonably be required for and the same schedule of pay may be equitably applied to all positions in the same class. Except for persons employed by the governing boards of higher education, all persons receiving compensation as a wage or salary, funded either in part or in whole by the state, are included in either the position classification plan for classified service or classified-exempt service. After each such classification plan has been approved by the board, the director shall allocate the position of every employee in the classified service to one of the classes in the classified plan and the position of every employee in the classified-exempt service to one of the positions in the classified-exempt plan. Any employee affected by the allocation of a position to a class shall, after filing with the director of personnel a written request for reconsideration thereof in such manner and form as the director may prescribe, be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard thereon by the director. The interested appointing authority shall be given like opportunity to be heard.(2) For a pay plan for all employees in the classified service, after consultation with appointing authorities and the state fiscal officers, and after a public hearing held by the board. Such pay plan shall become effective only after it has been approved by the Governor after submission to him by the board. Amendments to the pay plan may be made in the same manner. Each employee shall be paid at one of the rates set forth in the pay plan for the class of position in which he is employed. The principle of equal pay for equal work in the several agencies of the state government shall be followed in the pay plan as established hereby.(3) For open competitive examinations to test the relative fitness of applicants for the respective positions in the classified service. Such examinations need not be held until after the rules have been adopted, the service classified and a pay plan established, but shall be held not later than one year after this article takes effect. Such examinations shall be announced publicly at least fifteen days in advance of the date fixed for the filing of applications therefor, and may be advertised through the press, radio and other media. The director may, however, in his or her discretion, continue to receive applications and examine candidates long enough to assure a sufficient number of eligibles to meet the needs of the service and may add the names of successful candidates to existing eligible lists in accordance with their respective ratings.An additional five points shall be awarded to the score of any examination successfully completed by a veteran. A disabled veteran shall be entitled to an additional ten points, rather than five points as aforesaid, upon successful completion of any examination.(4) For promotions within the classified service which shall give appropriate consideration to the applicant's qualifications, record of performance, seniority and his or her score on a written examination, when such examination is practicable. An advancement in rank or grade or an increase in salary beyond the maximum fixed for the class shall constitute a promotion. When any benefit such as a promotion, wage increase or transfer is to be awarded, or when a withdrawal of a benefit such as a reduction in pay, a layoff or job termination is to be made, and a choice is required between two or more employees in the classified service as to who will receive the benefit or have the benefit withdrawn, and if some or all of the eligible employees have substantially equal or similar qualifications, consideration shall be given to the level of seniority of each of the respective employees as a factor in determining which of the employees will receive the benefit or have the benefit withdrawn, as the case may be. When an employee classified in a secretarial or clerical position has, irrespective of job classification, actual job experience related to the qualifications for a managerial or supervisory position, the division shall consider the experience as qualifying experience for the position. The division in its classification plan may, for designated classifications, permit substitution of qualifying experience for specific educational or training requirements at a rate determined by the division.(5) For layoffs by classification for reason of lack of funds or work, or abolition of a position, or material changes in duties or organization, or any loss of position because of the provisions of this subdivision and for recall of employees so laid off, consideration shall be given to an employee's seniority as measured by permanent employment in the classified service or a state agency. In the event that the agency wishes to lay off a more senior employee, the agency must demonstrate that the senior employee cannot perform any other job duties held by less senior employees within that agency in the job class or any other equivalent or lower job class for which the senior employee is qualified: Provided, That if an employee refuses to accept a position in a lower job class, such employee shall retain all rights of recall as hereinafter provided.(6) For recall of employees, recall shall be by reverse order of layoff to any job class that the employee has previously held or a lower class in the series within the agency as that job class becomes vacant. An employee will retain his or her place on the recall list for the same period of time as his or her seniority on the date of his or her layoff or for a period of two years, whichever is less. No new employees shall be hired for any vacancy in his or her job class or in a lower job class in the series until all eligible employees on layoff are given the opportunity to refuse that job class. An employee shall be recalled onto jobs within the county wherein his or her last place of employment is located or within a county contiguous thereto. Any laid-off employee who is eligible for a vacant position shall be notified by certified mail of the vacancy. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to notify the agency of any change in his or her address.Notwithstanding any other provision of the code to the contrary, except for the provisions of section seven, article two, chapter five-b of this code, when filling vacancies at state agencies the directors of state agencies shall, for a period of twelve months after the layoff of a permanent classified employee in another agency, give preference to qualified permanent classified employees based on seniority and fitness over all but existing employees of the agency or its facilities: Provided, That employment of these persons who are qualified and who were permanently employed immediately prior to their layoff shall not supersede the recall rights of employees who have been laid off in such agency or facility.(7) For the establishment of eligible lists for appointment and promotion within the classified service, upon which lists shall be placed the names of successful candidates in the order of their relative excellence in the respective examinations. Eligibility for appointment from any such list shall continue not longer than three years. An appointing authority shall make his selection from the top ten names on the appropriate lists of eligibles, or may choose any person scoring at or above the ninetieth percentile on the examination.For the establishment of eligible lists for preference as provided in subdivision (6) of this section, a list shall be provided according to seniority. An appointed authority shall make the selection of the most senior qualified person: Provided, That eligibility for appointment from any such list shall continue not longer than one year and shall cease immediately upon appointment to a classified position.(8) For the rejection of candidates or eligibles within the classified service who fail to comply with reasonable requirements in regard to such factors as age, physical condition, character, training and experience who are addicted to alcohol or narcotics or who have attempted any deception or fraud in connection with an examination.(9) For a period of probation not to exceed one year before appointment or promotion may be made complete within the classified service.(10) For provisional employment without competitive examination within the classified service when there is no appropriate eligible list available. No such provisional employment may continue longer than six months, nor shall successive provisional appointments be allowed, except during the first year after the effective date of this article, in order to avoid stoppage of orderly conduct of the business of the state.(11) For keeping records of performance of all employees in the classified service, which service records may be considered in determining salary increases and decreases provided in the pay plan; as a factor in promotion tests; as a factor in determining the order of layoffs because of lack of funds or work and in reinstatement; and as a factor in demotions, discharges and transfers.(12) For discharge or reduction in rank or grade only for cause of employees in the classified service. Discharge or reduction of these employees shall take place only after the person to be discharged or reduced has been presented with the reasons for such discharge or reduction stated in writing, and has been allowed a reasonable time to reply thereto in writing, or upon request to appear personally and reply to the appointing authority or his or her deputy: Provided, That upon an involuntary discharge for cause, the employer may require immediate separation from the workplace, or the employee may elect immediate separation. If separation is required by the employer in lieu of any advance notice of discharge, or if immediate separation is elected by an employee who receives notice of an involuntary discharge for cause, the employee is entitled to receive severance pay attributable to time the employee otherwise would have worked, up to a maximum of fifteen calendar days following separation. Receipt of severance pay does not affect any other right to which the employee is entitled with respect to the discharge. The statement of reasons and the reply shall be filed as a public record with the director. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subdivision, no permanent employee shall be discharged from the classified service for absenteeism upon using all entitlement to annual leave and sick leave when such use has been due to illness or injury as verified by a physician's certification or for other extenuating circumstances beyond the employee's control unless his or her disability is of such a nature as to permanently incapacitate him or her from the performance of the duties of his or her position. Upon exhaustion of annual leave and sick leave credits for the reasons specified herein and with certification by a physician that the employee is unable to perform his or her duties, a permanent employee shall be granted a leave of absence without pay for a period not to exceed six months if such employee is not permanently unable to satisfactorily perform the duties of his or her position.(13) For such other rules and administrative regulations, not inconsistent with this article, as may be proper and necessary for its enforcement.(14) The board shall review and approve by rules the establishment of all classified-exempt positions to assure consistent interpretation of the provisions of this article.The provisions of this section are subject to any modifications contained in chapter five-f of this code. The board may include in the rules provided for in this article such provisions as are necessary to conform to regulations and standards of any federal agency governing the receipt and use of federal grants-in-aid by any state agency, anything in this article to the contrary notwithstanding. The board and the director shall see that rules and practices meeting such standards are in effect continuously after the effective date of this article.",

Any such employee shall have the right, upon notice of and prior to the effective date of the reduction in force, to accept a position in a lower job class at no less than the entry salary of that position if the employee: (1) Has formerly performed the duties of that position or the substantial equivalent thereof and is otherwise qualified within the classified service for that position; and (2) is a more senior employee than the least senior employee then employed in such position. No provision of this section shall be construed to deny the right of the appointing authority, in his or her discretion, to reassign, transfer or otherwise retain such employee to or for another position for which the employee is qualified within the classified service. Where the employee is not reassigned, transferred or otherwise retained pursuant to the provisions of this section, no provision of this section shall be construed to deny the employee the opportunity to reapply for entrance in the classified service of the state through participation in competitive examinations.",

A chapter, branch, area, office or similar affiliate or any person soliciting contributions within the state for a charitable organization which has its principal place of business outside the state is a charitable organization for the purposes of this article.(3) “Contribution” means the promise or grant of any money or property of any kind or value.(4) “Financial review” means an examination of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, in which a certified public accountant has a reasonable basis for expressing limited assurance that the reviewed statements are free of material misstatements or false or missing information and are found to be accurate, complete and fairly presented to meet the requirements of the generally accepted accounting principles.(5) “Solicit” and “solicitation” means the request or appeal, directly or indirectly, for any contribution on the plea or representation that the contribution will be used for a charitable purpose, including, without limitation, the following methods of requesting a contribution:(A) Any oral or written request;(B) Any announcement to the press, over the radio or television, or by telephone, electronic mail or messaging, electronic bulletin board, or Internet technology, concerning an appeal or campaign to which the public is requested to make a contribution for any charitable purpose connected therewith;(C) The distribution, circulation, posting or publishing of any handbill, written advertisement or other publication which directly or by implication seeks to obtain public support; or(D) The sale of, offer or attempt to sell, any advertisement, advertising space, subscription, ticket or any service or tangible item in connection with which any appeal is made for any charitable purpose or where the name of any charitable or civic organization is used or referred to in an appeal as an inducement or reason for making the sale, or when or where in connection with the sale, any statement is made that the whole, or any part of, the proceeds from the sale will be donated to any charitable purpose.“Solicitation”, as defined herein, occurs when the request is made, at the place the request is received, whether or not the person making the request actually receives any contribution.(6) “Federated fund-raising organization” means a federation of independent charitable organizations which have voluntarily joined together, including, but not limited to, a united fund or community chest, for purposes of raising and distributing money for and among themselves and where membership does not confer operating authority and control of the individual agencies upon the federated group organization.(7) “Parent organization” is that part of a charitable organization which coordinates, supervises or exercises control over policy, fund raising and expenditures, or assists, receives funds from or advises one or more chapters, branches or affiliates in the state.(8) “Person” means any individual, organization, trust, foundation, group, association, partnership, corporation, society or any combination of them.(9) “Professional fund-raising counsel” means any person who for a flat fixed fee under a written agreement plans, conducts, manages, carries on, advises or acts as a consultant, whether directly or indirectly, in connection with soliciting contributions for, or on behalf of any charitable organization but who actually solicits no contributions as a part of the services. A bona fide salaried officer or employee of a charitable organization maintaining a permanent establishment within the state is not a professional fund-raising counsel.(10) “Professional solicitor” means any person who, for a financial or other consideration, solicits contributions for, or on behalf of a charitable organization, whether the solicitation is performed personally or through that person’s agents, servants or employees specially employed by, or for a charitable organization, who are engaged in the solicitation of contributions under the direction of that person, or a person who plans, conducts, manages, carries on, advises or acts as a consultant to a charitable organization in connection with the solicitation of contributions but does not qualify as “professional fund-raising counsel” within the meaning of this article. A bona fide salaried officer or employee of a charitable organization maintaining a permanent establishment within the state is not a professional solicitor.No attorney, investment counselor or banker, who advises any person to make a contribution to a charitable organization, is considered, as the result of the advice, a professional fund-raising counsel or a professional solicitor.(11) “Sign” means the action of affixing a person’s signature to any document or record, whether by manual, written, or approved electronic means.(12) “Signature” means any mark, symbol, facsimile, or electronic mark or symbol, that depicts a person’s name on any document or record, affixed to the document or record by the person with the intent to authenticate, assert, certify, or agree to the matters, validity, information, or attestation set forth in the document or record.",

Licensed racetracks shall furnish to the commission all information and bank authorizations required to facilitate the timely transfer of moneys to the commission. Licensed racetracks must provide the commission 30 days’ advance notice of any proposed account changes in order to assure the uninterrupted electronic transfer of funds. From the gross terminal income remitted by the licensee to the commission:(1) The commission shall deduct an amount sufficient to reimburse the commission for its actual costs and expenses incurred in administering racetrack video lottery at the licensed racetrack and the resulting amount after the deduction is the net terminal income. The amount deducted for administrative costs and expenses of the commission may not exceed four percent of gross terminal income:Provided, That any amounts deducted by the commission for its actual costs and expenses that exceeds its actual costs and expenses shall be deposited into the State Lottery Fund. For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2011 through June 30, 2030, the term \"actual costs and expenses\" may include transfers of up to $9 million in surplus allocations for each fiscal year, as calculated by the commission when it has closed its books for the fiscal year, to the Licensed Racetrack Modernization Fund created by subdivision (2), of this subsection. For all fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2001, the commission shall not receive an amount of gross terminal income in excess of the amount of gross terminal income received during the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2001, but four percent of any amount of gross terminal income received in excess of the amount of gross terminal income received during the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2001, shall be deposited into the fund established in §29-22-18a of this code; and(2) A Licensed Racetrack Modernization Fund is created within the lottery fund. For all fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2011, and ending with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2030, the commission shall deposit such amounts as are available according to subdivision (1) of this subsection into a separate facility modernization account maintained within the Licensed Racetrack Modernization Fund for each racetrack. Each racetrack’s share of each year’s deposit shall be calculated in the same ratio as each racetrack’s apportioned contribution to the four percent administrative costs and expenses allowance provided for in subdivision (1) of this subsection for that year. For each $2 expended by a licensed racetrack for facility modernization improvements or capital improvements at facilities located in this state that are on or contiguous to the premises of the licensed racetrack, having a useful life of three or more years and placed in service after July 1, 2011, the licensed racetrack shall receive $1 in recoupment from its facility modernization account. If the licensed racetrack’s facility modernization account contains a balance in any fiscal year, the unexpended balance from that fiscal year will be available for matching for one additional fiscal year, after which time, the remaining unused balance carried forward shall revert to the lottery fund. For purposes of this section, the term \"facility modernization improvements\" includes acquisitions of new and unused video lottery terminals and related equipment, and the term \"capital improvements\" means real property that is expected to replace or modernize buildings, equipment, machinery and other tangible property used in connection with the operation of the gaming, hospitality, or entertainment at the facility. Video lottery terminals financed through the recoupment provided in this subdivision must be retained by the licensee in its West Virginia licensed location for a period of not less than five years from the date of initial installation.(c) The amount resulting after the deductions required by subsection (b) of this section constitutes net terminal income that shall be divided as set out in this subsection. For all fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2001, any amount of net terminal income received in excess of the amount of net terminal income received during the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2001, shall be divided as set out in §29-22A-10b of this code. The licensed racetrack’s share is in lieu of all lottery agent commissions and is considered to cover all costs and expenses required to be expended by the licensed racetrack in connection with video lottery operations.

In approving video lottery terminals licensed for placement in this state the commission shall insure that the terminals meet the following hardware specifications:(1) Electrical and mechanical parts and design principles may not subject a player to physical hazards or injury.(2) A surge protector shall be installed on the electrical power supply line to each video lottery terminal. A battery or equivalent power back-up for the electronic meters shall be capable of maintaining accuracy of all accounting records and terminal status reports for a period of one hundred eighty days after power is disconnected from the terminal. The power back-up device shall be located within the locked logic board compartment of the video lottery terminal.(3) An on/off switch which controls the electrical current used in the operation of the terminal shall be located in an accessible place within the interior of the video lottery terminal.(4) The operation of each video lottery terminal may not be adversely affected by any static discharge or other electromagnetic interference.(5) A bill or voucher acceptor or other means accurately and efficiently to establish credits shall be installed on each video lottery terminal. All acceptors shall be approved by the commission prior to use on any video lottery terminal in this state.(6) Access to the interior of video lottery terminal shall be controlled through a series of locks and seals.(7) The main logic boards and all erasable programmable read-only memory chips (\"EPROMS\") are considered to be owned by the commission and shall be located in a separate locked and sealed area within the video lottery terminal.(8) The cash compartment shall be located in a separate locked area within or attached to the video lottery terminal.(9) No hardware switches, jumpers, wire posts or any other means of manipulation may be installed which alter the pay tables or payout percentages in the operation of a game. Hardware switches on a video lottery terminal to control the terminal's graphic routines, speed of play, sound and other purely cosmetic features may be approved by the commission.(10) Each video lottery terminal shall contain a single printing mechanism capable of printing an original ticket and capturing and retaining an electronic copy of the ticket data as approved by the commission: Provided, That the printing mechanism is optional on any video lottery terminal which is designed and equipped exclusively for coin or token payouts. The following information shall be recorded on the ticket when credits accrued on a video lottery terminal are redeemed for cash:(i) The number of credits accrued;(ii) Value of the credits in dollars and cents displayed in both numeric and written form;(iii) Time of day and date;(iv) Validation number; and(v) Any other information required by the commission.(11) A permanently installed and affixed identification plate shall appear on the exterior of each video lottery terminal and the following information shall be on the plate:(i) Manufacturer of the video lottery terminal;(ii) Serial number of the terminal; and(iii) Model number of the terminal.(12) The rules of play for each game shall be displayed on the video lottery terminal face or screen. The commission may reject any rules of play which are incomplete, confusing, misleading or inconsistent with game rules approved by the commission. For each video lottery game, there shall be a display detailing the credits awarded for the occurrence of each possible winning combination of numbers or symbols. All information required by this subdivision shall be displayed under glass or another transparent substance. No stickers or other removable devices may be placed on the video lottery terminal screen or face without the prior approval of the commission.(13) Communication equipment and devices shall be installed to enable each video lottery terminal to communicate with the commission's central computer system by use of a communications protocol provided by the commission to each permitted manufacturer, which protocol shall include information retrieval and terminal activation and disable programs, and the commission may require each licensed racetrack to pay the cost of a central site computer as a part of the licensing requirement.(14) All video lottery terminals shall have a security system which temporarily disables the gaming function of the terminal while opened.(b) Each video lottery terminal shall have a random number generator to determine randomly the occurrence of each specific symbol or number used in video lottery games. A selection process is random if it meets the following statistical criteria:(1) Chi-square test. -- Each symbol or number shall satisfy the ninety-nine percent confidence limit using the standard chi-square statistical analysis of the difference between the expected result and the observed result.(2) Runs test. -- Each symbol or number may not produce a significant statistic with regard to producing patterns of occurrences. Each symbol or number is random if it meets the ninety-nine percent confidence level with regard to the \"runs test\" for the existence of recurring patterns within a set of data.(3) Correlation test. -- Each pair of symbols or numbers is random if it meets the ninety-nine percent confidence level using standard correlation analysis to determine whether each symbol or number is independently chosen without regard to another symbol or number within a single game play.(4) Serial correlation test. -- Each symbol or number is random if it meets the ninety-nine percent confidence level using standard serial correlation analysis to determine whether each symbol or number is independently chosen without reference to the same symbol or number in a previous game.(c) Each video lottery terminal shall pay out no less than eighty percent and no more than ninety-nine percent of the amount wagered.
