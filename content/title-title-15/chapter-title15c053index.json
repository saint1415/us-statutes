The inspector shall receive the ballots and record the name of the voter upon a list to be kept by that inspector for that purpose and immediately write upon each ballot the name of the person who delivered the same to that inspector, the inspector having first administered to each person offering to vote an oath or affirmation in the following words: “You do solemnly swear (or affirm) that you are now a duly registered voter of this election district, that you have not voted and will not vote on this day at any other place in this or any other election district, and that you have been hindered or prevented from casting your vote at the regular place of holding the election in this district, by military interference, or by the requirement of oaths unauthorized by the Constitution and laws of this State.”12 Del.

Duties of inspector at special polling place.(a) The polls authorized to be held by § 5306 of this title shall be held at the place where they are opened unless it be impracticable to hold them there in which event they shall be adjourned to some other place, or places, if necessary, in the election district where they are opened, and there held, and they shall be kept open until 6:00 in the afternoon, when the inspector shall close them.(b) As soon as such polls are closed, the inspector holding them, having first ascertained the number of ballots cast, and for whom and for what office the votes were given, and made a certificate thereof, shall seal up the ballots received by that inspector in a box or envelope, and keep them safely, together with the list of the names of the electors who have deposited their ballots with that inspector, until the time of the meeting of the Superior Court of the inspector’s county, constituted as provided by § 6, article V, of the Constitution of this State, provided by the election laws, when the inspector shall appear before the Court with the ballots and list of voters and that inspector’s certificate, and deliver the certificate to the Court, with an affidavit made by the inspector upon the same, that it contains a true and faithful statement of the number of ballots received by the inspector, the names of the electors who cast them, the number of votes for the different persons voted for and that at the poll held by the inspector, that the inspector did not knowingly receive the ballot of any person not a duly qualified voter within that inspector’s election district according to the Constitution and laws of this State and did not refuse to receive the ballot of any person so qualified, who had been prevented from voting at the regular place of voting by military force or the requirement of an oath unauthorized by the Constitution and laws of this State, and that the inspector determined every matter that came before that inspector and performed every act and duty required of the inspector by law touching the election held by the inspector, truly, faithfully and impartially, according to the best of that inspector’s skill and judgment.12 Del. Laws, c. 491,\n\n§\n\n 2; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 1832; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 1921; \n\n15 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5308;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5308. Canvass of ballots from special polling place.The Superior Court, sitting as a board of canvass, shall receive the certificate, and in ascertaining and certifying the state of the election shall take into consideration the number of ballots certified by the inspector to have been received by that inspector and for whom and what office the votes were given, and give the certificate the same force and effect as a certificate of the election officers at any of the regular places of holding the election. The votes so given shall be reckoned among the number of votes given in the election district where they were received by the inspector, in the same manner as if they had been given at the regular place of voting in the district; provided always, however, that the Court shall be required to hear and determine challenges as to the right of any person, who delivered that person’s own ballot to the inspector, and reject any ballot if the person who cast the same had not a right to vote under the Constitution and laws of this State, either from want of qualification, or by reason of having voted at any other place in the State where the person was entitled to vote on the same day. Such of the ballots so received by the inspector, as are not rejected by the Court and also the list of voters, and the certificate shall be deposited by the Court in the regular ballot box of the election district where they were cast, and the box shall then be immediately resealed by the Court. The Court may also open the ballot box for the purpose. The Court may also examine on oath the inspector touching any matter connected with the inspector’s holding of the election, and may if it appear to it that the election was not fairly held by such inspector, reject the inspector’s certificate and throw out the vote returned by that inspector.12 Del. Laws, c. 491,\n\n§\n\n 3; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 1833; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 1922; \n\n15 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5309;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5309.

And further, if any member of the Court, or any such inspector created by virtue of this title, or any inspector of election, is prevented, by reason of such interference from attending the meeting of the Court, or if the Court, being met, shall be prevented by such interference from performing the duties incumbent on it, the Court shall adjourn to meet at some other time and other place, if necessary, to perform its duties under the laws of this State, and so adjourn from time to time until such duties can be performed. The duty of attendance upon the Court on the part of such an inspector created by authority of this chapter, and the penalties upon such inspector for not appearing shall be the same as in the case of the inspectors regularly elected or appointed according to law.12 Del.
