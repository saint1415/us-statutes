Nominating petitions shall be filed with the Department. Nominations shall be without party or political designation, but the nominating petitions shall contain a statement as to each nominee to the effect that the nominee favors ratification or that the nominee opposes ratification or that the nominee remains uncommitted to either ratification or rejection of the proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and no nominating petition shall contain the name of any nominee whose position as stated therein is inconsistent with that of the position of any other nominee as stated therein.38 Del.

After the closing of such nominations, the Department shall forthwith count and determine the number of signatures which each candidate for nomination as delegate to such convention has obtained upon the candidate’s or the Department’s nominating petition or petitions. In making such count and determination, the Department shall only count the signatures of those persons who are qualified voters of the county which the candidates propose to represent at such convention. A signature to such nominating petition shall be prima facie evidence that the person purporting to sign the same did actually sign the same and that such person is a qualified voter of the same county as the county of residence of the candidate or candidates whose names appear in such nominating petition, and all signatures to such nominating petitions shall be counted by the Department, unless, within 5 days after the closing of nominations, evidence satisfactory to the Department shall have been produced before him or her that a person whose name purports to have been signed to a nominating petition is either a fictitious person or not a qualified voter of the county of residence of the candidate or candidates whose nominating petition the person purports to have signed. After the closing of nominations all nominating petitions shall be open to the inspection of any qualified voter of the county in which such petitions have been filed.38 Del.

The ballots so ordered by the nominees shall be delivered to the nominees or to their agents upon their request or order at least 5 days before the election at which the ballots are to be used.38 Del.

Laws, c. 275,\n\n§\n\n 102;§\n\n7712. Use of separate ballot; form.The election shall be by ballot, separate from any ballot to be used at the same election. Such ballot, if used at a general election, shall be enclosed in the same envelope as the ballot for use at such general election, otherwise each ballot cast shall be enclosed in a separate envelope. The ballot shall first state the substance of the proposed amendment. This shall be followed by appropriate instructions to the voter. It shall then contain perpendicular columns of equal width headed respectively in plain type “For Ratification,” “Against Ratification” and “Uncommitted.” In the column headed “For Ratification” shall be placed the names of the nominees nominated from the entire State as in favor of ratification, in alphabetical order. In the column headed “Against Ratification” shall be placed the names of the nominees nominated from the entire State as against ratification, in alphabetical order. In the column headed “Uncommitted” shall be placed the names of the nominees nominated from the entire State as uncommitted to either ratification or rejection, in alphabetical order. The voter shall indicate that voter’s own choice by making 1 or more cross marks in the appropriate spaces provided on the ballot. No ballot shall be held void because any such cross mark is irregular in character. The ballot shall be so arranged that the voter may by making a single cross mark, vote for the entire group of nominees whose names are comprised in any column. The ballot shall be as like as possible to the form of the official ballot now used in this State and substantially in the following form:CONVENTION TO RATIFY FEDERALDelegates to the Convention to Ratify the Proposed Amendment.The Congress has proposed an amendment to the Constitution of the United States which provides (insert here the substance of the proposed amendment).The Congress has also proposed that the amendment shall be ratified by Conventions in the States.INSTRUCTIONS TO VOTERSDo not vote for more than 17 candidates.To vote for all candidates in favor of Ratification of the proposed amendment, or for all candidates against Ratification of the proposed amendment, or for all candidates who intend to remain uncommitted to either Ratification or Rejection of the proposed amendment, make a cross mark in the Block at the head of the list of candidates for whom you wish to vote.
