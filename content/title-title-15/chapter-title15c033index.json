If the certificate of the contending factions are not received by the Board in time for them to assemble at Dover before publishing the device and list of candidates in the newspapers, then and in that case the Board shall determine for itself which faction shall be entitled to the name, title, figure or device and shall select a name, title, figure or device for the other faction.19 Del.
