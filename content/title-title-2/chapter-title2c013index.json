Legislative findings and determinations.(a) The General Assembly finds that:(1) There is a continuing need to apply the resources of the State to implement plans for air, water, vehicular, public and specialized transportation in the State;(2) There is a continuing need to implement such plans on a comprehensive and integrated basis for the benefit of all people in the State and the users of those facilities from other states in order to obtain an economical, efficient and unified system of air, water, vehicular, public and specialized transportation;(3) There is a continuing need to provide methods for financing existing and future transportation facilities in the State to maintain and develop such economical transportation systems for the health, welfare, convenience and safety of the people of the State and the users of those facilities from other states; and(4) Air, water, vehicular, public and specialized transportation facilities form a unified system of transportation because, among other reasons:a.

Bonds.The Authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution, at 1 time or from time to time, for the issuance of duly authorized bonds of the Authority for any of its corporate purposes, including the refunding of its bonds. The principal of, premium, if any, and the interest on any issue of bonds shall be payable solely from, and may be secured by, a pledge and assignment of revenues, provided, that the proceeds of any bonds may be used, pledged and assigned for the establishment of any or all reserves for such payment or security or for other corporate purposes as the Authority may authorize in its resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or in a trust agreement securing the same.The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, shall mature at such time or times, may be redeemed before maturity, at the option of the Authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, all as may be fixed by the Authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The Authority shall determine the form of the bonds including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State. The bonds shall be signed by the Secretary or shall bear the Secretary’s facsimile signature and the official seal of the Authority or a facsimile thereof shall be impressed, imprinted, engraved or otherwise reproduced thereon. The official seal or facsimile thereof shall be attested by the Director of the Office of Financial Management and Budget and/or the Administrator of the Transportation Trust Fund or by such other officer or agent as the Authority shall appoint and authorize and any coupons attached to such bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the Secretary. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if the officer had remained in office until such delivery. All bonds issued under this chapter are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the Uniform Commercial Code of the State. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner, whether at public or private sale, and for such price, as it may determine to be in the best interests of the Authority. Neither the Secretary nor any person executing the bonds shall be personally liable on the bonds or be accountable by reason of execution of any bonds or the issuance thereof in accordance with this chapter.The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the Authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, subject to this chapter.Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed. Bonds may be issued under this chapter without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau or agency of the State, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this chapter.Any bonds issued under this chapter may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State. Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge and assign revenues to which the Authority’s right then exists or may thereafter come into existence, and the moneys derived therefrom, and the proceeds of such bonds, but shall not convey or mortgage any road, highway, bridge, tunnel, overpass, underpass, interchange, entrance plaza, exit or approach constituting a portion of a turnpike. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the holders of bonds as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, reconstruction, improvement, extension, alteration, modernization, repair, operation and maintenance of transportation facilities, the charges, fares, fees, rates, rentals and tolls to be imposed, the payment, security or redemption of bonds, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and provisions for the employment of persons in connection with the undertaking, maintenance or operation of such transportation facilities. Any such trust agreement or resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of the holders of bonds and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual rights of action by holders of bonds. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the holders of bonds, subject to this chapter. All expenses incurred in carrying out such resolution or trust agreement may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of a transportation facility.It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the State which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority.This section is intended and shall be construed to authorize the Authority to finance any transportation facility or any combination of transportation facilities by any combination of issues or series of bonds which may be secured by the pledge of revenues derived from any transportation facility or facilities or combination of such facilities designated by the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or by any trust agreement securing such bonds.62 Del.

The approval of amounts to be expended for such purposes in an annual capital improvements project schedule shall constitute the approval of the issuance of bonds in such amounts for such purposes. Bond issued for such purposes may include additional amounts necessary to fund reserves and to pay costs of issuing the bonds.The Authority may issue bonds to refund any bonds previously issued by the Authority for any purpose and to fund reserves and pay costs of issuing bonds without the approval of the General Assembly.No bonds shall be issued by the Authority for any purpose, including any refunding bonds, unless the Authority has obtained an independent report from a qualified firm stating, on the basis of revenues transferred to and/or collected by the Authority in the fiscal year next prior to the year in which the report is prepared, that it is reasonable to assume, after giving effect to the issuance of bonds proposed to be issued (assuming that the principal and interest payments on such bonds will be the principal and interest payments on those bonds in the fiscal year in which the greatest amount of principal and interest will be payable on those bonds), that sufficient revenues will be available to make the reimbursements from the motor fuel tax reimbursement fund and the motor carrier registration reimbursement fund required by this chapter to be made for the next 5 fiscal years including the fiscal year of the issuance of such bonds. The report may assume that the amount of revenues deposited in the turnpike improvement fund, the interstate operations fund, and the interstate improvement fund, as defined in the trust agreement dated September 1, 1979, between the Authority and the trustee for certain outstanding bonds of the Authority, will not be increased during that 5 year period.

Liability of Authority.(a) Any operation, service or program provided by the Delaware Transportation Authority or under its auspices not covered by a general liability policy, self-insurance or other insurance policy as shall be legally established and funded by said Authority shall be covered and protected by the doctrine of sovereign immunity of the State which shall be applicable not only to the Authority but to each of its agencies, administrations, subsidiaries and each of their respective officers and employees; which immunity shall apply to and against any lawsuit or liability arising from any such operation, service or program, except as specifically excepted under this section. No legal or equitable action seeking damages as a result of any operation, service or program described in the preceding sentence shall be permitted or damages recovered except as such activity is and shall be covered by an insurance program procured in accordance with law and for which adequate funding is available. In the event that insurance has been provided, such claim, including any award for damages or costs assessed against the Authority, its administrations, subsidiaries, officers or employees either individually or on behalf of their employer shall not exceed the amount of said insurance covering the risk or loss or the amount of $1,000,000 whichever amount shall be the lesser for any and all claims arising out of a single occurrence.(b) For fiscal years beginning July 1, 1997, and thereafter, the annual budget of the Delaware Transit Corporation shall include funding for an insurance program as described in subsection (a) of this section.

Limitation of actions to recover payments erroneously or illegally collected by the Authority.No action or claim that is otherwise permitted against the State or an agency or authority of the State to recover any charges, fares, fees, rentals or tolls or other payments erroneously or illegally collected by or paid to the Authority may be commenced or otherwise asserted after expiration of 1 year from the earlier of:(1) The date of the payment; or(2) The date the payment was required to be made.68 Del.

Laws, c. 290,\n\n§\n\n 189;69 Del. Laws, c. 435,\n\n§\n\n 32;§\n\n1332. Passenger rail carriers.(a) The General Assembly has determined as a matter of public policy that it is in the best interests of the citizens of Delaware to apply a limitation of liability for any passenger rail carrier, not otherwise protected under State law, in order to financially enable the Authority acting through the Delaware Transit Corporation and such rail carriers to provide such service. No legal or equitable action seeking damages for personal injury or death as a result of any operation, service or program shall be permitted, maintained or recovered against the owner and/or operator of passenger rail service within State boundaries which has contracted with the Authority acting through the Delaware Transit Corporation to provide such service except as otherwise indicated herein.(b) It is the expressed intent of the General Assembly, as a matter of public policy, to extend the immunity of the State to all owners and operators of rail facilities and/or providing such rail operations pursuant to an agreement with the Delaware Transportation Authority acting through the Delaware Transit Corporation specifically referencing this section. Any such waiver of immunity from lawsuit or liability whether by operation of law or contract shall be strictly limited to the terms of this section.(c) The Delaware Transportation Authority acting through the Delaware Transit Corporation is expressly given authority to contract with 1 or more rail service operators hereinafter referred to as “contractors” to maintain and operate rail service between points in Pennsylvania and Delaware, within Delaware and/or between points in Maryland and Delaware, and to indemnify and save harmless said contractors from any and all liability to the extent such indemnification shall be covered by insurance either through a commercially procured policy or through a self-insurance fund as shall be determined by the Authority acting through the Delaware Transit Corporation and approved by the General Assembly and in conformance with § 1329 of this title. For the purposes of this section, rail service operators shall include but not be limited to SEPTA (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority), AMTRAK (National Railroad Passenger Corporation), MARC (Mass Transit Administration, Maryland Commuter Rail) and CONRAIL (Consolidated Rail Corporation).69 Del. Laws, c. 77,\n\n§\n\n 68;69 Del. Laws, c. 435,\n\n§\n\n 33;§§\n\n1333, 1334. [Reserved.]§\n\n1335. Maintaining adequate supplies of road materials [Operation of this statute was suspended by 85 Del. Laws, c. 64, § 113].(a)Legislative findings. —The General Assembly finds that the interests of the State are not well served when its ability to obtain a ready supply and competitive prices for critical materials used in its transportation projects, such as asphalt and concrete, is impeded due to the consolidation of ownership of facilities for the processing and/or manufacture of such materials in specific geographic areas. This situation has arisen in Kent and Sussex Counties, and may potentially occur in New Castle County. Therefore, the General Assembly determines that the State should be empowered to enter into appropriate arrangements to reduce the impacts of these consolidations.(b) Any provision of the Delaware Code notwithstanding, the Department of Transportation is hereby authorized and directed to develop and implement a program to obtain a ready supply of critical road-building materials, including but not limited to asphalt and/or concrete, for its highway construction and reconstruction projects. This program may include the acquisition of land, raw materials, and equipment to operate facilities for the processing and manufacture of road materials. The Department may also contract with private entities for the operation of such facilities, pursuant to Chapter 69 of Title 29.(c) The provisions of §§ 1309, 1319, 1321, and 1329 of this title shall apply to the Department’s actions pursuant to this section, including any contractual arrangements for these facilities, as if conducted under the auspices of the Delaware Transportation Authority, except that during its planning process the Department shall meet and confer with the land use officials in the county in which such facilities will be located, to obtain their comments on the proposal.(d) Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this section, the authorities granted to the Department in aforementioned section, the Department shall not contract for any additional capacity with a private firm or firms without first securing the approval of the State Representative and Senator in whose legislative districts the proposed road materials facility would be located.74 Del.
