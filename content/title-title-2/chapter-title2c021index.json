A guide for the specific design of the physical form, public spaces, and amenities of the District so that transit, walking, and cycling are safe and comfortable modes of travel for all the residents of the District.c. An agreement on level of service requirements specific to the District.(c) Once a master development plan has been created, the Department shall conduct a transportation planning study to evaluate existing and proposed future conditions in and around the District boundaries agreed to under this section. The study shall determine the effects of creating the District and identify the projects needed within the District to implement the policies defined in § 2105 of this title and the projects needed outside the District to meet the highway capacity and quality of service standards of the Department and the county or municipality in which the District is located. The Department shall publish this study on its website at least 10 business days prior to any hearing required under § 2662, §4962, or §6962 of Title 9 or § 312 of Title 22.80 Del.
