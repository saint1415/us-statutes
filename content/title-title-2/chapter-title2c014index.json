All other obligations of the Authority shall be authorized by resolution containing terms and conditions as the Authority shall determine.(e) Bonds of the Authority may be sold at a price or prices and in a manner as provided in § 1311 of this title.(f) Bonds may be issued and other obligations incurred under this chapter without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau or agency of the State, and without any other proceeding or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this chapter.(g) Bonds of the Authority issued or incurred under this chapter shall not be in any way a debt or liability of the State or of any political subdivision thereof other than the Authority and shall not create or constitute any indebtedness, liability or obligation of the State or of any political subdivision or be or constitute a pledge of the faith and credit of the State or of any political subdivision, but all bonds unless funded or refunded by bonds of the Authority shall be payable solely from revenues or funds pledged or available for their payment as authorized in this chapter. Each bond shall contain on its face a statement to the effect that the Authority is obligated to pay the principal thereof, premium, if any, or the interest thereon only from revenues or funds of the Authority made available for that purpose and that neither the State nor any political subdivision is obligated to pay the principal, premium, if any, or interest thereon and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State or any political subdivision thereof is pledged to the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the bonds.
