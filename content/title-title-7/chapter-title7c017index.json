Penalties.(a) Whoever violates this chapter, unless otherwise specifically provided, shall be fined not less than $50 or more than $100 for each offense. For each subsequent offense, the person shall be fined not less than $100 or more than $250. All fines imposed following a conviction for violation for any section of this subchapter shall be remitted by the sentencing court or voluntary assessment center to the county in which the offense occurred.(b)Applicability. —Any duly constituted law-enforcement officer of this State or any of its political subdivisions, the county, or any animal welfare officer employed by the county who charges a person with any offense which is a violation of a law, ordinance or regulation established or promulgated under the authority of this chapter shall, in addition to issuing a summons for any such offense, provide the alleged violator with a voluntary assessment form which, when properly executed by the officer, allows the offender to dispose of the charge without the necessity of personally appearing in the court to which the summons is returnable.(c)Definitions. —(1) “Payment” as used in this section shall mean the total amount of the fine and costs as herein provided and any assessment added to the fine pursuant to Delaware law.(2) “Voluntary assessment form” as used in this section shall mean the written document issued to an alleged violator which advises such person that they may dispose of the charge without the necessity of personally appearing in court by paying the fine together with any costs and statutory assessments.(d)Places and time of payment. —Payments made pursuant to this section shall be remitted to the voluntary assessment center or court to which the summons is returnable and shall be disbursed to the county in which the offense occurred. The payment must be received by the voluntary assessment center or court within 30 days from the date of arrest (excluding Saturday and Sunday) and shall be paid only by check or money order or by electronic means as authorized by the voluntary assessment center.(e)Offenses designated as “offenses subject to voluntary assessment” exceptions. —All offenses, as now or hereafter set forth in this chapter, or ordinances or regulations promulgated under authority thereof, are hereby designated as offenses subject to voluntary assessment except for violations punishable under § 3079F of Title 16.(f)Offer and acceptance of voluntary assessment; effect; request for hearing. —(1) At the time of making an arrest for any offense subject to this section, the arresting officer, or animal welfare officer may offer the alleged violator the option of accepting a voluntary assessment. The alleged violator’s acceptance of the voluntary assessment constitutes an acknowledgment of guilt of the offense stated in the form, and an agreement to pay the fine as herein provided, together with costs and assessments, within 30 days from the date of arrest (excluding Saturday and Sunday), during which time payment must be received by the applicable court or voluntary assessment center.(2) In lieu of paying the voluntary assessment, a person who has been issued a voluntary assessment form may request a hearing on any charge stated in such form by notifying, in writing, the voluntary assessment center or court to which payment was to be made of such request within 30 days of the date of arrest. If the alleged violator makes a timely request for a hearing, the charge shall be prosecuted as if the voluntary assessment had not been permitted and the officer shall swear to the summons prior to trial.(g)Penalty. —If an alleged violator elects the option of accepting a voluntary assessment in accordance with subsection (f) of this section, the penalty imposed shall be the minimum fine for each offense charged, and fines shall be cumulative if more than 1 offense is charged.(h)Court costs and assessments. —In lieu of any other court costs, and provided the offense is not subject to other proceedings under this section, each fine for an offense under this section shall be subject to court costs of $20, unless otherwise provided by court rule in lieu thereof. Each fine for an offense under this section shall be subject to all penalty assessments which are provided for in Chapter 90 of Title 11 or any other provision of the Code.(i)Agreement to accept voluntary assessment; procedure. —Whenever a person is arrested for commission of an offense subject to voluntary assessment and has elected to make payment as herein provided, the arresting officer, using the uniform Delaware complaint and summons citation, shall complete the information section and prepare the voluntary assessment form indicating the amount of the fine, and give a copy of the citation and form to the arrested person and release the arrested person from custody. The arresting officer shall also inform the arrested person of the court or voluntary assessment center to which payment should be submitted if the person does not request a hearing. No officer shall receive or accept custody of a payment. If the person declines to accept voluntary assessment, the arresting officer shall issue a citation and summons or, if appropriate, follow the procedure for arrest as set forth in Chapter 19 of Title 11.(j)Payment of fine as complete satisfaction; repeat offenders. —(1) Payment of the prescribed fine, costs and penalty assessment is a complete satisfaction of the violation, except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, but does not waive any administrative penalty in the nature of license revocation which may lawfully be revoked by a county.(2) In the event that following compliance with the payment provisions of this section, it is determined that within the 2-year period immediately preceding the violation, the violator was convicted of or made a payment pursuant to this section in satisfaction of a violation of the same section of this title, personal appearance before the court to which the summons is returnable shall be required. Notice of the time and place for the required court appearance shall be given to the violator by the court to which the summons for the offense would be returnable.(k)Removal from applicability of section. —If a payment due pursuant to this section is not received by voluntary assessment center or the court to which the summons is returnable within 30 days from the date of arrest (excluding Saturday and Sunday), the violator shall be prosecuted for the offense charged on the voluntary assessment form in a manner as if a voluntary assessment form had not been issued. Upon conviction in such prosecution, the court shall impose penalties as provided for by this chapter and this section.(l)Nonexclusive procedure. —The procedure prescribed is not exclusive of any other method prescribed by law for the arrest and prosecution of persons violating this chapter.Code 1915,\n\n§\n\n 2406E;34 Del.
