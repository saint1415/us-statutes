It is a shallow wire or netting mesh bag attached to a wooden or metal frame which has a handle. It is pushed over the bottom.(57) “Recreational finfisher” shall mean any person who takes, catches, kills or reduces to possession any species of finfish taken from the tidal waters of this State by said person and who does not sell, trade or barter or attempt to sell, trade or barter said finfish.(58) “Resident” shall mean any person who has continuously resided within this State for 1 year prior to the date in question.(59) “Run around gill net” or “ring net” shall mean a gill net that is set around a school of finfish by 1 or more vessels.

The 2 outside webs or walls of netting are of a larger mesh than the inside webbing. The inside net has a greater depth and hangs loosely between the outer panels of webbing. A finfish swimming from either side of the fishing gear passes through the larger mesh outer panel and strikes the smaller mesh middle panel and the finfish is carried through 1 of the openings of the other larger mesh panel, forming a sack or pocket in which the finfish is entrapped.
