Definitions.(a) “Department” means the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.(b) “Maintenance” means the actions required to return a channel, bridge, culvert, stormwater basin or water control structure to its full operational condition or to prevent a decline in its utility. These actions shall not change the purpose, scope or capacity of the channel, bridge, culvert, stormwater basin or water control structure.(c) “Ordinary high water mark” means, for nontidal waters, the line at which the presence and action of water are so continuous in all ordinary years so as to leave a distinct mark on a bank either by erosion or destruction of terrestrial (nonaquatic) vegetation, or that can be determined by other physical or biological means.(d) “Reconstruction” means the rebuilding of a channel, bridge, culvert, stormwater basin or water control structure that requires significant renovation or repair of their major structural features. This rebuilding shall be characterized by a replacement or major restorative effort similar to the degree required in the original design and construction of the channel, bridge, culvert, stormwater basin or water control structure. This rebuilding shall not change the purpose, scope or capacity of the channel, bridge, culvert, stormwater basin or water control structure.(e) “Retrofitting” means a change in design, construction or materials to an existing bridge, culvert, stormwater basin or water control structure in order to incorporate later improvements or to reflect new standards, criteria or needs not considered in the original design and construction.(f) “Secretary” means the Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.(g) “Subaqueous lands” means submerged lands and tidelands.(h) “Submerged lands” means:(1) Lands lying below the line of mean low tide in the beds of all tidal waters within the boundaries of the State;(2) Lands lying below the plane of the ordinary high water mark of nontidal rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, bays and inlets within the boundaries of the State as established by law; and(3) Specific manmade lakes or ponds as designated by the Secretary.(i) “Tidelands” means lands lying between the line of mean high water and the line of mean low water.65 Del.

Jurisdiction.(a) The Secretary shall have jurisdiction over any project involving ungranted subaqueous lands owned by the State, and shall have jurisdiction and authority to convey a fee simple of lesser interest or to grant an easement with respect to all projects involving these lands. All jurisdiction and authority remaining in the State as to subaqueous lands for which leases have been made or may be made is invested in the Secretary.(b) Owners of private subaqueous lands must obtain a permit from the Department before making any use of such lands which may contribute to the pollution of public waters, infringe upon the rights of the public, infringe upon the rights of other private owners or make connection with public subaqueous lands.65 Del. Laws, c. 508,\n\n§\n\n 2;68 Del. Laws, c. 76,\n\n§\n\n 3;§\n\n7204.

Such permit, lease or letter of approval, if granted, may include reasonable conditions required in the judgment of the Department to protect the interests of the public. The Department may adopt regulations setting fees for such permits. If it is determined that granting the permit, lease or approval will result in loss to the public of a substantial resource, the permittee may be required to take measures which will offset or mitigate the loss. This section shall not apply to any repairs or structural replacements which are above the mean low tide and which do not increase any dimensions or change the use of the structure.(b) The Secretary shall annually prepare a schedule of fees for permits issued pursuant to this section and submit the same as part of the Department’s annual operating budget proposal.(c) The Secretary may waive any provision of the regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter when warranted under the following circumstances:(1) Life-threatening emergencies.(2) Actions required for public safety for which sufficient time is not available to follow the regulations.(3) When imminent or catastrophic damage or loss of major infrastructure is likely if all provisions of the regulations are adhered to.(4) Where the authority of the Department under this chapter overlaps with another statute, including but not limited to shellfish grounds (Chapter 19 of this title), wetlands (Chapter 66 of this title) or beach preservation (Chapter 68 of this title) provided that the following criteria are met:a. If, in the opinion of the Secretary, equal environmental impact review and regulation of the activity would be provided by either statute; andb. Waiver of these regulations would not be contrary to the purposes of this chapter.(d) The Secretary may issue an after-the-fact permit, lease, letter of approval or waiver in those cases where an activity has occurred without first obtaining the required permit, lease, letter of approval or waiver. The determination of whether or not to issue an after-the-fact permit, lease, letter of approval or waiver shall be consistent with the purposes and provisions of this chapter. The applicant receiving the after-the-fact permit, lease, letter of approval, or waiver will be responsible for paying any associated processing fee and lease fee and the Secretary may assess a penalty in accordance with § 6005 of this title.65 Del.
