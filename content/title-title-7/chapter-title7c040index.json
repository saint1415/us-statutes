Runoff Control near Mill Creek, Little Mill, Red Clay, White Clay Creek, Persimmon Creek and Shellpot Creek.All land development subject to this chapter in the Mill Creek, Little Mill Creek, Red Clay Creek, White Clay Creek, Persimmon Creek and Shellpot Creek watersheds of New Castle County will, in addition to meeting all other requirements for stormwater management, be required to demonstrate successful management of any increase in stormwater runoff volume from predevelopment land use conditions. Successful management of increased stormwater volume shall include but not be limited to; recharge, infiltration and reuse where soils and site conditions are applicable. For any increase in volume that cannot be recharged, infiltrated or reused, volume management may be achieved by modifying the release rate for the increase in volume so as not to increase the flood elevation for all storms up to and including the 100-year return period.75 Del. Laws, c. 433,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4004. Applicability.(a) The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to agricultural land management practices unless the conservation district or the Department determines that the land requires a new or updated soil and water conservation plan, and the owner or operator of the land has refused either to apply to a conservation district for the development of such a plan, or to implement a plan developed by a conservation district.(b) The Department shall adopt standard plans for the construction of agriculture structures and it shall not be necessary for any person seeking approval to submit a sediment and stormwater management plan.(c) Utility projects disturbing less than 5,000 square feet of land are not subject to the provisions of this chapter.(d) Subject to sediment and erosion controls, land disturbing activities of 1 acre or less, excluding nonresidential properties, are not subject to the provisions of this chapter.(e) Land disturbing activities not subject to the land management practices set forth in subsection (a) of this section which are conducted on 10 acres or less of agricultural lands for agricultural purposes shall be subject to standard plans adopted by the Department, and it shall not be necessary for any person seeking approval to submit a detailed sediment and stormwater management plan.(f) Subject to water quality management and sediment and erosion controls, nonerosive conveyances of stormwater discharges from land disturbing activities which drain into tidal areas and tidal waters are not subject to the quantity management provisions of this chapter.(g) Linear water and wastewater utility projects that have a maximum width of disturbance of 30 feet or less and with a maximum total disturbance of 1 acre or less are: (i) subject to Erosion and Sediment Control regulations adopted by the Department, and (ii) exempt from Stormwater Management regulation adopted by the Department. For the purposes of this section “erosion and sediment control” means the control of solid material, both mineral and organic, during a land disturbing activity, to prevent its transport out of the disturbed area by means of wind, water, gravity, or ice. For the purposes of this section “stormwater management” means:(1) For water quantity control, a system of vegetative, structural, and other measurers that controls the volume and rate of stormwater runoff which may be caused by land disturbing activities upon the land; and(2) For water quality control, a system of vegetative, structural, and other measures that controls adverse effects on water quality that may be caused by land disturbing activities upon the land.(h) [Expired.]61 Del.

Program funding and financial assistance [For application of this section, see 85 Del. Laws, c. 42, § 10].(a) The Department, conservation districts, counties or municipalities are authorized to receive from federal, state, or other public or private sources financial, technical or other assistance for use in accomplishing the purposes of this chapter. The Department may allocate, as necessary or desirable, any funds received to conservation districts, counties or municipalities for the purpose of effectuating this chapter.(b) The conservation districts, counties and municipalities shall have authority to adopt a fee system to help fund program implementation. That fee system shall be implemented by the designated plan approval agency to fund overall program management, plan review, construction review, enforcement needs and maintenance responsibilities. In those situations where the Department becomes the designated plan approval agency, the Department may assess a plan review and inspection fee. That fee shall not exceed $975 per disturbed acre per project. There shall be no duplication of fees by the various implementing agencies for an individual land disturbing activity and the fee schedule shall be based upon the costs to the Department, conservation districts, counties or municipalities to implement and administer the program. In addition, the Department of Transportation is authorized to act as the designated plan approval agency in those situations where a public utility engages in land-disturbing activity for which a permit is required because of a project initiated by the Department of Transportation, subject to the following provisions:(1) If the land-disturbing activity takes place on an existing right-of-way of the Department of Transportation, that Department is permitted to assess and collect a fee for this purpose which shall not exceed $125 per acre, with a $250 minimum.(2) If the land-disturbing activity takes place adjacent to but not upon an existing right-of-way of the Department of Transportation, the fee contemplated by paragraph (b)(1) of this section is waived.(c) Authority is also granted to the Department, conservation districts, counties or municipalities to establish a stormwater utility as an alternative to total funding under the fee system. The stormwater utility shall be developed for the designated watersheds and may fund such activities as long range watershed master planning, watershed retrofitting, and facility maintenance. This fee system shall be reasonable and equitable so that each contributor of runoff to the system, including state agencies, shall pay to the extent to which runoff is contributed. Criteria for the implementation of the stormwater utility shall be established in regulations promulgated under this chapter. The implementation of a stormwater utility will necessitate the development of a local utility ordinance prior to its implementation.61 Del. Laws, c. 522,\n\n§\n\n 1;67 Del.

The regulations shall specify variances which expand this time limitation in specific situation; and(11) Establish a means of communication, such as a newsletter, so that information regarding program development and implementation can be distributed to interested individuals.(c) The Department shall develop such regulations in conjunction with and with substantial concurrence of a regulatory advisory committee, appointed by the Secretary, which shall include representatives of the regulated community and others affected by this chapter. The Secretary shall appoint only 1 representative of the Department to the regulatory advisory committee and no legal representatives of any of those serving on the committee shall be entitled to be a member of the committee. The recommendations of this committee shall be presented at all public workshops and hearings related to the adoption of the regulations implementing this chapter. Prior to final promulgation of regulations under this chapter, the Secretary shall explain, in writing, any differences between the advisory committee recommendations and the final regulations. The regulations may include, but are not limited to, the following items:(1) Criteria for the delegation of program elements;(2) Types of activities consistent with the provisions of this chapter that require a sediment and stormwater management permit;(3) Waivers, exemptions and variances;(4) Sediment and stormwater plan approval fees and performance bonds;(5) Criteria for distribution of funds collected by sediment and stormwater plan approval fees;(6) Criteria for implementation of a stormwater runoff utility;(7) Specific design criteria and minimum standards, and specifications, provided that any design criteria, standards and specifications adopted shall be technologically feasible and uniformly capable of being satisfied;(8) Permit application and approval requirements;(9) Criteria for approval of designated watersheds;(10) Criteria regarding attendance and completion of departmental sponsored or approved training courses in sediment and stormwater control that will be required of certified construction reviewers and responsible personnel;(11) Construction review; and(12) Maintenance requirements for sediment control during construction and stormwater management structures after construction is completed.(d) (1) The Department may adopt, amend, modify or repeal rules and regulations after public hearing to effectuate the policy and purposes of this chapter. The conduct of all hearings conducted pursuant to this chapter and the promulgation process shall be in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 60 of this title, and all other provisions of Delaware law. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of Delaware law, the Department and any other approval authority shall, for purposes of approval, after June 24, 2016, review required applications for land disturbing activities using the guidelines set forth herein until such time that the Department adopts new regulations which become final pursuant to the requirements of this chapter. The guidelines to be used are as follows:a. The Resource Protections Event Volume (RPv) is equal to a runoff volume generated by a 2.7\" storm event. Treatment of a 1-inch runoff from a RPv event with best management practices (BMPs) as set forth in the April 2016 Post Construction Stormwater Management BMP Standards and Specifications or functional equivalents is required. If additional measures are necessary to manage the remainder of runoff from the RPv to achieve the predevelopment runoff rate from the RPv, then additional BMPs shall be utilized to achieve the predevelopment runoff rate and shall be considered sufficient for purposes of obtaining plan approval.b. RPV compliance for redevelopment projects as defined herein must employ the same BMPs set forth above to reduce the existing effective imperviousness by 15%.c. Runoff rates for the 10-year and 100-year storm events must be managed in accordance with the referenced BMPs, exclusive of volume requirements.(2) In lieu of satisfying the guidelines in paragraphs (d)(1)a. and (d)(1)b. of this section, nothing shall preclude an applicant from utilizing in whole or in part the 2016 emergency regulations and guidelines prior to the adoption of the referenced new regulations.(3) The guidelines cited in paragraphs (d)(1)a. and (d)(1)b. of this section shall be included in the new regulations which are to be adopted.(e) A regulation promulgated by the Department under this chapter that provides for the use of a standard plan in lieu of a detailed sediment and stormwater management plan shall provide that an agricultural structure construction project with a total land disturbance of 10 acres or less is entitled to a standard plan.(f) Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (c) of this section, in developing a state stormwater management program the Department may not promulgate a regulation that relies on a stormwater runoff volume reduction approach.(g) A regulation promulgated by the Department under this chapter shall comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Chapter 104 of Title 29, and shall include both a regulatory impact statement under § 10404A of Title 29 and a regulatory flexibility analysis under § 10404B of Title 29, even if such a statement or analysis would otherwise not be required by § 10404A(b)(1) or § 10404B(b)(1) of Title 29.(h) The provisions of Chapter 60 of this title and of Chapter 101 and Chapter 104 of Title 29 with respect to the adoption of rules and regulations shall not apply to regulatory guidance documents, interpretive rules, or general statements of policy adopted by the Department to support the regulations promulgated under this chapter. A regulatory guidance document, interpretive rule, or general statement of policy shall not:(1) Impose any new or additional requirements beyond those set forth in this chapter and the regulations promulgated by authority of this chapter; or(2) Be used by the Department as a substitute for the provisions of this chapter or the stormwater regulations for enforcement purposes.(i) As used in this section, a \"regulatory guidance document\" means any technical manual, checklist, policy memorandum, form, BMP standards and specifications, Delaware Sediment and Erosion Control Handbook or other similar document, used by the Department to facilitate compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the regulations promulgated by authority of this chapter. Any changes to regulatory guidance documents, as defined in this section, shall be adopted following public notice requirements in accordance with § 6004 of this title and shall be filed in the Register of Regulations pursuant to § 10113 of Title 29.61 Del. Laws, c. 522,\n\n§\n\n 1;67 Del. Laws, c. 234,\n\n§\n\n 1;80 Del. Laws, c. 274,\n\n§§\n\n3, 4;81 Del. Laws, c. 316,\n\n§§\n\n3, 6;§\n\n4007. Local sediment and stormwater programs.(a) Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Department, each conservation district, county, municipality or state agency may adopt, and submit to the Department for approval, 1 or more components of a sediment and stormwater program for the area within its jurisdiction.(b) Requests for delegation of program elements shall be submitted within 6 months of the promulgation of state regulations, and by January 1 of subsequent years if delegation is desired at a future date. The Secretary shall grant or deny such a request on or before April 1 of the year for which delegation is sought.(c) Delegation, once applied for, shall become effective on July 1 and shall not exceed 5 years, at which time delegation renewal is required.(d) A district, county, municipality or state agency may develop the program in cooperation with any other governmental subdivisions.(e) Initial consideration regarding delegation of program elements shall be given to the conservation districts, since the conservation districts, having unique capabilities and areawide responsibilities, are in an ideal position to coordinate and implement local sediment and stormwater programs.61 Del. Laws, c. 522,\n\n§\n\n 1;67 Del. Laws, c. 234,\n\n§\n\n 1;81 Del. Laws, c. 316,\n\n§\n\n4;§\n\n4008.
