      "text": "§\n\n 6601;59 Del. Laws, c. 213,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n6602. Purpose.It is declared that much of the wetlands of this State have been lost or despoiled by unregulated dredging, dumping, filling and like activities and that the remaining wetlands of this State are in jeopardy of being lost or despoiled by these and other activities; that such loss or despoliation will adversely affect, if not entirely eliminate, the value of such wetlands as sources of nutrients to finfish, crustacea and shellfish of significant economic value; that such loss or despoliation will destroy such wetlands as habitats for plants and animals of significant economic and ecological value and will eliminate or substantially reduce marine commerce, recreation and aesthetic enjoyment; that such loss or despoliation will, in most cases, disturb the natural ability of wetlands to reduce flood damage and adversely affect the public health and welfare; that such loss or despoliation will substantially reduce the capacity of such wetlands to absorb silt and will thus result in the increased silting of channels and harbor areas to the detriment of free navigation. It is hereby determined that the coastal areas of Delaware are the most critical areas for the present and future quality of life in the State and that the preservation of the coastal wetlands is crucial to the protection of the natural environment of these coastal areas. Therefore, it is declared to be the public policy of this State to preserve and protect the productive public and private wetlands and to prevent their despoliation and destruction consistent with the historic right of private ownership of lands.7 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 6602;59 Del. Laws, c. 213,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n6603.

The particular amount and the particular conditions of the bond required shall be consistent with and in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter. The Secretary shall state for the record, the basis for the bonding requirements imposed with each permit granted. In the event of a breach of any condition of any such bond, the Attorney General may institute an action in Superior Court upon such bond and prosecute the same to judgment and execution.7 Del.

Appeal from Board’s decision.(a) Any person or persons, jointly or severally affected by any decision or nondecision of the Board, or any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the State, may appeal to the Superior Court in and for the county in which the use in question is wholly or principally located by filing a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Any such appeal shall be perfected within 30 days of the decision of the Board.(b) The Court may affirm, reverse or modify the Board’s decision. The Board’s findings of fact shall not be set aside unless the Court determines that the record contains no substantial evidence that would reasonably support the findings. If the Court finds that additional evidence should be taken, the Court may remand the cause to the Board for completion of the record.7 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 6612;59 Del. Laws, c. 213,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n6613. Taking without just compensation.If the Superior Court finds that the action appealed from constitutes a taking without just compensation, it shall invalidate the order and grant appropriate relief, unless the Secretary at this stage, consents to the reversal or modification of his or her decision. However, the Secretary may, through negotiation or condemnation proceedings under Chapter 61 of Title 10, acquire the fee simple or any lesser interest, including but not limited to, a perpetual negative easement or other interest which assures that the affected land shall not thereafter be altered, dredged, dumped upon, filled or otherwise altered subject to any reasonable reservations to the landowner as the Secretary may have stipulated to prior to assessment of damages. A decision of the Superior Court that the action appealed from constitutes a taking without just compensation shall not become effective for 2 years of the date of decision and shall not become effective at all if within that period the Secretary has initiated action to acquire fee simple or any lesser interest in the wetlands in question. A finding of the Superior Court that the denial of a permit or the restrictions imposed by a granted permit constitutes a taking without just compensation shall not affect any land other than that of the petitioning landowner. If the Secretary has not initiated action to acquire fee simple or any lesser interest in the wetlands in question within 2 years from the date of a final court ruling, the permit must be granted as applied.7 Del.

Inconsistent laws superseded; all other laws unimpaired.All laws or ordinances inconsistent with any provision of this chapter are hereby superseded to the extent of the inconsistency; provided, that present and future zoning powers of all counties and municipalities, to the extent that said powers are not inconsistent with this chapter, shall not hereby be impaired; and provided, that a permit granted under this chapter shall not authorize an activity in contravention of county or municipal zoning regulations.7 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 6618;59 Del. Laws, c. 213,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n6619.
