Immediately upon seizure, such property shall be deemed to be confiscated and the Commissioner shall be vested with a special property therein, subject to this chapter. The word “property” as used in this chapter includes alcoholic liquor, stills and other apparatus designed for the manufacture of alcoholic liquor, receptacles and other paraphernalia used in connection with any violation of this title, and all vehicles used in connection with the unlawful transportation of alcoholic liquor. This chapter shall not apply to vehicles operated by common carriers over scheduled routes, or to such vehicles in which the sale of alcoholic liquor is licensed.

Retention of seized property; return to owner; disposition of alcoholic liquor.All property seized and delivered into the possession of the Division shall be disposed of in the following manner:(1) The enforcement officers of the Division or the peace officers who seized the property shall give written notice to the person whom they reasonably believe to be the owner of the property, and to the person from whom the property was seized, if they reasonably believe such person is not the owner, that such person may within 10 days of the date of notice and upon proof, satisfactory to the Commissioner that such property had not been used in connection with any violation of any of the provisions of this title, or of the rules of the Commissioner or both, if so used, that the use was without the knowledge, acquiescence or consent of the rightful owner, the owner’s agent, employee or servant, return said property to the rightful owner. Any dispute between the enforcement personnel of the Division and the person believed to be the rightful owner or the person from whom the property was seized, shall be resolved by a hearing before the Commissioner. The Commissioner’s decision shall be final and conclusive unless any party, having appeared before the Commissioner, appeals to the Superior Court of the State within 10 days of the date of the written decision.(2) Any property seized pursuant to this chapter which consists of alcoholic liquor and its container may, after the provisions of paragraph (1) of this section have been complied with, be offered for sale to the licensed Delaware importers of alcoholic liquor at the prevailing price paid by the importers for like brands and quality. If the alcoholic liquor is distributed in this State by more than 1 licensed importer, then the Commissioner shall offer said seized alcoholic liquor to all importers who engage in the sale of such brand of alcoholic liquor. If the seized alcoholic liquor is purchased by a licensed Delaware importer, the importer shall issue to the Commissioner a voucher showing at least the following facts:(a) The date of the purchase;(b) The purchase price of each item purchased; and(c) The quantity and nature of the item purchased.At the subsequent direction of the Commissioner, the licensed Delaware importer which purchased the liquor shall:1. If the owner of the alcoholic liquor or the person from whom the liquor was seized, if different from the person reasonably believed to be the owner, shall be found guilty of the offenses in violation of the Liquor Control Act or the rules of the Office of the Commissioner or both, issue its check payable to the Office of the Commissioner in the amount of the total purchase price shown on the voucher, which amount shall be applied by the Commissioner as provided in § 1110 of this title as proceeds of a sale authorized by order of court; or2. If the owner of the alcoholic liquor and the person from whom the liquor was seized, if different from the person reasonably believed to be the owner, shall be acquitted of the offenses alleged to have been in violation of the Liquor Control Act or the rules of the Commissioner, or both, issue its check payable to such person, or, at such person’s election, deliver alcoholic liquor of the same or similar nature and quantity described in the voucher to such person.3. The enforcement officers of the Division with the advice of other peace officers of this State and/or the Department of Justice may retain all or part of the alcoholic liquor and its containers seized for use as evidence for as long a period as they deem necessary. Thereafter it may be disposed of pursuant to this chapter.4. All other such seized property shall be disposed of as is provided in this chapter.38 Del. Laws, c. 18,\n\n§\n\n 57; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 6184;45 Del. Laws, c. 264,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\n4 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1105;58 Del. Laws, c. 248,\n\n§\n\n 4;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;72 Del.

Rule to show cause and service thereof; hearing and order of disposal.(a) Upon the filing with the Court of the Division’s report and petition in accordance with § 1107 of this title, the Court shall direct the issuance of a rule returnable on a day certain at the next succeeding term of the Court, directed to all known claimants, owners and lienors, and such rule shall be issued to and served by the sheriff of the county in which such claimant, owner or lienor shall reside or, if the Court shall so direct, may be mailed by the clerk of the peace to such claimants, owners or lienors at the addresses disclosed by the report and petition. In addition, the Court shall direct publication of a notice, in a form approved by the Court, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties where the property or any part thereof was located at the time of seizure.

Procedural provisions.(a) The Superior Court may adopt rules to govern proceedings under this chapter.(b) All proceedings under this chapter shall be in the nature of proceedings in rem for the forfeiture and disposition of property seized and not otherwise disposed of under this chapter.(c) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as depriving any owner or person holding a lien upon or conditional title to any property seized from pursuing any remedy otherwise available in any court for the recovery of said property, but no such other remedy shall be available and no other proceeding for the recovery of said property shall be brought after a petition, involving said property, has been filed in the Superior Court under the authority of § 1107 of this title, and in such case all remedies of persons claiming title to or liens upon such seized property shall be asserted and adjudicated in the cause presented by such petition in the Superior Court.(d) In any action or proceeding brought by an alleged owner, lienor or claimant of the seized property, this State, acting on behalf of the Division, shall be permitted to intervene as a party defendant and justify the seizure under the authority of this chapter, and in such case, as well as in any case arising under this chapter, the Court may by order, judgment or decree require the payment to the Division of all proper costs and expenses of seizure, holding, storage or other acts or proceedings under the authority of this chapter.(e) It shall be no objection to any report and petition filed by the Division under § 1107 of this title that it relates to and deals with the property of more than one person or property seized on more than one occasion, nor shall the Superior Court refuse to act upon any such petition because any criminal proceeding arising out of the seizure of such property remains undisposed of, has resulted in an acquittal or has been retired or nolle prossed by the Attorney General.38 Del. Laws, c. 18,\n\n§\n\n 57; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 6184;45 Del. Laws, c. 264,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\n4 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1109;72 Del. Laws, c. 486,\n\n§\n\n 13;§\n\n1110.
