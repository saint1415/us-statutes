All alcoholic liquor must be either removed from the licensed premises or placed under lock and key at all times during the social event and any time before or after the social event when persons under the age of 21 years are present on the licensed premises.(o) Any person who was convicted of a first offense under subsections (e) and (f) of this section or the same offense under any county or municipal code, ordinance, or regulation and who was under the age of 21 at the time of the offense may, upon reaching the age of 21, apply for an expungement of the record of the conviction and any indicia of arrest to the court in which the person was convicted. For violations of subsection (e) or (f) of this section, an order granting such expungement shall issue upon proof that the person has reached the age of 21, unless the person has failed to comply with the sentencing order or the person has another charge under this section, or under the same offense under any county or municipal code, ordinance, or regulation, which remains outstanding. Upon issuance of the order of expungement, the records of the conviction and any indicia of arrest shall be dealt with in accordance with the procedures specified in subchapter VII of Chapter 43 of Title 11. Nothing in this section prohibits the Family Court from expunging a record of conviction as otherwise provided by law. The application for or granting of a pardon under §§ 4361 through 4364 of Title 11 does not prohibit an expungement under this section. All sentencing orders for violations of this section by persons under the age of 21 at the time of the offense shall state that the record of the conviction may be expunged upon reaching the age of 21 and thereafter. The civil filing fee shall apply to applications for expungement plus a $100 fee payable to the State Bureau of Identification for administrative costs.(p) [Repealed.]38 Del.

The plan shall be administered by the Executive Secretary or by such other persons as shall be designated by the Commissioner. The plan shall be published as a Commissioner rule.67 Del.
