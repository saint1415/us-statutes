Duties and powers of the Commissioner.(a) The Commissioner, in accordance with the Delaware Administrative Procedures Act, shall:(1) Adopt and promulgate rules and regulations not inconsistent with this title or of any other law of the State, and all such rules and regulations shall have the force and effect of law; provided, however, that no such rule or regulation shall extend, modify or conflict with any law of this State or the reasonable implications thereof; and provided further, however, that such rules and regulations, as established by the Commissioner, shall focus primarily on public safety and the best interests of the consumer and shall not unduly restrict competition within the alcoholic beverage industry;(2) Establish by rules and regulations an effective control of the business of manufacture, sale, dispensation, distribution and importation of alcoholic liquors within and into the State, including the time, place and manner in which alcoholic liquors shall be sold and dispensed, not inconsistent with this title or with any other law of this State. However, such rules and regulations, as established by the Commissioner, shall not control or regulate:a. Recreational equipment located on the business premises of any business selling alcoholic beverages;b. Credit transactions between licensed wholesalers and licensed retailers, to the extent permitted by federal law;c. [Repealed.](3) Control the manufacture, possession, sale and delivery of alcoholic liquors in accordance with this title; and control the purchase, possession, transportation and sale of alcoholic liquors by those licensed to manufacture or to sell; provided, however, that the Commissioner’s power to control the sale of alcoholic liquors shall not be exercised in such a manner as to prevent any holder of a retail license for the sale of alcoholic liquors not for consumption on the premises where sold from giving a retail purchaser of a case or more of spirits and/or wine a discount not to exceed 10% of the total dollar sale;(4) Grant, refuse or cancel licenses required by this title for the manufacture or sale of alcoholic liquor, or other licenses required by this title in regard thereto, and to transfer any license granted;(5) On petition signed by at least 10 individuals who are residents of the neighborhood, hear complaints in regard to the appointments of, or the conduct of business in, any establishment where alcoholic liquor is licensed to be sold. Ten days’ notice of such hearings, together with a recital of the complaint, shall be sent by registered mail by the Commissioner’s office to the address of the holder of the license for the establishment and like notice shall be delivered at the establishment by affixing the notice addressed to the holder of the license to the outside of an entrance door to the establishment. The hearings shall be conducted by the Commissioner and shall be public. The Commissioner shall for the purpose of such hearings have power to issue subpoenas, compel the attendance of witnesses, administer oaths, take testimony and compel the production of pertinent books, payrolls, accounts, papers, records and documents. In case any person summoned to testify or to produce any such written or printed evidence shall refuse, without reasonable cause, to be examined or to answer a legal and pertinent question or to produce any such written or printed evidence, the Commissioner conducting the hearing may certify the fact of any such refusal to the Superior Court of the county in which such hearing is held and the court may proceed against the person so refusing as for a contempt and punish such person in the same manner as persons are punished for contempt of court;(6) Determine and publish standards for the manner in which the dining room or dining rooms of a hotel, restaurant or club shall be equipped in order to be allowed to exercise the privilege of the sale of alcoholic liquors therein; and examine the plans or premises proposed for use as a dining room and authorize their use in connection with a license to sell alcoholic liquors, but such authorization shall not prevent the requirement by the Commissioner of future alterations in accordance with published standards;(7) Compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of contracts, papers, books, accounts and other documents. Subpoenas issued shall be signed by the Commissioner and may be served by any sheriff, deputy sheriff, constable or any agent of the Division and return thereof made to the Commissioner. The Commissioner may enforce compliance with a subpoena issued pursuant to this subsection by filing a motion to compel in the Superior Court, which shall have jurisdiction over the matter. The court may award costs and attorney fees if it determines that noncompliance with a Commissioner subpoena was unjustified, intentional, or in bad faith.(8) Act, for purposes of this Title, as the competent authority in connection with other matters pertinent thereto;(9) Make an annual report submitted to the Governor and members of the General Assembly setting forth all matters of interest and all statistics concerning liquor regulation and control in the State, including:a. The number of licenses of each variety issued within the State;b. The name and address of each person licensed to manufacture or to sell alcohol, spirits, wine and beer;c. The amount of alcohol, spirits, wine and beer sold within the State;d. The number of licenses of each kind granted and the number cancelled during the year; ande. Such other data as may make a complete report to the people of this State;(10) Negotiate and, with the approval of the Governor, enter into reciprocal agreements with the duly authorized officials of other states of the United States relative to the manufacture, importation, sale and transportation of alcoholic liquors in the several states;(11) Provide such special seals, labels and wrappers as deemed necessary for protection of the public against imitations, adulterations and frauds, and prescribe the proper use of the seals, labels and wrappers; and(12) Provide such warning signs as may be required by § 903(16) of this title and distribute such signs to license holders and promulgate regulations with respect to the posting of said signs. A nominal fee may be charged by the Commissioner to cover printing, handling and distribution costs.(b) The Commissioner’s decision shall be final and conclusive unless, within 30 days after notice thereof has been mailed by the Commissioner’s office, a party to such hearing files an appeal in the office of the Commissioner. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Commissioner shall cause the Chairperson of the Appeals Commission to be advised of the pending appeal and the Chairperson shall cause the Commission to be convened with at least 20 days notice to all parties. The appeal shall be heard by the Appeals Commission, who shall, in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act, Title 29 of the Delaware Code, review the matter on the record and affirm, reverse or modify the decision of the Commissioner.(c) The Commissioner may appear before the Appeals Commission for any appeal of the Commissioner’s decision and may appeal any decision of the Appeals Commission or any decision of the Superior Court on appeal from the Appeals Commission.38 Del.
