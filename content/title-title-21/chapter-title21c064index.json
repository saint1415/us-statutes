Disclosure of odometer information by power of attorney.(a) If the transferor’s title is physically held by a lienholder, or if the transferor to whom the title was issued by the State has lost the title and the transferee obtains a duplicate title on behalf of the transferor, and if otherwise permitted by State law, the transferor may give a power of attorney to the transferee for the purpose of mileage disclosure. The power of attorney shall be on a form issued by the State to the transferee that is set forth by means of a secure printing process or other secure process, and shall contain in part A, a space for the information required to be disclosed under subsections (b)-(e) of this section. If a state permits the use of a power of attorney in the situation described in § 6411(a) of this title, the form must also contain, in part B, a space for the information required to be disclosed under § 6411 of this title, and, in part C, a space for the certification required to be made under § 6412 of this title.(b) In connection with the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle, each transferor to whom a title was issued by the State whose title is physically held by a lienholder or whose title has been lost, and who elects to give the transferee a power of attorney for the purpose of mileage disclosure, must appoint the transferee as the transferor’s attorney-in-fact for the purpose of mileage disclosure and disclose the mileage on the power of attorney form issued by the State.
