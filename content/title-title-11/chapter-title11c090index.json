Where compensation has been denied to a claimant, reopening and reinvestigation must be limited to the circumstances set forth in Superior Court Civil Rule 60.(11) Notwithstanding the provision of paragraph (10) of this section and § 9010(a)(3), (4), and (5) of this title to the contrary, the Agency may make an award for the payment of mental health counseling services under this chapter on a claim made by the victim of a crime that occurred before the victim’s eighteenth birthday so long as the occurrence of the crime is appropriately documented, and the claim is filed before the victim’s twentieth birthday. The Agency may also, upon good cause shown, permit a victim whose claim had previously been decided by the Agency to request that such claim be reopened for the purpose of making an award for the payment for mental health counseling services, and the Agency may reopen or reinvestigate the case and award such compensation, if the victim had not yet reached that victim’s eighteenth birthday by the date of the Agency’s original decision, and provided that the request for reopening is filed before the victim’s twentieth birthday. However, the foregoing limitations in this paragraph (11) regarding the victim’s twentieth birthday do not apply in cases of crimes involving sexual assault or abuse.(12) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the Agency may not limit acceptance or consideration of any applications arising from sexual assault or abuse of a child which may have otherwise been barred from consideration by a statute of limitations.(13) a.

Laws, c. 433,\n\n§\n\n3;§\n\n9010. Denial of claim; reduction.(a) The Agency shall deny payment of a claim for any of the following reasons:(1) Where the claimant was the perpetrator of the crime on which the claim is based.(2) Where the victim incurred the personal injury on which the claim is based through collusion with the perpetrator of the crime.(3) Where the victim refused to give reasonable cooperation to state or local law-enforcement agencies in their efforts to apprehend or convict the perpetrator of the crime in question.(4) Where the claim has not been filed within 1 year after the personal injury on which the claim in based, unless an extension is granted by the Agency or the Agency, in its discretion, determines that the circumstances render this requirement unreasonable.(5) Where the victim has failed to report the crime to a law-enforcement agency within 72 hours of its occurrence. This requirement is waived in any of the following circumstances:a. The crime has been reported to an appropriate governmental agency, such as child or adult protective services or the Family Court.b. The victim can provide a protection from abuse order.c. The victim has cooperated with law enforcement or an appropriate government agency in cases of crimes involving domestic violence, sexual assault or abuse.d. Where the Agency, in its discretion, determines that the circumstances of the crime or the victim render this requirement unreasonable.(6) Where the victim is injured as a result of that victim’s own suicide or attempted suicide, unless the suicide or attempted suicide is directly related to a prior criminal victimization for which compensation is eligible under this chapter.(7), (8) [Repealed.](b) In determining whether or not to make an award under this chapter, or in determining the amount of any award, the Agency may consider any circumstances it deems to be relevant, including the behavior of the victim which directly or indirectly contributed to injury or death, unless such injury or death resulted from the victim’s lawful attempt to prevent the commission of a crime or to apprehend an offender.(c) If the victim bears any share of responsibility that caused injury or death, the Agency shall reduce the amount of compensation in accordance with its assessment of the degree of such responsibility attributable to the victim. A claim may be denied or reduced if the victim of the personal injury in question, either through negligence or through wilful and unlawful conduct, substantially provoked or aggravated the incident giving rise to the injury.(d) In no event may the Agency deny any claim solely because the victim was a child victim of sexual assault or abuse, and the victim either delayed reporting the abuse or assault to authorities or the victim delayed an application for services to mitigate the effects of the impact of sexual assault or abuse.59 Del. Laws, c. 519,\n\n§\n\n 1;65 Del. Laws, c. 268,\n\n§\n\n 3;68 Del. Laws, c. 35,\n\n§\n\n 2;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;71 Del. Laws, c. 18,\n\n§§\n\n 1, 2;72 Del.

The Appeals Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Agency’s decision.(e) The claimant or the Agency, if dissatisfied by the Appeals Board’s decision concerning compensation or any conditions attached to the award of the compensation, may appeal to the Superior Court within 30 days following the date the decision of the Appeals Board is mailed to the appealing party. An appeal to Superior Court must be based on the record of the Appeals Board hearing.59 Del. Laws, c. 519,\n\n§\n\n 1;60 Del. Laws, c. 436,\n\n§§\n\n 7, 8;68 Del. Laws, c. 239,\n\n§§\n\n 1, 2;72 Del.

Attorney fees.A claimant need not be represented by an attorney before the Appeals Board, but if such person is represented the Appeals Board may award an amount for services rendered. Such fees shall not exceed $1,000 or 15% of the amount awarded, whichever sum is less, and shall be in addition to the amount of compensation awarded to the claimant. An attorney shall not charge, demand, receive or collect for services rendered in connection with any proceedings under this chapter any amount other than awarded as attorneys’ fees under this section.59 Del.

Recovery from the criminal.(a) Whenever any person is convicted of an offense and a payment of compensation is, or has been, made under this chapter for a personal injury or death resulting from the act constituting such offense, the State may institute an action against such person for the recovery of the whole or any specified part of the compensation in any Superior Court within the State, or in any other court, either state or federal, if such court has custody or control of funds of the criminal or which may be awarded to the criminal. Any amounts recovered under this section shall be deposited to the fund which finances the administration of this chapter.(b) Any payment of compensation under this chapter does not affect any right of any person to recover damages in a civil action from the person convicted of the offense giving rise to the claim for compensation.(c) Whenever any person is sentenced for an offense and compensation has been paid under this chapter to a claimant, the Agency may assert a claim for reimbursement of the Victims’ Compensation Fund as restitution from the criminal defendant. In support of the reimbursement claim, the Agency shall submit an affidavit with supporting documentation to the sentencing court, setting forth all payments made to the claimant. Restitution may be awarded to the Agency. A hearing on restitution will be held on the timely request of the defendant. Where the compensation of the claimant is continuing, and the full amount of reimbursement due has not been established by the Agency, the affidavit may so state, and the sentencing court may reserve jurisdiction over any future claim for reimbursement to the Agency. Any supplemental claim for reimbursement to the Agency must be brought within 2 years of the sentencing date, or before the expiration of a term of probation imposed on the defendant for an offense giving rise to the claim for compensation, whichever date comes first. The courts shall establish procedures for determining the amount of reimbursement due to the Victims’ Compensation Fund from offenders.59 Del. Laws, c. 519,\n\n§\n\n 1;77 Del.

Laws, c. 519,\n\n§\n\n 1;77 Del. Laws, c. 193,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n9016. Penalty assessment.(a) In addition to, and at the same time as, any fine is assessed to any criminal defendant or any child adjudicated delinquent, there must be levied an additional penalty of 18% of every fine, penalty, and forfeiture imposed and collected by the courts for crimes or offenses as defined in § 233 of this title, or $10 per offense of conviction, whichever is greater. Where multiple offenses are involved, the penalty assessment must be based on the total fine for all offenses. When a fine, penalty, or forfeiture is suspended, in whole or in part, the penalty assessment must not be suspended; provided, however, that if the penalty assessment herein imposed remains uncollected for a period in excess of 3 years, the courts may expunge the record of the assessment.(b) The penalty assessment under subsection (a) of this section must be paid to the prothonotary or clerk of court, as applicable, and transmitted to the State Treasury to be deposited in a separate account for the administration of this chapter, designated the “Victims’ Compensation Fund”.59 Del.
