In exceptional cases, a participant may be retained in the program in order to join the next following class if the additional time spent in the program is, in the opinion of the Bureau, needed to allow such person to complete the program successfully after illness or other circumstance has delayed such person’s normal progress through the program.(e) Selection for participation in a boot camp program is a privilege, and not a right. No person has the right to participate in a boot camp program.70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 244,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n6705.

The selection of boot camp participants shall be made by the Bureau from those offenders not otherwise excluded under this section. However, satisfying the statutory or regulatory qualifications for admission to the boot camp program shall not mean that an offender shall automatically be permitted to participate in the program.(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the following offenders shall not be classified or otherwise permitted to participate in the boot camp program:(1) Any person declared to be an habitual offender under § 4214 of this title;(2) Any person who is serving a sentence of Level V incarceration for a violent crime;(3) Any person who is serving a sentence for a violation of probation or parole where the crime for which the offender was originally convicted is any class A, B or C Title 11 violent felony, or any sexual offense as set forth in subpart D of subchapter II of Chapter 5 of this title or any of the following offenses: Vehicular homicide first and second degree, criminally negligent homicide, promoting prison contraband felony or stalking;(4) Any person designated by the sentencing court or the Attorney General pursuant to subsection (c) of this section as not being eligible for the boot camp program.(c) The sentencing court or the Attorney General shall have the authority to designate any person as bootcamp ineligible at the time of sentencing.

Contract; admission into the program.No offender may participate in the boot camp program unless such individual voluntarily enrolls by agreeing to be bound by a written contract with the Bureau, which contract shall clearly set forth the obligations, duties, responsibilities and expectations with which such offender must comply. A representative of the Bureau shall also explain to the offender the intended benefits of the program, and the consequences of failing the program. The time served as a boot camp participant shall begin the first day such person is physically within the camp.70 Del. Laws, c. 244,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n6708. Evaluation of program participants.Each participant shall be evaluated by members of the boot camp staff on a continual basis throughout the period of such person’s participation in the program. Such evaluation shall include the participant’s performance within the program, the likelihood of successful adjustment after release, and such other matters which the boot camp staff deems relevant or important.70 Del. Laws, c. 244,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n6709. Conduct and administration of boot camp program.(a) The program shall be a rigorous military-type program which, among other features, shall include mandatory physical training; hard labor which has a rational goal or objective; military formations, drills and courtesy; regimentation of all activities, except those which are specifically exempted by the camp commander; control which is strict, but not capricious; uniformity and cleanliness in dress and appearance; education and counseling; and drug treatment, counseling and education where appropriate.(b) The Bureau and the camp commander shall establish rules and regulations for the conduct and administration of each boot camp program. Such rules and regulations shall reflect the goals and objectives of this chapter, and shall include a system of rewards for individuals and groups based upon achievements and progress in achieving camp standards and requirements; and shall include sanctions, administered by the staff within the confines and authority of the camp, to punish those individuals whose demeanor, behavior or attitude do not comply with camp standards and requirements. The rules and regulations shall also include the supervision and the structure to be used in each program offered by the camp.(c) The camp commander and staff shall be responsible for the day-to-day functions and decisions affecting the operations of the boot camp. Each full-time employee employed inside the boot camp shall, to the extent possible, be a volunteer regardless of job description or function. All boot camp employees shall receive appropriate specialized boot camp training. Each drill instructor shall receive specialized drill instructor training, preferably military training, from an agency which specializes in such training. Boot camp employees shall receive, for the same general responsibilities, the same salaries as prison employees not employed in a boot camp. Job bidding shall not be used in the selection of the camp staff.(d) Participants may be formed into work squads by boot camp staff to perform labor-intensive projects outside the perimeters of the camp. No wages shall be paid to individual participants working outside the camp, but the camp commander may from time to time receive funds or gifts for the general use or benefit of the camp or for all participants. Work squads may be utilized to work on state, county, municipal or town projects; for disaster relief, civil or community emergencies; and for specific projects for nonprofit organizations, if the Bureau determines that the project is of direct benefit to a community or a large number of people, and not for the organization itself. No work squad is permitted to do any labor for the benefit of any individual or commercial entity. Approved projects may include, but not limited to, highway cleanup and trash removal; timber clearing on state forestry lands; preparing and stacking sandbags in the event of a flood; and beach and state park clean-up. Participants are not employees for purpose of workers’ compensation. Notwithstanding any provision of this title to contrary, any boot camp participant who is otherwise appropriately classified to the boot camp program may participate in work squads pursuant to this section.70 Del. Laws, c. 244,\n\n§\n\n 1;71 Del. Laws, c. 7,\n\n§\n\n 4;§\n\n6710. Sanctions; removal from the program.(a) A participant who is accepted into the boot camp program shall not receive any credit for time spent in the program, except for actual time served, unless such participant completes the full program. Before any participant is deemed to have completed the full boot camp program, such participant must have been graduated from the program with a written certification of successful completion.(b) A participant who fails to complete the boot camp program, who is administratively terminated from the program, or who violates any conditions of the program, shall be re-classified to serve the full unexpired term of the original sentence.(c) Upon the successful completion of the boot camp program as determined by the Department in its sole discretion, and having served at least 6 months of incarceration, the participant shall be allowed to serve the remaining part of the participant’s Level V sentence at either Level IV or Level III, in the discretion of the Department. Should a boot camp graduate violate the Level IV or Level III conditions of supervision, such person shall upon conviction of a violation of probation, be returned to Level V custody to serve the full term of the original Level V sentence, less the 6 months served in boot camp.70 Del. Laws, c. 244,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n6711. Aftercare; intensive parole supervision.A person who has successfully completed the boot camp program shall be placed under parole supervision (Level IV or Level III supervision). During this period, such person shall participate in an aftercare program which emphasizes completion of GED requirements where appropriate, drug and alcohol education and treatment; the development of job placement skills and opportunities; and the learning of successful employment habits and attitudes.70 Del. Laws, c. 244,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n6712. First offender boot camp diversion program [Repealed].71 Del. Laws, c. 174,\n\n§\n\n 4;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;71 Del. Laws, c. 484,\n\n§§\n\n 2-7;74 Del.
