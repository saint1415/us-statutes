Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1306. Public character.An electric company established by contract under this chapter shall constitute a political subdivision and body public and corporate of the State, exercising public powers, separate from the contracting municipalities. It shall have the duties, privileges, immunities, rights, liabilities and disabilities of a public body politic and corporate but shall not have taxing power.61 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1307. Purchase and sales agreements; advance payments.(a) The contracting municipalities may provide in the contract created under § 1303 of this title for payment to the company of funds for commodities to be procured and services to be rendered by the company. These municipalities and other persons and public agencies may enter into purchase agreements with the company for the purchase of electric power and energy whereby the purchaser is obligated to make payments in amounts which shall be sufficient to enable the company to meet its expenses, interest and principal payments (whether at maturity or upon sinking fund redemption) for its bonds, reasonable reserves for debt service, operation and maintenance and renewals and replacements and the requirements of any rate covenant with respect to debt service coverage contained in any resolution, trust indenture or other security instrument. Purchase agreements may contain such other terms and conditions as the company and the purchasers may determine, including provisions whereby the purchaser is obligated to pay for power irrespective of whether energy is produced or delivered to the purchaser or whether any project contemplated by any such agreement is completed, operable or operating, and notwithstanding suspension, interruption, interference, reduction or curtailment of the output of such project. Such agreements may be for a term covering the life of a project or for any other term, or for an indefinite period. The contract created under § 1303 of this title or a purchase agreement may provide that if 1 or more of the purchasers defaults in the payment of its obligations under any such purchase agreement, the remaining purchasers which also have such agreements shall be required to accept and pay for and shall be entitled proportionately to use or otherwise dispose of the power and energy to be purchased by the defaulting purchaser. For purposes of this section the phrase “purchase of electric power and energy” includes any right to capacity or interest in any project.(b) The obligations of a municipality under a purchase agreement with a company or arising out of the default by any other purchaser with respect to such an agreement shall not be construed to constitute debt of the municipality. To the extent provided in the purchase agreement, such obligations shall constitute special obligations of the municipality, payable solely from the revenues and other moneys derived by the municipality from its municipal electric utility and shall be treated as expenses of operating a municipal electric utility.(c) The contract also may provide for payments in the form of contributions to defray the cost of any purpose set forth in the contract and as advances for any such purpose subject to repayment by the company.61 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1308. Sale of excess capacity.(a) An electric company may sell or exchange excess power and energy produced or owned by it not required by any of the contracting municipalities for such consideration and for such period and upon such terms and conditions as it may determine to any other person or public agency.(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or any other statute, nothing shall prohibit a company from undertaking any project in conjunction with or owning any project jointly with any person or public agency.61 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1309. Regulation.Except as otherwise provided in §§ 201, 203A and 203B of subchapter II of Title 26, the Delaware Public Service Commission shall have no supervision or regulation over any municipal electric company formed pursuant to this chapter or over the budget, operations, rates, property, property rights, equipment, facilities or franchises of any municipal electric company formed under this chapter.61 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;68 Del. Laws, c. 299,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1310. Bond issues.(a) An electric company may issue such types of bonds as it may determine, subject only to any agreement with the holders of particular bonds, including bonds as to which the principal and interest are payable exclusively from all or a portion of the revenues from 1 or more projects, or from 1 or more revenue producing contracts made by the company with any person or public agency, or from its revenues generally, or which may be additionally secured by a pledge of any grant, subsidy or contribution from any public agency or other person, or a pledge of any income or revenues, funds or moneys of the company from any source whatsoever.(b) A company may from time to time issue its bonds in such principal amounts as the company deems necessary to provide sufficient funds to carry out any of its corporate purposes and powers, including the establishment or increase of reserve interest accrued during construction of a project and for a period not exceeding 1 year after the completion of construction of a project, and the payment of all other costs or expenses of the company incident to and necessary or convenient to carry out its corporate purposes and powers.(c) Neither the members of the board of directors of a company nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds by reason of the issuance thereof.(d) The bonds of an electric company (and such bonds shall so state on their face) shall not be a debt of the municipalities which are parties to the contract creating the company or of the State and neither the State nor any such municipality shall be liable thereon nor in any event shall such bonds be payable out of any funds or properties other than those of the company.61 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1311. Form and sale of bonds.(a) Bonds of an electric company shall be authorized by resolution of the board of directors and may be issued under such resolution or under a trust indenture or other security instrument in 1 or more series and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, bear interest at such rate or rates, be in such denomination or denominations, be in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such conversion or registration privileges, have such rank or priority, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places and be subject to such terms of redemption (with or without premium) as such resolution, trust indenture or other security instrument may provide, and without limitation by any other law limiting amounts, maturities or interest rates.(b) The bonds may be sold at public or private sale as the company may provide and at such price or prices as the company shall determine.(c) In case any of the officers whose signatures appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officers before the delivery of such obligations, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if the officers had remained in office until such delivery.61 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1312. Covenants.The company shall have power in connection with the issuance of its bonds to:(1) Covenant as to the use of any or all of its property, real or personal.(2) Redeem the bonds, to covenant for their redemption and to provide the terms and conditions thereof.(3) Covenant to charge rates, fees and charges sufficient to meet operating and maintenance expenses, renewals and replacements to a project, principal and debt service on bonds, creation and maintenance of any reserves required by a bond resolution, trust indenture or other security instrument and to provide for any margins or coverages over and above debt service on the bonds deemed desirable for the marketability of the bonds.(4) Covenant and prescribe as to events of default and terms and conditions upon which any or all of its bonds shall become or may be declared due before maturity, as to the terms and conditions upon which such declaration and its consequences may be waived and as to the consequences of default and the remedies of bondholders.(5) Covenant as to the mortgage or pledge of or the grant of a security interest in any real or personal property and all or any part of the revenues from any project or projects or any revenues producing contract or contracts made by the company with any person or public agency to secure the payment of bonds, subject to such agreements with the holders of bonds as may then exist.(6) Covenant as to the custody, collection, securing, investment and payment of any revenues, assets, moneys, funds or property with respect to which the company may have any rights or interest.(7) Covenant as to the purposes to which the proceeds from the sale of any bonds then or thereafter to be issued may be applied, and the pledge of such proceeds to secure the payment of the bonds.(8) Covenant as to limitations on the issuance of any additional bonds, the terms upon which additional bonds may be issued and secured and the refunding of outstanding bonds.(9) Covenant as to the rank or priority of any bonds with respect to any lien or security.(10) Covenant as to the procedure by which the terms of any contract with or for the benefit of the holders of bonds may be amended or abrogated, the amount of bonds, the holders of which must consent thereto, and the manner in which such consent may be given.(11) Covenant to the custody of any of its properties or investments, the safekeeping thereof, the insurance to be carried thereon and the use and disposition of insurance proceeds.(12) Covenant as to the vesting in a trustee or trustees, within or outside the State, of such properties, rights, powers and duties in trust as the company may determine.(13) Covenant as to the appointing and providing for the duties and obligations of a paying agent or paying agents or other fiduciaries within or outside the State.(14) Make all other covenants and to do any and all such acts and things as may be necessary or convenient or desirable in order to secure its bonds, or in the absolute discretion or the company tend to make the bonds more marketable; notwithstanding that such covenants, acts or things may not be enumerated herein; it being the intention hereof to give the company power to do all things in the issuance of bonds and in the provisions for security thereof which are not inconsistent with the Constitution of the State.(15) Execute all instruments necessary or convenient in the exercise of the powers herein granted or in the performance of covenants or duties, which may contain such covenants and provisions, as any purchaser of the bonds of the company may reasonably require.61 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1313. Refunding bonds.A company may issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying any of its bonds at or prior to maturity or upon acceleration or redemption. Refunding bonds may be issued at such time prior to the maturity or redemption of the refunded bonds as the company deems to be in the public interest. The refunding bonds may be issued in sufficient amounts to pay or provide the principal of the bonds being refunded, together with any redemption premium thereon, any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of payment of such bonds, the expenses of issue of the refunding bonds, the expenses of redeeming the bonds being refunded and such reserves for debt service or other capital or current expenses from the proceeds of such refunding bonds as may be required by the resolution, trust indenture or other security instruments. The issue of refunding bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the security therefor, the rights of the holders thereof and the rights, duties and obligations of the company in respect of the same shall be governed by this chapter relating to the issue of bonds other than refunding bonds insofar as the same may be applicable.61 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1314.

Such bonds are hereby made securities which may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any officer or agency of the State or any political subdivision for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations of the State or any political subdivision is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.61 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1315.

Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1316.

Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1317. Other statutes.The powers granted under this chapter do not limit the powers of municipalities to enter into intergovernmental cooperation or contracts or to establish separate legal entities under municipal charters or any other applicable law or otherwise to carry out their powers under applicable statutory provisions, nor shall such powers limit the powers reserved to municipalities by state law.

Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1318. Construction.This chapter shall be interpreted liberally to effect the purposes set forth in this chapter.61 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1319. Termination of services to a dwelling unit.(a) For purposes of this section:(1) “Cooling season” means that portion of the calendar year extending from June 1 through September 30.(2) “Employee” includes:a. Any person who is an employee of such utility authorized to accept payment for sales and services.b. The individual who is to terminate such sale or service.(3) “Heating season” means that portion of the calendar year extending from November 1 to March 31.(4) “Person” includes any individual, corporation, partnership, association, or joint-stock company.(b) (1) An electric company may not discontinue services to a dwelling unit due to nonpayment of past charges for services without at least 72 hours’ notice to the occupants of the dwelling unit of intention to terminate, except as otherwise provided by this section.(2) All electric companies must maintain a voluntary third-party notification program where a customer may designate, in writing, a third party to also receive the notice of termination of service required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The designated third party must indicate, in writing, willingness to receive such notice on behalf of the customer and may not be held liable to the electric company by reason of acceptance of third-party status.(c) (1) Unless there is a safety-related emergency, an electric company may not suspend or turn off utility services to a dwelling unit outside the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday, unless such utility provides facilities for payment and restoration of services at all times during such period. Should Thursday or Friday be a legal, state or national holiday, Wednesday must be substituted for Thursday. Should Monday be a state or national, legal holiday, the next succeeding business day must be substituted for Monday.(2) Unless there is a safety-related emergency, an electric company may not suspend or turn off utility services to a dwelling unit from December 21 of each year to January 1 of the following year.(d) In no event may such termination occur if an occupant of a dwelling unit is so ill that the termination of service will adversely affect the occupant’s health or recovery, which has been certified by a signed statement from a duly licensed physician, physician assistant, or advanced nurse practitioner, of this State or of a state with similar accreditation and received by any employee or officer of an electric company. Signed statements from a licensed physician, physician assistant, or advanced nurse practitioner, obtained pursuant to this section are effective for 120 days. Signed statements may be renewed by means of a new signed statement to prevent termination only if a customer makes a good faith effort to make payments towards the electric company. The electric company must create a dispute resolution process where disputes under this section may be reviewed. While such dispute is pending, an electric company must continue to provide utility service to the customer until the dispute is resolved. When possible, no termination under this section may occur without advance notice to any known case manager or coordinator of an occupant in an affected dwelling unit.(e) (1) An electric company may not terminate service to a dwelling unit for nonpayment of past charges on a day when the National Weather Service reports that the 8:00 a.m. temperature measured at an airport in the same county as the subject dwelling unit is 35 degrees Fahrenheit or below on the morning of the date when the service is scheduled for termination.(2) An electric company may not terminate service to a dwelling unit for nonpayment of past charges on a day when the 8:00 a.m. National Weather Service forecast contains a special weather statement or other information predicting that the heat index measured at an airport in the same county as the subject dwelling unit may equal or exceed 95 degrees Fahrenheit on the date when service is scheduled for termination.(3) When termination of service, otherwise authorized, has been deferred under paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section, notice of deferral must be given to the account holder on the date on which termination was to be effected, notifying the occupant that unless proper payment arrangements are made, service will be terminated on a day where paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section does not apply. If termination of service involves an apartment complex, trailer park, or other grouping of individual residential dwellings units to which service is provided directly or indirectly through a master meter without individual meters, the notice must be given to all occupants of each dwelling unit in the building complex in which service is proposed to be terminated.(f) (1) No electric company may terminate service to a dwelling unit during the heating or cooling season for nonpayment of a past due bill unless at least 14 calendar days prior to such termination, written notice is given to the account holder. Where the billing address is different than the location of the dwelling unit, written notice must be sent to the billing address and to the address of the dwelling unit. During the heating season, the electric company must make at least 2 documented attempts on separate days to contact the account holder by telephone, text message, or email prior to actual termination of service. One attempt must be after 5:00 p.m. During the cooling season, the electric company must make at least 1 documented attempt to contact the account holder by telephone, text message, or email prior to actual termination of service.(2) Written notice required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section must include the following information:a. The date on or after which termination of services will occur unless some satisfactory arrangement is made for the payment of the undisputed delinquent bills, which date may be no less than 14 calendar days from the mailing of written notice.b. That if there is a good faith dispute concerning the unpaid bills, termination of service will not take place pending determination of the dispute.c. That if the occupant or other payor is unable to pay the full amount of the undisputed bill, termination of service may be avoided by entering into an initial payment installment agreement with the electric company.d. A referral to charitable or governmental assistance programs, including the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.e. That if any occupant is ill and the termination of services would adversely affect the occupant’s health or recovery, the occupant or other payor may defer termination of services under subsection (d) of this section.(g) Each contracting municipality under this chapter that engages a municipal electric company must adopt regulations and ordinances to enforce the provisions of this section. The contracting municipality may assess a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation of this section. Each day of continued violation is considered a separate violation.(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an electric company may discontinue service to a dwelling unit if the utility account holder requests that utility services be discontinued and the request is voluntary.85 Del. Laws, c. 24,\n\n§\n\n2;",
