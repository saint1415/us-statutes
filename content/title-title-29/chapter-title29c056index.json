Closed plan — Amount of pensions; method of determining.For members covered by the closed plan:(1) The amount of the annual pension shall be determined by first arriving at the retiring member’s average annual compensation during the member’s highest paid 3 years comprised of 3 periods of 12 consecutive months for the member’s services as a judge or, in the event a judge becomes entitled to a pension prior to having served 3 years as a judge, then the average annual compensation during the member’s entire term for the member’s services as a judge and multiplying the average annual compensation so computed by 3% and then multiplying the product thus obtained by the total number of years of service as a judge (including fractions of years), including all years of service of the retiring judge both prior and subsequent to becoming a member of the state judiciary and both prior and subsequent to filing a declaration of acceptance of the provisions of this chapter in accordance with § 5605 of this title.(2) a. Anything to the contrary in this subsection notwithstanding, the maximum pension which a retired judge shall receive is3/4of the average annual compensation during the retired judge’s highest paid 3 years comprised of 3 periods of 12 consecutive months. Anything to the contrary in this subsection notwithstanding, the minimum pension which a retired judge shall receive is1/2of the retired judge’s average annual compensation during the judge’s highest paid 3 years comprised of 3 periods of 12 consecutive months, or, in the event a judge retires before the judge has served 3 years as a judge, then one half the average annual compensation during such retired judge’s entire term of service.b. Anything to the contrary in this section notwithstanding, the pension of a retired judge who has served more than 25 years and who retires between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1989, shall be three fourths of his or her average annual compensation to be computed based on a period equal to the retired judge’s highest paid 60 consecutive months reduced by 1 month for each month of service as a judge in excess of 25 years up to a maximum reduction of 24 months. In no case shall a retired judge’s average annual compensation as calculated under this paragraph be based on a period of less than 36 months.(3) The amount of the annual pension paid to any widow or dependent children of a deceased member of the state judiciary shall be an amount equal to2/3of the annual pension such member of the state judiciary, if the member dies while in office, would have been entitled to receive if the member had retired for disability on the day of the member’s death or shall be an amount equal to2/3of the pension of the deceased member of the state judiciary if the member died after having retired on pension. The amount of an annual pension paid to any widow or dependent children of a deceased member of the state judiciary who shall die during a period of involuntary retirement after having served at least 12 years as a judge, but before having reached age 65, shall be an amount equal to2/3of the annual pension such member of the state judiciary would have been entitled to receive if the member had lived to the age of 65. Such pensions shall be paid in equal monthly installments.29 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5604;50 Del. Laws, c. 119,\n\n§\n\n 1;50 Del. Laws, c. 533,\n\n§\n\n 2;53 Del. Laws, c. 242,\n\n§\n\n 2;56 Del.

The child has not attained age 18.b. The child has attained age 18 but not age 22 and is attending school on a full-time basis.c.

However, the actuarial reduction for any widow or widower does not apply for the period during which the widow or widower has in the widow’s or widower’s care a child who is unmarried and to whom 1 of the following applies:(1) The child has not attained age 18.(2) The child has attained age 18 but not age 22 and is attending school on a full-time basis.(3) The child has attained age 18 and has a permanent disability as the result of a disability which began before the child attained age 18.(f) A deceased member’s parent is deemed to have been dependent on the deceased member if the parent was receiving at least1/2of the parent’s support from the deceased member at the time of death.(g) A survivor’s pension begins with the month following the month in which the member dies. If payable to a widow, widower, or parent, the survivor’s pension ceases with the month in which the survivor dies. If payable to a child, the survivor’s pension ceases with the month in which the child dies or fails to meet the conditions of eligibility under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.62 Del.

The contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions for purposes of determining the amounts of federal income taxes to withhold from the member’s compensation.(b) Member contributions picked up by the employer shall be paid from the same source of funds used for the payment of compensation to a member. A deduction shall be made from each member’s compensation equal to the amount of the member’s contributions picked up by the employer. This deduction, however, shall not reduce the member’s compensation for purposes of computing benefits under the retirement system pursuant to this chapter.(c) Member contributions shall be credited to a separate account within the member’s individual account so that the amount contributed prior to the effective date for the pickup of member contributions may be distinguished from the amounts contributed on or after the effective date.(d) The contributions, although designated as employee contributions, are being paid by the employer in lieu of the contributions by the employee. The employee will not be given the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the employer to the retirement system.68 Del.
