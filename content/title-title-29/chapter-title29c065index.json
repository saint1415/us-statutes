All interest charges under this chapter shall be paid by the agency receiving the goods or services from the vendor. Such interest shall be calculated by the vendor in dollar amounts and expressly billed as such to the agency receiving goods or services from the vendor.(4) A vendor may require that interest under this subsection accrue on the unpaid balance at a rate not to exceed an annualized rate of 12 percent.(5) Agencies liable for interest payments under this subsection shall be authorized to make such payments from amounts appropriated for “contractual services” in the event an unencumbered balance shall exist in such line. In the case of agencies of public or higher education, such payment shall be made from local funds or state general funds not restricted to another purpose. The Office of Management and Budget shall establish procedures according to which interest payments under this subsection are recorded separately from other expenditures for contractual services.(6) The requirement that interest payments be made by the agency receiving goods or services be imposed upon a different agency when, in the sound discretion of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Controller General, the receiving agency demonstrates that some other agency or agencies bear greater responsibility for causing the delay which occasioned the payment of interest, in which case the responsible agency or agencies shall reimburse the receiving agency for interest charges.(e) The Secretary of Finance shall transmit to the Controller General on January 15 and July 15 of each year a report which provides the following information:(1) The name of any state agency which has, within the past 6 months, paid interest to a vendor in accordance with subsection (d) of this section;(2) The number of such interest payments made by each agency; and(3) The total amount of interest paid by each agency.(f) For public works contracts as defined by § 6902 of this title, the following shall apply:(1) The agency agent, by mutual agreement, may make progress payments on contracts of less than 90 days and shall make monthly progress payments on all other contracts as provided for in this paragraph.The agency agent shall approve or disapprove an estimate of the work submitted for payment within 7 days from the date of submission of the written application for payment. If the agency agent approves the estimate of work, such estimate shall be certified for payment. If the agency agent disapproves the estimate of work, the agency or the agency agent shall issue a specific written finding within 21 days from the submission of the applicant for payment setting forth those items in detail in the estimate of the work that are not approved for payment under the contract. The agency may withhold 150% of the amount of expenses the agency reasonably expects to incur, as approved by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in correcting the deficiency set forth in the written finding. The progress payments shall be paid on or before 21 days after the estimate of work is certified and approved. If the approval of a federal agency is required, the payment shall be deemed timely if the payment is made within 10 days of a required federal agency’s approval.(2) An agency agent, contractor or subcontractor may decline to approve and certify a billing or estimate or a portion of a billing or estimate for any of the following reasons:a. Unsatisfactory job progress;b. Defective construction work of materials not remedied;c. Disputed work or materials;d. Failure to comply with material provisions of the contract;e. Third-party claims filed or reasonable evidence that a claim will be filed;f. Failure of the contractor or subcontractor to make timely payments for labor, equipment or materials;g. Damage to the agency, contractor or subcontractor;h. Reasonable evidence that the construction cannot be completed for the unpaid balance of the construction contract; ori. Retainage of funds.(3) The retainage, as allowed by § 6962(d)(5) of this title, shall be retained by the agency as a guarantee for complete performance of the contract, to be paid to the contractor within 60 days after completion or filing notice of completion of the contract or within 30 days of a required federal agency’s final approval or certification. Retention of payments by an agency longer than 60 days after final completion and acceptance requires a specific written finding by the agency of the reasons justifying the delay in payment. Such written finding shall be furnished by the agency within 10 days after completion or filing notice to the contractor or within 10 days of the required federal agency’s final approval or certification. No agency may retain any moneys after 60 days in an amount exceeding 150% of the necessary amount to pay the expenses the agency reasonably expects to incur in order to pay or discharge the expenses determined by the agency in the finding justifying the retention of moneys.(4) If a progress payment to a contractor is delayed by more than 21 days after the date of the agency agent’s approval or the final payment to a contractor is delayed by more than 60 days after the date of the final submission, the contractor may require the payment of interest by such agency, except for periods of time during which payment is withheld pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section, beginning on the twenty-second day for progress payments and on the sixty-first day for final payment; provided, however, that:a. Presentment is deemed made when an invoice or bill is received by that agency or agency agent, provided that the invoice or bill is received in a form consistent with the State Accounting Manual and regulations issued by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of Finance. Such forms shall be included in the project’s bid documents.b. The contractor may not require interest with respect to any portion of such invoice or bill if such portion is controverted on reasonable grounds by the state agency or agency agent, provided that the agency notifies the contractor in writing, within the 21-day period for progress payments or 60 days for final payments, of the reason or reasons for controverting the invoice or bill.c. A vendor may require that interest under this subsection commence from the end of the 21-day period for progress payments or the 60-day period for final payment and continue until payment. All interest charges under this chapter shall be paid by the agency receiving the goods or services from the contractor. Such interest shall be calculated by the contractor in dollar amounts and expressly billed as such to the agency receiving goods or services from the contractor.d. A contractor may require that interest under this subsection accrue on the unpaid balance at a rate not to exceed 2% above the prime interest rate as established by the Federal Reserve.e. Agencies liable for interest payments under this subsection shall be authorized to make such payments from amounts appropriated for “contractual services” in the event an unencumbered balance shall exist in such line. In the case of agencies of public or higher education, such payment shall be made from local funds or state general funds not restricted to another purpose. The Office of Management and Budget shall establish procedures according to which interest payments under this subsection are recorded separately from other expenditures for contractual services.f. Interest payments to be made by the agency receiving goods or services may be imposed upon a different agency when, in the sound discretion of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Controller General, the receiving agency demonstrates that some other agency or agencies bear greater responsibility for causing the delay which occasioned the payment of interest, in which case the responsible agency or agencies shall reimburse the receiving agency for interest charges.(5) The agency, contractor or subcontractor may change the time periods outlined in this subsection only if:a. Prior written approval is given by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;b. The public works contract specifically provides in a clear and conspicuous manner for a later payment defined by a specific number of days after certification and approval; andc. All plan documents, including bid plans and construction plans, shall permanently display, in clear and conspicuous type, the following legend or substantially similar language:NOTICE OF EXTENDED PAYMENT PROVISIONThis contract allows the agency, contractor and subcontractor to make payment within ________ days after certification and approval of billings and estimates. Such changes shall also be indicated in a clear and conspicuous manner by contractors and subcontractors on all contracts with subcontractors and material suppliers.(6) An agency may change the time period to certify and approve a billing or estimate only if:a. Prior approval is given by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;b. The public works contract specifically provides in a clear and conspicuous manner for an extended time period within which a billing or estimate shall be certified or approved, defined by a specific number of days after the agency has received the billing or estimate; andc. All plan documents, including bid plans and construction plans, shall include, in clear and conspicuous type, the following legend or substantially similar language:NOTICE OF EXTENDED CERTIFICATION AND APPROVAL\n\nPERIOD PROVISIONThis contract allows the agency to certify and approve billings and estimate within ________ days after the billings and estimates are received from the contractor.Such changes shall also be indicated in a clear and conspicuous manner by contractors and subcontractors on all contracts with subcontractors and material suppliers.(7) The contractor shall pay the contractor’s subcontractors or material suppliers and each subcontractor shall pay the subordinate subcontractors or material supplier within 21 days of receipt of each progress payment, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, the respective amounts allowed the subordinate or subcontractor or material supplier on account of the work performed by subordinate contractors and material suppliers, to the extent of each subordinate subcontractor’s or material suppliers interest therein, except that no contract for public works may materially alter the rights of any contractor, subcontractor, subordinate subcontractor or material supplier to receive prompt and timely payment as provided under this subsection or Chapter 35 of Title 6. If a progress or final payment to a subordinate subcontractor or material supplier is delayed by more than 21 days after receipt of a progress or final payment by the contractor or subcontractor, the subordinate subcontractor or material supplier may require payment of interest by the contractor or subcontractor except for periods of time during which payment is withheld pursuant to paragraph (2) of this section, beginning on the twenty-second day, provided, however, that:a. Presentment is deemed made when an invoice or bill is received by that contractor or subcontractor, provided that the invoice or bill is received in a form consistent with the contractor’s or subcontractor requirements.b. The subcontractor or material supplier may not require interest with respect to any portion of such invoice or bill if such portion is controverted on reasonable evidence by the contractor or subcontractor, provided that the contractor or subcontractor notifies the vendor in writing within the 21-day period specified in this subsection of the reason or reasons for controverting the invoice or bill.c. A subordinate subcontractor or material supplier may require that interest under this subsection commence from the end of the 21-day period and continue until payment. All interest charges under this chapter shall be paid by the contractor or subcontractor and shall not be charged to any state agency. Such interest shall be calculated by the subordinate subcontractor or material supplier in dollar amounts and expressly billed as such to the contractor or subcontractor.d. A subordinate subcontractor or material supplier may require that interest under this subsection accrue on the unpaid balance at a rate not to exceed 2% above the prime interest rate as established by the Federal Reserve.(8) In any action or arbitration brought to collect payments or interest under this subsection, the arbitrator or court shall award damages equal to the amount that is determined by the arbitrator or court to have been wrongfully withheld. An amount shall not be deemed to have been wrongfully withheld to the extent it bears a reasonable relation to the value of any disputed amount or claim held in good faith by the agency contractor or subcontractor against whom the contractor, subcontractor of material supplier is seeking to recover payment.32 Del.

In the case of capital outlay items, the purchasing agency must demonstrate that the item is needed at the outset of the school year and that it cannot be obtained in time unless it is ordered before the close of the fiscal year prior to the year in which it is actually needed. This exception to subsection (a) of this section shall be permitted under the rules and regulations of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the State may advance, from time to time, from the General Fund to the Department of Transportation for its corporate purposes an amount reasonably expected to be reimbursed to the State by or on behalf of the Department of Transportation within 2 weeks of any such advance or by written agreement between the Secretary of Finance and the Secretary of Transportation. However, under any circumstances, the Department of Transportation shall fully reimburse all funds advanced prior to the end of the fiscal year. The Secretary of Finance is hereby authorized on behalf of the State to enter into contracts or other arrangements with the Department of Transportation to provide for such advances and reimbursement. Any such contracts or arrangements shall take into account the availability of amounts in the General Fund to meet the obligations of the State for the purposes to be met from appropriations by the General Assembly.(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the State, in order to comply with the federal Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-453, dated October 24, 1990), may advance funds from the Treasury to state agencies participating in federal assistance programs, where participation in such programs has been authorized in accordance with Chapter 76 of this title. Any advances and reimbursements made pursuant to this subsection shall be in compliance with rules and regulations of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.(e) Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, if during the course of a fiscal year, any reorganized local school district is unable to meet its obligation to fund the local share of semimonthly payroll due to either delayed receipt of property tax collectibles or previous expenditure of all available revenues, the Secretary of Finance and Director of the Office of Management and Budget, with the consultation of the Controller General, are authorized to release the unfunded payroll by covering the local liability with general funds. Such a use of general funds shall be contingent upon the reorganized local school district submitting to the Secretary of Finance a letter of agreement, signed by the district superintendent and president of the local board of education, which stipulates that the district will repay the state General Fund in full, including an amount for interest defined as the average rate of return on state investments during the period of the loan. Such repayment shall be made by means of a tax anticipation note or other means available to the district and shall be accomplished prior to releasing the next regular payroll. The provisions of this section shall not apply to obligations other than payroll. The provisions of this section may be utilized only once by each reorganized local school district during the course of any 1 fiscal year and may not be utilized for the June 30th payroll.32 Del.

Advances to agencies; regulation and security.(a) No greater sum than is necessary to meet expenses then incurred shall be drawn from the Treasury of this State for or on account of any agency. An agency which is authorized to expend any moneys on behalf of this State may, however, have money advanced to it from the State Treasury, in such sums and subject to such rules and regulations as the Secretary of Finance may determine; provided however, that the amount advanced from the General Fund to any agency at any 1 time shall not exceed $5,000.(b) To secure such an advance, the head of the agency desiring the same must certify in duplicate to the Secretary of Finance what amount is needed, that it is needed for immediate use and, as specifically as may be, the purposes for which the expenditure is required. The Secretary of Finance and the State Treasurer shall deal with such certificates in the same manner as with bills or statements of indebtedness as provided in this chapter.(c) In case of any such advance, the person or official making the certificate shall within 30 days after receipt of an advance file with the Secretary of Finance and the State Treasurer a detailed statement of the amounts expended with vouchers therefor and all advances so made shall be accounted for.32 Del.

No such sum shall be set aside for the purpose of paying state employees’ salaries or wages which do not become due and payable until the next fiscal year. Funds so set aside shall not lapse or revert at the end of such fiscal year and shall continue to be available in the fiscal year following until reverted by the Secretary of Finance.

Limitation on appropriations; advisory benchmark; Budget Stabilization Fund.(a) The following terms, as used in this section, shall be defined as follows:(1) “Appropriation” shall include automatic appropriations and continuing appropriations. An automatic appropriation shall be deemed made when any of the funds so appropriated are expended. A continuing appropriation shall be deemed made on the effective date of the first expenditure of funds so appropriated, notwithstanding the fact that the appropriation may be made continuing by virtue of a later act preventing the reversion of the appropriation.(2) “Automatic appropriation” shall mean an appropriation which specifies no fixed dollar maximum amount, that amount being determined upon the occurrence of a stated future condition.(3) “Budget Act” shall mean the Budget Appropriation Bill duly enacted according to §§ 6335 through 6338 of this title, approved by the Governor, and any amendatory legislation.(4) “Budget Reserve Account” as used in subsection (b) of this section shall mean the Budget Reserve Account as of the close of the fiscal year next preceding the year in which the appropriation, supplemental appropriation or Budget Act described in that subsection is enacted.(5) “Continuing appropriation” shall mean the unencumbered balance of any General Fund appropriation which, once established, is automatically renewed in any succeeding fiscal year without further legislative action.(6) “General Fund” shall be as defined in § 6102 of this title.(7) “Revenue anticipation bonds or notes” shall mean notes or bonds issued by the State in anticipation of the receipt by the State of taxes and revenues payable to the State and to the payment of which the State has pledged its full faith and credit, to the extent that the proceeds of such bonds or notes are deposited in the General Fund.(8) “Supplemental appropriation” shall mean an appropriation provided by a Supplementary Appropriation Bill pursuant to § 6339 of this title.(b) No appropriation, supplemental appropriation or budget act shall cause the aggregate General Fund appropriations enacted for any given fiscal year to exceed 98 percent of the estimated General Fund revenue for such fiscal year from all sources, including estimated unencumbered funds remaining at the end of the previous fiscal year. An act approved pursuant to Article VIII, § 3 of the Delaware Constitution of 1897, shall not be considered an appropriation for the purpose of this section. Estimated unencumbered funds are calculated by taking the estimated General Fund cash balance at the end of the fiscal year less estimated revenue anticipation bonds or notes, estimated encumbrances, estimated continuing appropriations and the amount of the Budget Reserve Fund as established in subsection (d) of this section at the end of said fiscal year. The amount of said revenue estimate and estimated unencumbered funds remaining shall be determined by the most recent joint resolution approved from time to time by a majority of the members elected to each House of the General Assembly and signed by the Governor.(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, any portion of the amount between 98 and 100 percent of the estimated General Fund revenue for any fiscal year as estimated in accordance with subsection (b) of this section may be appropriated in any given fiscal year in the event of emergencies involving the health, safety or welfare of the citizens of the State, such appropriations to be approved by3/5of the members elected to each House of the General Assembly.(d) There is hereby established a Budget Reserve Account within the General Fund. Within 45 days after the end of any fiscal year, the excess of any unencumbered funds remaining from the said fiscal year shall be paid by the Secretary of Finance into the Budget Reserve Account; provided, however, that no such payment will be made which would increase the total of the Budget Reserve Account to more than 5 percent of only the estimated General Fund revenues as set by subsection (b) of this section. The excess of any unencumbered funds shall be determined by subtracting from the actual unencumbered funds at the end of any fiscal year an amount which together with the latest estimated General Fund revenues is necessary to fund the ensuing fiscal year’s General Fund budget including the required estimated supplemental and automatic appropriation for said ensuing fiscal year less estimated reversions. The General Assembly by three-fifths vote of the members elected to each House may appropriate from the Budget Reserve Account such additional sums as may be necessary to fund any unanticipated deficit in any given fiscal year or to provide funds required as a result of any revenue reduction enacted by the General Assembly.(e) There is hereby established a Revenue Refund Account within the Office of the State Treasurer. Prior to depositing receipts and moneys of this State to the credit of the State Treasurer in the General Fund, the State Treasurer and the Secretary of Finance shall determine the appropriate refund amounts by major categories and pay same into the Revenue Refund Account.(1) [Repealed.](2) The State Treasurer shall prepare and issue reports periodically, upon request, as follows:a. Estimates of refund disbursements for the current fiscal year and next succeeding fiscal year by major categories for use by the Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council (or its successor entity) and/or members thereof; andb. Status of Revenue Refund Account by major categories at the close of business for each month for use by the Secretary of Finance, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Controller General.(f) No appropriation or supplemental appropriation enacted for any given fiscal year for grants-in-aid in the aggregate shall:(1) Exceed 1.2 percent of the estimated net state General Fund revenue estimated in March for such fiscal year from all sources; and(2) Cause the aggregate state General Fund appropriations enacted for any given fiscal year to exceed 98 percent of the estimated net state General Fund revenue for such fiscal year from all sources, including estimated unencumbered funds remaining at the end of the previous fiscal year.The term “estimated net state General Fund revenue” means the estimated gross state General Fund revenue less estimated revenue refunds.(g) Any appropriation for municipal street aid shall not be subject to the limitation in subsection (f) of this section.(h) After the end of each fiscal year, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall transfer the appropriation to the OPEB Fund required under § 5544(c)(2) of this title.(i) A Benchmark Appropriation is established, and is to be calculated for a fiscal year as the sum of the product of the Benchmark Index for the fiscal year and the sum of the previous fiscal year’s Budget Act and appropriations for grants-in-aid and the appropriation to the OPEB Fund, required under § 5544(c)(2) of this title, plus an amount not to exceed 1% of the previous fiscal year’s Budget Act, but only to the extent that the amount is directed as a supplemental appropriation to the bond and capital improvements act for the fiscal year.(1) The Benchmark Index must be comprised of relevant indicators of growth in the State’s economy and initially be comprised of equal weightings of the 3-year average from the current and 2 preceding fiscal years of all of the following:a. Delaware personal income growth.b. Delaware population growth, plus the growth in the implicit price deflator for state and local government purchases.(2) The Benchmark Index must be estimated and reported to the Governor and General Assembly by the Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council in December and May of each fiscal year. The report must include a statement of existing reserve funding available, including all of the following:a. The balance in the Budget Reserve Account, established under § 6 of Article VIII of the Delaware Constitution.b. The 2% set-aside, as determined by the 98% appropriation limit under § 6 of Article VIII of the Delaware Constitution.c. The balance that was allocated to the Budget Stabilization Fund that is established under subsection (k) of this section.(3) The Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council shall review the impacts of, and recommend changes to, the calculation of the Benchmark Index with a report to the Governor and General Assembly not later than October 31 of the fiscal year of a general election for the Governor of this State.(j) Except as provided under § 6335(a)(4) of this title, aggregate General Fund appropriations in the Budget Appropriation Bill required to be submitted by the Governor under § 6335(a) of this title, and supplemental appropriations for grants-in-aid, may not exceed the product of 1 plus the Benchmark Index and the sum of aggregate General Fund appropriations in the prior year’s Budget Act plus supplemental appropriations for grants-in-aid.(k) A Budget Stabilization Fund is established as a reserve account. Deposits to and appropriations and withdrawals from the Budget Stabilization Fund are authorized as follows:(1) Whenever estimated unencumbered funds are projected to be negative during the current fiscal year, the General Assembly, by joint revenue resolution approved from time to time by a majority of the members elected to each House of the General Assembly and signed by the Governor under § 6(b) of Article VIII of the Delaware Constitution or act, may subtract funds from the Budget Stabilization Fund and include the funds in a revision of estimated unencumbered funds.(2) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall transfer to the Budget Stabilization Fund the unencumbered balance at the end of each fiscal year in excess of the 2% set-aside, as determined by the most recent joint revenue resolution for the fiscal year under § 6 of Article VIII of the Delaware Constitution and this section.(3) For purposes of the Budget Appropriation Bill required under § 6335(a) of this title, whenever the 98% limit under § 6 of Article VIII of the Delaware Constitution for the subsequent fiscal year is more than the Benchmark Appropriation for the fiscal year, the excess is considered “extraordinary revenues” available for allocation only to the Budget Stabilization Fund, nonrecurring expenditures, or reducing long-term liabilities.
