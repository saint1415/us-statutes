Laws, c. 131,\n\n§\n\n 11(a), (f);65 Del. Laws, c. 119,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n7402. Issuing authority.(a) The issuing officers shall authorize the issuance of bonds, notes and revenue notes of the State by resolution adopted by the unanimous vote of the issuing officers. Each issuing officer may designate a deputy to represent the issuing officer as an issuing officer at meetings of the issuing officers with full powers to act and vote in the issuing officer’s behalf. Bonds and notes shall be issued for the purposes authorized in an authorization act. Revenue notes shall be issued for purposes authorized by this chapter. Bonds, notes and revenue notes may be issued regardless of the treatment of interest thereon for federal income tax purposes.(b) Notwithstanding any other laws to the contrary, the issuing officers shall approve, by the same vote, individual contracts or classes of contracts with firms or individuals entered into by bond issuing authorities, agencies and instrumentalities created by the State other than authorities, agencies or instrumentalities constituting institutions of higher learning.(c) Any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, the General Assembly hereby authorizes the issuance, from time to time, of general obligation bonds to refund, prior to their stated maturity, all or any portion of the outstanding general obligation bonds issued by the State and costs incidental thereto; provided, however, that the present value of the aggregate principal and interest payments of the refunding bonds must be less than the present value of the aggregate principal and interest payments on the bonds to be refunded.(1) The present value of the aggregate principal and interest payments of the refunding bonds and of the bonds to be refunded shall be discounted at the effective interest rate on the refunding bonds, calculated based on the internal rate of return.(2) Refunding bonds may be issued in a principal amount which exceeds the principal amount of the bonds to be refunded, so long as the present value of the aggregate principal and interest payments of the refunding bonds are less than the present value of the aggregate principal and interest payments on the bonds to be refunded.(3) Section 7423 of this title shall not apply to refunding bonds issued in accordance with, and under the limitations of, this subsection.(4) The issuing officers, by resolution adopted by unanimous vote and without further authorization of the General Assembly, may resolve to issue refunding bonds authorized by this subsection at any time prior to the final maturity of the bonds to be refunded. Subject to the limitations imposed by this subsection, but any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, refunding bonds may be sold at public or private sale, above or below par, with principal installments payable at such times and in such amounts and on such other terms and conditions as the issuing officers determine. Without limiting the foregoing, refunding bonds are not required to pay current interest for all or any portion of the issue, and thus may be “zero coupon” or “capital appreciation” bonds.(5) No refunding bonds may be issued unless all or a portion of the proceeds of the refunding bonds are deposited irrevocably in an account pledged to pay, and are sufficient together with any other available assets in such account to meet, the payment when due of the principal, premium (if any) and interest on the bonds to be refunded. The proceeds of the refunding bonds pledged to pay the bonds to be refunded may be invested in direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by, the United States government.(6) Any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, the issuing officers, by resolution adopted by unanimous vote, may resolve to issue refunding bonds to refund the State’s Certificates of Participation (Real Estate Acquisition Program) Series 1989 so long as the other requirements of this section are satisfied and assuming that said Certificates of Participation are treated as the bonds to be refunded.29 Del.

Such contracts shall not be deemed public works contracts as defined in 54 Del. Laws, c. 106, as amended (Chapter 69 of this title, as amended). If no such organization is able or willing to perform such inspection services on such nonprofit, at-cost basis, then the contracts for such services may be let with profit-making organizations subject to 54 Del. Laws, c. 106, as amended (Chapter 69 of this title, as amended).62 Del. Laws, c. 146,\n\n§§\n\n 6, 26;63 Del. Laws, c. 189,\n\n§\n\n 5(h);64 Del. Laws, c. 131,\n\n§§\n\n 11(f), 17(a);69 Del.

Obligations incurred to acquire a like principal amount of full faith and credit obligations issued by a local school district to the extent such local school district obligations are not in default.2.

Any obligations to the extent that the debt service with respect thereto is reasonably expected to be offset, as determined by the Secretary of Finance, by lease payments, user fees, federal grants, or other payments from some source other than the General Fund. Such payments must be used expressly for the purpose of paying such debt service.5. Obligations incurred to acquire a like principal amount of promissory notes or bonds issued by Delaware Technical and Community College and secured by the non-appropriated funds held in the Community College Infrastructure Fund, under subchapter II, Chapter 91 of Title 14, as certified to the Secretary of Finance by the Chair of the Board of Trustees, in a form approved by the Secretary of Finance, to the extent such notes or bonds of the College are not in default.(3) “Transportation Trust Fund debt obligations” means all debt obligations of the Delaware Transportation Authority, including all obligations extending beyond 1 year with respect to the lease, occupancy, or acquisition of property which are incurred in connection with debt financing transactions, such as certificates of participation, and which in any case are payable from the Transportation Trust Fund.

Any amount of tax supported obligations which are duly authorized in any fiscal year within the limits of this subsection, and then are later deauthorized, may subsequently be reauthorized without regard to the authorization limit otherwise provided by this subsection. Any amount of tax supported obligations which were duly authorized before July 1, 1991, and which are duly deauthorized after June 30, 1991, may subsequently be reauthorized without regard to the authorization limit otherwise provided by this subsection. Obligations authorized to refund other obligations of the State shall not be subject to the limits of this subsection (b).(c) No tax supported obligation of the State and no Transportation Trust Fund debt obligation of the Delaware Transportation Authority may be incurred if the aggregate maximum annual payments on all such outstanding obligations (plus certain lease obligations described below) will exceed 15% of the estimated aggregate General Fund revenue from all sources (not including unencumbered funds remaining at the end of the previous fiscal year), plus estimated Transportation Trust Fund revenue, in both cases for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which such obligation is incurred, such estimated revenue as determined by the most recent projections made by the Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council and adjusted, if appropriate, by the fiscal impact of subsequently enacted legislation as certified by the Secretary of Finance. The lease obligations referred to in the preceding sentence shall mean: (i) All obligations of the State or any agency or authority thereof which are payable from taxes, fees, permits, licenses and fines imposed or approved by the General Assembly; and (ii) all obligations of the Delaware Transportation Authority which are payable from the Transportation Trust Fund, which in either case extend beyond 1 year and are with respect to the lease, occupancy or use of property provided that such lease obligations shall not include any obligations, the lease payments with respect to which are reasonably expected to be offset (as determined by the Secretary of Finance) by lease payments, user fees, federal grants or other payments from some nonstate source. For the purposes of this subsection, the maximum annual payments on the above-described lease obligations shall be as of the most recent date available as certified by the Secretary of Finance.(d) No obligation to which the State’s full faith and credit is pledged may be incurred if the maximum annual debt service payable in any fiscal year on all such outstanding obligations will exceed the State’s cumulative cash balances for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which such obligation is incurred as estimated by the Secretary of Finance. For the purposes of this subsection, there shall not be included: (i) Obligations incurred to acquire a like principal amount of full faith and credit obligations issued by a local school district to the extent such local school district obligations are not in default; (ii) obligations guaranteed by the State except to the extent such obligations are in default; (iii) general obligation bonds of the State issued prior to January 1, 1987, for the transportation related projects as certified by the Secretary of Finance; (iv) tax or other revenue anticipation notes of the State; or (v) any obligations to the extent that the debt service with respect thereto is reasonably expected to be offset (as determined by the Secretary of Finance) by lease payments, user fees, federal grants or other payments from some source other than the General Fund.(e) There shall be attached to every bill and amendment introduced in the House of Representatives and/or in the Senate, of the General Assembly, which authorizes the incurrence of a tax supported obligation described in subsection (b) of this section, a debt statement in substantially the following form:Office of Secretary of Finance(1)(2)Multiply by 5%(3)(4)Less aggregate principal amount of previously authorized tax-supported obligations subject to debt limit(5)AVAILABLE DEBT LIMIT prior to appended legislation (3-4)(6)Less aggregate principal amount of new tax-supported obligations subject to debt limit to be authorized pursuant to appended legislation(7)REMAINING DEBT LIMIT (5-6)Secretary of FinanceDateThe Secretary of Finance shall file said debt limit statement within 10 days of said joint resolution with the Office of the Controller General and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.(f) The certification of the Secretary of Finance referred to in this section shall be in substantially the following form:Certification of Secretary of Finance RegardingCertain Revenue Supported Debt____ B.
