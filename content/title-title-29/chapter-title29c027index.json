Loan funds received from a county must be used on upgrading equipment and facilities located within that county. Loan funds must not be made available for equipment that has already been ordered or the expansion of facilities or parking that has already begun, except where such expansion is deemed necessary to provide adequate fire, rescue and emergency medical and technical emergency response services to the surrounding community by the Delaware Council on Volunteer Fire Service. The Fund shall serve as a revolving loan account and shall be eligible to receive loan repayments.

Such criteria shall include and shall give highest priority to, but shall not be limited to, consideration of the financial need of the fire, rescue, and emergency medical service companies and the surrounding community. In addition, the Council shall consider:(1) The financial assets of the volunteer fire, rescue, and emergency medical service company making the application, as well as its ability to obtain revenue, income and financial support and loans from outside sources;(2) The age and existing conditions of the volunteer fire, rescue and emergency medical service company’s apparatus, equipment, or facilities, including, but not limited to, whether such apparatus, equipment and facility are in compliance with National Fire Protection Association standards; and(3) The demographic, geographic and financial conditions of the community served by the volunteer fire, rescue and emergency medical service company making the application.(c) The Council shall be required to submit a strategic plan for accomplishing the goals to be met by the Fund and a procedure for the application process by January 31, 2003.
