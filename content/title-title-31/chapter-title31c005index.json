Carriers shall provide coverage for serious mental illnesses and drug and alcohol dependencies in all health benefit plans delivered or issued for delivery under § 505(3) of this title. Coverage for serious mental illnesses and drug and alcohol dependencies must provide:1. Inpatient coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of drug and alcohol dependencies.2. Unlimited medically necessary treatment for drug and alcohol dependencies as required by the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (29 U.S.C. § 1185a) and determined by the use of the full set of ASAM criteria, in all of the following:A. Treatment provided in residential setting.B. Intensive outpatient programs.C. Inpatient withdrawal management.b. Subject to subsections (a) and (c) through (e) of this section, no carrier may issue for delivery, or deliver, in this State any health benefit plan containing terms that place a greater financial burden on an insured for covered services provided in the diagnosis and treatment of a serious mental illness and drug and alcohol dependency than for covered services provided in the diagnosis and treatment of any other illness or disease covered by the health benefit plan. By way of example, such terms include deductibles, copays, monetary limits, coinsurance factors, limits in the numbers of visits, limits in the length of inpatient stays, durational limits or limits in the coverage of prescription medicines.(2) a. A health benefit plan under § 505(3) that provides coverage for prescription drugs must provide coverage for the treatment of serious mental illnesses and drug and alcohol dependencies that includes immediate access, without prior authorization, to a 72-hour emergency supply of prescribed medications covered under the health benefit plan for the medically necessary treatment of serious mental illnesses and drug and alcohol dependencies where an emergency medical condition exists, including a prescribed drug or medication associated with the management of opioid withdrawal or stabilization, except where otherwise prohibited by law.b. Coverage of an emergency supply of prescribed medications must include medication for opioid overdose reversal otherwise covered under the health benefit plan prescribed to a covered person.c. Coverage provided under this paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be subject to copayments, coinsurance, and annual deductibles that are consistent with those imposed on other benefits within the health benefit plan; provided, however, a health benefit plan must not impose an additional copayment or coinsurance on a covered person who received an emergency supply of the same medication in the same 30-day period in which the emergency supply of medication was dispensed.d. This paragraph (b)(2) does not preclude the imposition of a copayment or coinsurance on the initial emergency supply of medication in an amount that is less than the copayment or coinsurance otherwise applicable to a 30-day supply of such medication, provided that the total sum of copayments or coinsurance for an entire 30-day supply of the medication does not exceed the copayment or coinsurance otherwise applicable to a 30-day supply of such medication.(c)Eligibility for coverage. —(1) Subject to the limitations set forth in subsection (d) of this section, a health benefit plan may condition coverage of services provided in the diagnosis and treatment of a serious mental illness and drug and alcohol dependency on the following further requirements that the service or services:a.

Must be medically necessary.c. Must be covered services subject to any administrative requirements of the health benefit plan.(2) A health benefit plan may further condition coverage of services provided in the diagnosis and treatment of a serious mental illness and drug and alcohol dependency in the same manner and to the same extent as coverage for all other illnesses and diseases is conditioned. Such conditions may include, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, precertification and referral requirements.(d)Benefit management. —(1) A carrier may, directly or by contract with another qualified entity, manage the benefit prescribed by subsection (b) of this section in order to limit coverage of services provided in the diagnosis and treatment of a serious mental illness and drug and alcohol dependency to those services that are deemed medically necessary as follows:a. The management of benefits for serious mental illnesses and drug and alcohol dependencies may be by methods used for the management of benefits provided for other medical conditions, or may be by management methods unique to mental health benefits. Such may include, by way of example and not limitation, preadmission screening, prior authorization of services, utilization review, and the development and monitoring of treatment plans.b. A carrier may not impose precertification, prior authorization, preadmission screening, or referral requirements for the diagnosis and medically necessary treatment, including in-patient treatment, of drug and alcohol dependencies.c. The benefit prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section may not be subject to concurrent utilization review during the first 14 days of any inpatient admission to a facility approved by a nationally recognized healthcare accrediting organization or the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health, 30 days of intensive outpatient program treatment, or 5 days of inpatient withdrawal management, provided that the facility notifies the carrier of both the admission and the initial treatment plan within 48 hours of the admission. The facility shall perform daily clinical review of the patient, including the periodic consultation with the carrier to ensure that the facility is using the evidence-based and peer reviewed clinical review tool utilized by the carrier which is designated by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (“ASAM”) or, if applicable, any state-specific ASAM criteria, and appropriate to the age of the patient, to ensure that the inpatient treatment is medically necessary for the patient.d. Any utilization review of treatment provided under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may include a review of all services provided during such inpatient treatment, including all services provided during the first 14 days of such inpatient treatment, 30 days of intensive outpatient program treatment, or 5 days of inpatient withdrawal management; provided, however, the carrier may only deny coverage for any portion of the initial 14-day inpatient treatment on the basis that such treatment was not medically necessary if such inpatient treatment was contrary to the evidence-based and peer reviewed clinical review tool utilized by the carrier which is designated by ASAM or, if applicable, any state-specific ASAM criteria.e. A covered person does not have any financial obligation to the facility for any treatment under paragraph (b)(1) of this section other than any copayment, coinsurance, or deductible otherwise required under the health benefit plan.(2) This section shall not be interpreted to require a carrier to employ the same benefit management procedures for serious mental illnesses and drug and alcohol dependencies that are employed for the management of other illnesses or diseases covered by the health benefit plan or to require parity or equivalence in the rate, or dollar value of, claims denied.(e)Out of network services. —Where a health benefit plan provides benefits for the diagnosis and treatment of serious mental illnesses and drug and alcohol dependencies within a network of providers and where a beneficiary of the health benefit plan obtains services consisting of diagnosis and treatment of a serious mental illness and drug and alcohol dependency outside of the network of providers, this section shall not apply. The health benefit plan may contain terms and conditions applicable to out of network services without reference to this section.(f)Reporting requirements. —Each carrier must submit a report to the Department on or before July 1, 2019, and any year thereafter during which the carrier makes significant changes to how it designs and applies its medical management protocols; the report must contain the following information:(1) A description of the process used to develop or select the medical necessity criteria for mental illness and drug and alcohol dependencies benefits and the process used to develop or select the medical necessity criteria for medical and surgical benefits.(2) As requested by the Department, identification of select nonquantitative treatment limitations (NQTLs) that are applied to mental illness and drug and alcohol dependencies benefits and medical and surgical benefits within each classification of benefits; there may be no separate NQTLs that apply to mental illness and drug and alcohol dependencies benefits that do not also apply to medical and surgical benefits within any classification of benefits.(3) The results of an analysis that demonstrates that for the medical necessity criteria described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and for each NQTL identified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, as written and in operation, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in applying the medical necessity criteria and each NQTL to mental illness and drug and alcohol dependencies benefits within each classification of benefits are comparable to, and are applied no more stringently than, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in applying the medical necessity criteria and each NQTL to medical and surgical benefits within the corresponding classification of benefits; at a minimum, the results of the analysis shall:a. Identify the factors used to determine that an NQTL will apply to a benefit, including factors that were considered but rejected.b. Identify and define the specific evidentiary standards used to define the factors and any other evidence relied upon in designing each NQTL.c. Provide the comparative analyses, including the results of the analyses, performed to determine that the processes and strategies used to design each NQTL, as written, for mental illness and drug and alcohol dependencies benefits are comparable to, and are applied no more stringently than, the processes and strategies used to design each NQTL, as written, for medical and surgical benefits.d. Provide the comparative analyses, including the results of the analyses, performed to determine that the processes and strategies used to apply each NQTL, in operation, for mental illness and drug and alcohol dependencies benefits are comparable to, and applied no more stringently than, the processes or strategies used to apply each NQTL, in operation, for medical and surgical benefits.e. Disclose the specific findings and conclusions reached by the carrier that the results of the analyses above indicate that the carrier is in compliance with this section and the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 [P.L. 104-204] and its implementing regulations, which includes 42 C.F.R. Part 438, Subpart K, and any other related federal regulations found in the Code of Federal Regulations.(4) Any information submitted to the Department of Health and Social Services by a carrier that is considered proprietary by the carrier shall not be made public record.(5) The Department of Health and Social Services shall retain the authority to enforce the provisions of this section.
