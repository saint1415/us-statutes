Declaration of necessity.It is found and declared that there exist in localities throughout the State slum and blighted areas (as defined in § 4501 of this title) which constitute a serious and growing menace, injurious and inimical to the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the State; that the existence of such areas contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, necessitating excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime prevention, correction, prosecution, punishment and the treatment of juvenile delinquency and for the maintenance of adequate police, fire and accident protection and other public services and facilities, constitutes an economic and social liability, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of communities and retards the provision of housing accommodations; that this menace is beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory process in the exercise of the police power and cannot be dealt with effectively by the ordinary operations of private enterprise without the aids provided in this chapter; that the elimination of slum conditions or conditions of blight, the acquisition and preparation of land in or necessary to the development of slum or blighted areas and its sale or lease for development or redevelopment in accordance with general plans and redevelopment plans of communities and any assistance which may be given by any state public body in connection therewith are public uses and purposes for which public money may be expended and private property acquired; and that the necessity in the public interest for the provisions enacted in this chapter is declared as a matter of legislative determination.It is found and declared that:(1) There exists in communities of this State blighted and deteriorated areas which constitute a serious and growing menace, injurious to the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the State, and the findings and declarations made in this section prior to December 27, 1965, are affirmed and restated,(2) Certain blighted, deteriorated, or deteriorating areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition and clearance, as provided in this chapter, since the prevailing condition of decay may make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or rehabilitation, but other areas or portions thereof may, through the means provided in this chapter, be susceptible of conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner that the conditions and evils enumerated in this section may be eliminated, remedied or prevented, and to the extent feasible, salvable blighted, deteriorated, or deteriorating areas should be conserved and rehabilitated through voluntary action and the regulatory process, and(3) All powers conferred by this chapter, as amended, are for public uses and purposes for which public money may be expended and such other powers exercised, and the necessity in the public interest for the provisions of this chapter is declared as a matter of legislative determination.A municipality or community to the greatest extent it determines to be feasible in carrying out the provisions of this chapter shall afford maximum opportunity, consistent with the sound needs of the municipality or community as a whole, to the conservation or rehabilitation or redevelopment of areas by private enterprise.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 2; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4502;55 Del. Laws, c. 292,\n\n§\n\n 7;§\n\n4503. Creation of slum clearance and redevelopment authority.There is created in each community (as defined in § 4501 of this title) a public body corporate and politic, to be known as the “slum clearance and redevelopment authority” of the community. Such authority shall not transact any business or exercise its powers under this chapter until or unless the governing body shall approve (by resolution, as provided in this chapter) the exercise in such community of the powers, functions and duties of an authority under this chapter. If it deems such action to be in the public interest, the governing body may, instead of such resolution, adopt a resolution approving the exercise of such powers, functions and duties by the community itself or by a housing authority, and in such event, the community or housing authority, as the case may be, shall be vested with all the powers, functions, rights, duties and privileges of a slum clearance and redevelopment authority under this chapter.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 4; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4503;§\n\n4504. Resolutions.The governing body of a community shall not adopt a resolution pursuant to § 4503 of this title unless it finds that:(1) One or more slum or blighted areas (as defined in § 4501 of this title) exist in such community; and(2) The redevelopment of such area or areas is necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, morals or welfare of the residents of such community.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 4; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4504;§\n\n4505. Regional slum clearance and redevelopment authority.If the governing body of each of 2 or more communities declares, by resolution, that there is a need for 1 slum clearance and redevelopment authority to be created for all of such communities, and has made the findings required by § 4504 of this title, a public body, corporate and politic, to be known as a regional slum clearance and redevelopment authority (herein referred to as “regional authority” or “authority”) shall thereupon exist for all of such communities and may exercise the powers and other functions of an authority under this chapter in such communities.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 4; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4505;§\n\n4506. Area of operation of regional authority.The area of operation of a regional authority shall be increased from time to time to include 1 or more additional communities if the governing body of each of such additional communities adopts the resolution described in § 4505 of this title and makes the findings required by § 4504 of this title, and the commissioners of the regional authority consent to the inclusion within its area of operation of such additional communities.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 4; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4506;§\n\n4507. Board of commissioners; number; tenure of office; vacancies.When the governing body of a municipality adopts a resolution as provided in this chapter, it shall promptly notify the mayor of such adoption. If the resolution adopted is one approving the exercise of powers hereunder by a slum clearance and redevelopment authority, the mayor, by and with the advice and consent of the governing body, shall appoint a board of commissioners of the authority created for such municipality which shall consist of 5 commissioners, and when the governing body of a county adopts such a resolution, the body shall appoint a board of commissioners of the authority created for such county which shall consist of 5 commissioners. The commissioners who are first appointed pursuant to this chapter shall be designated to serve for terms of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively, from the date of their appointment, but thereafter commissioners shall be appointed as aforesaid for a term of office of 5 years, except that all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 4; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4507;§\n\n4508. Appointment of commissioners for each additional community; tenure.If a regional authority is created as provided in this chapter, 1 person shall be appointed as a commissioner of such authority for each community for which such authority is created. When the area of operation of a regional authority is increased to include an additional community or communities as provided in this chapter, 1 additional person shall be appointed as a commissioner of such authority for each such additional community. Each such commissioner appointed for a municipality shall be appointed by the mayor thereof, by and with the advice and consent of the governing body, and each such commissioner appointed for a county shall be appointed by the governing body thereof. The first appointment of commissioners of a regional authority may be made at or after the time of the adoption of the resolution declaring the need for such authority or declaring the need for the inclusion of such community in the area of operation of such authority. The commissioners of a regional authority and their successors shall be appointed as aforesaid for terms of 5 years except that all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired terms.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 4; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4508;§\n\n4509. Odd and even number of communities; tenure; certificate of appointment as evidence.If the area of operation of a regional authority consists at any time of an even number of communities, the commissioners of the regional authority already appointed in the manner described in this chapter shall appoint 1 additional commissioner whose term of office shall be as provided for a commissioner of a regional authority, except that such term shall end at any earlier time that the area of operation of the regional authority shall be changed to consist of an odd number of communities. The commissioners of such authority already appointed in the manner described in this chapter shall likewise appoint each person to succeed such additional commissioner. The term of office of such person begins during the terms of office of the commissioners appointing such person. A certificate of the appointment of any such additional commissioner of such regional authority shall be filed with the other records of the regional authority and shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such additional commissioner.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 4; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4509;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4510.

Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 4; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4510;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4511. Power of authority; quorum; meetings; qualifications for appointment as commissioner.The powers under this chapter vested in each slum clearance and redevelopment authority shall be exercised by the board of commissioners thereof. A majority of the commissioners shall constitute a quorum of such board for the purpose of conducting business and exercising the powers of the authority and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by the board upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws of the authority shall require a larger number. Meetings of the board of an authority may be held anywhere within the perimeter boundaries of the area of operation of the authority. Any persons may be appointed as commissioners of the authority if they reside within such area and are otherwise eligible for such appointments under this chapter.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 4; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4511;§\n\n4512. Officers; employees; duties and compensation; legal services.The commissioners of an authority shall elect a chairperson and vice-chairperson from among the commissioners. An authority may employ an executive director, technical experts and such other officers, agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and shall determine their qualifications, duties and compensation. For such legal services as it may require, an authority may, with the approval of the governing body, call upon the chief law officer of the communities within its area of operation or it may employ its own counsel and legal staff. An authority may delegate to 1 or more of its agents or employees such powers or duties as it may deem proper.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 4; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4512;70 Del.

In the event of the removal of any commissioner, a record of the proceedings, together with the charges and findings thereon, shall be filed in the office of the municipal or county clerk, as the case may be.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 4; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4513;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4514. Actions or proceedings; proof of adoption of resolutions as evidence.In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of or bonds issued by an authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers under this chapter upon proof of the adoption of the appropriate resolution prescribed in § 4503 or § 4505 of this title. Each such resolution shall be deemed sufficient if it authorizes the exercise of powers under this chapter by the authority or other public body and finds in substantially the terms provided in § 4504 of this title (no further detail being necessary) that the conditions therein enumerated exist. A copy of such resolution duly certified by the municipal or county clerk, as the case may be, shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding.48 Del.

Where the acquisition is not voluntary, such commissioner or employee shall immediately disclose such interest in writing to the authority and such disclosure shall be entered upon the minutes of the authority. If any commissioner or employee of an authority presently owns or controls or owned or controlled within the preceding 2 years an interest, direct or indirect, in any property included or planned by the authority to be included in any redevelopment project, the commissioner or employee immediately shall disclose such interest in writing to the authority and such disclosure shall be entered upon the minutes of the authority.

Approval of plan; required findings.(a) Following the hearing required by § 4524 of this title, the local governing body may approve an urban renewal project and the plan therefor if it finds that:(1) A feasible method exists for the location of families who will be displaced from the urban renewal area, in decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations within their means and without undue hardship to such families;(2) The urban renewal plan conforms to the general plan of the municipality or community as a whole;(3) The urban renewal plan gives due consideration to the provision of adequate park and recreational areas and facilities that may be desirable for neighborhood improvement, with special consideration for the health, safety and welfare of children residing in the general vicinity of the site covered by the plan; and(4) The urban renewal plan will afford maximum opportunity, consistent with the sound needs of the municipality or community as a whole, for the rehabilitation or redevelopment of the urban renewal area by private enterprise.(b) If the urban renewal area consists of an area of open land to be acquired by the municipality or community, such area shall not be so acquired unless:(1) If it is to be developed for residential uses, the local governing body shall determine that a shortage of housing of sound standards and design which is decent, safe and sanitary exists in the municipality or community, that the need for housing accommodations has been or will be increased as a result of the clearance of slums in other areas, that the conditions of blight in the area and the shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing cause or contribute to an increase in and spread of disease and crime, and constitute a menace to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare, and that the acquisition of the area for residential uses is an integral part of and essential to the program of the municipality or community; or(2) If the area is to be developed for nonresidential uses, the local governing body shall determine that such nonresidential uses are necessary and appropriate to facilitate the proper growth and development of the community in accordance with sound planning standards and local community objectives, which acquisition may require the exercise of governmental action as provided in this chapter, because of defective or unusual conditions of title, diversity of ownership, tax delinquency, improper subdivisions, outmoded street patterns, deterioration of site, economic disuse, unsuitable topography or faulty lot layouts, the need for the correlation of the area with other areas of a municipality or community, by streets and modern traffic requirements, or any combination of such factors or other conditions which retard development of the area.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 6; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4525;55 Del. Laws, c. 292,\n\n§\n\n 8;§\n\n4526. Modification of plan; notice; objections.An urban renewal plan which has not been approved by the governing body when recommended by the authority may again be recommended to it with any modifications deemed advisable. A redevelopment plan may be modified at any time by the authority; provided, that, if modified after the lease or sale of real property in the urban renewal project area, the modification must be consented to by the redeveloper or redevelopers, or any successor or successors who acquired 75% of the land in the project area and whose interest may be affected by the proposed modification.The notice of the proposed modification shall be sent by certified mail to the last known address of the redeveloper or redevelopers of the real property, or any successor or successors, who shall have 30 days from the date of the notice to state objections to the modification. These objections will be submitted to the governing body at the time of the hearing. If no objections are made within the 30 days from the date of the notice, then the authority may recommend the plan and state to the governing body that there were no objections.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 6; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4526;57 Del. Laws, c. 565,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;84 Del. Laws, c. 42,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n4527. Disposal of property in redevelopment project.(a) An authority may sell, lease, exchange or otherwise transfer real property or any interest therein in a redevelopment project area to any redeveloper for residential, recreational, commercial, industrial or other uses or for public use in accordance with the redevelopment plan, subject to such covenants, conditions and restrictions as it may deem to be in the public interest or to carry out the purposes of this chapter. Such sale, lease, exchange or other transfer, and any agreement relating thereto, may be made only after, or subject to, the approval of the redevelopment plan by the governing body of the community. Such real property shall be sold, leased or transferred at its fair value for uses in accordance with the redevelopment plan, notwithstanding such value may be less than the cost of acquiring and preparing such property for redevelopment. In determining the fair value of real property for uses in accordance with the redevelopment plan, an authority shall take into account and give consideration to the uses and purposes required by such plan, the restrictions upon, and the covenants, conditions and obligations assumed by the redeveloper of, such property, the objectives of the redevelopment plan for the prevention of the recurrence of slum or blighted areas and such other matters as the authority shall specify as being appropriate. In fixing rentals and selling prices, an authority shall give consideration to appraisals of the property for such uses made by land experts employed by the authority.(b) An authority shall, by public notice by publication once each week for 2 consecutive weeks in a newspaper having a general circulation in the community, prior to the consideration of any redevelopment contract proposal, invite proposals from, and make available all pertinent information to private redevelopers or any persons interested in undertaking the redevelopment of an area, or any part thereof, which the governing body has declared to be in need of redevelopment. Such notice shall identify the area and shall state that such further information as is available may be obtained at the office of the authority. The authority shall consider all redevelopment proposals and the financial and legal ability of the prospective redevelopers to carry out their proposals and may negotiate with any redevelopers for proposals for the purchase or lease of any real property in the redevelopment project area. The authority may accept such redevelopment contract proposal as it deems to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter; provided, that the authority has, not less than 30 days prior thereto, notified the governing body in writing of its intention to accept such redevelopment contract proposal. Thereafter, the authority may execute such redevelopment contract in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section and deliver deeds, leases and other instruments and take all steps necessary to effectuate such redevelopment contract. At its discretion, the authority may, without regard to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, dispose of real property in a redevelopment project area to private redevelopers for redevelopment under such reasonable competitive bidding procedures as it shall prescribe, subject to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. Further the authority may, at its discretion, dispose of real property in a redevelopment project area to public, quasi-public, charitable and religious corporations by negotiation without resorting to the provisions of this subsection.(c) An authority may temporarily operate and maintain real property in a redevelopment project area pending the disposition of the property for redevelopment without regard to the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, for such uses and purposes as may be deemed desirable even though not in conformity with the redevelopment plan.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 7; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4527;57 Del. Laws, c. 564,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4528. Eminent domain.An authority may acquire by the exercise of the power of eminent domain any real property which it may deem necessary for a redevelopment project or for its purposes under this chapter after the adoption by it of a resolution declaring that the acquisition of the real property described therein is necessary for such purposes. An authority may exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner prescribed by Chapter 61 of Title 10. Property already devoted to a public use may be acquired in like manner. No real property belonging to the municipality, the county or the State may be acquired without its consent. When an authority has found and determined by resolution that certain real property described therein is necessary for a redevelopment project or for its purposes under this chapter, the resolution shall be conclusive evidence that the acquisition of such real property is necessary for the purposes described therein.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 8; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4528;§\n\n4529. Acquisition and development of undeveloped vacant land.Upon a determination by resolution of the governing body of the community in which such land is located that the acquisition and development of undeveloped vacant land, not within a slum or blighted area, is essential to the proper clearance or redevelopment of slum or blighted areas or a necessary part of the general slum clearance program of the community, the acquisition, planning, preparation for development or disposal of such land shall constitute a redevelopment project which may be undertaken by the authority in the manner provided in this chapter. The determination by the governing body shall be in lieu of the declaration required by § 4518 of this title, but shall not be made until the governing body finds that there is a shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing in the community, that such undeveloped vacant land will be developed for predominantly residential uses, and that the provision of dwelling accommodations on such undeveloped vacant land is necessary to accomplish the relocation, in decent, safe and sanitary housing in the community of families to be displaced from slum or blighted areas which are to be redeveloped. In the undertaking of redevelopment projects on a regional or unified metropolitan basis, involving the acquisition and development of undeveloped vacant land in 1 community as an adjunct to the redevelopment of slum or blighted areas in another community, each determination or finding required in this section shall be made by the governing body of the community with respect to which the determination or finding relates.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 9; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4529;§\n\n4530. Issuance of bonds.(a) An authority may issue bonds from time to time at its discretion for any of its corporate purposes including the payment of principal and interest upon any advances for surveys and plans for redevelopment projects. An authority may also issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying or retiring or in exchange for bonds previously issued by it. An authority may issue such types of bonds as it may determine, including (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) bonds on which the principal and interest are payable:(1) Exclusively from the income, proceeds and revenues of the redevelopment project financed with the proceeds of such bonds; or(2) Exclusively from the income, proceeds and revenues of any of its redevelopment projects whether or not they are financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such bonds.Any such bonds may be additionally secured by a pledge of any loan, grant or contributions, or parts thereof, from the federal government or other source, or a mortgage on any redevelopment project or projects of the authority.(b) Neither the commissioners of an authority nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. The bonds and other obligations of the authority (and such bonds and obligations shall so state on their face) shall not be a debt of the municipality, the county or the State, nor in any event shall such bonds or obligations be payable out of any funds or properties other than those of such authority acquired for the purposes of this chapter. The bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction. Bonds of an authority are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and to be public instrumentalities and, together with interest thereon and income therefrom, shall be exempt from all taxes.(c) Bonds of an authority shall be authorized by its resolution and may be issued in 1 or more series and shall bear such date or dates, be payable upon demand or mature at such time or times, bear interest at such rate or rates, not exceeding 6% per annum, be in such denomination or denominations, be in such form either coupon or registered, carry such conversion or registration privileges, have such rank or priority, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places and be subject to such terms of redemption (with or without premium) as such resolution, its trust indenture or mortgage may provide.(d) The bonds shall be sold at not less than par at public sale held after notice published once at least 10 days prior to such sale in a legal newspaper having a general circulation in the area of operation and in such other medium of publication as the authority may determine. Such bonds may be sold to the federal government at private sale at not less than par, and, in the event less than all of the bonds authorized in connection with any project or projects are sold to the federal government, the balance of such bonds may be sold at private sale at not less than par at an interest cost to the authority of not to exceed the interest cost to the authority of the portion of the bonds sold to the federal government.(e) In case any of the commissioners or officers of the authority whose signatures appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such commissioners or officers before the delivery of such bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such commissioners or officers had remained in office until such delivery. Any provision of any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds issued pursuant to this chapter shall be fully negotiable.(f) In any suit, action or proceedings involving the validity or enforceability of any bond of an authority or the security therefor, any such bond reciting in substance that it has been issued by the authority to aid in financing a redevelopment project, as defined in § 4501 of this title, shall be conclusively deemed to have been issued for such purpose and such project shall be conclusively deemed to have been planned, located and carried out in accordance with this chapter.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 10; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4530;§\n\n4531. Powers in connection with issuance of bonds.(a) In connection with the issuance of bonds or the incurring of obligations under leases and in order to secure the payment of such bonds or obligations, an authority, in addition to its other powers, may:(1) Pledge all or any part of its gross or net rents, fees or revenues to which its right then exists or may thereafter come into existence;(2) Mortgage all or any part of its real or personal property, then owned or thereafter acquired;(3) Covenant against pledging all or any part of its rents, fees and revenues, or against mortgaging all or any part of its real or personal property, to which its right or title then exists or any thereafter come into existence or against permitting or suffering any lien on such revenues or property, covenant with respect to limitations on its right to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any redevelopment project or any part thereof, and covenant as to what other, or additional debts or obligations may be incurred by it;(4) Covenant as to the bonds to be issued and as to the issuance of such bonds in escrow or otherwise, and as to the use and disposition of the proceeds thereof, provide for the replacement of lost, destroyed or mutilated bonds, covenant against extending the time for the payment of its bonds or interest thereon, and covenant for the redemption of the bonds and provide the terms and conditions thereof;(5) Covenant (subject to the limitations contained in this chapter) as to the amount of revenues to be raised each year or other period of time by rents, fees and other revenues, and as to the use and disposition to be made thereof, create or authorize the creation of special funds for moneys held for operating costs, debt service, reserves or other purposes and covenant as to the use and disposition of the moneys held in such funds;(6) Prescribe the procedure, if any, by which the terms of any contract with bondholders may be amended or abrogated, the amount of bonds the holders of which must consent thereto and the manner in which such consent may be given;(7) Covenant as to the use, maintenance and replacement of any or all of its real or personal property, the insurance to be carried thereon and the use and disposition of insurance moneys, and warrant its title to such property;(8) Covenant as to the rights, liabilities, powers and duties arising upon the breach by it of any covenants, condition or obligation, and covenant and prescribe as to events of default and terms and conditions upon which any or all of its bonds or obligations shall become or may be declared due before maturity and as to the terms and conditions upon which such declaration and its consequences may be waived;(9) Vest in any obligees of the authority the right to enforce the payment of the bonds or any covenants securing or relating to the bonds, vest in any obligee or obligees holding a specified amount in bonds the right, in the event of a default by the authority, take possession of and use, operate and manage any redevelopment project or any part thereof, title to which is in the authority, or any funds connected therewith, and collect the rents and revenues arising therefrom and dispose of such moneys in accordance with the agreement of the authority with such obligees, provide for the powers and duties of such obligees and limit the liabilities thereof, and provide the terms and conditions upon which such obligees may enforce any covenant or rights securing or relating to the bonds; and(10) Exercise all or any part or combination of the powers herein granted, make such covenants (other than and in addition to the covenants herein expressly authorized) and do any and all such acts and things as may be necessary or convenient or desirable in order to secure its bonds, or, at the absolute discretion of the authority, as will tend to make the bonds more marketable notwithstanding that such covenants, acts or things may not be enumerated herein.(b) An authority may by its resolution, trust indenture, mortgage, lease or other contract confer upon any obligee holding or representing a specified amount in bonds, the right (in addition to all rights that may otherwise be conferred), upon the happening of an event of default as defined in such resolution or instruments, by suit, action or proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction:(1) To cause possession of any redevelopment project or any part thereof, title to which is in the authority, to be surrendered to any such obligee;(2) To obtain the appointment of a receiver of any redevelopment project of such authority or any part thereof, title to which is in the authority and of the rents and profits therefrom. If such receiver be appointed, the receiver may enter and take possession of, carry out, operate and maintain such project or any part thereof and collect and receive all fees, rents, revenues or other charges thereafter arising therefrom and shall keep such moneys in a separate account or accounts and apply the same in accordance with the obligations of such authority as the court shall direct; and(3) To require such authority and the commissioners, officers, agents and employees thereof to account as if it and they were the trustees of an express trust.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 11; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4531;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4532. Rights of obligees.An obligee of an authority may, in addition to all other rights which may be conferred on such obligee, subject only to any contractual restrictions binding upon such obligee:(1) By mandamus, suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity compel such authority and the commissioners, officers, agents or employees thereof to perform each and every term, provision and covenant contained in any contract of such authority with or for the benefit of such obligee and require the carrying out of any or all such covenants and agreements of such authority and the fulfillment of all duties imposed upon such authority by this chapter;(2) By suit, action or proceeding in equity, enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful or the violation of any of the rights of such obligee of such authority.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 12; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4532;§\n\n4533. Bonds as legal investments.All public officers, municipal corporations, political subdivisions and public bodies, all banks, trust companies, bankers, savings banks and institutions, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, investment companies and other persons carrying on a banking business, all insurance companies, insurance associations and other persons carrying on an insurance business, and all executors, administrators, curators, trustees and other fiduciaries may legally invest any sinking funds, moneys or other funds belonging to them or within their control in any bonds or other obligations issued by an authority pursuant to this chapter or by any public housing or redevelopment authority or commission or agency or any other public body in the United States for redevelopment purposes, when such bonds and other obligations are secured by an agreement between the issuing agency and the federal government in which the issuing agency agrees to borrow from the federal government and the federal government agrees to lend to the issuing agency, prior to the maturity of such bonds or other obligations, moneys in an amount which (together with any other moneys irrevocably committed to the payment of interest on such bonds or other obligations) will suffice to pay the principal of such bonds or other obligations with interest to maturity thereon, which moneys under the terms of such agreement are required to be used for the purpose of paying the principal of and the interest on such bonds or other obligations at their maturity and such bonds and other obligations shall be authorized security for all public deposits.

Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 13; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4533;§\n\n4534. Conveyance to federal government on default.In any contract for financial assistance with the federal government the authority may obligate itself (which obligation shall be specifically enforceable and shall not constitute a mortgage, notwithstanding any other laws) to convey to the federal government possession of or title to the redevelopment project and land therein to which such contract relates which is owned by the authority, upon the occurrence of a substantial default (as defined in such contract) with respect to the covenants or conditions to which the authority is subject, such contract may further provide that in case of such conveyance, the federal government may complete, operate, manage, lease, convey or otherwise deal with the redevelopment project in accordance with the terms of such contract; provided, that the contract requires that, as soon as practicable after the federal government is satisfied that all defaults with respect to the redevelopment project have been cured and that the redevelopment project will thereafter be operated in accordance with the terms of the contract, the federal government shall reconvey to the authority the redevelopment project as then constituted.48 Del. Laws, c. 345,\n\n§\n\n 14; \n\n31 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4534;§\n\n4535.
