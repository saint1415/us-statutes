The pastor of the congregation for the time being (if any there be) shall always be present. It may frame such rules and ordinances for the orderly conduct of divine worship and the advancement of the interests of the congregation as a majority of the corporation may from time to time deem necessary, provided that the same shall not conflict with the constitution or laws of the United States or of this State, or with the discipline and practice of the denomination.19 Del.
