C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1708;56 Del. Laws, c. 69;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 8;83 Del. Laws, c. 98,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n1709. Inspections; sampling; analysis.(a) The Department, individually or through its authorized agent, shall sample, inspect, make analyses of, and test commercial feeds and customer-formula feeds distributed within this State at such time and place, and to such an extent as it may deem necessary to determine whether such feeds are in compliance with this chapter.

In cases not covered by such methods, or in cases where methods are available in which improved applicability has been demonstrated, the Secretary may adopt such appropriate methods from other sources.(c) The Department, in determining for administrative purposes whether a commercial feed is deficient in any component, shall be guided solely by the “official sample” as defined in § 1703 of this title and obtained and analyzed as provided for in subsection (b) of this section.(d) When the inspection and analysis of an official sample indicates a commercial feed has been adulterated or misbranded, the results of analysis shall be forwarded by the Department to the distributor and the purchaser.

Laws, c. 69;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 8;83 Del. Laws, c. 98,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n1711. Detained commercial feeds; “withdrawal from distribution” orders; condemnation and confiscation.(a) When the Department or its authorized agent has reasonable cause to believe any lot of commercial feed is being distributed in violation of this chapter or of any of the regulations promulgated under this chapter, it may issue and enforce a written or printed “withdrawal from distribution” order, warning the distributor not to dispose of the lot of feed in any manner until written permission is given by the Department or the Court. The Department shall release any lot of commercial feeds so withdrawn when such distributor has complied with this chapter and the regulations issued hereunder. If compliance is not obtained within 30 days, the Department may begin, or upon request of the distributor shall begin, proceedings for condemnation.(b) Any lot of commercial feed not in compliance with this chapter or regulations promulgated hereunder shall be subject to seizure on complaint of the Department to a court of competent jurisdiction in the area in which said commercial feed is located. In the event the court finds the said commercial feed to be in violation of this chapter or regulations promulgated hereunder and orders the condemnation of said commercial feed, the same shall be disposed of in any manner consistent with the quality of the commercial feed and the laws of the State; provided, that in no instance shall the disposition of said commercial feed be ordered by the court without first giving the claimant an opportunity to apply to the court for release of said commercial feed or for permission to process or relabel said commercial feed to bring it into compliance with this chapter.3 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1711;56 Del. Laws, c. 69;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 8;83 Del. Laws, c. 98,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n1712. Penalties.(a) Any person convicted of violating any of the provisions of this chapter or any regulations hereunder or the rules and regulations issued thereunder, or who shall impede, obstruct, hinder or otherwise prevent or attempt to prevent the Department or its duly authorized agent in performing duties prescribed by this chapter or regulations issued hereunder, shall be fined not more than $250 for the first violation, and not less than $500 for each subsequent violation. In all prosecutions under this chapter involving the composition of a lot of commercial feed, a certified copy of the official analysis signed by the Department shall be accepted as prima facie evidence of the composition.(b) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the Department or its representative to report for prosecution or for the institution of seizure proceedings as a result of minor violations of this chapter where the public interest will be best served by a suitable notice of warning in writing.(c) When any violation of this chapter is reported to the Attorney General, the Attorney General shall cause appropriate proceedings to be instituted and prosecuted in a court of competent jurisdiction without delay. Before the Department reports a violation for prosecution, an opportunity shall be given the distributor to present the distributor’s views to the Department.(d) The Department may apply for and the court may grant a temporary or permanent injunction restraining any person from violating or continuing to violate this chapter or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder notwithstanding the existence of other remedies at law. Any injunction shall be issued without bond.(e) Any person adversely affected by an act, order or ruling made pursuant to this chapter may within 45 days thereafter, bring an action in the Superior Court in the county where the enforcement official has such official’s office, for a new trial of the issues bearing upon such chapter, order or ruling, and upon such trial the Court may issue and enforce such orders, judgments or decrees as the Court may deem proper, just and equitable.3 Del.
