      "text": "§\n\n1;§\n\n802. Purpose.It is the declared purpose of this Program to support, encourage, and promote agriculture production in Delaware as a valued and viable occupation. Promoting and supporting the State’s agricultural producers is essential to maintaining agriculture as a viable industry and important contributor to Delaware’s economy. To ensure long-term agricultural production in Delaware it is necessary to adopt and implement an effective permanent program for yield and revenue insurance assistance for Delaware agricultural producers. It is further recognized that a need exists to create sufficient economic incentives to encourage agricultural production given its vulnerability to weather, environmental and economic conditions that can result in low crop yields, and insufficient revenue, making farming unprofitable and unsustainable. It is the purpose and intent of the General Assembly to provide for the creation of a permanent yield and revenue insurance assistance program to serve the long-term needs of producers in Delaware.84 Del.
