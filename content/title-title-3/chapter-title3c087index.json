When a decree of forfeiture is entered against the article or animal and it is released under bond, or destroyed, court costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses shall be awarded against the person, if any, intervening as claimant of the article or animal.(f) This section shall in no way derogate from authority for condemnation, forfeiture, or seizure conferred by other provisions of this chapter, or other laws.3 Del.
