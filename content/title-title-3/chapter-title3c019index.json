Enforcing agency.This chapter shall be administered by the Department of Agriculture of the State, hereinafter referred to as the “Department.”3 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1902;57 Del. Laws, c. 690.;§\n\n1903. Definitions of words and terms.(a) “Agricultural liming materials” means all suitable materials containing calcium or magnesium in chemical form, physical condition and quantity capable of neutralizing soil acidity.(b) “Limestone” means a material consisting essentially of calcium carbonate or a combination of calcium carbonate with magnesium carbonate capable of neutralizing soil acidity.(1) “Calcitic limestone” shall derive a minimum of 36% calcium from calcium carbonate and the calcium carbonate equivalent shall not be less than 90%;(2) “Dolomitic limestone” shall derive a minimum of 10% of its neutralizing value from magnesium carbonate and a minimum of 20% calcium from calcium carbonate and calcium carbonate equivalent of 90%.(c) “Burnt lime” means a material, made from limestone which consists essentially of calcium oxide or combination of calcium oxide with magnesium oxide.(d) “Hydrated lime” means a material, made from lime, which consists essentially of calcium hydroxide or a combination of calcium hydroxide with magnesium oxide and/or magnesium hydroxide.(e) “Brand” means the term, designation, trademark or other specific designation under which an individual agricultural liming material is offered for sale.(f) “Fineness” means the percentage by weight of the material which will pass sieves of specified sizes. The fineness shall be measured in reference to 10 mesh and 60 mesh sieves of United States standard designation.(g) The fineness guarantee is defined as:(1) Minimum percentage passing through a 10 mesh sieve;(2) Minimum percentage passing through a 60 mesh sieve.Provided, however, that in lieu of this subsection, the Department may in its regulations set minimum standards for fineness for various grades of liming materials, and such grades, when stated, shall become the minimum guarantees of the liming materials so labeled.(h) “Ton” means a net weight of 2,000 pounds avoirdupois.(i) “Percent” or “percentage” means by weight.(j) “Bulk” means in nonpackaged form.(k) “Label” means any written or printed matter on or attached to the package or on the delivery ticket which accompanies bulk shipments.(l) “Person” means individual, partnership, association, firm or corporation.3 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1903;57 Del. Laws, c. 690;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 9;§\n\n1904. Labeling.(a) Agricultural liming materials sold, offered or exposed for sale in this State shall have affixed to each package in a conspicuous manner on the outside thereof, a plainly printed, stamped or otherwise marked label, tag or statement, or in the case of bulk sales, a delivery slip, setting forth at least the following information:(1) The name and principal office address of the manufacturer or distributor;(2) The brand or trade name of the material;(3) The identification of the product as to the type of the agricultural liming material;(4) The net weight of the agricultural liming material;(5) The minimum percentage of calcium and magnesium.(b) No information or statement shall appear on any package, label or delivery slip which is false or misleading to the purchaser as to the quality, analysis, type or composition of the agricultural liming material.(c) In the case of any material which has been adulterated subsequent to packaging, labeling or loading and before delivery to the consumer, a plainly marked notice to that effect shall be affixed by the vendor to the package or delivery slip to identify the kind and degree of such adulteration.(d) At every site from which agricultural liming materials are delivered in bulk and at every place where consumer orders for bulk deliveries are placed, there shall be conspicuously posted a copy of the statement required by this section for each product.(e) At any time after July 1, 1970, when the Department finds, after public hearing following due notice, that the requirements for expressing the guaranteed analysis of calcium and magnesium in elemental form would not impose an economic hardship on distributors and users of liming materials by reason of conflicting labeling requirements among the States, the Department may require by regulation thereafter that the “guaranteed analysis” shall contain the minimum percentages of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in elemental form and calcium carbonate equivalent.3 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1904;57 Del. Laws, c. 690;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 9;§\n\n1905.

C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1905;57 Del. Laws, c. 690;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 9;§\n\n1906. Registration.Before any person shall sell, offer or expose for sale in this State any agricultural liming material, such person shall for each separately identified product file annually with the Department, on forms supplied by the Department or its authorized agent, an application of registration for each such product setting forth the information required by § 1904 of this title.3 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1906;57 Del. Laws, c. 690;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 9;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1907.

Upon compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the registration shall be approved for the period ending on June 30 of the year next following that in which it was issued. No person shall be required to register any agricultural liming material for which a certificate of registration has been filed by the manufacturer or other person responsible for the material.3 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1907;57 Del. Laws, c. 690;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 9;67 Del. Laws, c. 260,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1908.

C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1910;57 Del. Laws, c. 690;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 9;§\n\n1911. Assessment for deficiency.(a) If the analysis of any agricultural liming material shall fall as much as, or more than, 10% in value below the value of the manufacturer’s guarantee, the Department of Agriculture shall assess twice the value of such deficiency against the manufacturer, dealer or agent who sold such agricultural liming material. The assessment shall be based upon the selling price of such agricultural liming material, and the Department of Agriculture shall require the manufacturer, dealer or agent to make good such assessment to all persons who purchased such lot of agricultural liming material from which such deficient sample or samples were drawn, take receipt therefor and forward it promptly to the Department of Agriculture. If the purchaser or purchasers cannot be found, the amount of such assessment shall be paid to the Department of Agriculture who shall transfer such funds to the State Treasurer to be credited to the General Fund of this State.(b) The Department of Agriculture may seize any agricultural liming material belonging to such manufacturer, dealer or agent, if the assessment shall not be paid within 3 months after notice to such manufacturer, dealer or agent has been given by the Department of Agriculture.3 Del.
