Laws, c. 358,\n\n§\n\n 2;78 Del. Laws, c. 179,\n\n§\n\n 166;§\n\n2211. Involuntary treatment.(a) A person in need of treatment shall be involuntarily admitted to a licensed residential treatment facility or outpatient treatment program upon a written request for involuntary treatment that provides a factual basis for the request by anyone with knowledge that an individual may be a person in need of treatment and the written certification by a physician that the individual is a person in need of treatment as provided for in this chapter. The request for involuntary treatment shall concisely provide the observations, circumstances and knowledge of the requestor regarding the requestor’s belief that a particular individual is in need of treatment. The request shall also contain the written certificate of a physician stating that the physician has reviewed the request and examined the patient and concluded that in the physician’s medical opinion the particular individual is a person in need of treatment and is either incapable of or unwilling to consent to treatment. If the individual is incapable of consenting to treatment, the certificate shall state with particularity the physician’s findings regarding why the individual is incapable of providing voluntary informed consent to treatment. The refusal to undergo treatment does not in itself constitute evidence of lack of judgment as to the need for treatment.(b) Any peace officer or designated transport personnel may lawfully transport an individual whom they reasonably believe is a person in need of treatment without the consent of said individual, to or from a hospital, physician’s office or licensed treatment facility for the purpose of carrying out this section.(c) Upon admission of the person in need of treatment, the facility shall evaluate and treat the individual as medically necessary and appropriate for a period not to exceed 2 working days.(d) The State Treasurer shall pay sheriffs and deputy sheriffs for service as peace officers under this section at the rate of the state’s mileage reimbursement amount for each mile necessarily traveled and a custody fee of $25 for the first peace officer and $15 for each additional peace officer, and shall pay medical doctors for services under this section $15 for each case, unless the medical doctor is reimbursed under another public or private plan.(e) The administrator in charge of a licensed treatment facility shall refuse an application if the request for treatment or physician’s certificate fails to meet the requirements of this section.73 Del. Laws, c. 358,\n\n§\n\n 2;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2212. Commitment; judicial proceedings.(a) Not more than 2 working days after the date a patient is admitted to a licensed treatment facility or program under a request for involuntary treatment, the administrator of the treatment facility, through the Attorney General, shall file a petition for involuntary commitment to a licensed treatment facility, supported by affidavit with the Court, unless the patient is discharged or admitted on a voluntary basis. The petition shall state that the administrator, as petitioner, based upon an evaluation by a physician, reasonably and in good faith believes that the involuntary patient (who shall be named as respondent) is a person in need of treatment who should be continued as a patient at the facility pursuant to this chapter until the patient is determined no longer to be in need of treatment at the treatment facility or program. The petition shall also state that the involuntary patient has been advised of the patient’s procedural and substantive rights under this chapter. A copy of supporting certificates by an examining physician shall be attached to the petition.(b) Upon the filing of a petition, the facility may continue to treat the patient as medically necessary and appropriate on an involuntary basis pending a judicial hearing on the petition.(c) The petition shall indicate the facility’s reasonable belief, based upon investigation, as to whether the involuntary patient is able to afford counsel and an independent expert witness.73 Del. Laws, c. 358,\n\n§\n\n 2;§\n\n2213. Limitation on involuntary treatment.Subject to Chapters 50 and 51 of this title, no person shall be involuntarily admitted or committed to or confined as a patient at a residential treatment facility, and such facilities, other than general hospitals, shall not admit or confine as an involuntary patient any person, unless:(1) Such person is determined to be a person in need of treatment in accordance with the procedures of this chapter; and(2) Said treatment facility has been specifically designated as an appropriate facility for the treatment of involuntary adult patients by the Secretary of Health and Social Services and by the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families for the treatment of involuntary minor patients.73 Del. Laws, c. 358,\n\n§\n\n 2;§\n\n2214. Hearing on petition; notice; decision; review.Upon the filing of the petition the court shall promptly:(1) Schedule a hearing to determine based on clear and convincing evidence whether the patient is a person in need of treatment and that cause exists for the involuntary treatment of the patient, and if unable to afford counsel, to appoint counsel to represent the involuntary patient. Such hearing shall be held as soon as practicable, but no later than 8 working days from the filing of the petition.(2) Direct that notice of the hearing and copies of pleadings be supplied to the involuntary patient and the patient’s counsel. In the case of a minor, copies of the pleading will be supplied to the patient’s parents or legal guardian.(3) Enter such other orders as may be appropriate, including an order authorizing the continued involuntary treatment of the patient until further order of the court.(4) If the court determines after a hearing that the patient is not a person in need of treatment or that such patient does not need involuntary treatment, the patient shall be discharged in accord with the court’s order. If the court determines that the patient is a person in need of treatment who is unwilling to accept or incapable of accepting voluntary treatment, it may order continued treatment for an additional period not to exceed 30 days. Thereafter, the court shall schedule an additional hearing within 30 days to review the need for continued involuntary treatment unless the court is informed the patient is under voluntary treatment or has been appropriately discharged from treatment. If continued involuntary treatment is warranted beyond the 30 days, the court shall hold hearings to determine the necessity for continued involuntary treatment at intervals of not more than 6 months.

Whether the involuntary patient’s confinement is based upon sufficient cause;b. Whether the involuntary patient is a person in need of treatment; andc. Whether a less restrictive placement such as nonresidential treatment is more appropriate. Such hearings shall be without jury and not open to the public and shall be preceded by adequate notice to the involuntary patient, and the involuntary patient shall be entitled to be present at all such hearings.(3) Representation by counsel at all judicial proceedings, such counsel to be court-appointed if the involuntary patient cannot afford to retain counsel;(4) Examination by an independent, licensed professional in the area of substance abuse and treatment and to have such persons testify as a witness on the patient’s behalf, such witness to be court-appointed if the involuntary patient cannot afford to retain such witness.(5) Reasonable discovery, the opportunity to summon and cross-examine witnesses, to present evidence on the person’s own behalf and to all other procedural rights afforded litigants in civil causes.

Discharge by the facility.Notwithstanding the pendency of the action or any order previously entered by the court, if at any time after the petition is filed the staff of the facility determines that the involuntary patient is no longer in need of involuntary treatment, the facility may so certify in writing and discharge the patient, and shall promptly notify the court of its discharge, and the court may dismiss the action.73 Del. Laws, c. 358,\n\n§\n\n 2;§\n\n2217. Changing to voluntary status.An involuntary patient is entitled to change that patient’s own status to that of a voluntary patient if a member of the staff of the facility certifies that:(1) The patient is reasonably capable of understanding the nature of the decision to change status; and(2) Such a change is in the patient’s best interest. If such a change in status is challenged within 2 days by the patient’s next of kin or legal representative, the court will schedule a hearing to finally determine the matter.73 Del. Laws, c. 358,\n\n§\n\n 2;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2218. Enlargement of time.Notwithstanding the above provisions of this chapter, except for the time to appeal, the court may enlarge the time for performance for a reasonable period upon a showing of good cause.73 Del. Laws, c. 358,\n\n§\n\n 2;§\n\n2219. Appeal; rules of procedure.(a) Any party to the proceedings may appeal an order of discharge or involuntary treatment to the Supreme Court within 30 days of the entry of such order. The appeal shall not operate as a stay of the order of disposition unless the court or the Supreme Court so directs.(b) The Superior Court and the Family Court may adopt such rules of procedure as may be required to implement the procedural requirements of this chapter.73 Del.
