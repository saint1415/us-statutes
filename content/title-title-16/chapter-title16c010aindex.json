Reporting of infections by physicians.In accordance with this chapter, a physician who diagnoses and treats a healthcare associated infection related to a clinical procedure, such as a surgical procedure or device insertion, or a licensed practitioner who is permitted by law to diagnose and treat such infection and does so, is required to report the infection back to the healthcare facility at which the clinical procedure was performed. The infection prevention department of the healthcare facility will then be required to report to the Department only those infections that meet the accepted National Healthcare Safety Network definitions and are currently required to be reported by law.78 Del. Laws, c. 351,\n\n§\n\n 1;85 Del. Laws, c. 168,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n1004A.

Following the 7-day review period, such quarterly reports shall be made available to the public at each hospital and through the Department (the “public report” ).(2) If the hospital is a division or subsidiary of another entity that owns or operates other hospitals or related organizations, the quarterly report shall be for the specific division or subsidiary and not for the other entity.(c) The Department may revise categories of infections set forth in subsection (a) of this section upon consultation with the Advisory Committee and other experts in infection, prevention, identification and control.76 Del. Laws, c. 122,\n\n§\n\n 1;77 Del. Laws, c. 233,\n\n§§\n\n 1, 2;78 Del. Laws, c. 351,\n\n§\n\n 1;85 Del. Laws, c. 168,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n1005A.

The annual report shall be made available to any person upon request.(e) No hospital report or Department disclosure may contain information identifying a patient, employee or licensed healthcare professional in connection with a specific infection incident.(f) The annual report shall provide background information about each hospital which shall include: the hospital’s adult and pediatric populations, bed size, and specialty divisions; whether the hospital provides tertiary care; and whether the hospital is a teaching or a nonteaching institution. This background information shall be included in the public report.(g) The annual report shall include a brief summary report to allow hospitals to comment on performance improvement and changes in patient population and risk factors. The information contained in the summary report shall be considered proprietary information and shall be utilized by the Department but shall not be made available in the public report and shall not be subject to disclosure under the State’s Freedom of Information Act (Chapter 100 of Title 29).76 Del.
