Strengthen their own programs and laws for the care and treatment of the mentally disordered offender.2. Encourage and provide for such care and treatment in the most appropriate locations, giving due recognition to the need to achieve adequacy of diagnosis, care, treatment, after-care and auxiliary services and facilities and, to every extent practicable, to do so in geographic locations convenient for providing a therapeutic environment.3. Authorize cooperation among the party states in providing services and facilities when it is found that cooperative programs can be more effective and efficient than programs separately pursued.4. Place each mentally disordered offender in a legal status which will facilitate each such mentally disordered offender’s care, treatment and rehabilitation.5. Authorize research and training of personnel on a cooperative basis, in order to improve the quality or quantity of personnel available for the proper staffing of programs, services and facilities for mentally disordered offenders.6. Care for and treat mentally disordered offenders under conditions which will improve the public safety.(b) Within the policies set forth in this Article, it is the purpose of this compact to:1. Authorize negotiation, entry into and operations under contractual arrangements among any 2 or more of the party states for the establishment and maintenance of cooperative programs in any 1 or more of the fields for which specific provision is made in the several articles of this compact.2. Set the limits within which such contracts may operate, so as to assure protection of the civil rights of mentally disordered offenders, and protection of the rights and obligations of the public and of the party states.3. Facilitate the proper disposition of criminal charges pending against mentally disordered offenders, so that programs for their care, treatment and rehabilitation may be carried on efficiently.ARTICLE II\n\nDefinitionsAs used in this compact:(1) “Mentally disordered offender” means a person who has been determined, by adjudication or other method legally sufficient for the purpose in the party state where the determination is made, to be mentally ill and: A. is under sentence for the commission of crime; or B. who is confined or committed on account of the commission of an offense for which, in the absence of mental illness, such person would be subject to incarceration in a penal or correctional facility.(2) “Patient” means a mentally disordered offender who is cared for, treated or transferred pursuant to this compact.(3) “Sending state” means a state, party to this compact, in which the mentally disordered offender was convicted or the state in which such offender would be subject to trial and conviction of any offense, except for such offender’s mental condition, or, within the meaning of Article V of this compact, the state whose authorities have filed a petition in connection with an untried indictment, information or complaint.(4) “Receiving state” means a state, party to this compact, to which a mentally disordered offender is sent for care, aftercare, treatment or rehabilitation, or within the meaning of Article V of this compact, the state in which a petition in connection with an untried indictment, information or complaint has been filed.ARTICLE III\n\nContracts(a) Each party state may make 1 or more contracts with any 1 or more of the other party states for the care and treatment of mentally disordered offenders, on behalf of a sending state, in facilities situated in receiving states, or for the participation of such mentally disordered offenders in programs of aftercare on conditional release administered by the receiving state.

The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. That record, together with any recommendations of the hearing officials, shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.

If the mentally disordered offender is a patient in a receiving state, the appropriate authorities of the sending state, upon recommendation of the appropriate authorities in the receiving state, shall, if they concur in the recommendation, file the petition contemplated by this paragraph.(b) The court shall hold a hearing on the petition within 30 days of the filing thereof. Such hearing shall be only to determine whether the proper safeguarding and advancement of the public interest; the condition of the mentally disordered offender; and the prospects for more satisfactory care, treatment and the rehabilitation of that mentally disordered offender warrant disposition of the untried indictment, information or complaint prior to termination of the defendant’s status as a mentally disordered offender in the sending state. The prosecuting officer of the jurisdiction from which the untried indictment, information or complaint is pending, the petitioning authorities and such other persons as the court may determine shall be entitled to be heard.(c) Upon any hearing pursuant to this Article, the court may order such adjournments or continuances as may be necessary for the examination or observation of the mentally disordered offender, or for the securing of necessary evidence. In granting or denying any such adjournment or continuance, the court shall give primary consideration to the purposes of this compact and more particularly to the need for expeditious determination of the legal and mental status of a mentally disordered offender so that such offender’s care, treatment and discharge to the community only under conditions which will be consonant with the public safety may be implemented.(d) The presence of a mentally disordered offender within a state wherein a petition is pending or being heard pursuant to this Article or such offender’s presence within any other state through which such offender is being transported in connection with such petition or hearing shall be only for the purposes of this compact and no court, agency or person shall have or obtain jurisdiction over such mentally disordered offender for any other purpose by reason of such offender’s presence pursuant to this Article. The mentally disordered offender shall at all times remain in the custody of the sending state. Any acts of officers, employees or agencies of the receiving state in providing or facilitating detention, housing or transportation for the mentally disordered offender shall be only as agents for the sending state.(e) Promptly upon conclusion of the hearing, the court shall dismiss the untried indictment, information or complaint, if it finds that the purposes enumerated in paragraph (b) of this Article would be served thereby. Otherwise, the court shall make such order with respect to the petition and the untried indictment, information or complaint as may be appropriate in the circumstances and consistent with the status of the defendant as a mentally disordered offender in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state.(f) No fact or other matter established or adjudicated at any hearing pursuant to this Article, or in connection therewith, shall be deemed established or adjudicated, nor shall it be admissible in evidence in any subsequent prosecution of the untried indictment, information or complaint concerned in a petition filed pursuant to this Article unless:1. The defendant or the defendant’s duly empowered legal representative requested or expressly acquiesced in the making of the petition and was afforded an opportunity to participate in person in the hearing; or2. The defendant personally offers or consents to the introduction of the determination or adjudication at such subsequent proceedings.ARTICLE VI\n\nAct Not Reviewable in Receiving State; Return(a) Any decision of the sending state in respect to any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon, and not reviewable within, the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove a patient from the receiving state there is pending against the patient within such state any criminal charge, or if the patient is suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the patient shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport patients pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.(b) A patient who escapes while receiving care and treatment, or who violates provisions of aftercare by leaving the jurisdiction, or while being detained or transported pursuant to this compact shall be deemed an escapee from the sending state and from the state in which the facility is situated or the aftercare was being provided. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for return shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.ARTICLE VII\n\nFederal AidAny state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any facility or program the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant thereto and any patient in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision, provided that, if such program or activity is not part of the customary regimen of the facility or program, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.ARTICLE VIII\n\nEntry Into ForceThis compact shall enter into force, and become effective and binding upon the states so acting, when it has been enacted into law by any 2 states from among the States of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other such states or any other state upon similar action by such state.ARTICLE IX\n\nWithdrawal and TerminationThis compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing it and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until 2 years after the notices provided in such statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed under this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such patients as it may have in other party states pursuant to the provisions of this compact.ARTICLE X\n\nOther Arrangements UnaffectedNothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the custody, care, treatment, rehabilitation or aftercare of patients nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative arrangements.ARTICLE XI\n\nConstruction and SeverabilityThe provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.16 Del.
