Tests by State Chemist; fees.(a) The State Chemist shall make tests in the method or manner as provided in § 7301 of this title to determine the fire test of any sample of kerosene, headlight or other oil for illuminating purposes produced from petroleum sold or offered for sale in this State which any citizen thereof may forward to the State Chemist for such test. Each sample sent shall not be less in quantity than 1 pint and shall be forwarded by express, charges prepaid, contained in a glass, earthen or metal receptacle which has not been used to contain any other substance, securely sealed and accompanied by a fee of $1.00. If such sample stands the legal fire test described in § 7301 of this title and will not burn below 115° Fahrenheit, the State Chemist may retain the $1.00 as a fee, but in the event the sample fails to stand the legal test by burning below 115° Fahrenheit, the $1.00 shall be returned to the sender and a fee of $5.00 charged against the dealer from whom the sample has been obtained, which shall be collected in the same manner as fines are collected, subject to the same rights of appeal.(b) The State Chemist may take from any reservoir, tank, barrel, can or other receptacle in this State, used for holding or storing kerosene, headlight or other oil for illuminating purposes produced from petroleum, a sample not exceeding 1 pint from any such receptacle, for the purpose of submitting and subjecting such oil to a fire test as provided in § 7301 of this title.14 Del.
