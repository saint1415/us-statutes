Said Authority shall consist of 7 members to be appointed by the Governor, 1 of which shall be a resident of the City of Wilmington, 1 a resident of New Castle County, 1 a resident of Kent County, 1 a resident of Sussex County and 3 members at large, all of whom shall be residents of the State.

The terms of the members of the Authority first appointed shall be designated by the Governor to commence on June 1, 1976, and to expire, respectively, 1 on June 30 in each of the years 1977, 1978, 1979 and 1980 and 3 in the year 1981. A member of the Authority shall be eligible for reappointment and shall serve until such member’s successor shall have been appointed and accepted appointment. Upon the expiration of the term of any member the member’s successor shall be appointed for a term of 5 years. The Governor shall fill any vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term. Any member of the Authority may be removed by the Governor for misfeasance, malfeasance or wilful neglect of duty or other cause after notice and a public hearing unless such notice and hearing shall be expressly waived in writing. Each member of the Authority, before entering upon the member’s duties, shall take an oath to administer the duties of the member’s office faithfully and impartially, and such oath shall be on file in the office of the Secretary of State. For the purposes of this section, a member’s residency, political affiliation, position or employment, skill, knowledge and experience in a specified area shall be determined as of the date of the initial appointment of such member.(b) The Authority shall annually elect 1 of its members as chairperson and 1 as vice chairperson. It may appoint an executive director, assistant executive director, treasurer and secretary who need not be members of the Authority, who shall serve at the pleasure of the Authority. They shall receive such compensation as shall be fixed by the Authority.(c) The person designated by resolution of the Authority shall keep a record of the proceedings of the Authority and shall be custodian of all books, documents and papers filed with the Authority, the minute book or journal of the Authority, and its official seal. Said person may cause copies to be made of all minutes and other records and documents of the Authority and may give certificates under the official seal of the Authority to the effect that such copies are true copies, and all persons dealing with the Authority may rely upon such certificates.(d) Three members of the Authority shall constitute a quorum. The affirmative vote of a majority of the members present at a meeting of the Authority having a quorum present shall be necessary for any action taken by the Authority. A vacancy in the membership of the Authority shall not impair the right of a quorum to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the Authority. Any action taken by the Authority under this chapter may be authorized by resolution at any regular or special meeting, and each such resolution shall take effect immediately and need not be published or posted.(e) Before the issuance of any bonds or notes under this chapter, the chairperson, vice chairperson, executive director and assistant executive director and any other member of the Authority authorized by resolution of the Authority to handle funds or sign checks of the Authority shall execute a surety bond in the penal sum of $100,000, or in lieu thereof the chairperson shall obtain a blanket position bond covering the executive director and every member and other employee of the Authority in the penal sum of $100,000.

The Authority may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds or notes subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders or participating facilities.59 Del. Laws, c. 292,\n\n§\n\n 1;67 Del. Laws, c. 152,\n\n§\n\n 3;§\n\n9212. Trust agreement.In the discretion of the Authority any bonds issued under this chapter may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee or trustees, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within the State. Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received or proceeds of any contract or contracts pledged and may convey or mortgage the project or any portion thereof. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including particularly such provisions as have hereinabove been specifically authorized to be included in any resolution or resolutions of the Authority authorizing bonds thereof. Any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the State which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues or other moneys may furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee or trustees, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of a project.59 Del. Laws, c. 292,\n\n§\n\n 1;67 Del. Laws, c. 152,\n\n§\n\n 3;§\n\n9213. Credit of State not pledged.Bonds or notes issued under this chapter shall not be deemed to constitute a debt or liability of the State or of any political subdivisions thereof, other than the Authority, or a pledge of the faith and credit of the State or of any such political subdivision, other than the Authority, but shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided therefor. All such bonds or notes shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the effect that neither the State nor any political subdivision thereof other than the Authority shall be obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon except from revenues of the project or projects or the portion thereof for which they are issued and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State or of any political subdivision thereof other than the Authority is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds. The issuance of bonds under this chapter shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the State or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor, or to make any appropriation for their payment. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent or be construed to prevent the Authority from pledging its full faith and credit or the full faith and credit of a participating facility to the payment of bonds or issue of bonds authorized pursuant to this chapter.59 Del. Laws, c. 292,\n\n§\n\n 1;67 Del. Laws, c. 152,\n\n§\n\n 3;§\n\n9214. Revenues.The Authority may fix, revise, charge and collect rates, rents, fees and charges for the use of and for the services furnished or to be furnished by each project and to contract with any person, partnership, association or corporation, or other body, public or private, in respect thereof. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall be fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of rates, rents, fees and charges from such project so as to provide funds sufficient with other revenues, if any, (1) to pay the principal of and the interest of such project as the same shall become due and payable and (2) to create and maintain reserves required or provided for in any resolution authorizing, or trust agreement securing, such revenue bonds of the Authority. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any department, commission, board, body, bureau or agency of this State, other than the Authority. A sufficient amount of the revenues derived in respect of a project shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or trust agreement in a sinking or other similar fund which is pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds or notes as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds or notes retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the rates, rents, fees and charges and other revenues or other money so pledged and thereafter received by the Authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the Authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in records of the Authority. The use and disposition of money to the credit of such sinking or other similar fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or notes of such trust agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust agreement, such sinking or other similar fund shall be a fund for all such bonds or notes issued to finance a project or projects at 1 or more participating facilities as the case may be, without distinction or priority of 1 over another; provided the Authority in any such resolution or trust agreement may provide that such sinking or other similar fund shall be the fund for a particular project at a facility and for the bonds issued to finance a particular project and may, additionally, permit and provide for the issuance of bonds or notes having a subordinate lien in respect of the security authorized to other bonds or notes of the Authority and, in such case, the Authority may create separate or other similar funds in respect of such subordinate lien bonds.59 Del. Laws, c. 292,\n\n§\n\n 1;67 Del. Laws, c. 152,\n\n§\n\n 3;§\n\n9215. Trust funds.All money received pursuant to the authority of this chapter, whether as proceeds from the sale of bonds or as revenues, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this chapter. Any officer with whom, or any bank or trust company with which, such money shall be deposited shall act as trustee of such money and shall hold and apply the same for the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this chapter and the resolution authorizing the bonds or notes of any issue or the trust agreement securing such bonds or notes may provide.59 Del. Laws, c. 292,\n\n§\n\n 1;67 Del. Laws, c. 152,\n\n§\n\n 3;§\n\n9216. Remedies.Any holder of bonds, notes, bond anticipation notes, other notes or other obligations of the Authority issued under this chapter or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee or trustees under any trust agreement, except to the extent the right herein given may be restricted by any resolution authorizing the issuance of, or any such trust agreement securing, such bonds or other obligations, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust agreement, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this chapter or by such resolution or trust agreement to be performed by the Authority of any officer, employee or agent thereof, including the fixing, charging and collecting of the rates, rents, fees and charges herein authorized and required by such resolution or trust agreement to be fixed, established and collected.59 Del. Laws, c. 292,\n\n§\n\n 1;67 Del. Laws, c. 152,\n\n§\n\n 3;§\n\n9217.

Refunding bonds or notes.(a) The Authority is hereby authorized to provide for the issuance of bonds or notes of the Authority for the purpose of refunding any outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations of the Authority, or of a participating facility, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the earliest or any subsequent date of redemption, purchase, prepayment or maturity of such bonds, notes or other obligations and, if deemed advisable by the Authority, for the additional purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of constructing and acquiring additions, improvements, extensions or enlargements of a project or any portion thereof.(b) The proceeds of any such bonds or notes issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds or notes, may, in the discretion of the Authority, be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding bonds or notes either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date or upon the purchase or at the maturity thereof and may, pending such application, be placed in escrow to be applied to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date as may be determined by the Authority.(c) Any such escrowed proceeds, pending such use, may be invested and reinvested in direct obligations of the United States of America, or in certificates of deposit or time deposits secured by direct obligations of the United States of America, or in any other obligation or security as may be determined by the Authority maturing at such time or times as shall be appropriate to assure the prompt payment, as to principal, interest and redemption premium, if any, of the outstanding bonds or notes to be so refunded. The interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on any such investment may also be applied to the payment of the outstanding bonds or notes to be so refunded. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance of such proceeds and interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on the investments thereof may be returned to the Authority for use by it in any lawful manner.(d) The portion of the proceeds of any such bonds or notes issued for the additional purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of constructing and acquiring additions, improvements, extensions or enlargements of a project may be invested and reinvested in direct obligations of the United States of America, or in certificates of deposit or time deposits secured by direct obligations of the United States of America, or in any other obligation or security as may be determined by the Authority maturing not later than the time or times when such proceeds will be needed for the purpose of paying all or any part of such cost. The interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on such investment may be applied to the payment of all or any part of such cost or may be used by the Authority in any lawful manner.(e) All such bonds or notes shall be subject to this chapter in the same manner and to the same extent as other bonds or notes issued pursuant to this chapter.59 Del. Laws, c. 292,\n\n§\n\n 1;64 Del. Laws, c. 463,\n\n§\n\n 2;66 Del. Laws, c. 92,\n\n§\n\n 18(f), (g);67 Del. Laws, c. 152,\n\n§\n\n 3;§\n\n9219.
