A qualified employee of a public utility which produces, transmits or delivers electricity, or a qualified employee of an approved contractor of such public utility;b.

The person may perform such task only after mutually agreeable measures to prevent contact with the applicable high voltage line or lines (“preventive measures”) have been established and the public utility has given written approval to take such measures and perform the task. Thereafter, such work shall be performed only in accordance with the restrictions or conditions described in such written approval. Such preventive measures may include, but may not be limited to:(1) Coordination of the work and construction schedules between the utility and the person responsible for performing the work;(2) The placement of temporary mechanical barriers to separate and prevent contact between material, equipment and/or persons and the high voltage line;(3) Temporary de-energization and grounding the high voltage lines; and/or(4) Temporary relocation or raising of the high voltage overhead lines.At the sole discretion of the utility, costs incurred in devising and implementing such preventive measures shall be borne by the person responsible for performing the work in dangerous proximity to the high voltage overhead line.72 Del.
