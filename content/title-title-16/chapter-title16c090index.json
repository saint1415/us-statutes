The Department shall either recommend or disapprove each such application and advise the issuing officers of its decision. No favorable recommendation shall be made by the Department unless the Department shall find and determine that:(1) The applicant is a health facilities corporation;(2) The health facilities corporation is in sound financial condition and is reasonably expected to remain in sound financial condition during the term of the subsidy contract;(3) There exists a need for the health facility for which the subsidy contract is sought, taking into account the existing and planned health facilities in the State; and(4) The health facilities corporation has a managerial, administrative and medical staff that has conformed, or, in the case of a health facilities corporation that has not commenced operation of a health facility, is reasonably expected to conform to standards of professional integrity and ability that may reasonably be required by the State.The Department may obtain assistance from other State agencies, from the federal government and from private sources in making the foregoing determinations. The Department may also employ experts to assist it.16 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§§\n\n 9003, 9004;56 Del. Laws, c. 363;59 Del. Laws, c. 455,\n\n§\n\n 4;64 Del. Laws, c. 463,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del.

The issuing officers may, however, take into account in determining the yield, the amount of loan closing costs, if any, incurred by the health facilities corporation that could have been avoided if the loan were being made by the State. The determinations of yield by the issuing officers shall be conclusive.16 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 9005;56 Del. Laws, c. 363;57 Del. Laws, c. 655;58 Del. Laws, c. 405;59 Del.

Subsidy contract — Pledge of support; terms; records; release of mortgages securing outstanding loans.A subsidy contract shall be entered into by the issuing officers on behalf of the State. The subsidy contract shall contain a pledge by the State to make payments, in the amount provided by the subsidy contract, from the Health Facilities Subsidy Fund, to the health facilities corporation from money on deposit in such Fund. No subsidy contract shall be entered into by the issuing officers unless they reasonably determine that the amounts from interest earned or profit realized in the Fund will be available to meet annual payments under the subsidy contract as they become due and payable. The issuing officers shall maintain records of all payments made and all payments owing under subsidy contracts. The issuing officers shall have the power to grant releases or satisfactions of mortgages granted to secure loans made from the Health Facility Construction Fund, provided that the Governor shall execute such release or satisfaction.16 Del.

Repayments of interest on such loans shall be immediately transferred to the General Fund of the State. Principal payments of such loans shall be deposited in the Health Facilities Subsidy Fund until the principal in such Fund, to include the accrued earnings credited to principal as provided in § 9008 of this title, has reached the sum of $4,000,000. Thereafter, upon certification by the State Treasurer that the Fund has been capitalized pursuant to this section, future principal repayments of loans from the Health Facility Construction Fund shall be deposited in the State Treasurer’s Bond Reversion Account.16 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§§\n\n 9005, 9011;56 Del. Laws, c. 363;57 Del. Laws, c. 655;58 Del. Laws, c. 405;58 Del. Laws, c. 503,\n\n§\n\n 2;59 Del. Laws, c. 455,\n\n§\n\n 4;64 Del. Laws, c. 463,\n\n§\n\n 1;65 Del. Laws, c. 125,\n\n§\n\n 2;§\n\n9008. Management of Fund.The Health Facilities Subsidy Fund shall be managed by the State Treasurer in conformance with policies promulgated by the Cash Management Policy Board (established pursuant to § 2716 of Title 29). Interest earned or profit realized from investment of money on deposit in the Health Facilities Subsidy Fund shall be retained in such Fund.64 Del. Laws, c. 463,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n9009. Eligibility for early repayment.If any health facility which has incurred any obligation to the State through loans from the Health Facility Construction Fund chooses to accelerate the repayments of all or a portion of its indebtedness to the State, and chooses to finance its accelerated repayment through funds raised by debt issued through the Delaware Health Facilities Authority or any other debt instrument duly obligating the health facility, the State is hereby authorized to accept as satisfaction for that obligation an amount equal to all accrued interest, to the date of repayment, plus a principal amount equal to the future principal payments (or the portion thereof to be prepaid) on the Health Facility Construction Loan, discounted to their present value at the net interest cost of the new borrowing. In such case, the health facility shall not be eligible for a subsidy contract on that portion of its borrowing from the Health Facilities Authority or other creditor which is used to prepay its loan or loans from the Health Facility Construction Fund. Such payments of principal and interest shall be credited to the various funds and accounts of the State as specified in §§ 9007 and 9008 of this title.65 Del. Laws, c. 125,\n\n§\n\n 3;§§\n\n9010-9019. [Repealed].",
