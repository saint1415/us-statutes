Amount of benefits.(a) The amount of family and medical leave benefits is to be determined as follows:(1) The weekly benefit must be 80% of the covered individual’s average weekly wages rounded up to the nearest even $1.00 increment during the 12 months preceding submission of the application.(2) The minimum weekly benefit may not be less than $100 a week, except that if the covered individual’s average weekly wage is less than $100 a week, the weekly benefit must be the covered individual’s full wage.(3) The maximum weekly benefit in 2026 and 2027 must be $900. In each year after 2027, the maximum weekly benefit must increase in proportion to the annual average increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington Metropolitan area that is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. In each year after 2027, the period of change must be calculated from October 2026 to the October before the start of the calendar year.

If, after using the actuarial principles under subsection (b) of this section, the Department determines that the contribution rate would exceed 1.00%, paragraph (c)(3) of this section applies.(3)Contribution redetermination; benefits reduction. —If, under paragraph (c)(2)b. of this section, the Department determines that the contribution rate effective as of the first day beginning on the next calendar year would exceed 1.00%, effective as of and for such calendar year the Department shall reduce the percentage of average weekly wages for employees from 80% to the lowest percentage of average weekly wages for employees as necessary to compute a contribution rate that does not exceed 1.00%.(4)Preservation of Fund balance. —Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, after using the actuarial principles under subsection (b) of this section and considering other information deemed appropriate under the circumstances by the Secretary, the Secretary may at any time reduce the percentage of average weekly wages for employees to the lowest percentage of average weekly wages for employees as necessary to attempt to prevent the projected balance of the Fund during the ensuing 12 month period from falling below a specific balance or other actuarially sound measure adopted by the Department.(5)Evidentiary standard. —An allegation of abuse in the exercise of the discretion authorized by this section must be established by clear and convincing evidence of actual abuse of discretion in the court then having primary jurisdiction.(d) From the wages of an employee for whom a contribution is required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an employer shall deduct not greater than 50% of the contribution required for the employee.

The employer is liable for the contribution at the time that wages are paid and shall remit the total contribution required under subsection (b) of this section to the Fund. If the employer fails to deduct wages of an employee when the wages are paid, the employer remains liable for the full amount of the contribution, including that amount not deducted from an employee’s wages.(h) A contribution that remains unpaid on the date it is due and payable, as determined by the Department, accrues interest, at a rate determined by the Department by regulation, from and after the due date until payment plus the accrued interest is received by the Fund.

Family and medical leave benefits for intermittent or reduced leave schedules must be prorated.(b) The covered individual shall provide the employer with prior notice of the schedule on which the covered individual will take the covered leave, to the extent practicable. Covered leave taken under this section may not result in a reduction of the total amount of leave to which an employee is entitled beyond the amount of leave actually taken.(c) Nothing in this section is to be construed to entitle a covered individual to more leave than required under § 3703 of this this title.83 Del. Laws, c. 301,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n3707.

If an employer who has violated this section or § 3708 of this title proves to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission that violated this section or § 3708 of this title was in good faith and that the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the act or omission was not a violation of this section or § 3708 of this title, the court may reduce the amount of the liability to the amount and interest determined under paragraphs (c)(1)a. and (c)(1)b. of this section, respectively.(2) For equitable relief as may be appropriate, including employment, reinstatement, and promotion.(d) An action under subsection (c) of this section may be maintained against an employer in a court of competent jurisdiction in this State by any 1 or more employees for and on behalf of the employees or the employees and other employees similarly situated.(e) (1) The court in an action under subsection (c) of this section may, in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff, award reasonable attorneys’ fees, reasonable expert witness fees, and other costs of the action to be paid by the defendant.(2) The court in an action under subsection (c) of this section shall award reasonable attorneys’ fees to a defendant if the court finds the action was brought in bad faith.(f) Except as provided under subsection (g) of this section, an action may be brought for a violation of this section or § 3708 of this title not later than 2 years after the date of the last event constituting the alleged violation for which the action is brought.(g) In an action brought for a wilful violation of this section or § 3708 of this title, the action may be brought not later than 3 years after the date of the last event constituting the alleged violation for which the action is brought.83 Del.
