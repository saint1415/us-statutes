Interest penalties on late payments.(a) Each construction contract awarded by an owner shall include:(1) A payment clause which obligates the owner to pay the contractor for satisfactory performance under the contract within 30 days of the end of the billing period;(2) An interest penalty clause which obligates the owner to pay the contractor an interest penalty on amounts due in the case of each payment not made in accordance with the payment clause included in the contract pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;(3) The clause required by this subsection shall not be construed to impair the right of the owner to include in its contracts provisions which permit the owner to retain a specified percentage of each progress payment otherwise due to a contractor for satisfactory performance under the contract without incurring any obligation to incur an interest penalty, in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties to the contract. In such a case, the owner must provide written notice to contractor as to why payment is being withheld within 7 days of the date required for payment to the contractor.(b) Each construction contract awarded by a contractor shall include:(1) A payment clause which obligates the contractor to pay the subcontractor and each supplier for satisfactory performance under the subcontract within 30 days out of such amounts as are paid to the contractor; and(2) An interest penalty clause which obligates the contractor to pay the subcontractor and each supplier an interest penalty on amounts due in the case of each payment not made in accordance with the payment clause included in the contract pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.(c) The interest penalty shall apply to the period beginning on the day after the required date and ending on the date on which payment of that amount due is made and shall be computed at the legal rate in effect at the time the obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty accrues.

The owner shall pay all undisputed amounts owed to the contractor within 30 days after the end of the billing period or 30 days after delivery of the invoice, whichever is later. This subsection shall not be construed to impair the right of an owner to include in a contract provisions that permit the owner to retain a specified percentage of each progress payment otherwise due to a contractor and each supplier for satisfactory performance under the contract.(d) If subcontractor payment terms are not specified in the contract between the owner and a general or prime contractor, or in the contract between the general or prime contractor and a subcontractor, or in the contract between the subcontractors, a general contractor, prime contractor or subcontractor shall pay all undisputed amounts owed to its subcontractors, suppliers and/or materialmen within 15 days after receipt by the general contractor, prime contractor or subcontractor of each payment received for work performed or materials supplied by its subcontractors, suppliers and/or materialmen.

An amount shall not be deemed to have been wrongfully withheld to the extent that it bears a reasonable relationship to the value of any disputed amount or claim held in good faith by the owner, contractor or subcontractor against whom the contractor or subcontractor is seeking to recover payment.(b) Absent any agreements to the contrary between the parties, the arbitrator in any arbitration proceeding arising under this chapter shall award to the substantially prevailing party its reasonable attorneys’ fees, arbitration costs and expenses for expert witnesses.(c) This section shall not apply to:(1) Public works contracts awarded under Chapter 69 of Title 29;(2) Contracts for the erection of 6 or fewer residential units which are under construction simultaneously, or for the alteration or repair of any single residential unit; or(3) Contracts for the purchase of materials by a person performing work on that person’s own real property.(d) This section shall not apply where the terms of a contract between a general or prime contractor and subcontractor specifies different terms regarding the award of attorney fees and litigation costs in an arbitration or judicial proceeding.73 Del.
