Upon application to the court, an injunction shall be terminated when the trade secret has ceased to exist, but the injunction may be continued for an additional reasonable period of time in order to eliminate commercial advantage that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation.(b) In exceptional circumstances, an injunction may condition future use upon payment of a reasonable royalty for no longer than the period of time for which use could have been prohibited. Exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to, a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation that renders a prohibitive injunction inequitable.(c) In appropriate circumstances, affirmative acts to protect a trade secret may be compelled by court order.63 Del. Laws, c. 218,\n\n§\n\n 1;71 Del. Laws, c. 80,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2003. Damages.(a) Except to the extent that a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation renders a monetary recovery inequitable, a complainant is entitled to recover damages for misappropriation. Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator’s unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.(b) If wilful and malicious misappropriation exists, the court may award exemplary damages in an amount not exceeding twice any award made under subsection (a) of this section.63 Del. Laws, c. 218,\n\n§\n\n 1;71 Del. Laws, c. 80,\n\n§\n\n 2;§\n\n2004. Attorneys’ fees.If a claim of misappropriation is made in bad faith, a motion to terminate an injunction is made or resisted in bad faith, or wilful and malicious misappropriation exists, the court may award reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party.63 Del. Laws, c. 218,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2005. Preservation of secrecy.In an action under this chapter, a court shall preserve the secrecy of an alleged trade secret by reasonable means, which may include granting protective orders in connection with discovery proceedings, holding in-camera hearings, sealing the records of the action and ordering any person involved in the litigation not to disclose an alleged trade secret without prior court approval.63 Del. Laws, c. 218,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2006. Statute of limitations.An action for misappropriation must be brought within 3 years after the misappropriation is discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered. For the purposes of this section, a continuing misappropriation constitutes a single claim.63 Del. Laws, c. 218,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2007. Effect on other law.(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, this chapter displaces conflicting tort, restitutionary and other law of this State providing civil remedies for misappropriation of a trade secret.(b) This chapter does not affect:(1) Contractual remedies, whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret;(2) Other civil remedies that are not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret; or(3) Criminal remedies, whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret.63 Del. Laws, c. 218,\n\n§\n\n 1;71 Del. Laws, c. 80,\n\n§\n\n 3;§\n\n2008. Application and construction of chapter.This chapter shall be applied and construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of this chapter among states enacting it.63 Del. Laws, c. 218,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2009. Short title.This chapter may be cited as the “Uniform Trade Secrets Act.”63 Del. Laws, c. 218,\n\n§\n\n 1;",
