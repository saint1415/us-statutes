Civil actions for false claims.(a)Responsibilities of the Attorney General. —The Attorney General shall diligently investigate suspected violations under this chapter. If the Attorney General finds that a person has violated or is violating the provisions of this chapter, the Attorney General may bring a civil action under this section against the person.(b)Private actions. —(1) A private civil action may be brought by any person or labor organization as defined by § 1107A(d) of Title 19 (hereinafter “private party” or “party”) for a violation of this chapter on behalf of the party bringing suit and for the government. The action shall be brought in the name of the government. The action may be dismissed only if the court and the Department of Justice give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting.(2) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the private party possesses shall be served on the Department of Justice pursuant to Rules 4 and 5 of the Superior Court Civil Rules. The complaint shall be filed in camera and shall remain under seal for at least 60 days. The complaint shall not be served on the defendant until the expiration of 60 days or any extension approved under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Within 60 days after receiving a copy of the complaint, the Department of Justice shall conduct an investigation of the factual allegations and legal contentions made in the complaint. The Department of Justice may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after it receives the complaint, the material evidence and information.(3) The Department of Justice may, for good cause shown, move the court for extensions of the time during which the complaint remains under seal under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Any such motion may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant shall not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until 20 days after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant pursuant to Rule 4 of the Superior Court Civil Rules.(4) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or within 20 days of being notified by the court that the seal has expired, the Department of Justice shall:a. Proceed with the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by the Department of Justice; orb. Notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the private party bringing the action shall have the right to conduct the action.(5) When a party brings an action under this subsection, no party other than the Department of Justice may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.72 Del. Laws, c. 370,\n\n§\n\n 1;77 Del. Laws, c. 166,\n\n§§\n\n 7-12;79 Del. Laws, c. 141,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1204. Rights of the parties to qui tam actions.(a) If the Department of Justice proceeds with the action, it shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the party bringing the action. Such party shall have the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations set forth in subsections (b), (c) and (e) of this section.(b) The Department of Justice may dismiss the action notwithstanding the objections of the party initiating the action if the party has been notified by the Department of Justice of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the party with an opportunity for a hearing on the motion.(c) The Department of Justice may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the party initiating the action if the court determines after a hearing that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate and reasonable under all the circumstances. Upon a showing of good cause, such hearing may be held in camera.(d) If the Department of Justice elects not to proceed with the action, the party who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action. If the Department of Justice so requests, it shall be served with copies of the pleadings filed in the action and shall be supplied with copies of all deposition transcripts (at the Department of Justice’s expense). When a party proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of the party initiating the action, may nevertheless permit the Department of Justice to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.(e) Whether or not the Department of Justice proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the Department of Justice that certain actions of discovery by the party initiating the action would interfere with the Department of Justice’s investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further showing in camera that the Department of Justice has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings.(f) Notwithstanding § 1203(b) of this title, the Department of Justice may elect to pursue its claim through any available alternate remedy, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the party initiating the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such party would have had if the action had continued under this chapter; provided however, that no insurer subject to the insurance fraud provisions of Chapter 24 of Title 18 shall have a cause of action pursuant to this chapter. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this chapter. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been fully determined on appeal to the appropriate court, if all time for filing such appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.72 Del. Laws, c. 370,\n\n§\n\n 1;77 Del. Laws, c. 166,\n\n§§\n\n 13-18;§\n\n1205. Award to qui tam plaintiff.(a) If the Department of Justice proceeds with an action brought by a party under § 1203(b) of this title, such party shall, subject to the second sentence of this subsection, receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the party substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. Where the action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information (other than information provided by the party bringing the action) relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil or administrative hearing, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the party bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation. Any payment to a party under the first or second sentence of this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds. Any such party shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. In determining the amount of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, the court shall consider, without limitation, whether such fees and costs were necessary to the prosecution of the action, were incurred for activities which were duplicative of the activities of the Department of Justice in prosecuting the case, or were repetitious, irrelevant or for purposes of harassment, or caused the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense. All such expenses, fees and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.(b) If the Department of Justice does not proceed with an action under this chapter, the party bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of such proceeds. Such party shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. In determining the amount of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, the court shall consider, without limitation, whether such fees and costs were necessary to the prosecution of the action, were incurred for activities which were repetitious, irrelevant or for purposes of harassment, or caused the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.(c) Whether or not the Department of Justice proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a party who planned and initiated the violation upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the party would otherwise receive under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, taking into account the role of that party in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the party bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from that party’s own role in the violation of this chapter, that party shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the Department of Justice to continue the action on behalf of the government.(d) If the Department of Justice does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.72 Del. Laws, c. 370,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;77 Del. Laws, c. 166,\n\n§§\n\n 19-22;§\n\n1206. Certain actions barred or limited.(a) In no event may a person bring an action under this chapter which is based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative proceeding in which the government is already a party, or which is based upon the reporting requirements of § 1142 of Title 12. This subsection shall have no effect on the Attorney General’s ability to bring any such action.(b) The court shall dismiss an action or claim under this section, unless opposed by the government, if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed:(1) In any criminal, civil, or administrative hearing in which the government or its agent is a party;(2) In any government-generated report, hearing, audit, or investigation; or(3) From the news media.The requirement to dismiss actions or claims as set forth in this subsection shall not apply to actions brought by the Attorney General or where the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.(c) For purposes of this section, “original source” means an individual who either:(1) Prior to a public disclosure under subsection (b) of this section, has voluntarily disclosed to the government the information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based; or(2) Who has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions, and who has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section.(d) The Attorney General may only bring an action under this chapter which is based upon the reporting requirements of § 1142 of Title 12 if all of the following are true:(1) The Attorney General has provided written notice to the Secretary of the Department of Finance and the State Escheator setting forth the allegations intended to be pursued.(2) Either:(a) One hundred twenty days have passed since the date of such notice; or(b) The State Escheator has consented in writing to the institution of such action prior to the expiry of the 120-day period.(3) There is no ongoing examination by the State Escheator pursuant to subchapter II of Chapter 11 of Title 12 concerning the allegations in the Attorney General’s complaint at the time such complaint is filed.(4) The defendant in such action did not initiate a voluntary disclosure under § 1173 of Title 12 of the specific matters that are the subject of the Attorney General’s intended action prior to the date on which the Attorney General first become aware of or commenced investigating such matters.72 Del. Laws, c. 370,\n\n§\n\n 1;77 Del. Laws, c. 166,\n\n§\n\n 23;79 Del. Laws, c. 141,\n\n§\n\n 1;84 Del. Laws, c. 367,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n1207. Government not liable for certain expenses.No Government shall be liable for expenses which a party incurs in bringing an action under this chapter.72 Del. Laws, c. 370,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1208. Employee protection.(a) Any employee, contractor, or agent shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make that employee, contractor, or agent whole, if that employee, contractor, or agent is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment because of lawful acts done by the employee, contractor, agent or associated others in furtherance of an action under this chapter or other efforts to stop 1 or more violations of this chapter.Such relief shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status that employee, contractor, or agent would have had but for the discrimination, 2 times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. An action under this subsection may be brought in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for the county where the violation is alleged to have occurred. A civil action under this subsection may not be brought more than 3 years after the date when the alleged retaliation occurred.(b) It shall be the duty of every employer of more than 15 employees to post and maintain in a place accessible to its employees and where they normally pass a summary of this chapter upon request and without charge. Such summaries shall be provided by the Delaware Department of Justice to the Delaware Department of Labor for distribution. As an alternative to posting, such employer may establish written policies for all employees that provide an explanation of state and federal False Claims Act [this chapter and 31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq.] provisions and a resource for obtaining additional information about the law.72 Del. Laws, c. 370,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;77 Del. Laws, c. 166,\n\n§\n\n 24;79 Del. Laws, c. 141,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1209. False claims and reporting procedure.(a) A civil action under this chapter may not be brought:(1) More than 6 years after the date on which the violation is committed; or(2) More than 3 years after the date when facts material to the right of action are known or reasonably should have been known by the official of the Government charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances,but in no event more than 10 years after the date on which the violation is committed, whichever occurs last.(b) In any action brought under this chapter, the Department of Justice or the private party shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence.(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Delaware Rules of Criminal Procedure, or the Delaware Rules of Civil Procedure, a final judgment rendered in favor of the Government in any criminal proceeding charging fraud or false statements, whether upon a verdict after trial or upon a plea of guilty, shall estop the defendant from denying the essential elements of the offense in any action which involves the same transaction as in the criminal proceeding and which is brought under this chapter.(d) Upon motion of the Department of Justice, the court shall have the power to grant other equitable relief, including temporary injunctive relief, as is necessary to prevent the transfer, concealment or dissipation of the illegal proceeds, or to protect the public.(e) For statute of limitations purposes, any Government pleading shall relate back to the filing date of the complaint of the person who originally brought the action, to the extent that the claim of the Government arises out of the conduct, transactions, or occurrences set forth, or attempted to be set forth, in the prior complaint of that person.72 Del. Laws, c. 370,\n\n§\n\n 1;77 Del. Laws, c. 166,\n\n§§\n\n 25, 26;79 Del. Laws, c. 141,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1210.
