State standards of weights and measures.Such weights and measures in conformity with the standards of the United States as have been supplied to the State by the federal government or otherwise obtained by the State for use as state standards shall, when the same shall have been approved as being satisfactory for use as such by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, be the state standards of weight and measure. The state standards shall be kept in a safe and suitable place in the office or laboratory of the Department of Agriculture, they shall not be removed from the said office or laboratory except for repairs or for calibration and approval. The state standards shall be used only in verifying the office standards and for scientific purposes.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5104;53 Del. Laws, c. 187,\n\n§\n\n 3;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 31A;58 Del. Laws, c. 281,\n\n§\n\n 3;70 Del. Laws, c. 370,\n\n§\n\n 5;§\n\n5105. Field standards and equipment.In addition to the state standards provided for in § 5104 of this title, there shall be supplied by the State such “field standards” and such equipment as may be found necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter. The field standards shall be verified upon their initial receipt and thereafter as often as deemed necessary by the Secretary by comparison with state standards. The specifications and tolerances for reference standard and field standard weights and measures shall be those as specified in Handbooks 105-1, 105-2 and 105-3 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and supplements thereto, or in any publication superseding these publications.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5105;53 Del. Laws, c. 187,\n\n§\n\n 3;58 Del. Laws, c. 281,\n\n§\n\n 4;70 Del. Laws, c. 370,\n\n§\n\n 6;§\n\n5106. General powers and duties of Secretary of Agriculture.The Secretary of Agriculture shall have the custody of the state standards of weight and measure and of the other standards and equipment provided for by this chapter, and shall keep accurate records of the same. The Secretary of Agriculture shall enforce the provisions of this chapter. The Secretary of Agriculture shall have and keep a general supervision over the weights and measures offered for sale, sold, or in use in the State.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5108;53 Del.

Specific powers and duties of Secretary of Agriculture; regulations.The Secretary shall issue from time to time reasonable regulations for the enforcement of this chapter, which regulations shall have the force and effect of law. These regulations may include (1) standards of net weight, measure, or count, and reasonable standards of fill, for any commodity in package form, (2) rules governing the technical and reporting procedures to be followed and the report and record forms and marks of approval and rejection to be used by inspectors of weights and measures in the discharge of their official duties, (3) exemptions from the sealing or marking requirements of § 5113 of this chapter with respect to weights and measures of such character or size that such sealing or marking would be inappropriate, impracticable or damaging to the apparatus in question, and (4) rules governing the voluntary registration of service people and service agencies. These regulations shall include specifications, tolerances and other technical requirements for weights and measures of the character of those specified in § 5109 of this chapter, designed to eliminate from use, without prejudice to apparatus that conforms as closely as practicable to the official standards, those (1) that are not accurate, (2) that are of such construction that they are faulty — that is, that are not reasonably permanent in their adjustment or will not repeat their indications correctly — or (3) that facilitate the perpetration of fraud. The specifications, tolerances and other technical requirements for commercial weighing and measuring devices, together with amendments thereto, as recommended by the National Bureau of Standards and published in the National Bureau of Standards Handbook 44 and supplements thereto, or in any publication revising or superseding Handbook 44, shall be the specifications, tolerances and other technical requirements for commercial weighing and measuring devices of the State, except insofar as specifically modified, amended or rejected by a regulation issued by the Secretary. For the purposes of this chapter, apparatus shall be deemed to be “correct,” when it conforms to the requirements of the National Type Evaluation Program of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. A certificate of conformance must be issued prior to the use of such weight(s) and measure(s) or weighing and measuring device for commercial or law-enforcement purposes, except insofar as specifically modified, amended, or rejected by a regulation issued by the Secretary of Agriculture. Pending the issuance of a certificate of conformance, the Department may permit such weight(s) and measure(s) or weighing and measuring device to be used provided it meets the specifications and tolerances for that particular weight and measure or weighing device as set forth in the National Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook 44.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5109;53 Del. Laws, c. 187,\n\n§\n\n 3;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§§\n\n 31C, E, F;58 Del. Laws, c. 281,\n\n§\n\n 5;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del.

Testing at state-supported institutions.The Secretary of Agriculture shall from time to time test all weights and measures used in checking the receipt or disbursement of supplies in every institution for the maintenance of which moneys are appropriated by the General Assembly, reporting those findings in writing to the supervisory board and to the executive officer of the institution concerned.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5110;53 Del. Laws, c. 187,\n\n§\n\n 3;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 31C;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5109. General testing.When not otherwise provided by law, the Secretary of Agriculture shall have the power to inspect and test, to ascertain if they are correct, all weights and measures kept, offered, or exposed for sale. It shall be the duty of the Secretary of Agriculture, within a 12-month period or less frequently if in accordance with a schedule issued by the Secretary of Agriculture, and as much more often as deemed necessary to inspect and test, to ascertain if they are correct, all weights and measures commercially used (1) in determining the weight, measurement, or count of commodities or things sold, or offered or exposed for sale, on the basis of weight, measure, or of count, or (2) in computing the basic charge or payment for services rendered on the basis of weight, measure, or of count; provided, that with respect to single-service devices — that is, devices designed to be used commercially only once and to be then discarded — and with respect to devices uniformly mass-produced, as by means of a mold or die, and not susceptible of individual adjustment, tests may be made on representative samples of such devices; and the lots of which such samples are representative shall be held to be correct or incorrect upon the basis of the results of the inspections and tests on such samples.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5111;53 Del. Laws, c. 187,\n\n§\n\n 3;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 31C;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5110. Investigations.The Secretary of Agriculture shall investigate complaints concerning violations of the provisions of this chapter, and shall, upon the Secretary of Agriculture’s own initiative, conduct such investigations as deemed appropriate and advisable to develop information on prevailing procedures in commercial quantity determination and on possible violations of the provisions of this chapter and to promote the general objective of accuracy in the determination and representation of quantity in commercial transactions.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5112;53 Del. Laws, c. 187,\n\n§\n\n 3;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 31C;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5111. Inspection of packages.The Secretary of Agriculture shall, as often as necessary to provide adequate protection, weigh or measure and inspect packages or amounts of commodities kept, offered, or exposed for sale, sold, or in the process of delivery, to determine whether the same contain the amounts represented and whether they be kept, offered, or exposed for sale, or sold, in accordance with law; and when such packages or amounts of commodities are found not to contain the amounts represented, or are found to be kept, offered, or exposed for sale in violation of law, the Secretary of Agriculture may order them off sale and may so mark or tag them as to show them to be illegal. In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Secretary of Agriculture may employ recognized sampling procedures under which the compliance of a given lot of packages will be determined on the basis of the result obtained on a sample selected from and representative of such lot. No person shall (1) sell, or keep, offer, or expose for sale in intrastate commerce any package or amount of commodity that has been ordered off sale or marked or tagged as provided in this section unless and until such package or amount of commodity has been brought into full compliance with all legal requirements, or (2) dispose of any package or amount of commodity that has been ordered off sale or marked or tagged as provided in this section and that has not been brought into compliance with legal requirements, in any manner except with the specific approval of the Secretary of Agriculture.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5113;53 Del. Laws, c. 187,\n\n§\n\n 3;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 31C;58 Del. Laws, c. 281,\n\n§\n\n 6;§\n\n5112. Stop-use, stop-removal, and removal orders.The Secretary of Agriculture shall have the power to issue stop-use orders, stop-removal orders, and removal orders with respect to weights and measures being, or susceptible of being, commercially used, and to issue stop-removal orders and removal orders with respect to packages or amounts of commodities kept, offered, or exposed for sale, sold, or in process of delivery, whenever in the course of enforcement of the provisions of this chapter the Secretary of Agriculture deems it necessary or expedient to issue such orders, and no person shall use, remove from the premises specified, or fail to remove from the premises specified any weight, measure, or package or amount of commodity contrary to the terms of a stop-use order, stop-removal order, or removal order issued under the authority of this section.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5114;53 Del. Laws, c. 187,\n\n§\n\n 3;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 31C;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5113. Disposition of correct and incorrect apparatus.The Secretary of Agriculture shall approve for use and seal or mark with appropriate devices such weights and measures found upon inspection and test to be “correct” as defined in § 5107 of this title, and shall reject and mark or tag as “rejected” such weights and measures found, upon inspection or test, to be “incorrect” as defined in § 5107 of this title, but which in the Secretary of Agriculture’s best judgment are susceptible of satisfactory repair; provided that, such sealing or marking shall not be required with respect to such weights and measures as may be exempted therefrom by a regulation of the Secretary of Agriculture issued under the authority of § 5107 of this title. The Secretary of Agriculture shall condemn, and may seize and may destroy, weights and measures found to be incorrect that, in the Secretary of Agriculture’s best judgment, are not susceptible of satisfactory repair. Weights and measures that have been rejected may be confiscated and may be destroyed by the Secretary of Agriculture if not corrected as required by § 5116 of this title, or if used or disposed of contrary to the requirements of § 5116 of this title.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5115;53 Del. Laws, c. 187,\n\n§\n\n 3;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 31C;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5114. Police powers; right of entry and stoppage.With respect to the enforcement of this chapter and any other chapters dealing with weights and measures that the Secretary of Agriculture is, or may be, empowered to enforce, the Secretary of Agriculture is hereby vested with police powers, and shall have police powers similar to those of constables and other police officers and may arrest any violator of the said chapters, and seize for use as evidence, incorrect or unsealed weights and measures or amounts or packages of commodity, found to be used, retained, offered or exposed for sale, or sold in violation of law. In the performance of official duties, the Secretary of Agriculture may enter and go into or upon, any structure or premises, and stop any person whatsoever and require that person to proceed, with or without any vehicle of which he or she may be in charge, to some place which the Secretary of Agriculture may specify.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5116;53 Del. Laws, c. 187,\n\n§\n\n 3;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 31C;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;78 Del. Laws, c. 266,\n\n§\n\n 11;§\n\n5115.

Duty of owners of incorrect apparatus.Weights and measures that have been rejected under the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture shall remain subject to the control of the rejecting authority until such time as suitable repair or disposition thereof has been made as required by this section. The owners of such rejected weights and measures shall cause the same to be made correct within 30 days or such longer period as may be authorized by the rejecting authority; or, in lieu of this, may dispose of the same, but only in such manner as is specifically authorized by the rejecting authority. Weights and measures that have been rejected shall not again be used commercially until they have been officially reexamined and found to be correct or until specific written permission for such use is issued by the rejecting authority or until the rejection tag has been removed and the rejected device repaired and placed in service by a person duly registered to perform such acts under a regulation issued by the Secretary for the registration of weights and measures, servicemen and service agencies.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5118;53 Del. Laws, c. 187,\n\n§\n\n 3;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 31C;58 Del. Laws, c. 281,\n\n§\n\n 7;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5117. Method of sale of commodities.Commodities in liquid form shall be sold only by liquid measure or by weight, and, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, commodities not in liquid form shall be sold only by weight, by measure of length or area, or by count; provided, that liquid commodities may be sold by weight and commodities not in liquid form may be sold by count only if such methods give accurate information as to the quantity of commodity sold; and provided further, that the provisions of this section shall not apply:(1) To commodities when sold for immediate consumption on the premises where sold,(2) To vegetables when sold by the head or bunch,(3) To commodities in containers standardized by a law of this State or by federal law,(4) To commodities in package form when there exists a general consumer usage to express the quantity in some other manner,(5) To concrete aggregates, concrete mixtures, and loose solid materials such as earth, soil, gravel, crushed stone, and the like, when sold by cubic measure, or(6) To unprocessed vegetable and animal fertilizer when sold by cubic measure.The Secretary of Agriculture, subject to the approval of the Department of Agriculture, may issue such reasonable regulations as are necessary to assure that amounts of commodity sold are determined in accordance with good commercial practice and are so determined and represented as to be accurate and informative to all parties at interest.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5119;53 Del. Laws, c. 187,\n\n§\n\n 3;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§§\n\n 31C, 31F;§\n\n5118. Packages; declarations of quantity and origin; variations; exemptions.Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any commodity in package form introduced or delivered for introduction into or received in intrastate commerce, kept for the purpose of sale, or offered or exposed for sale in intrastate commerce shall bear on the outside of the package a definite, plain, and conspicuous declaration of (1) the identity of the commodity in the package unless the same can easily be identified through the wrapper or container, (2) the net quantity of the contents in terms of weight, measure, or count, and (3) in the case of any package kept, offered, or exposed for sale, or sold any place other than on the premises where packed, the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as may be prescribed by regulation issued by the Secretary; provided, that in connection with the declaration required under clause (2), neither the qualifying term “when packed” or any words of similar import, nor any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count (for example, “jumbo,” “giant,” “full,” and the like) that tends to exaggerate the amount of commodity in a package, shall be used; and provided further, that under clause (2) the Secretary of Agriculture shall, by regulation, establish (a) reasonable variations to be allowed, which may include variations below the declared weight or measure caused by ordinary and customary exposure, only after the commodity is introduced into intrastate commerce, to conditions that normally occur in good distribution practice and that unavoidably result in decreased weight or measure, (b) exemptions as to small packages, and (c) exemptions as to commodities put up in variable weights or sizes for sale intact and either customarily not sold as individual units or customarily weighed or measured at time of sale to the consumer.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5120;53 Del. Laws, c. 187,\n\n§\n\n 3;57 Del. Laws, c. 764,\n\n§\n\n 31C;58 Del. Laws, c. 281,\n\n§§\n\n 8, 9;§\n\n5119.

Misrepresentation of price.Whenever any commodity or service is sold or is offered, exposed or advertised for sale, by weight, measure or count, the price shall not be misrepresented, nor shall the price be represented in any manner calculated or tending to mislead or deceive an actual or prospective purchaser. Whenever an advertised, posted or labeled price per unit of weight, measure or count includes a fraction of a cent, all elements of the fraction shall be prominently displayed and the numeral or numerals expressing the fraction shall be immediately adjacent to, of the same general design and style as and at least1/2the height and width of the numerals representing the whole cents. The procedures used for price verification shall be those recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the Examination Procedure for Price Verification in Handbook 130 and supplements thereto, or in any publication superseding these publications.6 Del.
