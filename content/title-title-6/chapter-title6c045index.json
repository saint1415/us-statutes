A notice under this paragraph (c)(3) must include, with specificity, the reasons for the Division’s determination.(d) Whenever the Division has reasonable cause to believe that a respondent has breached a conciliation agreement, the Division shall refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation that a civil action be filed under § 4512 of this title for the enforcement of such agreement.(e) If a complaint cannot be resolved through conciliation under subsection (c) of this section, the Commission shall appoint a panel to hold a public hearing within 60 days after the expiration of 120-day period for investigation and conciliation.

Such subpoenas shall be signed by the chairperson or panel chair and may be served by any sheriff, deputy sheriff, constable or any member of the Commission or employee of the Division and return thereof shall be made to the Commission. Such subpoenas and discovery may be ordered to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or discovery were ordered or served in aid of a civil action in the Superior Court. Provided, however, that such subpoenas and discovery in aid of investigations are first to be reviewed by the Attorney General to determine whether there is reason to believe that there has been a violation of this chapter.(b) At any public hearing, any member of the Commission may administer oaths to all witnesses who may be called before the Commission.(c) Witnesses summoned by a subpoena under this chapter shall be entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as witnesses in proceedings in Superior Court.(d) Where any person fails or neglects to attend and testify or answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents or other evidence, if it is in such person’s power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or other lawful order under subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General, on behalf of the Commission, shall petition the Superior Court in the county where such person resides or conducts business for an order requiring such person to appear before the Commission to produce evidence if so ordered or to give testimony pertaining to the matter under investigation or in question. Any failure to obey such order may be punished by the Court as being in contempt of court.(e)Criminal penalties. —(1) Any person who wilfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents or other evidence, if it is in such person’s power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or other lawful order under subsection (a) of this section, shall, in each instance be fined not more than $2,500 or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.(2) Any person who, with intent thereby to mislead another person in any proceeding under this chapter:a. Makes or causes to be made any false entry or statement of fact in any report, account, record or other document produced pursuant to subpoena or other lawful order under subsection (a) of this section;b. Wilfully neglects or fails to make or cause to be made full, true and correct entries in such reports, accounts, records or other documents; orc. Wilfully mutilates, alters or by any other means falsifies any documentary evidence; shall in each instance be fined not more than $2,500 or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.6 Del.

Judicial review.(a) Any party aggrieved by an order for relief under § 4508 of this title granting or denying, in whole or in part, the relief sought, may obtain a review of such order in the Superior Court in the county in which the discriminatory public accommodations practice is alleged to have occurred, pursuant to the civil rules of that Court and the Administrative Procedures Act [Chapter 101 of Title 29]. Filing of the petition for review shall be not later than 30 days after the order is entered.(b) Any party to the proceeding before the panel may intervene in the Superior Court in the appeal process.(c) No objection not made before the panel shall be considered by the Court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances or when the interests of justice so require.(d) If the Attorney General has not commenced a civil action within 60 days of notice of breach of a Commission order or conciliation agreement as authorized by § 4512 of this title, an aggrieved party may commence an action in the Superior Court, or Court of Chancery, or both, seeking enforcement and appropriate relief, including conversion of a Commission order conferring monetary relief to a judgment subject to execution. The Court may also award the aggrieved party reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees in connection with the enforcement action.6 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4511;54 Del. Laws, c. 181,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 350,\n\n§\n\n 1;75 Del. Laws, c. 356,\n\n§\n\n 16;§\n\n4512. Enforcement by the Attorney General.(a) Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaging in a pattern of discriminatory public accommodation practices, that any person or group of persons has been denied any of the rights granted by this chapter and such denial raises an issue of general public importance or that any party to a conciliation agreement has breached such agreement, the Attorney General may commence a civil action in the Superior Court, Court of Chancery or both in any county of the State for appropriate relief including, but not limited to, equitable relief, monetary damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses. To vindicate the public interest, the court may assess a civil penalty to be paid to the Special Administration Fund in an amount not exceeding $25,000 for a first violation of this section and in an amount not exceeding $50,000 for any subsequent violation of this section.(b) When a civil action is initiated by the Attorney General pursuant to this section, no Court shall charge fees of any kind in such proceeding to the Attorney General, the Commission or any of its members.6 Del.
