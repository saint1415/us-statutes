      "heading": "Short title.This chapter is to be known and may be cited as the “Delaware Wrongful Conviction Compensation and Services Act.”84 Del. Laws, c. 427,",
      "text": "§\n\n1;§\n\n7002. Declaration of purpose.The State recognizes that certain individuals have served sentences of incarceration, parole, probation, and sex offender registration in the State for crimes they did not commit, and that such individuals have been denied compensation for their wrongful convictions unless they can prove their wrongful incarceration was caused by official misconduct. The State believes that individuals who were innocent of the crimes for which they were convicted suffer long-term hardships as a result of their wrongful convictions, and are entitled to compensation for the sentences they wrongfully served, regardless of whether their convictions resulted from official misconduct. Therefore, this chapter provides compensation to individuals whose convictions have been overturned followed by either acquittal or dismissal of charges, and who are found to have been factually innocent of the crime or crimes at issue, for time that they served sentences due solely to the wrongful conviction.This chapter denies compensation to individuals who intentionally caused their convictions in order to prevent the convictions of the true perpetrators of the crimes at issue.The State recognizes that individuals whose convictions are overturned in most cases have been released from prison without any reintegration services, even those services that are routinely provided to releasees whose convictions have not been overturned. The State finds that this lack of services unjustly hampers the ability of these individuals to reintegrate into society. Accordingly, this chapter provides reintegration services to such individuals.84 Del. Laws, c. 427,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n7003. Definitions.When used in this chapter:(1) “Conviction” means as defined under § 222 of Title 11. “Conviction” also includes a case in which a person is adjudicated delinquent under § 1002 of this title.(2) “Defendant” means a defendant in a criminal case or a respondent in a juvenile delinquency case.(3) “Heirs” means the executor or administrator of a decedent’s estate, the decedent’s personal representatives, or both.(4) “Incarceration,” in addition to its ordinary meaning, means any of the following:a. Imprisonment in a Department of Correction facility.b. Involuntary confinement in the Delaware Psychiatric Center.c. Placement in the custody of the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families.d. Pretrial detention.(5) “Petitioner” means the individual claiming wrongful conviction and, if that individual is deceased, the individual’s heirs. In petitions brought by heirs, the term “petitioner” also means the deceased individual who claimed wrongful conviction where it is used to describe the petitioner’s prosecution, the petitioner’s conviction, the petitioner’s sentence, settlements by and civil awards to the petitioner, and the petitioner’s costs for reintegrative services, mental health care, or physical health care.84 Del. Laws, c. 427,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n7004. Cause of action against the State for wrongful conviction.(a) Who may bring. —An individual claiming wrongful conviction, or the heirs of the individual if the individual is deceased, may bring a petition for an award and other relief against the State, as set forth in this section.(b) Filing and service. —The petition must be filed in the Superior Court.
