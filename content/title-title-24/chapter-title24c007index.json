A report of the applicant’s entire federal criminal history record pursuant to the Federal Bureau of Investigation appropriation of Title II of Public Law 92-544 (28 U.S.C. § 534). The State Bureau of Identification shall be the intermediary for purposes of this section and the Board of Chiropractic shall be the screening point for the receipt of said federal criminal history records.c. An applicant may not be licensed to practice chiropractic until the applicant’s criminal history reports have been produced. An applicant whose record shows a prior criminal conviction related to the practice of chiropractic may not be licensed by the Board unless a waiver is granted pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this section.(b) An applicant, who has received a degree of “Doctor of Chiropractic” or its equivalent from a foreign school, college or university, shall submit a certified copy of the applicant’s school, college or university record for evaluation by the Board.(c) Where the Board has found to its satisfaction that an applicant has been intentionally fraudulent, or that false information has been intentionally supplied, it shall report its findings to the Attorney General for further action.(d) Where the application of a person has been refused or rejected and such applicant feels that the Board has acted without justification; has imposed higher or different standards for the applicant than for other applicants or licensees; or has in some other manner contributed to or caused the failure of such application, the applicant may appeal to the Superior Court.(e) All individuals licensed to practice chiropractic in this State shall be required to be fingerprinted by the State Bureau of Identification, at the licensee’s expense, for the purposes of performing subsequent criminal background checks. Licensees shall submit by January 1, 2016, at the applicant’s expense, fingerprints and other necessary information in order to obtain a criminal background check.41 Del.

This paragraph shall not apply to chiropractic positions held by chiropractors employed by or contracted with a Delaware licensed medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy that works in the State a minimum of 10 hours per week. It will also not apply to any Delaware-licensed hospitals. The estate of a licensed chiropractor shall have 1 year to divest of the chiropractic business.(c) Where a practitioner fails to comply with the Board’s request that the practitioner attend a hearing, the Board may petition the Superior Court to order such attendance, and the said Court or any judge assigned thereto shall have the jurisdiction to issue such order.(d) Subject to subchapter IV of Chapter 101 of Title 29, no license shall be restricted, suspended or revoked by the Board; and no practitioner’s right to practice shall be limited by the Board, until such practitioner has been given notice, and an opportunity to be heard in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act [Chapter 101 of Title 29].(e) The Board may impose any of the following sanctions, partially, singly or in combination, when it finds that 1 of the conditions or violations set forth in subsection (b) of this section applies to a practitioner regulated under this chapter:(1) Restrict the license of a practitioner;(2) Publicly censure a practitioner;(3) Issue a public letter of reprimand;(4) Place a practitioner on probationary status, and require the practitioner to:a. Report regularly to the Board upon the matters which are the basis for the probation;b. Limit all practice and professional activities to those areas prescribed by the Board; and/orc. Continue or renew the practitioner’s professional education until the required degree of skill has been attained in those areas which are the basis of the probation;(5) Suspend any practitioner’s license;(6) Revoke a practitioner’s license; or(7) The Board shall permanently revoke the license to practice chiropractic of a person who is convicted of a felony sexual offense.(f) The Board may withdraw or reduce conditions of probation when it finds that the deficiencies which required such action have been remedied.(g) Where the Board has placed a practitioner on probationary status under certain restrictions or conditions, and the Board has determined that such restrictions or conditions are being or have been violated by the practitioner it may, after a hearing on the matter, suspend or revoke the practitioner’s license.(h) In the event of a formal or informal complaint concerning the activity of a licensee that presents a clear and immediate danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the Board may temporarily suspend the person’s license, pending a hearing, upon the written order of the Secretary of State or the Secretary’s designee, with the concurrence of the Board chair or the Board chair’s designee. An order temporarily suspending a license may not be issued unless the person or the person’s attorney received at least 24 hours’ written or oral notice before the temporary suspension so that the person or the person’s attorney may file a written response to the proposed suspension. The decision as to whether to issue the temporary order of suspension will be decided on the written submissions. An order of temporary suspension pending a hearing may remain in effect for no longer than 60 days from the date of the issuance of the order unless the temporarily suspended person requests a continuance of the hearing date. If the temporarily suspended person requests a continuance, the order of temporary suspension remains in effect until the hearing is convened and a decision is rendered by the Board. A person whose license has been temporarily suspended pursuant to this section may request an expedited hearing. The Board shall schedule the hearing on an expedited basis, provided that the Board receives the request within 5 calendar days from the date on which the person received notification of the decision to temporarily suspend the person’s license.(i) As a condition to reinstatement of a suspended license, or removal from probationary status, the Board may impose such disciplinary or corrective measures as are authorized under this chapter.41 Del.
