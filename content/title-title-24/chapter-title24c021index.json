Definition of practice of optometry.(a) “Practice of optometry” means the examination or measurement by any subjective or objective means including automated or testing devices for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of conditions of the human eye, lid, adnexa, and visual system as outlined below.(1) “Practice of optometry” includes all of the following:a. Use, adapting, and fitting of all types of lenses or devices except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.b. Dispensing of any type of contact lenses that must be dispensed in accordance with a written, current contact lens prescription from a licensed physician or optometrist, including information that the Board may specify by rule or regulation.c. Determination of refractive error or visual, muscular, or anatomical anomalies of the eye.d. Provision or prescription of vision therapy, low-vision rehabilitation, or developmental or perceptual therapy.(2) A license to practice optometry includes the utilization of any method or means which the optometrist is educationally qualified to provide, as established by the Delaware State Board of Examiners in Optometry and:a. Includes performance of minor procedures on the surface of the skin of the ocular adnexa, of the cornea and conjunctiva of the globe and lid that can be performed safely with topical anesthesia and that would not require the use of injections or penetration of the globe, and the cutting or closure of human tissue by suture or staple, glue, adhesive, soldering, or cauterization. Also excludes anterior corneal stromal puncture, collagen cross-linking, postsurgical pterygium or conjuctival graft gluing of amniotic membranes, mechanical polishing of the corneal basement membrane, or any procedure that requires full- or partial-thickness incision of the sclera or cornea. Such minor procedures include: removal of superficial foreign body of the external eye conjunctiva; removal of conjunctival nonperforating foreign bodies; removal of a foreign body with or without slit lamp; superficial corneal scraping for diagnostic purposes; epilation of trichiasis by forceps; expression of conjunctival follicles; closure of lacrimal punctum by plug; intense pulsed light therapy; thermal treatment of eyelid margin for dry eye and blepharitis such as Lipiflow; and dilation of lacrimal punctum, with or without irrigation except on infant and toddler patients.b. Prohibits surgery.c. Prohibits the use of ophthalmic lasers or other modalities in which tissue is burned, vaporized, cut, or otherwise irreversibly altered by thermal, light-based, electromagnetic, radiation, chemical, ultrasound, infusion, cryotherapy, or similar means, excluding the use of pharmaceutical agents described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.d. Procedures must meet the standard of care as if performed by a physician.(3) “Practice of optometry,” as it relates to pharmaceutical agents, means as follows:a. Includes the use of pharmaceutical agents for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions of the eye and adnexa based on the licensing requirement that satisfies the requirement for graduate level coursework that includes general and ocular pharmacology as follows:1. Prescription for controlled substances.A. Schedule II controlled substances containing Hydrocodone, with a limitation on maximum 72-hour supply.B. Schedules III, IV, and V controlled substances, with a limitation on maximum 72-hour supply.2. Prescription for the use of an oral steroid with a limitation not to exceed a single 6-day methylprednisolone dose pack.b. Includes the use of an epinephrine auto-injector to counteract anaphylaxis.c. Excludes prescription for oral immuno-suppressives except for the use of oral steroids under § 2101(a)(3)a.2. of this title.d. Excludes the prescription of oral antifungals.e. Excludes the prescription of oral antimetabolites.f. Excludes the prescription of any substance delivered intravenously or by injection.g. Excludes any medication used solely for the treatment of systemic conditions outside the scope of an optometrist.(b) For purposes of this chapter, the term “diagnostically certified optometrists” applies only to those currently licensed in the category and if that license lapses, the licensee could only relicense by meeting current licensing requirements in § 2107 of this title. The duties of a nondiagnostically certified optometrist are limited to those that do not utilize therapeutic pharmaceutical agents or perform procedures that require subsequent treatment with therapeutic pharmaceutical agents.(c) In administering this chapter, the State Board shall, by rule or regulation, specify those acts, services, procedures and practices which constitute the “practice of optometry” within the definitions of this section and consistent with having submitted proof of graduate level coursework that includes general and ocular pharmacology.(d) For purposes of disability insurance, workers’ compensation, standard health and accident, sickness and other insurance policies, programs and plans, if the optometrist is authorized by law to perform the particular services, the optometrist shall be entitled to compensation for services under the said programs. Individuals entitled to such services shall have freedom to choose between any optometrist and any physician skilled in diseases of the eye.(e) [Repealed.]25 Del.

Grounds for refusal, revocation or suspension of licenses.(a) A practitioner licensed under this chapter shall be subject to disciplinary actions set forth in § 2115 of this title if, after a hearing, the Board finds that the optometrist has:(1) Practiced in a merchandising store;(2) Practiced in an office not exclusively devoted to the practice of optometry or other health care profession, where material or merchandise is displayed pertaining to a business or commercial undertaking not bearing any relation to the practice of optometry or other health care profession or practicing in a store or office which does not conform to that used by the majority of professional optometrists in the area;(3) Continued in the employ of, or acted as an assistant to, any person, firm or corporation, either directly or indirectly, after the optometrist has knowledge that such person, firm or corporation is violating the laws of Delaware concerning the practice of optometry;(4) Solicited in person or through an agent or agents for the purpose of selling ophthalmic materials or optometric services which involves any form of kickback arrangement or where financial remuneration or payment in kind is made to a nonpractitioner to induce referral business from that nonpractitioner;(5) Caused or permitted the use of that optometrist’s name, profession or professional title by or in conjunction with any association, company, corporation or unlicensed person in any advertising of any manner, unless in conjunction with a vision service plan approved by the Board;(6) Practiced for or in conjunction with, either directly or indirectly, a corporation or company, except that allowed under Chapter 6 of Title 8; provided, that the foregoing shall not prevent a person licensed pursuant to this chapter from rendering optometric services at a nonprofit clinic which is operated by a corporation or company that is affiliated with a hospital licensed by the Department of Health and Social Services and accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Organizations (JCAH) or the American Osteopathic Association;(7) Employed or knowingly cooperated in fraud or material deception in order to acquire a license as an optometrist; has impersonated another person holding a license or allowed another person to use that optometrist’s license; or aided or abetted a person not licensed as an optometrist to represent oneself as an optometrist;(8) Been convicted of a crime that is substantially related to the practice of optometry. “Substantially related” means the nature of the criminal conduct, for which the person was convicted, has a direct bearing on the fitness or ability to perform 1 or more of the duties or responsibilities necessarily related to the practice of optometry. A copy of the record of conviction certified by the clerk of the court entering the conviction shall be conclusive evidence therefor; however, after a hearing or review of documentation and consideration of the factors set forth in § 8735(x)(3) of Title 29, the Board, by an affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum, shall waive this paragraph (a)(8) if it finds that granting a waiver would not create an unreasonable risk to public safety;a.-d. [Repealed.](9) Excessively used or abused drugs (including alcohol, narcotics or chemicals);(10) Engaged in an act of consumer fraud or deception; engaged in the restraint of competition; or participated in price-fixing activities;(11) Had that optometrist’s license, certification or registration as an optometrist suspended or revoked or other disciplinary action taken by the appropriate licensing authority in another jurisdiction; provided, however, that the underlying grounds for such action in another jurisdiction have been presented to the Board by certified record, and the Board has determined that the facts found by the appropriate authority in the other jurisdiction constitute 1 or more of the acts defined in this chapter. Every person licensed as an optometrist in this State shall be deemed to have given consent to the release of this information by the Board of Examiners in Optometry, or other comparable agencies in another jurisdiction, and to waive all objections to the admissibility of previously adjudicated evidence of such acts or offenses;(12) Failed to notify the Board that the optometrist’s license, certification or registration as an optometrist in another state has been subject to discipline or has been surrendered, suspended or revoked. A certified copy of the record of disciplinary action, surrender, suspension or revocation shall be conclusive evidence thereof;(13) Engaged in illegal, negligent or unethical conduct in the practice of optometry; or(14) Violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation of the Board.(b) Where a practitioner fails to comply with the Board’s request that the practitioner attend a hearing, the Board may petition the Superior Court to order such attendance, and the said Court or any judge assigned thereto shall have the jurisdiction to issue such order.(c) Subject to this chapter and Chapter 101 of Title 29, no license shall be restricted, suspended or revoked by the Board and no practitioner’s right to practice optometry shall be limited by the Board until such practitioner has been given notice and an opportunity to be heard, in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act [Chapter 101 of Title 29].25 Del.

Complaints.All complaints shall be received and investigated by the Division of Professional Regulation in accordance with § 8735 of Title 29 and the Division shall be responsible for issuing a final written report at the conclusion of its investigation.When it is determined that an individual is engaging in the practice of optometry or is using the title “optometrist” and is not licensed under the laws of this State, the Board shall apply to the office of the Attorney General to issue a cease and desist order after formally warning the unlicensed practitioner in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.Any complaints involving allegations of unprofessional conduct or incompetence shall be investigated by the Division of Professional Regulation.70 Del. Laws, c. 546,\n\n§\n\n 22;§\n\n2115. Disciplinary sanctions.(a) The Board may impose any of the following sanctions, singly or in combination, when it finds that 1 of the conditions or violations set forth in § 2113 of this title applies to a practitioner regulated by this chapter:(1) Issue a letter of reprimand;(2) Publicly censure a practitioner;(3) Place a practitioner on probationary status and require the practitioner to:a. Report regularly to the Board upon the matters which are the basis of the probation; andb. Limit all practice and professional activities to those areas prescribed by the Board;(4) Suspend any practitioner’s license;(5) Revoke any practitioner’s license;(6) Impose a monetary penalty not to exceed $500 for each violation in addition to suspension or revocation of a license; and/or(7) The Board shall permanently revoke the license to practice optometry of a person who is convicted of a felony sexual offense.(b) The Board may withdraw or reduce conditions of probation when it finds that the deficiencies which required such action have been remedied.(c) In the event of a formal or informal complaint concerning the activity of a licensee that presents a clear and immediate danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the Board may temporarily suspend the person’s license, pending a hearing, upon the written order of the Secretary of State or the Secretary’s designee, with the concurrence of the Board chair or the Board chair’s designee. An order temporarily suspending a license may not be issued unless the person or the person’s attorney received at least 24 hours’ written or oral notice before the temporary suspension so that the person or the person’s attorney may file a written response to the proposed suspension. The decision as to whether to issue the temporary order of suspension will be decided on the written submissions. An order of temporary suspension pending a hearing may remain in effect for no longer than 60 days from the date of the issuance of the order unless the temporarily suspended person requests a continuance of the hearing date. If the temporarily suspended person requests a continuance, the order of temporary suspension remains in effect until the hearing is convened and a decision is rendered by the Board. A person whose license has been temporarily suspended pursuant to this section may request an expedited hearing. The Board shall schedule the hearing on an expedited basis, provided that the Board receives the request within 5 calendar days from the date on which the person received notification of the decision to temporarily suspend the person’s license.(d) Where a license has been suspended due to a disability of the licensee, the Board may reinstate such license if, after a hearing, the Board is satisfied that the licensee is able to practice with reasonable skill and safety.(e) As a condition to reinstatement of a suspended license or removal from probationary status, the Board may impose such disciplinary or corrective measures as are authorized under this chapter.70 Del. Laws, c. 546,\n\n§\n\n 23;79 Del. Laws, c. 213,\n\n§\n\n 2;79 Del. Laws, c. 277,\n\n§\n\n 8;§\n\n2116. Hearing procedures.(a) If a complaint is filed with the Board pursuant to § 8735 of Title 29, alleging violation of § 2115 of this chapter, the Board shall set a time and place to conduct a hearing on the complaint. Notice of the hearing shall be given and the hearing conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act, Chapter 101 of Title 29.(b) All hearings shall be informal without use of rules of evidence. If the Board finds by a majority vote of all members that the complaint has merit, the Board shall take such action permitted under this chapter as it deems necessary. The Board’s decision shall be in writing and shall include its reasons for such decision. The Board’s decision shall be mailed immediately to the practitioner.(c) Where the practitioner is in disagreement with the action of the Board, that practitioner may appeal the Board’s decision to the Superior Court within 30 days of service or of the postmarked date of the copy of the decision mailed to the practitioner. Upon such appeal the Court shall hear the evidence on the record. Stays shall be granted in accordance with § 10144 of Title 29.70 Del. Laws, c. 546,\n\n§\n\n 30;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2117. Reinstatement of a suspended license; removal from probationary status.(a) As a condition to reinstatement of a suspended license or removal from probationary status, the Board may reinstate such license if, after a hearing, the Board is satisfied that the licensee or registrant has taken the prescribed corrective actions and otherwise satisfied all of the conditions of the suspension and/or the probation.(b) Where a license has been suspended due to the licensee’s inability to practice pursuant to this chapter, the Board may reinstate such license if, after a hearing, the Board is satisfied that the licensee is again able to perform the essential functions of an optometrist, with or without reasonable accommodations and/or there is no longer a significant risk of substantial harm to the health and safety of the individual or others.(c) Applicants for reinstatement must pay the appropriate fees and submit documentation required by the Board as evidence that all the conditions of a suspension and/or probation have been met. Proof that the applicant has met the continuing education requirements of this chapter may also be required, as appropriate.(d) [Repealed.]70 Del. Laws, c. 546,\n\n§\n\n 30;82 Del.
