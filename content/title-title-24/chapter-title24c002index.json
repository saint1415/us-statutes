Such written examination shall be obtained from, and corrected by, the National Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards, or similar national testing service. Where an applicant has failed to pass the examination, but has successfully completed or passed certain portions or sections which the applicant previously failed, the applicant shall be permitted to retake only those certain portions or sections of the examination the applicant has failed, if the testing service permits such partial examination. In the event the applicant fails the second time to successfully complete or pass the examination, the Board may require that such applicant again take the complete examination.(b) In the event an applicant has already taken and passed the uniform national examination, the certificate from the National Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards acknowledging same shall be accepted, and no further state examination shall be necessary.60 Del.

Upon receipt of an application for reciprocity, the Board shall contact each board which has previously licensed the applicant, to determine whether or not there are disciplinary proceedings or unresolved complaints pending against the applicant. In the event there is a disciplinary proceeding or unresolved complaint pending, the applicant shall not be licensed until the proceeding or complaint has been resolved. An application for licensure by reciprocity shall be accompanied by full payment of the reciprocity fee.60 Del. Laws, c. 190,\n\n§\n\n 1;63 Del. Laws, c. 461,\n\n§\n\n 8;67 Del.

The Board shall charge for each month or quarter during such “late renewal period” a late fee which, at the end of such “late period” will be twice the sum of the unpaid renewal fee. At the expiration of the period designated by the Board, the license shall be deemed to be lapsed and not renewable unless the former licensee reapplies under the same conditions which govern reciprocity; provided, however, that the former licensee shall also pay a reinstatement fee in an amount which is 3 times the amount of the reciprocity fee.(c) Any licensee may, upon a written request, be placed in an inactive status. The renewal fee of such person shall be prorated in accordance with the amount of time such person was inactive. Such person may reenter practice upon notification to the Board of the intent to do so.(d) A former licensee who has been penalized for the violation of a provision of this chapter, or whose license has been suspended or revoked, and who subsequently is permitted to apply for reinstatement shall apply for a new license, successfully complete the uniform national examination and shall pay all appropriate fees therefor.60 Del. Laws, c. 190,\n\n§\n\n 1;63 Del. Laws, c. 461,\n\n§\n\n 10;65 Del. Laws, c. 355,\n\n§\n\n 1;67 Del. Laws, c. 385,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;74 Del. Laws, c. 336,\n\n§\n\n 5;80 Del.

A certificate of authorization shall be renewed biennially in such manner as is determined by the Division, and upon payment of the appropriate fee and submission of a renewal form provided by the Division. In the event there should be a change in the information provided on the application for a certificate of authorization, notification of such change shall be provided to the Board in writing within 30 days of the effective date of such change.(d) No such business entity shall be relieved of responsibility for the conduct or acts of its agents, employees, officers, partners, members or principals by reason of its compliance with this section, nor shall any individual be relieved of responsibility for landscape architectural services performed by reason of employment or relationship with such business entity.

Grounds for discipline; procedure.(a) Practitioners regulated under this chapter shall be subject to those disciplinary actions set forth in § 214 of this title if, after a hearing, the Board finds:(1) That the practitioner has employed or knowingly cooperated in fraud or material deception in order to be licensed, or be otherwise authorized to practice landscape architecture;(2) Illegal, incompetent or negligent conduct in the practice of landscape architecture;(3) Excessive use or abuse of drugs (including alcohol, narcotics or chemicals);(4) That the practitioner has been convicted of a crime that is substantially related to the practice of landscape architecture;(5) That the practitioner, as a landscape architect or otherwise in the practice of the profession, knowingly engaged in an act of consumer fraud or deception, engaged in the restraint of competition or participated in price-fixing activities;(6) That the practitioner has violated a lawful provision of this chapter, or any lawful regulation established thereunder.(b) A practitioner shall be subject to nondisciplinary remedial action if, after a hearing, the Board finds that there is a danger to the health, safety and welfare of the public due to:(1) Physical illness or loss of motor skill, including but not limited to deterioration through the aging process;(2) Temporary emotional disorder or mental illness; or(3) Permanent emotional disorder or mental illness.(c) If a practitioner’s physical or mental capacity to practice safely is at issue in a nondisciplinary remedial proceeding, the Board may order the practitioner to submit to a reasonable physical or mental examination. Failure to comply with a lawful order to submit to a physical or mental examination shall render a practitioner liable to temporary suspension or revocation of license in accordance with § 214 of this title.(d) Where a practitioner fails to comply with the Board’s request that the practitioner submit to an examination or attending a hearing, the Board may petition the Superior Court to order such examination or attendance, and the said Court or any judge assigned thereto shall have jurisdiction to issue such order.(e) Subject to subchapter IV of Chapter 101 of Title 29, no license shall be restricted, suspended or revoked by the Board; and no practitioner’s right to practice shall be limited by the Board, until such practitioner has been given notice, and an opportunity to be heard in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act [29 Del. C. § 10101 et seq.].60 Del. Laws, c. 190,\n\n§\n\n 1;63 Del. Laws, c. 461,\n\n§\n\n 13;67 Del. Laws, c. 385,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;74 Del. Laws, c. 262,\n\n§\n\n 8;§\n\n214. Disciplinary sanctions.(a) The Board may impose any of the following sanctions, singly or in combination, when it finds that one of the conditions or violations set forth in § 213 of this title applies to a practitioner regulated by this chapter:(1) Issue a letter of reprimand;(2) Censure a practitioner;(3) Place a practitioner on probationary status, and require the practitioner to:a. Report regularly to the Board upon the matters which are the basis of the probation;b. Limit all practice and professional activities to those areas prescribed by the Board; and/orc. Continue or renew the practitioner’s professional education until the required degree of skill has been attained in those areas which are the basis of the probation;(4) Suspend any practitioner’s license;(5) Revoke any practitioner’s license.(b) The Board may withdraw or reduce conditions of probation when it finds that the deficiencies which required such action have been remedied.(c) In the event of a formal or informal complaint concerning the activity of a licensee that presents a clear and immediate danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the Board may temporarily suspend the person’s license, pending a hearing, upon the written order of the Secretary of State or the Secretary’s designee, with the concurrence of the Board chair or the Board chair’s designee. An order temporarily suspending a license may not be issued unless the person or the person’s attorney received at least 24 hours’ written or oral notice before the temporary suspension so that the person or the person’s attorney may file a written response to the proposed suspension. The decision as to whether to issue the temporary order of suspension will be decided on the written submissions. An order of temporary suspension pending a hearing may remain in effect for no longer than 60 days from the date of the issuance of the order unless the temporarily suspended person requests a continuance of the hearing date. If the temporarily suspended person requests a continuance, the order of temporary suspension remains in effect until the hearing is convened and a decision is rendered by the Board. A person whose license has been temporarily suspended pursuant to this section may request an expedited hearing. The Board shall schedule the hearing on an expedited basis, provided that the Board receives the request within 5 calendar days from the date on which the person received notification of the decision to temporarily suspend the person’s license.(d) Where a license has been suspended due to a disability of the licensee, the Board may reinstate such license if, after a hearing, the Board is satisfied that the licensee is able to practice with reasonable skill and safety.(e) As a condition to reinstatement of a suspended license, or removal from probationary status, the Board may impose such disciplinary or corrective measures as are authorized under this chapter.60 Del.

Where the Board has determined to take further action, the matter shall be heard by the Board within 3 months from the date on which the complaint was received. The Board shall fix the time and place for a full hearing of the matter, and shall cause a copy of the complaint, together with a notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing, to be personally delivered or served upon the practitioner at least 30 days before the date fixed for the hearing. In cases where the practitioner cannot be located or where personal service cannot be effected, substitute service shall be effected in the same manner as with civil litigation.(b) All hearings shall be informal without use of the rules of evidence. If the Board finds, by a majority vote of all members, that the complaint has merit, the Board shall take such action permitted under this chapter as it deems necessary. The Board’s decision shall be in writing and shall include its reasons for such decision. A copy of the decision shall be mailed immediately to the practitioner. The Board’s decision shall become effective on the thirtieth day after the date it is mailed or served on the practitioner, unless there is an appeal by the practitioner to the Superior Court within that time.60 Del.

Practicing without a license; penalties.(a) Where the Board has determined that a person is practicing landscape architecture within the State without having lawfully obtained a license therefor, or that a person previously licensed is unlawfully practicing although the person’s license has been suspended or revoked, the Board shall formally warn such person. If the offense continues, the Board shall make a formal complaint to the Attorney General. The complaint shall include all evidence known to, or in the possession of, the Board.(b) Where the Board has placed a practitioner on probationary status under certain restrictions or conditions, and the Board has determined that such restrictions or conditions are being or have been violated by the practitioner, it may, after a hearing on the matter, suspend or revoke the practitioner’s license.(c) Where a person not currently licensed as a landscape architect is convicted of unlawfully practicing landscape architecture in violation of this chapter such offender shall, upon the first offense, be fined $50, and shall pay all costs; provided, however, that where it is alleged that such violation has resulted in injury to any person, the offender shall be charged and tried under the applicable provisions of Title 11.(d) Where a person previously convicted of unlawfully practicing landscape architecture is convicted a second or subsequent time of such offense, the fine assessed against such person shall be increased by $250 for each subsequent offense thereafter.60 Del.
