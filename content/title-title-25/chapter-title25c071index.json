Notice requirements.(a)Preliminary notice period. —Any owner of real estate on which a manufactured home community is located who wishes to convert such property to multiple-unit usage shall provide a written preliminary notice to each tenant, and to the tenants’ association, if 1 is in existence, of the owner’s intention to convert the property. The preliminary notice shall not constitute, nor shall it include, a notice to the tenant to terminate the tenant’s tenancy. Such preliminary notice shall also notify each tenant of the following:(1) That there is a mandatory 3-year grace period prior to eviction;(2) That the tenants’ association has the exclusive option to purchase that portion of the community which the owner proposes to convert, and must, within 90 days from the date it receives the preliminary notice, and the separate writing described in § 7108(a) of this title, notify the owner of its intent to exercise its option;(3) That if the tenants’ association decides not to exercise its option, upon the expiration of the 90-day period, the option shall convert into a right of first refusal meaning that the property shall not be sold to any other purchaser, at any time, at any price or terms without first having been offered on the same terms to the tenants’ association;(4) That no tenant shall be evicted prior to the expiration of the 3-year grace period, except for the following causes:a. Nonpayment of rent; orb. Violation of a material provision of the lease.(b)Grace period. —After the expiration of 90 days from the date of the preliminary notice or filing of the conversion plan with the Recorder of Deeds, whichever is later, the owner may give final notice to each tenant that the tenant must vacate the premises at the end of the 3-year period, unless the tenant comes within any of the exceptions set forth in this section and § 7111 of this title. From the time of the delivery of the final notice, each tenant shall have a 3-year grace period before the owner may institute legal action for eviction. In any instance where a tenant’s lease is for a period of time which extends beyond the expiration date as set forth in the final notice, the grace period shall continue until expiration of such tenant’s lease.(c) Final notice. —The final notice shall contain a provision stating that each tenant in occupancy at the time of the preliminary notice shall have the exclusive right to purchase a unit in the proposed conversion project, and that such exclusive right to purchase shall continue through the first 90 days after the waiver or termination by the tenants’ association of its option, and for such additional time thereafter as the owner shall permit. A copy of the final notice shall also be mailed or delivered to the tenants’ association, if such association was in being at the time of the preliminary notice. The final notice shall contain a provision that any person who is a tenant of the manufactured home community, and who elects to purchase a unit in the conversion project, shall not be required to pay more for any unit than the price set forth in the conversion plan, nor more than any other person purchasing the same type of unit. The final notice shall not constitute, nor shall it include, a notice to the tenant to immediately terminate the tenant’s tenancy.64 Del. Laws, c. 14,\n\n§\n\n 2;74 Del. Laws, c. 35,\n\n§\n\n 8;84 Del. Laws, c. 42,\n\n§\n\n122;§\n\n7106. Approval by Attorney General.No conversion of real property on which a manufactured home community is situated shall be lawful unless such conversion has received the approval of the Attorney General after a thorough review the conversion plan to determine compliance with this chapter. Where the Attorney General has not acted to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove a conversion plan or prospective conversion within 90 days after receipt of the conversion plan, the conversion plan or prospective conversion shall be deemed to have been approved; provided, however, that the provisions of § 7103 of this title are mandatory, and cannot be waived. The Attorney General may, by a writing addressed to the owner, suspend the Attorney General’s decision for an additional 30 days. When the conversion plan is approved, no provision of the plan shall be changed without the written approval of the Attorney General.64 Del. Laws, c. 14,\n\n§\n\n 2;74 Del. Laws, c. 35,\n\n§\n\n 8;84 Del. Laws, c. 42,\n\n§\n\n123;§\n\n7107. Extension and termination of leases.(a) Any tenant at the time of the preliminary notice grace period shall be entitled to have the tenant’s lease extended, on the same terms and conditions as the immediately preceding lease, until the expiration of the grace period. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the owner from increasing rent pursuant to § 7110(d) of this title.(b) After receipt of the final notice, and upon 30 days’ written notice to the owner, a tenant may without penalty terminate the tenant’s existing lease; provided, however, that the owner shall receive a full month’s rent for any partial month of tenancy.64 Del. Laws, c. 14,\n\n§\n\n 2;84 Del. Laws, c. 42,\n\n§\n\n124;§\n\n7108. Option to purchase; right of first refusal; rescission of contract to purchase; nonpurchasing tenant with children attending school.(a) Where there is a tenants’ association in existence at the time of the preliminary notice, the owners of the real property which is to be converted shall in a separate writing mailed to the association, upon approval of the plan by the Office of the Attorney General, grant to the association the exclusive option to purchase the community for a period of 90 days at the price set forth in the plan. If the tenants’ association should exercise its option, it shall have 120 days from the date of its exercise of its option to complete the purchase. If the tenants’ association decides not to exercise its options, upon the expiration of the 90-day period, the option shall convert into a right of first refusal meaning that the property shall not be sold to any other purchaser, at any time, at any price or terms, without first having been offered on the same terms to the tenants’ association.(b) Should the tenants’ association fail to exercise its option to purchase within the 90-day period, the owner shall grant to the tenant the exclusive option to purchase the unit for a period of 90 days thereafter at the price set forth in the plan. Upon the request of a tenant, the owner shall provide the tenant with a listing of the types of units within the conversion project, and the price for each type of unit. If the tenant should exercise that tenant’s option, that tenant shall have 120 days from the date of the exercise of that tenant’s option to complete the purchase. If the tenant decides not to exercise that tenant’s option, upon the expiration of the 90-day period, the option shall convert into a right of first refusal, meaning that the property shall not be sold to any other purchaser at any time, at any price or terms without first having been offered on the same terms to the tenant.(c) For a period of 60 days after a purchasing tenant has agreed in writing to purchase a unit within the conversion project, such tenant shall have the right to rescind such contract without the imposition of any penalty or fee. If the tenant rescinds, any renegotiation or new agreement signed by the owner and the purchasing tenant shall be valid and binding, if such renegotiation occurs between the time of rescission and the expiration of the 60-day period set forth in this subsection.(d) Where the 3-year grace period has expired and a nonpurchasing tenant with children still attending school has failed to move, such tenant shall be permitted to remain until 1 week following the end of the school year; or if any of the children is about to graduate, 1 week after the graduation ceremony; whichever is later.64 Del. Laws, c. 14,\n\n§\n\n 2;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;74 Del. Laws, c. 35,\n\n§\n\n 8;§\n\n7109. Rights of nonpurchasing tenants.(a) All manufactured home sites occupied by nonpurchasing tenants shall be managed by the same manager or agent who manages all other units in the manufactured home community. The owner shall provide to nonpurchasing tenants all services and facilities required by law on a nondiscriminatory basis. The owner shall guarantee such obligation of the manager or agent to provide all such services and facilities for each tenant until such time as the tenant no longer resides on the premises. This obligation will be the obligation of the tenants’ association if it exercises its right of first refusal and purchases the community.(b) Where an owner has given notice of that owner’s intent to convert a manufactured home community, each tenant who has not purchased a unit in the proposed conversion project shall, during the remaining term of the rental agreement and any extension thereof, be entitled to the same rights, privileges and services that were enjoyed by tenants prior to the date of the preliminary notice together with those that are granted, offered or provided to purchasers or prospective purchasers of the conversion project.64 Del. Laws, c. 14,\n\n§\n\n 2;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;74 Del. Laws, c. 35,\n\n§\n\n 8;§\n\n7110. Rights of tenant during conversion.(a) After the filing of a conversion plan, during the grace period, no owner may evict or fail to renew the lease of a tenant of a manufactured home community which is the site of a proposed conversion; provided, however, that eviction proceedings may be commenced for nonpayment of rent or a similar breach by a tenant of a contractual obligation to the owner.(b) The prices, terms and conditions offered to tenants by the owner for the purchase of a unit within the conversion project shall be the same as, or more favorable than, those set forth in the conversion plan and those offered to the general public.(c) Any tenant who has left the manufactured home community or is about to do so because the owner or the owner’s agents are substantially interfering with the tenant’s comfort, peace or quiet contrary to the terms of this chapter may apply to the Attorney General for assistance. The Attorney General may act on such tenant’s behalf to secure restraining actions to abate the disturbance and/or to prohibit the owner from engaging in any course of conduct (including, but not limited to, interruption or discontinuance of essential services) which would substantially interfere with such person’s tenancy.(d) Where the lease of a tenant expires after the conversion plan has been filed, and such tenant continues to rent a site within the manufactured home community, the owner shall not increase the rent on an annual basis more than the average or the prior year’s annual increase in rent of the 3 geographically nearest manufactured home communities in the county in which the community is located. The average increase in rent will be determined as of the date on which the lease expires. There shall be no more than 1 rent increase imposed upon the tenant during any 1 calendar year.64 Del. Laws, c. 14,\n\n§\n\n 2;74 Del. Laws, c. 35,\n\n§\n\n 8;84 Del. Laws, c. 42,\n\n§\n\n125;§\n\n7111.

Any increase in rent shall be in conformity with the terms of § 7110(d) of this title.64 Del. Laws, c. 14,\n\n§\n\n 2;74 Del. Laws, c. 35,\n\n§\n\n 8;78 Del. Laws, c. 179,\n\n§§\n\n 273, 274;§\n\n7112. Eviction; access to comparable housing.(a) Where, at the conclusion of the grace period, a tenant is evicted by order of court solely as a result of the conversion, the owner shall pay for all expenses incurred by such tenant in moving into the tenant’s new residence. If the new residence is in a manufactured home community, such expenses shall include all “setting up” expenses, including connections to all utilities.(b) Within 18 full months after receiving final notice any tenant may request that the owner provide a list of available comparable housing or comparable manufactured home sites and a reasonable opportunity to examine and rent such comparable housing or manufactured home site.(c) After the expiration of the 3-year period, the owner may institute an action in the Superior Court for the eviction of any tenant or tenants who still have manufactured homes within the community or who otherwise have continued to reside within the community; or a tenant, group of tenants or tenant association may apply to the Superior Court for a stay of any eviction proceedings. The Court may, in its discretion, authorize 1-year stays of eviction subject to such rent increases as authorized by § 7110(d) of this title until such time as the Court is satisfied that the tenant has been provided a list of comparable housing or comparable manufactured home sites and is satisfied that the tenant has been provided a reasonable opportunity to examine and rent such housing or manufactured home site. Except where the owner has failed to provide such a list of comparable housing or manufactured home sites, or has failed to provide a reasonable opportunity to examine and rent such housing or manufactured home site, the Court shall grant not more than 5 such eviction stays.64 Del. Laws, c. 14,\n\n§\n\n 2;74 Del. Laws, c. 35,\n\n§\n\n 8;84 Del. Laws, c. 42,\n\n§\n\n126;§\n\n7113. Penalties; jurisdiction.(a)Civil penalties. —(1) Where an owner violates a provision of § 7105 of this title any action taken by the owner to convert the real property on which a manufactured home community is located into multiple-unit usage shall be invalid; provided, however, that the owner, by again giving the preliminary notice required under § 7105 of this title, may again begin the conversion process.(2) Where the owner fails to give the tenants’ association its option to purchase under § 7108 of this title, no subsequent sale or purchase of the real property or of any unit within the conversion project shall be valid. Where the owner fails to provide a tenant with an opportunity to purchase under § 7108 of this title, the tenant shall nevertheless be offered a unit in preference to any nontenant who has agreed to purchase a unit during or subsequent to the time of the tenant’s right to purchase.(3) Any binding agreement entered into by an owner which results in a violation of any provision of this chapter is:a. Void, if a person residing in the manufactured home community at the time of the preliminary notice was an object of, or was adversely affected by, such violation; orb. Voidable at the option of any party thereto.(b)Criminal penalties; jurisdiction. —(1) Any person who is convicted of a violation of a provision of this chapter shall be fined a sum not less than $100 nor more than $500 for each offense.

Laws, c. 14,\n\n§\n\n 2;74 Del. Laws, c. 35,\n\n§\n\n 8;§\n\n7114. Modification or waiver of chapter.(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any provision in a lease or other agreement which waives or modifies any provision of this chapter shall be void and unenforceable as against public policy. An owner and tenant may, however, agree to a modification or waiver of some or all of the protections afforded to the tenant pursuant to this chapter; provided, however:(1) The modification or waiver is encompassed in a written contract which is separate from the lease;(2) The modification or waiver is voluntarily entered into without duress;(3) The modification or waiver is entered into with full understanding of this chapter, the terms of any contract to which the modification or waiver applies, and the modification or waiver itself;(4) The modification or waiver is for adequate consideration.(b) In any action involving a modification or waiver, the owner shall have the burden of proof to establish that the requirements of this chapter and of this section have been met.64 Del.
