However, it is the policy of the State to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by encouraging the development and use of renewable resources and to remove obstacles thereto. Accordingly, reasonable restrictions on roof mounted systems for obtaining solar energy are those restrictions that do not significantly increase the cost of the system or significantly decrease its efficiency or specified performance, or that allow for an alternative system of comparable cost, efficiency, and energy conservation benefits.(d) This section shall not amend, nullify, or affect the enforceability of any conservation easement or historic preservation covenant.(e) (1) a.

If the covenants, restrictions, or conditions governing the owner’s property do not impose a reasonable restriction on a roof mounted system for obtaining solar energy, the input or direction provided by the maintenance corporation, homeowner’s association, or neighboring property owner on the placement of the system must be reasonable. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)a.2., “reasonable” means input or direction that does not significantly increase the cost of the roof mounted system for obtaining solar energy or significantly decrease the system’s efficiency or specified performance.b. The maintenance corporation, homeowner’s association, or neighboring property owner shall provide the input or direction required under this paragraph (f)(2) to the owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the mailing address provide under paragraph (f)(1)b. of this section.c.

Any fee, charge, assessment, fine, or other amount payable to the unit owners association of a common interest community or of a condominium for the benefit of the unit owners pursuant to a declaration, covenant, or law applicable to such association, including, but not limited to, permissible charges payable for resale certificates issued by the association or its authorized agent, or a start-up fee or capital contribution to the reserve fund providing such fund is not for the payment of financing arranged by the developer or builder.(2) “Transfer” means the sale, gift, conveyance, assignment, devise by will, inheritance through intestate laws, or other transfer or release of an estate or interest in real property located in this State.(3) “Transfer fee covenant” means a declaration or covenant purporting to affect real property which requires or purports to require the payment of a private transfer fee to the declarant or other person or entity specified in the covenant or declaration, or to their successors or assigns, upon a subsequent transfer of an estate or interest in the real property.(b)Transfer fee covenant prohibition. —A transfer fee covenant recorded in this State on or after July 27, 2010, or unrecorded shall not run with the title to real property and is not binding on or enforceable at law or in equity against any owner (legal or equitable), subsequent owner (legal or equitable), purchaser, or mortgagee of any estate or interest in real property as an equitable servitude, contract, or otherwise. Any lien purporting to secure the payment of a private transfer fee under a transfer fee covenant recorded in this State on or after July 27, 2010, is void and unenforceable. This section does not mean that a transfer fee covenant or lien arising from a transfer fee covenant recorded in this State before July 27, 2010, or unrecorded is presumed valid and enforceable.(c) The Attorney General may charge the use of a transfer fee covenant in violation of this section as a violation of consumer law under § 2513 of Title 6 or this section may be enforced by private action.77 Del. Laws, c. 448,\n\n§\n\n 1;",
