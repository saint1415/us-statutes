C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2107;§\n\n2108.

Two or more mortgages, recorded at the same time, do not have preference or priority as between themselves.Code 1852,\n\n§\n\n 1634; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3224;28 Del.

Effect of release of part of mortgaged premises; acknowledgment and recording.The release by the mortgagee or that mortgagee’s assigns, executed at the instance of the mortgagor, that mortgagor’s heirs or assigns, of any part of the mortgaged premises shall not be deemed or taken to operate as a release or discharge of any other part of the lands included in such mortgage, but such other lands shall be and remain subject to the lien of the mortgage, and execution may be had thereof in the same manner as if the mortgage had originally included only such lands. Every such release shall be under hand and seal, and shall be acknowledged in the same manner as provided by law for the acknowledgment of deeds, and shall become effective upon the date of filing in the office of the recorder of deeds in and for the county in which such lands so released are situated.11 Del.

Procedure to compel entry of satisfaction of mortgage or judgment.(a) In all cases where mortgages or judgments are liens on real estate in this State and the same have been paid and the mortgagee or obligee or their executors, administrators or assigns refuses or neglects to enter satisfaction of such mortgage or judgment on the record thereof in the office where the same is recorded or entered, forthwith after the payment thereof, the mortgagor or obligor or their heirs or assigns may, upon sworn petition to the Superior Court of the county in which such mortgage or judgment is recorded or entered, setting forth the facts, obtain from such Court a rule on the mortgagee or obligee or their executors, administrators or assigns, returnable at such time as the Court may direct, requiring such mortgagee or obligee or their executors, administrators or assigns to appear on the day fixed by the Court and show cause, if they have any, why such mortgage or judgment shall not be marked satisfied on the record thereof. Such rule shall be served as provided by law for service of writs of scire facias. In case the mortgagee or obligee or their executors, administrators or assigns reside out of the State and cannot be served, or in case the mortgagee or obligee is a corporation which has been dissolved for more than 3 years prior to the filing of the petition, and for whom no trustee or receiver has been appointed, the rule shall be continued and a copy thereof shall be published by the sheriff in a newspaper of the county once each week for 4 successive weeks, and upon proof of such advertisement by affidavit of the sheriff made at the time to which such rule was continued, shall be deemed and considered sufficient service of such rule.(b) Upon the return of the rule, if the Court is satisfied from the evidence produced that such mortgage or judgment, together with all interest and costs due thereon, has been satisfied and paid, the rule shall be made absolute, and the Court shall order and decree that the mortgage or judgment is paid and satisfied, and shall order and direct the recorder or the prothonotary, in whose office such mortgage or judgment is entered, to enter on the record thereof full and complete satisfaction thereof.22 Del.

Priority of mortgages and other instruments securing future advances and certain other advances; modifications of mortgages and other instruments.(a) Any mortgage or other instrument given for the purpose of creating a lien on real property, when so expressed therein or when so expressed in a separate instrument or other agreement specifically referred to therein and incorporated by reference (which instrument or other agreement need not be recorded), may secure not only existing indebtedness, but also future advances, whether such advances are obligatory or to be made at the option of the lender, or otherwise, and whether made before or after default or maturity or other similar events, to the same extent as if such future advances were made on the date of the execution of such mortgage or other such instrument, although there may be no advance made at the time of the execution of such mortgage or other instrument and although there may be no indebtedness outstanding at the time any advance is made. Such lien, as to third persons with or without actual knowledge thereof, shall be valid as to all such indebtedness and future advances from the time the mortgage or other such instrument is recorded or filed in the proper office as provided by law. The total amount of the indebtedness having the priority established by such lien may decrease or increase from time to time, but the total unpaid principal balance at any 1 time shall not exceed the maximum principal amount of the obligation which must be specified in such mortgage or other such recorded instrument.Any mortgage or other instrument to which this subsection applies, and all such existing indebtedness, future advances and interest thereon, shall have preference to and priority over any lien, other than those liens the priority of which is governed by § 2901 of this title, which is subsequent in time to the time such mortgage or other such instrument is recorded or filed in the proper office as provided by law.(b) In addition to the stated indebtedness, a mortgage or other instrument given for the purpose of creating a lien on real property may secure disbursements and other advances thereunder for the payment of taxes, assessments, maintenance charges, insurance premiums or costs relating to the property encumbered by such mortgage or other instrument, for the discharge of liens having priority over the lien of such mortgage or other instrument, for the curing of waste of the property that is the subject of the lien, for the indemnification obligations regarding environmental liabilities of the property that is the subject of the lien, and for the payment of service charges and expenses incurred by reason of default, and including late charges, attorneys’ fees and court costs, if such mortgage or other such instrument states that it shall secure any such advances and disbursements, together with all interest thereon.Any mortgage or other instrument to which this subsection applies, and all such stated indebtedness, disbursements and other advances expressed therein and interest thereon, shall have preference to and priority over any lien, other than those liens the priority of which is governed by § 2901 of this title, which is subsequent in time to the time such mortgage or other such instrument is recorded or filed in the proper office as provided by law.(c) Nothing in this section is intended to limit or restrict the obligations, indebtedness, liabilities, covenants, disbursements or advances that may be secured by any mortgage or other instrument given for the purpose of creating a lien on real property.(d) The preference and priority of the lien of any mortgage or other such instrument given for the purpose of creating a lien on real property and all matters secured thereby shall extend to any and all future modifications thereof, or of the obligations secured by the mortgage or such other instrument, that have been recorded or filed in the proper office as provided by law, except for such modification as expressly increases the maximum principal amount that is specified in such mortgage or other such instrument or separate instrument or agreement referred to in subsection (a) of this section.(e) Nothing herein shall be construed to limit any agreement between the lender and the borrower or other parties to any such mortgage or other such instrument given for the purpose of creating a lien on real property as to the time period for the repayment of such existing indebtedness, future advances, interest, service charges and disbursements as aforesaid, as to other obligations, advances or disbursements that are secured thereby or as to any other terms and conditions of such mortgages or other such instrument.59 Del.

Insurance requirements for mortgages.(a) The mortgagee or obligee of any mortgage or other instrument given for the purpose of creating a lien on real property shall accept as evidence of insurance a written binder issued by any authorized insurer or its agent if the binder includes or is accompanied by:(1) The name and address of the insured borrower;(2) The name and address of the lender as loss payee;(3) A description of the insured real property;(4) A provision that the binder may not be cancelled within the term of the binder unless the lender and the insured borrower receive written notice of the cancellation at least 10 days prior to the cancellation;(5) Except in the case of a renewal of a policy subsequent to the closing of the loan, a paid receipt for the full amount of the applicable premium; and(6) The amount of insurance coverage.A mortgagee or obligee may refuse to honor a binder in cases where the lender receives notice of the cancellation of the binder by the insurer; or, at the expiration of 30 days of the date the binder was given, the insurer has failed to issue the policy of insurance.(b) The mortgagee or obligee of any mortgage or other instrument given for the purpose of creating a lien on real property shall not require hazard insurance in an amount which exceeds the greater of:(1) The value placed on the improvements by the insurer; or(2) The value placed on the improvements as determined by the lender’s appraisal of the real property.(c) In the event that subsection (a) or (b) of this section is wilfully violated, the original mortgagee or obligee listed upon the original mortgage or other instrument shall be obligated to pay to the mortgagor or obligor:(1) Reasonable attorneys’ fees; and(2) The greater of the actual damages directly resulting from the violation or 5% of the face amount of the mortgage.(d) A violation of this section shall not affect the validity of the mortgage or other instrument which creates the lien securing the loan.(e) For purposes of this section, a “mortgage or other instrument given for the purpose of creating a lien on real property” shall mean a consumer purpose mortgage or other consumer purpose instrument given for the purpose of creating a lien. For purposes of this section, “consumer purpose mortgage” and “consumer purpose instrument given for the purpose of creating a lien” shall mean mortgages or other instruments given for the purpose of creating a lien encumbering 1-to-4 family residential properties, and shall not include mortgages or other instruments given for the purpose of creating a lien encumbering other multi-unit residential properties, such as apartment buildings, or encumbering office, commercial or industrial properties.68 Del.

Instruments transferring, pledging or assigning lessors’ interests in leases or rents arising from real property as security.(a) Upon recording, in the office of the recorder of deeds in and for the county where the real property lies, of any instrument transferring, pledging or assigning the lessor’s interest in leases (whether in existence or thereafter existing) of or rents (including security deposits) arising from real property as conditional or unconditional security for a debt or duty, the interest of the transferee, pledgee or assignee shall be fully perfected as to the transferor, pledgor or assignor and as to all third parties without the necessity of furnishing further notice to the transferor, pledgor or assignor or any lessee, of obtaining possession of the real property, of impounding the rents or security deposits, of filing a financing statement under the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code, of securing the appointment of a receiver, or of taking any other affirmative action, and such interest shall have priority according to the time of recording the instrument in the proper office, without respect to the time of its being signed and delivered.(b) Except as may be provided in the lease or other agreement by which it is bound, the lessee under any such lease identified in subsection (a) of this section is authorized to pay the transferor, pledgor or assignor, rents and security deposits until the lessee receives written notification that rents due or to become due have been transferred, pledged or assigned and that payment is to be made to the transferee, pledgee or assignee. A notification that does not reasonably identify the rents transferred, pledged or assigned is ineffective. If requested by the lessee, the transferee, pledgee or assignee must furnish reasonable proof that the assignment has been made and is in full force and effect and unless so furnished the lessee may pay the transferor, pledgor or assignor.(c) Whenever the debt or duty secured by an instrument described in this section is satisfied or performed, and to the extent such instrument is not self-terminating, upon such an event, the transferee, pledgee or assignee shall forthwith cause to be recorded in the office in which the instrument is recorded a document pursuant to which it declares that the instrument is terminated. The recording of such document shall extinguish the instrument and the effect shall be the same as if such instrument had not been made.(d) Any recorded instrument transferring, pledging or assigning an interest in leases of or rents arising from real property shall be duly perfected as herein provided, except that nothing herein shall alter, change or modify any perfected order of priority of interests in such leases or rents which exists on the date that this legislation is enacted.70 Del. Laws, c. 253,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2122. Procedure to strike an entry of satisfaction or other indication of a mortgage satisfaction.(a) When entry of satisfaction, recordation of a mortgage satisfaction piece or other indication of a mortgage satisfaction has been made upon the record through inadvertence, error or mistake, any person or party affected by such inadvertence, error or mistake may, upon sworn petition to the Superior Court of the county in which such mortgage was recorded, setting forth the facts, obtain from such Court a rule on the mortgagor or obligor or their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, returnable at such time as the Court may direct, requiring such mortgagor or obligor or their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns to appear on the day fixed by the Court and show cause, if they have any, why the entry of satisfaction or other indication of a mortgage satisfaction should not be stricken. Such rule shall be served as provided by law for service of writs of scire facias. In case the mortgagor or obligor or their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns reside out of the State and cannot be served, or in case the mortgagor or obligor is a corporation which has been dissolved for more than 3 years prior to the filing of the petition, and for whom no trustee or receiver has been appointed, the rule shall be continued and a copy thereof shall be published by the sheriff in a newspaper of the county once each week for 4 successive weeks, and upon proof of such advertisement by affidavit of the sheriff made at the time to which such rule was continued, shall be deemed and considered sufficient service of such rule.(b) Upon the return of the rule, if the Court is satisfied from the evidence produced that entry of satisfaction or other indication of a mortgage satisfaction had been made upon the record of such mortgage through inadvertence, error or mistake, the rule shall be made absolute, and the Court shall order and decree that the entry of satisfaction or other indication of a mortgage satisfaction of such mortgage shall be stricken as if such satisfaction or other indication of a mortgage satisfaction had not been made.(c) Upon the issuance of an order striking an entry of satisfaction or other indication of a mortgage satisfaction, the party who obtains such order shall forthwith file with the recorder of deeds a certified copy of said order. The recorder shall at once record said order and make a proper note of the same in the indices. The recorder shall collect recording fees upon receipt of the instrument as provided for in § 9607 of Title 9.72 Del. Laws, c. 141,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2123. Satisfaction of mortgage after lapse of time.(a) Any mortgage or deed of trust having the effect of a mortgage (hereinafter “mortgage”) that is unsatisfied upon the public records and remains a lien on any real estate may be satisfied pursuant to the procedures set forth in subsection (b) of this section:(1) After the lapse of 10 years from the date for the maturity of such lien set forth in such mortgage, or in any modification, extension or continuance thereof duly recorded in like manner and place; or(2) In the absence of any fixed or ascertainable maturity date stated in such mortgage or any such modification, extension or continuance thereof, after the lapse of 40 years from the latest of the date of recording the mortgage or of any modification, extension, or continuance thereof (as the case may be).(b) An attorney authorized to practice law in the State of Delaware shall be authorized to satisfy a mortgage that remains a lien pursuant to subsection (a) of this section above, provided the following procedures are followed:(1) Written notice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, must be sent to the last mortgagee of record as defined below requesting that the mortgage be immediately satisfied or that the last mortgagee of record notify the attorney, by certified mail, return receipt requested, within 60 days of the mailing of said notice, that the obligation secured by the mortgage has not been satisfied or performed pursuant to § 2111(a) of this title. The last mortgagee of record shall mean the legal holder of the mortgage and at the address which appears upon the recorded mortgage, or any assignment, modification, extension or continuance thereof, or counsel of record for the legal holder of the mortgage duly recorded in like manner or place, or if such addresses are not ascertainable from the public records, at the last known available or reasonably ascertainable address of the last mortgagee of record or if none, addressed care of the Office of the Delaware Bank Commissioner.(2) If the mortgage remains unsatisfied for an additional period of 60 days after the above notice has been mailed, and during such time the attorney has not received any notification from the last mortgagee of record that the obligation secured by the mortgage has not been satisfied or performed pursuant to § 2111(a) of this title, the attorney may file an affidavit of satisfaction in the form set forth in subsection (c) of this section below.(c) An affidavit of satisfaction permitted under this section shall contain the following information:(1) The mortgage record, volume and page, instrument number or other recording data of the mortgage proposed to be marked fully paid and satisfied;(2) The name of the original mortgagee, as the same appears in the mortgage;(3) The name of the original mortgagor or mortgagors, as the same appears in the mortgage;(4) The original date of the mortgage (if specified therein);(5) The original principal amount of the mortgage (if specified therein);(6) The name of each assignee to whom the mortgage was subsequently assigned of record, together with the dates and recording information of said assignments;(7) The full name and address of the last mortgagee of record;(8) A statement by the attorney that:a. Such attorney has sent the notice required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section;b. Such attorney has not received from the last mortgagee of record notice that the obligation secured by the mortgage has not been satisfied or performed pursuant to § 2111(a) of this title;c. After passage of the period of time specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the mortgage has not been satisfied; andd. The attorney has reason to believe that the mortgage is a consumer purpose mortgage or consumer purpose deed of trust;(9) That the attorney requests the recorder of deeds in the county in which the mortgage is recorded to indicate in the property records of that county that such mortgage is fully paid and satisfied;(10) That the attorney whose signature appears on said affidavit has personally reviewed all of the information and each of the facts contained in said affidavit and request; and(11) That the information contained in said affidavit and request is true and correct to the best of the attorney’s knowledge.(d) The recorder of deeds, or a duly appointed deputy, in the county in which the mortgage is recorded shall be authorized to cause said mortgage to be satisfied upon the receipt of such affidavit and request by the attorney.(e) The recorder of deeds office may charge a fee for accepting and recording the affidavit and satisfying the mortgage.(f) An affidavit filed pursuant to this section does not in itself extinguish any obligation secured by the mortgage that is the subject of the affidavit. An attorney who files an affidavit pursuant to subsection (c) of this section is not liable to any person if the attorney complied with this section and the last mortgagee of record did not respond in a timely manner to the notification pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.(g) This section shall in no way limit the authority of the recorder of deeds to otherwise satisfy mortgages as provided by law.(h) This section does not supplant any other remedy or process available for the satisfaction or release of mortgages.(i) A mortgagor, grantor, or interested party is entitled to the presumption that a mortgage that is unsatisfied on the public records and remains a lien on real estate has been paid and satisfied if any of the following has occurred:(1) A lapse of 10 years from the date for the maturity of the lien set forth in the mortgage or a modification, extension, or continuance of the mortgage that is duly recorded in like manner and place.(2) In the absence of any fixed or ascertainable maturity date stated in the mortgage or a modification, extension, or continuance of the mortgage, a lapse of 40 years from the latest of the date of recording of the mortgage or of a modification, extension, or continuance of the mortgage.(j) If an action has not been brought to enforce the lien of a mortgage within the time provided under subsection (i) of this section then, notwithstanding any other right or remedy available either at law or equity, the lien created by the mortgage terminates, is no longer enforceable against the property, and is extinguished as a lien against the property.(k) The termination and extinguishment, under subsection (j) of this section, of the lien created by the mortgage does not extinguish an obligation secured by the mortgage.(l) This section applies to all mortgages recorded before, on, or after October 14, 2022.(m) Subsection (a) of this section does not limit subsections (i) and (j) of this section.75 Del. Laws, c. 307,\n\n§\n\n 6;83 Del. Laws, c. 466,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n2124. Recordation of mortgagee’s change of address.(a) Any mortgagee or any assignee of a mortgage under § 2109 of this title that changes its notice address from the address stated in any mortgage or assignment of mortgage must, within 60 days of a change in its notice address, file in the recorder of deeds office in the county in which the mortgage or any assignment has been recorded a statement of mortgagee address change.(1) The filing of a statement of mortgagee address change is public notice to all parties interested in such mortgage or assignment of mortgage, or the property upon which it is a lien, of the address where the legal holder of such mortgage or assignment of mortgage must receive any notice.(2) Until such time as a statement of mortgagee address change has been filed, any party having an interest in such mortgage or assignment of mortgage, or the property upon which it is a lien, is fully protected by sending all notices to the legal holder of such mortgage or assignment of mortgage at the notice address provided in the mortgage or the last assignment of record.(3) A mortgagee is not required to file a separate statement of mortgagee address change for each mortgage recorded in the county or to include each mortgage recorded in the county on a statement of mortgagee address change.(4) It is unlawful for a mortgagee to fail to file a statement of mortgagee address change as required under this section. A violation of this paragraph (a)(4) is punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 and costs of not more than $1,000.(5) The Superior Court has jurisdiction over a violation of paragraph (a)(4) of this section.(b) Each recorder of deeds may promulgate a sample form to be used to file a statement of mortgagee address change.(c) Each recorder of deeds shall create and maintain a separate index for statements of mortgagee address change. The index must be called the “statement of mortgagee address change index” and must reference the mortgagee who has changed its address and include the mortgagee’s notice address as provided in the statement of mortgagee address change. The index does not need to include reference to each mortgage recorded in the county by the mortgagee who filed a statement of mortgagee address change.(d) Each recorder of deeds may charge a fee for accepting and recording a statement of mortgagee address change. The fee must reasonably reflect the costs necessary to defray expenses associated with creating and maintaining the statement of mortgagee address change index.81 Del. Laws, c. 151,\n\n§\n\n1;81 Del.
