Where a building or structure is improved under emergency conditions, a municipality or political subdivision may subsequently secure a personal judgment or obtain a lien against the property without first having complied with the foregoing notice provisions.(b) In the event any municipality or other political subdivision of this State, in the exercise of its slum clearance and redevelopment authority or its urban renewal authority or its authority in carrying out any duly adopted building code, shall have expended public funds for the purpose of exterior improvements to any abandoned or vacant building deemed to be unsafe or to any other vacant building or structure within its jurisdiction, after such notice as is provided for in subsection (a) of this section, the sums so expended, with legal interest thereon from the date of expenditure, shall be reimbursed to such municipality or political subdivision, on demand, by the person or persons who were the owner or owners of such building or structure at the time such work of exterior improvement commenced; and if not so reimbursed, said sums, with interest accrued thereon, may be collected from such owner or owners in an action at law commenced by such municipality or political subdivision within 6 years after the date of the final expenditure of funds for such exterior improvement costs.(c) Where a municipality or other political subdivision of this State shall expend public funds for the purpose of exterior improvements to any vacant or abandoned building deemed to be unsafe or any other vacant building or structure within its jurisdiction, after such notice as is provided for in subsection (a) of this section, such municipality or political subdivision may enter a lien for the amount so expended, with interest accrued thereon, on the lands and premises on which such work of exterior improvement was performed, in the office of the prothonotary for the county in which such lands and premises are situate in the docket provided for in subsection (d) of this section and such liens shall continue until paid and discharged.(d) The prothonotary of each county shall prepare a docket to be known as the “Lien Docket for Public Expenditures for Exterior Improvements” in which shall be recorded all liens provided for by subsection (b) of this section. Such liens shall be certified in writing to the prothonotary by the municipality or other governmental subdivision of this State entitled to the same, which certification shall list the owner of the lands and premises as such owner appears on the tax assessment records of such municipality or other political subdivision on the date of lien certification, the principal amount of the lien and the applicable interest rate, and shall identify the lands and premises by brief description and by the parcel number thereof as said parcel number appears on the real estate tax records of such municipality or other governmental subdivision. Such information and the date of filing shall be entered by the prothonotary in the lien docket, which docket shall contain in the back thereof an index according to the name of the owner of the property against which such lien is entered. When any such lien is satisfied by payment, the prothonotary, acting under the supervision of the municipality or other political subdivision holding such lien, shall enter thereon the date of final payment and the words “satisfied in full.” The prothonotary shall receive a fee of $1.00 for each satisfaction.67 Del.
