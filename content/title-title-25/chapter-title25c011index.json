Perpetuating testimony of boundaries.(a) Any person interested in perpetuating testimony respecting boundaries or landmarks may file a petition in the Court of Chancery representing the case, and naming the tenants and the owners of adjoining land, and praying for an order to take depositions to perpetuate testimony respecting the bounds. A summons shall be issued for summoning the tenants and owners to appear and show cause if they have any objection to such order. If any of them cannot be found, the Court may order proper service or publication of notice to them. If no sufficient objection is shown, the Court shall order that commission issue to 1 or more persons to take depositions on interrogatories filed after 10 days written notice of the filing thereof. Notice to an attorney or solicitor of record shall be sufficient notice to the party for whom the attorney or solicitor of record appears, and notice need not be given to any person not residing in the county where the lands lie.(b) Each party may produce witnesses to be examined under the commission. The Court may suppress the depositions and make new orders, or it may order the depositions to be recorded, and they shall then be evidence against the parties to the petition and their privies in any suit or controversy in which the bounds which they concern shall come in question, in case of the death of the witnesses or inability to procure their attendance.(c) If any person is not summoned or notified, the order for commission may be made without notice to that person; but that person shall not be affected by the proceedings.(d) Each party shall bear the costs of the attendance and examination of witnesses produced by each such party; all the other costs shall be paid by the petitioner.(e) The commissioners may employ a clerk.

They may cause the land mentioned in the commission, or any other land, to be surveyed, and may appoint 1 or more surveyors and chain carriers to make the survey, and may swear them to do their duty faithfully and impartially, according to the best of their skill and ability. They may also swear the witnesses. They may adjourn from time to time. The commissioners, or a majority of them concurring, shall cause the land mentioned in the commission to be marked and bounded according to its true original location, and shall return a certificate of the marked bounds or lines to the Court, under their hands, which return shall be recorded in the recorder’s office of the county, unless it is set aside by the Court for irregularity.Code 1852,\n\n§\n\n 995; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3619; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 4168; \n\n25 Del.

The term of 7 years shall not begin to run against any person while that person is in possession of the land in controversy.Code 1852,\n\n§\n\n 996; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3620; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 4169; \n\n25 Del.

Boundaries fixed by agreement of parties.If any lines or boundaries are ascertained and fixed by agreement of parties, they shall not be disturbed by any commission, as between the same parties or those claiming under either of them.

Right of holders of separate parts of tract or of younger survey to a commission.When several persons hold separate parts of the same tract, they, or any of them, may have a commission to mark and bound the whole, as well as the several parts thereof. When any person holding a younger survey is interested in the locating of interfering or neighboring elder surveys, the person shall have a commission to mark and bound the elder survey. Three months’ written notice shall be given to the person seised of the elder tract of the intention to apply for such commission. The commission may be obtained only if the person seised of the elder tract neglects to apply for and obtain the commission. The commission shall be executed in like manner and have the same effect as if obtained by a person seised of the land therein mentioned.Code 1852,\n\n§\n\n 998; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3622; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 4171; \n\n25 Del.
