      "text": "Any person may erect or raise a dam to raise water for working any mill upon and across any stream in this State, where it is not navigable, upon the terms and conditions and subject to the regulations hereinafter expressed. No such dam shall be erected to the injury\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3669; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 4221; \n\n23 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1901;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1902. Procedure to condemn materials for building and repair of dams.Whenever earth, sand, gravel, stone or other material requisite for the construction or repair of any lawful dam shall lie contiguous or adjacent to such dam, the owner of such dam may proceed by petition, setting forth the facts, to the Superior Court of any county in term time, or to any Judge thereof in vacation, upon 10 days’ notice to the owner of such earth, sand, gravel, stone or other material, if resident within the State, or, if nonresident, to the tenant residing upon the premises. The Court or any Judge thereof shall thereupon by order appoint 5 disinterested freeholders of the county as commissioners, directing them to go upon the premises described in the petition and assess the value of such earth, sand, gravel, stone or other material stated in the petition to be required, and also to determine the damages sustained by the owner thereof by reason of taking the same, and make return thereof under their hands or the hands of a majority of them, which return shall be forthwith filed in the office of the Clerk of the Court in the county wherein the proceedings shall take place. Upon amount of damages so being paid unto the person entitled, or deposited to their credit in any state or national bank having an office or a branch in the county where the proceedings shall have been commenced, the owner of such dam may enter in and upon the premises described in the petition, containing such earth, stone, sand, gravel or other material, and take and remove and use the same for the construction or repair of their dam. If either party be dissatisfied with the amount of damages awarded, upon notice and petition filed within 30 days after the return of the commissioners, the Court or any Judge thereof shall grant an order of review and appoint 5 other freeholders, who shall review the premises and reassess the damages and make return.If greater damages are allowed than were given on the first order, such increase shall be forthwith paid or deposited by the owner of the dam, and if less damages shall be allowed, the difference between the sums so awarded shall be refunded, the costs of such review to be borne by the unsuccessful party. Proceedings for a review shall not delay the right of the owner of the dam to take and use the materials in question in the repair or construction of such dam after having paid or deposited the amount first awarded.13 Del. Laws, c. 450,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3670; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 4222; \n\n23 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1902;63 Del. Laws, c. 142,\n\n§\n\n 40;§\n\n1903. Right of entry to repair banks of stream.If at any time a breach in the banks of any stream, upon which a lawful dam shall exist, shall occur by reason of flood or from any other cause whereby the usual volume of water shall be diverted from its customary channel to the injury of the owner of such dam and water power, such owner may enter in and upon the lands where such breach shall have occurred and repair the dam. All damages which may occur unto the premises by reason of such entry and repair shall be assessed upon the application of either party in interest in the mode appointed in § 1902 of this title and subject to the same provisions as to payment or deposit and review.13 Del. Laws, c. 450,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3671; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 4223; \n\n23 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1903;§\n\n1904. Forcing water back to injury of adjoining landowners; penalty; exceptions.Whoever owns, leases or controls any milldam or millpond upon or across any stream of water shall construct and maintain the dam across such stream in such manner and with such gates and appliances that the waters of the stream shall not at any time be thrown, held or forced back upon the land of any other owner above such millpond to the injury or damage of such other owner.Whoever violates this section, upon the complaint of the owner of land injured or damaged thereby, shall be fined not more than $10 for each day such violation continues. Whoever offends shall also be liable in pecuniary damages to the owner of land injured by any violation of this section, to be recovered in an action at law. This section shall not apply to the flooding of lands by backwater occasioned by rains or freshets. This section shall apply within the limits of Kent and Sussex Counties only.26 Del.
