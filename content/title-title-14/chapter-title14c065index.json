No part of the revenues or funds of the University from other sources shall in any manner be expended for the purpose of paying such principal and interest.(c) The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates per annum, payable semiannually, shall mature at such time or times and may be made redeemable before maturity at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board of Trustees prior to the issuance of the bonds. The principal and interest of such bonds may be made payable in any lawful medium. The Board of Trustees shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State.(d) The bonds shall be signed by the President of the Board of Trustees, or shall bear the facsimile signature of the President of the Board of Trustees, in which latter event such bonds shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an officer of a bank or trust company appointed by resolution of the Board of Trustees as fiscal agent in connection with the bond issue, and the seal of the University, or facsimile thereof, shall be affixed to the bonds and shall be attested by the Secretary of the Board of Trustees, which attestation may, if the bonds are authenticated as above provided, be by facsimile signature of the Secretary of the Board of Trustees; and any coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the President of the Board of Trustees. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile thereof shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if the officer had remained in office until such delivery.(e) All revenue bonds issued under this chapter shall have, and are declared to have, as between successive holders, all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the law of this State.(f) Such bonds and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation by the State or by any political subdivision, agency or authority thereof.(g) The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form or both as the Board of Trustees may determine and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion of any bonds registered both as to principal and interest into coupon bonds.(h) The Board of Trustees may sell such bonds either at public or private sale in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the University.(i) The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the specified capital improvements and shall be disbursed in the same manner as other University funds. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be held for application to the payment of principal and interest of such bonds.(j) Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Board of Trustees may, under like restrictions, issue temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issue of the latter. The Board of Trustees may also provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost.(k) Any contracts or classes of contracts with firms or individuals entered into by Delaware State University in connection with the issuance and sale of any revenue bonds authorized by this section must be approved by the majority of the State’s bond issuing officers (as defined for the purposes of Title 29, Chapter 74), or authorized designees.(l) Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified and required by this chapter.68 Del. Laws, c. 97,\n\n§\n\n 1;69 Del. Laws, c. 67,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n6513.

Laws, c. 97,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n6514. Credit of State not pledged.Revenue bonds issued under this chapter shall be payable exclusively from specified funds of the University. All such bonds shall contain a statement on their face that the State is not obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon and that the faith and credit of the State are not pledged to the payment of the principal or interest of such bonds. The issuance of revenue bonds under this chapter shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the State to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment.68 Del.
