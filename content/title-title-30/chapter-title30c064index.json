The average of the value, at the beginning and end of the income year, of all the real and tangible personal property, owned or rented, in this State by the taxpayer, expressed as a percentage of the average of the value at the beginning and end of the income year of all such property of the taxpayer both within and without this State; provided, that any property, the income from which is separately allocated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section or which is not used in the taxpayer’s business, shall be disregarded.
