Special state deposits held for the exclusive benefit of policyholders, or policyholders and creditors, of any particular state not exceeding net liabilities reports for that state;5. Secured accrued retrospective premiums;6. If a life insurer:A. The amount of its policy loans to policyholders within the United States, not exceeding the amount of legal reserve required on each such policy; andB. The net amount of uncollected and deferred premiums; and7. Any other nontrusteed asset which the Commissioner determines secures liabilities in a substantially similar manner; and(3) Any additional information that the Commissioner may require relating to the total business or assets, or any portion thereof, of the non-U.S. insurer.(b) The annual statement and trusteed surplus statement shall be signed and verified by the United States manager, attorney-in-fact, or a duly empowered assistant United States manager, of the U.S. branch. The items of securities and other property held under trust deeds shall be certified in the trusteed surplus statement by the United States trustee or trustees.(c) Every report on examination of a U.S. branch shall include a trusteed surplus statement as of the date of examination in addition to the general statement of the financial condition of the U.S. branch.80 Del.

No U.S. branch shall be authorized to do an insurance business in this State if it does anywhere within the United States any kind of business other than an insurance business and the business necessarily or properly incidental to the kinds of insurance business which it is authorized to do in this State.(d) Except as otherwise specifically provided, no U.S. branch, entering through this State or another state, shall be or continue to be authorized to do an insurance business in this State if it fails to comply substantially with any requirement or limitation of this chapter, applicable to similar domestic insurers hereafter organized, which in the judgment of the Commissioner is reasonably necessary to protect the interest of the policyholders.(e) No U.S. branch which does anywhere within the United States any kind or combination of kinds of insurance business not permitted to be done in this State by similar domestic insurers hereafter organized, shall be or continue to be authorized to do an insurance business in this State, unless in the judgment of the Commissioner the doing of such kind or combination of kinds of insurance business will not be prejudicial to the best interests of the people of this State.(f) No U.S. branch shall be or continue to be authorized to do an insurance business in this State if it fails to keep full and correct entries of its transactions, which shall at all times be open to the inspection of persons invested by law with the rights of inspection and be maintained in its principal office within this State.80 Del. Laws, c. 159,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n567.
