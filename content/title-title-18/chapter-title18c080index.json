No director qualifies as “independent” unless the board of directors affirmatively determines that the director has no “material relationship” with the risk retention group. Each risk retention group shall disclose these determinations to its domestic regulator, at least annually. For this purpose, any person that is a direct or indirect owner of or subscriber in the risk retention group (or is an officer, director or employee of such an owner and insured, unless some other position of such officers, director or employee constitutes a “material relationship”), as contemplated by § 3901(a)(4)(E)(ii) of the Liability Risk Retention Act [15 U.S.C. § 3901(a)(4)(E)(ii)], is considered to be “independent.”b. “Material relationship” of a person with the risk retention group includes any of the following:1.

Such person or immediate family member of such person is not independent until 1 year after his or her compensation from the risk retention group falls below the threshold.2. A relationship with an auditor as follows: a director or an immediate family member of a director who is affiliated with or employed in a professional capacity by a present or former internal or external auditor of the risk retention group is not independent until 1 year after the end of the affiliation, employment or auditing relationship.3. A relationship with a related entity as follows: a director or immediate family member of a director who is employed as an executive officer of another company where any of the risk retention group’s present executives serve on that other company’s board of directors is not independent until 1 year after the end of such service or the employment relationship.(2)Service provider contracts. —The term of any material service provider contract with the risk retention group shall not exceed 5 years.

The service provider contract is deemed material if the amount to be paid for such contract is greater than or equal to 5% of the risk retention group’s annual gross written premium or 2% of the its surplus, whichever is greater.a.

Assure that all owners and insurers of the risk retention group receive evidence of ownership interest;b. Develop a set of governance standards applicable to the risk retention group;c.

Review and approve the amount to be paid for all material service providers; ande. Review and approve, at least annually:1. Risk retention group’s goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of officers and service providers;2. The officersʼ and service providersʼ performance in light of those goals and objectives; and3.
