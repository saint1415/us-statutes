He or she shall issue an order denying such application if he or she finds that the modification is not justified or that the resulting premiums would be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.(d) Each deviation permitted to be filed shall be effective continuously from the date of such permission unless terminated sooner with the approval of the Commissioner or until such time a modification is made to the deviation. All term policies issued pursuant to such deviations may remain in force until their expiring dates.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2518;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del.

Such application shall specify the grounds to be relied upon by the applicant.(b) If the Commissioner finds that the application is made in good faith, that the applicant would be so aggrieved if his or her grounds are established, and that such grounds otherwise justify holding such a hearing, he or she shall, within 30 days after receipt of such application, hold a hearing upon not less than 10 days’ written notice to the applicant and to every insurer and rating organization which made such filing.(c) If, after such hearing, the Commissioner finds that the filing does not meet the requirements of this chapter, he or she shall issue an order specifying in what respects he or she finds that such filing fails to meet the requirements of this chapter and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, such filing shall be deemed no longer effective. Copies of the order shall be sent to the applicant and to every such insurer and rating organization. The order shall not affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth in the order.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2520;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del.

C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2521;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2522. Advisory organizations.(a) Every group, association or other organization of insurers, whether located within or outside this State, which assists insurers which make their own filings or rating organizations in rate making, by the collection and furnishing of loss or expense statistics or by the submission of recommendations, but which does not make filings under this chapter shall be known as an advisory organization.(b) Every advisory organization shall file with the Commissioner:(1) A copy of its constitution, its articles of agreement or association or its certificate of incorporation and of its bylaws, rules and regulations governing its activities;(2) A list of its members; and(3) The name and address of a resident of this State upon whom notice or orders of the Commissioner or process issued at his or her direction may be served.(c) If, after a hearing, the Commissioner finds that the furnishing of such information or assistance involves any act or practice which is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, he or she may issue a written order specifying in what respects such act or practice is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter and requiring the discontinuance of such act or practice.(d) No insurer which makes its own filing nor any rating organization shall support its filings by statistics or adopt rate making recommendations, furnished to it by an advisory organization which has not complied with this section or with an order of the Commissioner involving such statistics or recommendations issued under subsection (c) of this section.

C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2522;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2523.

C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2523;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2524.

The reasonable costs of any such examination shall be paid by the rating organization, advisory organization or group, association or other organization examined upon presentation to it of a detailed account of such costs. The officers, manager, agent and employees of such rating organization, advisory organization or group, association or other organization may be examined at any time under oath and shall exhibit all books, records, accounts, documents or agreements governing its method of operation.(b) In lieu of any such examination the Commissioner may accept the report of an examination made by the insurance supervisory official of another state, pursuant to the laws of such state.(c) The provisions of § 325 of this title (examination report) apply as to such examinations.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2524;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2525. Recording and reporting of loss and expense experience.(a) The Commissioner shall promulgate reasonable rules and statistical plans, reasonably adapted to each of the rating systems on file with him or her, which may be modified from time to time and which shall be used hereafter by each insurer in the recording and reporting of its loss and countrywide expense experience in order that the experience of all insurers may be made available at least annually in such form and detail as may be necessary to aid him or her in determining whether rating systems comply with the standards set forth in § 2503 of this title. Such rules and plans may also provide for the recording and reporting of expense experience items which are specially applicable to this State and are not susceptible of determination by a prorating of countrywide expense experience.(b) In promulgating such rules and plans the Commissioner shall give due consideration to the rating systems on file with him or her and, in order that such rules and plans may be as uniform as is practicable among the several states, to the rules and to the form of the plans used for such rating systems in other states. No insurer shall be required to record or report its loss experience on a classification basis that is inconsistent with the rating system filed by it.(c) The Commissioner may designate 1 or more rating organizations or other agencies to assist him or her in gathering such experience and making compilations thereof, and such compilations shall be made available, subject to reasonable rules promulgated by the Commissioner, to insurers and rating organizations.(d) Each insurer shall report its loss or expense experience to the lawful rating organization or agency of which it is a member or subscriber but shall not be required to report its loss or expense experience to any rating organization or agency of which it is not a member or subscriber.

Interchange of rating plan data; consultation; cooperative action in rate making.(a) Reasonable rules and plans may be promulgated by the Commissioner for the interchange of data necessary for the application of rating plans.(b) In order to further uniform administration of rate regulatory laws, the Commissioner and every insurer and rating organization may exchange information and experience data with insurance supervisory officials, insurers and rating organizations in other states and may consult with them with respect to rate making and the application of rating systems.(c) Cooperation among rating organizations or among rating organizations and insurers in rate making or in other matters within the scope of this chapter is authorized, but the filings resulting from such cooperation are subject to all provisions of this chapter which are applicable to filings generally. The Commissioner may review such cooperative activities and practices and, if after a hearing he or she finds that any such activity or practice is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, he or she may issue a written order specifying in what respects such activity or practice is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter and requiring the discontinuance of such activity or practice.18 Del.
