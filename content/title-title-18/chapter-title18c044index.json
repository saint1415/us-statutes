To provide this protection, an association of member insurers is created to pay benefits and to continue coverage as limited in this chapter, and members of the Association are subject to assessment to provide funds to carry out the purpose of this chapter.63 Del.

The persons are not eligible for coverage by an association in any other state due to the fact that the insurer, managed care organization, or health maintenance organization was not licensed in the state at the time specified in the state’s guaranty association law.(3) For unallocated annuity contracts specified in subsection (b) of this section, paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section shall not apply, and this chapter shall (except as provided in paragraphs (a)(5) and (6) of this section) provide coverage to:a. Persons who are the owners of the unallocated annuity contracts if the contracts are issued to or in connection with a specific benefit plan whose plan sponsor has its principal place of business in this State; andb.

In order to avoid duplicate coverage, if a person who would otherwise receive coverage under this chapter is provided coverage under the laws of any other state, the person shall not be provided coverage under this chapter.

The premium shall reflect the amount of insurance to be provided and the age and class of risk of each insured, but shall not reflect any changes in the health of the insured after the original policy or contract was last underwritten.c. Any alternative policy or contract issued by the Association shall provide coverage of a type similar to that of the policy or contract issued by the impaired or insolvent insurer, as determined by the Association.(5) If the Association elects to reissue terminated coverage at a premium rate different from that charged under the terminated policy or contract, the premium shall be actuarially justified and set by the Association in accordance with the amount of insurance or coverage provided and the age and class of risk, subject to prior approval of the Commissioner.(6) The Association’s obligations with respect to coverage under any policy or contract of the impaired or insolvent insurer or under any reissued or alternative policy or contract shall cease on the date the coverage, policy, or contract is replaced by another similar policy or contract by the policy or contract owner, the insured, the enrollee, or the Association.(7) When proceeding under paragraph (b)(2) of this section with respect to a policy or contract carrying guaranteed minimum interest rates, the Association shall assure the payment or crediting of a rate of interest consistent with § 4403(b)(2)c. of this title.(c) Nonpayment of premiums within 31 days after the date required under the terms of any guaranteed, assumed, alternative, or reissued policy or contract or substitute coverage shall terminate the Association’s obligations under the policy, contract, or coverage under this chapter with respect to the policy, contract, or coverage, except with respect to any claims incurred or any net cash surrender value which may be due under this chapter.(d) (1) Premiums due for coverage after entry of an order of liquidation of an insolvent insurer shall belong to and be payable at the direction of the Association, and the Association shall be liable for unearned premiums due to policy or contract owners arising after the entry of the order.(2) If the liquidator of an insolvent insurer requests, the Association shall provide a report to the liquidator regarding such premiums collected by the Association.(e) The protection provided by this chapter shall not apply where any guaranty protection is provided to residents of this State by the laws of the domiciliary state or jurisdiction of the impaired or insolvent insurer other than this State.(f) In carrying out its duties under subsection (b) of this section, the Association may:(1) Subject to approval by a court in this State, impose permanent policy or contract liens in connection with a guarantee, assumption or reinsurance agreement if the Association finds that the amounts which can be assessed under this chapter are less than the amounts needed to assure full and prompt performance of the Association’s duties under this chapter or that the economic or financial conditions as they affect member insurers are sufficiently adverse to render the imposition of such permanent policy or contract liens to be in the public interest;(2) Subject to approval by a court in this State, impose temporary moratoriums or liens on payments of cash values and policy loans or any other right to withdraw funds held in conjunction with policies or contracts, in addition to any contractual provisions for deferral of cash or policy loan value. In addition, in the event of a temporary moratorium or moratorium charge imposed by the receivership court on payment of cash values or policy loans or on any other right to withdraw funds held in conjunction with policies or contracts out of the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer, the Association may defer the payment of cash values, policy loans or other rights by the Association for the period of the moratorium or moratorium charge imposed by the receivership court, except for claims covered by the Association to be paid in accordance with a hardship procedure established by the liquidator or rehabilitator and approved by the receivership court.(g) A deposit in this State held pursuant to law or required by the Commissioner for the benefit of creditors, including policy or contract owners, not turned over to the domiciliary liquidator upon the entry of a final order of liquidation or order approving a rehabilitation plan of a member insurer domiciled in this State or in a reciprocal state, shall be promptly paid to the Association. The Association shall be entitled to retain a portion of any amount so paid to it equal to the percentage determined by dividing the aggregate amount of policy or contract owners claims related to that insolvency for which the Association has provided statutory benefits by the aggregate amount of all policy or contract owners’ claims in this State related to that insolvency and shall remit to the domiciliary receiver the amount so paid to the Association less the amount retained pursuant to this subsection. Any amount so paid to the Association and retained by it shall be treated as a distribution of estate assets under § 5911 of this title or similar provision of the state of domicile of the impaired or insolvent insurer.(h) If the Association fails to act within a reasonable period of time with respect to an insolvent insurer, as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall have the powers and duties of the Association under this chapter with respect to the insolvent insurer.(i) The Association may render assistance and advice to the Commissioner, upon the Commissioner’s request, concerning rehabilitation, payment of claims, continuance of coverage, or the performance of other contractual obligations of an impaired or insolvent insurer.(j) The Association shall have standing to appear or intervene before a court or agency in this State with jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer concerning which the Association is or may become obligated under this chapter or with jurisdiction over any person or property against which the Association may have rights through subrogation or otherwise. Standing shall extend to all matters germane to the powers and duties of the Association, including proposals for reinsuring, reissuing, modifying, or guaranteeing the policies or contracts of the impaired or insolvent insurer and the determination of the policies or contracts and contractual obligations. The Association shall also have the right to appear or intervene before a court or agency in another state with jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer for which the Association is or may become obligated or with jurisdiction over any person or property against whom the Association may have rights through subrogation or otherwise.(k) (1) A person receiving benefits under this chapter shall be deemed to have assigned the rights under, and any causes of action against any person for losses arising under, resulting from or otherwise relating to, the covered policy or contract to the Association to the extent of the benefits received because of this chapter, whether the benefits are payments of or on account of contractual obligations, continuation of coverage, or provision of substitute or alternative policies, contracts, or coverages. The Association may require an assignment to it of such rights and cause of action by any enrollee, payee, policy or contract owner, beneficiary, insured, or annuitant as a condition precedent to the receipt of any right or benefits conferred by this chapter upon the person.(2) The subrogation rights of the Association under this subsection shall have the same priority against the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer as that possessed by the person entitled to receive benefits under this chapter.(3) In addition to paragraphs (k)(1) and (2) of this section, the Association shall have all common-law rights of subrogation and any other equitable or legal remedy that would have been available to the impaired or insolvent insurer or owner, beneficiary, enrollee, or payee of a policy or contract with respect to the policy or contracts, including in the case of a structured settlement annuity, any rights of the owner, beneficiary or payee of the annuity, to the extent of benefits received under this chapter, against a person originally or by succession responsible for the losses arising from the personal injury relating to the annuity or payment therefor, excepting any such person responsible solely by reason of serving as an assignee in respect of a qualified assignment under Internal Revenue Code § 130 [26 U.S.C. § 130].(4) If paragraphs (k)(1) through (k)(3) of this section are invalid or ineffective with respect to any person or claim for any reason, the amount payable by the Association with respect to the related covered obligations shall be reduced by the amount realized by any other person with respect to the person or claim that is attributable to the policies or contracts, or portion thereof, covered by the Association.(5) If the Association has provided benefits with respect to a covered obligation and a person recovers amounts as to which the Association has rights as described in paragraphs (k)(1) through (k)(4) of this section, the person shall pay to the Association the portion of the recovery attributable to the policies or contracts, or portion thereof, covered by the Association.(l) In addition to the rights and powers elsewhere in this chapter, the Association may:(1) Enter into such contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this chapter;(2) Sue or be sued, including taking any legal actions necessary or proper to recover any unpaid assessments under § 4409 of this title and to settle claims or potential claims against it;(3) Borrow money to effect the purposes of this chapter; any notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the Association not in default shall be legal investments for domestic member insurers and may be carried as admitted assets;(4) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary or appropriate to handle the financial transactions of the Association, and to perform such other functions as become necessary or proper under this chapter;(5) Take such legal action as may be necessary or appropriate to avoid or recover payment of improper claims;(6) Exercise, for the purposes of this chapter and to the extent approved by the Commissioner, the powers of a domestic life insurer, health insurer, managed care organization, or health maintenance organization; but in no case may the Association issue policies or contracts other than those issued to perform its obligations under this chapter;(7) Organize itself as a corporation or in other legal form permitted by the laws of this State;(8) Request information from a person seeking coverage from the Association in order to aid the Association in determining its obligations under this chapter with respect to the person; and the person shall promptly comply with the request;(9) Unless prohibited by law, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy or contract, file for actuarially justified rate or premium increases for any policy or contract for which it provides coverage under this chapter; and(10) Take other necessary or appropriate action to discharge its duties and obligations under this chapter or to exercise its powers under this chapter.(m) The Association may join an organization of 1 or more other state associations of similar purposes to further the purposes and administer the powers and duties of the Association.(n) (1) At any time within 180 days of the date of the order of liquidation, the Association may elect to succeed to the rights and obligations of the ceding member insurer that relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or part, by the Association, in each case under any 1 or more reinsurance contract or contracts entered into by the insolvent insurer and its reinsurers and selected by the Association. Any such assumption shall be effective as of the date of the order of liquidation. The election shall be effected by the Association or the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations (NOLHGA) on its behalf sending written notice, return receipt requested, to the affected reinsurers.(2) To facilitate the earliest practicable decision about whether to assume any of the contracts of reinsurance and to protect the financial position of the estate, the receiver and each reinsurer of the ceding member insurer shall make available, upon request, to the Association or to NOLHGA on its behalf as soon as possible after commencement of formal delinquency proceedings:a. Copies of in-force contracts of reinsurance and all related files and records relevant to the determination of whether such contracts should be assumed; andb. Notices of any defaults under the reinsurance contracts or any known event or condition which, with the passage of time, could become a default under the reinsurance contracts.(3) The following paragraphs (n)(3)a. through f. of this section shall apply to reinsurance contracts so assumed by the Association:a. The Association shall be responsible for all unpaid premiums due under the reinsurance contracts for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation, and shall be responsible for the performance of all other obligations to be performed after the date of the order of liquidation, in each case which relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or part, by the Association. The Association may charge policies, contracts, or annuities covered in part by the Association, through reasonable allocation methods, the costs for reinsurance in excess of the obligations of the Association and shall provide notice and an accounting of these charges to the liquidator.b. The Association shall be entitled to any and all amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods after the date of the order of liquidation and that relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or part, by the Association, if, upon receipt of any such amounts the Association shall be obligated to pay to the beneficiary under the policy, contract, or annuity on account of which the amounts were paid a portion of the amount equal to the lesser of:1. The amount received by the Association; and2. The excess of the amount received by the Association, over the amount equal to the benefits paid by the Association on account of the policy, contract, or annuity less the retention of the insurer applicable to the loss or event.c. Within 30 days following the Association’s election (the “election date”), the Association and each reinsurer under contracts assumed by the Association shall calculate the net balance due to or from the Association under each reinsurance contract as of the election date with respect to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or part, by the Association, which calculation shall give full credit to all items paid by either the member insurer or its receiver or the reinsurer before the election date. The reinsurer shall pay the receiver any amounts due for losses or events before the date of the order of liquidation, subject to any set-off for premiums unpaid for periods prior to the date, and the Association or reinsurer shall pay any remaining balance due the other, in each case within 5 days of the completion of the aforementioned calculation. Any disputes over the amounts due to either the Association or the reinsurer shall be resolved by arbitration under the terms of the affected reinsurance contracts or, if the contract contains no arbitration clause, as otherwise provided by law. If the receiver has received any amounts due the Association under paragraph (n)(3)b. of this section, the receiver shall remit the same to the Association as promptly as practicable.d. 1. If the Association or the receiver, on the Associations’ behalf, within 60 days of the election date, pays the unpaid premiums due for periods both before and after the election date that relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or part, by the Association, the reinsurer shall not be entitled to terminate the reinsurance contracts for failure to pay a premium insofar as the reinsurance contracts relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or part, by the Association, and shall not be entitled to set off any unpaid amounts due under other contracts, or unpaid amounts due from parties other than the Association, against amounts due the Association.2. During the period from the date of the order of liquidation until the election date, or, if the election date does not occur, until 180 days after the date of the order of liquidation:A. I. Neither the Association nor the reinsurer shall have any rights or obligations under reinsurance contracts that the Association has the right to assume under paragraph (n)(1) of this section, whether for periods before or after the date of the order of liquidation; andII. The reinsurer, the receiver, and the Association shall, to the extent practicable, provide each other data and records reasonably requested;B. Provided that once the Association has elected to assume a reinsurance contract, the parties’ rights and obligations shall be governed by paragraph (n)(1) of this section.3. If the Association does not elect to assume a reinsurance contract by the election date under paragraph (n)(1) of this section, the Association shall have no rights or obligations, in each case for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation, with respect to the reinsurance contract.4. When policies, contracts, or annuities, or covered obligations with respect thereto, are transferred to an assuming insurer, reinsurance on the policies, contracts, or annuities may also be transferred by the Association, in the case of contracts assumed under paragraph (n)(1) of this section, subject to the following:A. Unless the reinsurer and the assuming insurer agree otherwise, the reinsurance contract that is transferred shall not cover any new policies of insurance, contracts, or annuities in addition to those transferred;B. The obligations described in paragraph (n)(3)d.1. of this section shall no longer apply with respect to matters arising after the effective date of the transfer; andC. Notice shall be given in writing, return receipt requested, by the transferring party to the affected reinsurer not less than 30 days before the effective date of the transfer.e. The provisions of this subsection (n) shall supersede the provisions of any state law or of any affected reinsurance contract that provides for or requires any payment of reinsurance proceeds, on account of losses or events that occur in periods after the date of the order of liquidation, to the receiver of the insolvent insurer or any other person. The receiver shall remain entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods before the date of the order of liquidation, subject to applicable setoff provisions.f. Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this subsection (n) shall:1. Alter or modify the terms and conditions of any reinsurance contract;2. Abrogate or limit any rights of any reinsurer to claim that it is entitled to rescind a reinsurance contract;3. Provide a policyholder, contract owner, enrollee, certificate holder, or beneficiary with an independent cause of action against a reinsurer that is not otherwise set forth in the reinsurance contract;4. Limit or affect the Association’s rights as a creditor of the estate against the assets of the estate;5. Apply to reinsurance agreements covering property or casualty risks.(o) The Board of Directors of the Association shall have discretion and may exercise reasonable business judgment to determine the means by which the Association is to provide the benefits of this chapter in an economical and efficient manner.(p) Where the Association has arranged or offered to provide the benefits of this chapter to a covered person under a plan or arrangement that fulfills the Association’s obligations under this chapter, the person shall not be entitled to benefits from the Association in addition to or other than those provided under the plan or arrangement.(q) Venue in a suit against the Association arising under the chapter shall be in New Castle County. The Association shall not be required to give an appeal bond in an appeal that relates to a cause of action arising under this chapter.(r) In carrying out its duties in connection with guaranteeing, assuming, reissuing, or reinsuring policies or contracts under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the Association may issue substitute coverage for a policy or contract that provides an interest rate, crediting rate, or similar factor determined by use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract employed in calculating returns or changes in value by issuing an alternative policy or contract in accordance with the following provisions:(1) In lieu of the index or other external reference provided for in the original policy or contract, the alternative policy or contract provides for:a. A fixed interest rate; orb. Payment of dividends with minimum guarantees; orc. A different method for calculating interest or changes in value;(2) There is no requirement for evidence of insurability, waiting period, or other exclusion that would not have applied under the replaced policy or contract; and(3) The alternative policy or contract is substantially similar to the replaced policy or contract in all other materials terms.63 Del.

Assessments.(a) For the purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the Association, the Board of Directors shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at such time and for such amounts as the Board finds necessary. Assessments shall be due not less than 30 days after prior written notice to the member insurers and shall accrue interest at 10% per annum on and after the due date.(b) There shall be 3 classes of assessment as follows:(1) Class A assessments, shall be authorized and called for the purpose of meeting administrative costs and other expenses. Class A assessments may be authorized and called whether or not related to a particular impaired or insolvent insurer.(2) Class B assessments shall be authorized and called annually to provide for the oversight activity of the Commissioner, thereby minimizing the need to make class C assessments.(3) Class C assessments shall be authorized and called to the extent necessary to carry out the duties of the Association under this title with regards to an impaired or insolvent member insurer.(c) (1) a. The amount of any class A assessment shall be determined by the Board and may be authorized and called on a pro rata or non-pro rata basis. If pro rata, the Board may provide that it be credited against future class C assessments.b. The amount of class C assessment, except for assessments relating to long-term care insurance, shall be allocated for assessment purposes between the accounts and among the subaccounts of the life insurance and annuity account under an allocation formula which may be based on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or any other standard deemed by the Board in its sole discretion as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances.c. The amount of the class C assessment for long-term care insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer must be allocated according to a methodology included in the plan of operation and approved by the Commissioner. The methodology must provide for 50% of the assessment to be allocated to accident and health member insurers and 50% to be allocated to life and annuity member insurers.(2) The amount of a class B assessment shall be determined by the Commissioner who shall so notify the Association not later than July 31 of the calendar year in which the assessment is to be made. A class B assessment may be made on a non-pro rata basis, but the amount shall not exceed1/10of 1% of the members’ premium written during the calendar year preceding the assessment. The amount assessed in conjunction with class C assessments shall not result in members being assessed more than 2% of the premiums written in the applicable year. The proceeds of this assessment shall be paid by the Association into the Commissioner’s Regulatory Revolving Fund.(3) Class C assessments against member insurers for each account and subaccount shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this State by each assessed member insurer on policies or contracts covered by each account for the 3 most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the member insurer became impaired or insolvent, as the case may be, bears to such premiums received in this State for such calendar years by all assessed member insurers.(4) Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the Association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer shall not be authorized or called until necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter. Classification of assessments under subsection (b) of this section and computation of assessments under this subsection shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determination may not always be possible. The Association shall notify each member insurer of its anticipated pro rata share of an authorized assessment not yet called within 180 days after the assessment is authorized.(d) The Association may abate or defer, in whole or part, the assessment of the member insurer if, in the opinion of the Board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. If an assessment against a member insurer is abated or deferred in whole or part, the amount by which such assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments under this section. Once the conditions which caused a deferral have been removed or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were deferred pursuant to a repayment plan approved by the Association.(e) (1) a. Subject to paragraph (e)(1)b. of this section, the total of all assessments authorized by the Association with respect to a member insurer for each subaccount of the life insurance and annuity account and for the health account shall not in 1 calendar year exceed 2% of that member insurer’s average annual premiums received in this State on the policies and contracts covered by the subaccount or account during the 3 calendar years preceding the year in which the member insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer.b. If 2 or more assessments are authorized in 1 calendar year with respect to member insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different calendar years, the average annual premiums for purposes of the aggregate assessment percentage limitation referenced in paragraph (e)(1)a. of this section shall be equal and limited to the higher of the 3-year average annual premiums for the applicable subaccount or account as calculated under this section.c. If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the Association in an account, does not provide in 1 year in either account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the Association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this chapter.(2) The Board may provide in the plan of operation a method of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to 1 or more impaired or insolvent insurers, when the maximum assessment will be insufficient to cover anticipated claims.(3) If the maximum assessment for any subaccount of the life and annuity account in any 1 year does not provide an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the Association, then under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the Board shall assess all subaccounts of the life and annuity account for the necessary additional amount, subject to the maximum stated in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.(f) The Board may, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the Board finds is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the Association with regard to that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subrogation, net realized gains, and income from investments. A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the Association and for future claims.(g) It shall be proper for any member insurer, in determining its premium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance, managed care organization, or health maintenance organization business within the scope of this chapter, consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under this chapter.(h) The Association shall issue to each member insurer paying a class C assessment a certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the Commissioner, for the amount of the assessment so paid. All outstanding certificates shall be given equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contribution may be shown by the member insurer in its financial statement as an asset in such form and for such amount, if any, and period of time as the Commissioner may approve.(i) (1) A member insurer that wishes to protest all or part of an assessment shall pay when due the full amount of the assessment as set forth in the notice provided by the Association. The payment shall be available to meet Association obligations during the pendency of the protest or any subsequent appeal. Payment shall be accompanied by a statement in writing that the payment is made under protest and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds for the protest.(2) Within 60 days following the payment of an assessment under protest by a member insurer, the Association shall notify the member insurer in writing of its determination with respect to the protest unless the Association notifies the member insurer that additional time is required to resolve the issues raised by the protest.(3) Within 30 days after a final decision has been made, the Association shall notify the protesting member insurer in writing of that final decision. Within 60 days of receipt of notice of the final decision, the protesting member insurer may appeal that final action to the Commissioner.(4) In the alternative to rendering a final decision with respect to a protest based on a question regarding the assessment base, the Association may refer protests to the Commissioner for a final decision, with or without a recommendation from the Association.(5) If the protest or appeal on the assessment is upheld, the amount paid in error or excess shall be returned to the member insurer. Interest on a refund due a protesting member insurer shall be paid at the rate actually earned by the Association.(j) The Association may request information of member insurers in order to aid in the exercise of its power under this section and member insurers shall promptly comply with a request.63 Del.

Plan of operation.(a) (1) The Association shall submit to the Commissioner a plan of operation and any amendments thereto necessary or suitable to assure the fair, reasonable and equitable administration of the Association. The plan of operation and any amendments thereto shall become effective upon approval in writing by the Commissioner.(2) If the Association fails to submit a suitable plan of operation within 180 days following July 23, 1982, or if at any time thereafter the Association fails to submit suitable amendments to the plan, the Commissioner shall, after notice and hearing, adopt and promulgate such reasonable rules as are necessary or advisable to effectuate this chapter. Such rules shall continue in force until modified by the Commissioner or superseded by a plan submitted by the Association and approved by the Commissioner.(b) All member insurers shall comply with the plan of operation.(c) The plan of operation shall, in addition to requirements enumerated elsewhere in this chapter:(1) Establish procedures for handling the assets of the Association;(2) Establish the amount and method of reimbursing members of the Board of Directors under § 4407 of this title;(3) Establish regular places and times for meetings of the Board of Directors;(4) Establish procedures for records to be kept of all financial transactions of the Association, its agents and the Board of Directors;(5) Establish the procedures whereby selections for the Board of Directors will be made and submitted to the Commissioner;(6) Establish any additional procedures for assessments under § 4409 of this title;(7) Contain additional provisions necessary or proper for the execution of the powers and duties of the Association;(8) Establish procedures whereby a Director may be removed for cause, including the case where a member insurer Director becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer; and(9) Require the Board of Directors to establish policy and procedures for addressing conflicts of interest.(d) The plan of operation may provide that any or all powers and duties of the Association, except those under §§ 4408(l)(3) and 4409 of this title, are delegated to a corporation, association or other organization which performs or will perform functions similar to those of this Association, or its equivalent, in 2 or more states. Such a corporation, association or organization shall be reimbursed for any payments made on behalf of the Association and shall be paid for its performance of any function of the Association. A delegation under this subsection shall take effect only with the approval of both the Board of Directors and the Commissioner, and may be made only to a corporation, association or organization which extends protection not substantially less favorable and effective than that provided by this chapter.63 Del. Laws, c. 442,\n\n§\n\n 1;77 Del. Laws, c. 215,\n\n§\n\n 11;§\n\n4411. Duties and powers of Commissioner.In addition to the duties and powers enumerated elsewhere in this chapter:(1) The Commissioner shall:a. Upon request of the Board of Directors, provide the Association with a statement of the premiums in the appropriate states for each member insurer;b. When an impairment is declared and the amount of the impairment is determined, serve a demand upon the impaired insurer to make good the impairment within a reasonable time. Notice to the impaired insurer shall constitute notice to its shareholders, if any. The failure of the impaired insurer to promptly comply with such demand shall not excuse the Association from the performance of its powers and duties under this chapter; andc. In any liquidation or rehabilitation proceeding involving a domestic insurer, be appointed as the liquidator or rehabilitator. If a foreign or alien member insurer is subject to a liquidation proceeding in its domiciliary jurisdiction or state of entry, the Commissioner shall be appointed conservator.(2) The Commissioner may suspend or revoke, after notice and hearing, the certificate of authority to transact business in this State of any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation. Alternatively, the Commissioner may levy a forfeiture of any insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due. Such forfeiture shall not exceed 5% of the unpaid assessment per month, but no forfeiture shall be less than $100 per month.(3) A final action of the Board of Directors or the Association may be appealed to the Commissioner by a member insurer if the appeal is taken within 60 days of its receipt of notice of the final action being appealed. A final action or order of the Commissioner shall be subject to judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the laws of this State that apply to the actions or orders of the Commissioner.(4) The liquidator, rehabilitator, or conservator of any impaired insurer may notify all interested persons of the effect of this chapter.63 Del. Laws, c. 442,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 547,\n\n§\n\n 5;73 Del. Laws, c. 327,\n\n§\n\n 6;82 Del. Laws, c. 113,\n\n§\n\n6;§\n\n4412.

Such report and the information contained therein shall be kept confidential by the Board of Directors until such time as made public by the Commissioner or other lawful authority.(2) The Commissioner may seek the advice and recommendations of the Board of Directors concerning any matter affecting the Commissioner’s duties and responsibilities regarding the financial condition of member insurers and insurers, managed care organizations, or health maintenance organizations seeking admission to transact business in this State.(3) The Board of Directors may, upon majority vote, make reports and recommendations to the Commissioner upon any matter germane to the solvency, liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation of any member insurer or germane to the solvency of any insurer, managed care organization, or health maintenance organization seeking to do business in this State. Such reports and recommendations shall not be considered public documents.(4) It shall be the duty of the Board of Directors, upon majority vote, to notify the Commissioner of any information indicating any member insurer may be an impaired or insolvent insurer.(5) The Board of Directors may, upon majority vote, request that the Commissioner order an examination of any member insurer which the Board in good faith believes may be an impaired or insolvent member insurer. Within 30 days of the receipt of such request, the Commissioner shall begin such examination. The examination may be conducted as a National Association of Insurance Commissioners examination or may be conducted by such persons as the Commissioner designates. The cost of such examination shall be paid by the Association and the examination report shall be treated as are other examination reports. In no event shall such examination report be released to the Board of Directors before its release to the public, but this shall not preclude the Commissioner from complying with paragraph (1) of this section.

The request for an examination shall be kept on file by the Commissioner but it shall not be open to public inspection before the release of the examination report to the public.(6) The Board of Directors may, upon majority vote, make recommendations to the Commissioner for the detection and prevention of member insurer insolvencies.(7) The Board of Directors shall, at the conclusion of any member insurer insolvency in which the Association was obligated to pay covered claims, prepare a report to the Commissioner containing such information as it may have in its possession bearing on the history and causes of such insolvency. The Board shall cooperate with the boards of directors of guaranty associations in other states in preparing a report on the history and causes for insolvency of a particular member insurer, and may adopt by reference any report prepared by such other associations.63 Del. Laws, c. 442,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;82 Del. Laws, c. 113,\n\n§\n\n7;§\n\n4413. Credits for assessments paid.(a) A member insurer may offset against its premium tax liability to this State an assessment described in § 4409(h) of this title to the extent of 20 percent of the amount of such assessment for each of the 5 calendar years following the year in which such assessment was paid. If a member insurer should cease doing business, all uncredited assessments may be credited against its premium tax liability for the year it ceases doing business.(b) Any sums acquired by refund, under § 4409(f) of this title, from the Association which have theretofore been written off by contributing insurers and offset against premium, franchise, or income taxes as provided in subsection (a) of this section and are not then needed for purposes of this chapter, shall be paid by the Association to the Commissioner and deposited by the Commissioner with the State Treasurer for credit to the General Fund of this State.63 Del. Laws, c. 442,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;82 Del. Laws, c. 113,\n\n§\n\n8;§\n\n4414. Liability for unpaid assessments; Association records; Association as creditor; liquidation proceeding.(a) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to reduce the liability for unpaid assessments of the insureds on an impaired or insolvent insurer operating under a plan with assessment liability.(b) Records shall be kept of all meetings of the Board of Directors to discuss the activities of the Association in carrying out its powers and duties under § 4408 of this title. The records of the Association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer shall not be disclosed prior to the liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation proceeding involving the impaired or insolvent insurer, except upon the termination of the impairment or insolvency of the insurer or upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the duty of the Association to render a report of its activities under § 4415 of this title.(c) For the purpose of carrying out its obligations under this chapter, the Association shall be deemed to be a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to covered policies reduced by any amounts to which the Association is entitled as subrogee under § 4408(k) of this title. Assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies shall be used to continue all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer as required by this chapter. Assets attributable to covered policies or contracts, as used in this subsection, is that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for such policies or contracts bear to the reserves that should have been established for all policies of insurance or health benefit plans written by the impaired or insolvent insurer.(d) As a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer as established in subsection (c) of this section and consistent with § 5911 of this title, the Association and other similar associations shall be entitled to receive a disbursement of assets out of the marshaled assets, from time to time as the assets become available to reimburse it, as a credit against contractual obligations under this chapter. If the liquidator has not, within 120 days of a final determination of insolvency of a member insurer by the receivership court, made an application to the court for the approval of a proposal to disburse assets out of marshaled assets to guaranty associations having obligations because of the insolvency, then the Association shall be entitled to make application to the receivership court for approval of its own proposal to disburse these assets.(e) (1) Before the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties, including the Association, the shareholders, contract owners, certificate holders, enrollees, and policy owners of the insolvent insurer, and any other party with a bond fide interest, in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of such insolvent insurer. In such a determination, consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policyholders, policy owners, contract owners, certificate holders, and enrollees of the continuing or successor member insurer.(2) No distribution to stockholders, if any, of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall be made until and unless the total amount of valid claims of the Association for funds expended in carrying out its powers and duties under § 4408 of this title with respect to such member insurer have been fully recovered by the Association.(f) (1) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a member insurer domiciled in this State has been entered, the receiver appointed under such order shall have a right to recover on behalf of the member insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the member insurer on its capital stock made at any time during the 5 years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the limitations of paragraphs (f)(2) through (4) of this section.(2) No such dividend shall be recoverable if the member insurer shows that, when paid, the distribution was lawful and reasonable and that the member insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.(3) Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the member insurer at the time the distributions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions that person received. Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the member insurer at the time the distributions were declared shall be liable up to the amount of distributions that person would have received if they had been paid immediately. If 2 persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable.(4) The maximum amount recoverable under this subsection shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer.(5) If any person liable under paragraph (f)(3) of this section is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the dividend was paid shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate.63 Del.
