This shall be called the “claims fund account.” The remaining net premium shall be placed into a designated depository for the payment of taxes, general regulatory fees and assessments and administrative costs. This shall be called the “administrative fund account.” The Commissioner may approve an administrative fund account of more than 30% and a claims fund account of less than 70% only if the group shows to the Commissioner’s satisfaction that:1. More than 30% is needed for an effective safety and loss control program; or2. The group’s aggregate excess insurance attaches at less than 70%.b.

Membership takes effect no earlier than each member’s date of approval.The application for membership and its approval shall be maintained as permanent records of the board of trustees.(b) Individual members of a group shall be subject to cancellation by the group pursuant to the by-laws of the group.

A member who elects to terminate its membership or is canceled by a group remains jointly and severally liable for workers’ compensation obligations of the group and its members which were incurred during the canceled or terminated member’s period of membership.(d) A group member is not relieved of its workers’ compensation liabilities incurred during its period of membership except through payment by the group or the member of required workers’ compensation benefits.(e) The insolvency or bankruptcy of a member does not relieve the group or any other member of liability for the payment of any workers’ compensation benefits incurred during the insolvent or bankrupt member’s period of membership.70 Del.

If the Commissioner determines that, as a result of an improper classification, a member’s premium contribution is insufficient, the commissioner shall order the group to assess that member an amount equal to the deficiency. If the Commissioner determines that, as a result of an improper classification, a member’s premium is excessive, the commissioner shall order the group to refund to the member the excess collected. The audit shall be at the expense of the group.70 Del. Laws, c. 540,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n417.

A refund for any fund year shall be paid only to those employers who remain participants in the group for the entire fund year.

The Commissioner shall have the same powers and limitations in such proceedings as are provided under those laws.(f) In the event of delinquency proceedings against a group, the Commissioner may levy an assessment upon its members for such an amount as the Commissioner determines to be necessary to discharge all liabilities of the group, including the reasonable cost of liquidation or rehabilitation.70 Del. Laws, c. 540,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n420. Guaranty mechanism.In the event of a liquidation pursuant to § 419 of this title, after exhausting the security required pursuant to § 404(b)(2) of this title, the Commissioner may levy an assessment against all groups to assure prompt payment of benefits. The assessment on each group shall be based on the proportion that the premium of each group bears to the total premium of all groups. The Commissioner may exempt a group from assessment upon finding that the payment of the assessment would render the group insolvent. The assessment shall not relieve any member of an insolvent group of its joint and several liability. After an assessment is made, the Commissioner shall take action to enforce the joint and several liability provisions of the insolvent group’s indemnity agreement, and shall recoup:(1) All costs incurred by the Commissioner in enforcing such joint and several liability provisions;(2) Amounts that the Commissioner assessed any other groups pursuant to this section; and(3) Any obligations included within § 419(f) of this title.70 Del.

If exigent circumstances are present, the person or group will be offered a hearing within 10 days after the issuance of the order.(b) Upon a finding, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that any person or group has violated any cease and desist order, the Commissioner may do any or all of the following:(1) Impose a monetary penalty of not more than $15,000, in the case of an individual, or not more than $50,000, in the case of a group or corporation, for each and every act or violation of the order; or(2) Revoke or suspend the group’s certificate of authority or any insurance license held by the person; or(3) Place the group or person under supervision; or(4) Permanently enjoin the conduct or enter any remedial order.70 Del.
