Require the founders, promoters, incorporators or other persons directly involved in the proposed offering to subscribe and pay for, immediately and in cash, a reasonable proportion of the same securities as proposed to be offered in this State, at a price not less than that at which any such securities are to be offered to other subscribers or purchasers;b. Prohibit, limit or control the granting of options to such founders, promoters, incorporators or other persons to buy the securities;c. Prohibit, by any founder, promoter, incorporator or other person associated or to be associated in solicitations under the permit, the resale or transfer for a period terminating 1 year after expiration, or other termination of the permit, of such person’s interest in any security, right or interest of the kind proposed to be offered under the permit or any other security, interest or right which such person may have in or as to the same issuing entity or the granting of any option or lien as to any such security, right or interest. The Commissioner may, require that any security, right or interest of which the resale or transfer is herein prohibited, shall be deposited and held in escrow for the prescribed period. This provision shall not prohibit the sale or transfer of any such security, right or interest by the estate or personal representative of a deceased founder, promoter or incorporator or deceased person associated in solicitations under the permit;d. Contain other reasonable provisions for the protection of existing or proposed investors in this State;(6) If the permit is issued in connection with the solicitation of qualifying applications for a proposed domestic mutual insurer, it shall limit the portion of funds received therefor which may be used for organization and sales expense to a reasonable commission related to the kind of insurance policy involved and costs incurred by mutual insurers in Delaware in the production of similar business and provide that no such commissions shall be paid or be deemed earned until the insurer has received its certificate of authority and the policies so applied for have been actually issued, delivered to and accepted by the respective insureds;(7) The permit shall expire after a period stated therein, which period shall be not more than 2 years after its date of issue, unless earlier terminated by the Commissioner, but subject to an extension of time for such additional reasonable period, not to exceed 1 year, as the Commissioner may grant for good cause shown;(8) The permit shall contain such other reasonable conditions relative to accounting, reports, deposits or other matters consistent with this chapter as the Commissioner deems advisable for the reasonable protection of existing or prospective investors.(c) The holder of the permit and its directors, officers, employees, agents, founders, promoters, incorporators and representatives shall comply with the terms of the permit.18 Del.

Permit as inducement.The granting of a solicitation permit is permissive only and shall not constitute an endorsement by the Commissioner of any person or thing related to any such insurer, corporation, syndicate, association, firm, organization or financing nor constitute evidence of the completeness or accuracy of information presented in any prospectus or other sales literature, and the existence of the permit shall not be advertised or used as an inducement in any solicitation. The Commissioner shall place the substance of this section in conspicuous type at the top of each such permit issued.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4710;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4711. Prospectus required; other literature.(a) An offering of securities under a solicitation permit shall be made only by a written prospectus delivered to the prospective investor.(b) The prospectus shall make a disclosure of all facts relative to the issuer and the offered security which are reasonably material to the offered investment and shall not omit a material fact necessary to make the statements clear, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made. The Commissioner may make reasonable rules and regulations concerning the form and contents of prospectuses not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.(c) The Commissioner may accept, as a compliance with this section, a prospectus or offering circular covering securities to be offered in this State under an existing registration thereof with the Securities and Exchange Commission or under an existing exemption from such registration pursuant to “Regulation A” of the general rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended [15 U.S.C. § 77a et seq.].(d) As to securities covered by a solicitation permit, no sales literature or other visual sales material, other than the prospectus or offering circular, shall be used in solicitations unless a copy of the same has been filed with the Commissioner in advance of such use and not disapproved by the Commissioner in writing, mailed or delivered to the filing party within 10 days after the date of such filing. The Commissioner shall disapprove any such literature or material found to be untrue or misleading. This provision shall not be deemed to modify or affect any applicable requirement or prohibition under or pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. § 77a et seq.], as amended.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4711;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4712. Modification or revocation of permit.The Commissioner may, for cause, modify a solicitation permit theretofore issued, or may, after a hearing thereon, revoke the permit for violation of law or of the terms of the permit or any proper order of the Commissioner or for material misrepresentation in the offering or sale of securities or policies under the permit.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4712;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4713. Bond for permit.(a) The Commissioner shall not issue a solicitation permit until the applicant therefor has filed with the Commissioner a corporate surety bond in the penalty of $10,000, aggregate amount, in favor of the State and for the use and benefit of the State and of proposed Delaware investors in and creditors of the permittee.(b) The bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of costs incurred by the State in event of any proceeding for liquidation or dissolution of the proposed organization before completion of organization or if a certificate of authority to be an insurer is not granted; and upon a full accounting for funds received until the proposed insurer has been granted its certificate of authority or until the corporation, syndicate, association, firm or organization or financing has been completed within the terms of the permit.(c) In lieu of filing such bond the applicant may deposit with the State Treasurer, through the Commissioner, $10,000 in cash or a certificate of deposit issued by a bank located in Delaware or an equivalent amount in United States government bonds at market value to be held in trust under the same conditions as required of the bond. The amount so deposited may be credited toward payment of subscription to securities by founders, promoters and incorporators if required under § 4709(b)(5)a. of this title.(d) The Commissioner may waive the requirement for a bond or deposit in lieu thereof if the securities are to be issued in connection with subsequent financing as provided in § 4717 of this title.(e) The Commissioner shall release and discharge any such bond or deposit or remaining portion thereof held under this section upon written request of the person entitled thereto and upon proof to the Commissioner’s satisfaction that all liabilities and obligations with respect to which the bond or deposit was filed or made have been fully settled or terminated or otherwise adequately provided for.(f) This section does not apply as to solicitation of initial qualifying applications for insurance in a domestic mutual insurer pursuant to § 4906 of this title, except as provided in such § 4906.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4713;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4714. Escrow of funds.(a) The holder of the solicitation permit shall promptly deposit all funds received from an offering of securities in this State pursuant to the permit, other than advance premiums for insurance which are subject to § 4907 of this title, in escrow in a bank or trust company located in this State and under an agreement consistent with this chapter approved by the Commissioner.(b) No part of such funds shall be withdrawn from such deposit except:(1) For payment of organization, sales and promotion expenses as earned and as authorized by the permit, and funds for such purposes may be withheld from the deposit; or(2) For the purpose of making any deposit with the Commissioner required for issuance of a certificate of authority to an insurer or, if the organization is not or is not to be, an insurer, upon completion of payments on securities subscriptions made under the permit and deposit or appropriation of such funds to the purposes specified in the permit; or(3) For the making of refunds as provided in § 4716 of this title.(c) Funds while so held in escrow may be invested in certificates of deposit or savings accounts. Interest accruing thereon shall become part of the funds released as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section above, or shall be applied toward the costs of making refunds under paragraph (b)(3) of this section above, or to supplement the bond or deposit in lieu thereof in the event the same is called on pursuant to § 4713 of this title.(d) When the Commissioner has issued a certificate of authority to a proposed insurer, any such funds remaining in escrow for its account shall be released to the insurer.(e) The Commissioner may waive compliance with this section as to funds to be received under a subsequent financing permit under § 4717 of this title or in other circumstances where the Commissioner deems such an escrow to be reasonably unnecessary for the protection of investors or of the public.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4714;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4715. Subscriptions.All subscriptions to securities under a solicitation permit shall be binding upon and enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with the terms of the subscription contract and subject to the provisions of this chapter. No such contract shall be made conditional except upon such reasonable conditions consistent with applicable statutes as may uniformly be set forth in all such contracts with the Commissioner’s approval as not being inappropriate or inequitable.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4715;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4716. Failure to complete or qualify.(a) The Commissioner shall withdraw all funds held in escrow under § 4714 of this title and refund to securities subscribers or purchasers all sums paid therein under the solicitation permit, less that part allowed and used for organization, sales and promotion expenses, if:(1) The permit holder has failed to complete its organization or financing within the terms of the permit or if it has failed to secure its certificate of authority to be an insurer, all before expiration of the permit; or(2) The permit is revoked.(b) As to funds paid in on subscriptions by founders, promoters and incorporators and held on deposit in lieu of bond under § 4713(c) of this title, only such portion of such funds shall be refundable under this section as may remain after discharge of all liabilities against the deposit under § 4713 of this title and after the charging of such funds with a proportionate share of organization, sales and promotion expenses.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4716;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4717. Subsequent financing; penalty.(a) No person referred to in § 4702 (solicitation permit required; penalty) of this title, after receiving a certificate of authority, if an insurer in this or any other State or after completing its original organization and financing, if other than an insurer, shall in this State solicit or receive funds in exchange for its securities until it has applied to the Commissioner for and has been granted a solicitation permit. This provision is subject to the same exemptions as are provided by § 4704 of this title.(b) The Commissioner shall expeditiously issue such a permit unless the Commissioner finds:(1) That the funds proposed to be secured are inadequate or excessive in amount for the purposes intended; or(2) That the proposed securities or the manner of their distribution would be unfair or inequitable to existing or proposed security holders or policyholders of the issuer.(c) Any such permit granted by the Commissioner shall be for such duration and shall contain such terms and be issued upon such conditions as the Commissioner may reasonably specify or require for the protection of existing or proposed investors. In the Commissioner’s discretion, such terms and conditions may be substantially the same as or materially different from requirements made under this chapter as to solicitation permits for initial financing.(d) Violation of subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to the same penalties as prescribed by § 4702(b) (solicitation permit required; penalty) of this title.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4717;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;",
