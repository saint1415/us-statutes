The Court may proceed in the action in a summary manner or otherwise. It may grant injunctive relief and appoint a receiver, with power to sue for, collect, receive and take into his or her possession all the goods and chattels, rights and credits, moneys and effects, lands and tenement, books, papers, choses in action, bills, notes and property of every description belonging to the dental plan organization and sell and convey and assign the same, and authorize the purchase of continuing coverage for enrollees utilizing the remaining assets, and hold and dispose of the proceeds thereof.
