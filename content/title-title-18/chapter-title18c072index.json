Any adjustment due to change in coverage or change in the case characteristics of the small employer as determined from the carrier’s rate manual for the class of business.(8) a. Small employer carriers shall apply rating factors, including case characteristics, consistently with respect to all small employers in a class of business. Rating factors shall produce premiums for identical groups which differ only by the amounts attributable to plan design and do not reflect differences due to the nature of the groups assumed to select particular health benefit plans.b. A small employer carrier shall treat all health benefit plans issued or renewed in the same calendar month as having the same rating period.(9) For purposes of this subsection, a health benefit plan that utilizes a restricted provider network shall not be considered similar coverage to a health benefit plan that does not utilize such a network, provided that utilization of the restricted provider network results in substantial differences in claims costs.68 Del. Laws, c. 175,\n\n§\n\n 1;68 Del. Laws, c. 340,\n\n§\n\n 1;71 Del. Laws, c. 143,\n\n§\n\n 6;§\n\n7206.

Not be in the best interests of the policyholders or certificate holders;b. Impair the carrier’s ability to meet its contractual obligations.In such instance the Commissioner shall assist affected small employers in finding replacement coverage;(8) With respect to a carrier that offers a health benefit plan through a managed care plan, there is no longer any enrollee in connection with such plan that lives, resides or works in the service area of the carrier;(9) An employer is no longer actively engaged in the business in which it was engaged on the effective date of the plan; or(10) With respect to coverage that is made available only through 1 or more bona fide associations, the membership of an employer ceases.(b) A small employer carrier that elects not to renew a health benefit plan under paragraph (a)(6) of this section shall be prohibited from writing new business in the small employer market in this State for a period of 5 years from the date of notice to the Commissioner.(c) In the case of a small employer carrier doing business in 1 established geographic service area of the State, the rules set forth in this chapter shall apply only to the carrier’s operations in that service area.68 Del.
