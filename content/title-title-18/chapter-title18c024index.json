Laws, c. 463,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2411. Enforcement, investigations, hearings, administrative penalties and appeals.(a) The matters of enforcement, investigations, hearings, administrative penalties and appeals shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 3 of this title and Chapter 101 of Title 29 to the extent that such provisions are not in conflict with the provisions set forth in this chapter.(b) Upon a showing by a preponderance of evidence that a violation of this chapter has occurred, the Commissioner may impose an administrative penalty of not more than $10,000 for each act of insurance fraud. An act of insurance fraud may be 1 of several such acts which taken together comprise a fraudulent insurance scheme. Assessment of the administrative penalty shall be determined by the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the act or acts of insurance fraud, any prior history of such act or acts, the degree of culpability and such other matters as justice may require.(c) In the event of nonpayment of the administrative penalty after all rights of appeal have been waived or exhausted, a civil action may be brought by the Commissioner in Superior Court for the collection of the administrative penalty, including interest, attorneys’ fees and costs, in the following manner:(1) A praecipe and complaint shall be filed setting forth that administrative action was taken against the defendant in accordance with this chapter, that the defendant either voluntarily entered into a consent order which called for the payment of a specified monetary penalty, or in the alternative, that after proper notice and hearing, the defendant was determined to be in violation of this chapter and that by order of the Commissioner a specified monetary penalty had been assessed against the defendant, that all rights of appeal have been waived or exhausted, and that payment in full has not been made in accordance with the terms of the consent order or other order of the Commissioner. The Department shall attach to the complaint a certified copy of that consent order or other order of the Commissioner.(2) The Court shall enter judgment in favor of the Department for the amount specified in the complaint upon the Department establishing the following:a. The defendant is the same person against whom the consent order or other order of the Commissioner applies; andb. Payment in full has not been made by or on behalf of the defendant according to the terms of the consent or other order of the Commissioner.(3) Any judgment entered shall be final to the same extent as a judgment entered after trial.(4) Except as otherwise provided in this section the Superior Court Civil Rules shall govern these proceedings.(d) Any person who is found to have committed an act of insurance fraud, or violated an order of the Commissioner pursuant to a hearing, shall be liable for costs incurred by the Bureau. The assessment for costs shall be 15% of each penalty assessed pursuant to this section.(e) In addition to the above, the Commissioner shall have authority to order restitution to the insurer, or self-insured employer of any insurance proceeds paid pursuant to a fraudulent claim.(f) The expenses or administrative penalties collected by the Bureau under this chapter are appropriated to the Bureau in accordance with § 2404 of this title. All moneys received by the Commissioner from insurers and agents pursuant to this chapter shall be transmitted to the State Treasurer to be deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of the Delaware Insurance Fraud Auxiliary Fund. All such moneys which are deposited in the Auxiliary Fund shall be appropriated to the Bureau to be used exclusively for the support of the Bureau. However, the Department may, in its discretion, pay a reward drawn from the assessed administrative penalty to an individual who reports to the Insurance Department an incident of insurance fraud which results in either an admission or finding of fraud. The reward shall not exceed the lesser of the assessed administrative penalty or $25,000. In order to be eligible to receive a reward pursuant to this subsection, a reporting individual must sign a written complaint that subjects the person to the sanctions of § 1233 of Title 11. An insurance carrier that is the victim of insurance fraud is not eligible to receive a reward pursuant to this subsection for reporting such fraud.69 Del. Laws, c. 463,\n\n§\n\n 1;71 Del.
