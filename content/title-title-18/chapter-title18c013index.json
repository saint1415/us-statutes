Eligible investments.(a) Insurers shall invest in or lend their funds on the security of, and shall hold as invested assets, only eligible investments as prescribed in this chapter.(b) Any particular investment held by an insurer on November 1, 1968, which was a legal investment at the time it was made, and which the insurer was legally entitled to possess immediately prior to such date, shall be deemed to be an eligible investment.(c) An investment qualified, in whole or in part, for acquisition or holding as an eligible investment may be qualified or requalified at the time of acquisition or at a later date, in whole or in part, under any section of this chapter, if the relevant conditions contained in the section are satisfied at the time of qualification or requalification. In order for an investment, subsequent to the time of its acquisition, to be qualified or requalified, prior written approval of the Commissioner must be obtained.(d) Unless otherwise specified, an investment limitation computed on the basis of an insurer’s admitted assets or capital and surplus shall relate to the amount required to be shown on the statutory balance sheet of the insurer most recently required to be filed with the Commissioner or as shown by a current financial statement resulting from merger of another insurer, bulk reinsurance, or change in capitalization. For purposes of computing any limitation based upon admitted assets, the insurer shall deduct from the amount of its admitted assets the amount of the liability recorded on its statutory balance sheet for:(1) The return of acceptable collateral received in a reverse repurchase transaction or a securities lending transaction;(2) Cash received in a dollar roll transaction; and(3) The amount reported as borrowed money in the most recently filed financial statement, to the extent not included in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.(e) An insurer shall not invest in:(1) Corporate obligations under § 1308 (c)(5) of this title;(2) Bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness secured by second mortgages or deeds of trust under § 1323(a) of this title;(3) Participations under § 1323(e) of this title;(4) Secured obligations of institutions under § 1331 of this title; or(5) Production payments under § 1332 of this title;Unless such insurer possesses unimpaired capital and surplus (contributed and assigned) of not less than $7,500,000 (as shown by the insurer’s annual statement as of December 31 next preceding the date of acquisition), which amount shall be invested in investments permitted under this chapter other than those specified in this subsection or § 1320 (miscellaneous investments) of this title.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1302;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;63 Del. Laws, c. 363,\n\n§\n\n 19;70 Del. Laws, c. 108,\n\n§§\n\n 1, 2;71 Del. Laws, c. 202,\n\n§§\n\n 1, 2;§\n\n1303. General qualifications.(a) No security or investment, other than real and personal property acquired under § 1324 (real estate) of this title, shall be eligible for acquisition, unless it is interest bearing or interest accruing or entitled to dividends or is otherwise income earning, is not then in default in any respect, and the insurer is entitled to receive for its exclusive account and benefit the interest or income accruing thereon. A debt security will be considered to be income earning where, although bearing no fixed or contingent interest, it is issued at a discount and contains a specific maturity date on which redemption is to be made at a stated value. Stocks will be considered income earning although dividends are currently not being paid. Nothing in this section shall prohibit an insurer from giving or receiving a participating interest in a bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness acquired by such insurer under § 1323 of this title, or the acquisition by an insurer of warrants, options or similar rights to acquire securities if:(1) The acquisition of such securities would then be permitted by this chapter (other than § 1320 of this title); or(2) Such warrants, options or similar rights are acquired in connection with an investment otherwise permitted by this chapter.(b) No security or investment shall be eligible for purchase at a price above its fair value or market value.(c) Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the acquisition by an insurer of other or additional securities or property if received as a dividend or as a lawful distribution of assets, or upon a debt or judgment, or under a lawful and bona fide agreement of bulk reinsurance, merger or consolidation, or if acquired by it through the exercise of warrants, options or similar rights to acquire securities received by it in accordance with this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any insurer from entering into an agreement for the purpose of protecting the interests of the insurer in securities lawfully held by it, or for the purpose of reorganization of a corporation which issued securities so held, and from depositing such securities with a committee or depositaries appointed under such agreement, nor from accepting stock, bonds or other securities or other property which may be distributed pursuant to any such agreement, or to any plan of reorganization or arrangement; and no provision of this chapter shall prevent any insurer from acquiring or holding any property acquired in satisfaction of any debt previously contracted, or that shall be obtained by sale or foreclosure of any security held by it. Any security or property so acquired which is not otherwise an eligible investment under this chapter shall be disposed of pursuant to § 1325 of this title if real estate, or pursuant to § 1326 of this title if personal property or securities.(d) Except as provided in § 1305(5) of this title, the limitations of this chapter shall apply to all investments described in § 77r-1 of Title 15 of the United States Code [15 U.S.C. § 77r-1].(e) For purposes of the investment limitations of this chapter, investments made by an insurer shall include investments made by that insurer’s investment subsidiary.18 Del.

Diversification.An insurer shall invest in or hold as admitted assets categories of investments within applicable limits as follows only:(1)One person. —An insurer shall not at any 1 time have any combination of investments in or loans upon the security of obligations, property or securities of any 1 person (other than its lawful subsidiary) aggregating over 10% of the insurer’s assets.

Upon a request in writing the Commissioner may permit an insurer to invest an amount up to 5% in excess of any specific investment limitation if determined by the Commissioner to be a sound and prudent investment. Notwithstanding any other limitations contained herein, no investment in a single person other than an investment deemed eligible under § 1302(b) of this title or as provided in § 1313 of this title, shall exceed 50% of policyholders’ surplus without the written approval of the Commissioner.18 Del.

Corporate obligations.(a) An insurer may invest any of its funds in obligations rated 1 or 2 by the SVO if they are issued, assumed or guaranteed by any solvent institution created or existing under the laws of the United States or Canada or of any state, district, province or territory thereof.(b) An insurer may also invest any of its funds in any medium or lower grade obligations of any institution created or existing under the laws of the United States or Canada or of any state, district, province or territory thereof, provided, however, that:(1) Without prior approval of the Commissioner, no insurer shall invest any of its funds in any medium grade or lower grade obligation of any institution if, after giving effect to any such acquisition, the aggregate amount of all medium grade and lower grade obligations then held by the insurer would exceed 20 percent of its admitted assets.(2) Without the prior approval of the Commissioner, no insurer shall invest any of its funds in any lower grade obligation of any institution if, after giving effect to any such acquisition, the aggregate amount of all lower grade obligations then held by the insurer would exceed 10 percent of its admitted assets; provided, that no more than 3 percent of its admitted assets consists of obligations rated 5 or 6 by the Securities Valuation Office. In addition, without the Commissioner’s prior approval, no insurers shall acquire any obligation rated 6 by the Securities Valuation Office and no more than 1 percent of its admitted assets may consist of obligations rated 6 by the Securities Valuation Office.(3) Attaining the limit of any 1 category referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall not preclude an insurer from investing any of its funds in obligations in other categories subject to the specific and multicategory limits. Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit an insurer from investing any of its funds in any obligation which it has committed to acquire if the insurer would have been permitted to invest any of its funds in that obligation pursuant to this section on that date on which such insurer committed to make such investment. For the purposes of determining limitations contained in this chapter, an insurer shall give appropriate recognition to any commitments to acquire investments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an insurer may invest any of its funds in an obligation of an institution in which such insurer already has 1 or more investments, if such investment is made in order to protect an investment previously made in the obligations of such institution; provided, that such investment shall not exceed1/2of 1 percent of the insurer’s admitted assets.(c) An insurer may also invest any of its funds in obligations other than those permitted in subsection (a) or (b) of this section or those eligible for investment under § 1323 (real estate mortgages) of this title if they are issued, assumed or guaranteed by any solvent institution created or existing under the laws of the United States or Canada or of any state, district, province or territory thereof and are qualified under any of the following:(1) Obligations which are secured by adequate collateral security and bear fixed interest, if during each of any 3, including either of the last 2, fiscal years of a period of not less than 3 nor more than 5 fiscal years next preceding the date of acquisition by such insurer, the net earnings of the issuing, assuming or guaranteeing institution available for its fixed charges, as defined in § 1309 of this title, shall have been not less than 11/4times the total of its fixed charges for such year, or obligations which, at the date of acquisition by such insurer, are adequately secured and have investment qualities and characteristics wherein the speculative elements are not predominant.

Laws, c. 202,\n\n§§\n\n 4-6;§\n\n1309. Corporate obligations; terms defined.(a) Certain terms used are defined for the purposes of this chapter as follows:(1) “Fixed charges” includes interest on funded and unfunded debt, amortization of debt discount and rentals for leased properties, except that interest paid by a bank or trust company upon any deposit shall not be deemed a fixed charge of such institution.(2) “Institution” includes corporations, joint-stock associations, investment partnerships, business joint ventures and business trusts, statutory trusts or similar entities.(3) “Liquid assets” and “liabilities”, as to the most recent fiscal year of an issuing, assuming or guaranteeing institution, shall be determined in reliance upon the latest regular financial statement of such institution prepared as of a date not more than 15 months prior to the date of acquisition of the obligations in question by an insurer and, as to any prior fiscal year of such institution, shall be determined in reliance upon the regular financial statement of such institution as of the close of the applicable fiscal year. If net earnings are determined in reliance upon consolidated earnings statements of parent and subsidiary institutions, “liquid assets” and “liabilities” shall be determined in reliance upon consolidated financial statements of parent and subsidiary institutions after treating any minority stock interest in such subsidiary institutions as a liability.(4) “Liquid assets” means the sum of cash, receivables or portions thereof, as the case may be, payable on demand or not more than 12 years after the date as of which determination thereof shall be made for purposes of § 1308 of this title, and readily marketable securities, in each case less applicable reserves and unearned income.(5) “Lower grade obligations” means obligations rated 4, 5 or 6 by the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.(6) “Medium grade obligations” means obligations rated 3 by the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.(7) “Net earnings available for fixed charges” means net income after deducting operating and maintenance expenses, taxes (other than federal, state and other income taxes), depreciation and depletion, but excluding extraordinary nonrecurring items of income or expense appearing in the regular financial statements of such institutions.(8) “Obligations” includes bonds, debentures, notes and other evidences of indebtedness (whether or not liability for payment extends beyond the security therefor) as well as participation interests in any of the foregoing.(9) “SVO” means the Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC or any successor office established by the NAIC.”(b) If net earnings are determined in reliance upon consolidated earnings statements of parent and subsidiary institutions, such net earnings shall be determined after provision for income taxes of subsidiaries in which the parent institution owns directly or indirectly less than 80% of all classes of voting stock, and after proper allowance for minority stock interest if any; and the required coverage of fixed charges shall be computed on a basis including fixed charges and preferred dividends of subsidiaries other than those payable by such subsidiaries to the parent corporation or to any other of such subsidiaries, except that if the minority common stock interest in the subsidiary corporation is substantial, the fixed charges and preferred dividends may be apportioned in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner.(c) If the issuing, assuming or guaranteeing institution has not been in legal existence for the whole of the period for which earnings tests are being applied for purposes of § 1308, § 1310 or § 1311 of this title, but was formed as a consolidation or merger of 2 or more businesses of which at least 1 was in operation at the commencement of such period or such institution has acquired all or substantially all of the assets of a business or any divisional, branch or other unitary portion thereof which was in operation at the commencement of such period, the tests of eligibility under § 1308, § 1310 or § 1311 of this title, as the case may be, shall be based upon pro forma statements incorporating statements of the predecessor or constituent institutions or businesses or portions thereof.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1309;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;59 Del. Laws, c. 79,\n\n§§\n\n 11-13;63 Del. Laws, c. 363,\n\n§§\n\n 4-7;70 Del. Laws, c. 108,\n\n§\n\n 4;71 Del.

Preferred or guaranteed stocks.An insurer may invest in preferred or guaranteed stocks or shares of any solvent institution existing under the laws of the United States or of Canada, or of any state or province thereof, if all of the prior obligations and prior preferred stocks, if any, of such institution at the date of acquisition of the investment by the insurer are eligible as investments under this chapter and are rated 1 or 2 by the SVO or if the net earnings of such institution available for its fixed charges during either of the last 2 years have been, and during each of the last 5 years have averaged, not less than 11/2times the sum of its average annual fixed charges, if any, its average annual maximum contingent interest, if any, and its average annual preferred dividend requirements. For the purposes of this section such computation shall refer to the fiscal years immediately preceding the date of acquisition of the investment by the insurer, and the term “preferred dividend requirement” shall be deemed to mean cumulative or noncumulative dividends, whether paid or not.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1310;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;71 Del. Laws, c. 202,\n\n§\n\n 8;§\n\n1311. Common stocks; limited partnerships.An insurer may invest in common stocks, other than insurance stocks, of any solvent institution organized and existing under the laws of the United States or Canada, or of any state or province thereof, if during a period of 7 fiscal years next preceding the date of acquisition by such insurer the institution had aggregate net earnings available for the payment of dividends upon its common stock of no less than the aggregate sum which would have been sufficient to pay dividends of 4% per annum upon the par value (or in the case of common stocks without par value, upon the stated capital) of all of its shares of common stock outstanding during such period. As used in this section the term “common stock” includes transferable certificates of participation in business trusts and statutory trusts. An insurer may invest in or otherwise acquire and hold a limited partnership interest in any limited partnership formed pursuant to the laws of any state or the United States of America. No limited partnership interest shall be acquired under this section if the cost thereof would exceed 2% of the assets of such insurer nor if such cost, plus the book value on the date of such acquisition of all limited partnership interest then held by such insurer and acquired under this section, would exceed 10% of such assets.18 Del.

All stocks under this subsection shall be subject to the limitation as to amount as provided in § 1313 of this title. The Commissioner shall not give his or her consent to any such acquisition if the Commissioner finds that it would not be in the best interests of the insurers involved, or of their respective policyholders or stockholders, or that such acquisition would materially tend to lessen competition or to result in any monopoly in the insurance business.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1312;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1313.

Investments in foreign countries.(a) An insurer transacting insurance in a foreign country may invest funds required to meet its obligations in such country and in conformity with the laws thereof in the same kinds of securities and investments of or in such country as the insurer is authorized to invest in or acquire under other provisions of this chapter. Except as provided in the foregoing sentence and in subsection (b) of this section, an insurer may not invest more than 15% of its assets in securities or investments of or in foreign countries other than Canada nor invest more than an aggregate of 5% of its assets in securities or investments of or in a single foreign jurisdiction which has a sovereign debt rating of SVO 1 or 3% of its assets as to any other foreign jurisdiction.

Negotiation and issuance of insurance on risks situated outside every such state, and changes in, communications concerning, and collection of premiums on insurance so issued shall not be deemed hereunder to be doing business in any such state.(c) If such an insurer is not transacting insurance in the United States of America, it may establish 1 or more separate accounts and subaccounts thereto in respect to 1 or more jurisdictions outside the United States relating to insurance business conducted in such jurisdiction outside the United States. The insurer may allocate assets and make deposits thereto in respect of the whole or any part of the insurance business transacted by it in such jurisdiction for the purpose of segregating the insurer’s assets for the benefit of policyholders of that jurisdiction, subject to the following:(1) All amounts received by an insurer in respect of a class of insurance business written in that jurisdiction, after the establishment of a separate account in respect of that class or classes of business, shall be carried to and become assets of the separate account. The assets of each separate account shall be kept separate and distinct from other assets of the insurer.(2) Subaccounts may be established within a separate account for classes of insurance business written in that jurisdiction. All amounts received by the insurer with respect to the class of insurance in a subaccount shall be carried to and become assets of such subaccount.(3) The income, gains and losses, realized or unrealized, from assets allocated to a separate account or subaccount thereof shall be credited to or charged against such separate account or subaccount, without regard to other income, gains or losses of the insurer. To the extent that the value of the assets in such separate account or subaccount are in excess of the reserves, other contract liabilities, solvency and other requirements of the jurisdiction in which the separate account or subaccount is established, such excess may be withdrawn by the insurer.(4) Amounts allocated to a separate account or subaccount thereof in the exercise of the power granted by this subsection shall be owned by the insurer and the insurer shall not be, nor hold itself out to be, a trustee with respect to such amounts.(5) The assets of a separate account or subaccount shall not be available to meet any liabilities of the insurer other than policyholder liabilities, expenses, taxes and levies, directly related to such separate account or subaccounts. The assets of any separate account or subaccount equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to those accounts are excluded from the insurer’s general assets and as such shall not be charged with other liabilities of the insurer which may arise out of any other business which the insurer may conduct other than the separate account or subaccount. In any dissolution or liquidation of an insurer which has established a separate account or subaccount under this subsection, the assets of the account shall be available only for meeting the policyholder liabilities of the company attributable to the business in respect of which such separate account or subaccount was established. Any assets which remain in any such account after the satisfaction of all policyholder liabilities of the account shall be made available to the appointed receiver.(6) An insurer shall not mortgage or charge any of the assets of any separate account or subaccount thereof, except for the benefit of such separate account or subaccount.(7) Assets of a readily determinable market value maintained in the separate account or subaccount shall be freely exchangeable in the discretion of the insurer at any time for assets of like value.(8) Where an insurer wishes to establish a separate account in respect of a part of the insurance business of the insurer, the insurer shall apply to the Commissioner in writing for approval to establish the separate account, and shall indicate the proposed date and the part of the insurance business of the insurer in respect of which the separate account is to be established. The separate account shall take effect upon the approval of the Commissioner.(9) A separate account or subaccount established under this subsection in respect of any part of the insurance business of an insurer shall continue to be maintained in accordance with this subsection for as long as the insurer has any outstanding obligations or liabilities in respect of that part of its business.(10) Negotiation and issuance of insurance on risks situated outside the United States of America, and changes in, and communications concerning, and collection of premiums on insurance so issued shall not be deemed hereunder to be doing business or transacting insurance in the United States of America.18 Del.

or(2) The insurer holds a senior participation giving it substantially the rights of a first or second mortgagee and a position of priority over the other holders of participations in such indebtedness;

Bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness acquired pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the applicable limitations of § 1321 of this title.
