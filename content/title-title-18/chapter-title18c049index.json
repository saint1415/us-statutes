C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4914;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4915. Levy of contingent liability.(a) If at any time the assets of a domestic mutual insurer are less than its liabilities and the minimum amount of surplus required to be maintained by it under this title for authority to transact the kinds of insurance being transacted and the deficiency is not cured from other sources, its directors may, if the same is approved by the Commissioner as being reasonable and in the best interests of the insurer and its members, levy an assessment only on its members who held the policies providing for contingent liability at any time within the 12 months next preceding the date the levy was authorized by the board of directors, and such members shall be liable to the insurer for the amount so assessed.(b) The levy of assessment shall be for such an amount as is required to cure such deficiency and to provide a reasonable amount of working funds above such minimum amount of surplus, but such working funds so provided shall not exceed 5% of the sum of the insurer’s liabilities and such minimum required surplus as of the date of the levy.(c) As to the respective policies subject to the levy, the assessment shall be computed upon the basis of premium earned during the period covered by the levy.(d) No member shall have an offset against any assessment for which such member is liable, on account of any claim for unearned premium or loss payable.(e) As to life insurance, any part of such an assessment upon a member which remains unpaid following notice of assessment, demand for payment, and lapse of a reasonable waiting period as specified in such notice, may, if approved by the Commissioner as being in the best interests of the insurer and its members, be secured by placing a lien upon the cash surrender values and accumulated dividends held or to be held by the insurer to the credit of the member’s policy.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4915;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4916.

Failure of the member to receive the notice so mailed, within the time specified therein for the payment of the assessment or at all, shall be no defense in any action to collect assessment.(b) If a member fails to pay the assessment within the period specified in the notice, which period shall not be less than 20 days after mailing, the insurer may institute suit to collect the same.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4916;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4917. Nonassessable policies, mutual insurers; revocation of authority.(a) A domestic mutual insurer, by depositing through the Commissioner and thereafter maintaining unimpaired surplus funds not less in amount than the minimum paid-in capital stock required of a domestic stock insurer for authority to transact the same kind or kinds of insurance, may, upon receipt of the Commissioner’s order so authorizing, extinguish the contingent liability to assessment of its members as to all its policies in force and, so long as such surplus and deposit are maintained, may omit provisions imposing contingent liability in all policies currently issued. Any deposit of the insurer made through the Commissioner as prerequisite to its certificate of authority may be included as part of the deposit required under this section.(b) The Commissioner shall not authorize a domestic insurer to extinguish the contingent liability of any of its members or in any of its policies to be issued, unless it qualifies to and does extinguish such liability of all its members and in all such policies for all kinds of insurance transacted by it.(c) The Commissioner shall revoke the authority of a domestic mutual insurer to issue policies without contingent liability if:(1) At any time the insurer’s assets are less than the sum of its liabilities and the surplus required for such authority, or(2) The insurer, by resolution of its board of directors approved by a majority of its members, requests that the authority be revoked.(d) During the absence of such authority, the insurer shall not issue any policy without providing therein for the contingent liability of the policyholder, nor renew any policy which is then in force without endorsing the same to provide for such contingent liability.18 Del.
