The Commissioner shall have authority at any time to require the applicant to fully disclose the identity of all stockholders, partners, officers and employees and the Commissioner may refuse to issue or renew a license in the name of any firm, partnership or corporation so long as the Commissioner remains satisfied that any officer, employee, stockholder or partner thereof who may materially influence the applicant’s conduct fails to meet the standards of this chapter.60 Del.

If the Commissioner does not so find, he or she shall, within 30 days after receipt of such application, if so requested by the applicant, give the applicant a full hearing on its application.(b) The Commissioner shall issue or renew a license as may be applied for when the Commissioner is satisfied that the person to be licensed:(1) Is competent and trustworthy and intends to act in good faith in the capacity required by the license applied for;(2) Has a good business reputation and has sufficient experience, training or education to be qualified in the business represented by the license applied for;(3) If a corporation, is a corporation incorporated under the laws of this State or is a foreign corporation authorized to transact business in this State; and(4) Has the necessary financial resources available to enter in the business for which such person is asking to be licensed or as to which such person is requesting renewal of his or her license.60 Del.

The amount of any such administrative penalty shall be paid by such company to the Commissioner within 30 days of the date such a penalty is levied.(c) If the Commissioner refuses to issue or renew any license or if the applicant or licensee is aggrieved by any action of the Commissioner, such applicant or licensee shall have the same right to a hearing and appeal as provided for other aggrieved parties in this title.(d) At any hearing provided for by this chapter the Commissioner shall have all such authority as the Commissioner otherwise has under this title to conduct hearings.60 Del.

Maximum service charge.(a) A premium finance company shall not charge, contract for, receive or collect a service charge other than as permitted by this chapter.(b) The service charge is to be computed on the balance of the premiums due, after subtracting the down payment made by the insured in accordance with the premium finance agreement, from the effective date of the insurance coverage for which the premiums are being advanced to and including the date when the final installment is payable under the premium finance agreement.(c) The maximum service charge permissible shall be $9.00 per $100 per year plus an additional nonrefundable initial charge of $10 per premium finance contract and the said maximum service charge shall include any interest charged on such loans within the limitations thereon stated above. Any service charge, including interest, which exceeds the said permissible maximum rate limitation, shall be considered usurious and any person paying such usurious rate shall be entitled to all the remedies permitted under § 2304 of Title 6 for recovery of funds in an usurious loan.(d) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary within any premium finance agreements, any insured may prepay obligations under any such agreement in full at any time.

The amount of such refund credit shall represent at least as great a proportion of the service charge as the sum of the periodic balances after the month in which prepayment is made bears to the sum of all periodic balances under the schedule of installments in the agreement. Where the amount of the refund credit is less than $1.00, no refund need be made. If in addition to the service charge, an additional, nonrefundable initial charge as permitted in subsection (c) of this section was imposed, such additional charge need not be refunded nor taken into consideration in computing the refund credit.(e) No premium finance company shall induce an insured to become obligated under more than 1 premium finance agreement for the purpose of obtaining more than 1 additional nonrefundable initial charge.60 Del.

Further, if the default results in the cancellation of any insurance contract listed in the agreement, the agreement may provide for the payment by the insured of a cancellation charge equal to the difference between any delinquency charge imposed in respect to the installment in default as permitted hereinabove and the sum of $5.00.60 Del. Laws, c. 406,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4809. Cancellation of insurance contract upon default.(a) When in connection with a premium finance agreement, a power of attorney or other authority to cancel any insurance contract or contracts on behalf of the insured is given to a premium finance company, such insurance contract or contracts may not be cancelled by the premium finance company unless such cancellation is effectuated in accordance with this section; provided, however, that cancellation of automobile casualty insurance contracts pursuant to this section may be made only in a manner which is consistent with Chapter 39 of this title and the method of such cancellation shall be consistent with the time periods and be subject to the rights of reinstatement provided in that chapter for cancellation on the basis of nonpayment of premium.(b) Not less than 10 days’ written notice shall be mailed to the insured at the insured’s last known address of the intent of the premium finance company to cancel the insurance contract unless a default is cured within such 10-day period.(c) After the expiration of such 10-day period, the premium finance company may thereafter cancel in the name of the insured such insurance contract or contracts by mailing to the insurer a notice of cancellation, and the insurance contract shall be cancelled as if notice of cancellation had been submitted by the insured but without requiring the return of the insurance contract or contracts. The premium finance company shall also mail notice of cancellation to the insured at the insured’s last known address.(d) No policy may be cancelled by a premium finance company solely because of nonpayment of a delinquency or collection charge provided for in this chapter.(e) All statutory, regulatory and contractual restrictions providing that the insurance contract may not be cancelled unless notice is given to a government agency, mortgagee or other third party shall apply where cancellation is effected under this section. The insurer, in accordance with the said prescribed notice, any time it is required to give such notice on behalf of itself or the insured, shall give notice to such governmental agency, mortgagee or other person before the end of the second business day after the day it receives the notice of cancellation from the premium finance company and shall determine the effective date of cancellation, taking into consideration the number of days’ notice required to complete the cancellation.(f) Whenever an insurance contract is cancelled in accordance with this section, the insurer shall return whatever gross unearned premiums are due under the contract to the premium finance company effecting the cancellation for the account of the insured or insureds as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event shall the period for such payment exceed 90 days after the effective date of the cancellation.60 Del. Laws, c. 406,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4810.
