      "text": "Special permits authorization for reclamation of existing abandoned coal processing waste piles; coal extraction pursuant to a government-financed reclamation contract; coal extraction as an incidental part of development of land for commercial, residential, industrial or civic use; no cost reclamation contract.(a) Except where exempted by section twenty-six of this article, it is unlawful for any person to engage in surface-mining as defined in this article as an incident to the development of land for commercial, residential, industrial or civic use without having first obtained from the director a permit therefor as provided in section eight of this article, unless a special authorization therefor has been first obtained from the director as provided in this section.Application for a special authorization to engage in surface-mining as an incident to the development of land for commercial, residential, industrial or civic use shall be made in writing on forms prescribed by the director and shall be signed and verified by the applicant. The application shall be accompanied by:(1) A site preparation plan, prepared and certified by or under the supervision of a person approved by the director, showing the tract of land which the applicant proposes to develop for commercial, residential, industrial or civic use; the probable boundaries and areas of the coal deposit to be mined and removed from said tract of land incident to the proposed commercial, residential, industrial or civic use thereof; and such other information as prescribed by the director;(2) A development plan for the proposed commercial, residential, industrial or civic use of said land;(3) The name of owner of the surface of the land to be developed;(4) The name of owner of the coal to be mined incident to the development of the land;(5) A reasonable estimate of the number of acres of coal that would be mined as a result of the proposed development of said land: Provided, That in no event may such number of acres to be mined, excluding roadways, exceed five acres; and(6) Such other information as the director may require to satisfy and assure the director that the surface-mining under special authorization is incidental or secondary to the proposed commercial, residential, industrial or civic use of said land.(b) There shall be attached to the application for the special authorization a certificate of insurance certifying that the applicant has in force a public liability insurance policy issued by an insurance company authorized to do business in this state affording personal injury protection in accordance with subsection (d), section nine of this article.The application for the special authorization shall also be accompanied by a bond, or cash or collateral securities or certificates of the same type, in the form as prescribed by the director and in the minimum amount of $2,000 per acre, for a maximum disturbance of five acres.The bond shall be payable to the State of West Virginia and conditioned that the applicant complete the site preparation for the proposed commercial, residential, industrial or civic use of said land. At the conclusion of the site preparation, in accordance with the site preparation plan submitted with the application, the bond conditions are satisfied and the bond and any cash, securities or certificates furnished with said bond may be released and returned to the applicant. The filing fee for the special authorization is $500. The special authorization is valid for two years.(c) The purpose of this section is to vest jurisdiction in the director, where the surface-mining is incidental or secondary to the preparation of land for commercial, residential, industrial or civic use and where, as an incident to such preparation of land, minerals must be removed, including, but not limited to, the building and construction of railroads, shopping malls, factory and industrial sites, residential and building sites and recreational areas. Anyone who has been issued a special authorization may not be issued an additional special authorization on the same or adjacent tract of land unless satisfactory evidence has been submitted to the director that such authorization is necessary to subsequent development or construction. As long as the operator complies with the purpose and provisions of this section, the other sections of this article are not applicable to the operator holding a special authorization: Provided, That the director shall promulgate rules establishing applicable performance standards for operations permitted under this section.(d) The director may, in the exercise of his or her sound discretion, when not in conflict with the purposes and findings of this article and to bring about a more desirable land use or to protect the public and the environment, issue a reclamation contract solely for the removal of existing abandoned coal processing waste piles: Provided, That a bond and a reclamation plan is required for such operations.(e) No person may engage in coal extraction pursuant to a government-financed reclamation contract without a valid surface-mining permit issued pursuant to this article unless such person affirmatively demonstrates that he is eligible to secure special authorization pursuant to this section to engage in a government-financed reclamation contract authorizing incidental and necessary coal extraction. The director shall determine eligibility before entering into a government-financed reclamation contract authorizing incidental and necessary coal extraction. The director may provide the special authorization as part of the government-financed reclamation contract: Provided, That the contract contains and does not violate the requirements of this section. The director may not be required to grant a special authorization to any eligible person. The director may, however, in his or her discretion, grant a special authorization allowing incidental and necessary coal extraction pursuant to a government-financed reclamation contract in accordance with this section.Only eligible persons may secure special authorization to engage in incidental and necessary coal extraction pursuant to a government-financed reclamation contract. Any eligible person who proposes to engage in coal extraction pursuant to a government-financed reclamation contract may request and secure special authorization from the director to conduct such activities under this section. A special authorization can only be obtained if a clause is inserted in a government-financed reclamation contract authorizing such extraction and the person requesting such authorization has affirmatively demonstrated to the director's satisfaction that he or she has satisfied the provisions of this section. A special authorization shall only be granted by the director prior to the commencement of coal extraction on a project area. In order to be considered for a special authorization by the director, an eligible person must meet the permit eligibility requirements of this article and demonstrate at a minimum that:(1) The primary purpose of the operation to be undertaken is the reclamation of abandoned or forfeited mine lands;(2) The extraction of coal will be incidental and necessary to accomplish the reclamation of abandoned or forfeited mine lands pursuant to a government-financed reclamation contract;(3) Incidental and necessary coal extraction will be confined to the project area being reclaimed; or(4) All coal extraction and reclamation activity undertaken pursuant to a government-financed reclamation project will be accomplished pursuant to the applicable environmental protection performance standards and conditions included in the government-financed reclamation contract.Prior to commencing coal extraction pursuant to a government-financed reclamation project, the contractor shall file with the director a performance bond conditioned upon the contractor's performance of all the requirements of the government-financed reclamation contract pursuant to this article. For a no cost reclamation contract, the criteria for establishing the amount of the performance bond shall be the engineering estimate, determined by the director: Provided, That the director may establish a lesser bond amount for long term, no cost reclamation projects in which the reclamation schedule extends beyond two years. In these contracts, the director may in the alternative establish a bond amount which reflects the cost of the proportionate amount of reclamation which will occur during a specified period. The performance bond which is provided by the contractor under a federally financed or state financed reclamation contract shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this section: Provided, however, That the amount of such bond is equivalent to or greater than the amount determined by the criteria set forth in this subsection.(f) Any person engaging in coal extraction pursuant to this section is subject to the following:(1) Payment of all applicable taxes and fees related to coal extraction;(2) Replacement or restoration of the water supply of an owner of interest in real property who obtains all or part of the owner's supply of water for domestic, agricultural, industrial or other legitimate use from an underground or surface source where such supply has been affected by contamination, diminution or interruption proximately caused by coal extraction;(3) Extraction pursuant to this section cannot be initiated without the consent of the surface owner for right of entry and consent of the mineral owner for extraction of coal.",

The one hundred foot limitation may be waived only when the director, upon consideration of local land uses, finds that the land use of and near the permitted area will be significantly enhanced by an alteration of the topography within the one hundred foot barrier. Mineral removal shall be prohibited within twenty-five feet of all property lines: Provided, however, That the twenty-five foot setback area may, where appropriate, be used for tree planting, berms, visual barriers, vegetation, drainage structures, access rights-of-way or any other purposes approved by the director: Provided further, That existing berms, barriers, stockpiles, roads and other structures in existence within the twenty-five foot setback prior to the effective date of this section may remain in place. The permittee must provide adequate revegetation within the setback, as is appropriate for the intended use.Whenever the director finds that ongoing quarry operations are causing or are likely to cause any of the conditions set forth in the first paragraph of this section, he or she may order immediate cessation of such operations and he or she shall take such other action or make such changes in the permit as he or she may deem necessary to avoid said described conditions.The failure of the director to discharge the mandatory duty imposed by this section is subject to a writ of mandamus, in any court of competent jurisdiction by any private citizen affected thereby.",

The director shall require as a condition of a new permit, groundwater testing prior to and during quarrying. Tests shall be for both quantity and quality of surrounding groundwaters. Groundwater test sites above and below gradient of the proposed quarry shall be established prior to quarrying to establish a six months baseline for area groundwater. Test wells, seeps and springs may be utilized as is appropriate. Monthly testing shall be done prior to the beginning of quarrying, and quarterly monitoring the first year of quarrying. Annual testing is to be done for an additional four years. If no adverse impact to groundwater is discovered, no further monitoring will be required. However, upon subsequent discovery of possible adverse impact, the director may require monthly monitoring and appropriate remedial actions to be done by the permittee.(b) In the case of storm water accumulations or any breakthrough of water, adequate treatment shall be undertaken by the operator so as to prevent pollution occurring from the release of water. Treatment may include check-dams, settling ponds and chemical or physical treatment. In the case of a breakthrough of water, when it is possible, the water released shall be impounded immediately. All water so impounded shall receive adequate treatment by the operator before it is released into the natural drainway.(c) Water leaving the permit area is subject to the requirements of article eleven of this chapter.(d) The permittee shall place a monument as prescribed by the division in an approved location near the operation. If a quarry operation is under a single permit and is not geographically continuous, the permittee shall locate additional monuments and submit additional maps, as required by section five of this article, before mining other permitted areas.(e) The operator shall remove or properly dispose of all metal, equipment and other refuse resulting from the operation. No permittee may engage in or allow, the throwing, dumping, piling or otherwise placing of any overburden, stones, rocks, coal, mineral, earth, soil, dirt, debris, trees, wood, logs or other materials or substances of any kind or nature beyond or outside the area of land which is under permit for which bond has been posted, unless it is placed on a site which has a permit allowing that activity, nor may any operator place any of the foregoing listed materials in a way that normal erosion or slides brought about by natural physical causes will permit the same to go beyond or outside the area of land which is under permit and for which bond has been posted.(f) Prior to beginning quarrying operations, the operator shall install, certify, and maintain a drainage system in accordance with the approved drainage control plan. Lateral drainage ditches connecting to natural or man-made waterways shall be constructed to control water runoff, prevent erosion and provide adequate drainage control. The depth and width of natural drainage ditches and any other diversion ditches may vary depending on the length and degree of slope.(g) When the planting of an area has been completed and full or partial bond release is requested the operator shall file a planting report with the director on a form to be prescribed and furnished by the director providing the following information:(1) Identification of the operation;(2) The types and rate of application of planting or seeding, including mixtures and amounts;(3) Types and rates of fertilizer and any other chemicals used or added to the soil;(4) The date of planting or seeding;(5) The area of land planted; and(6) Other relevant information required by the director.All planting shall be certified by the permittee, or by the party with whom the permittee contracted for planting.(h) All fill and cut slopes of the operation and haulage ways shall be seeded and planted in a manner as prescribed by the quarrying and reclamation plan.(i) After quarrying is completed, the site will be stabilized to prevent erosion. Stabilization may be accomplished by vegetative cover or other means as approved in the quarrying and reclamation plan. Rules proposed pursuant to this article shall contain guidelines for establishing the various types of stabilization.(j) Planting shall be carried out so that it is completed before the end of the first planting season. Vegetative planting may be completed by the operator or the permittee may contract with the local soil conservation district or a private contractor. A revegetation schedule shall be incorporated into the quarrying and reclamation plan.(k) The operator may, where appropriate, use visual screening methods such as berms, plantings, or fences which may be placed within the buffer where conditions allow and where the site is readily visible to the general public.(l) If the permittee or other person desires to conduct underground quarrying upon the premises or use underground quarry surface haulage ways for other lawful purposes, the permittee may designate locations to be used for these purposes where it will not be necessary to backfill if required by the permit, until the underground quarrying or other uses is completed, during which time the bond on file for that portion of that operations may not be released. Locations shall be described on the map required by the provisions of section five of this article.(m) The operator shall also comply with all other permit conditions and requirements of this article and any rules promulgated thereunder.",

Between this sealing plug and a point 20 feet above the next higher oil, gas or water-bearing stratum, the hole shall be filled, in the manner just described; and at such point there shall be placed another plug of cement or other suitable material which will completely seal the hole. In like manner the hole shall be filled and plugged, with reference to each of its oil, gas or water-bearing strata. However, whenever such strata are not widely separated and are free from water, they may be grouped and treated as a single sand, gas or petroleum horizon, and the aforesaid filling and plugging be performed as though there were but one horizon. After the plugging of all oil, gas or water-bearing strata, as aforesaid, a cement plug shall be placed approximately 10 feet below the bottom of the largest casing in the well; from this point to the surface the well shall be filled with mud, clay or other nonporous material, except that a final cement plug shall be installed from a point 100 feet below the surface to the surface. In case any of the oil or gas-bearing strata in a well shall have been shot, thereby creating cavities which cannot readily be filled in the manner above described, the well operator shall follow either of the following methods:(1) Should the stratum which has been shot be the lowest one in the well, there shall be placed, at the nearest suitable point, but not less than 20 feet above the stratum, a plug of cement or other suitable material which will completely seal the hole. In the event, however, that the shooting has been done above one or more oil or gas-bearing strata in the well, plugging in the manner specified shall be done at the nearest suitable point, but not less than 20 feet below and above the stratum shot; or(2) When such cavity shall be in the lowest oil or gas-bearing stratum in the well, a liner shall be placed which shall extend from below the stratum to a suitable point, but not less than 20 feet above the stratum in which shooting has been done. In the event, however, that the shooting has been done above one or more oil or gas-bearing strata in the well, the liner shall be so placed that it will extend not less than 20 feet above, nor less than 20 feet below, the stratum in which shooting has been done. Following the placing of the liner in the manner here specified it shall be compactly filled with cement, mud, clay or other nonporous sealing material.(b) Where the well penetrates one or more workable coal beds and a coal protection string of casing has been circulated and cemented into the surface, the well shall be filled and securely plugged in the manner provided in subdivision (a) of this section, except that expanding cement shall be used instead of regular hydraulic cement, to a point approximately 100 feet below the bottom of the coal protection string of casing. From the point the well shall be plugged according to the provisions in paragraph (1) or (2) below:(1) A 200 foot plug of expanding cement shall be placed in the well. From this point, the well shall be filled with mud, clay or other nonporous material to a point 100 feet below the surface and a plug of cement shall be placed from the point 100 feet below the surface to the surface with a monument installed therein extending 30 inches above ground level.(2) A 100 foot plug of expanding cement shall be placed in the well so that the top of such plug is located at a point just below the coal protection string of casing. After such plug has been securely placed in the well, the coal protection string of casing shall be emptied of liquid from the surface to a point 100 feet below the lowest workable coal bed or to the bottom of the coal protection string of casing, whichever is shallower. A vent or other device approved by the secretary shall then be installed on the top of the coal protection string of casing in such a manner that will prevent liquids and solids from entering the well but will permit ready access to the full internal diameter of the coal protection string of casing when required. The coal protection string of casing and the vent or other device approved by the secretary shall extend, when finally in place, a distance of not less than 30 inches above ground level and shall be permanently marked with the well number assigned by the secretary;(c) Where the well penetrates one or more workable coal beds and a coal protection string of casing has not been circulated and cemented into the surface, the well shall be filled and securely plugged in the manner provided in subsection (a) of this section to a point 50 feet below the lowest workable coal bed. Thereafter, a plug of cement shall be placed in the well at a point not less than 40 feet below the lowest workable coal bed. After the cement plug has been securely placed in the well, the well shall be filled with cement to a point 20 feet above the lowest workable coal bed. From this point the well shall be filled with mud, clay or other nonporous material to a point 40 feet beneath the next overlying workable coal bed, if such there be, and the well shall then be filled with cement from this point to a point 20 feet above such workable coal bed, and similarly, in case there are more overlying workable coal beds. After the filling and plugging of the well to a point above the highest workable coal bed, filling and plugging of the well shall continue in the manner provided in subsection (a) of this section to a point 100 feet below the surface, and a plug of cement shall be installed from the point 100 feet below the surface to the surface with a monument installed therein extending 30 inches above ground level;(d)(1) Where the well penetrates one or more workable coal beds and a coal protection string of casing has not been circulated and cemented into the surface, a coal operator or coal seam owner may request that the well be plugged in the manner provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection rather than by the method provided in subsection (c) of this section. Such request (forms for which shall be provided by the secretary) must be filed in writing with the secretary prior to the scheduled plugging of the well, and must include the number of the well to be plugged and the name and address of the well operator. At the time such request is filed with the secretary, a copy of such request must also be mailed by registered or certified mail to the well operator named in the request.(2) Upon receipt of such request, the secretary shall issue an order staying the plugging of the well and shall promptly determine the cost of plugging the well in the manner provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection and the cost of plugging the well in the manner provided in subsection (c) of this section. In making such determination, the secretary shall take into consideration any agreement previously made between the well operator and the coal operator or coal seam owner making the request. If the secretary determines that the cost of plugging the well in the manner provided in subsection (c) of this section exceeds the cost of plugging the well in the manner provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, the secretary shall grant the request of the coal operator or owner and shall issue an order requiring the well operator to plug the well in the manner provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection. If the secretary determines that the cost of plugging the well in the manner provided in subsection (c) of this section is less than the cost of plugging the well in the manner provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, the secretary shall request payment into escrow of the difference between the determined costs by the coal operator or coal seam owner making the request. Upon receipt of satisfactory notice of such payment, or upon receipt of notice that the well operator has waived such payment, the secretary shall grant the request of the coal operator or coal seam owner and shall issue an order requiring the well operator to plug the well in the manner provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection. If satisfactory notice of payment into escrow, or notice that the well operator has waived such payment, is not received by the secretary within fifteen days after the request for payment into escrow, the secretary shall issue an order permitting the plugging of the well in the manner provided in subsection (c) of this section. Copies of all orders issued by the secretary shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the coal operator or coal seam owner making the request and to the well operator. When the escrow agent has received certification from the secretary of the satisfactory completion of the plugging work and the reimbursable extra cost thereof (that is, the difference between the secretary’s determination of plugging cost in the manner provided in subsection (c) of this section and the well operator’s actual plugging cost in the manner provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection), the escrow agent shall pay the reimbursable sum to the well operator or the well operator’s nominee from the payment into escrow to the extent available. The amount by which the payment into escrow exceeds the reimbursable sum plus the escrow agent’s fee, if any, shall be repaid to the coal owner. If the amount paid to the well operator or the well operator’s nominee is less than the actual reimbursable sum, the escrow agent shall inform the coal owner, who shall pay the deficiency to the well operator or the well operator’s nominee within thirty days. If the coal operator breaches this duty to pay the deficiency, the well operator shall have a right of action and be entitled to recover damages as if for wrongful conversion of personality, and reasonable attorney fees.(3) Where a request of a coal operator or coal seam owner filed pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection has been granted by the secretary, the well shall be plugged in the manner provided in subsection (a) of this section, except that expanding cement shall be used instead of regular hydraulic cement, to a point approximately 200 feet below the lowest workable coal bed. A 100 foot plug of expanding cement shall then be placed in the well beginning at the point approximately 200 feet below the lowest workable coal bed and extending to a point approximately 100 feet below the lowest workable coal bed. A string of casing with an outside diameter no less than four and one-half inches shall then be run into the well to a point approximately 100 feet below the lowest workable coal bed and such string of casing shall be circulated and cemented into the surface:Provided, That if it is a modern well, then a four and one-half inch casing is not required, if the casing is perforated at the required plug intervals, the cement plugs are placed as necessary to seal the well properly, the cement plugs are tagged to ensure adequate fill within the casing, and plugging within the surface casing circulation will be monitored and information documented to ensure adequate fill within the casing. The casing shall then be emptied of liquid from a point approximately 100 feet below the lowest workable coal bed to the surface, and a vent or other device approved by the secretary shall be installed on the top of the string of casing in such a manner that it will prevent liquids and solids from entering the well but will permit ready access to the full internal diameter of the coal protection string of casing when required. The string of casing and the vent or other device approved by the secretary shall extend, when finally in place, a distance of no less than 30 inches above ground level and shall be permanently marked with the well number assigned by the secretary. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subdivision, if under particular circumstances a different method of plugging is required to obtain the approval of another governmental agency for the safe mining through of said well, the secretary may approve such different method of plugging if he or she finds the same to be as safe for mining through and otherwise adequate to prevent gas or other fluid migration from the oil and gas reservoirs as the method above specified.(e) Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, where the well to be plugged is an abandoned well that has no known responsible party and the well operator is also a coal operator that intends to mine through the well, the well shall, at a minimum, be plugged as provided in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection.(1) The well will be cleaned out and prepared for plugging or replugging as follows:(A) If the total depth of the well is less than 4,000 feet, the operator shall completely clean out the well from the surface to at least 200 feet below the base of the lowest workable coal bed, but the secretary may require cleaning to a greater depth due to excessive pressure within the well. If the total depth of the well is 4,000 feet or greater, the operator shall completely clean out the well from the surface to at least 400 feet below the base of the lowest workable coal bed. The operator shall provide to the secretary all information it possesses concerning the geological nature of the strata and the pressure of the well, and shall remove all material from the entire diameter of the well, wall to wall;(B) The operator shall prepare down-hole logs for each well. The logs shall consist of a caliper survey and log(s) suitable for determining the top, bottom, and thickness of all coal seams and potential hydrocarbon-producing strata, as well as the location for a bridge plug. The secretary may approve the use of a down-hole camera survey in lieu of down-hole logs. In addition, the owner shall maintain a journal that describes the depth of each material encountered; the nature of each material encountered; the bit size and type used to drill each portion of the hole; the length and type of each material used to plug the well; the length of casing(s) removed, perforated or ripped, or left in place; any sections where casing was cut or milled; and any other pertinent information concerning cleaning and sealing the well. The operator shall maintain all invoices, work orders, and other records relating to all work on the well as part of the journal and provide to the secretary upon request;(C) When cleaning, the operator shall make a diligent effort to remove all the casing in the well. If it is not possible to remove all the casing, then the operator shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the annulus between the casing and between the casings and the well walls are filled with expanding cement, with a minimum five tenths of one percent expansion upon setting, and contain no voids. If the casing cannot be removed, it must be cut or milled at all workable coal bed levels. Any casing which remains shall be perforated or ripped. If the total depth of the well is less than 4,000 feet, perforations or rips are required every 50 feet from 200 feet below the base of the lowest mineable coal bed up to one hundred feet above the uppermost workable coal bed. If the total depth of the well is 4,000 feet or greater, perforations or rips are required every 50 feet from 400 feet below the base of the lowest workable coal bed up to 100 feet above the uppermost workable coal bed. If the operator, using a casing bond log, demonstrates to the satisfaction of the secretary that all annuli in the well are already adequately sealed with cement, then the operator shall not be required to perforate or rip the casing. When multiple casing and tubing strings are present in the workable coal bed, any casing which remains shall be ripped or perforated and filled with expanding cement in accordance with this paragraph. The operator shall maintain a casing bond log for each casing and tubing string if used in lieu of ripping or perforating multiple strings;(D) If the secretary concludes that the completely cleaned well emits excessive amounts of gas, the operator must place a mechanical bridge plug in the well. If the total depth of the well is less than 4,000 feet, the mechanical bridge plug shall be placed in a competent stratum at least 200 feet below the base of the lowest workable coal bed, but above the top of the uppermost hydrocarbon-producing stratum. If the total depth of the well is 4,000 feet or greater, the mechanical bridge plug shall be placed in a competent stratum at least 400 feet below the base of the lowest mineable coal bed, but above the top of the uppermost hydrocarbon-producing stratum:Provided, That the secretary may require a greater distance to set the mechanical bridge plug, regardless of the total depth of the well, based upon excessive pressure within the well. The operator shall provide the secretary with all information the operator possesses concerning the geologic nature of the strata and pressure of the well. If it is not possible to set a mechanical bridge plug, an appropriately sized packer may be used; and(E) If the upper-most hydrocarbon-producing stratum is within 300 feet of the base of the lowest workable coal bed, the operator shall properly place mechanical bridge plugs as described in paragraph (D) of this subdivision to isolate the hydrocarbon-producing stratum from the expanding cement plug. Nevertheless, if the total depth of the well is less than 4,000 feet, the operator shall place a minimum of 200 feet of expanding cement below the lowest workable coal bed. If the total depth of the well is 4,000 feet or greater, the operator shall place a minimum of 400 feet of expanding cement below the lowest mineable coal bed:Provided, That the secretary may require a greater distance to set the mechanical bridge plug, regardless of the total depth of the well, based upon excessive pressure within the well.(2) After the well is completely cleaned pursuant to subdivision one of this subsection, the operator shall plug or replug the well to the surface as follows:If the total depth of the well is less than 4,000 feet, the operator shall pump expanding cement slurry down the well to form a plug which runs from at least 200 feet below the base of the lowest workable coal bed to the surface. If the total depth of the well is 4,000 feet or greater, the operator shall pump expanding cement slurry down the well to form a plug which runs from at least 400 feet below the base of the lowest workable coal bed to the surface:Provided, That the secretary may, regardless of the total depth of the well, require a lower depth based upon excessive pressure within the well. The expanding cement slurry will be placed in the well under a pressure of at least 200 pounds per square inch. Portland cement shall be used to fill the area from 100 feet above the top of the uppermost workable coal seam to the surface:Provided, That the secretary may require a higher distance based upon excessive pressure within the well;(f) Any person may apply to the secretary for an order to clean out and replug a previously plugged well in a manner which will permit the safe mining through of such well. Such application shall be filed with the secretary and shall contain the well number, a general description of the well location, the name and address of the owner of the surface land upon which the well is located, a copy of or record reference to a deed, lease or other document which entitles the applicant to enter upon the surface land, a description of the methods by which the well was previously plugged, and a description of the method by which such applicant proposes to clean out and replug the well. At the time an application is filed with the secretary, a copy shall be mailed by registered or certified mail to the owner or owners of the land, and the oil and gas lessee of record, if any, of the site upon which the well is located. If no objection to the replugging of the well is filed by any such landowner or oil and gas lessee within 30 days after the filing of the application, and if the secretary determines that the method proposed for replugging the well will permit the safe mining through of such well, the secretary shall grant the application by an order authorizing the replugging of the well. Such order shall specify the method by which the well shall be replugged, and copies thereof shall be mailed by certified or registered mail to the applicant and to the owner or owners of the land, and the oil and gas lessee, if any, of the site upon which such well is located. If any such landowner or oil and gas lessee objects to the replugging of the well, the secretary shall notify the applicant of such objection. Thereafter, the director shall schedule a hearing to consider the objection, which hearing shall be held after notice by registered or certified mail to the objectors and the applicant. After consideration of the evidence presented at the hearing, the secretary shall issue an order authorizing the replugging of the well if the secretary determines that replugging of the well will permit the safe mining through of such well. Such order shall specify the manner in which the well shall be replugged and copies thereof shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the applicant and objectors. The secretary shall issue an order rejecting the application if the secretary determines that the proposed method for replugging the well will not permit the safe mining through of such well;(g) In addition to any other exception set forth in law, an operator will be exempted from the standard requirements for pulling production casing from the well when either of the following circumstances are met:(1) Where intermediate and freshwater casing strings are not cemented to the surface, any uncemented production casing strings must be removed, but the remaining uncemented casing strings may remain in place and be perforated at depths where cement plugs are set according to existing requirements and standards, to allow for cement to enter the casing annulus as plugs are set. No more than two strings of casing will be perforated at once. Additional casing strings will be pulled when needed to prevent perforating more than two casing strings. Cement plugs must be tagged to ensure adequate fill within the casing. Plugging within the surface casing circulation will be monitored and information documented to ensure adequate fill within the casing.(2) Where all freshwater and intermediate casing strings are cemented to the surface and production and conductor casing strings are uncemented to surface, production casing is not required to be pulled from the well. Production casing that is uncemented and left in place must be perforated at depths where cement plugs will be set according to existing requirements and standards as set forth in law, to allow for cement to enter the casing annulus as plugs are set. Cement plugs must be tagged to ensure adequate fill within the casing. Plugging within the surface casing circulation will be monitored and information documented to ensure adequate fill within the casing.(h) All persons adversely affected, by a determination or order of the secretary issued pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be entitled to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of §29A-5-1et seq. and §29A-6-1et seq. of this code.(i) For the purposes of this section, a \"modern well\" means a well where all casing strings, other than the production and conductor strings, are cemented to the surface. Any well that is not defined as a \"modern well\" shall be defined as a \"non-modern well.\"",

Within that six-month period, the operator shall grade or terrace and plant, seed or sod the area disturbed that is not required in production of the horizontal well in accordance with the erosion and sediment control plan.

This partial reclamation satisfies the reclamation requirements of this section:  Provided, That the maximum period in which partial reclamation satisfies the reclamation requirements of this section is five years from completion of the construction of the well pad.  For purposes of this subdivision, construction of a well pad will be deemed to be complete twelve months after construction is commenced if construction of the well pad is not actually completed prior to that date.  Within six months after expiration of the five-year maximum partial reclamation period, the operator shall complete final reclamation of the well pad as set forth in this subsection.(3) Within six months after a horizontal well that has produced oil or gas is plugged or after the plugging of a dry hole, the operator shall remove all production and storage structures, supplies and equipment and any oil, salt water and debris and fill any remaining excavations. Within that six-month period, the operator shall grade or terrace and plant, seed or sod the area disturbed where necessary to bind the soil and prevent substantial erosion and sedimentation.(4) The operator shall reclaim the area of land disturbed in siting, drilling, completing or producing the horizontal well in accordance with the erosion and sediment control plans approved by the secretary or the secretary’s designee pursuant to this article.(b) The secretary, upon written application by an operator showing reasonable cause, may extend the period within which reclamation must be completed, but not to exceed a further six-month period.

These power plants emit approximately one-third of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide;(4) On average, the United States generates approximately fifty-one percent of its electricity from coal-burning power plants, which are a prominent source of carbon dioxide emissions;(5) West Virginia's reliance on electricity produced from coal is even more pronounced, as West Virginia generates approximately ninety-eight percent of its electricity from coal-burning power plants;(6) There is increasing pressure, both nationally and worldwide, to produce electrical power with an ever-decreasing amount of carbon dioxide emissions;(7) West Virginia is a state rich in natural resources, and its economy depends largely upon the demand for energy produced from materials found within the state, not the least of which is coal;(8) As demand for energy produced from alternative and renewable resources rises, new technologies are needed to burn coal more cleanly and efficiently if West Virginia is to remain competitive as an energy producing state;(9) Carbon dioxide capture and sequestration is the capture and secure storage of carbon dioxide that would otherwise be emitted to, or remain in, the atmosphere. This technology is currently being used and tested to reduce the carbon footprint of electricity generated by the combustion of coal;(10) The science of carbon dioxide capture and sequestration is advancing rapidly, but the environmental effects of large, long-term carbon dioxide sequestration operations are still being studied and evaluated;(11) Although the state is committed to expanding its portfolio of alternative and renewable energy resources, electricity generated from these resources is insufficient in the near term to meet the rising demand for energy;(12) It is in the public interest to advance the implementation of carbon dioxide capture and sequestration technologies into the state's energy portfolio;(13) The transportation by pipeline and sequestration of carbon dioxide by a public utility engaged in the generation of electricity may be integral to the construction, maintenance and operation of electric light, heat and power plants operating in the state; and(14) Therefore, in order to expand more rapidly the generation of electricity with little or no carbon dioxide emissions, it is critical to encourage the development of carbon dioxide capture and sequestration technologies; to examine factors that may be integral to the construction, maintenance and operation of carbon dioxide sequestration facilities; and to study the economic and environmental feasibility of large, long-term carbon dioxide sequestration operations.(b) It is therefore the purpose of this article to:(1) Establish a legal and regulatory framework for the permitting of carbon dioxide sequestration operations;(2) Designate a state agency responsible for establishing standards and rules for the permitting of carbon dioxide sequestration operations including, but not limited to, rules pertaining to:(A) Environmental surveillance of carbon dioxide sequestration operations;(B) The monitoring of geologic migration of carbon dioxide and the detection of carbon dioxide excursions;(C) Construction standards for carbon dioxide sequestration operations;(D) Bonding or other financial assurances; and(E) The closure of carbon dioxide sequestration operations, including post-closure monitoring, verification and maintenance; and to(3) With the aid of a carbon dioxide sequestration working group, develop a long-term strategy for the regulation of carbon dioxide sequestration.",

Clinton pledged on October 22, 1997, that \"The United States will not assume binding obligations unless key developing nations meaningfully participate in this effort\";(f) On July 25, 1997, the United States Senate adopted Senate Resolution Number Ninety-eight by a vote of ninety-five to zero, expressing the sentiment of the Senate that \"the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol to other agreement regarding, the Framework Convention on Climate Change... which would require the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, and which would mandate new commitments to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions for the Developed Country Parties, unless the protocol or other agreement also mandates specific scheduled commitments within the same compliance period to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions for Developing Country Parties\";(g) The Kyoto Protocol fails to meet the tests established for acceptance of new climate change commitments by President Clinton and by United States Senate Resolution Number ninety-eight;(h) Achieving the emission reductions proposed by the Kyoto Protocol would require more than a thirty-five percent reduction in projected United States carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions during the period between 2008 to 2012;(i) Developing countries exempt from emission limitations under the Kyoto Protocol are expected to increase their rates of fossil fuel use over the next two decades, and to surpass the United States and other industrialized countries in total emissions of greenhouse gases;(j) Increased emissions of greenhouse gases by developing countries would offset any potential environmental benefits associated with emissions reductions achieved by the United States and by other industrial nations;(k) Economic impact studies by the United States government estimate that legally binding requirements for the reduction of United States greenhouse gases to 1990, emission levels would result in the loss of more than nine hundred thousand jobs in the United States, sharply increased energy prices, reduced family incomes and wages, and severe losses of output in energy-intensive industries important to the West Virginia economy such as aluminum, steel, rubber, chemicals and utilities;(l) The failure to provide for commitments by developing countries in the Kyoto Protocol creates an unfair competitive imbalance between industrial and developing nations, potentially leading to the transfer of jobs and industrial development from the United States to developing countries;(m) Federal implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, if ratified by the United States Senate, would entail new congressional legislation whose form and requirements cannot be predicted at this time, but could include national energy taxes or emission control allocation schemes that would preempt state-specific programs intended to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases;(n) Piecemeal or other uncoordinated state regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases may be inconsistent with subsequent congressional determinations concerning the Kyoto Protocol, and with federal legislation implementing the Kyoto Protocol;(o) Individual state responses to the Kyoto Protocol, including development of new regulatory programs intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, are premature prior to Senate ratification of that Protocol, in its current or amended form, and congressional enactment of related implementing legislation.",

Coal continues to sustain our economy and provides the financial security as future diversity and expansion of our job base is explored;(5) The state of West Virginia, through the Division of Environmental Protection, entered into an agreement on December 23, 1998, which imposed additional controls and oversight on the states' mine permitting process by the U.S. corps of engineers, U.S. environmental protection agency, U.S. office of surface mining and the U.S. fish and wildlife service;(6) The agreement of December 23, 1998 further authorized the Division of Environmental Protection, in conjunction with the U.S. environmental protection agency, the U.S. fish and wildlife service, the U.S. army corps of engineers and the U.S. office of surface mining to undertake a two-year study of the effects of mountaintop mining practices which remains incomplete as of the effective date of this article;(7) The state has committed significant funding and other resources to the study;(8) The study is unprecedented in this country in its purpose and scope;(9) The environmental impact statement which will be prepared upon the completion of the study may give rise to consideration of new or revised regulations, policies, guidelines or requirements which are untried or untested anywhere in this country;(10) It is imperative that balance be sought between state rules designed to regulate and protect the environment and the state regulations designed to enhance the ability of the state to continue to market West Virginia coal throughout the nation and the world; and(11) Requiring West Virginia, through new or amended policies, regulations, enforcement or permitting actions to meet requirements more stringent than those otherwise applicable in other states by the federal government and unnecessary for environmental protection would unfairly affect interstate competition for new mining development and employment opportunities.Wherefore the Legislature finds that prior to the implementation of any recommendation arising from the study that the Legislature has an obligation to review the same to protect the interests of the state and the citizens.",

In order to qualify as secondary containment, the barrier and containment field must be sufficiently impervious to contain fluids in the event of a release, and may include double-walled tanks, dikes, containment curbs, pits, or drainage trench enclosures that safely confine the release from a tank in a facility catchment basin or holding pond. Earthen dikes and similar containment structures must be designed and constructed to contain, for a minimum of 72 hours, fluid that escapes from a tank.(18) \"Secretary\" means the Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection, or his or her designee.(19) \"Source water protection area\" for a public groundwater supply source is the area within an aquifer that supplies water to a public water supply well within a five-year time of travel and is determined by the mathematical calculation of the locations from which a drop of water placed at the edge of the protection area would theoretically take five years to reach the well.(20) \"Zone of critical concern\" for a public surface water supply source and for a public surface water influenced groundwater supply source is a corridor along streams within a watershed that warrants detailed scrutiny due to its proximity to the surface water intake and the intake’s susceptibility to potential contaminants within that corridor. The zone of critical concern is determined using a mathematical model that accounts for stream flows, gradient and area topography. The length of the zone of critical concern is based on a five-hour time of travel of water in the streams to the intake. The width of the zone of critical concern is 1,000 feet measured horizontally from each bank of the principal stream and 500 feet measured horizontally from each bank of the tributaries draining into the principal stream.(21) \"Zone of peripheral concern\" for a public surface water supply source and for a public surface water influenced groundwater supply source is a corridor along streams within a watershed that warrants scrutiny due to its proximity to the surface water intake and the intake’s susceptibility to potential contaminants within that corridor. The zone of peripheral concern is determined using a mathematical model that accounts for stream flows, gradient, and area topography. The length of the zone of peripheral concern is based on an additional five-hour time of travel of water in the streams beyond the perimeter of the zone of critical concern, which creates a protection zone of 10 hours above the water intake. The width of the zone of peripheral concern is 1,000 feet measured horizontally from each bank of the principal stream and 500 feet measured horizontally from each bank of the tributaries draining into the principal stream.",
