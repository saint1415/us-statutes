Laws, c. 172, § 6].(a) When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, retaining, selling and managing property for the benefit of another, a fiduciary shall act with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use to attain the purposes of the account. In making investment decisions, a fiduciary may consider the general economic conditions, the anticipated tax consequences of the investment and the anticipated duration of the account and the needs of the beneficiaries; when considering the needs of the beneficiaries, the fiduciary may take into account the financial needs of the beneficiaries as well as the beneficiaries' personal values, including the beneficiaries' desire to engage in sustainable investing strategies that align with the beneficiaries' social, environmental, governance or other values or beliefs of the beneficiaries.(b) Within the limitations of the foregoing standard and considering individual investments as part of an overall investment strategy, a fiduciary is authorized to acquire every kind of property, real, personal or mixed, and every kind of investment, wherever located, whether within or without the United States, including, but not by way of limitation, bonds, debentures and other corporate obligations, stocks, preferred or common, shares or interests in common funds or common trust funds, securities of any open-end or closed-end management type investment company or investment trust registered under the Federal Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq.), options, futures, warrants, limited partnership interests and life insurance. No investment made by a fiduciary shall be deemed imprudent solely because the investment is not specifically mentioned in this subsection.(c) The propriety of an investment decision is to be determined by what the fiduciary knew or should have known at the time of the decision about:(1) The inherent nature and expected performance of the investment portfolio;(2) The limitations of the standard set forth in subsection (a) of this section; and(3) The nature and extent of other investments and resources, whether held in trust or otherwise, available to the beneficiaries as they existed at the time of the decision; provided however, that the fiduciary shall have no duty to inquire as to the nature and extent of any such other investments and resources not held by the fiduciary, held by the fiduciary in a trust or trust account subject to the direction of an adviser or cotrustee authorized to direct the fiduciary with respect to investment decisions, within the meaning of § 3313(d) of this title, concerning the assets held in the trust or trust account, or held by the fiduciary in a trust or trust account where a cotrustee has exclusive authority with respect to investment decisions, within the meaning of § 3313(d) of this title, concerning the assets held in the trust or trust account.Any determination of liability for investment performance shall consider the performance of the entire portfolio and such other factors as the fiduciary considered when the investment decision was made.(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, a trustee who discloses the application of this subsection and the limitation of the trustee’s duties thereunder either in the governing instrument or in a separate writing delivered to each insured at the inception of a contract of life insurance or thereafter if prior to an event giving rise to a claim thereunder, may acquire or retain a contract of life insurance upon the life of the trustor or the trustor’s spouse, or both, without liability for a loss arising from the trustee’s failure to:(1) Determine whether the contract is or remains a proper investment;(2) Investigate the financial strength or changes in the financial strength of the life insurance company;(3) Make a determination of whether to exercise any policy option available under the contract;(4) Make a determination of whether to diversify such contracts relative to 1 another or to other assets, if any, administered by the trustee; or(5) Inquire about changes in the health or financial condition of the insured or insureds relative to any such contract.(e) Any fiduciary acting under a governing instrument shall not be liable to anyone whose interests arise from that instrument for breach of fiduciary duty for the fiduciary’s good faith reliance on the express provisions of such instrument. The standards set forth in this section may be expanded, restricted or eliminated by express provisions in a governing instrument.(f) Where a bank or trust company acting in a fiduciary capacity invests trust funds in, or otherwise acquires an interest in, a common trust fund which it or 1 of its affiliates manages, as defined in § 23A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. § 371c), the plan for such common trust fund shall be filed and recorded in the office of the Register in Chancery of the county in which is located the main office in Delaware of the bank or trust company which is the fiduciary for such trust funds.(g) Fees may be charged for making an investment through a computerized or automated process, such as sweeping otherwise uninvested cash into a cash management vehicle, provided that the amount of such fees is disclosed on a continuing basis as a separate item on the regular periodic statements furnished to the beneficiaries of the account.(h) A fiduciary is authorized, in the absence of an express provision to the contrary, whenever a law, regulation, governing instrument or order directs, requires, authorizes or permits investment in United States government obligations, to invest in those obligations, either directly or in the form of securities of, or other interests in, any open-end or closed-end management investment company or investment trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (54 Stat. 847, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq.), if the portfolio of that investment company or investment trust is limited to United States government obligations and to repurchase agreements fully collateralized by United States government obligations, which collateral shall be delivered to or held by the investment company or investment trust, either directly or through an authorized custodian.(i) Except in the case of United States government obligations, which are treated in subsection (h) of this section above, the authority to invest in specified types of investments includes authorization to invest in any open-end or closed-end management investment company or investment trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (54 Stat. 847, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq.), or in any common or collective trust fund established and maintained by a corporate fiduciary, if the portfolio of the investment company or investment trust, or of the common or collective trust fund, consists substantially of the specified types of investments and is otherwise in conformity with the laws of the State.25 Del. Laws, c. 226,\n\n§\n\n 3; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3875;37 Del. Laws, c. 259,\n\n§\n\n 1;40 Del. Laws, c. 230,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 4401;44 Del. Laws, c. 171,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\n12 Del.

Laws, c. 172,\n\n§\n\n 2;81 Del. Laws, c. 320,\n\n§\n\n4;§\n\n3303. Effect of provisions of instrument [For application of this section, see 79 Del. Laws, c. 172, § 6].(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code or other law, the terms of a governing instrument may expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise vary any laws of general application to fiduciaries, trusts, and trust administration, including, but not limited to, any such laws pertaining to:(1) The rights and interests of beneficiaries, including, but not limited to, the right to be informed of the beneficiary’s interest for a period of time, as set forth in subsection (c) of this section;(2) The grounds for removal of a fiduciary;(3) The circumstances, if any, in which the fiduciary must diversify investments;(4) The manner in which a fiduciary should invest assets, including whether to engage in 1 or more sustainable or socially responsible investment strategies, in addition to, or in place of, other investment strategies, with or without regard to investment performance;(5) A fiduciary’s powers, duties, standard of care, rights of indemnification and liability to persons whose interests arise from that instrument; and(6) The terms of a power of appointment over trust property;provided, however, that nothing contained in this section shall be construed to permit the exculpation or indemnification of a fiduciary for the fiduciary’s own wilful misconduct or preclude a court of competent jurisdiction from removing a fiduciary on account of the fiduciary’s wilful misconduct. The rule that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed shall have no application to this section. It is the policy of this section to give maximum effect to the principle of freedom of disposition and to the enforceability of governing instruments.(b) In furtherance of and not in limitation of the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the terms of a governing instrument of a trust established and existing for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes or for noncharitable purposes shall not be modified by the court to change the trust’s purposes unless the purposes of the trust have become unlawful under the Constitution of this State or the United States or the trust would otherwise no longer serve any religious, charitable, scientific, literary, educational, or noncharitable purpose, in which case the court shall proceed in the manner directed by § 3541 of this title. A settlor may maintain an action to enforce a charitable or noncharitable trust under this section and may designate a person or persons, whether or not born at the time of such designation, to enforce a charitable or noncharitable trust under this section. For purposes of this subsection, a “noncharitable purpose” is a purpose within the meaning of § 3555 or § 3556 of this title.(c) The terms of a governing instrument may expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise vary the right of a beneficiary to be informed of the beneficiary’s interest in a trust for a period of time, including but not limited to:(1) A period of time related to the age of a beneficiary;(2) A period of time related to the lifetime of each trustor and/or spouse of a trustor;(3) A period of time related to a term of years or specific date; and/or(4) A period of time related to a specific event that is certain to occur.(d) During any period of time that a governing instrument restricts or eliminates the right of a beneficiary to be informed of the beneficiary’s interest in a trust, unless otherwise provided in the governing instrument, any designated representative (as defined in § 3339 of this title) then serving shall represent and bind such beneficiary for purposes of any judicial proceeding and for purposes of any nonjudicial matter, and shall have the authority to, and is a proper party to, initiate a proceeding relating to the trust before a court or administrative tribunal on behalf of any such beneficiary.(e) For purposes of this section, “judicial proceeding” means any proceeding before a court or administrative tribunal, including but not limited to, a proceeding that involves a trust whether or not the administration of the trust is governed by the laws of this State, and “nonjudicial matter” includes, but is not limited to, the grant of consents, releases or ratifications pursuant to § 3588 of this title and the receipt of a report for purposes of measuring the limitation period described in § 3585 of this title.25 Del. Laws, c. 226,\n\n§\n\n 3; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3875;37 Del. Laws, c. 259,\n\n§\n\n 1;40 Del. Laws, c. 230,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 4401;44 Del. Laws, c. 171,\n\n§\n\n 1;47 Del.

Laws, c. 320,\n\n§\n\n4;82 Del. Laws, c. 52,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n3304. Retention by fiduciary of decedent’s or settlor’s investments.Unless expressly provided otherwise in any instrument specified in § 3303 of this title, any provisions in any such instrument prescribing, defining or limiting the kind of property in which the funds of the trust to which such instrument relates shall be invested shall not apply to any property owned by a testator at the time of the testator’s death and delivered to the fiduciary by the personal representative of such testator who has created a trust by the testator’s will or delivered by the settlor to the fiduciary of a trust created in a trust agreement or delivered to the fiduciary pursuant to a court order or other instrument creating or defining the fiduciary’s duties and powers and such fiduciary may retain all such property so acquired, subject to the limitations of the standards set forth in § 3302 of this title. Furthermore, a provision in any such instrument directing the retention of any such property as a trust investment shall be deemed to waive any duty of diversification otherwise applicable to the fiduciary with respect to such property and shall exonerate the fiduciary from liability for retaining the property except in the case of wilful misconduct proven by clear and convincing evidence in the Court of Chancery.25 Del. Laws, c. 226,\n\n§\n\n 3; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3875;37 Del. Laws, c. 259,\n\n§\n\n 1;40 Del. Laws, c. 230,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 4401;44 Del. Laws, c. 171,\n\n§\n\n 1;48 Del. Laws, c. 41,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\n12 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 3304; \n\n70 Del Laws, c. 186,,\n\n§\n\n 1;77 Del. Laws, c. 330,\n\n§\n\n 3;§\n\n3305. Retention by bank or trust company acting as a fiduciary of its own stock.Unless expressly provided otherwise in any instrument specified in § 3303 of this title, a bank or trust company acting as a fiduciary and authorized so to act may retain in a trust estate shares of its own capital stock acquired in any manner referred to in § 3304 of this title, as effectively as though the instrument creating or defining the fiduciary’s duties and powers expressly so provided, subject to the limitations of the standards set forth in § 3302 of this title.25 Del. Laws, c. 226,\n\n§\n\n 3; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3875;37 Del. Laws, c. 259,\n\n§\n\n 1;40 Del. Laws, c. 230,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 4401;44 Del. Laws, c. 171,\n\n§\n\n 1;47 Del. Laws, c. 19,\n\n§\n\n 1;48 Del. Laws, c. 41,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\n12 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 3305;§\n\n3306. Deviation from terms of instrument.Subject to the provisions of § 3303 of this title, nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as restricting the power of a court of proper jurisdiction to permit fiduciaries to deviate from the terms of any will, agreement or other instrument relating to the acquisition, investment, reinvestment, exchange, retention, sale or management of fiduciary property.25 Del. Laws, c. 226,\n\n§\n\n 3; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3875;37 Del. Laws, c. 259,\n\n§\n\n 1;40 Del. Laws, c. 230,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 4401;44 Del. Laws, c. 171,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\n12 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 3306;76 Del. Laws, c. 254,\n\n§\n\n 4;§\n\n3307. Common fund investments by bank or trust company; regulations.(a) A bank or trust company authorized to act in a fiduciary capacity or in the capacity of agent with investment discretion, and acting in such capacity, may invest funds held by it for investment in fractional undivided interests in a common fund composed exclusively of property permitted for investment by the terms of § 3302 of this title and of cash, if such common fund shall have been created and is managed by any bank or trust company authorized to act in a fiduciary capacity, as trustee under a written plan, an original copy of which, executed by such bank or trust company, has been filed and is recorded in the Office of the Register in Chancery of the county in which the main office of such bank or trust company is located. Under such plan it shall not be permitted that any such fractional interests shall at any time be owned by other than a bank or trust company as fiduciary under will, under agreement or for a person with a mental condition or as guardian of a minor or of the property of a person who is elderly or impaired or a person with a mental condition or physical disability or as executor or administrator or as custodian pursuant to Chapter 45 of this title or as agent with investment discretion.(b) At least once each 3 months, as of a predetermined date, a bank or trust company administering a common fund shall determine the fair value of the assets in the common fund. No fractional interest in the common fund shall be acquired or redeemed except on the basis of such valuation and as of such valuation date. A fractional interest in such common fund may only be acquired by payment:(1) In cash; or(2) In property other than cash, provided that such property other than cash is a permissible investment under the terms of § 3302 of this title and under the terms of the plan of a common fund.If a fractional interest is acquired with property other than cash, such property shall be valued for the purposes of the acquisition in the same manner as assets are valued when held in the common fund and the purchaser shall bear all costs of the transfer to the common fund of title to such property. A fractional interest in such common fund may be redeemed by payment of an amount in cash, or ratably in kind, or partly in cash and partly in kind, equal to its proportionate part of the fair value of the common fund.A reasonable period following each such predetermined date may be used to make the computations necessary to determine the value of the common fund and of the participations therein.(c) Unless a bank or trust company making an investment for an account in a common fund shall find that the investments of the common fund as a whole are ones in which the funds of such account might not properly be invested at the time, the investment in such common fund shall not be improper.(d) The bank or trust company may charge a fee or commission to the common fund for its management and receive fees or commissions from participating accounts which may be invested in a common fund in addition to those it would be entitled to receive if such accounts were otherwise invested.25 Del. Laws, c. 226,\n\n§\n\n 3; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3875;37 Del. Laws, c. 259,\n\n§\n\n 1;40 Del. Laws, c. 230,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 4401;43 Del. Laws, c. 224,\n\n§\n\n 1;44 Del.

Laws, c. 179,\n\n§§\n\n 78, 79;§\n\n3308. Power of bank or trust company acting as a fiduciary to purchase property held by its commercial or banking department.(a) A bank or trust company shall not purchase, with funds held by it as a fiduciary, any property held by its commercial or banking department, but this prohibition shall not apply to mortgages and their accompanying bonds designated by its commercial or banking department for future trust investment at the time of acquisition by the commercial or banking department and purchased within 1 year from such time of acquisition with funds held by it in its trust department; provided the interest and taxes are current at the time of purchase by the trust department and an appraisal certificate on the real estate covered by the mortgages being purchased from at least 1 person competent and qualified to appraise real estate is obtained by the trust department at any time within 10 days prior to the purchase by and transfer to the trust department. This exception shall apply to all types of mortgages held by the commercial or banking department, including mortgages covering properties constructed during the 1-year period from the time the mortgages were acquired by the commercial or banking department; provided, with respect to the latter type of mortgages, that an appraisal certificate on the completed property from at least 1 person competent and qualified to appraise such property and a certificate from the owner of the property and/or the registered architect who planned the construction of the property certifying that the construction is complete and satisfactory in every respect, are obtained by the trust department at any time within 10 days prior to the purchase by and transfer to said department.(b) The commercial or banking department shall make a report monthly to the board of directors of the bank or trust company listing all mortgages designated for trust investment and covering all transactions relating thereto and such report shall be noted in the minutes of the meeting of the board.(c) The purchase of mortgages and their accompanying bonds permitted by this section shall be made subject to the limitations of the standard set forth in § 3302 of this title.25 Del.

Laws, c. 271,\n\n§\n\n 4;§\n\n3310. Storage of securities.(a) Except as otherwise provided by the terms of the governing instrument, all securities in a fiduciary estate, whether held by the fiduciary or an agent for the fiduciary, shall be stored separately from any other securities, except as provided hereafter in this section or in § 3311 of this title.(b) A bank or trust company may store together securities of the same class of the same issuer held by it as fiduciary or as agent for a fiduciary or nonfiduciary (but not its own securities) and may combine the securities so stored together into 1 or more securities of the same class of the same issuer, provided the records maintained with respect to those securities disclose the capacity in which they are held and provided there is no written objection from either a cofiduciary or the person for whom it is acting as agent.59 Del. Laws, c. 271,\n\n§\n\n 5;§\n\n3311. Deposit of securities in clearing corporation.(a) Except as otherwise provided by the terms of the governing instrument, a bank or trust company may deposit or arrange for the deposit of in a clearing corporation securities held by it as fiduciary or as agent for a fiduciary or nonfiduciary, provided the records maintained with respect to those securities by such bank or trust company disclose the capacity in which they are held and provided there is no written objection from either a cofiduciary or the person for whom it is acting as agent.(b) Securities deposited in a clearing corporation may be registered in the name of either the clearing corporation or its nominee without disclosing the capacity in which they are held.(c) Securities deposited in a clearing corporation may be stored together with other securities of the same class of the same issuer also stored in the clearing corporation (but not the securities of the clearing corporation) and may be combined with such other securities into 1 or more securities of the same class of the same issuer.59 Del. Laws, c. 271,\n\n§\n\n 6;61 Del. Laws, c. 489,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n3312. Investments in affiliated investments; transactions with affiliates [For application of this section, see 80 Del. Laws, c. 153, § 5].(a) As used in this section:(1) “Affiliate” means any corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly through 1 or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the fiduciary.(2) “Affiliated investment” means an investment for which the fiduciary or an affiliate of the fiduciary acts as adviser, administrator, distributor, placement agent, underwriter, broker or in any other capacity for which it receives or has received a fee or commission from such investment or an investment acquired or disposed of in a transaction for which the fiduciary or an affiliate of the fiduciary receives or has received a fee or commission.(3) “Fee or commission” means compensation paid to a fiduciary or an affiliate thereof on account of its services to or on behalf of an investment.(4) “Fiduciary” means any person, including a bank or trust company, acting as a fiduciary as defined in § 3301 of this title, and includes an agent with investment discretion, whether or not such investment discretion has been delegated to such agent by another fiduciary or fiduciaries or granted directly to such agent.(5) “Governing instrument” means any governing instrument as defined in § 3301 of this title, and includes any agreement or instrument granting fiduciary investment discretion.(6) “Investment” shall mean any security as defined in § 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1)], any contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery within the meaning of § 2(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act [7 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.], or any other asset permitted for fiduciary accounts pursuant to the terms of § 3302 of this title or by the terms of the governing instrument, including by way of illustration and not limitation, shares or interests in a private investment fund (including a private investment fund organized as a limited partnership, limited liability company, a statutory or common law business trust, or a real estate investment trust), joint venture or other general or limited partnership, or an open-end or closed-end management type investment company or investment trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.(b) Subject to the investment standards stated in § 3302 of this title, a fiduciary may purchase, sell, hold or otherwise deal with an affiliate or an interest in an affiliated investment and, upon satisfaction of the conditions stated in subsection (c) of this section, such fiduciary may receive fiduciary compensation from such account at the same rate as the fiduciary would otherwise be entitled to be compensated.(c) A fiduciary seeking compensation pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall disclose to each principal in an agency relationship, and to all current recipients of account statements of any other fiduciary account, all fees or commissions paid or to be paid by the account, or received or to be received by an affiliate arising from such affiliated investment or such other dealing with an affiliate. The disclosure required under this subsection may be given either in a copy of the prospectus or any other disclosure document prepared for the affiliated investment under federal or state securities laws or in a written summary that includes all fees or commissions received or to be received by the fiduciary or any affiliate of the fiduciary and an explanation of the manner in which such fees or commissions are calculated (either as a percentage of the assets invested or by some other method). Such disclosure shall be made at least annually unless there has been no increase in the rate at which such fees or commissions are calculated since the most recent disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, no such disclosure is required if:(1) The governing instrument or a court order expressly authorizes the fiduciary to invest the fiduciary account in affiliated investments or otherwise deal with an affiliate or an interest in an affiliated investment; or(2) The fiduciary invests in an affiliated investment or otherwise deals with an affiliate or an interest in an affiliated investment at the direction of an adviser (who expressly directs the fiduciary to enter into a transaction that would otherwise require disclosure under this subsection and who is not an affiliate) pursuant to subsection (b) of § 3313 of this title.(d) A fiduciary that has complied with subsection (c) of this section (whether by making the applicable disclosure or by relying on the terms of a governing instrument or court order) shall have full authority to administer an affiliated investment (including the authority to vote proxies thereon) without regard to the affiliation between the fiduciary and the investment.65 Del.

Laws, c. 153, § 5].(a) Where 1 or more persons are given authority by the terms of a governing instrument to direct, consent to or disapprove a fiduciary’s actual or proposed investment decisions, distribution decisions or other decision of the fiduciary, such persons shall be considered to be advisers and fiduciaries when exercising such authority provided, however, that the governing instrument may provide that any such adviser (including a protector) shall act in a nonfiduciary capacity.(b) If a governing instrument provides that a fiduciary is to follow the direction of an adviser or is not to take specified actions except at the direction of an adviser, and the fiduciary acts in accordance with such a direction, then except in cases of wilful misconduct on the part of the fiduciary so directed, the fiduciary shall not be liable for any loss resulting directly or indirectly from any such act.(c) If a governing instrument provides that a fiduciary is to make decisions with the consent of an adviser, then except in cases of wilful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the fiduciary, the fiduciary shall not be liable for any loss resulting directly or indirectly from any act taken or omitted as a result of such adviser’s objection to such act or failure to provide such consent after having been requested to do so by the fiduciary.(d) For purposes of this section, unless the terms of the governing instrument provide otherwise, “investment decision” means with respect to all of the trust’s investments (or, if applicable, to investments specified in the governing instrument), the retention, purchase, sale, exchange, tender or other transaction or decision affecting the ownership thereof or rights therein (including the powers to borrow and lend for investment purposes, provided, however, that the power to lend for investment purposes shall be considered an investment decision only with respect to loans other than those described in § 3325(19)b. and c. of this title), all management, control and voting powers related directly or indirectly to such investments (including, without limitation, nonpublicly traded investments), the selection of custodians or subcustodians other than the trustee, the selection and compensation of, and delegation to, investments advisers, managers or other investment providers, and with respect to nonpublicly traded investments, the valuation thereof, and an adviser with authority with respect to such decisions is an investment adviser.(e) Whenever a governing instrument provides that a fiduciary is to follow the direction of an adviser with respect to investment decisions, distribution decisions, or other decisions of the fiduciary or shall not take specified actions except at the direction of an adviser, then, except to the extent that the governing instrument provides otherwise, the fiduciary shall have no duty to:(1) Monitor the conduct of the adviser;(2) Provide advice to the adviser or consult with the adviser; or(3) Communicate with or warn or apprise any beneficiary or third party concerning instances in which the fiduciary would or might have exercised the fiduciary’s own discretion in a manner different from the manner directed by the adviser.Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the actions of the fiduciary pertaining to matters within the scope of the adviser’s authority (such as confirming that the adviser’s directions have been carried out and recording and reporting actions taken at the adviser’s direction), shall be presumed to be administrative actions taken by the fiduciary solely to allow the fiduciary to perform those duties assigned to the fiduciary under the governing instrument and such administrative actions shall not be deemed to constitute an undertaking by the fiduciary to monitor the adviser or otherwise participate in actions within the scope of the adviser’s authority.(f) For purposes of this section, the term “adviser” shall include a “protector” who shall have all of the power and authority granted to the protector by the terms of the governing instrument, which may include but shall not be limited to:(1) The power to remove and appoint trustees, advisers, trust committee members, and other protectors;(2) The power to modify or amend the governing instrument to achieve favorable tax status or to facilitate the efficient administration of the trust; and(3) The power to modify, expand, or restrict the terms of a power of appointment granted to a beneficiary by the governing instrument.(g) A person who accepts appointment as an adviser of a trust, or acts as an adviser of a trust under this section, submits to personal jurisdiction of this State regarding any matter related to the trust. This provision does not preclude other methods of obtaining jurisdiction over such adviser of a trust.65 Del. Laws, c. 422,\n\n§\n\n 5;69 Del. Laws, c. 279,\n\n§\n\n 1;74 Del.

Excluded cotrustee.(a) If the terms of a governing instrument confer upon a cotrustee, to the exclusion of another cotrustee, the power to take certain actions with respect to the trust, including the power to direct or prevent certain actions of the trustees, the duty and liability of the excluded trustee is as follows:(1) If the terms of the governing instrument confer upon the cotrustee the power to direct certain actions of the excluded trustee, the excluded trustee must act in accordance with the direction and shall have no duty to act in the absence of such direction and is not liable, individually or as a fiduciary, for any loss resulting directly or indirectly from compliance with the direction unless compliance with the direction constitutes wilful misconduct on the part of the directed cotrustee;(2) If the terms of the governing instrument confer upon the cotrustee exclusive authority to exercise any power, the excluded trustee is not liable, individually or as a fiduciary, for any loss resulting directly or indirectly from the action taken by the cotrustee in the exercise of the power, such that the excluded trustee shall not be a fiduciary with respect to any power as to which the governing instrument has conferred upon the cotrustee exclusive authority in accordance with this paragraph (a)(2), but shall remain a fiduciary with respect to any powers or other matters as to which the governing instrument has not conferred exclusive authority on the cotrustee; and(3) The excluded trustee has no duty to monitor the conduct of the cotrustee, provide advice to the cotrustee or consult with or request directions from the cotrustee. The excluded trustee is not required to give notice to any beneficiary of any action taken or not taken by the cotrustee whether or not the excluded trustee agrees with the result. Administrative actions taken by the excluded trustee for the purpose of implementing directions of the cotrustee, including confirming that the directions of the cotrustee have been carried out, do not constitute monitoring of the cotrustee nor do they constitute participation in decisions within the scope of the cotrustee’s authority.(b) The cotrustee holding the power to take certain actions with respect to the trust shall be liable to the beneficiaries with respect to the exercise of the power as if the excluded trustee were not in office and shall have the exclusive obligation to account to the beneficiaries and defend any action brought by the beneficiaries with respect to the exercise of the power.81 Del. Laws, c. 149,\n\n§\n\n1;81 Del. Laws, c. 320,\n\n§\n\n4;§\n\n3314. Limitation on certain fiduciary powers.(a) This section shall apply to:(1) Any trust created under a governing instrument that, but for this section, would permit any of the powers described in subsection (c) of this section to be exercised by the fiduciary unless the governing instrument expressly provides that this section does not apply.(2) For purposes of this section, the term “fiduciary” means any trustee or trust adviser or the personal representative of an estate except to the extent the governing instrument expressly states that such person is not serving in a fiduciary capacity.(b) This section shall not apply to:(1) Any trust during the time that the trust is revocable or amendable by its trustor.(2) A spouse of a decedent or trustor where the spouse is a fiduciary of a testamentary or inter vivos trust for which a marital deduction has been allowed.(3) A fiduciary who possesses in such fiduciary’s individual, nonfiduciary, capacity an unlimited right to appoint all or part of the property held in trust to the fiduciary, the fiduciary’s estate, the fiduciary’s creditors, or the creditors of the fiduciary’s estate.(4) A trust under a governing instrument that by specific reference expressly rejects the application of this section.(5) A trust created under a governing instrument executed on or before August 1, 2008, if, in the case of a fiduciary’s possessing a power described in subsection (c) of this section and dying at any time on or after August 1, 2008, no part of the property of the trust would be included in the gross estate of the fiduciary for federal estate-tax purposes or, notwithstanding that all or some part of the property held in trust would be so included, no federal estate tax would be payable by such estate.(6) A trust created under a governing instrument executed on or before August 1, 2008, if, in the case of a beneficiary’s possessing a power to appoint a trustee and dying at any time on or after August 1, 2008, no part of the property of the trust would be included in the gross estate of the beneficiary for federal estate-tax purposes or, notwithstanding that all or some part of the property held in trust would be so included, no federal estate tax would be payable by such estate.(c) The following powers conferred by a governing instrument upon a fiduciary in that fiduciary’s capacity as a fiduciary shall not be exercised by that fiduciary:(1) The power to make discretionary distributions of either principal or income to or for the benefit of the fiduciary, the fiduciary’s estate, the creditors of the fiduciary, or the creditors of the fiduciary’s estate unless the power is either:a. Limited by an ascertainable standard relating to the fiduciary’s health, education, support, or maintenance within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. §§ 2041 (relating to powers of appointment) and 2514 (relating to powers of appointment); orb. Exercisable by the fiduciary only in conjunction with another person having a substantial interest in the property subject to the power which is adverse to the interest of the fiduciary within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. § 2041(b)(1)(C)(ii).(2) The power to make discretionary distributions of either principal or income to satisfy any of the fiduciary’s personal legal obligations for support or other purposes.(3) The power to make discretionary allocations in the fiduciary’s personal favor of receipts or expenses as between income and principal unless the fiduciary has no power to enlarge or shift any beneficial interest except as an incidental consequence of the discharge of the fiduciary’s duties.(4) The power to exercise any of the powers proscribed in this subsection with regard to an individual other than the fiduciary to the extent that the individual could exercise a similar prohibited power in connection with a trust that benefits the fiduciary.(5) The power to make an election, other than an election under 26 U.S.C. §§ 2056(b)(7) and 2523(f) (relating to the federal estate-tax and gift-tax marital deductions), in a fiduciary capacity that would cause the property over which the election could be made to be included in the gross estate of the fiduciary for federal estate-tax purposes.(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions:(1) If a fiduciary is prohibited by this section from exercising a power conferred upon the fiduciary, the fiduciary nevertheless may exercise that power but shall be limited to distributions for the fiduciary’s health, education, support, or maintenance to the extent otherwise permitted by the terms of the trust.(2) Unless otherwise prohibited by the provisions of this section, a fiduciary may exercise a power described herein in favor of someone other than the fiduciary, the fiduciary’s estate, the creditors of the fiduciary, or the creditors of the fiduciary’s estate.(3) Subject to the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, any purported exercise of a power proscribed by subsection (c) of this section shall be void and of no effect.(e) If a governing instrument creates a power proscribed by this section:(1) If the power is conferred on 2 or more fiduciaries, it may be exercised by the fiduciary or fiduciaries who are not so prohibited as if they were the only fiduciary or fiduciaries.(2) If there is no fiduciary in office who can exercise the power as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the court, upon petition and hearing after such notice as it may direct, shall appoint a fiduciary who is not disqualified and whose term in office shall be as the court directs for the sole purpose of exercising the power that the other fiduciary or fiduciaries cannot exercise.(3) The court may, upon petition by any fiduciary or beneficiary of the trust subject to the power, appoint an additional fiduciary or fiduciaries.(f) No beneficiary of a trust in an individual, fiduciary, or other capacity may appoint, or remove and appoint, a fiduciary who is related or subordinate to the beneficiary within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. § 672(c) unless:(1) The fiduciary’s discretionary power to make distributions to or for the beneficiary is limited by an ascertainable standard relating to the beneficiary’s health, education, support, or maintenance within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. §§ 2041 and 2514;(2) The fiduciary’s discretionary power may not be exercised to satisfy any of the beneficiary’s legal obligations for support or other purposes; and(3) The fiduciary’s discretionary power may not be exercised to grant to the beneficiary a general power to appoint property of the trust to the beneficiary, the beneficiary’s estate, or the creditors thereof within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. § 2041.(4) This subsection shall not apply if the appointment of the fiduciary by the beneficiary may be made only in conjunction with another person having a substantial interest in the property of the trust subject to the power which is adverse to the exercise of the power in favor of the beneficiary within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. § 2041(b)(1)(C)(ii).76 Del. Laws, c. 254,\n\n§\n\n 6;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n3315. Trustee’s exercise of discretion; review by court; discretionary interests.(a) Where discretion is conferred upon the fiduciary with respect to the exercise of a power, its exercise by the fiduciary shall be considered to be proper unless the court determines that the discretion has been abused within the meaning of § 187 of the Restatement (Second) of Trusts, not §§ 50 and 60 of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts.(b) A beneficiary eligible to receive distributions from a trust in the discretion of a fiduciary has a discretionary interest in the trust. A discretionary interest in a trust is a mere expectancy, not a property right. A beneficiary eligible to receive distributions from a trust in the discretion of a fiduciary, even if subject to an ascertainable standard (as defined in Treas. Reg. § 20.2041-1(c)(2) (26 CFR § 20.2041-1(c)(2)) or any successor provision thereto), has a discretionary interest in the trust. An interest that includes mandatory distribution language such as “shall” but is qualified by discretionary distribution language is a discretionary interest. A beneficiary that has a discretionary interest in a trust shall not be deemed to have a right to compel a distribution from the trust. Nothing within this subsection, however, shall be deemed to alter the standard of review of the discretion of the fiduciary under subsection (a) of this section. A creditor may not directly or indirectly compel the distribution of a discretionary interest except to the extent expressly granted by the terms of a governing instrument in accordance with § 3536(a) of this title.(c) In connection with the exercise of a discretionary power conferred on a trustee or other fiduciary of a trust in the trust’s governing instrument, the trustee’s or other fiduciary’s decision whether or not to consider 1 or more letters of wishes, as defined in § 3301(g) of this title, is subject to the standard of review of the discretion of the trustee or other fiduciary under subsection (a) of this section.(1) The trustee or other fiduciary may consider 1 or more letters of wishes, whenever created, and whether or not the governing instrument is ambiguous, if the letter of wishes meets all of the following:a. Has been delivered to a trustee of the trust by or on behalf of the trustor.b. Reflects the trustor’s intent contemporaneous with the date of execution of the governing instrument, which intent may be reflected in facts and circumstances known to the trustor, or not known to or anticipated by the trustor, as of the date of execution of the governing instrument.c. Is not inconsistent with any provision of the governing instrument.(2) A trustee’s or other fiduciary’s decision not to consider a letter of wishes with respect to an unambiguous provision of a governing instrument is not an abuse of discretion under subsection (a) of this section.(3) A trustee’s or other fiduciary’s decision not to consider a letter of wishes not meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not an abuse of discretion under subsection (a) of this section.(4) A trustee’s or other fiduciary’s decision to consider a letter of wishes meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, with respect to an ambiguous provision of a governing instrument, is not an abuse of discretion under subsection (a) of this section.(5) A letter of wishes is not binding on a trustee or other fiduciary under the governing instrument. A trustee or other fiduciary does not have a duty to follow the letter of wishes, and the fact that a trustee or other fiduciary does or does not exercise a discretionary power in accordance with the letter of wishes does not create an inference that the trustee or other fiduciary improperly exercised the power or abused the trustee’s or other fiduciary’s discretion under subsection (a) of this section.(6) Except as provided under the terms of the governing instrument or by court order, the trustee or other fiduciary does not have a duty to provide any beneficiary a copy of a letter of wishes.76 Del. Laws, c. 254,\n\n§\n\n 7;83 Del. Laws, c. 69,\n\n§\n\n2;84 Del. Laws, c. 391,\n\n§\n\n4;85 Del. Laws, c. 160,\n\n§\n\n2;§\n\n3316. Substituted property; equivalent value; fiduciary duty.Except as otherwise expressly provided by the terms of a governing instrument, if a trustor has a power to substitute property of equivalent value, the fiduciary responsible for investment decisions has a fiduciary duty to determine that the substituted property is of equivalent value prior to allowing the substitution.77 Del. Laws, c. 330,\n\n§\n\n 5;79 Del. Laws, c. 197,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n3317. Cofiduciaries and co-nonfiduciaries; duty to keep informed.Except as otherwise provided in a governing instrument, each trust fiduciary (including trustees, advisers, protectors, and other fiduciaries), and each trust nonfiduciary, has a duty upon request to keep all of the fiduciaries and nonfiduciaries for the trust reasonably informed about the administration of the trust with respect to any specific duty or function being performed by such fiduciary or nonfiduciary to the extent that providing such information to the other fiduciaries and nonfiduciaries is reasonably necessary for the other fiduciaries and nonfiduciaries to perform their duties; provided, however, that:(1) A fiduciary or nonfiduciary requesting and receiving any such information shall have no duty to: monitor the conduct of the fiduciary or nonfiduciary providing the information; provide advice to or consult with the fiduciary or nonfiduciary providing the information; or communicate with or warn or apprise any beneficiary or third party concerning instances in which the fiduciary or nonfiduciary receiving the information would or might have exercised the fiduciary's or nonfiduciary's own discretion in a manner different from the manner in which such discretion was actually exercised by the fiduciary or nonfiduciary providing the information; and(2) A fiduciary or nonfiduciary providing any such information shall have no duty to: monitor the conduct of the fiduciary or nonfiduciary requesting and receiving the information; provide advice to or consult with the fiduciary or nonfiduciary requesting and receiving the information; or communicate with or warn or apprise any beneficiary or third party concerning instances in which the fiduciary or nonfiduciary providing the information would or might have exercised the fiduciary's or nonfiduciary's own discretion in a manner different from the manner in which such discretion was actually exercised by the fiduciary or nonfiduciary requesting and receiving the information.77 Del. Laws, c. 330,\n\n§\n\n 6;81 Del. Laws, c. 320,\n\n§\n\n4;§§\n\n3318-3320. [Reserved.]§\n\n3321. Applicability of chapter; definitions.Repealed 76 Del. Laws, c. 254, § 8.§\n\n3322. Fiduciary agency contracts; delegation.(a) A fiduciary may appoint agents to assist in the performance of the fiduciary’s duties, pay such agents from the fiduciary fund and delegate investment, management, or other fiduciary duties to any such agent, including an agent who is a cofiduciary.(b) When a fiduciary, acting in the fiduciary’s discretion and not at the direction of any adviser, appoints an agent to assist in the performance of the fiduciary’s duties, the standard of care applicable to the fiduciary when personally performing such duties shall continue to apply to the fiduciary with respect to selecting and hiring the agent, paying the agent from the fiduciary fund, establishing the scope and specific terms of the agency relationship, and overseeing the agent’s actions and continuing the agency relationship, but the fiduciary shall not otherwise be liable for the conduct of such agent. The foregoing rule shall apply even if:(1) The aggregate amount paid to the agent and the fiduciary from the fiduciary fund exceeds the amount otherwise payable from the fiduciary fund to the fiduciary under subchapter V of Chapter 35 of this title or other applicable law; or(2) The standard of care applicable to the agent is a lower standard than the standard applicable to the fiduciary when personally performing duties to be performed by the agent.(c) When a fiduciary delegates investment, management, or other fiduciary duties to an agent, such delegation shall not cause the fiduciary to cease to be a fiduciary or cause the agent to be a fiduciary.65 Del. Laws, c. 422,\n\n§\n\n 6;73 Del. Laws, c. 47,\n\n§\n\n 1;74 Del. Laws, c. 82,\n\n§\n\n 7;75 Del. Laws, c. 300,\n\n§\n\n 1;79 Del. Laws, c. 352,\n\n§\n\n 3;82 Del. Laws, c. 52,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n3323. Cofiduciaries and co-nonfiduciaries.(a) Unless provided otherwise by the governing instrument, any power vested in 3 or more fiduciaries or nonfiduciaries by the governing instrument or by law may be exercised by a majority of such fiduciaries or nonfiduciaries and a majority of fiduciaries or nonfiduciaries named in a governing instrument may designate 1 of such fiduciaries or nonfiduciaries to perform ministerial functions on behalf of all such fiduciaries or nonfiduciaries. A fiduciary or nonfiduciary who dissents from the action of the majority is not liable to anyone having an interest in the fiduciary fund, or to the other fiduciaries or nonfiduciaries, if such dissent is evidenced by a writing delivered to the majority of the fiduciaries or nonfiduciaries.(b) This section does not excuse a cofiduciary or co-nonfiduciary from liability for failure to participate in the administration of the fiduciary fund or for failure to attempt to prevent a breach of trust, or for failure to seek advice and guidance from the court in a recurring situation, unless otherwise expressly provided by the governing instrument.65 Del.

General powers of trustee.(a) A trustee, without authorization by the court, may exercise:(1) Powers conferred by the terms of the trust; and(2) Except as limited by the terms of the trust, any other powers conferred by this chapter.(b) Except as modified by the terms of a trust, the exercise of a power is subject to the fiduciary duties otherwise prescribed by law.72 Del.

However, in the event that the fiduciary is determined by a court to have breached a fiduciary duty related to such matter, the court may, in its discretion, deny such fiduciary the right to have all or some part of the fiduciary’s counsel fees paid from such fund and may require the fiduciary to reimburse any such fees and expenses that have been previously paid.76 Del.

Effect of formula clauses in certain wills and trusts.(a) A governing instrument, such as a will or trust of a decedent, who dies after December 31, 2009, and before January 1, 2011, that contains a formula referring to the “unified credit,” “estate tax exemption,” “applicable exemption amount,” “applicable credit amount,” “applicable exclusion amount,” “generation-skipping transfer tax exemption,” “GST exemption,” “marital deduction,” “maximum marital deduction,” or “unlimited marital deduction,” or that measures a share of an estate or trust based on the amount that can pass free of federal estate taxes or the amount that can pass free of federal generation-skipping transfer taxes, or that is otherwise based on a similar provision of federal estate tax or generation-skipping transfer tax law, shall be presumed to refer to the federal estate tax and generation-skipping transfer tax laws as they applied to estates of decedents dying on December 31, 2009. This provision shall not apply to a will or trust that is executed or amended after December 31, 2009, or that manifests an intent that a contrary rule shall apply. Furthermore, this provision shall not apply in cases where the application of this provision would cause: (i) a decrease in the amount passing to 1 trust and a substantially equal increase in the amount passing to another trust if the terms of both trusts concerning beneficial interests are substantially similar; (ii) a decrease in the amount passing to a trust and a substantially equal increase in the amount passing to an individual if the individual is eligible to receive unlimited discretionary principal distributions from the trust or (iii) a decrease in the amount passing to 1 trust and a substantially equal combined total increase in the amount passing to another trust or trusts and individuals described in clauses (i) and (ii). For purposes of determining whether the terms of 2 trusts concerning beneficial interests are substantially the same:(1) Any provision of the will or trust requiring, or expressing a preference for, distributions from 1 trust rather than from the other trust shall be disregarded;(2) a. A trust intended to be a general power of appointment marital trust under § 2056(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. § 2056(b)(5)]; orb.

Chapter 11].(c) Any person interested under a will or trust may bring a proceeding under § 6504 of Title 10 to determine whether the decedent intended that the references under subsection (a) of this section be construed with respect to the law as it existed after December 31, 2009. Such a proceeding must be commenced prior to January 1, 2012.(d) The presumption described in subsection (a) of this section shall not apply if fiduciaries such as personal representatives or trustees serving under the governing instrument, who are not interested fiduciaries, elect to opt out of the application of subsection (a) of this section as to all or any part of the governing instrument and no beneficiary under the governing instrument objects to the election within 30 days following receipt of written notice of the election. A fiduciary is interested if: (i) the fiduciary is a beneficiary under the governing instrument whose beneficial interest would or might change in value by reason of the election; (ii) the fiduciary may be removed and replaced by a beneficiary described in clause (i) of this subsection above; or (iii) the fiduciary is an individual legally obligated to support a beneficiary described in clause (i) of this subsection above. If all of the fiduciaries are interested, this subsection shall have no application.(e) Whenever the term “pass” or “passing” is used in this section, the term shall relate to an amount distributable or allocable under the governing instrument as result of the decedent’s death.77 Del. Laws, c. 379,\n\n§\n\n 1;78 Del. Laws, c. 117,\n\n§\n\n 5;§\n\n3336. Appointment of successor trustee [For application of this section, see 79 Del. Laws, c. 172, § 6].If a trust has no serving trustee for any reason, including the death, incapacity, removal or resignation of the last serving trustee of the trust, or due to the renunciation or declination of the last named successor trustee of the trust of its appointment as such, and if the provisions of the governing instrument do not include any provisions which can be effectively used to appoint a successor trustee, and if the only remaining dispositive provisions of the trust then require distribution of the remaining property of the trust to 1 or more beneficiaries (whether outright, or to 1 or more other trusts which do have a serving trustee), then the taking beneficiaries of the trust, by unanimous vote, may name a successor trustee of the trust without the approval of the Court of Chancery. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the person entitled to vote with respect to a beneficiary which is another trust which has a serving trustee is the trustee or trustees of such trust.79 Del.

The appointed designated representative must not be the trustor or related or subordinate to the trustor within the meaning of § 672(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. § 672(c)], as amended; andc. The trustor, within 30 days of appointment of the designated representative under this paragraph (a)(4) for a living, minor beneficiary or for an incapacitated beneficiary, must provide written notice to the surviving and competent parent or parents or custodial parent (in cases where 1 parent has sole custody of the beneficiary), or guardian of the property of the beneficiary who will be represented by the appointed designated representative; or(5) To the extent that a designated representative is not appointed and serving in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section, appointment by a beneficiary to act as a designated representative of such beneficiary.(b) A designated representative may be appointed under paragraph (a) of this section:(1) For purposes of representing a beneficiary in accordance with § 3303(d) of this title;(2) For purposes of representing a minor beneficiary, a beneficiary who is incapacitated, an unborn beneficiary, or a beneficiary whose identity or location is unknown and not reasonably ascertainable, in any nonjudicial matter, as such term is defined in § 3303(e) of this title;(3) With respect to appointment under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, for purposes of representing the appointing beneficiary, in any nonjudicial matter, as such term is defined in § 3303(e) of this title.(c) For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, any designated representative then serving may represent and bind the applicable beneficiary for purposes of any nonjudicial matter, as such term is defined in § 3303(e) of this title, notwithstanding that the governing instrument does not restrict or eliminate the right of such beneficiary to be informed of the beneficiary’s interest in the trust.(d) A designated representative shall be presumed to be a fiduciary. A person who accepts an appointment as a designated representative of a trust, or acts as a designated representative of a trust under this section, submits to personal jurisdiction of this State regarding any matter related to the trust. This provision does not preclude other methods of obtaining jurisdiction over such designated representative of a trust.80 Del. Laws, c. 89,\n\n§\n\n 1;83 Del. Laws, c. 69,\n\n§\n\n2;84 Del. Laws, c. 182,\n\n§\n\n5;84 Del. Laws, c. 391,\n\n§\n\n6;§\n\n3340. Place of administration [For application of this section, see 80 Del. Laws, c. 153, § 5].For purposes of this title, and without limiting other ways in which a trust may be considered to be administered in this State, a trust is administered in this State if:(1) The sole trustee is an individual residing in this State or a corporation or other entity having an office for the conduct of trust business in this State;(2) The trust has more than 1 trustee only 1 of which is a corporation or other entity and that corporation or other entity has an office for the conduct of trust business in this State; or(3) The trust has more than 1 trustee all of whom are individuals and1/2or more of whom reside in this State.80 Del. Laws, c. 153,\n\n§\n\n 3;84 Del. Laws, c. 182,\n\n§\n\n6;§\n\n3341. Consequences of trust merger and similar transactions [For application of this section, see 80 Del. Laws, c. 153, § 5].Whenever any trust (a “transferor trust”) is merged with and into another trust (the “transferee trust”):(1) The separate existence of the transferor trust shall cease and the transferee trust shall possess all of the rights and privileges, and shall be subject to all of the obligations of, the transferor trust;(2) All of the property (including title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise) and other interests of the transferor trust shall be thereafter treated as effectively the property and interests of the transferee trust as they were the property and interests of the transferor trust prior to the merger;(3) No such property or interests shall revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the merger;(4) In cases where the initial funding of the transferee trust occurs by reason of the merger, unless the governing instrument of the transferee trust expressly states that 1 or more powers of appointment exercisable over the property of the transferor trust shall not be exercisable over the property of the transferee trust: (i) any power of appointment exercisable over property of the transferor trust shall be exercisable, in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument of the transferor trust, over property of the transferee trust, and (ii) any instrument in writing, executed prior to the merger, purporting to exercise a power of appointment over property of the transferor trust shall be treated as a valid exercise of a power of appointment over property of the transferee trust to the same extent that the appointment purportedly made pursuant to the instrument would have been a valid exercise of the power of appointment granted over property of the transferor trust; and(5) In cases where the initial funding of the transferee trust occurs prior to the merger, any power of appointment exercisable over property of either trust participating in the merger shall, following the merger, be exercisable over property of the transferee trust only to the extent expressly provided by the terms of the instrument of merger or other written documents effecting the merger; provided, however, that if any person holds substantially identical powers of appointment over all of the property of each trust participating in the merger, such person's power of appointment over the property of the transferee trust shall be exercisable over all of the property of the transferee trust following the merger unless the instrument of merger or other written document effecting the merger expressly provides otherwise.Furthermore, all rights of creditors and all liens upon the property of the transferor trust shall be preserved unimpaired and all debts, liabilities, and duties of the transferor trust shall thenceforth attach to the transferee trust and may be enforced against the transferee trust to the same extent as if the transferor trust’s debts, liabilities, and duties had been incurred or contracted by the transferee trust. Except to the extent provided in paragraph (5) of this section, the terms of the governing instrument of the transferee trust shall, following the merger, control the administration and disposition of the property of the transferee trust, including any such property obtained by the transferee trust by reason of the merger. Furthermore, any transaction in which all of the property of a trust is appointed or otherwise transferred to another trust or to the same trust as modified after such appointment, whether pursuant to § 3528 of this title, the terms of a governing instrument or otherwise, shall be treated as a merger within the meaning of this section with the appointing or transferring trust and the recipient trust treated as a transferor trust and transferee trust, respectively, for purposes of applying the provisions of this section to the transaction. This section is not intended, nor shall it be construed, to grant to any trustee a right or power to merge trusts but rather this section is intended only to describe certain consequences of a trust merger in cases where the merger is authorized by other applicable law. Except as expressly provided in clause (ii) of paragraph (4) of this section, this section is not intended, nor shall it be construed, to address the validity or effect of any instrument in writing, executed prior to a trust merger, purporting to exercise a power of appointment over property of any trust participating in a trust merger.80 Del. Laws, c. 153,\n\n§\n\n 3;81 Del. Laws, c. 149,\n\n§\n\n1;81 Del. Laws, c. 320,\n\n§\n\n4;82 Del. Laws, c. 52,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n3342. Modification of trust by consent while trustor is living.(a) Unless the trust’s governing instrument expressly provides that the governing instrument may not be modified under this section, under a nonjudicial settlement agreement under § 3338 of this title or similar provision of law, or under a modification agreement, an irrevocable trust may be modified by the addition of a new provision or the modification of any existing provision—so long as such provision could have been included in the governing instrument of a trust were such trust created upon the date of the modification—by written consent or written nonobjection of all of the trust’s trustors, all then serving fiduciaries and all beneficiaries having an interest in the trust, regardless of whether the modification may violate a material purpose of the trust; provided, however, that unless the trustor, or a person acting on behalf of the trustor, confirms in writing that the transfer in trust is an incomplete gift for federal gift tax purposes, neither a trustor nor, on behalf of a trustor, a guardian or an agent under a power of attorney, may represent and bind any beneficiary (other than the trustor) with respect to the modification, notwithstanding any provision in the governing instrument, or applicable law, that provides that the trustor may represent or bind 1 or more beneficiaries. A trustor’s power to provide a written consent or written nonobjection to a trust’s modification may be exercised:(1) By an agent under a power of attorney only to the extent expressly authorized by the power of attorney or the terms of the trust’s governing instrument; or(2) If an agent under a power of attorney is not so authorized, by the guardian of the trustor’s property (or similar court-appointed representative) with the approval of the court supervising the guardian (or similar representative).(b) No fiduciary shall have a duty to consent to any proposed modification nor, absent wilful misconduct, have any liability to any person having an interest in the trust for failure to consent to any proposed modification.(c) Any interested person, including the trustor, may bring a proceeding in the Court of Chancery to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of a modification adopted under this section, including but not limited to determining whether the representation as provided in § 3547 of this title was adequate; provided, however, that any such person may waive the right to contest the modification.(d) This section shall apply to any trust administered under the laws of this State.80 Del. Laws, c. 340,\n\n§\n\n1;81 Del. Laws, c. 149,\n\n§\n\n1;81 Del. Laws, c. 320,\n\n§\n\n4;82 Del. Laws, c. 52,\n\n§\n\n1;82 Del. Laws, c. 278,\n\n§\n\n1;83 Del. Laws, c. 69,\n\n§\n\n2;§\n\n3343. Authority to allocate trustee duties among multiple trustees.(a) The power to appoint a successor trustee under a governing instrument shall be deemed to include the power to appoint multiple successor trustees. A presently exercisable power to remove and replace a trustee under a governing instrument shall be deemed to include the power to appoint additional trustees to serve with the current trustee. The power to appoint multiple successor trustees and the power to appoint additional trustees shall be deemed to include the power to allocate various trustee powers (which trustee powers may include the power to direct or prevent certain actions of the trustees) exclusively to 1 or some of the trustees serving from time to time.(b) All of the provisions of a governing instrument generally applicable to the trustees (including, but not limited to, the provisions regarding trustee qualifications, resignation, removal, standard of care, indemnification, compensation, and the scope and nature of the restrictions, limitations, and immunities applicable when exercising powers and authority) shall apply to trustees appointed under this section so that, for example (but not by way of limitation):(1) Provisions waiving certain duties when exercising certain investment powers shall apply equally to trustees appointed under this section;(2) Provisions permitting the removal and replacement of a trustee subject to various limitations and conditions shall apply equally to trustees appointed under this section; and(3) Provisions proscribing the trustor and trust beneficiaries and persons or entities related or subordinate to the trustor and any trust beneficiary from being eligible to serve as a trustee shall apply equally to proscribe all of those persons from serving as trustees appointed under this section.(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, if an appointment under this section confers upon a cotrustee, to the exclusion of another cotrustee, the power to take certain actions with respect to the trust, including the power to direct or prevent certain actions of the trustees, then:(1) The duty and liability of the excluded trustee and the cotrustee holding the power, whether that be the powers of an excluded trustee or cotrustee described under § 3313A(a)(1) or § 3313A(a)(2) of this title, shall be as set forth under § 3313A of this title; and(2) The excluded trustee shall have the rights of a trustee that has been removed as trustee of the trust under applicable law and the terms of the governing instrument, to seek, with respect to the power and authority so excluded as a result of an appointment under this section, a judicial proceeding or nonjudicial matter, as defined in § 3303(e) of this title.(d) Any powers granted in subsection (a) of this section to appoint additional trustees, which are exercised in such a manner as to modify the duties of an existing trustee, shall not become effective until 30 days after the receipt by the existing trustee of a written notice—from the person or persons authorized to appoint additional trustees—detailing such changes. The 30-day notice requirement may be waived by the existing trustee.(e) Except as otherwise expressly provided by the terms of a governing instrument, this section shall be available to any trust that is administered in this State or otherwise governed by the laws of this State.82 Del. Laws, c. 52,\n\n§\n\n1;82 Del. Laws, c. 278,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n3344. Income tax reimbursement or payment.(a) Unless the terms of the governing instrument expressly provide that a trustor may not be reimbursed by a trust for the trustor’s personal income tax liability, if the trustor of a trust is treated under 26 U.S.C. § 671 et seq. as the owner of all or part of the trust, the trustee (other than a trustee who is the trustor or a person who is a “related or subordinate party” with respect to the trustor within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. § 672(c)) may, in the trustee’s sole discretion, or at the direction or with the consent of an adviser (who is not the trustor or a person who is a “related or subordinate party” with respect to the trustor within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. § 672(c)), reimburse the trustor for any amount of the trustor’s personal federal, state, county, metropolitan-region, city, local, foreign, or other income tax liability that is attributable to the inclusion of the trust’s income, capital gains, deductions, and credits in the calculation of the trustor’s taxable income. The trustee may pay such amount to the trustor directly or may pay such amount to an appropriate taxing authority on the trustor’s behalf, as the trustee determines in the trustee’s sole discretion. No policy of insurance on the trustor’s life held in the trust nor the cash value of any such policy nor the proceeds of any loan secured by an interest in the policy may be used to reimburse the trustor or to pay an appropriate taxing authority on the trustor’s behalf. Neither the trustee’s power to make payments to, or for the benefit of, the trustor under this section, nor the trustee’s decision to exercise such power in favor of the trustor, shall cause the trustor to be treated as a beneficiary of the trust for purposes of § 3536(c) of this title or for other purposes of Delaware law.(b) The provisions of this section shall not apply if the application of this section would disqualify a trust for, or reduce the amount of, a marital or charitable deduction otherwise available to any person for state or federal income, gift, or estate tax purposes.82 Del. Laws, c. 52,\n\n§\n\n1;83 Del. Laws, c. 69,\n\n§\n\n2;§\n\n3345. Beneficiary well-being trust.(a) This section applies to any trust the governing instrument of which makes express reference to this section and states that this section, or any part of this section, shall apply. A trust that makes such a reference to this section is known as a “beneficiary well-being trust” and is deemed to include the powers, duties, rights, and interests of the beneficiaries, trustees, and advisers, within the meaning of “advisers” under § 3313 of this title, as provided in this section.(b) As used in this section, “beneficiary well-being programs” means seminars, courses, programs, workshops, counselors, personal coaches, short-term university programs, group or 1-on-1 meetings, counseling, family meetings, family retreats, family reunions, and custom programs, all of which having 1 or more of the following purposes:(1) Preparing each generation of beneficiaries for inheriting wealth by providing the beneficiaries individually or as a group with multigenerational estate and asset planning, assistance with navigating intergenerational asset transfers, developing wealth management and money skills, financial literacy and acumen, business fundamentals, entrepreneurship, knowledge of family businesses, and philanthropy.(2) Educating beneficiaries about the beneficiaries’ family history, the family’s values, family governance, family dynamics, family mental health and well-being, and connection among family members.(c) The trustees and advisers of a beneficiary well-being trust shall provide the beneficiaries individually or as a group with beneficiary well-being programs at such times and in such manner as set forth in the provisions of the governing instrument, or in the absence of such provisions, then at such times and in such manner as the trustee may determine is appropriate, in accordance with § 3315 of this title.(d) Subject to the fiduciary duties and authority of the trustees and advisers under the governing instrument and applicable law, the trustees and advisers of a beneficiary well-being trust shall pay from the trust the costs and expenses of beneficiary well-being programs.(1) The payments under this subsection are an expense of administration of the trust to the extent permitted by law.(2) A trustee itself may provide beneficiary well-being programs, and may select, hire, retain, and pay providers of beneficiary well-being programs whether or not the providers are third parties or affiliates of the trustee within the meaning of § 3312 of this title.(3) Each provider of beneficiary well-being programs is entitled to payment for providing a beneficiary well-being program, and a trustee is entitled to the full fiduciary compensation to which the trustee is otherwise entitled as trustee without diminution for the fees and costs of the beneficiary well-being program, without prior notice or disclosure to any beneficiary of the trust.(e) To effectuate this section, the governing instrument may provide for additional powers, duties, rights, and interests that may expand the purpose or scope of a beneficiary well-being program.84 Del.
