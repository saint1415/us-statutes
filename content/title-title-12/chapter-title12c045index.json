Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4510. Single custodianship.A transfer may be made only for 1 minor and only 1 person may be the custodian. All custodial property held under this chapter by the same custodian for the benefit of the same minor constitutes a single custodianship.70 Del. Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4511.

Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4512. Care of custodial property.(a) A custodian shall:(1) Take control of custodial property;(2) Register or record title to custodial property if appropriate; and(3) Collect, hold, manage, invest and reinvest custodial property.(b) In dealing with custodial property, a custodian shall observe the standard of care that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with property of another in accordance with the standard of care set forth in § 3302 of this title and is not limited by any other statute restricting investments by fiduciaries. If a custodian has a special skill or expertise or is named custodian on the basis of representations of special skill or expertise, the custodian shall use that skill or expertise. However, a custodian, in the custodian’s discretion and without liability to the minor or the minor’s estate, may retain any custodial property received from a transferor.(c) A custodian may invest in or pay premiums on life insurance or endowment policies on:(1) The life of the minor only if the minor or the minor’s estate is the sole beneficiary, or(2) The life of another person in whom the minor has an insurable interest only to the extent that the minor, the minor’s estate or the custodian in the capacity of custodian is the irrevocable beneficiary.(d) A custodian at all times, shall keep custodial property separate and distinct from all other property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly as custodial property of the minor. Custodial property consisting of an undivided interest is so identified if the minor’s interest is held as a tenant in common and is fixed. Custodial property subject to recordation is so identified if it is recorded and custodial property subject to registration is so identified if it is either registered or held in an account designated in the name of the custodian, followed in substance by the words: “as a custodian for (name of minor) under the Delaware Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.”(e) A custodian shall keep records of all transactions with respect to custodial property, including information necessary for the preparation of the minor’s tax returns, and shall make them available for inspection at reasonable intervals by a parent or legal representative of the minor or by the minor if the minor has attained the age of 14 years.70 Del. Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4513. Powers of custodian.(a) A custodian acting in a custodial capacity has all the rights, powers and authority over custodial property that unmarried adult owners have over their own property, but a custodian may exercise those rights, powers and authority in that capacity only.(b) This section does not relieve a custodian from liability for breach of § 4512 of this title.70 Del. Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4514. Use of custodial property.(a) A custodian may deliver or pay to the minor or expend for the minor’s benefit so much of the custodial property as the custodian considers advisable for the use and benefit of the minor, without court order and without regard to:(1) The duty or ability of the custodian personally or of any other person to support the minor, or(2) Any other income or property of the minor which may be applicable or available for that purpose.(b) On petition of an interested person or the minor, if the minor has attained the age of 14 years, the court may order the custodian to deliver or pay to the minor or expend for the minor’s benefit so much of the custodial property as the court considers advisable for the use and benefit of the minor.(c) A delivery, payment or expenditure under this section is in addition to, not in substitution for, and does not affect any obligation of a person to support the minor.70 Del. Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4515. Custodian’s expenses, compensation and bond.(a) A custodian is entitled to reimbursement from custodial property for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of the custodian’s duties.(b) Except for one who is a transferor under § 4504 of this title, a custodian has a noncumulative election during each calendar year to charge reasonable compensation for services performed during that year.(c) Except as provided in § 4518(f) of this title, a custodian need not give a bond.70 Del. Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4516. Exemption of third person from liability.A third person, in good faith and without court order may act on the instructions of or otherwise deal with any person purporting to make a transfer or purporting to act in the capacity of a custodian and, in the absence of knowledge, is not responsible for determining:(1) The validity of the purported custodian’s designation;(2) The propriety of or the authority under this chapter for any act of the purported custodian;(3) The validity of propriety under this chapter of any instrument or instructions executed or given either by the person purporting to make a transfer or by the purported custodian; or(4) The propriety of the application of any property of the minor delivered to the purported custodian.70 Del. Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4517. Liability to third persons.(a) A claim based on:(1) A contract entered into by a custodian acting in a custodial capacity;(2) An obligation arising from the ownership or control of custodial property; or(3) A tort committed during the custodianshipmay be asserted against the custodial property by proceeding against the custodian in the custodial capacity, whether or not the custodian or the minor is personally liable therefor.(b) A custodian is not personally liable:(1) On a contract properly entered into in the custodial capacity, unless the custodian fails to reveal that capacity and to identify the custodianship in the contract; or(2) For an obligation arising from control of custodial property or for a tort committed during the custodianship, unless the custodian is personally at fault.(c) A minor is not personally liable for an obligation arising from ownership of custodial property or for a tort committed during the custodianship, unless the minor is personally at fault.70 Del. Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4518. Renunciation, resignation, death or removal of custodian; designation of successor custodian.(a) A person nominated under § 4503 of this title or designated under § 4509 of this title as custodian may decline to serve by delivering a written disclaimer to the person who made the nomination or to the transferor or the transferor’s legal representative. If the event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred and no substitute custodian able, willing and eligible to serve was nominated under § 4503 of this title, the person who made the nomination may nominate a substitute custodian under § 4503 of this title; otherwise the transferor or the transferor’s legal representative shall designate a substitute custodian at the time of the transfer, in either case from among the persons eligible to serve as custodian for that kind of property under § 4509(a) of this title. The custodian so designated has the rights of a successor custodian.(b) A custodian at any time may designate a trust company or an adult other than a transferor under § 4504 of this title as successor custodian by executing and dating an instrument of designation before a subscribing witness other than the successor. If the instrument of designation does not contain or is not accompanied by the resignation of the custodian, the designation of the successor does not take effect until the custodian resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or is removed.(c) A custodian may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the minor if the minor has attained the age of 14 years and to the successor custodian and by delivering the custodial property to the successor custodian.(d) If a custodian is ineligible, dies or becomes incapacitated without having effectively designated a successor and the minor has attained the age of 14 years, the minor may designate as successor custodian, in the manner prescribed in subsection (b) of this section, an adult member of the minor’s family, a guardian of the minor or a trust company. If the minor has not attained the age of 14 years or fails to act within 60 days after the ineligibility, death or incapacity, the guardian of the minor becomes successor custodian. If the minor has no guardian or the guardian declines to act, the transferor, the legal representative of the transferor or of the custodian, an adult member of the minor’s family or any other interested person may petition the court to designate a successor custodian.(e) A custodian who declines to serve under subsection (a) of this section or resigns under subsection (c) of this section or the legal representative of a deceased or incapacitated custodian, as soon as practicable, shall put the custodial property and records in the possession and control of the successor custodian. The successor custodian by action may enforce the obligation to deliver custodial property and records and becomes responsible for each item as received.(f) A transferor, the legal representative of a transferor, an adult member of the minor’s family, a guardian of the person of the minor, the guardian of the minor or the minor if the minor has attained the age of 14 years may petition the court to remove the custodian for cause and to designate a successor custodian other than a transferor under § 4504 of this title or to require the custodian to give appropriate bond.70 Del. Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;71 Del. Laws, c. 196,\n\n§§\n\n 9, 10;§\n\n4519. Accounting by and determination of liability of custodian.(a) A minor who has attained the age of 14 years, the minor’s guardian of the person or legal representative, an adult member of the minor’s family, a transferor or a transferor’s legal representative may petition the Court:(1) For an accounting by the custodian or the custodian’s legal representative; or(2) For a determination of responsibility, as between the custodial property and the custodian personally, for claims against the custodial property unless the responsibility has been adjudicated in an action under § 4517 of this title to which the minor or the minor’s legal representative was a party.(b) A successor custodian may petition the court for an accounting by the predecessor custodian.(c) The Court, in a proceeding under this chapter or in any other proceeding, may require or permit the custodian or the custodian’s legal representative to account.(d) If a custodian is removed under § 4518(f) of this title, the Court shall require an accounting and order delivery of the custodial property and records to the successor custodian and the execution of all instruments required for transfer of the custodial property.70 Del. Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4520. Termination of custodianship.The custodian shall transfer in an appropriate manner the custodial property to the minor or to the minor’s estate upon the earlier of:(1) The minor’s attainment of 21 years of age with respect to custodial property transferred under § 4504 or § 4505 of this title;(2) The minor’s attainment of 18 years of age with respect to custodial property transferred under § 4506 or § 4507 of this title; or(3) The minor’s death.70 Del. Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4521. Applicability.This chapter applies to a transfer within the scope of § 4502 of this title made after June 26, 1996, if:(1) The transfer purports to have been made under the Delaware Uniform Gifts to Minors Act; or(2) The instrument by which the transfer purports to have been made uses in substance the designation “as custodian under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act” or “as custodian under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act” of any other state, and the application of this chapter is necessary to validate the transfer.70 Del. Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4522. Effect on existing custodianships.(a) Any transfer of custodial property, as now defined in this chapter, made before June 26, 1996, is validated notwithstanding that there was no specific authority in the Delaware Uniform Gifts to Minors Act for the coverage of custodial property of that kind or for a transfer from that source at the time the transfer was made.(b) This chapter applies to all transfers made before June 26, 1996, in a manner and form prescribed in the Delaware Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, except insofar as the application impairs constitutionally vested rights or extends the duration of custodianships in existence on June 26, 1996.(c) Sections 4501 and 4520 of this title with respect to the age of a minor for whom custodial property is held under this chapter do not apply to custodial property held in a custodianship that terminated because of the minor’s attainment of the age of 18 after January 1, 1975, and before June 26, 1996.70 Del. Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4523. Short title.This chapter may be cited as the “Delaware Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.”70 Del. Laws, c. 393,\n\n§\n\n 1;",
