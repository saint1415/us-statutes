      "text": "An action to determine and quiet the title of real property may be brought by anyone having or claiming an interest therein, or by the holder of any mortgage, mortgage deed, trust deed or any other written instrument which may operate as a mortgage, in an action brought to foreclose the said mortgage, mortgage deed, trust deed or such other written instrument, whether in or out of possession of the same, against any person or persons, claiming title thereto, or parcel or portion thereof, or lien thereon, whether such lien be a mortgage or otherwise. Any number of tracts of land may be embraced in the same action, whether claimed by different persons or not; and in instances where a tract of land title to which is sought to be quieted lies within more than one county such action may be brought in any county in which part of said tract lies. Title may be quieted against the owner or holder of any mortgage, claim of lien or other encumbrance, where the owner or holder of such mortgage, lien or encumbrance has permitted same to become barred by statute of limitations, and where the record or documentary evidence reflects that the required time to bar such mortgage or other lien has elapsed, the same shall constitute prima facie evidence that the debt or obligation and lien securing same is barred, and the owner or holder of such mortgage, lien or claim shall be estopped from asserting any rights thereunder in such suit.\n\nHistory:C.L. 1897, § 2685 (273), added by Laws 1907, ch. 107, § 1 (273); Code 1915, § 4387; Laws 1925, ch. 21, § 1; 1927, ch. 109, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 105-2001; Laws 1937, ch. 174, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 25-1301; Laws 1945, ch. 34, § 1; 1951, ch. 96, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 22-14-1.\n\nCross references.— For joinder of parties plaintiff,see42-6-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor state consent to be sued in quiet title actions,see42-6-12 to 42-6-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor tax assessment or payment in name of nonowner not cloud on title,see47-1-26 NMSA 1978.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nAfter-acquired title.— Where there are two chains of title from one initial grantor, the after-acquired title doctrine vests title in the first grantee whose chain of title began before the initial grantor obtained clear title and estops the second grantee whose chain of title began after the initial grantor obtained clear title and after the first grantee's chain of title began from claiming title to the land as against the first grantee.Rendleman v. Heinley, 2007-NMCA-009, 140 N.M. 912, 149 P.3d 1009.\n\nQuiet title action against one with deed, but questionable possession.— Where plaintiff had a deed to the land and actual possession of part of the land, giving plaintiff constructive possession of all of the land, and defendant had a deed to the land but did not have actual possession of the land and had done only irregular, occasional, and equivical acts to oust plaintiff, plaintiff was entitled to a decree quieting title to the land in plaintiff.Gentile v. Kennedy, 1896-NMSC-002, 8 N.M. 347, 45 P. 879 (decided under former law).\n\nEffect of unconfirmed land grant.— The owner of an interest in an unconfirmed Mexican or Spanish grant must first have the grant confirmed in order to bring suit to quiet title.Lockhart v. Leeds, 1900-NMSC-040, 10 N.M. 568, 63 P. 48,rev'd on other grounds, 195 U.S. 427, 25 S. Ct. 76, 49 L. Ed. 263 (1904) (decided under former law).\n\nPlaintiff's interest determined by instrument creating it.— The nature of a plaintiff's interest in a quiet title suit must be determined from the provisions of the instrument that created that interest.Christy v. Petrol Res. Corp., 1984-NMCA-108, 102 N.M. 58, 691 P.2d 59.\n\nSuit brought in U.S. court only in exceptional circumstances.— Where controversy was between two groups of cotenants, the appellees not having been ousted, could not maintain an action in ejectment and no plain, adequate and complete remedy at law being available, in exceptional circumstances of this kind where diversity of citizenship and jurisdictional amount are present, suit to quiet title may be brought in the United States court.Harlan v. Sparks, 125 F.2d 502 (10th Cir. 1942).\n\nThe rule under federal law that suits in equity shall not be sustained in a United States court where there is a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law has application even though the equity jurisdiction of state courts has been enlarged to provide that a suit to quiet title may be maintained against one in possession.Harlan v. Sparks, 125 F.2d 502 (10th Cir. 1942).\n\nSuit may be maintained in federal court under a state statute against an adverse claimant, when by the pleadings an adequate remedy at law is excluded.Baum v. Longwell, 200 F. 450 (D.N.M. 1912).\n\nWhen action not barred by laches.— An action to quiet title is not barred by laches when defendant (1) had knowledge plaintiff would assert right, since plaintiff's predecessor had informed defendant and his predecessors of encroachment and offered to lease the disputed area and (2) will not injure or prejudice the defendant.Thomas v. Pigman, 1967-NMSC-045, 77 N.M. 521, 424 P.2d 799.\n\nEffect of inserting name in deed on burden of proof.— Suit to quiet title to land held under a deed in which the grantee was not named, but whose name was later inserted, throws the burden upon the plaintiff of proving the instrument.Jones v. Rocky Cliff Coal Mining Co., 1921-NMSC-018, 27 N.M. 50, 198 P. 287.\n\nCourt will not disturb boundary finding when supported by evidence.— Where, in quiet title action, the court has considered all of the evidence before it and has determined the true location of the boundary, and the boundary is different from the one acquiesced in over the years, on review the court will not disturb such finding when supported by substantial evidence.Thomas v. Pigman, 1967-NMSC-045, 77 N.M. 521, 424 P.2d 799.\n\nII. INTEREST IN TITLE.\n\nQuiet title action brought by anyone, in or out of possession.— This section provides that an action to quiet title may be brought by anyone whether in or out of possession.Caranta v. Pioneer Home Improvements, Inc., 1970-NMSC-030, 81 N.M. 393, 467 P.2d 719 (1970).\n\nQuiet title action brought by anyone claiming interest.— Quiet title actions may be brought by anyone, in or out of possession, claiming an interest in real property.Currier v. Gonzales, 1967-NMSC-259, 78 N.M. 541, 434 P.2d 66;Pacheco v. Martinez, 1981-NMCA-116, 97 N.M. 37, 636 P.2d 308.\n\nThe action may be maintained by one out of possession against anyone claiming title, out of possession.Corman v. Cree, 100 F.2d 486 (10th Cir. 1938).\n\nAn action to determine and quiet title of real property may be brought by anyone having or claiming an interest therein whether in or out of possession of the same against any person claiming title thereto.Marques v. Maxwell Land Grant Co., 1904-NMSC-033, 12 N.M. 445, 78 P. 40.\n\nOne holding judgment lien on property may bring suit.Stanton v. Catron, 1896-NMSC-003, 8 N.M. 355, 45 P. 884 (decided under former law).\n\nProof of title basis of action.— Any person having or claiming an interest in real property, whether in or out of possession, may bring his bill to determine and quiet title against any person claiming title thereto, but proof of title has ever been the basis of this action.Stanton v. Catron, 1896-NMSC-003, 8 N.M. 355, 45 P. 884 (decided under former law).\n\nPossession under deed from grantor in possession is sufficient evidenceof title to maintain the action.Holthoff v. Freudenthal, 1916-NMSC-086, 22 N.M. 377, 162 P. 173.\n\nPlaintiff's recovery based upon strength of his title.— In a suit to quiet title the plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own title and not on the weakness of the title of his adversary.Cubero Land Grant v. DeSoto, 1966-NMSC-131, 76 N.M. 490, 416 P.2d 155;Esquibel v. Hallmark, 1978-NMSC-080, 92 N.M. 254, 586 P.2d 1083;Perea v. Martinez, 1980-NMSC-116, 95 N.M. 84, 619 P.2d 188.\n\nPlaintiff's recovery not based upon weakness of his adversary's claim.— A plaintiff in an action to quiet title to real estate must recover, if at all, upon the strength of his own title and not upon the weakness of his adversary's claim.Rock Island Oil & Ref. Co. v. Simmons, 1963-NMSC-192, 73 N.M. 142, 386 P.2d 239.\n\nPlaintiffs' prospects for recovery in a quiet title action must rest upon the strength of their own title and not upon the weakness of the defendants' claim.Lerma v. Romero, 1974-NMSC-089, 87 N.M. 3, 528 P.2d 647.\n\nInterest in title required.— The interest required by this section must be an interest in the title.Holthoff v. Freudenthal, 1916-NMSC-086, 22 N.M. 377, 162 P. 173.\n\nIII. SCOPE OF ACTION.\n\nAncillary issues not within the scope of the quiet title action.— Where the state filed a quiet title action to establish title to a road across private land to provide access to state lands; the private landowner claimed and offered evidence to prove that the true boundary line between the private land and the state land was not the long-accepted boundary line and that the road actually terminated on the private land, not on the state land; the boundary issue was not fully litigated in the district court, and potentially indispensable parties with an interest in title to the land affected by the private landowner's proposed boundary adjustment were not parties to the action. The only issue that the district court could decide was title to the road and access, not the issue of the location of the boundary.State ex. rel King v. UU Bar Ranch Ltd., 2009-NMSC-010, 145 N.M. 769, 205 P.3d 816,aff'g in part2005-NMCA-079, 137 N.M. 719, 114 P.3d 399.\n\nAction serves to remove cloud from title.— Title may be quieted against any person claiming title to lands in suit or lien thereon. A mortgage by force of statute is a cloud upon the title against which the decree will operate.State ex rel. Truitt v. District Court, 1939-NMSC-061, 44 N.M. 16, 96 P.2d 710.\n\nAction is not limited to removal of mere cloudson title. It embraces any claim of interest in land adverse to plaintiff.Corman v. Cree, 100 F.2d 486 (10th Cir. 1938).\n\nJudgment lien, although barred by statute of limitations, still cloud on title.— Even though a judgment lien has been barred by statute of limitations, it nevertheless remains a cloud upon the title and a party is entitled to seek a decree to discharge such cloud, this being especially true in view of this section.Pugh v. Heating & Plumbing Fin. Corp., 1945-NMSC-031, 49 N.M. 234, 161 P.2d 714.\n\nWhen quiet action suit improper remedy.— While the statute relative to actions to quiet title expressly provides that such action may be brought by a person either in or out of possession of the quieted premises, in the absence of the waiver, the defendant in possession of the premises is entitled as a matter of right to a jury trial, and thus, ejectment would be the proper remedy to be invoked in such a situation.Payne Land & Livestock Co. v. Archuleta, 180 F. Supp. 651 (D.N.M. 1960).\n\nForeclosure action and quiet title claim triable in single proceeding.— It would be logically inconsistent to hold that it is permissible to try both a foreclosure action and a quiet title claim in a single proceeding if both are asserted by the plaintiff, but it is not permissible to join them in one case if one is asserted by the plaintiff and the other arises in a defendant's counterclaim or cross-claim; this incongruous holding would be contrary to the purpose of Rule 13, N.M.R. Civ. P. (now Rule 1-013 NMRA).Ortega, Snead, Dixon & Hanna v. Gennitti, 1979-NMSC-056, 93 N.M. 135, 597 P.2d 745.\n\nQuiet title is not proper remedy for establishing trust in land.Petrakis v. Krasnow, 1949-NMSC-073, 54 N.M. 39, 213 P.2d 220.\n\nDamages are not recoverable in suit to quiet title.Chavez v. Gomez, 1967-NMSC-011, 77 N.M. 341, 423 P.2d 31.\n\nAttorney fees not recoverable in suit to quiet title.— In suit to quiet title, no damages or attorney's fees are allowable.Rosser v. Rosser, 1938-NMSC-026, 42 N.M. 360, 78 P.2d 1110.\n\nEquitable interest in real estate may be quietedbut the interest claimed must be an interest in the title.Rock Island Oil & Ref. Co. v. Simmons, 1963-NMSC-192, 73 N.M. 142, 386 P.2d 239.\n\nJudgment creditor or his assignee unable to maintain answer or counterclaim.— Neither a judgment creditor, nor his assignee, can maintain an answer or counterclaim in a suit to quiet title under this section and 42-6-2 NMSA 1978.Security Inv. & Dev. Co. v. Capital City Bank, 1917-NMSC-018, 22 N.M. 469, 164 P. 829.\n\nIV. PROCEEDINGS..\n\nVenue in county where property located.— Section 38-3-1D(1) NMSA 1978 is similar to the special venue provision contained in this section. Both permit an action concerning land to be brought in the county in which the land or any portion of it is located.Gonzales v. Gonzales, 1993-NMCA-159, 116 N.M. 838, 867 P.2d 1220.\n\nAction to quiet title to town land grant.— Where the board of trustees of a town land grant had the power to sue and be sued and held title to the land grant that was not subject to a trust for the benefit of the heirs of the land grant, the court held over the board of trustees to quiet title to the land grant in the purchaser of the land grant at a foreclosure sale and the heirs of the land grant were not necessary and indispensable parties.Shearton Development Co., L.L.C. v. Town of Chilili Land Grant, 2003-NMCA-120, 134 N.M. 444, 78 P.3d 525, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-001, 134 N.M. 611, 81 P.3d 554.\n\nIn quiet title action proper venue is jurisdictional.Pan Am. Petroleum Corp. v. Candelaria, 403 F.2d 351 (10th Cir. 1968) (decided under former law).\n\nCourt's jurisdiction limited to lands in county, prior to amendment.— A quiet title suit brought in 1947 affected interests in land located in two counties. The statute then in effect § 25-1301, 1941 Comp., made no provision for bringing suit in one county covering land in another. The district court's jurisdiction was thus limited to lands in the county where the action was brought.Pan Am. Petroleum Corp. v. Candelaria, 403 F.2d 351 (10th Cir. 1968) (decided under former law).\n\nService of process.— Service may not be by publication upon \"unknown owners\" if the plaintiffs have knowledge or the means of knowledge as to persons in actual adverse possession.Pankey v. Ortiz, 1921-NMSC-007, 26 N.M. 575, 195 P. 906;Priest v. Trustees of Town of Las Vegas, 232 U.S. 604, 34 S. Ct. 443, 58 L. Ed. 751 (1914),aff'g1911-NMSC-072, 16 N.M. 692, 120 P. 894.\n\nConstructive service proper where names and addresses of defendants are not reasonably ascertainable.— In a collateral attack on a 1948 quiet title judgment in San Juan county, in which service of process was accomplished by publication in a weekly newspaper, and where the plaintiffs in the 1948 complaint alleged that after diligent search and inquiry, they had been unable to learn or determine the names, places of residence, addresses and whereabouts of any unknown heirs of any deceased defendants or if any defendants were still living and residing in New Mexico, they could not be located because they had secreted themselves so that personal service of process could not be effected, and where the return of service completed by the sheriff of San Juan county indicated that after diligent search and inquiry, any predecessors-in-interest could not be located and personally served with process, the district court correctly found that the suit in this case constituted an improper collateral attack on the 1948 judgment quieting title in defendants' predecessors-in-interest, because constructive notice given in the underlying case was sufficiently reasonably calculated under the circumstances as they existed in 1948; constructive service of process by publication satisfies due process if the names and addresses of the defendants to be served are not reasonably ascertainable.T.H. McElvain Oil & Gas Ltd. P'ship v. Benson-Montin-Greer Drilling Corp., 2017-NMSC-004,rev'g2015-NMCA-004, 340 P.3d 1277.\n\nNotice must comport with due process.— In order to comport with due process, quiet title plaintiffs must undertake a diligent and good faith effort to personally serve the necessary parties with process before attempting to serve process by constructive notice, which is not favored and is permissible only out of necessity.T.H. McElvain Oil & Gas Ltd. P'ship v. Benson-Montin-Greer Drilling Corp., 2015-NMCA-004, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-012.\n\nEquitable principles in quiet title action.— In quiet title action, where the evidence was insufficient to show that the complaining party was given sufficient notice that they were entitled to enforce their ownership rights, but delayed in asserting their rights or neglected to do so, the district court erred in granting summary judgment based on equitable principles of laches, waiver and judicial estoppel.T.H. McElvain Oil & Gas Ltd. P'ship v. Benson-Montin-Greer Drilling Corp., 2015-NMCA-004, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-012.\n\nWhere judgment quieting title to property improper.— In quiet title action, plaintiffs' constructive service upon defendants, who had an ownership interest in the property, failed to comply with due process, and therefore, quiet title action was void as to defendants, where plaintiffs failed to undertake a diligent and good faith effort to personally serve defendants by failing to either investigate evidence of the defendants' location as required, or to fully apprise the district court of the defendants' state of residence which was revealed during transactions involving the property.T.H. McElvain Oil & Gas Ltd. P'ship v. Benson-Montin-Greer Drilling Corp., 2015-NMCA-004, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-012.\n\nSuit to cancel mortgage deed requires personal service.— A suit to cancel a mortgage deed is a proceedings in personam and not in rem, and required personal service of process within the state.Rosser v. Rosser, 1938-NMSC-026, 42 N.M. 360, 78 P.2d 1110.\n\nAll parties in possession not indispensable.— In a quiet title suit, owners of some of the property bordering on a right-of-way are proper but not indispensable parties in suit by party claiming title to part of property held by other parties. All parties in possession need not be joined.Alston v. Clinton, 1963-NMSC-227, 73 N.M. 341, 388 P.2d 64.\n\nWhere joinder of defendants defeats court's jurisdiction.— A court having equitable powers cannot take jurisdiction in suit by one plaintiff against several defendants, to prevent multiplicity of suits, when the defendants have nothing in common except their source of color of title, and each defendant has a distinct, different, and separate defense.Pankey v. Ortiz, 1921-NMSC-007, 26 N.M. 575, 195 P. 906.\n\nContents of complaint.— Even after a severance has occurred, a complaint in a quiet title suit describing the property and alleging a fee simple ownership is equivalent to a claim of ownership of the fee in the surface and in the minerals. If a plaintiff's claim is solely to the surface estate, then his complaint should so state. If his claim is solely to the mineral estate, then his complaint should so state.Kaye v. Cooper Grocery Co., 1957-NMSC-049, 63 N.M. 36, 312 P.2d 798.\n\nComplaint cannot be dismissed on ground that equities cannot be adjudicatedin a quiet title action where a title holder in possession brings the suit to remove clouds caused by mechanics' liens.Petrakis v. Krasnow, 1949-NMSC-073, 54 N.M. 39, 213 P.2d 220.\n\nSection not at variance with Rule 1-013 NMRA.— There is nothing specific nor inherent in this section at variance with the unrestrictive counterclaim provisions of Rule 1-013 NMRA.Ortega, Snead, Dixon & Hanna v. Gennitti, 1979-NMSC-056, 93 N.M. 135, 597 P.2d 745.\n\nRight to jury trial dependent upon possession.— In an action to quiet title, no right to jury trial exists where neither party is in possession or the moving party is in possession.Baca v. Anaya, 1908-NMSC-009, 14 N.M. 382, 94 P. 1017.\n\nFiling of counterclaim waives defendant's right to jury trial.— A defendant is deemed as having waived his right to jury trial, even though ejectment would have been plaintiff's proper remedy instead of suit to quiet title, where defendant filed a counterclaim to quiet title or asks for other equitable relief.Quintana v. Vigil, 1942-NMSC-018, 46 N.M. 200, 125 P.2d 711,overruled byEvans Fin. Corp. v. Strasser, 1983-NMSC-053, 99 N.M. 788, 664 P.2d 986.\n\nJudgment self-operating and establishes interest.— The action to quiet title is a substantive adjudication of title. The judgment is self-operating. By the judgment itself the interest is established. In such an action all matters affecting the title of the parties to the action may be litigated and determined, and the judgment therein is final and conclusive.Kaye v. Cooper Grocery Co., 1957-NMSC-049, 63 N.M. 36, 312 P.2d 798.\n\nWhere judgment for husband and wife coplaintiffs does not give him estate.— Where title to property was conveyed to wife by her husband, and although wife did not thereafter reconvey any interest to her husband, husband joined with wife as plaintiff in bringing suit to quiet title on property standing in her name, and title to the property was quieted in the two of them, husband did not as a result of such judgment alone acquire any interest in the property and children of husband therefore did not have an interest in the property under the laws of descent and distribution following death of husband intestate.Saiz v. Saiz, 1964-NMSC-229, 74 N.M. 557, 395 P.2d 907.\n\nDefault judgment not set aside by subsequent suit.— A default judgment in a suit to quiet title, in which the plaintiff's right and title were based upon a tax deed, invalid because the taxes for which it was issued had been paid, cannot, in the absence of fraud, be set aside by a subsequent suit for that purpose, the doctrine of res judicata being applicable.Bowers v. Brazell, 1922-NMSC-014, 27 N.M. 685, 205 P. 715 (decided under former law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part II,\" see 2 Nat. Resources J. 75 (1962).\n\nTrujillo v.

      "text": "The plaintiff must file his complaint in the district court, setting forth the nature and extent of his estate and describing the premises as accurately as may be, and averring that he is credibly informed and believes that the defendant makes some claim adverse to the estate of the plaintiff, and praying for the establishment of the plaintiff's estate against such adverse claims, and that the defendant be barred and forever estopped from having or claiming any lien upon or any right or title to the premises, adverse to the plaintiff, and that plaintiff's title thereto be forever quieted and set at rest. Any or all persons whom the plaintiff alleges in his complaint he is informed and believes make claim adverse to the estate of the plaintiff, the unknown heirs of any deceased person whom plaintiff alleges in his complaint in his lifetime made claim adverse to the estate of the plaintiff, and all unknown persons claiming any lien, interest or title adverse to plaintiff, may be made parties defendant to said complaint by their names, as near as the same can be ascertained, such unknown heirs by the style of unknown heirs of such deceased person, and said unknown persons who may claim any lien, interest or title adverse to the plaintiff, by the name and style of unknown claimants of interest in the premises adverse to the plaintiff. When the plaintiff shall allege generally in his complaint that he has made due search and inquiry to ascertain whether any person whom he desires to name as party defendant in said cause is living or dead and is unable to ascertain with certainty whether such person is living or dead, such person and his unknown heirs may be made parties defendant to said complaint under the name and style of \"(name of the party), if living, if deceased, the unknown heirs of (name of the party), deceased.\" Service of process and notice of said suit against all of such defendants shall be made as in other cases in conformity with the provisions of law and rules of court relating to the service of process.\n\nHistory:Trial Court Rule 105-2002; 1941 Comp., § 25-1302; 1953 Comp., § 22-14-2; Laws 1973, ch. 199, § 1; 1977, ch. 150, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Trial Court Rule 105-2002 as amended supersedes Comp. Stat. 1929, § 105-2002 (C.L. 1897, § 2685(274), as added by Laws 1907, ch. 107, § 1(274); Code 1915, § 4388; Laws 1925, ch. 21, § 2, p. 32), as amended by Laws 1937, ch. 132, § 1, p. 387, and is identical therewith. The 1925 amendment of the statute added the provisions concerning liens. The 1937 amendment to the statute added the third sentence and changed the fourth sentence which previously provided that service should be made under the Code of Civil Procedure. In 1973 the legislature enacted Trial Court Rule 105-2002 as Section 22-14-2 NMSA 1953.\n\nCross references.— For real property descriptions in pleading,see47-1-46 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor service of process,seeRule 1-004 NMRA.\n\nThe 1977 amendment,effective April 1, 1977, deleted former Subsection B, relating to joinder of and service on spouses of defendants, and deleted the designation of the remainder of this section as Subsection A.\n\nComplaint must recite facts sufficient to state cause of action.— A complaint which states that \"the plaintiff by virtue of diverse deeds of conveyance, etc., from the grant of the Colony of Refugio and of long and continuous adverse possession under color of title, etc., are the owners in fee simple of the property described\" is insufficient. It fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Oliver v. Enriquez, 1912-NMSC-022, 17 N.M. 206, 124 P. 798.\n\nUse of statutory language in complaint, proper.— A complaint to quiet title to real estate in the language of the statute is sufficient.Lamport v. Tidwell, 1937-NMSC-093, 42 N.M. 12, 74 P.2d 69;Knabel v. Escudero, 1927-NMSC-032, 32 N.M. 311, 255 P. 633.\n\nFacts as to derivation of title not required.— Laws 1907, ch. 107, § 1 (274) Comp. Stat. 1929, § 105-2002, did not require a party to set forth any facts, as to the derivation of his title, but simply required a statement of the ultimate fact as to his ownership, and the interest he claimed.Oliver v. Enriquez, 1912-NMSC-022, 17 N.M. 206, 124 P. 798.\n\nComplaint against assignee of tax sale certificate sufficient for quiet title.— Complaint against assignee of tax sale certificate seeking cancelation of the certificate was sufficient as complaint to quiet title.Lamport v. Tidwell, 1937-NMSC-093, 42 N.M. 12, 74 P.2d 69.\n\nEffect of omission of adverse possession claim is complaint.— Where complaint to quiet title was in the form prescribed by this section, without making mention of the fact plaintiff claimed title by adverse possession under the quitclaim deed the trial court did not err in permitting proof of adverse possession under such complaint.Lummus v. Brackin, 1955-NMSC-023, 59 N.M. 216, 281 P.2d 928.\n\nUnnecessary to repeat \"unknown heirs of\" before each individual name.— It is sufficient to use the following form to designate unknown heirs: \"Unknown heirs of the following named deceased persons\" followed by the names of any and all deceased persons whose unknown heirs are desired to be served and it is unnecessary to repeat the words \"unknown heirs of\" before each individual name.Thomas v. Meyers, 1948-NMSC-025, 52 N.M. 164, 193 P.2d 624.\n\nProving estoppel.— Facts which establish estoppel in pais must ordinarily be pleaded, but this need not be done in suit to quiet title where the plaintiff does not set forth nor plead his precise claim of title, in which case estoppel may be proved under the general issue.Hoskins v. Talley, 1923-NMSC-085, 29 N.M. 173, 220 P. 1007.\n\nNeither judgment creditor, nor his assignee, can answer or counterclaimin a suit to quiet title.Security Inv. & Dev. Co. v. Capital City Bank, 1917-NMSC-018, 22 N.M. 469, 164 P. 829.\n\nImproper name of party renders action defective.— Action to quiet title to land within boundaries of land grant to town of Las Vegas, brought under Comp. Laws 1897, §§ 4010, 4011, was defective where town of Las Vegas was not made a party by its proper name.Priest v. Trustees of Town of Las Vegas, 232 U.S. 604, 34 S. Ct. 443, 58 L. Ed. 751 (1914).\n\nEffect of civil rule on joinder.— Joinder of a person in possession or of one whose interest may be ascertained by ordinary diligence and inquiry so as to make possible a joinder by name, cannot be accomplished by joinder under the designation of \"unknown claimant,\" in view of Rule 1-004 K(4) NMRA.Murray Hotel Co. v. Golding, 1950-NMSC-014, 54 N.M. 149, 216 P.2d 364.\n\nProvisions for service of process strictly construed.— Provisions for the service of process upon unknown claimants by publication in actions to quiet title will be strictly construed.Priest v. Board of Trustees, 1911-NMSC-072, 16 N.M. 692, 120 P. 894,aff'd, 232 U.S. 604, 34 S. Ct. 443, 58 L. Ed. 751 (1914).\n\nConstructive service proper where names and addresses of defendants are not reasonably ascertainable.— In a collateral attack on a 1948 quiet title judgment in San Juan county, in which service of process was accomplished by publication in a weekly newspaper, and where the plaintiffs in the 1948 complaint alleged that after diligent search and inquiry, they had been unable to learn or determine the names, places of residence, addresses and whereabouts of any unknown heirs of any deceased defendants or if any defendants were still living and residing in New Mexico, they could not be located because they had secreted themselves so that personal service of process could not be effected, and where the return of service completed by the sheriff of San Juan county indicated that after diligent search and inquiry, any predecessors-in-interest could not be located and personally served with process, the district court correctly found that the suit in this case constituted an improper collateral attack on the 1948 judgment quieting title in defendants' predecessors-in-interest, because constructive notice given in the underlying case was sufficiently reasonably calculated under the circumstances as they existed in 1948; constructive service of process by publication satisfies due process if the names and addresses of the defendants to be served are not reasonably ascertainable.T.H. McElvain Oil & Gas Ltd. P'ship v. Benson-Montin-Greer Drilling Corp., 2017-NMSC-004,rev'g2015-NMCA-004, 340 P.3d 1277.\n\nNotice must comport with due process.— In order to comport with due process, quiet title plaintiffs must undertake a diligent and good faith effort to personally serve the necessary parties with process before attempting to serve process by constructive notice, which is not favored and is permissible only out of necessity.T.H. McElvain Oil & Gas Ltd. P'ship v. Benson-Montin-Greer Drilling Corp., 2015-NMCA-004, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-012.\n\nEquitable principles in quiet title action.— In quiet title action, where the evidence was insufficient to show that the complaining party was given sufficient notice that they were entitled to enforce their ownership rights, but delayed in asserting their rights or neglected to do so, the district court erred in granting summary judgment based on equitable principles of laches, waiver and judicial estoppel.T.H. McElvain Oil & Gas Ltd. P'ship v. Benson-Montin-Greer Drilling Corp., 2015-NMCA-004, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-012.\n\nWhere judgment quieting title to property improper.— In quiet title action, plaintiffs' constructive service upon defendants, who had an ownership interest in the property, failed to comply with due process, and therefore, quiet title action was void as to defendants, where plaintiffs failed to undertake a diligent and good faith effort to personally serve defendants by failing to either investigate evidence of the defendants' location as required, or to fully apprise the district court of the defendants' state of residence which was revealed during transactions involving the property.T.H.

      "text": "Upon the conditions herein prescribed for the protection of the state of New Mexico, the consent of the state is given to be named a party in any suit which is now pending or which may hereafter be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction of the state to quiet title to or for the foreclosure of a mortgage or other lien upon real estate or personal property, for the purpose of securing an adjudication touching any mortgage or other lien the state may have or claim on the premises or personal property involved.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 25-1312, enacted by Laws 1947, ch. 150, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 22-14-12.\n\nPurpose of section.— This section was enacted for the limited purpose of aiding a mortgagee who discovers that the state has acquired an interest in the mortgaged property and is unable to pass a marketable title to the purchaser at a foreclosure sale unless the state can be joined in the foreclosure suit.Maes v. Old Lincoln Cnty. Mem. Comm'n, 1958-NMSC-115, 64 N.M. 475, 330 P.2d 556.\n\nNo omnibus legislative consent to sue state.— The supreme court finds no omnibus legislative consent to bring suit against the state to quiet title.Maes v. Old Lincoln Cnty. Mem. Comm'n, 1958-NMSC-115, 64 N.M. 475, 330 P.2d 556.\n\nLimited waiver of immunity does not include actions to quiet title.— In consolidated cases where plaintiffs filed complaints to quiet title to real property, and named defendants, each a political subdivision of the state, as parties who may claim an adverse interest in the respective properties, and where defendants filed motions to dismiss, claiming that 42-11-1 NMSA 1978 prohibited naming defendants as parties in an action to quiet title because they were political subdivisions of the state, the court of appeals properly ordered dismissal of the actions, because in enacting 42-11-1 NMSA 1978, the legislature intended to grant broad immunity to the state and its political subdivisions, and although this section provides a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, it does not include actions to quiet title.Nash v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs of Catron Cnty., 2021-NMSC-005,aff'g2019-NMCA-044.\n\nWaiver of immunity does not authorize quiet title suits under the circumstances of this case.— Where, in two separate quiet title lawsuits, plaintiffs named the county of Valencia and the board of county commissioners of Catron county as parties who claimed or may claim an interest in the subject properties, and where the counties responded by filing motions to dismiss on the ground that 42-11-1 NMSA 1978 provided them with immunity and barred the lawsuits, the New Mexico court of appeals held that 42-11-1 NMSA 1978 controls and acts as a bar to quiet title suits against the state and its political subdivisions unless specifically authorized by law, and that this section's limited purpose of aiding a mortgagee where the state has acquired an interest in the mortgaged property and the mortgagee is unable to pass marketable title to the purchaser at a foreclosure sale unless the state can be joined in the foreclosure suit does not provide a statutory exception to the counties' immunity.Belen Consol. Sch. Dist. v. Valencia Cty. and Nash v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, 2019-NMCA-044, cert. granted.\n\nSection does not statutorily create sovereign immunityin quiet title actions against the state, as there are presently in New Mexico no conditions or circumstances that could rationally support the doctrine of sovereign immunity.Brosseau v.
