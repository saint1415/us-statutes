      "text": "The action of ejectment may be maintained in all cases where the plaintiff is legally entitled to the possession of the premises.\n\nHistory:C.L. 1897, § 2685 (250), added by Laws 1907, ch. 107, § 1 (250); Code 1915, § 4360; C.S. 1929, § 105-1801; 1941 Comp., § 25-801; 1953 Comp., § 22-8-1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For forcible entry and detainer suits in district courts,see35-10-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor action of ejectment against persons claiming community land grants improperly,see49-2-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nLandlord's right to possession of premises core of action.— The very foundation of the right to maintain an action of ejectment, both at the common law and under the territorial statute, is the landlord's right to the possession of the premises.Osborne v. United States, 1885-NMSC-010, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 337, 5 P. 465 (decided under former law).\n\nRight to possession.— In ejectment, the parties' rights to possession are primarily in issue.Pacheco v. Martinez, 1981-NMCA-116, 97 N.M. 37, 636 P.2d 308.\n\nRight to possession at time of filing complaint essential.— A right to possession of the premises at the time of filing the complaint is essential to maintaining ejectment both at common law and under the statutory law of New Mexico.Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Bokum Corp., 453 F.2d 1067 (10th Cir. 1972).\n\nAdverse possessor maintaining ejectment action.— The fact that grantee's spouse, who claimed land on theory of adverse possession, had not been in actual possession of all of land in question did not defeat grantee's spouse's right to possession of entire tract where possession was based on quiet title decree describing entire tract.Quintana v. Montoya, 1958-NMSC-075, 64 N.M. 464, 330 P.2d 549.\n\nDetermination of better title between parties.— In ejectment, where no legal title is shown in either party, the party showing prior possession in himself, or those through whom he claims, will be held to have the better title.Romero v. Herrera, 1921-NMSC-096, 27 N.M. 559, 203 P. 243;Blea v. Sandoval, 1988-NMCA-036, 107 N.M. 554, 761 P.2d 432, cert. denied 107 N.M. 413, 759 P.2d 200.\n\nEjectment on superior title is a breach of the warranty of good title.Garcia v. Herrera, 1998-NMCA-066, 125 N.M. 199, 959 P.2d 533, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 145, 958 P.2d 103.\n\nRemedy for breach of covenant not in ejectment.— In absence of an express forfeiture provision in a lease, the lessor's remedy for breach of covenants, express or implied, is an action for damages or a suit in equity for cancellation, and not an action at law for ejectment.Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Bokum Corp., 453 F.2d 1067 (10th Cir. 1972).\n\nJoinder of causes of action.— Both legal and equitable remedies are administered by a single court as two complementary departments of jurisprudence so that there is no error by a joinder of the causes of action. Therefore, plaintiff has the right to bring a suit in ejectment and to request a prayer for relief and defendant can counterclaim in a suit to quiet title.Martinez v. Mundy, 1956-NMSC-037, 61 N.M. 87, 295 P.2d 209,overruled on other grounds byEvans Fin. Corp. v. Strasser, 1983-NMSC-053, 99 N.M. 788, 664 P.2d 986.\n\nBurden of proof.— In action of ejectment, plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own title, and where the grant to him contains an exception or reservation, he must show that the land in controversy was not reserved.Maxwell Land Grant Co. v. Dawson, 1893-NMSC-014, 7 N.M. 133, 34 P. 191,rev'd on other grounds, 151 U.S. 586, 14 S. Ct. 458, 38 L. Ed. 279 (1894) (decided under former law).\n\nJury not restricted to technical definition in boundary dispute.— Where in an action in ejectment the boundaries were in dispute and the term \"las lomas,\" the hills, was used in the deed to designate the termination of the property, it was error for the court to limit the jury to a technical definition and to exclude from their consideration parol evidence of local distinctions between \"altidos,\" little hills, \"matoral,\" sand hills around bushes, \"lomitas,\" groups of hills, and \"las lomas\" or hills of considerable height, since \"las lomas\" constituted a latent ambiguity and was subject to explanation by parol.Gentile v. Crossan, 1894-NMSC-013, 7 N.M. 589, 38 P. 247 (decided under former law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part II,\" see 2 Nat. Resources J. 75 (1962).\n\nFor survey, \"The Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act,\" see 6 N.M. L. Rev. 293 (1976).\n\nFor article, \"Survey of New Mexico Law, 1982-83: Property Law,\" see 14 N.M.L.

      "text": "The action of ejectment will lie for the recovery of the possession of a mining claim, as well also of any real estate, where the party suing has been wrongfully ousted from the possession thereof, and the possession wrongfully detained.\n\nHistory:C.L. 1897, § 2685 (251), added by Laws 1907, ch. 107, § 1 (251); Code 1915, § 4361; C.S. 1929, § 105-1802; 1941 Comp., § 25-802; 1953 Comp., § 22-8-2.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCourt considers strength of possessory title of parties.— In this sort of possessory action, it is the duty of the court to consider the strength of the possessory title of each of the adversary parties. Winslow v. Burns, 47 N.M. 29, 132 P.2d 1048 (1943).\n\nPriority of rights between locators.— As between the prior locator in possession and a subsequent locator, the evidence of the prior locator will be viewed in the most favorable light it will reasonably justify. Winslow v. Burns, 47 N.M. 29, 132 P.2d 1048 (1943).\n\nTrespasser in possession may maintain action against second trespasser.— One in possession of the surface of a mining claim, even though a trespasser, may maintain ejectment against one who trespasses underneath the surface. Lincoln-Lucky & Lee Mining Co. v. Hendry, 9 N.M. 149, 50 P. 330 (1897) (decided under former law).\n\nRecovery of government land by plaintiff without title.— Plaintiff with prior actual possession without title of government land may recover its possession by ejectment on a proper demand for restoration of such possession against a subsequent mere intruder, for the statute is broad enough to include possession wholly disconnected from the legal or even colorable title, and while such actual possession although continued indefinitely would not ripen into a legal title or constitute an equity against the United States, it will be protected against such wrongdoer. N. M., Rio Grande & Pac. Ry. v. Crouch, 4 N.M. (Gild.) 293, 13 P. 201 (1887) (decided under former law).\n\nWhen distinction between ouster upon and beneath surface.— There can be no distinction between an ouster upon the surface and an ouster beneath the surface in an action of ejectment on a mining claim, except in cases arising under the mining laws by virtue of this statute, for the rule is the same as to all character of lands. Lincoln-Lucky & Lee Mining Co. v. Hendry, 9 N.M. 149, 50 P. 330 (1897) (decided under former law).\n\nBurden of proof.— In action in ejectment for possession of a mine claimed by plaintiff under United States patent, where plaintiff made prima facie case, and defendant undertook to establish fact that by virtue of certain act of congress, which contemplated certain state of facts and a strict compliance with the provisions and conditions of the same, they were given right to follow mineral vein or lode from or across side lines of claims, the burden of proof as to the existence of such state of facts, and the compliance with all the requirements, conditions and terms of the act, was upon defendant. Bell v. Skillicorn, 6 N.M. 399, 28 P. 768 (1892) (decided under former law).\n\nModel used during trial, allowed in jury room.— Where miners who had worked on the property in question made a model, which they admitted was not a perfect facsimile of the mine, and the court refused to admit it as such, but did admit it for the purpose of explaining the testimony of witnesses, and several used it for both plaintiff and defendant, it was proper to permit the jury to take it to the jury room at their request. Illinois Silver Mining & Milling Co. v. Raff, 7 N.M. 336, 34 P. 544 (1893) (decided under former law).\n\nInstructions to jury.— In action in ejectment for possession of a mine claimed by plaintiff under United States patent, which was in evidence, court properly instructed jury that if plaintiff's vein was within side lines formed by artificial monuments placed around the same at time of survey for patent, it would make no difference whether said monuments and survey were properly connected with the surveys of the public lands, but that the locations of said monuments would determine and control the location. Bell v. Skillicorn, 6 N.M. 399, 28 P. 768 (1892) (decided under former law).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —25 Am. Jur. 2d Ejectment §§ 5, 20, 21, 22; 54 Am.

As used there, they referred to art. 14 of Laws 1907, ch. 107, compiled as 42-4-1 to 42-4-16 NMSA 1978. This section is part of art. 18 of ch. 88 of the 1915 Code, which is compiled as 42-4-1 to 42-4-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nJoinder of causes of action.— Where appellee's amended complaint first alleged that she was the owner and entitled to possession of the land involved, then alleged that appellants constructed two houses and utility lines in such a manner as to encroach on her property to her damage, and that appellants should be required to remove the encroachments, appellee's amended complaint is that type of alternative pleading which is permissible under Rule 8(a)(2), N.M.R. Civ. P. (now Rule 1-008 NMRA). As both legal and equitable remedies are administered by a single court, there was no error by a joinder of the causes of action.Heaton v. Miller, 1964-NMSC-080, 74 N.M. 148, 391 P.2d 653.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —25 Am. Jur. 2d Ejectment §§ 1, 18, 32, 44.\n\n28A C.J.S. Ejectment § 60.",

Latin Am. Council of Christian Churches v. Leal, 57 N.M. 502, 260 P.2d 697 (1953).\n\nOne in actual occupation, necessary and proper defendant.— Generally, in an ejectment action the person in actual occupation or possession is a necessary and proper defendant, and no other person is a necessary or proper party defendant. Latin Am. Council of Christian Churches v. Leal, 57 N.M. 502, 260 P.2d 697 (1953).\n\nAction of ejectment against cotenant.— Ejectment lies against a cotenant, or a grantee of a cotenant, attempting to hold adversely to his cotenant. Prior possession, under such circumstances, is sufficient to maintain ejectment. Lasswell v. Kitt, 11 N.M. 459, 70 P. 561 (1902); Lockhart v. Leeds, 10 N.M. 568, 63 P. 48 (1900), rev'd on other grounds, 195 U.S. 427, 25 S. Ct. 76, 49 L.

Permian Ford-Lincoln-Mercury, 1981-NMSC-001, 95 N.M. 314, 621 P.2d 1119.\n\nRight to possession.— In ejectment, the parties' rights to possession are primarily in issue.Pacheco v. Martinez, 1981-NMCA-116, 97 N.M. 37, 636 P.2d 308.\n\nRight to possession at time of filing complaint essential.— Plaintiff's failure to give his month-to-month tenant valid 30-days' notice meant that plaintiff's complaint in ejectment was invalid, because he did not have the right to possession; his action in ejectment was, therefore, premature.Dickens v. Hall, 1986-NMSC-029, 104 N.M. 173, 718 P.2d 683.\n\nDefective deed alone will not support summary determination.— Where plaintiffs in ejectment action have shown that the deed upon which defendants' title is asserted is fatally defective, this alone will not support a summary determination of the cause where there are indications external to the deed which might support defendants' position.Jemez Props., Inc. v. Lucero, 1979-NMCA-162, 94 N.M. 181, 608 P.2d 157, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 628, 614 P.2d 545 (1980).\n\nEffect of conflicting calls in deed, in boundary line dispute.— In an action instituted by appellee who filed a complaint in the nature of ejectment in a boundary line dispute, when there are conflicting calls in a deed - one for distance, the other for an adjoining tract of a named person - the latter prevails only if the person named actually owns the adjoining tract.Olivas v. Garcia, 1958-NMSC-105, 64 N.M. 419, 329 P.2d 435.\n\nNo directed verdict where conflict in evidence as to possession.— Where neither party to an action in ejectment shows legal title in himself, and the prior possession of the plaintiff and those through whom he claims as a matter upon which there is a conflict in the evidence, the court cannot properly direct a verdict, but the case should be submitted to the jury.Romero v.
