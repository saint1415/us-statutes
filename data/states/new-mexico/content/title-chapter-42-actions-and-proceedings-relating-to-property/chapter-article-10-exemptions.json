Muse, 2009-NMCA-003, 145 N.M. 451, 200 P.3d 104.\n\nConstitutionality.— The postjudgment execution statutes are unconstitutional as not providing adequate notice of allowable exemptions and the right to a hearing.Aacen v. San Juan Cnty. Sheriff's Dep't, 944 F.2d 691 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\nPurpose of exemption statutes.— The exemption statutes were designed to protect debtors from becoming destitute as a consequence of unforseeable indebtedness, but it was never suggested that such statutes be construed to deprive an individual of his rights of ownership in the exempt property. If the law permits a person to sell his exempt property, surely it permits the less drastic step of encumbering it.Hernandez v. S.I.C. Fin. Co., 1968-NMSC-192, 79 N.M. 673, 448 P.2d 474.\n\nSection construed.— This section, which applies to debtors who support others, includes married persons or heads of household, even if the individual married debtor stays at home and does not earn any income, and even if the individual single debtor who has a dependent earns insufficient income to pay for the household expenses.In re Bushey, 559 B.R. 766 (Bankr. D. N.M. 2016).\n\nFull or complete support is not required.— Where debtor filed a voluntary petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C.), and where creditors asserted debtor could not claim exemptions under this section because he was not married to his live-in girlfriend who paid for the majority of the household expenses, debtor was not entitled to claim exemptions under this section because his contributions to the household expenses was less than one-half of the couple's total household expenses and he therefore did not support another person. There is, however, no language in this statute that requires full or complete support as a condition to being able to claim the exemption.In re Bushey, 559 B.R. 766 (Bankr. D. N.M. 2016).\n\nSupport of debtor's family, intent of section.— Laws 1887, ch. 73, this section prior to amendment, was not intended to encourage extravagance and the evasion of just debts, but for the necessary support of the debtor's family and himself.N.M. Nat'l Bank v. Brooks, 1897-NMSC-015, 9 N.M. 113, 49 P. 947 (decided under former law).\n\nExemption may be claimed out of wageswhich have been garnished in lieu of a homestead.McFadden v. Murray, 1927-NMSC-039, 32 N.M. 361, 257 P. 999 (decided under former law).\n\nAmendment of schedules of exempt property.— Debtors may amend their schedules listing exempt property at any time prior to the closing of a bankruptcy case, subject to objections filed by any party adversely affected by the amendment.In re Vest, 18 Bankr. 241 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1982).\n\nProperty interest in exempt property.— By creating exemptions from execution, New Mexico granted judgment debtors a property interest in retaining their exempt property, which is entitled to due process protection.Aacen v. San Juan Cnty. Sheriff's Dep't, 944 F.2d 691 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\nNo right of setoff.— A bank may not exercise its right of setoff against debtors' funds that constitute exempt property under former 11 U.S.C. § 522 and this section.In re Wilde, 85 Bankr. 147 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1988).\n\nExemptions not available for child support liens.— Statutory exemptions for debtors in foreclosure actions set forth in this article are unavailable to a parent as against a lien for child support obligations under 40-4-15 NMSA 1978.D'Avignon v. Graham, 1991-NMCA-125, 113 N.M. 129, 823 P.2d 929.\n\nNo exemption for tools of a spouse's trade.— This section does not include language that would permit a debtor to claim a tools of the trade exemption for tools of a spouse's trade.In re Bryan, 126 Bankr. 108 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1991).\n\nDoctor's spouse was not allowed an exemption for medical equipment as tools of the trade where she was not engaged in the trade of medicine.In re Bryan, 126 Bankr. 108 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1991).\n\nStacking motor vehicle exemptions.— The plain language of this section permits each debtor to exempt $4,000.00 worth of equity in a single motor vehicle. The only apparent limiting language, other than the maximum $4,000.00 exemption, is that a debtor is precluded from exempting equity in more than one car. Nothing in the statute prevents debtors from stacking their motor vehicle exemptions in the same vehicle.Jones v. Boyd, 134 Bankr. 431 (D.N.M. 1991).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part I,\" see 1 Nat.

Gengler, 2012-NMCA-093, 287 P.3d 350, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-007.\n\nThe exemption does not apply to attorney-fee contracts.— Where an insured retained an attorney pursuant to a contingent fee agreement to recover insurance proceeds under an accidental death and dismemberment policy, the insurer paid the insured's claim; and the contingent fee agreement did not contain a specific assignment by the insured of recovered insurance proceeds to the attorney, the attorney was entitled to recover the contingent fee pursuant to the contingent fee agreement because Section 42-10-3 NMSA 1978 did not apply to the contingent fee agreement.Will Ferguson & Assoc., Inc. v. Gengler, 2012-NMCA-093, 287 P.3d 350, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-007.\n\nConstruction of section.— The language of this section is broad and expansive. It does not limit the type of payment, form of payment, or person to receive the payment.Finch v. Schrock, 119 Bankr. 808 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1990).\n\nPayment of a policy's premiums by a third party.— Where debtor filed a voluntary petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C.), and where creditors contested whether debtor owned a life insurance policy based on the parties' stipulation that a third party paid the majority of the premiums for the policy, debtor was entitled to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policy, because payment of a policy's premiums by a party other than the owner does not effectuate a change in ownership of the policy.In re Bushey, 559 B.R. 766 (Bankr. D. N.M. 2016).\n\nWaiver of exemption.— Where parties to a divorce action entered into a marital settlement agreement in which they placed an annuity, money purchase plan, profit sharing plan, and individual retirement accounts under the control of a receiver to pay personal taxes and community debts, the parties waived the statutory exemption.Gordon v. Gordon, 2011-NMCA-044, 149 N.M. 783, 255 P.3d 361.\n\nUnlimited exemptions allowed as to insurance.— The New Mexico statutes permit unlimited exemptions in bankruptcy proceedings with respect to insurance, and with respect to pension and retirement plans.Albuquerque Nat'l Bank v. Zouhar, 10 Bankr. 154 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1981).\n\nExemption by person not a beneficiary.— Debtor could exempt insurance proceeds he was to receive as an heir of his parents' probate estate even though he was not a named beneficiary on the policies.Finch v. Schrock, 119 Bankr. 808 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1990).\n\nFactors in determining voidable transfers.— The noninclusive enumeration of factors contained in Sections 56-10-18 and 56-10-19 NMSA 1978 are to be considered when determining whether the funds that ordinarily would be exempt from attachment under Section 42-10-2 NMSA 1978 and this section should be set aside as the result of a voidable transfer.Dona Ana Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Dofflemeyer, 1993-NMSC-031, 115 N.M. 590, 855 P.2d 1054.\n\nFunds are not automatically protected.— The conversion of nonexempt funds into funds that are ordinarily exempt under Section 42-10-2 NMSA 1978 and this section are not automatically protected from attachment by creditors without an analysis of whether the transfer served the underlying purpose of the exemption statutes and was not in furtherance of an intent to defraud creditors.Dona Ana Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Dofflemeyer, 1993-NMSC-031, 115 N.M. 590, 855 P.2d 1054.\n\nUninsured motorist policy.— The proceeds from an uninsured motorist policy are exempt from attachment as accident insurance under this section.In re Portal, 2002-NMSC-011, 132 N.M. 171, 45 P.3d 891.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part II,\" see 2 Nat.

Such homestead is exempt from attachment, execution or foreclosure by a judgment creditor and from any proceeding of receivers or trustees in insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings and from executors or administrators in probate.\n\nB. The amount of the homestead exemption is:\n\n(1) one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000); or\n\n(2) three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) if the spouse of the person claiming the exemption died within two years prior to the date of claiming the homestead exemption and if the deceased spouse would have been able to claim the homestead exemption had the deceased spouse survived until the date of claiming the homestead exemption.\n\nC. As used in this section, \"domicile\" means any shelter or dwelling used by the person as a primary residence and may include a mobile home, trailer, recreational vehicle, outbuilding or other similar shelter, regardless of whether such dwelling complies with relevant housing or building regulations.\n\nD. This section shall be liberally construed in favor of the person claiming a homestead exemption.\n\nE. The provisions of this section shall not apply to garnishment or properly perfected liens of secured creditors.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 24-6-1, enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 215, § 6; 1973, ch. 277, § 1; 1978 Comp., § 42-10-9; 1979, ch. 9, § 1; 1979, ch. 182, § 3; 1987, ch. 193, § 1; 1993, ch. 44, § 1; 2007, ch. 95, § 1; 2023, ch. 104, § 7.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1971, ch. 215, § 6, repealed 24-6-1, 1953 Comp., relating to family homestead exemption and inapplicability of section to mortgages and statutory liens, and enacted a new section.\n\nCross references.— For municipal housing authority projects,see3-45-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor exemption from execution for claims to public lands of United States,see19-3-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor no exemption for property subject to quiet title suit for failure of co-owner to pay share of suit,see42-6-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor property exemption due assignments for benefit of creditors,see56-9-44 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor rules governing garnishment and writs of execution in the district, magistrate, and metropolitan courts,seeRules 1-065.1, 2-801, and 3-801 NMRA, respectively.\n\nFor form for claim of exemptions on executions,seeRule 4-803 NMRA.\n\nFor form for order on claim of exemption and order to pay in execution proceedings,seeRule 4-804 NMRA.\n\nFor form for application for writ of garnishment and affidavit,seeRule 4-805 NMRA.\n\nFor form for notice of right to claim exemptions from execution,seeRule 4-808A NMRA.\n\nFor form for claim of exemption from garnishment,seeRule 4-809 NMRA.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective July 1, 2023, changed the homestead exemption amounts, defined \"domicile\" and provided that the provisions of this section do not apply to garnishment or properly perfected liens of secured creditors; deleted \"Each person shall have exempt a homestead in a dwelling house and land occupied by the person or in a dwelling house occupied by the person although the dwelling is on land owned by another, provided that the dwelling is owned, leased or being purchased by the person claiming the exemption. Such a person has a homestead of sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) exempt from attachment, execution or foreclosure by a judgment creditor and from any proceeding of receivers or trustees in insolvency proceedings and from executors or administrators in probate. If the homestead is owned jointly by two persons, each joint owner is entitled to an exemption of sixty thousand dollars ($60,000).\"; and added Subsections A through E.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2023, ch. 104, § 13 provided that the provisions of Laws 2023, ch. 104 apply to actions filed on or after July 1, 2023.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, increased the homestead exemption from $30,000 to $60,000.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, deleted \"spouse, widow, widower or person who is supporting another\" following \"Each\" in the first sentence and substituted \"thirty thousand dollars ($30,000)\" for \"twenty thousand dollars ($20,000)\" in the second and third sentences.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, substituted \"Each spouse\" for \"A married person\" at the beginning of the section and added the last sentence.\n\nThe 1979 amendment,substituted \"shall have\" for \"may hold\" following \"supporting another person\" near the beginning of the first sentence; substituted \"has\" for \"may claim\" following \"Such a person\" near the beginning of the second sentence; and substituted \"twenty thousand dollars ($20,000)\" for \"ten thousand dollars ($10,000)\" near the beginning of the second sentence.\n\nPurpose of homestead exemption.— The purpose of the Homestead Act exemption statute is to \"prevent families from becoming destitute as the result of misfortune through common debts which generally are unforseen.\"Laughlin v. Lumbert, 1961-NMSC-064, 68 N.M. 351, 362 P.2d 507.\n\nTortious conduct not intended.— Where the defendant debtor in a foreclosure action voluntarily damages the property for the purpose of sabotaging the lawful interest of the plaintiff, the district court has the authority to impose an equitable lien against the debtor's homestead exemption.Coppler & Mannick v. Wakeland, 2005-NMSC-022, 138 N.M. 108, 117 P.3d 914.\n\nExemption statutes should be liberally construed.Laughlin v. Lumbert, 1961-NMSC-064, 68 N.M. 351, 362 P.2d 507;McFadden v. Murray, 1927-NMSC-039, 32 N.M. 361, 257 P. 999 (decided under former law).\n\nThe homestead exemption statute is to be construed liberally to the debtor's benefit.In re Jefferson, 163 Bankr. 204 (Bankr. D. N.M. 1993).\n\nLife estate in residence became part of the bankruptcy estate and fell within homestead exemption statute.— Where a chapter 7 trustee objected to debtor's claim of a homestead exemption in her residence, asserting that debtor no longer owned the property and it was not part of the bankruptcy estate, debtor was entitled to the homestead exemption where the evidence established that debtor held a life estate in her residence in which she claimed a homestead exemption, even after her execution of a warranty deed transferring the property to a trust, but verbally agreeing with the purchaser that debtor would live in the residence for the rest of her life and would assume responsibility for mortgage payments, property taxes, and maintenance and utility costs for the residence.In re Suarez, 625 B.R. 508 (Bankr. D. N.M. 2020).\n\nExemption under New Mexico law allows exemption against United States.— One entitled to an exemption of homestead under the laws of New Mexico may hold the same against the United States.United States v. Lesnet, 1897-NMSC-028, 9 N.M. 271, 50 P. 321 (decided under former law).\n\nConstitutionality.— The postjudgment execution statutes are unconstitutional as not providing adequate notice of allowable exemptions and the right to a hearing.Aacen v. San Juan Cnty. Sheriff's Dep't, 944 F.2d 691 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\n\"Supporting another person\".— This section as it read prior to the 1993 amendment did not require the claimant of a homestead exemption to have legal custody of his children, to be their sole supporter, or to have his children reside with him. It required only that the claimant be \"supporting\" another person.Ruybalid v. Segura, 1988-NMCA-084, 107 N.M. 660, 763 P.2d 369.\n\n\"Occupied\" defined.— The word \"occupied\" must not be construed so narrowly as to deprive a debtor of a homestead exemption she would be entitled to but for actual physical occupancy.In re Wells, 132 Bankr. 966 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1991);In re Jefferson, 163 Bankr. 204 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1993).\n\n\"Hold\" defined.— The word \"hold\" meant to keep, retain, or to preserve exempt from sale, or judgment, or order, and did not measure the character of the occupancy of the homestead.Corn v. Hyde, 1920-NMSC-023, 26 N.M. 36, 188 P. 1102 (decided under former law).\n\nEquitable as well as legal owners of real property are entitled to claima homestead exemption.Nesset v. Blueher Lumber Co., 33 Bankr. 326 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1983).\n\nHomestead exemption allowed where estate was still in the process of being administered.— Where debtor claimed a homestead exemption for an undivided quarter interest in an inherited house that was still titled in the name of the debtor's deceased parents, rather than the debtor, and where the neighborhood association sued debtor in his capacity as the personal representative of his parents' estate to collect unpaid neighborhood association assessments and objected to debtor's claimed homestead exemption, arguing that debtor's parents' estate, rather than debtor and his siblings, owned the homestead, the exemption was valid because the debtor had a sufficient ownership interest in the homestead. To come within the exemption, the dwelling must be \"owned, leased or being purchased by the person claiming the exemption,\" and under the Uniform Probate Code, title to a decedent's property, both real and personal, passes immediately upon death to the decedent's devisees or heirs.In re Archuletta, 614 B.R. 892 (Bankr. D. N.M. 2020).\n\nProperty interest in exempt property.— By creating exemptions from execution, New Mexico granted judgment debtors a property interest in retaining their exempt property, which is entitled to due process protection.Aacen v. San Juan Cnty. Sheriff's Dep't, 944 F.2d 691 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\nHomestead exemption allowed where there was no evidence of intent to defraud creditors.— Where debtor filed a voluntary petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C.), and where creditors asserted that debtor was not entitled to a homestead exemption under this section because he borrowed against the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy to make the down payment on the residence in which he claimed a homestead exemption, debtor's homestead exemption was allowed because he used exempt property,i.e., a portion of the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy, to acquire other exempt property. There was no evidence that debtor used a portion of the cash surrender value to purchase the residence with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors.In re Bushey, 559 B.R. 766 (Bankr. D. N.M. 2016).\n\nRight to claim exemption includes judgment debtors.— A judgment lien attaches to the equitable interest of a purchaser of real estate under a contract; the judgment lien may be foreclosed in the same manner as ordinary suits for the foreclosure of mortgages; and if the land in question is the judgment debtor's homestead, he may claim an exemption of $10,000 (now $60,000). Such a reading prevents a debtor from placing his assets beyond his creditor's reach and precludes the possibility of fraud being perpetrated upon the commercial community.Mutual Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Collins, 1973-NMSC-113, 85 N.M. 706, 516 P.2d 677.\n\nFamily homestead exemption was available to judgment debtors in foreclosure of a lien of a judgment obtained in a suit on a note.Laughlin v. Lumbert, 1961-NMSC-064, 68 N.M. 351, 362 P.2d 507.\n\nClaim of exemption under original execution did not remain effectiveto prevent a sale under a second or alias execution.Meyers Co. v. Mirabal, 1921-NMSC-098, 27 N.M. 472, 202 P. 693 (decided under former law).\n\nWaiving exemption by mortgage.— The owner of real estate can by mortgage or other act waive his exemption.Tomson v. Lerner, 1933-NMSC-078, 37 N.M. 546, 25 P.2d 209 (decided under former law).\n\nSale of homestead property.— Where a mortgagee filed a foreclosure action against the mortgagor and a judgment creditor holding a lien on the property, the mortgagor was entitled to the homestead exemption against the judgment lien where she had asserted the exemption in her answer to the action and obtained judicial approval of the sale of the property to a third party during the proceedings.Morgan Keegan Mortgage Co. v. Candelaria, 1998-NMCA-008, 124 N.M. 405, 951 P.2d 1066.\n\nAbandonment of homestead.— Debtor, who physically moved from the property because creditors had taken judgments against her, transcribed those judgments, and told her she was going to lose the house, did not abandon her homestead since it was undisputed that she intended to return to the house if allowed the exemption.In re Wells, 132 Bankr. 966 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1991).\n\nOccupation by claimant.— The debtor is entitled to the homestead exemption only if the dwelling house and land were occupied by him at the time of the petition.In re Jefferson, 163 Bankr. 204 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1993).\n\nWhen mortgagors not entitled to exemption.— Mortgagors were not entitled to a homestead exemption against junior judgment lienholders since they had an opportunity to advance claims for such exemption in their answers to cross claims which sought foreclosure of the liens, but failed to do so, and thereby failed to comply with Section 39-4-15 NMSA 1978, which required that such claim be made in answer to foreclosure suit. Nor were proceeds of sale shielded by this section from operation of writs of garnishment.Speckner v. Riebold, 1974-NMSC-029, 86 N.M. 275, 523 P.2d 10.\n\nWhen owner not entitled to exemption.— When the owner of a homestead voluntarily sells the property, the proceeds of sale are not exempt.In re Blair, 125 Bankr. 303 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1991).\n\nGarnishment of exemption to satisfy different judgment improper.— District court judgment permitting a family homestead exemption was not subject to garnishment to satisfy a judgment recovered in another New Mexico court since the first district court had jurisdiction in the premises and did not act erroneously.Laughlin v. Lumbert, 1961-NMSC-064, 68 N.M. 351, 362 P.2d 507).\n\nHomestead exemption not subject to attachment.— The legislature provided that the homestead exemption is not subject to attachment.Coppler & Mannick v. Wakeland, 2005-NMSC-022, 138 N.M. 108, 117 P.3d 914.\n\nHomestead exemption not subject to garnishment.— A homestead exemption is not subject to garnishment to satisfy a separate judgment.Coppler & Mannick v. Wakeland, 2005-NMSC-022, 138 N.M. 108, 117 P.3d 914.\n\n\"Attachment\" as used in New Mexico homestead exemption construed.— Where debtor filed motion to avoid a judgment lien on her house to the extent it impairs her homestead exemption, and where the judgment creditor argued that this section prevented a judgment lien from attaching to a homestead, that the \"exempt from attachment, execution or foreclosure by a judgment creditor\" language in this section means that his judgment lien, while attaching to the house, did not attach to the homestead, and that the judgment lien cannot be avoided, the bankruptcy court held that the judgment lien is subject to avoidance, because the phrase, \"exempt from attachment, execution or foreclosure by a judgment creditor\" refers to the creditor remedy of attachment, not to encumbering real property, and therefore the judgment lien encumbers the homestead.In re Tapia, 598 B.R. 1 (Bankr. D. N.M. 2019).\n\nEffect of homestead claimant voting in different precinct.— The fact that a homestead claimant voted in another precinct than that in which his homestead is situated is not conclusive evidence of abandonment.Corn v. Hyde, 1920-NMSC-023, 26 N.M. 36, 188 P. 1102 (decided under former law).\n\nPrior to 1979 amendment, exemption had to be claimed.— To be entitled to a homestead exemption under Section 39-4-15 NMSA 1978 and this section (prior to the 1979 amendment of this section), a party had to claim the exemption in his answer to a foreclosure action; otherwise, he could not claim it.USLife Title Ins. Co. v. Romero, 1982-NMCA-068, 98 N.M. 699, 652 P.2d 249, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794, and cert. quashed, 98 N.M. 762, 652 P.2d 1213 .\n\nIncreased exemption may not be claimed against lien attached prior to effective date of increase.— A legislative increase in the amount of the homestead exemption may not be claimed against a judgment lien that attaches prior to the effective date of the statutory amendment increasing the exemption.Ranchers State Bank v. Vega, 1982-NMSC-131, 99 N.M. 42, 653 P.2d 873.\n\nApplicability to trailers.— A debtor is entitled to claim a trailer used as a dwelling house as exempt, whether it is realty or personalty.In re Jefferson, 163 Bankr. 204 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1993).\n\nIncidental quasi-commercial use of property,in case where claimant kept two rental trailers on his property in addition to a trailer he used as dwelling house, did not defeat claim of exemption.In re Jefferson, 163 Bankr. 204 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1993).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part I,\" see 1 Nat. Resources J. 303 (1961).\n\nFor article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part II,\" see 2 Nat.
