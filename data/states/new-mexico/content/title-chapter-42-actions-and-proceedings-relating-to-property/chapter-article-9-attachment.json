      "text": "Creditors may sue their debtors before justices of the peace [magistrates] or in the district courts, by attachment, in the following cases, to wit:\n\nA. when the debtor is not a resident of, nor resides in this state;\n\nB. when the debtor has concealed himself, or absconded or absented himself from his usual place of abode in this state, so that the ordinary process of law cannot be passed upon him;\n\nC. when the debtor is about to remove his property or effects out of this state, or has fraudulently concealed or disposed of his property or effects so as to defraud, hinder or delay his creditors;\n\nD. when the debtor is about fraudulently to convey or assign, conceal or dispose of his property or effects, so as to hinder or delay his creditors;\n\nE. when debt was contracted out of this state, and the debtor has absconded or secretly removed his property or effects into the state, with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud his creditors;\n\nF. where the defendant is a corporation whose principal office or place of business is out of the state, unless such corporation shall have a designated agent in the state, upon whom service of process may be made in suits against the corporation;\n\nG. where the defendant fraudulently contracted the debt or incurred the obligation respecting which the suit is brought or obtained credit from the plaintiff by false pretenses;\n\nH. that the debt is for work and labor, or for any services rendered by the plaintiff, or his assignor, at the instance of the defendant;\n\nI. where the debt was contracted for the necessities of life.\n\nAn attachment may issue on a demand not yet due in any case where an attachment is authorized, in the same manner as upon demands already due.\n\nHistory:C.L. 1897, § 2685 (182), added by Laws 1907, ch. 107, § 1 (182); Code 1915, § 4299; Laws 1917, ch. 113, § 3; 1929, ch. 127, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 105-1601; 1941 Comp., § 22-101; 1953 Comp., § 26-1-1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For intervention in attachment proceedings,see42-9-29 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor abolition of justice of the peace,seeN.M. Const., art. VI, § 31.\n\nFor jurisdiction, powers and duties of the justices of the peace transferred to the magistrate court,see35-1-38 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor attachment procedure in the magistrate court,see35-9-1 to 35-9-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor failure to execute release after forfeiture of lease for oil, gas or mineral land,see70-1-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nConstitutionality.— New Mexico's present replevin statutes comply with due process standards established by United States supreme court inMitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600, 94 S. Ct. 1895, 40 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1974), and are therefore constitutional.First Nat'l Bank v. Southwest Yacht & Marine Supply Corp., 1984-NMSC-075, 101 N.M. 431, 684 P.2d 517.\n\nObject of remedy.— The sole object of an attachment is to create a prior lien on the property of the attachment debtor as security on any judgment that may thereafter be obtained against him on the demands covered by the attachment.Staab v. Hersch, 1884-NMSC-018, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 209, 3 P. 248.\n\nDebtor must be nonresident of state where attachment is sued out,and such statutes do not require that he should be a resident elsewhere.First Nat'l Bank v. Payton, 1919-NMSC-024, 25 N.M. 264, 180 P. 979.\n\nAttachment proceedings are auxiliary to actions at law,but each is characterized by separate pleading and distinct practice.Staab v. Hersch, 1884-NMSC-018, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 209, 3 P. 248 (decided under former law).\n\nAuxiliary where personal judgment sought, but otherwise with judgment in rem.— An attachment is auxiliary where a personal judgment is sought, but it is an original attachment where a judgment in rem only is sought.Southern Cal. Fruit Exch. v. Stamm, 1898-NMSC-008, 9 N.M. 361, 54 P. 345 (decided under former law).\n\nMaturity of demand necessary before issue of indebtedness raised.— When attachment is resorted to, for demands and credits not due, and the grounds of attachment are traversed, a speedy determination of that issue is important; but the main issue on the indebtedness cannot be raised, nor any defense interposed, until the maturity of the demand sued on, except to show that no such demand exists on which an attachment will lie.Staab v. Hersch, 1884-NMSC-018, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 209, 3 P. 248 (decided under former law).\n\nMagistrate or district court proper tribunals.— Under existing legislation attachment in tort actions may be had in both district and justice (now magistrate) courts.Butler Paper Co. v. Sydney, 1943-NMSC-047, 47 N.M. 463, 144 P.2d 170.\n\nAllegation must state present purpose and ground.— An allegation in an affidavit that the defendant \"has attempted fraudulently to convey\" does not state a present purpose and does not state a ground of attachment.Torlina v. Trorlicht, 1889-NMSC-012, 5 N.M. 148, 21 P. 68,aff'd, 1891-NMSC-019, 6 N.M. 54, 27 P. 794.\n\nJury trial optional.— Issue may be tried before the court either with or without a jury as in other cases at law.Everett v. Gilliland, 1943-NMSC-030, 47 N.M. 269, 141 P.2d 326.\n\nSetting aside conveyance before obtaining judgment improper.— Before obtaining judgment upon his demand, an attaching creditor cannot maintain an action to have an alleged conveyance of real estate set aside.Talbott v. Randall, 1885-NMSC-016, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 367, 5 P. 533 (decided under former law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part I,\" see 1 Nat.

Otero, 1930-NMSC-060, 35 N.M. 68, 290 P. 1015 (decided under former law).\n\nWhere notice of suit was bad, attempted service was bad,the levy itself was defective, the officer's return was imperfect and the bond carried no penalty, there were enough fatal defects to render the attachment proceeding bad even in a collateral attack.Larkin v. Folsom Town & Inv.
