      "text": "Any person having a right to the immediate possession of any goods or chattels, wrongfully taken or wrongfully detained, may bring an action of replevin for the recovery thereof and for damages sustained by reason of the unjust caption or detention thereof.\n\nHistory:C.L. 1897, § 2685 (228), added by Laws 1907, ch. 107, § 1 (228); Code 1915, § 4340; C.S. 1929, § 105-1701; 1941 Comp., § 25-1501; 1953 Comp., § 22-17-1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nConstitutionality.— The New Mexico replevin statutes allow property to be seized without giving the possessor, any possessor, any prior notice or opportunity for hearing. These prejudgment replevin provisions are unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment insofar as they deny the right to an opportunity to be heard before chattels are taken from their possessor.Sena v. Montoya, 346 F. Supp. 5 (D.N.M. 1972);seeFuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S. Ct. 1983, 32 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1972).\n\nNew Mexico's present replevin statutes comply with due process standards established by United States supreme court inMitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600, 94 S. Ct. 1895, 40 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1974), and are therefore constitutional.First Nat'l Bank v. Southwest Yacht & Marine Supply Corp., 1984-NMSC-075, 101 N.M. 431, 684 P.2d 517.\n\nPrimary purpose of action restoration of plaintiff's property.— Replevin, under this statute, is a possessory action, the primary object of which is plaintiff's right to the immediate possession of the property and, secondarily, the recovery of damages by the plaintiff for the unjust caption, or detention thereof.Novak v. Dow, 1970-NMCA-104, 82 N.M. 30, 474 P.2d 712.\n\nSecondary purpose, recovery of damages.— Replevin is a possessory action, the main purpose of which is to restore plaintiff to immediate possession of the property and which secondarily permits recovery also of damages for the unjust caption or detention.Johnson v. Terry, 1944-NMSC-035, 48 N.M. 253, 149 P.2d 795.\n\nPlaintiff recovers on strength of title or right to possession.— In replevin plaintiff must recover, if at all, on the strength of his own title or right to possession. Having no title or right of possession in himself, plaintiff cannot prevail on any claim of weakness in his adversary's title.Adams v. Heisen, 1967-NMSC-018, 77 N.M. 374, 423 P.2d 414.\n\nWrit accomplishes same function as summons.— The writ of replevin in an action of replevin accomplishes the same function in process, as does a summons in an ordinary civil action.Citizens Bank v. Robinson Bros. Wrecking, 1966-NMSC-114, 76 N.M. 408, 415 P.2d 538.\n\nExclusive remedy for recovery of goods and chattels.— The action of replevin provided for by this statute is exclusive of all other remedies for the recovery of the possession of goods and chattels, and an action in the nature of detinue at common law is not maintainable in this jurisdiction.Troy Laundry Mach. Co. v. Carbon City Laundry Co., 1921-NMSC-038, 27 N.M. 117, 196 P. 745.\n\nStrict statutory compliance required.— Any replevin action initiated pursuant to New Mexico's replevin statutes must comply strictly with the statutory requirements in order not to violate a defendant's due process rights.First Nat'l Bank v. Southwest Yacht & Marine Supply Corp., 1984-NMSC-075, 101 N.M. 431, 684 P.2d 517.\n\nSection replaces common law actions of replevin and detinue.— This section provides for an action in all cases where, under the common law, either replevin or detinue might have been maintained.Troy Laundry Mach. Co. v. Carbon City Laundry Co., 1921-NMSC-038, 27 N.M. 117, 196 P. 745.\n\nThe action of replevin is a statutory proceeding designed to take the place of the common law actions of replevin and detinue.Citizens Bank v. Robinson Bros. Wrecking, 1966-NMSC-114, 76 N.M. 408, 415 P.2d 538.\n\nDamages for diminution in value.— This section permits the recovery of damages for the depreciation or diminution in value of the property replevied.Sec. Pac. Fin. Servs. v. Signfilled Corp., 1998-NMCA-046, 125 N.M. 38, 956 P.2d 837.\n\nCourt cannot augment or limit provisions of statute.— Provisions of replevin statute for seizing the property under a writ of replevin cannot be dispensed with, limited or augmented by rule of court.Johnson v. Terry, 1944-NMSC-035, 48 N.M. 253, 149 P.2d 795 (decided under former law).\n\nCourt lacks power to award possession to either party.— Since replevin under statute is a possessory action, primary purpose of which is to restore actual possession of the goods, where chattel or goods are not found or seized, court is without power or jurisdiction to award actual possession to either party.Wood v. Grau, 1951-NMSC-060, 55 N.M. 429, 234 P.2d 362.\n\nWhere defendant claims title and possession, no demand necessary.— No demand is necessary in an action of replevin, where the defendant claims title and right to possession as incident thereto in himself.Heisch v. J.L. Bell & Co., 1902-NMSC-028, 11 N.M. 523, 70 P. 572;Ross v. Berry, 1912-NMSC-004, 17 N.M. 48, 124 P. 342.\n\nRights of lien claimant.— Lien claimant, by voluntarily parting with possession of a chattel upon which he has a lien, does not thereby waive the lien, but waives the right to possession of the chattel, and may not repossess it merely on the strength of his lien, in the absence of special circumstances.Mathieu v. Roberts, 1926-NMSC-025, 31 N.M. 469, 247 P. 1066.\n\nNo recovery of expenses incurred in locating cattle.— Plaintiff in replevin for cattle sold by one representing himself to be plaintiff's partner was not entitled to recover expenses incurred in locating cattle prior to demand of a good-faith purchaser.Irick v. Elkins, 1933-NMSC-106, 38 N.M. 113, 28 P.2d 657.\n\nRight to sell includes the right to possess,and thus the right to maintain replevin to recover the possession.Kitchen v. Schuster, 1907-NMSC-021, 14 N.M. 164, 89 P. 261.\n\nSeizure of property requisite to trial court's jurisdiction.— Since seizure of property under the writ of replevin is a requisite to the trial court's jurisdiction to determine the right to the possession of the property, where there has been no such seizure, the trial court does not have jurisdiction to grant a summary judgment determining right to possession.Novak v. Dow, 1970-NMCA-104, 82 N.M. 30, 474 P.2d 712.\n\nJurisdiction of court dependent upon issuance and service of writ.— The jurisdiction of the court, to hear and determine actions in replevin instituted pursuant to this statute, is dependent upon the issuance and service of the writ which brings under the control of the court the property for the purpose of rendering a judgment in accordance with the object and purpose of the statute.Novak v. Dow, 1970-NMCA-104, 82 N.M. 30, 474 P.2d 712.\n\nThe issuance and service of the writ of replevin is necessary to the jurisdiction of the court to hear and determine the action in replevin since it is by this means that the property is brought under control of the court for the purpose of giving judgment pursuant to the object and purpose of the statute.Johnson v. Terry, 1944-NMSC-035, 48 N.M. 253, 149 P.2d 795.\n\nSufficiency of complaint.— A complaint in replevin which alleges all the facts required by statute to sustain the right is sufficient.Milliken v. Martinez, 1916-NMSC-044, 22 N.M. 61, 159 P. 952.\n\nIn action of replevin, general verdict is sufficient,in absence of request for special findings.Gallegos v. Lopez, 1922-NMSC-001, 27 N.M. 603, 204 P. 71.\n\nPossession of property and damages only judgment rendered for plaintiff.— The only judgment that may be rendered, under the statute, in favor of the plaintiff, is for the possession of the property and damages for its unlawful caption or detention.Novak v. Dow, 1970-NMCA-104, 82 N.M. 30, 474 P.2d 712.\n\nThe only judgment that can be rendered in favor of a plaintiff under this statute is that of recognizing possession of the property in the plaintiff and damages for its unlawful caption or detention by the defendant.Johnson v. Terry, 1944-NMSC-035, 48 N.M. 253, 149 P.2d 795.\n\nJudgment on merits bars recovery in subsequent action of trespass.— A judgment in replevin for defendants, appearing to have been rendered on the merits of the controversy, is a bar to any recovery by plaintiffs in a subsequent action of trespass between the same parties for the same taking of the same goods.Lowenthal v. Baca, 1900-NMSC-025, 10 N.M. 347, 62 P. 982 (decided under former law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part II,\" see 2 Nat. Resources J. 75 (1962).\n\nAm.

In such case, the verdict, if for the plaintiff, shall fix the value of the property, as well as the damages for detention; upon which verdict plaintiff shall have judgment for such damages, and either for the value of such property, as so fixed, or for the return thereof, at his election.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 25-1507a, enacted by Laws 1945, ch. 14, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 22-17-7.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCourt cannot augment or limit provisions of statute.— Provisions of replevin statute for seizing the property under a writ of replevin cannot be dispensed with, limited or augmented by rule of court.Johnson v. Terry, 1944-NMSC-035, 48 N.M. 253, 149 P.2d 795 (decided under former law).\n\nWhen suit dismissed, even though implied waiver of seizure.— Where there was no showing that defendant had either actual or constructive possession of the guns at the time of trial, the dismissal of the suit by the trial court was proper, even if there was an implied waiver of seizure and delivery of the guns as provided in this section.Piner v. Pender, 1972-NMSC-010, 83 N.M. 502, 494 P.2d 164.\n\nDate of wrongful detention, date for fixing property value.— The time for fixing the value of the property in case where plaintiff waived seizure and delivery of property and asked for damages was the date of the wrongful detention.Valley Chevrolet Co. v. Whitaker, 1966-NMSC-130, 76 N.M. 488, 416 P.2d 154.\n\nFair and reasonable basis for determination of value necessary.— Where the evidence revealed the value of property plaintiff sought judgment for as of the date defendant obtained possession, the value of the property when wrongfully detained one week later could reasonably be inferred. A fair and reasonable basis for determination of the value is all that is required.Valley Chevrolet Co. v. Whitaker, 1966-NMSC-130, 76 N.M. 488, 416 P.2d 154.\n\nSlight departure in relief awarded, not ground for complaint.— In an action of replevin, where plaintiff waived seizure, affidavit and bond, and the trial court found for plaintiff, giving him an election whether to accept a return of the property subject to a lien which defendants had established on the property or take judgment for the value thereof, less the amount of the lien held by defendants, defendants could not complain of the slight departure in relief awarded if it did not comply literally with a statutory judgment in replevin.Ace Auto Co. v. Russell, 1955-NMSC-025, 59 N.M. 182, 281 P.2d 143.\n\nNot separating actual value and damages, harmless error only.— Even though under this statute the actual value of the property and damages should have been separated, the error was harmless where, from an examination of the entire record, it would appear that the judgment of the trial court granted substantial justice. Therefore, it would be going too far to deprive a plaintiff of a recovery upon no better grounds than the bare informality of a verdict.Hicks v. Maestas, 1962-NMSC-102, 70 N.M. 347, 373 P.2d 916.\n\nAm.

Sandoval v. Taylor, 1939-NMSC-013, 43 N.M. 170, 87 P.2d 681.\n\nEven though statutory replevin in New Mexico is primarily a possessory action, it also involves the question of damages for the unlawful detention or loss of use.McCallister v. M-A-C Fin. Co., 332 F.2d 633 (10th Cir. 1964).\n\nStatute takes no cognizance of party's motive in bringing wrongful replevin,nor does court find merit in the contention that recovery of damages is dependent upon proof of both \"with effect\" and \"without unreasonable delay.\" Such an interpretation would result in an absurdity or irrationality.Riggs v. Gardikas, 1967-NMSC-120, 78 N.M. 5, 427 P.2d 890.\n\n\"With effect\" and \"without delay\" defined.— The words of this statute \"with effect\" mean with success, and \"without delay\" means without unreasonable or unnecessary delay.McCallister v. M-A-C Fin. Co., 332 F.2d 633 (10th Cir. 1964).\n\nIn construing the words \"with effect and without delay\" the court found the words \"with effect\" to mean with success and \"without delay\" to mean without unreasonable or unnecessary delay.Vigil v. Johnson, 1955-NMSC-102, 60 N.M. 273, 291 P.2d 312.\n\nWords of statute \"with effect\" mean with success.Riggs v. Gardikas, 1967-NMSC-120, 78 N.M. 5, 427 P.2d 890.\n\nIssue of damages either litigated or barred forever.— The language of this statute is mandatory and the issue of damages must be litigated in the replevin action or be barred thereafter.McCallister v. M-A-C Fin. Co., 332 F.2d 633 (10th Cir. 1964).\n\nDefendant must show injury in order to recoverunder this statute.First Nat'l Bank v. Southwest Yacht & Marine Supply Corp., 1984-NMSC-075, 101 N.M. 431, 684 P.2d 517.\n\nMeasure of damages based upon loss of use.— The measure of damages is based upon the loss of use of the property from the time of delivery, and doubled by the statute.McCallister v. M-A-C Fin. Co., 332 F.2d 633 (10th Cir. 1964).\n\nMeasure of damages recoverable by debtor for creditor's wrongful replevin is double damages for the use (or reasonable rental value) of property wrongfully replevied, for period of time from its wrongful taking to its tendered return.First Nat'l Bank v. Southwest Yacht & Marine Supply Corp., 1984-NMSC-075, 101 N.M. 431, 684 P.2d 517.\n\nDamages valued at time and place where property taken.— The measure of damages in replevin is the value of the personal property at the time and place where it was taken, together with the damages sustained by reason of its unlawful detention.Heisch v. J.L. Bell & Co., 1902-NMSC-028, 11 N.M. 523, 70 P. 572 (decided under former law).\n\nDouble damages.— If damages by reason of a wrongful replevin are proven, the court has no option but to double them if requested.Riggs v. Gardikas, 1967-NMSC-120, 78 N.M. 5, 427 P.2d 890.\n\nWhere no damage proven, plaintiff recovers nominal damages.— The measure of damages where the plaintiff recovers in a replevin suit, where he has taken possession under the writ, is the damage proved for the detention of the property, and if none is proved, nominal damages.Hyde v. Elmer, 1907-NMSC-008, 14 N.M. 39, 88 P. 1132.\n\nAbsent proof of damages, judgment should provide for nominal damages.McCallister v. M-A-C Fin. Co., 332 F.2d 633 (10th Cir. 1964).\n\nWhen defendant not obligated to reduce damages.— In replevin suit to recover an automobile for nonpayment of purchase-money notes, the defense being that defendant had paid the due note to the original holder thereof without notice that it had been assigned, defendant is not obligated to produce a forthcoming bond or take other precautions to reduce the damages. The statute imposes double damages for wrongful levy, to compensate for the detriment proximately caused thereby.Giannini v. Wilson, 1939-NMSC-052, 43 N.M. 460, 95 P.2d 209.\n\nAttorneys fees not recoverable.— It is error to award attorneys fees to the intervenor for defending the replevin action. It seems to be well settled in this jurisdiction that absent statutory authority or rule of court, attorneys fees are not recoverable as an item of damages.Riggs v. Gardikas, 1967-NMSC-120, 78 N.M. 5, 427 P.2d 890.\n\nEffect of plaintiff's taking wool from replevined sheep on damages.— In replevin action, where plaintiff took wool from replevined sheep during detention, and judgment was for defendant, the wool, or its value, was recoverable, but not as damages, the statute allowing double damages for the use of the property, and the property recovered by defendant being the sheep and wool.Wirt v. George W. Kutz & Co., 1910-NMSC-039, 15 N.M. 500, 110 P. 575.\n\nWhere plaintiff files motion to dismiss, he abandons suit,and is liable for the double damages expressly authorized.Brannin v. Bremen, 1880-NMSC-001, 2 N.M. 40 (decided under former law).\n\nOrder sustaining objection to complaint establishes defendant's right to judgmentagainst the plaintiff and his surety.Farmers' Cotton Fin. Corp. v. White, 1935-NMSC-017, 39 N.M. 132, 42 P.2d 204.\n\nThis section and Section 42-8-19 NMSA 1978 not mutually exclusive.— This section and Section 42-8-19 NMSA 1978, providing for the dissolution of a writ upon disproof of the supporting affidavit with an award of damages to the defendant, are not mutually exclusive.First Nat'l Bank v. Southwest Yacht & Marine Supply Corp.,1984-NMSC-075, 101 N.M. 431, 684 P.2d 517.\n\nDebtor may pursue other remedies for other wrongs.— While debtor's remedies for wrongful replevin are limited by replevin statutes, those statutes do not preclude other causes of action that debtor may have that arose independent of any wrongful replevin.First Nat'l Bank v. Southwest Yacht & Marine Supply Corp., 1984-NMSC-075, 101 N.M. 431, 684 P.2d 517.\n\nEffect of permitting party to plead general denial and cross-claim.— Where the plaintiff in replevin, without objection, permits defendant to plead both a general denial and a cross-action claiming judgment for unpaid portion of the purchase-price of the chattels, and joins issue with defendant on this claim, such plaintiff will not be heard to complain after verdict for defendant, that the replevin issues were not determined by the verdict.Reed v. Sibley, 1931-NMSC-003, 35 N.M. 307, 296 P. 572.\n\nSummary judgment granted when action barred by res judicata.— It was not error for the federal court to grant summary judgment for defendant because the conversion action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Plaintiff claimed prior state court judgment resolved only the issue of defendant's money damages, and that a state court judgment is an estoppel only as to fact questions in issue in that case which were essential to a decision thereon. Held, that the counterclaim in the state court was a claim for a wrongful replevin, under this section, whose purpose was to settle in one suit all questions that may arise out of the unlawful taking or detention of property, and the damages issue had to be litigated in the replevin action or be barred thereafter.Rios v. Cessna Fin. Corp., 488 F.2d 25 (10th Cir. 1973).\n\nBurden on defendant to prove price of substitute articles.— Where some of the property sought to be recovered in replevin action belongs to plaintiff, it becomes burden of defendants to tender evidence and prove the actual value, article by article, or class by class, if some of the same kind had a common value, of the property whose assessed value they elect to take in lieu of a return of the property.Palmer v. Young, 1951-NMSC-067, 55 N.M. 469, 235 P.2d 534.\n\nAssessment of damages by court without jurywas proper where plaintiff abandoned suit by dismissal.Lamy v. Remuson, 1882-NMSC-009, 2 N.M. 245 (decided under former law).\n\nSatisfaction of judgment by return of property.— If, in an action of replevin, an alternative judgment is given, and at the time of the rendition of the judgment no election is made to take the money value of the property recovered, the return of the property before a levy of execution is a satisfaction of the judgment.Johnson v. Gallegos, 1900-NMSC-001, 10 N.M. 1, 60 P. 71 (decided under former law).\n\nWhere trial court declines to enter judgment in alternativefor return of the property or for the payment of its assessed value, judgment must be reversed.Downing Bros. v. Mitchell, 1944-NMSC-065, 48 N.M. 561, 154 P.2d 235.\n\nJudgment of state court res judicata as to damages.— Where car dealer is sued for replevin, the replevin action is tried on the merits, judgment is entered dismissing the complaint and awarding possession of the cars to the car dealer, and no appeal is taken, the judgment becomes final and the issue of damages is not raised in the first trial; in a second suit, the judgment in the state court is res judicata as to an issue of damages allegedly resulting from the wrongful replevin, and bars recovery.McCallister v. M-A-C Fin. Co., 332 F.2d 633 (10th Cir. 1964).\n\nOrder of restitution after judgment.— In action of replevin, where, after return of property to defendant, there was judgment for plaintiff, followed by order of restitution, the sheriff, claiming interest, was not entitled to show cause why he should be discharged from the order of restitution. Veeder v. Fiske, 1891-NMSC-037, 6 N.M. 288, 27 P. 642 (decided under former law).\n\nRight of appeal not hindered by previous nonsuit.— Where a plaintiff in replevin is compelled to abandon his case by an adverse decision upon a vital point therein, to which he excepts, it is not a voluntary nonsuit precluding appeal.Ward v. Broadwell, 1854-NMSC-001, 1 N.M. 75 (decided under former law).\n\nFailure to perfect appeal.— Where plaintiff failed to perfect appeal from order dismissing complaint, defendant had not so elected to take judgment for costs as to prevent him from afterward claiming the return of property or its value.Farmers' Cotton Fin. Corp. v. White, 1935-NMSC-017, 39 N.M. 132, 42 P.2d 204.\n\nDismissal of plaintiff's appeal not to deprive defendant of recovery.— On appeal to the district court, in an action of replevin brought before a justice of the peace (now magistrate), the plaintiff by dismissal of his appeal cannot deprive defendant of his right to recover against plaintiff the value of the property and damages for its detention, nor relieve the sureties on the appeal bond.Strauss v. Smith, 1896-NMSC-006, 8 N.M. 391, 45 P. 930 (decided under former law).\n\nWhen failure to direct alternative relief not error.— Where judgment did not alternatively provide for the return of the property or to award payment of the assessed value of the property under this section, the failure to direct alternative relief was not error as the court had full authority to return the parties to their original positions when it ordered a dismissal of the case even though in an ordinary replevin case the judgment must be entered in accordance with the statute; in this particular case, however, where there was no replevin bond, an award to the defendant of the assessed value of the property would have been a useless thing.Historical Soc'y of N.M. v. Montoya, 1964-NMSC-132, 74 N.M. 285, 393 P.2d 21.\n\nJudgment reversed for court's refusal to allow release of bondsman.— Where the affidavit for a writ of replevin was filed, the bond executed by an agent of plaintiff, and on a plea of not guilty by defendant, the cause was tried by a jury and judgment entered in favor of defendant for the value of the property with double damages and costs for the failure of plaintiff to prosecute the action, such judgment would be reversed on appeal for the refusal of the trial court to permit plaintiff to release the original bondsman and to substitute another instead in order to render such original bondsman competent as a witness, for he would then have been competent, being no longer a party.Ward v. Broadwell, 1854-NMSC-001, 1 N.M. 75 (decided under former law).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —66 Am.
