      "text": "When any lands, tenements or hereditaments shall be owned in joint tenancy, tenancy in common or coparcenary, whether the right or title be derived by donation, grant, purchase, devise or descent, it shall be lawful for any one or more persons interested, whether they be in possession or not, to present to the district court their complaint in chancery, praying for a division and partition of such premises, according to the respective rights of the parties interested therein, and for a sale thereof, if it shall appear that partition cannot be made without great prejudice to the owners.\n\nHistory:C.L. 1897, § 2685 (266), added by Laws 1907, ch. 107, § 1 (266); Code 1915, § 4379; C.S. 1929, § 105-1901; 1941 Comp., § 25-1201; 1953 Comp., § 22-13-1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The New Mexico Rules of Civil Procedure for District Courts provide that there shall be only one form of action, \"civil action,\" and that a civil action is commenced by filing a complaint.SeeRules 1-002 and 1-003 NMRA.\n\nCross references.— For an attorney receiving fee in land entitled to partition,see42-6-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor real estate descriptions in pleading,see47-1-46 NMSA 1978.\n\nPartition of land valuable as a wind farm.— The right to harvest wind energy is an inchoate interest in land which does not become vested until reduced to possession by employing it for a useful purpose and does not prevent the partition of land the primary value of which is for wind farm development.Romero v. Bernell, 603 F. Supp. 2d, 1333 (D.N.M. 2009).\n\nPartition possible notwithstanding easement.— A suit for partition may be maintained notwithstanding the land is subject to an easement.Thompson v. de Snyder, 1908-NMSC-011, 14 N.M. 403, 94 P. 1014.\n\nCourt determines equities as between parties.— The trial court, in making any partition of lands, has the right to make a determination of the equities as between the parties.Prude v. Lewis, 1967-NMSC-174, 78 N.M. 256, 430 P.2d 753.\n\nLeaseholds may be partitioned.— The Partition Act does not abrogate common-law equitable judicial partition powers; thus, the partitioning of federal and state grazing leases was not precluded.Sims v. Sims, 1996-NMSC-078, 122 N.M. 618, 930 P.2d 153.\n\nThe Commissioner of Public Lands was not an indispensable party to an action involving the partition of state grazing leases.Sims v.

Sims, 1996-NMSC-078, 122 N.M. 618, 930 P.2d 153.\n\nParol partition.— Where the adult heirs of the deceased owners of the property partitioned the property; one part of the property was set aside to plaintiff who was a minor; and plaintiff knew of the parol partition, but plaintiff never carried out the partition before or after reaching the age of majority by taking possession of the tract, asserting ownership, or doing things denoting an acceptance of the oral agreement, the parol partition did not destroy the co-tenancy as to plaintiff and the other owners.Gurule v. De Chacon, 1956-NMSC-108, 61 N.M. 488, 303 P.2d 696.\n\nIntervention of commissioners essential for entry of judgment.— The district court has no power to enter a judgment partitioning real estate without the intervention of commissioners; but where judgment is entered upon a report by the commissioners which is reversed on appeal, the trial court may properly refuse to enter judgment upon remand.Field v. Hudson, 1918-NMSC-008, 25 N.M. 7, 176 P. 73.\n\nEffect of judgment in partition suit.— A judgment in a statutory partition suit declaring the rights of all the parties, ordering partition, and appointing commissioners for such purpose is an interlocutory decree.Torrez v.

Although this right is sometimes said to be absolute, it can be denied where the partition would be against public policy, legal principles or equitable principles, or is waived by an agreement of the parties.Martinez v. Martinez, 1982-NMSC-097, 98 N.M. 535, 650 P.2d 819.\n\nCommissioners must acquire firsthand knowledge of value of premises.— The provision that the \"commissioners shall go upon the premises and make partition of said lands\" is directory only, requiring nothing more than that the commissioners fully acquaint themselves with and acquire firsthand knowledge of the value of the premises before making partition.Sandoval v. Sandoval, 1956-NMSC-027, 61 N.M. 38, 294 P.2d 278.\n\nExcept where commissioners are longtime residents of area and have personal knowledgeof the land, the residential properties and their respective values, there is sufficient compliance with the statute even if none of the commissioners has actually gone upon the land subsequent to their selection.Sandoval v. Sandoval, 1956-NMSC-027, 61 N.M. 38, 294 P.2d 278.\n\nWhen waiver of appointment incomplete.— Three of the defendants and the plaintiff could not effectively accomplish a total departure from the requirement of the rule that a commissioner be appointed where it nowhere appeared that the other six defendants, with interests in the property, ever agreed to waive the statutory procedure.Marquez v. Marquez, 1965-NMSC-016, 74 N.M. 795, 399 P.2d 282.\n\nNo instruction required.— The statute contains no requirement for instruction of the commissioners and no error is committed by the court in refusing to give requested instructions.Field v. Hudson, 1918-NMSC-008, 25 N.M. 7, 176 P. 73.\n\nParties may request instructions.— Where instructions to commissioners correctly stated the law under the statutes, and where both parties had requested the court to instruct the commissioners as to the law, no complaint could be successfully made against the instructions given.Field v. Hudson, 1918-NMSC-008, 25 N.M. 7, 176 P. 73.\n\nRights, titles and interests of parties should first be determinedand a decree entered accordingly so that the appraisers can then, as required by the provisions of this section, fairly and impartially make a partition of the premises in accordance with the decree of the court as to the rights and interests of the parties, if such can be accomplished.Prude v. Lewis, 1967-NMSC-174, 78 N.M. 256, 430 P.2d 753.\n\nGiving notice or hearing evidence not part of duties.— The commissioners are not obligated to give notice to the parties and to hear evidence, the parties interested in having their day in court when the report comes before the court for approval or rejection.Field v. Hudson, 1918-NMSC-008, 25 N.M. 7, 176 P. 73.\n\nCourt powerless to enter judgment without report.— Under the statute, the court has no power to enter a judgment partitioning real estate without the intervention of commissioners, and the judgment of the court must be based upon the report of such commissioners.Field v. Hudson, 1918-NMSC-008, 25 N.M. 7, 176 P. 73.\n\nProcedure required of trial court to contravene recommendation.— The trial court, after appointing commissioners in an action for partition, may not contravene the recommendation from the commissioners without first filing findings of fact and conclusions of law expressing the reasons for not following such recommendation.Moore v. Sussman, 1978-NMSC-066, 92 N.M. 70, 582 P.2d 1283.\n\nReports rejected when influence exerted.— When the conduct of an interested party influences the acts of the commissioners, the reports should be rejected.Sandoval v.

Hudson, 1918-NMSC-008, 25 N.M. 7, 176 P. 73.\n\nCategorizing lands by descriptive names not error.— There was no error by the trial court in its acceptance of the commissioners' report which categorized the lands involved by descriptive names rather than by metes and bounds in accordance with this section, as the applicable metes and bounds descriptions were contained in the various pleadings, exhibits and in the transcript, and there was no objection to the use of area names at the time of the hearing, and the transcript reflects that the parties were quite alert about the particular areas in controversy.Sullivan v.

      "text": "A. Should the commissioners be of the opinion that the real estate is so circumstanced that a partition thereof cannot be made without manifest prejudice to the owners or proprietors of the same, they shall proceed to appraise the real estate at its cash value at the time, deducting the amount of all liens and encumbrances against such real estate, and the commissioners shall so report to the court and file with their said report a written appraisal. Any party to the action who shall have been adjudged by the court to have an interest in the real estate appraised, may within ten days from the date of filing of said report and appraisal contest said report or said appraisal, and for such purpose shall file in the cause an affidavit setting forth wherein said report, appraisal or both is incorrect; provided, that the affidavit shall put in issue only the value of the real estate as shown by the appraisal and the question as to whether or not the real estate is so circumstanced that a partition hereof cannot be had without manifest prejudice to the owners or proprietors thereof, and the court shall hear proof touching the matters set forth in the affidavit, and if the report or the appraisal shall be found by the court to be incorrect, the court shall determine the value of the real estate and whether or not the real estate can be divided without manifest prejudice to the owners or proprietors thereof. If the report or appraisal shall be found by the court to be correct the same shall be confirmed by the court. In the event the report of the commissioners shall not be contested within the time above provided, or in the event the report of the commissioners shall be confirmed by the court, the court, in its discretion, may order the premises to be sold at public or private sale, providing in the order for reasonable public notice of such sale on such terms and conditions as it may prescribe; provided, that if the court does not order such sale to be made for cash, a cash payment of not less than one-quarter of the purchase money shall be required by the court, to be made to the person or persons, who shall be appointed by the court to make such sale, by the purchaser of such land at the time of such sale, the balance of such purchase price to be paid and secured in such manner as the court shall direct. If sale is made at private sale, same shall be made for not less than its full value as determined as aforesaid. If the value determined as aforesaid shall be less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) the court shall authorize sale of the property at a public sale to the highest and best bidder thereat. If such value determined as aforesaid shall be ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or more, public sale of said property shall not be made for less than two-thirds of its value as so determined and fixed. Any sale hereunder shall be subject to any and all liens deducted as provided herein in making the appraisal.\n\nB. The person or persons who shall be appointed by the court to make sale of said real estate shall make and execute good and sufficient conveyance or conveyances to the purchaser or purchasers thereof which shall operate as an effectual bar both in law and equity against such owners and proprietors, parties to the proceedings, and all persons claiming [under] them; and the person or persons making such sale shall report their proceedings to the court and shall pay over the moneys arising therefrom to the parties entitled to receive the same under the direction of the court.\n\nHistory:C.L. 1897, § 2685 (272), added by Laws 1907, ch. 107, § 1 (272); Code 1915, § 4385; C.S. 1929, § 105-1907; Laws 1939, ch. 170, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 25-1207; 1953 Comp., § 22-13-7; Laws 1959, ch. 164, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nReport couched in language from statute, proper.— Report of commissioners in words of statute finding \"that the said lots are so circumstanced that a partition thereof cannot be made without manifest prejudice to the owners of the same\" is sufficient.Field v.

If partition cannot be made without manifest prejudice to the cotenants and sale of the estate is ordered, the costs of the action shall be apportioned among all the cotenants, and the proportion of the costs assessed against each cotenant shall by the court be deducted and withheld from the distributive share of the proceeds of the sale assigned to the cotenant.\n\nB.
