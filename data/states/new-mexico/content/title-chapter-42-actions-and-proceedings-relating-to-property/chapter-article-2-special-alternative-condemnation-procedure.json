      "heading": "Declaration of intent.Section 42-2-2 - Definitions",
      "text": "The legislature hereby determines and declares that the construction of urgently needed public roads and state highways is being delayed by the inability to enter into timely possession of the condemned property; that the landowner must wait the termination of prolonged litigation before he receives compensation for his property; that the delay in possession and therefore construction of the facility results in increased construction costs and thereby injuriously affects the public. The legislature, recognizing its responsibility, intends to solve these problems by establishing a special procedure whereby the state can enter into possession at the inception of the proceeding, and the interests of the property owner are protected by providing for an adequate bond prior to vesting of title and the taking of possession and also safeguarding the property owners' right to a speedy judicial determination of the total just compensation due. This legislation is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, [and] safety, the promotion of the general welfare and to minimize the economic and financial dislocation caused by highway construction.\n\nThe special procedure set forth herein shall be in addition to any other condemnation procedure now in effect and shall not be construed as repealing or amending such procedure by implication.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 22-9-39, enacted by Laws 1959, ch. 324, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nLegislative intent.— It would have been practically impossible for the legislature to have stated more clearly their intention that compensation should be paid when public property was condemned for highway purposes. The requirement for payment is clearly without regard to the nature of uses being made and accordingly includes property being used for a governmental as well as a proprietary purpose.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1963-NMSC-074, 72 N.M. 86, 380 P.2d 830.\n\nProvision for compensation when property condemned for highway purposes.— Since highways are state projects paid for by the public of the state at large, including in many instances contribution by the federal government, it is only just and proper that the legislature in its wisdom should provide for compensation when public property is taken for highway purposes.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1963-NMSC-074, 72 N.M. 86, 380 P.2d 830 (1963).\n\nLoss of business due to restriction of direct access, noncompensable.— Loss of business or of prospective business, because the traveling public cannot reach a roadside business establishment as readily as before the restriction of direct access, amounts only to a diversion of traffic and is noncompensable.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Brock, 1968-NMSC-165, 80 N.M. 80, 451 P.2d 984.\n\nOnce reasonable access is given to the main highway system by means of frontage roads, any circuity of travel occasioned by the loss of direct ingress and egress is noncompensable.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Brock, 1968-NMSC-165, 80 N.M. 80, 451 P.2d 984.\n\nMere inconvenience resulting from the closing of streets or roads which requires circuity of travel by those abutting on such roads to reach the main highway system does not give rise to a legal right in one so inconvenienced, when another reasonable, although perhaps not equally accessible, means of ingress and egress is afforded.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Brock, 1968-NMSC-165, 80 N.M. 80, 451 P.2d 984.\n\nRule relating to dismissal of actions inapplicable.— The special statutory eminent domain procedure is inconsistent with rule 41(b) and (e), N.M.R. Civ. P. (now Rule 1-0041 NMRA), relating to dismissal of actions, and these rules are therefore inapplicable to eminent domain proceedings brought under the special alternative procedure where a permanent order of entry has been made as to some part of the property being condemned.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Burks, 1968-NMSC-121, 79 N.M. 373, 443 P.2d 866.\n\nEffect of trial court's refusal to allow expert to testify.— The trial court's refusal to allow plaintiff's expert appraiser to testify as to the fair market value of the property in question, after a detailed and lengthy examination into the expert's qualifications was reversible error.City of Santa Fe v. Gonzales, 1969-NMSC-085, 80 N.M. 401, 456 P.2d 875.\n\nAll public land, no matter how acquired, subject to condemnation.— The fact that public lands were in part or whole acquired by trust funds is immaterial. The chapter draws no such distinction. It subjects all public land to eminent domain without distinction so long as a determination has been made that the land is required for a greater public need. Laws 1959, ch. 324, gives the state and all of its political subdivisions the right to acquire public property by right of eminent domain for use of public highways. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-156.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Frontland Taking - Backland Value\", 9 Nat. Resources J. 237 (1969).",

The petition shall include but not be limited to the following:\n\n(1) a statement by the petitioner of its authority to bring the action;\n\n(2) a general description of the public purpose for which the property is being condemned;\n\n(3) a statement that the action is brought pursuant to this statute;\n\n(4) an accurate surveyed description of the property to be condemned describing the same by metes and bounds and said description shall be incorporated in the petition with or without reference to maps or plats attached to said petition; the property of each defendant to be condemned shall be described separately, and each tract under separate ownerships shall be consecutively numbered for ease in identification;\n\n(5) the names and addresses of all defendants shall be given if known;\n\n(6) the estate to be taken shall be described;\n\n(7) in the event that title to the property to be taken is vested in the state, a statement that the board of finance has proclaimed that the needs and purposes of the condemnor to be of a greater public need than that of the defendant in whom the title is vested;\n\n(8) the petition shall be signed by any attorney employed by the state duly authorized to sign such pleadings;\n\n(9) the name of such attorney and his address or the post-office box number of the state shall appear below the signature, or both addresses may be given;\n\n(10) an allegation that the petitioner has been unable to agree with one or more of the defendants having an interest in a particular tract as to just compensation;\n\n(11) a statement of the amount offered as just compensation for each tract affected;\n\n(12) the petition shall include or have attached thereto a map, plat or plan of the improvement to be constructed and showing the property to be condemned.\n\nB.

A preliminary order permitting the state or any political subdivision thereof to immediately enter and occupy the premises sought to be condemned pending the action and to do such work thereon as may be required, may be obtained by the petitioner, without notice, upon the filing of the surety bond and deposit of money with the court as hereinafter provided, and a copy of such order shall be filed with the clerk of the court and notice thereof shall be served upon any defendant against whom such order is obtained, or upon his attorney of record. Such notice shall advise such defendant of the nature of the order and inform him that, unless objection thereto is filed within ten days after service thereof, the court shall deem such owner in default and shall proceed to make such preliminary order permanent and shall, without further notice, restrain said defendant from hindering or interfering with the occupation of the premises and the doing thereon of the work required, and that subsequent proceedings shall only affect the amount of compensation allowable.\n\nB. With his application for such preliminary order, the petitioner shall submit proof by affidavit, or otherwise, of the reasons for requiring a speedy occupation, and the court shall issue or refuse to issue the preliminary order according to the equity of the case and the relative damages which may accrue to the parties. If the order is granted, the court may require the petitioner to execute and file in the court a surety bond to the benefit of the defendants, executed by any surety company authorized to do business in the state, in a sum to be fixed by the court, but not less than the value of the premises for which possession is sought after taking into consideration the amount of the deposit, if any, and the damages which will result from such occupation and condemnation, as the same may appear to the court on the hearing, and conditioned to pay the adjudged value of the premises and all damages in case the property is condemned, and to pay all damages arising from the occupation before judgment in case the premises are not condemned. No order of entry to any property being taken from a private property owner for rights-of-way may be granted until there is deposited with the clerk of the district court the amount offered as just compensation. Money from this deposit shall be disbursed under such conditions as the court may deem appropriate, upon the demand of any person having an estate or interest in such property, and the final judgment shall not include interest from the date of said deposit on the amount of such advance deposit. Disbursements may be made only by order of court entered after expiration of the time for the filing of an answer. Any disbursement of money from an advance deposit shall be without prejudice to the right of a defendant landowner to litigate for additional compensation. The court or jury shall not award a lesser sum than that shown by the petitioner's appraised value testified to in court.\n\nC. Upon the filing of a certificate of the clerk of the court that ten days have elapsed since service of the notice of preliminary order on all defendants, the court, upon notice to all defendants who have appeared or their attorneys of record, may proceed to hear all legal objections to the petition and order, and all objections as to the amount of the bond, if any, and all argument as to why said order should not be made permanent, and shall thereupon make such order as it deems necessary. After said order is made permanent, all subsequent proceedings shall only affect the amount of compensation allowable.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 22-9-43, enacted by Laws 1959, ch. 324, § 5; 1966, ch. 40, § 1.\n\nEmergency clauses.— Laws 1966, ch. 40, § 2 contained an emergency clause and was approved March 1, 1966.\n\nProcedure provides for permanent order permitting condemnor to enterand occupy the premises and perform work thereon, after which \"subsequent proceedings shall only affect the amount of compensation allowable.\"State ex rel.

Burks, 1968-NMSC-121, 79 N.M. 373, 443 P.2d 866.\n\nRight to possession vests in condemnor on date of taking.— Clearly and logically the date of taking, whether partial or whole, was the date on which the condemnor became vested with the legal right to possession, dominion and control over the real estate being condemned.State ex rel. State Hwy. Dep't v. Yurcic, 1973-NMSC-059, 85 N.M. 220, 511 P.2d 546.\n\nHowever, no taking occurs if preliminary order not made permanent.— Where the preliminary order of entry is never made permanent and there is no physical entry or disturbance of the plaintiff's possession, no taking occurs.State ex rel. State Hwy. Dep't v. Yurcic, 1973-NMSC-059, 85 N.M. 220, 511 P.2d 546.\n\nProceedings unilaterally abandoned anytime before final judgment.— A county can unilaterally abandon condemnation proceedings following the entry of a permanent order of entry, (in fact, anytime before the entry of a final judgment confirming the compensation award) subject to paying compensation for the temporary taking that occurred and other expenses necessary to do equity. In assessing these damages and expenses, however, the court shall not award any damages for any reduction in value to the property based solely on its relocation. Because there is no permanent taking of property, the owner has no right to any incidental damages to what would have otherwise been the remainder of the property.County of Bernalillo v. Morris, 1994-NMCA-038, 117 N.M. 398, 872 P.2d 371.\n\nCondemnation deposit cannot be used to cure any defaultunder the real estate sales contract.Trickey v. Zumwalt, 1971-NMSC-114, 83 N.M. 278, 491 P.2d 166.\n\nRight to appeal award after accepting payment.— The language in this section, preserving a condemnee's right to litigate for additional compensation after accepting an advance deposit, refers only to accepting amounts paid to the clerk prior to the granting of the order of entry; the condemnee's acceptance of the full amount awarded by the court as just compensation waives the condemnee's right to appeal.Board of Educ. v. Johnson, 1998-NMCA-048, 125 N.M. 91, 957 P.2d 76.\n\nTax liability of condemnee ends after condemnor enters.— The condemnee is not liable for taxes accruing after the condemnor has entered the land and destroyed any beneficial possession on the part of the condemnee. 1964 Op.

State Hwy. Comm'n v. Hesselden Inv. Co., 1972-NMSC-071, 84 N.M. 424, 504 P.2d 634.\n\nDate of taking is date preliminary order effective.— In a proceeding brought under the Special Alternative Condemnation Procedure, a preliminary order of entry permits the state or any political subdivision thereof to immediately enter and occupy the premises sought to be condemned pending the action and to do such work thereon as may be required. A preliminary order of entry, therefore, effectively vests the condemnor with possession, dominion, and control over the premises. Consequently, the date the preliminary order becomes effective is the proper date to use in assessing the value of property taken under the Special Alternative Condemnation Procedure and, therefore, in fixing the compensation to which the owner is constitutionally entitled.County of Dona Ana ex rel. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Bennett, 1994-NMSC-005, 116 N.M. 778, 867 P.2d 1160.\n\nDate of filing cannot be date of taking.— The legislature's selection of the date of filing of the condemnation petition as the valuation date is impermissible because, as of that date, there has been no taking in the constitutional sense, i.e., vesting the legal right to possession of the property in the condemnor.County of Dona Ana ex rel. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Bennett, 1994-NMSC-005, 116 N.M. 778, 867 P.2d 1160.\n\nSpecial advantages to condemnor not proper consideration for damages.— Special advantages or value to the condemnor of the property taken is not a proper consideration in arriving at an award of damages to an owner.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Pelletier, 1966-NMSC-141, 76 N.M. 555, 417 P.2d 46;Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Vargas, 1966-NMSC-106, 76 N.M. 369, 415 P.2d 57.\n\nProjected use proper consideration.— The projected use of property to be considered as an element in arriving at value should be possible and probable, but must not be based upon mere speculation that at some time in the remote future a particular use might be made of the property.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Pelletier, 1966-NMSC-141, 76 N.M. 555, 417 P.2d 46.\n\nLoss based on unfounded fears.— In a partial condemnation action, a property owner is entitled to receive as compensation the diminution in value of the remainder of the property caused by public perception of the use to which the condemned property will be put. Under this view, compensation is awarded for loss of market value even if the loss is based on fears not founded on objective standards.City of Santa Fe v. Komis, 1992-NMSC-051, 114 N.M. 659, 845 P.2d 753.\n\nUse of earlier appraisal reports not barred.— There is no New Mexico law barring the introduction of appraisal reports made prior to the date of the original petition.State ex rel. State Hwy. Dep't v. First Nat'l Bank, 1977-NMSC-104, 91 N.M. 240, 572 P.2d 1248.\n\nFair market value of soil.— Where soil is taken in an eminent domain proceeding, fair market value is the measure of compensation and not the replacement cost of the soil.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Vargas, 1966-NMSC-106, 76 N.M. 369, 415 P.2d 57.\n\nInterest accrues from date owner's possession invaded.— The owner of land taken in condemnation proceedings should have interest from the time his possession is invaded, either with or without an order of the court.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Peace Found., Inc., 1968-NMSC-173, 79 N.M. 576, 446 P.2d 443.\n\nPayment of interest.— This section calls for interest to be paid on the unpaid balance of the original compensation awarded, but does not provide for interest to be paid on the interest accrued on the award with the filing of the judgment.State ex rel. State Hwy. Dep't v. First Nat'l Bank, 1977-NMSC-104, 91 N.M. 240, 572 P.2d 1248 (1977).\n\nWhere damages are awarded, interest will accrue at the rate of 6% on the unpaid portion of the principal from the date the petition in condemnation is filed until paid in full.State ex rel. State Hwy. Dep't v. First Nat'l Bank, 1977-NMSC-104, 91 N.M. 240, 572 P.2d 1248.\n\nSuspension of interest improper.— It is clear that Subsection B does not allow a trial court to suspend interest in condemnation proceedings under the Special Alternative Procedure Act.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Peace Found., Inc., 1968-NMSC-173, 79 N.M. 576, 446 P.2d 443.\n\nThe allowance of interest from the date the petition was filed is essential to just compensation and the trial court erred by suspending interest from date of continuance until jury verdict.State ex rel.

Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry., 1966-NMSC-146, 76 N.M. 587, 417 P.2d 68.\n\nJury instruction proper statement of law.— When there is a partial taking of a larger tract of land, the landowner's damages are measured by the value of the entire tract before the taking less the value of the remaining tract after the taking. N.M.U.J.I. Civ. 13-704 is thus a correct statement of law.County of Dona Ana ex rel. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Bennett, 1994-NMSC-005, 116 N.M. 778, 867 P.2d 1160.\n\nAmendment of petition by state, within trial court's discretion.— The trial court did not err in allowing the state to amend its petition where it did not change the date of valuation, only the extent of the condemnation on the valuation date. Amendments of pleadings are within the sound discretion of the trial court.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v.

Such persons may purchase such property at a price equal to the price paid for such excess property by the condemnor to the prior owner at the time of taking, plus interest at the rate of six percent per year, for the period beginning with the date the prior owner received final payment for the land taken, and ending when the notice of intent to dispose is mailed, less the amount of any liens which attached against the property while it was held by the condemnor.\n\nThe notice of intent to dispose shall be mailed to the last known address of the prior owner by certified mail with a return receipt requested. The notice shall notify the prior owner of his right to purchase, specify which portion of the property of the prior owner is available for purchase by him, the number of acres available, the amount of money, both the principal and interest it will require to repurchase it and the amount of any liens which may be deducted from the purchase price. If within thirty days after mailing the notice of intent to dispose, the prior owner or his personal representative or heirs elect to exercise the option to purchase, the condemnor shall enter into an agreement prepared and approved by the attorney general, if the condemnor is a state agency, and by appropriate legal officer of the entity if the condemnor is an entity other than a state agency for the sale of the surplus land to the prior owner, his personal representative or heirs.\n\nIf the prior owner, his personal representative or heirs have not elected to exercise the option within thirty days from the date of mailing the notice of intent to dispose, the condemnor shall sell the property at public sale.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 22-9-62, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 206, § 1; 1981, ch. 126, § 1.\n\nThe 1981 amendment,effective March 21, 1981, deleted \"and if such excess property exceeds one acre in size\" preceding \"the prior owner\" near the middle of the first sentence of the first undesignated paragraph, substituted \"the\" for \"an\" preceding \"option\" near the end of the first sentence of the first undesignated paragraph and substituted \"last known\" for \"last-known\" in the first sentence of the second undesignated paragraph.",
