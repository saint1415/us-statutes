      "text": "Chapter 74, Article 2 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Air Quality Control Act\".\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 12-14-1, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 277, § 1; 1972, ch. 51, § 1; 1989, ch. 278, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For the Environmental Improvement Act,seeChapter 74, Article 1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the Pollution Control Revenue Bond Act,seeChapter 3, Article 59 NMSA 1978.\n\nNew Mexico constitutional and statutory provisions have incorporated and implemented the common law public trust doctrine.— Section 21 of Article XX of the New Mexico Constitution recognizes that a public trust duty exists for the protection of New Mexico's natural resources, and it delegates the implementation of that specific duty to the legislature. The legislature has incorporated and implemented the common law public trust doctrine with regard to the process a person must follow in asserting his or her rights to protect the atmosphere by enacting the Air Quality Control Act, Chapter 74, Article 2 NMSA 1978, to address how protections for the atmosphere are implemented. The common law, where inconsistent with this statutory scheme, must yield to the governing statute. An individual may make a claim concerning the duty to protect the atmosphere, but such a claim must be raised within the existing constitutional and statutory framework and not alternatively through a separate cause of action, because a separate common law cause of action under the public trust doctrine would circumvent and render a nullity the process under the Air Quality Control Act that has established how competing interests are addressed and decisions are made regarding regulation of the atmosphere.Sanders-Reed v. Martinez, 2015-NMCA-063.\n\nWhere plaintiffs filed a civil complaint against the state of New Mexico seeking a judgment declaring that the common law public trust doctrine imposes a duty on the state to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in New Mexico, that the state's failure to devise a plan to mitigate the effects of climate change is a breach of the public trust duty, and that the state should be ordered to produce a plan for redressing and preventing the impairment to the atmosphere caused by greenhouse gases, summary judgment in favor of the state was appropriate where the legislature has enacted a statutory framework to address how protections for the atmosphere are implemented, and the common law, where inconsistent with the statutory scheme, must yield to the governing statute.Sanders-Reed v. Martinez, 2015-NMCA-063.\n\nComparison to Federal Clean Air Act.— New Mexico's Air Quality Control Act is not generally more stringent than the Federal Clean Air Act except in areas of air pollution prevention not preempted by the Federal Clean Air Act and not precluded by the limiting provisions in the Air Quality Control Act. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-11.\n\nApplication of state antipollution laws to industries located on Indian land is valid,provided that the operation of those laws neither impairs the proprietary interest of the Indian people in their lands nor limits the right of the tribe or pueblo to govern matters of tribal relations. The regulation of industrial discharges is not a matter fundamental to tribal relations, and the state supervision of environmental pollution will not limit, in any meaningful manner, the right of the several Indian peoples to govern themselves. The extension of pollution controls to industries located on Indian land will not affect the ownership or control of the land. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-05.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Delegation of Legislative Authority on the State Level; Environmental Protection in New Mexico: Public Service Co. of N.M. et al. v. N.M.

For Section 107 of that act,see42 U.S.C. § 7407.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, substituted \"listed\" for \"classified\" in Subsection H; and rewrote Subsection P, which formerly read \"'potential emission rate' means the emission rate of a source at its maximum capacity in the absence of air pollution control equipment that is not vital to production of the normal product of the source or to its normal operation;\".\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective March 5, 1992, deleted former Subsections C and D, defining \"board\" and \"delayed compliance order\"; rewrote former Subsection E and redesignated it as present Subsection C; redesignated former Subsection F as present Subsection D, while substituting therein \"a local agency\" for \"the department\"; redesignated former Subsection G as present Subsection E, while inserting therein \"environmental improvement board or the local\" and \"the local authority or the local agency\"; deleted former Subsection H, defining \"environmental improvement division\"; rewrote former Subsection I and redesignated it as present Subsection F; redesignated former Subsections J and K as present Subsections G and H; added present Subsections I, J and K; inserted \"environmental improvement board or the local\" in Subsection M(3); rewrote Subsection N; added present Subsection R; redesignated former Subsections R through U as present Subsections S through V; added Subsection W; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nBoard may not expand definition of \"air pollution\"from \"reasonable probability\" of injury to health to a mere showing that condition \"tends to cause harm.\"Duke City Lumber Co. v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 1984-NMSC-042, 101 N.M. 291, 681 P.2d 717.\n\nAir Quality Standards' margin of safety does not contemplate excursions beyond legal limits.— Petitioner's argument that Congress, by allowing an adequate margin of safety, not only contemplated but countenanced occasional excursions beyond the limits of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards is meritless since it is clear that the margin of safety protects against effects which have not yet been uncovered by research or whose medical significance is a matter of disagreement.Duke City Lumber Co. v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 1984-NMCA-058, 102 N.M. 8, 690 P.2d 451.\n\nBoard may rely on division's modeling results to deny variance application.— The environmental improvement board may rely on the environmental improvement division's modeling results, showing particulate concentrations in excess of the legal limit, in arriving at its decision to deny a lumber company's application for a variance from air quality control regulations.Duke City Lumber Co. v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 1984-NMCA-058, 102 N.M. 8, 690 P.2d 451.\n\nApplication of reasonable probability of injury standard not required during permitting process.— Where the city of Albuquerque environmental health department (EHD) issued an authority-to-construct permit to an oil company pursuant to the New Mexico Air Quality Control Act (AQCA), 74-2-1 to 74-2-17 NMSA 1978, and where the Albuquerque-Bernalillo county air quality control board (board) upheld the EHD's issuance of the permit, and where plaintiff appealed the board's order, claiming that EHD and the board each failed to apply a \"reasonable probability of injury\" standard when evaluating the permit, the board did not err in upholding EHD's issuance of the authority-to-construct permit, because 74-2-7 NMSA 1978 directs EHD and the board to determine whether local, state, and federal air pollution standards or federal regulations have been violated, but does not impose on EHD or the board a requirement to independently apply the reasonable probability of injury standard when considering whether to grant a permit.Southwest Organizing Project v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Air Quality Control Bd., 2021-NMCA-005.\n\nRequirement to consider community testimony met during permitting process.— Where the city of Albuquerque environmental health department (EHD) issued an authority-to-construct permit to an oil company pursuant to the New Mexico Air Quality Control Act (AQCA), 74-2-1 to 74-2-17 NMSA 1978, and where the Albuquerque-Bernalillo county air quality control board (board) upheld the EHD's issuance of the permit, and where plaintiff appealed the board's order, claiming that EHD, during the application process, and the board, at the later adjudicatory hearing, were required to consider community testimony regarding the oil company's effect on local resident quality of life, the board did not err in upholding EHD's issuance of the authority-to-construct permit, because EHD, during the initial application process, met the public comment requirement by holding a public information hearing, accepting pubic testimony about concerns for quality of life, and addressing written comments submitted before and during the hearing, and the board, during the hearings following the petition of EHD's decision to grant the permit, similarly permitted public testimony. EHD and the board, however, were not required to specifically address public testimony regarding quality of life issues in resolving the permit application.Southwest Organizing Project v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Air Quality Control Bd., 2021-NMCA-005.\n\nPublic nuisance laws deemed alternative means of enforcement.— Where air quality standards or regulations have not been established as to what constitutes \"air pollution\" and thus no violation of this article or regulations and standards is apparent, New Mexico's public nuisance law may provide an alternative means for the environmental improvement division to abate noxious odors. 1978 Op.

A county or municipality meeting the qualifications set forth in Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection J of Section 74-2-2 NMSA 1978 may assume jurisdiction as a local authority by adopting an ordinance providing for the local administration and enforcement of the Air Quality Control Act. The ordinance shall:\n\n(1) create a local board to perform, within the boundaries of the local authority, those functions delegated to the environmental improvement board under the Air Quality Control Act, except any functions reserved exclusively for the environmental improvement board;\n\n(2) create a local agency to administer and enforce the provisions of the Air Quality Control Act within the boundaries of the local authority that shall, within the boundaries of the local authority, perform all of the duties required of the department and exert all of the powers granted to the department, except for those duties and powers reserved exclusively for the department; and\n\n(3) provide for the appointment of a director who shall perform for the local authority the same duties as required of the secretary under the Air Quality Control Act, except the duties and powers reserved exclusively for the secretary.\n\nB. At least a majority of the members of a local board shall be individuals who represent the public interest and do not derive any significant portion of their income from persons subject to or who appear before the local board on issues related to the federal act or the Air Quality Control Act.\n\nC. Prior to adopting any ordinance regulating air pollution, public hearings and consultations shall be held as directed by the local authority adopting the ordinance. The provisions of any ordinance shall be consistent with the substantive provisions of the Air Quality Control Act and shall provide for standards and regulations not lower than those required by regulations adopted by the environmental improvement board.\n\nD. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A of this section, the environmental improvement board and the secretary shall retain jurisdiction and control for the administration and enforcement of the Air Quality Control Act as determined in that act with respect to any act or failure to act, governmental or proprietary, of any local authority that causes or contributes to air pollution, including proceeding against a local authority as provided in Section 74-2-12 NMSA 1978. \"Failure to act\", as used in this section, includes failure to act against any person violating the applicable ordinance or regulation adopted pursuant thereto.\n\nE. Any local authority that is located within a transportation-related pollutant nonattainment area or maintenance area may provide for a vehicle emission inspection and maintenance program for vehicles registered at an address within the jurisdiction of the local authority and under twenty-six thousand pounds gross vehicle weight rating powered by an internal combustion engine, which program shall be at least as stringent as that required under the federal act or under federal air quality standards. Any two or more local authorities may adopt identical rules and regulations necessary to implement the vehicle emission inspection and maintenance program, including examining the alternatives of public or private operation of the program.\n\nF. Any local authority that has implemented a vehicle emission inspection and maintenance program may extend the enforcement of that program by entering into joint powers agreements with any municipality or county within the designated airshed or with the department.\n\nG. No tax shall be imposed to fund any vehicle emission inspection and maintenance program until the local authority has submitted the question of imposition of a tax to the registered voters of the local authority and those registered voters have approved the imposition of the tax.\n\nH. A local authority having a vehicle emission inspection and maintenance program shall conduct the vehicle emission inspection and maintenance program through a decentralized privately owned and operated system unless air quality emissions result in automatic implementation of another type of program under the terms of a contingency plan required and approved by the United States environmental protection agency. The local authority shall set the emission inspection fee by ordinance.\n\nI. A local authority having a vehicle emission inspection and maintenance program is authorized to adopt rules, regulations and guidelines governing the establishment of private vehicle emission inspection and maintenance stations. No private vehicle emission inspection and maintenance station shall test vehicles unless the station possesses a valid permit issued by the local agency. Permit fees shall be determined by ordinance of the local authority and shall not exceed two hundred dollars ($200) per year per station. Additionally, a local authority may charge a permit fee of up to thirty-five dollars ($35.00) per year for each vehicle emissions mechanic and for each vehicle emissions inspector. The imposition of permit fees does not require a vote of the registered voters of the local authority.\n\nJ. Before a local authority adopts an ordinance that is more stringent than the federal act or applicable federal regulations, or that applies to sources not subject to regulation pursuant to the federal act or regulations, the local authority shall make a determination, based on substantial evidence and after notice and public hearing, that the proposed ordinance will be more protective of public health and the environment.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 12-14-4, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 277, § 4; 1970, ch. 58, § 3; 1971, ch. 277, § 22; 1973, ch. 322, § 3; 1981, ch. 373, § 2; 1985, ch. 95, § 1; 1988, ch. 128, § 1; 1989, ch. 278, § 3; 1990, ch. 31, § 2; 1992, ch. 20, § 3; 1994, ch. 131, § 1; 1995, ch. 128, § 1; 2021, ch. 133, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For definition of \"class A county,\"see4-44-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the meaning of \"federal act\",seeParagraph F of 74-2-2 NMSA 1978 and notes thereto.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective July 1, 2021, required that a local authority's decision to adopt an ordinance regulating air pollution that is more stringent than the federal act or applicable federal regulations, or that applies to sources not subject to regulation pursuant to the federal act or regulations, be based on substantial evidence after notice and public hearing, and clarified provisions of the section; in Subsection E, after \"maintenance program for vehicles\", added \"registered at an address within the jurisdiction of the local authority and\", after \"gross vehicle weight\", added \"rating\", and after \"program shall be\", deleted \"no more\" and added \"at least as\"; and added Subsection J.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, inserted \"or maintenance area\" in the first sentence in Subsection E, and deleted \"contiguous\" preceding \"municipality\" in Subsection F.\n\nThe 1994 amendment,effective May 18, 1994, rewrote Subsection H, which read: \"No vehicle emission inspection fee may be imposed by a local authority that exceeds two dollars ($2.00) for each vehicle subject to an emission inspection and maintenance program. The above fee limitation shall not limit any charges for vehicle inspections by a private vehicle emission inspection and maintenance station.\"\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective March 5, 1992, rewrote this section to the extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nLocalities may impose criminal penalties for violations of act.— This article does not expressly deny to counties and municipalities the power to impose criminal penalties for violations of the act, thus such penalties are valid under N.M.

Thomas, 789 F.2d 825 (10th Cir. 1986).\n\nAdoption of environmental justice principles.— The Albuquerque-Bernalillo county air quality control board has the authority to promulgate regulations that incorporate environmental justice principles, which provide that a government agency should notify the public, and factor in public testimony regarding a company's environmental impact on the community, particularly in a minority or impoverished community, prior to issuing a permit to that company, and to adopt directives requiring that environmental justice principles be incorporated into staff work, but those directives do not have a binding effect on the parties in the permitting process. 2008 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 08-03.\n\nAir pollution controlled by subjecting entire state to regulatory authority.— Under this article, air pollution throughout the state is controlled by subjecting every area of the state to the regulatory authority of some board: either the environmental improvement board or a board created in accordance with this section. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-07.\n\nMunicipality not exempt from regulations adopted by county board.— Section 4-37-2 NMSA 1978 does not exempt a municipality from regulations adopted by a county air quality control board which has the authority to adopt regulations to prevent or abate air pollution within the geographic boundaries of that county. 1982 Op.

      "text": "A. The environmental improvement board or the local board shall prevent or abate air pollution.\n\nB. The environmental improvement board or the local board shall:\n\n(1) adopt, promulgate, publish, amend and repeal rules and standards consistent with the Air Quality Control Act to attain and maintain national ambient air quality standards and prevent or abate air pollution, including:\n\n(a) rules prescribing air standards within the geographic area of the environmental improvement board's jurisdiction or the local board's jurisdiction or any part thereof; and\n\n(b) standards of performance that limit carbon dioxide emissions to no more than one thousand one hundred pounds per megawatt-hour on and after January 1, 2023 for a new or existing source that is an electric generating facility with an original installed capacity exceeding three hundred megawatts and that uses coal as a fuel source; and\n\n(2) adopt a plan for the regulation, control, prevention or abatement of air pollution, recognizing the differences, needs, requirements and conditions within the geographic area of the environmental improvement board's jurisdiction or the local board's jurisdiction or any part thereof.\n\nC. If the environmental improvement board or the local board determines that emissions from sources within the environmental improvement board's jurisdiction or the local board's jurisdiction cause or contribute to ozone concentrations in excess of ninety-five percent of the primary national ambient air quality standard for ozone promulgated pursuant to the federal act, the environmental improvement board or the local board shall adopt a plan, including rules, to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds to provide for attainment and maintenance of the standard. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection shall be limited to sources of emissions within the area of the state where the ozone concentrations exceed ninety-five percent of the primary national ambient air quality standard.\n\nD. Rules adopted by the environmental improvement board or the local board may:\n\n(1) include rules to protect visibility in mandatory class I areas to prevent significant deterioration of air quality and to achieve national ambient air quality standards in nonattainment areas; provided that the rules shall be at least as stringent as required by the federal act and federal regulations pertaining to visibility protection in mandatory class I areas, pertaining to prevention of significant deterioration and pertaining to nonattainment areas;\n\n(2) prescribe standards of performance for sources and emission standards for hazardous air pollutants that shall be at least as stringent as required by federal standards of performance;\n\n(3) include rules governing emissions from solid waste incinerators that shall be at least as stringent as any applicable federal emission limitations;\n\n(4) include rules requiring the installation of control technology for mercury emissions that removes the greater of what is achievable with best available control technology or ninety percent of the mercury from the input fuel for all coal-fired power plants, except for coal-fired power plants constructed and generating electric power and energy before July 1, 2007;\n\n(5) require notice to the department or the local agency of the intent to introduce or permit the introduction of an air contaminant into the air within the geographical area of the environmental improvement board's jurisdiction or the local board's jurisdiction; and\n\n(6) require any person emitting any air contaminant to:\n\n(a) install, use and maintain emission monitoring devices;\n\n(b) sample emissions in accordance with methods and at locations and intervals as may be prescribed by the environmental improvement board or the local board;\n\n(c) establish and maintain records of the nature and amount of emissions;\n\n(d) submit reports regarding the nature and amounts of emissions and the performance of emission control devices; and\n\n(e) provide any other reasonable information relating to the emission of air contaminants.\n\nE. Any rule adopted pursuant to this section shall be at least as stringent as federal law, if any, relating to control of motor vehicle emissions.\n\nF. In making its rules, the environmental improvement board or the local board shall give weight it deems appropriate to all facts and circumstances, including:\n\n(1) character and degree of injury to or interference with health, welfare, visibility and property;\n\n(2) the public interest, including the social and economic value of the sources and subjects of air contaminants; and\n\n(3) technical practicability and economic reasonableness of reducing or eliminating air contaminants from the sources involved and previous experience with equipment and methods available to control the air contaminants involved.\n\nG. Before the environmental improvement board or local board adopts a rule that is more stringent than the federal act or federal regulations, or that applies to sources not subject to regulation pursuant to the federal act or regulations, the environmental improvement board or local board shall make a determination, based on substantial evidence and after notice and public hearing, that the proposed rule will be more protective of public health and the environment.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 12-14-5, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 277, § 5; 1970, ch. 58, § 4; 1972, ch. 51, § 3; 1979, ch. 393, § 2; 1981, ch. 373, § 3; 1983, ch. 34, § 2; 1987, ch. 293, § 1; 1990, ch. 99, § 66; 1992, ch. 20, § 4; 2007, ch. 143, § 1; 2019, ch. 65, § 36; 2021, ch. 133, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For definitions of \"board\" and \"federal act,\"see74-2-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective July 1, 2021, provided that if there is a determination that emissions from sources within the environmental improvement board's or local board's jurisdiction cause or contribute to ozone concentrations in excess of ninety-five percent of the primary national ambient air quality standard for ozone promulgated pursuant to the federal act, the environmental improvement board or the local board must adopt a plan to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds to provide for attainment and maintenance of the standard, and removed provisions prohibiting the environmental improvement board and the local board from adopting certain types of state air quality regulations and standards more stringent than federal regulations and standards; added new Subsection C and redesignated former Subsections C through E as Subsection D through F, respectively; in Subsection D, Paragraph D(1), after \"shall be\", deleted \"no more stringent than but\", and deleted Subparagraph D(1)(b), Paragraph D(2), after \"hazardous air pollutants that\", deleted \"except as provided in this subsection and in Subparagraph (b) of Paragraph (1) of Subsection B of this section\", after \"shall be\", deleted \"no more stringent than but\", and deleted former Subparagraph D(2)(b), in Paragraph D(3), after \"as stringent as\", deleted \"and may be more stringent than\"; in Subsection E, after \"this section shall be\", deleted \"consistent with\" and added \"at least as stringent as\"; and added Subsection G.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective June 14, 2019, required the environmental improvement board to promulgate rules and standards of performance that limit carbon dioxide emissions to no more than 1,100 lbs. per megawatt-hour on and after January 1, 2023 for electric facilities with an original installed capacity exceeding 300 megawatts and that uses coal as a fuel source; in Subsection B, Paragraph B(1), after \"repeal\", deleted \"regulations\" and added \"rules and standards\", added new subparagraph designation \"(a)\", in Subparagraph B(1)(a), added \"rules\", and added Subparagraph B(1)(b); and in Subsection C, replaced \"regulations\" with \"rules\", and in Paragraph C(2), after \"as provided in this subsection\", added \"and in Subparagraph (b) of Paragraph (1) of Subsection B of this section\".\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, added Paragraph (4) of Subsection C providing the installation of control technology for mercury emissions for coal power plants other than those generating energy before July 1, 2007.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective March 5, 1992, substituted the present section catchline for \"Duties and powers of board\"; inserted \"environmental improvement board\" in Subsection A, rewrote the provisions of former Subsection B and redesignated them as present Subsections B, C, and D; and deleted former Subsections C, D, and E, relating to notice of intent to introduce air contaminants, compacts with other states, and installation of monitoring devices, samples, records, and reports respectively.\n\nBoard's authority limited to pollution control.— Administrative bodies are the creatures of statutes, and as such they have no common-law or inherent powers and can act only as to those matters which are within the scope of the authority delegated to them. The legislative mandate under this article is that the board should prevent or abate air pollution, and although the authority granted to an administrative agency should be construed so as to permit the fullest accomplishment of the legislative intent or policy, such an approach to construction does not warrant allowing an administrative agency to amend or enlarge its authority under the guise of making rules and regulations.Public Serv. Co. v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 1976-NMCA-039, 89 N.M. 223, 549 P.2d 638.\n\nNo authority to plan industrial development.— There is nothing in the board's mandate that gives it the authority to plan for the industrial development of any area in the state; although the standards and regulations promulgated by the board will have an impact on the industrial development of the area, such an impact should be as a consequence, not by design.Public Serv. Co. v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 1976-NMCA-039, 89 N.M. 223, 549 P.2d 638.\n\nNo authority to require more restrictive standards than federal regulations.— There is no authority given to the board to promulgate regulations more restrictive than those under federal law in order for New Mexico to regain control over its air.Public Serv. Co. v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 1976-NMCA-039, 89 N.M. 223, 549 P.2d 638.\n\nBoard's regulation following federal requirements not automatically illegal.— The board's adoption of a regulation which adheres to federal requirements does not create the automatic conclusion that it has ignored its obligations under state law.Kennecott Copper Corp. v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 1980-NMCA-007, 94 N.M. 610, 614 P.2d 22, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 675, 615 P.2d 992.\n\nSubstantial evidence required to support regulations.— There is no substantial evidence in the record to support one of the board's final reasons for adopting amended regulations as to sulfur dioxide emissions, namely, because of their effects on visibility, since by definition sulfur dioxide in a gaseous form is a heavy colorless nonflammable gas of pungent suffocating odor, and whether sulfur dioxide emissions can or do combine with other elements in the atmosphere to produce a visible gas, or whatever, is not shown in the record.Public Serv. Co. v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 1976-NMCA-039, 89 N.M. 223, 549 P.2d 638.\n\nSubstantial evidence not required for every particular.— Regulations adopted by a board, pursuant to this section after substantial compliance with the public hearing requirements, need not be supported by substantial evidence in every material portion thereof.Wylie Bros. Contracting Co. v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Air Quality Control Bd., 1969-NMCA-089, 80 N.M. 633, 459 P.2d 159.\n\nBoard bound by its standard.— The board, in promulgating an ambient air quality standard, establishes the criterion for determining what concentration or quantity of sulfur dioxide in the specified time periods constitutes air pollution; it makes the judgment that concentrations over the quantity prescribed would injure health, interfere with visibility and adversely affect the public welfare. Having set the standard, it is bound by it, the same as anyone else.Public Serv. Co. v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 1976-NMCA-039, 89 N.M. 223, 549 P.2d 638.\n\nModification authorized to prevent pollution.— The board has the continuing authority to change the ambient air quality standard for sulfur dioxide after proper notice and hearing and to adopt regulations to implement or explain it, but it may not set a new standard or adopt regulations implementing or explaining it for any reason other than to prevent or abate air pollution.Public Serv. Co. v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 1976-NMCA-039, 89 N.M. 223, 549 P.2d 638.\n\nBoard obligated to amend standards to comply with federal requirements.— When New Mexico standards are amended and thus made more stringent in order to comply with federal requirements, the board is doing no more than it is obliged to do by its mandate under the federal Clean Air Act.Kennecott Copper Corp. v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 1980-NMCA-007, 94 N.M. 610, 614 P.2d 22, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 675, 615 P.2d 992.\n\nApplication of reasonable probability of injury standard not required during permitting process.— Where the city of Albuquerque environmental health department (EHD) issued an authority-to-construct permit to an oil company pursuant to the New Mexico Air Quality Control Act (AQCA), 74-2-1 to 74-2-17 NMSA 1978, and where the Albuquerque-Bernalillo county air quality control board (board) upheld the EHD's issuance of the permit, and where plaintiff appealed the board's order, claiming that EHD and the board each failed to apply a \"reasonable probability of injury\" standard when evaluating the permit, the board did not err in upholding EHD's issuance of the authority-to-construct permit, because 74-2-7 NMSA 1978 directs EHD and the board to determine whether local, state, and federal air pollution standards or federal regulations have been violated, but does not impose on EHD or the board a requirement to independently apply the reasonable probability of injury standard when considering whether to grant a permit.Southwest Organizing Project v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Air Quality Control Bd., 2021-NMCA-005.\n\nRequirement to consider community testimony met during permitting process.— Where the city of Albuquerque environmental health department (EHD) issued an authority-to-construct permit to an oil company pursuant to the New Mexico Air Quality Control Act (AQCA), 74-2-1 to 74-2-17 NMSA 1978, and where the Albuquerque-Bernalillo county air quality control board (board) upheld the EHD's issuance of the permit, and where plaintiff appealed the board's order, claiming that EHD, during the application process, and the board, at the later adjudicatory hearing, were required to consider community testimony regarding the oil company's effect on local resident quality of life, the board did not err in upholding EHD's issuance of the authority-to-construct permit, because EHD, during the initial application process, met the public comment requirement by holding a public information hearing, accepting pubic testimony about concerns for quality of life, and addressing written comments submitted before and during the hearing, and the board, during the hearings following the petition of EHD's decision to grant the permit, similarly permitted public testimony. EHD and the board, however, were not required to specifically address public testimony regarding quality of life issues in resolving the permit application.Southwest Organizing Project v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Air Quality Control Bd., 2021-NMCA-005.\n\nResponsibility for enforcing act.— Enforcement of New Mexico regulations and standards more stringent than, or in addition to, the federal standards and regulations is the state's responsibility; the environmental improvement board has state-wide responsibility for enforcing this article, but the Albuquerque-Bernalillo county air quality control board has this responsibility in the Albuquerque-Bernalillo county area. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-11.\n\nRequiring use of oxygenated fuels.— The environmental improvement board and/or the Albuquerque-Bernalillo county air quality control board may require the use of oxygenated fuels without violating the constitutional prohibition against interference with interstate commerce, but may only do so if that requirement is contained in the state's implementation plan. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-11.\n\nUpon showing of present or future need for new standard.— New emission regulations may be adopted by the board if there is substantial evidence in the record of a present or reasonably anticipated future need for a stricter regulation in order to prevent air pollution in excess of the standard. Thus, if the board can demonstrate that reasonably anticipated future growth in the area will, as a factual matter, result in pollution emissions which exceed present ambient air standards, the board may enact stricter regulations for both existing and proposed sources. The board may act to prevent or abate air pollution when presented with persuasive evidence that emission sources are growing in number and that the totality of new and existing emissions will, if left at presently regulated rates, exceed the ambient air quality standard. 1977 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 77-15.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Delegation of Legislative Authority on the State Level; Environmental Protection in New Mexico: Public Service Co. of New Mexico et al. v.

No regulations or emission control requirement adopted by the environmental improvement board or the local board shall become effective until thirty days after its filing under the State Rules Act [Chapter 14, Article 4 NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 12-14-6, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 277, § 6; 1970, ch. 58, § 5; 1974, ch. 64, § 2; 1981, ch. 373, § 4; 1982, ch. 73, § 25; 1992, ch. 20, § 7.\n\nCross references.— For definition of \"board\",see74-2-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor notice by publication,see14-11-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective March 5, 1992, substituted \"adoption\" for \"promulgation\" in the first sentence of Subsection A, substituted \"environmental improvement board or the local board\" for \"board\" several times throughout the section, deleted former Subsection G relating to appeals, and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 1992, ch. 20, § 22, effective March 5, 1992, provides that all rules, regulations and administrative determinations of the environmental improvement board or a local board created by any local air quality authority and the department of environment or the administrative agency of a local air quality authority pertaining to air quality that existed prior to the effective date of the 1992 amendments to the Air Quality Control Act (March 5, 1992) set forth in that act shall remain in effect after that date until repealed or amended unless in conflict with, prohibited by or inconsistent with, the provisions of the Air Quality Control Act, as amended, and provides that all enforcement actions taken before or after the effective date of the amendments to the Air Quality Control Act (March 5, 1992) set forth in this 1992 act shall be valid if based upon an act or failure to act that violated a provision of law or regulation in effect at the time of the act or failure to act.\n\nProduction at hearing of supporting substantial evidence not required.— An adjudicatory or trial-type hearing is not contemplated by this section; the validity of a regulation is not dependent upon support by substantial evidence adduced at a hearing.Wylie Bros. Contracting Co. v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Air Quality Control Bd., 1969-NMCA-089, 80 N.M. 633, 459 P.2d 159.\n\nNotice and hearing prerequisite to granting variance.— The environmental improvement board cannot grant a variance without first having given the public reasonable notice and a hearing on the contemplated variance. Where the notice of the hearing on a proposed amendment contains no mention of a variance, the board cannot legally grant a variance after the hearing. The order granting the variance is, therefore, void. 1976 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 76-23.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 61A Am.

By regulation, the environmental improvement board or the local board shall require:\n\n(1) a person intending to construct or modify any source, except as otherwise specifically provided by regulation, to obtain a construction permit from the department or the local agency prior to such construction or modification; and\n\n(2) a person intending to operate any source for which an operating permit is required by the 1990 amendments to the federal act, except as otherwise specifically provided by regulation, to obtain an operating permit from the department or the local agency.\n\nB. Regulations adopted by the environmental improvement board or the local board shall include at least the following provisions:\n\n(1) requirements for the submission of relevant information, including information the department or the local agency deems necessary to determine that regulations and standards under the Air Quality Control Act or the federal act will not be violated;\n\n(2) specification of the deadlines for processing permit applications; provided that the deadline for a final decision by the department or the local agency on a construction permit application may not exceed:\n\n(a) ninety days after the application is determined to be administratively complete, if the application is not subject to requirements for prevention of significant deterioration, unless the secretary or the director grants an extension not to exceed ninety days for good cause, including the need to have public hearings; or\n\n(b) one hundred eighty days after the application is determined to be administratively complete, if the application is subject to requirements for prevention of significant deterioration, unless the secretary or the director grants an extension not to exceed ninety days for good cause, including the need to have public hearings;\n\n(3) that if the department or local agency fails to take final action on a construction permit application within the deadlines specified in Paragraph (2) of this subsection, the department or local agency shall notify the applicant in writing that an extension of time is required to process the application and specify in detail the grounds for the extension;\n\n(4) a description of elements required before the department or local agency shall deem an application administratively complete;\n\n(5) specification of the public notice, comment period and public hearing, if any, required prior to the issuance of a permit; provided that the permit regulations adopted:\n\n(a) by the environmental improvement board shall include provisions governing notice to nearby states; and\n\n(b) by any local board shall include provisions requiring that notice be given to the department of all permit applications by any source that emits, or has a potential emission rate of, one hundred tons per year or more of any regulated air contaminant, including any source of fugitive emissions of each regulated air contaminant, at least sixty days prior to the date on which construction or major modification is to commence;\n\n(6) a schedule of construction permit fees sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of:\n\n(a) reviewing and acting upon any application for such permit; and\n\n(b) implementing and enforcing the terms and conditions of the permit, excluding any court costs or other costs associated with an enforcement action;\n\n(7) a schedule of emission fees consistent with the provisions of Section 502(b)(3) of the 1990 amendments to the federal act;\n\n(8) a method for accelerated permit processing that may be requested at the sole discretion of the applicant at the time the applicant submits a construction permit application and that:\n\n(a) allows the department or local agency to contract with qualified outside firms to assist the department or local agency in its accelerated review of the construction permit application; provided that the department or local agency can contract with a qualified firm that does not have a conflict of interest; and\n\n(b) establishes a process for the department or local agency to account for the expenditure of the accelerated permit processing fees;\n\n(9) allowance for additional permit application fees, sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of an accelerated permit application review process. Before the applicant is notified that the permit application has been determined to be complete, the department or local agency shall give the applicant a reasonable estimate of costs of an accelerated permit application review process;\n\n(10) specification of the maximum length of time for which a permit shall be valid; provided that for an operating permit such period may not exceed five years; and\n\n(11) for an operating permit only:\n\n(a) provisions consistent with Sections 502(b) and 505(b) of the federal act providing: 1) notice to and review and comment by the United States environmental protection agency; and 2) that if the department or local agency receives notice of objection from the United States environmental protection agency before the operating permit is issued, the department or the local agency shall not issue the permit unless it is revised and issued under Section 505(c) of the federal act;\n\n(b) provisions governing renewal of the operating permit; and\n\n(c) specification of the conditions under which the operating permit may be terminated, modified or revoked and reissued prior to the expiration of the term of the operating permit.\n\nC. Except as provided in Subsection O of this section, the department or the local agency may deny any application for:\n\n(1) a construction permit if it appears that the construction or modification:\n\n(a) will not meet applicable standards, rules or requirements of the Air Quality Control Act or the federal act;\n\n(b) will cause or contribute to air contaminant levels in excess of a national or state standard or, within the boundaries of a local authority, applicable local ambient air quality standards; or\n\n(c) will violate any other provision of the Air Quality Control Act or the federal act; and\n\n(2) an operating permit if the source will not meet the applicable standards, rules or requirements pursuant to the Air Quality Control Act or the federal act.\n\nD. The department or the local agency may specify conditions to any permit granted under this section, including:\n\n(1) for a construction permit:\n\n(a) a requirement that such source install and operate control technology, determined on a case-by-case basis, sufficient to meet the standards, rules and requirements of the Air Quality Control Act and the federal act;\n\n(b) individual emission limits, determined on a case-by-case basis, but only as restrictive as necessary to meet the requirements of the Air Quality Control Act and the federal act or the emission rate specified in the permit application, whichever is more stringent;\n\n(c) compliance with applicable federal standards of performance;\n\n(d) reasonable restrictions and limitations not relating to emission limits or emission rates; or\n\n(e) any combination of the conditions listed in this paragraph; and\n\n(2) for an operating permit, terms and conditions sufficient to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, rules and requirements pursuant to the Air Quality Control Act and the federal act.\n\nE. This section does not authorize the department or the local agency to require the use of machinery, devices or equipment from a particular manufacturer if the federal standards of performance, state regulations and permit conditions may be met by machinery, devices or equipment otherwise available.\n\nF. The issuance of a permit does not relieve any person from the responsibility of complying with the provisions of the Air Quality Control Act and any applicable regulations of the environmental improvement board or the local board. Any conditions placed upon a permit by the department or the local agency shall be enforceable to the same extent as a regulation of its board.\n\nG. A person who participated in a permitting action before the department or the local agency shall be notified by the department or the local agency of the action taken and the reasons for the action. Notification of the applicant shall be by certified mail.\n\nH. A person who participated in a permitting action before the department or the local agency and who is adversely affected by such permitting action may file a petition for hearing before the environmental improvement board or the local board. The petition shall be made in writing to the environmental improvement board or the local board within thirty days from the date notice is given of the department's or the local agency's action. Unless a timely petition for hearing is made, the decision of the department or the local agency shall be final.\n\nI. If a timely petition for hearing is made, the environmental improvement board or the local board shall hold a hearing within sixty days after receipt of the petition. The environmental improvement board or the local board shall notify the petitioner and the applicant or permittee, if other than the petitioner, by certified mail of the date, time and place of the hearing. If the subject of the petition is a permitting action deemed by the environmental improvement board or the local board to substantially affect the public interest, the environmental improvement board or the local board shall ensure that the public receives notice of the date, time and place of the hearing. The public in such circumstances shall also be given a reasonable opportunity to submit data, views or arguments orally or in writing and to examine witnesses testifying at the hearing. Any person submitting data, views or arguments orally or in writing shall be subject to examination at the hearing.\n\nJ. The environmental improvement board or the local board may designate a hearing officer to take evidence in the hearing. All hearings shall be recorded.\n\nK. The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner. Based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, the environmental improvement board or the local board shall sustain, modify or reverse the action of the department or the local agency respectively.\n\nL. Notwithstanding any other provision of law and subject to the provisions of Section 74-2-4 NMSA 1978, a final decision on a permit by the department, the environmental improvement board, the local agency, the local board or the court of appeals that a source will or will not meet applicable local, state and federal air pollution standards and regulations shall be conclusive and is binding on every other state agency and as an issue before any other state agency shall be deemed resolved in accordance with that final decision.\n\nM. Subject to the provisions of Section 74-2-4 NMSA 1978, if the local board has adopted a permit regulation pursuant to this section, persons constructing or modifying any source within the boundaries of the local authority shall obtain a permit from the local agency and not from the department.\n\nN. Fees collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in:\n\n(1) the state air quality permit fund created by Section 74-2-15 NMSA 1978 if collected by the department; or\n\n(2) a fund created pursuant to Section 74-2-16 NMSA 1978 if collected by a local agency pursuant to a permit regulation adopted by the local board pursuant to this section.\n\nO. The department may not deny an application for a construction permit for a cotton gin if the applicant proposes use of the best system of emissions reduction currently in use by cotton gins in the United States, as specified by regulation of the environmental improvement board, and the cotton gin has a potential emission rate, considering the use of the proposed emissions reduction system and the proposed hours of operation, of not more than fifty tons per year of any regulated air contaminant for which there is a national ambient air quality standard. The construction permit shall require that the applicant use the proposed emission reduction system and limit the hours of operation to the hours specified in the application. For purposes of this subsection, \"best system of emissions reduction\" for cotton gins means a system that will result in emissions reduction equal to or greater than that obtained by the use of condenser screens, seventy-mesh screen or equivalent on low-pressure exhausts and high-efficiency cyclone dust collectors on high-pressure exhausts.\n\nP. The department or local agency may deny any permit application or revoke any permit issued pursuant to the Air Quality Control Act if, within ten years immediately preceding the date of submission of the permit application, the applicant or permittee has:\n\n(1) knowingly misrepresented a material fact in an application for a permit;\n\n(2) refused to disclose the information required by the provisions of the Air Quality Control Act;\n\n(3) been convicted in any court of any state or the United States of:\n\n(a) a felony related to environmental crime; or\n\n(b) a crime defined by state or federal statute as involving or being in restraint of trade, price fixing, bribery or fraud;\n\n(4) constructed or operated a facility for which a permit is sought without a permit required by the Air Quality Control Act, except when such an unpermitted facility is discovered after acquisition in the course of a timely environmental audit authorized by department or local board policy and except if:\n\n(a) the operator of the facility using good engineering practices and established approved calculation methodologies estimated that the facility's emissions would not require a permit pursuant to the Air Quality Control Act; and\n\n(b) upon discovery of the discrepancy between the calculated pre-construction maximum facility emissions and the calculated post-construction maximum facility emissions, the operator of the facility applies for the appropriate permit within thirty calendar days; or\n\n(5) had any permit revoked or permanently suspended for cause under the environmental laws of any state or the United States.\n\nQ. In making a finding under Subsection P of this section, the department or local agency may consider aggravating and mitigating factors.\n\nR. If an applicant or permittee whose permit is being considered for denial or revocation on any basis provided by Subsection P of this section has submitted an action plan that has been approved in writing by the secretary or director, and plan approval includes a period of operation under a conditional permit that will allow the applicant or permittee a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate its rehabilitation, the secretary or director may issue a conditional permit for a reasonable period of time.\n\nS. An applicant for a permit pursuant to the Air Quality Control Act shall file a disclosure statement with the department or local agency with the information listed in Subsection P of this section, and on a form developed by the department. An existing permit holder shall provide such disclosure upon request by the department or local agency.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 12-14-7, enacted by Laws 1972, ch. 51, § 4; 1973, ch. 322, § 4; 1979, ch. 393, § 3; 1981, ch. 373, § 5; 1983, ch. 34, § 3; 1987, ch. 293, § 2; 1992, ch. 20, § 8; 1999, ch. 139, § 1; 2001, ch. 133, § 2; 2003, ch. 8, § 1; 2021, ch. 89, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For definitions of \"department,\" \"board\" and \"federal act,\"see74-2-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the federal Clean Air Act,see42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.\n\nFor Section 502 of the federal Clean Air Act, referred to in Subparagraph B(11)(a),see42 U.S.C. § 7661a.\n\nFor Section 505 the federal Clean Air Act, referred to in Subparagraph B(11)(a),see42 U.S.C. § 7661d.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective June 18, 2021, authorized the department of environment or local agency to deny any permit application or revoke any permit issued pursuant to the Air Quality Control Act for cause, including poor compliance history, a previous felony conviction related to an environmental crime, constructing or operating an unpermitted facility, with exceptions, or based on a prior permit revocation or suspension in other states or under federal law; and added Subsections P through S.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, added \"except as provided in Subsection O of this section\" at the beginning of Subsection C and added Subsection O.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, substituted \"local agency\" for \"local board\" in Paragraph B(9); rewrote Subsections C and D; and deleted \"new\" preceding \"source will or will not\" in Subsection L.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective January 1, 2000, substituted \"determine\" for \"ensure\" in Subsection B(1); substituted \"ninety days\" for \"one hundred eighty days\" in Subsection B(2)(a); inserted \"administratively\", substituted \"subject to\" for \"affected by\" and added the language following \"significant deterioration\" in Subsections B(2)(a) and B(2)(b); substituted \"one hundred eighty days\" for \"two hundred forty days\" in Subsection B(2)(b); added Subsections B(3), B(4), B(8) and B(9), and redesignated the remaining subsections accordingly; substituted \"in this paragraph\" for \"above\" in Subsection D(2)(d); substituted \"petition\" for \"request\" in the last sentence of Subsection H; and substituted \"sixty days\" for \"ninety days\" in the first sentence of Subsection I.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective March 5, 1992, rewrote this section to the extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nIn matters that substantially affect the public interest, notice and the public's opportunity to be heard is mandatory.— In an appeal from a decision of the Albuquerque-Bernalillo county air quality control board (board), where petitioners challenged a permit issued by the city of Albuquerque environmental health department (department) allowing respondents to construct a gas station with authorization to pump up to 7,000,000 gallons of gasoline per year, claiming that the department had failed to take into account various \"quality of life\" concerns and that the department's decision to grant the permit application would cause emissions, odors, fumes, increased traffic, and other negative impacts on petitioners' property, the board's decision to grant respondent's motion for summary judgment was contrary to law, because the notice of hearing failed to inform the public that the board might resolve the appeal summarily prior to the public hearing, contrary to 74-2-7(I) NMSA 1978 which requires the board to consider the public's views or arguments when a permitting action substantially affects the public interest.Freed v. City of Albuquerque (In re Merits Regarding Air Quality Permit No. 3135), 2017-NMCA-011.\n\nApplication of reasonable probability of injury standard not required during permitting process.— Where the city of Albuquerque environmental health department (EHD) issued an authority-to-construct permit to an oil company pursuant to the New Mexico Air Quality Control Act (AQCA), 74-2-1 to 74-2-17 NMSA 1978, and where the Albuquerque-Bernalillo county air quality control board (board) upheld the EHD's issuance of the permit, and where plaintiff appealed the board's order, claiming that EHD and the board each failed to apply a \"reasonable probability of injury\" standard when evaluating the permit, the board did not err in upholding EHD's issuance of the authority-to-construct permit, because 74-2-7 NMSA 1978 directs EHD and the board to determine whether local, state, and federal air pollution standards or federal regulations have been violated, but does not impose on EHD or the board a requirement to independently apply the reasonable probability of injury standard when considering whether to grant a permit.Southwest Organizing Project v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Air Quality Control Bd., 2021-NMCA-005.\n\nRequirement to consider community testimony met during permitting process.— Where the City of Albuquerque environmental health department (EHD) issued an authority-to-construct permit to an oil company pursuant to the New Mexico Air Quality Control Act (AQCA), 74-2-1 to 74-2-17 NMSA 1978, and where the Albuquerque-Bernalillo county air quality control board (board) upheld the EHD's issuance of the permit, and where plaintiff appealed the board's order, claiming that EHD, during the application process, and the board, at the later adjudicatory hearing, were required to consider community testimony regarding the oil company's effect on local resident quality of life, the board did not err in upholding EHD's issuance of the authority-to-construct permit, because EHD, during the initial application process, met the public comment requirement by holding a public information hearing, accepting pubic testimony about concerns for quality of life, and addressing written comments submitted before and during the hearing, and the board, during the hearings following the petition of EHD's decision to grant the permit, similarly permitted public testimony. EHD and the board, however, were not required to specifically address public testimony regarding quality of life issues in resolving the permit application.Southwest Organizing Project v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Air Quality Control Bd., 2021-NMCA-005.\n\nHearing officer did not err in issuing a discovery order.— Where the city of Albuquerque environmental health department (EHD) issued an authority-to-construct permit to an oil company pursuant to the New Mexico Air Quality Control Act (AQCA), 74-2-1 to 74-2-17 NMSA 1978, and where the Albuquerque-Bernalillo county air quality control board (board) upheld the EHD's issuance of the permit, and where plaintiff appealed the board's order, claiming that the board's hearing officer acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and not in accordance with the board's regulations in issuing a discovery order, there was no error because plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the hearing officer permitted the discovery of irrelevant information or that the added burden of complying with the discovery order affected the outcome of the hearing.Southwest Organizing Project v.

The environmental improvement board or the local board may grant an individual variance from the limitations prescribed under the Air Quality Control Act, any regulation of the environmental improvement board or the local board or any permit condition imposed by the department or the local agency whenever it is found, upon presentation of adequate proof:\n\n(1) that compliance with any part of that act, any regulation of the environmental improvement board or the local board or any permit condition will:\n\n(a) result in an arbitrary and unreasonable taking of property; or\n\n(b) impose an undue economic burden upon any lawful business, occupation or activity; and\n\n(2) that the granting of the variance will not:\n\n(a) result in a condition injurious to health or safety; or\n\n(b) cause or contribute to an air contaminant level in excess of any primary national ambient air quality standards.\n\nB. No variance shall be granted pursuant to this section until the environmental improvement board or the local board has considered the relative interests of the applicant, other owners of property likely to be affected by the discharges and the general public.\n\nC. Any variance or renewal thereof shall be granted within the requirements of Subsection A of this section and for time periods and under conditions consistent with the reasons therefor and within the following limitations:\n\n(1) if the variance is granted on the ground that there are no practicable means known or available for the adequate prevention, abatement or control of the air pollution involved, it shall be only until the necessary means for prevention, abatement or control become known and available;\n\n(2) if the variance is granted on the ground that compliance with the particular requirement from which variance is sought will necessitate the taking of measures that because of their extent or cost, must be spread over a considerable period of time, it shall be for a period not to exceed such reasonable time as, in the view of the environmental improvement board or the local board, is requisite for the taking of the necessary measures. A variance granted on the ground specified in this paragraph shall contain a timetable for the taking of action in an expeditious manner and shall be conditioned on adherence to the timetable; or\n\n(3) if the variance is granted on the ground that it is justified to relieve or prevent hardship of a kind other than that provided for in Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, it shall be for not more than one year.\n\nD. Any person seeking a variance shall do so by filing a petition for variance with the secretary or the director charged with implementation of the Air Quality Control Act at the site where the variance will apply. The secretary or the director shall promptly investigate the petition and make recommendation to his respective board as to the disposition of the petition.\n\nE. Upon receiving the recommendation of the secretary or the director on the variance, the environmental improvement board or the local board shall:\n\n(1) if the secretary or the director favors a variance, hold a public hearing prior to the granting of any variance; and\n\n(2) if the secretary or the director is opposed to the granting of the variance, hold a hearing only upon the request of the petitioner.\n\nF. In the hearing, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 12-14-8, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 277, § 8; 1970, ch. 58, § 6; 1973, ch. 322, § 5; 1979, ch. 393, § 4; 1992, ch. 20, § 9.\n\nCross references.— For definitions of \"board\" and \"director\",see74-2-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective March 5, 1992, revised the internal subsection designations in Subsection A, added Subsection A(2)(b), substituted \"environmental improvement board or the local board\" for \"board\" several times throughout the section, substituted \"secretary or the director\" for \"director\" several times throughout the section, added all of the present language of the first sentence of Subsection D following \"director\", and made stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nCriterion for denial of variance.— Board may deny variance when the air pollution that would result from granting variance would with reasonable probability injure health, but board may not deny variance upon mere showing that condition tends to cause harm.Duke City Lumber Co. v.

N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 1980-NMCA-160, 95 N.M. 401, 622 P.2d 709,rev'd on other grounds, 1984-NMSC-042, 101 N.M. 291, 681 P.2d 717.\n\nOnce party makes showing, burden of going forward shifts.— Once the party who seeks a variance and thus bears the burden of proof has made a prima facie showing, the burden of going forward with the evidence shifts to the opposing party.Duke City Lumber Co. v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 1980-NMCA-160, 95 N.M. 401, 622 P.2d 709,rev'd on other grounds, 1984-NMSC-042, 101 N.M. 291, 681 P.2d 717.\n\nNotice and hearing prerequisite to granting variance.— The environmental improvement board cannot grant a variance without first having given the public reasonable notice and a hearing on the contemplated variance. Where the notice of the hearing on a proposed amendment contains no mention of a variance, the board cannot legally grant a variance after the hearing. The order granting the variance is, therefore, void. 1976 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 76-23.\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico law relating to administrative law, see 12 N.M.L.

Any person adversely affected by an administrative action taken by the environmental improvement board, the local board, the secretary or the director may appeal to the court of appeals. All appeals shall be upon the record made at the hearing and shall be taken to the court of appeals within thirty days following the date of the action.\n\nB. For appeals of regulations, the date of the action shall be the date of the filing of the regulation by the environmental improvement board or the local board pursuant to the State Rules Act [Chapter 14, Article 4 NMSA 1978].\n\nC. Upon appeal, the court of appeals shall set aside the action only if found to be:\n\n(1) arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion;\n\n(2) not supported by substantial evidence in the record; or\n\n(3) otherwise not in accordance with law.\n\nD. After a hearing and a showing of good cause by the appellant, a stay of the action being appealed may be granted:\n\n(1) by the environmental improvement board, the local board, the department or the local agency, whichever took the action being appealed; or\n\n(2) by the court of appeals if the environmental improvement board, the local board, the department or the local agency denies a stay or fails to act upon an application for a stay within sixty days after receipt of the application.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 12-14-8.1, enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 57, § 1; 1979, ch. 393, § 5; 1992, ch. 20, § 10.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective March 5, 1992, substituted the present section catchline for \"Variances; judicial review\"; in Subsection A, substituted all of the present language of the first sentence preceding \"may appeal\" for \"Any person to whom the board denies a variance, after a hearing,\" and substituted \"following the date of the action\" for \"after the board's denial\" in the second sentence; rewrote Subsection B; substituted \"action\" for \"board's denial of the variance request\" in the introductory paragraph of Subsection C; and rewrote Subsection D.\n\nRight to participate in appeal of administrative rule-making.— Persons who have participated in a legally significant manner in an administrative rule-making proceeding have the right to participate as parties to an appeal if they express such an intention.New Energy Econ., Inc. v. Vanzi, 2012-NMSC-005, 274 P.3d 53.\n\nWhere petitioners in an administrative rule-making proceeding initiated the proceeding; proposed or supported the adoption of a new rule, presented the kind of evidence that directly informed the environmental improvement board's decision on whether to adopt the new rule, submitted expert technical testimony and exhibits, and made legal and closing arguments in support of the new rule; under the statutes and rules governing the rule-making process of the EIB, petitioners were considered to be \"parties\" to the proceedings and assumed roles that imposed additional responsibilities and preparation on them that were not imposed on participants; participants in the administrative proceedings appealed the adoption of the new rule; and the court of appeals denied petitioners the right to intervene as parties in the appeal, the court of appeals did not have the discretion to deny intervention for the petitioners because the requirements imposed upon petitioners as parties in the rule-making proceeding, the contributions they made, highlighted by their technical testimony, and the possible challenge to those contributions on appeal, afforded petitioners a right to defend their positions on appeal.New Energy Econ., Inc. v. Vanzi, 2012-NMSC-005, 274 P.3d 53.\n\nDeclaratory judgment action to determine authority to enact regulations.— A plaintiff may file an action under the Declaratory Judgment Act to raise a purely legal challenge to the environmental improvement board's statutory authority to enact automobile emissions regulations under state law and may file the action independent of the administrative appeal process, with or without the environmental improvement board's consent.State ex rel. Hanosh v. State ex rel. King, 2009-NMSC-047, 147 N.M. 87, 217 P.3d 100, aff'g State ex rel. Hanosh v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 2008-NMCA-156, 145 N.M. 270, 196 P.3d 970.\n\nStandard of judicial review.— The substantial evidence rule for administrative appeals is supplemented with a \"whole record\" standard for judicial review of findings of fact made by administrative agency, so that the standard for upholding a decision by the environmental improvement board is whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence in record as a whole.Duke City Lumber Co. v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 1984-NMSC-042, 101 N.M. 291, 681 P.2d 717.\n\nEnvironmental Improvement Board did not err in granting air quality permit and general construction registrations.— Where petitioner challenged the New Mexico environmental improvement board's (board) decision to affirm the New Mexico environment department's (department) grant of an air quality permit and three general construction permit registrations for a gas plant in Eddy county, New Mexico, arguing that the plant's ozone emissions would exceed permissible levels, the board did not err in affirming the department's grant of the permits, because the use of significant impact levels, a de minimis increase of air contaminant levels that do not violate the \"cause or contribute to\" standard of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), is allowable when determining whether a facility causes or contributes to an increase of the NAAQS, substantial evidence demonstrated that the permit and the registration's emissions would not cause or contribute to an increase in the ozone NAAQS, and the general construction permit registrations were not located in a nonattainment zone, which is a designation that may only be implemented by the federal environmental protection agency.WildEarth Guardians v.
