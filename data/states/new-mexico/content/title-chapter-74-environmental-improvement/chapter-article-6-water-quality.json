Sangre de Cristo Dev. Co., 372 F. Supp. 348 (D.N.M. 1974), rev'd on other grounds, 519 F.2d 370 (10th Cir. 1975).\n\nAn implied private right of action does not existunder this section and a negligence per se claim may not be predicated on a violation of this section.Schwartzman, Inc. v. Atchison, Topeca & Santa Fe Ry., 857 F. Supp. 838 (D.N.M. 1994).\n\nProvided Indian proprietary interest and self-government unimpaired.— The application of state antipollution laws to industries located on Indian land is valid, provided that the operation of those laws neither impairs the proprietary interest of the Indian people in their lands nor limits the right of the tribe or pueblo to govern matters of tribal relations. The regulation of industrial discharges is not a matter fundamental to tribal relations, and the state supervision of environment pollution will not limit, in any meaningful manner, the right of the several Indian peoples to govern themselves. The extension of pollution controls to industries located on Indian land will not affect the ownership or control of the land. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-05.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Control of Industrial Water Pollution in New Mexico,\" see 9 Nat.

in Subsection M, after \"health or the environment\", added \"or for the use of produced water\"; and added Subsections P and Q.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2019, ch. 197, § 12 provided that the provisions of Laws 2019, ch. 197 apply to contracts entered into on and after July 1, 2019.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective June 19, 2009, added Subsection C; in Subsection E, in the third sentence, after \"Regulations\" deleted \"shall not specify the method to be used to prevent or abate water pollution, but\"; and added Subsection K.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective March 10, 2003, inserted present Subsection L and redesignated former Subsection L as Subsection M.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, in Subsection C, substituted \"based on credible scientific data and other evidence appropriate under the Water Quality Act\" for \"subject to the Water Quality Act\"; and at the end of Subsection E, inserted \"and shall maintain a repository of the scientific data required by this act\".\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, inserted \"management\" in Subsection B; in Subsection C, deleted \"as a guide to water pollution control\" following \"standards\" in the first sentence and added all of the remaining language following the first occurrence of \"standards\"; in Subsection D, rewrote the introductory paragraph, inserted \"environment\" in Paragraph (1), made minor stylistic changes in Paragraphs (2), (5), and (6), and added Paragraph (7); substituted the last sentence of Subsection E for the former last sentence which read \"The environmental improvement division of the health and environment department shall provide testing and other technical services\"; made minor stylistic changes in Subsections G, H, and J; and inserted \"or the environment\" in Subsection K.\n\nPermit conditions.— The legislature did not want regulations to specify a particular method because it understood the inflexibility in specifying a particular method in a regulation. Section 74-6-4D NMSA 1978 illustrates the legislature's intention to avoid a required approach and, instead, to grant flexibility in determining the appropriate method to use for each site. Section 74-6-4D NMSA 1978 is consistent with the idea that each site is unique, different in scale, different in impact, and different in geology and hydrology.Phelps Dodge Tyrone, Inc. v. N.M.

Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2007-NMCA-084, 142 N.M. 200, 164 P.3d 81.\n\nRelevant factors in adopting water quality standards.— The adoption of water quality standards is governed by Subsection C (now D) and the commission is not required to consider technical feasibility and economic reasonableness of the standard or to determine that there is available demonstrated control technology to abate contamination to the standard.N.M. Mining Ass'n v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2007-NMCA-010, 141 N.M. 41, 150 P.3d 991.\n\nAdoption of the Copper Rule was a permissible exercise of the water quality control commission's authority.— Where petitioners appealed the water quality control commission's (commission) decision to adopt the Copper Rule, a rule which was designed to control and contain discharges of water contaminants specific to copper mine facilities and their operations to prevent water pollution so that ground water meets state standards, claiming that the Copper Rule is inconsistent with and violates the Water Quality Act (WQA), the commission did not abuse its discretion in adopting the Copper Rule, because the adoption of the rule is a permissible exercise of the commission's statutory authority, and the Copper Rule advances the core purposes of 74-6-5(E)(3) NMSA 1978 by protecting groundwater outside the area of open pit hydrologic containment and monitoring wells.Gila Res.

Mining Assn. v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2007-NMCA-084, 142 N.M. 200, 164 P.3d 81.\n\nThe water quality control commission's decision to amend the definition of surface waters of the state to eliminate language referring to interstate commerce, which was not based on scientific evidence but on uncertainty about the scope of federal regulatory jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act, was supported by substantial evidence.N.M.

N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2004-NMCA-073, 136 N.M. 45, 94 P.3d 788.\n\nDiscretion in consideration of factors.— In adopting standards for organic compounds in groundwater, Subsection D (now E) does not require the record to contain the commission's consideration of every part within the six (now seven) factors for each organic compound. The commission possesses reasonable discretion in its consideration of the six factors and in the weight it gives to each factor.Tenneco Oil Co. v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 1987-NMCA-153, 107 N.M. 469, 760 P.2d 161, cert. denied (1988).\n\nNo requirement that commission consider complete environmental impact.— There is no specific requirement in the commission's mandate that it consider to the fullest extent possible the environmental consequences of its action. The commission could in all good faith adopt a regulation governing the effluent quality of sewage so restrictive that municipalities would turn to methods other than those currently used to dispose of it which would have adverse environmental consequences far more serious than some pollution of the waters of the state.City of Roswell v.

      "text": "A. By regulation, the commission may require persons to obtain from a constituent agency designated by the commission a permit for the discharge of any water contaminant or for the disposal or reuse of septage or sludge.\n\nB. The commission shall adopt regulations establishing procedures for certifying federal water quality permits.\n\nC. Prior to the issuance of a permit, the constituent agency may require the submission of plans, specifications and other relevant information that it deems necessary.\n\nD. The commission shall by regulation set the dates upon which applications for permits shall be filed and designate the time periods within which the constituent agency shall, after the filing of an administratively complete application for a permit, either grant the permit, grant the permit subject to conditions or deny the permit. The constituent agency has the burden of showing that each condition is reasonable and necessary to ensure compliance with the Water Quality Act and applicable regulations, considering site-specific conditions. After regulations have been adopted for a particular industry, permits for facilities in that industry shall be subject to conditions contained in the regulations. Additional conditions on a final permit may be imposed if the applicant is provided with an opportunity to review and provide comments in writing on the draft permit conditions and to receive a written explanation of the reasons for the conditions from the constituent agency.\n\nE. The constituent agency shall deny any application for a permit or deny the certification of a federal water quality permit if:\n\n(1) the effluent would not meet applicable state or federal effluent regulations, standards of performance or limitations;\n\n(2) any provision of the Water Quality Act would be violated;\n\n(3) the discharge would cause or contribute to water contaminant levels in excess of any state or federal standard. Determination of the discharge's effect on ground water shall be measured at any place of withdrawal of water for present or reasonably foreseeable future use. Determination of the discharge's effect on surface waters shall be measured at the point of discharge; or\n\n(4) the applicant has, within the ten years immediately preceding the date of submission of the permit application:\n\n(a) knowingly misrepresented a material fact in an application for a permit;\n\n(b) refused or failed to disclose any information required under the Water Quality Act;\n\n(c) been convicted of a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude;\n\n(d) been convicted of a felony in any court for any crime defined by state or federal law as being a restraint of trade, price-fixing, bribery or fraud;\n\n(e) exhibited a history of willful disregard for environmental laws of any state or the United States; or\n\n(f) had an environmental permit revoked or permanently suspended for cause under any environmental laws of any state or the United States.\n\nF. The commission shall by regulation develop procedures that ensure that the public, affected governmental agencies and any other state whose water may be affected shall receive notice of each application for issuance, renewal or modification of a permit. Public notice shall include:\n\n(1) for issuance or modification of a permit:\n\n(a) notice by mail to adjacent and nearby landowners; local, state and federal governments; land grant organizations; ditch associations; and Indian nations, tribes or pueblos;\n\n(b) posting at a place conspicuous to the public and near the discharge or proposed discharge site; and\n\n(c) a display advertisement in English and Spanish in a newspaper of general circulation in the location of the discharge or proposed discharge; provided, however, that the advertisement shall not be displayed in the classified or legal advertisement sections; and\n\n(2) for issuance of renewals of permits:\n\n(a) notice by mail to the interested public, municipalities, counties, land grant organizations, ditch associations and Indian nations, tribes or pueblos; and\n\n(b) a display advertisement in English and Spanish in a newspaper of general circulation in the location of the discharge; provided, however, that the advertisement shall not be displayed in the classified or legal advertisement sections.\n\nG. No ruling shall be made on any application for a permit without opportunity for a public hearing at which all interested persons shall be given a reasonable chance to submit evidence, data, views or arguments orally or in writing and to examine witnesses testifying at the hearing. The hearing shall be recorded. Any person submitting evidence, data, views or arguments shall be subject to examination at the hearing.\n\nH. The commission may adopt regulations for the operation and maintenance of the permitted facility, including requirements, as may be necessary or desirable, that relate to continuity of operation, personnel training and financial responsibility, including financial responsibility for corrective action.\n\nI. Permits shall be issued for fixed terms not to exceed five years, except that for new discharges, the term of the permit shall commence on the date the discharge begins, but in no event shall the term of the permit exceed seven years from the date the permit was issued.\n\nJ. By regulation, the commission may impose reasonable conditions upon permits requiring permittees to:\n\n(1) install, use and maintain effluent monitoring devices;\n\n(2) sample effluents and receiving waters for any known or suspected water contaminants in accordance with methods and at locations and intervals as may be prescribed by the commission;\n\n(3) establish and maintain records of the nature and amounts of effluents and the performance of effluent control devices;\n\n(4) provide any other information relating to the discharge or direct or indirect release of water contaminants; and\n\n(5) notify a constituent agency of the introduction of new water contaminants from a new source and of a substantial change in volume or character of water contaminants being introduced from sources in existence at the time of the issuance of the permit.\n\nK. The commission shall provide by regulation a schedule of fees for permits, not exceeding the estimated cost of investigation and issuance, modification and renewal of permits. Fees collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the water quality management fund.\n\nL. The issuance of a permit does not relieve any person from the responsibility of complying with the provisions of the Water Quality Act, any applicable regulations or water quality standards of the commission or any applicable federal laws, regulations or standards.\n\nM. A permit may be terminated or modified by the constituent agency that issued the permit prior to its date of expiration for any of the following causes:\n\n(1) violation of any condition of the permit;\n\n(2) obtaining the permit by misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts;\n\n(3) violation of any provisions of the Water Quality Act or any applicable regulations, standard of performance or water quality standards;\n\n(4) violation of any applicable state or federal effluent regulations or limitations; or\n\n(5) change in any condition that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the permitted discharge.\n\nN. If the constituent agency denies, terminates or modifies a permit or grants a permit subject to condition, the constituent agency shall notify the applicant or permittee by certified mail of the action taken and the reasons. Notice shall also be given by mail to persons who participated in the permitting action.\n\nO. A person who participated in a permitting action before a constituent agency or a person affected by a certification of a federal permit and who is adversely affected by such permitting action or certification may file a petition for review before the commission. Unless a timely petition for review is made, the decision of the constituent agency shall be final and not subject to judicial review. The petition shall:\n\n(1) be made in writing to the commission within thirty days from the date notice is given of the constituent agency's action;\n\n(2) include a statement of the issues to be raised and the relief sought; and\n\n(3) be provided to all other persons submitting evidence, data, views or arguments in the proceeding before the constituent agency.\n\nP. If a timely petition for review is made, the commission shall consider the petition within ninety days after receipt of the petition. The commission shall notify the petitioner and the applicant or permittee, if other than the petitioner, by certified mail of the date, time and place of the review. If the petitioner is not the applicant or permittee, the applicant or permittee shall be a party to the proceeding. The commission shall ensure that the public receives notice of the date, time and place of the review.\n\nQ. The commission shall review the record compiled before the constituent agency, including the transcript of any public hearing held on the application or draft permit, and shall allow any party to submit arguments. The commission may designate a hearing officer to review the record and the arguments of the parties and recommend a decision to the commission. The commission shall consider and weigh only the evidence contained in the record before the constituent agency and the recommended decision of the hearing officer, if any, and shall not be bound by the factual findings or legal conclusions of the constituent agency. Based on the review of the evidence, the arguments of the parties and recommendations of the hearing officer, the commission shall sustain, modify or reverse the action of the constituent agency. The commission shall enter ultimate findings of fact and conclusions of law and keep a record of the review.\n\nR. Prior to the date set for review, if a party shows to the satisfaction of the commission that there was no reasonable opportunity to submit comment or evidence on an issue being challenged, the commission shall order that additional comment or evidence be taken by the constituent agency. Based on the additional evidence, the constituent agency may revise the decision and shall promptly file with the commission the additional evidence received and action taken. The commission shall consider the additional evidence within ninety days after receipt of the additional evidence and shall notify the petitioner and the applicant or permittee, if other than the petitioner, of the date, time and place of the review.\n\nS. The commission shall notify the petitioner and all other participants in the review proceeding of the action taken by the commission and the reasons for that action.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 75-39-4.1, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 326, § 4; 1985, ch. 157, § 1; 1989, ch. 248, § 1; 1993, ch. 100, § 3; 1993, ch. 291, § 5; 1999, ch. 21, § 1; 2005, ch. 195, § 1; 2009, ch. 194, § 2.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective June 19, 2009, in Subsection D, added the second, third and fourth sentences.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added Subsection F(1) through (2) the public notice required for issuance or modification of a permit and for issuance of renewals of permits; provided in Subsection G that the hearing shall be recorded and that any person who submits evidence, data, views or arguments shall be subject to examination at the hearing; provided in Subsection N that notice shall also be given by mail to persons who participated in the permitting action; deletes the former provision to Subsection O that the petition shall be made in writing to the commission within thirty days from the date notice is given to the agency's action, provides that if a petition for review is not timely, the decision of the agency is not subject to judicial review; added Subsection O(1) through (3) to provide requirement relating to the petition; deleted provisions in former Subsection O, which required the commission to hold a hearing and which related to the conduct of the hearing; deleted former Subsection P, which related to the recording of the hearing before the commission; provided in Subsection P that the commission shall consider the petition and that if the petitioner is not a the applicant or permittee, the applicant or permittee shall be a party to the action; added Subsection Q, which provides for a record review by the commission or a hearing officer; added Subsection R which provides the commission may order that the agency take additional comment or evidence for review by the commission; and, added Subsection S to require the commission to give notice of the action taken by the commission and the reasons for that action.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, in Subsection N substituted \"review\" for \"hearing\" in two places and substituted \"petition\" for \"request\" in the last sentence, substituted \"review\" for \"hearing\" in the first sentence of Subsection O, and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective March 31, 1993, in Subsection H, deleted the last sentence which read \"Effective July 1, 1992, all fees collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the general fund\".\n\nPermit conditions.— The failure to express a limitation on the conditions which may be imposed indicates the legislature's intent that NMED should retain sufficient discretion to carry out its mission and is not limited by the conditions listed in Section 74-6-5J NMSA 1978. In adopting Section 74-6-5J the legislature wanted to emphasize the importance of monitoring, sampling, and reporting by allowing the commission to impose these conditions through regulation. When interpreted in harmony with Sections 74-6-4D and 74-6-5D NMSA 1978, Section 74-6-5J NMSA 1978 is a grant of authority, not a limitation.Phelps Dodge Tyrone, Inc. v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2006-NMCA-115, 140 N.M. 464, 143 P.3d 502, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-009, 140 N.M. 542, 144 P.3d 101.\n\nDate of submission.— The date of submission of an application for a discharge permit and discharge plan to the environment department occurs when the constituent agency has received all of the information that it needs to consider the application, including all information that an applicant must include in the discharge plan. The date of submission of an application may be the date that an applicant initially files an application and discharge plan with the environment department or a later date when the applicant files supplemental information that the applicant failed to provide in the initial filing and that the constituent agency determines is necessary to consider the application.Summers v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2011-NMCA-097, 150 N.M. 694, 265 P.3d 745.\n\nMandatory denial of a discharge permit is required if an application for a permit contains a material misrepresentation of fact when the application is submitted. A discharge permit must be denied in cases where a misrepresentation is made in an initial application and no further information is required by the constituent agency and in cases in which the initial application does not contain any misrepresentation, but supplemental information requested by the constituent agency contains a misrepresentation.Summers v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2011-NMCA-097, 150 N.M. 694, 265 P.3d 745.\n\nDenial of discharge permits for misrepresentations applies to current and prior applications for permits.— The requirement that the constituent agency deny a discharge permit if the applicant has, within the ten years immediately preceding the date of submission of the permit application, knowingly misrepresented a material fact in the application applies to both current and prior applications for discharge permits.Summers v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2011-NMCA-097, 150 N.M. 694, 265 P.3d 745.\n\nApplicant knowingly misrepresented a material fact.— Where the applicant for a septic waste discharge permit initially provided geological information in the application about a well that was 1,100 feet from the discharge site; environment department regulations required applicants to provide geological information about the proposed discharge site if available; the applicant failed to provide in the application geological information about a well that the applicant had drilled that was 100 feet from the discharge site, concealed facts about the date and circumstances surrounding how the applicant had drilled the well; and submitted a fabricated well log for the applicant's well, the applicant knowingly made misrepresentations of material facts.Summers v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2011-NMCA-097, 150 N.M. 694, 265 P.3d 745.\n\nMisrepresentation occurred within the ten years preceding submission of permit application.— Where the applicant for a septic waste discharge permit filed an application on August 19, 2004; the application contained geological information about a well that was 1,100 feet from the discharge site; environment department regulations required applicants of provide geological information about the proposed discharge site if available; the applicant made a misrepresentation of material fact on August 19, 2004 when the applicant failed to include in the application geological information about a well that the applicant had drilled that was 100 feet from the discharge site and impliedly represented that information about the more distant well was the only relevant information available; and the application for the discharge permit was submitted on July 28, 2006 when the applicant provided additional geological information that the ground water bureau had requested to fully evaluate the application, the misrepresentation was made within ten years immediately preceding the date of submission of the permit application and required denial of the discharge permit.Summers v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2011-NMCA-097, 150 N.M. 694, 265 P.3d 745.\n\nRegulations distinguished.— There is no reason to disassociate the commission's general regulations relating to motions from those relating to formal and informal appeal petitions and appeal hearing proceedings.Gila Res. Info. Project v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2005-NMCA-139, 138 N.M. 625, 124 P.3d 1164, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-009, 138 N.M. 439, 120 P.3d 1182.\n\nRegulation requirements for a public hearing.— The regulation promulgated to effectuate 74-6-5(G) NMSA 1978, providing for the opportunity for a public hearing, requires that a party first submit a request in writing, setting forth the reasons a hearing should be held, and a determination by the secretary of the New Mexico environment department that there is a substantial public interest in the matters that are the subject of the permit application.Communities for Clean Water v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2018-NMCA-024.\n\nWhere appellant, an organization whose mission is to ensure that community waters which receive adverse impacts from Los Alamos national labs are kept safe for drinking and other uses, appealed the water quality control commission's (WQCC) final order sustaining the decision of the New Mexico environment department (NMED) to deny appellant's request for a public hearing on a water discharge permit application, the WQCC's decision sustaining NMED's denial of appellant's request for public hearing was arbitrary, capricious and not supported by substantial evidence, because although the plain language of 74-6-5(G) NMSA 1978 indicates that the legislature intended to confer limited discretion on the secretary of NMED to determine whether a public hearing should be held on a permit application under the Water Quality Act, in this case the WQCC lacked substantial evidence to support its decision to sustain NMED's denial of appellant's request for a public hearing when the WQCC failed to include an evaluation of factors relevant to a substantial public interest.Communities for Clean Water v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2018-NMCA-024.\n\nCommission's requirement of information to prevent water pollution within statutory mandate.— Where the objective of this article is to abate and prevent water pollution, it is not \"clearly incorrect\" for the commission to require a discharger of toxic pollutants to provide a site and method for flow measurement and to provide any pertinent information relating to the discharge of water contaminants in order to demonstrate to the commission that the plans of the discharger will not result in a violation of the standards and regulations; these requirements are well within the statutory mandate.Bokum Res. Corp. v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-090, 93 N.M. 546, 603 P.2d 285.\n\nAdoption of the Copper Rule was a permissible exercise of the water quality control commission's authority.— Where petitioners appealed the water quality control commission's (commission) decision to adopt the Copper Rule, a rule which was designed to control and contain discharges of water contaminants specific to copper mine facilities and their operations to prevent water pollution so that ground water meets state standards, claiming that the Copper Rule is inconsistent with and violates the Water Quality Act (WQA), the commission did not abuse its discretion in adopting the Copper Rule, because the adoption of the rule is a permissible exercise of the commission's statutory authority, and the Copper Rule advances the core purposes of 74-6-5(E)(3) NMSA 1978 by protecting groundwater outside the area of open pit hydrologic containment and monitoring wells.Gila Res. Info. Project v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2018-NMSC-025,aff'g2015-NMCA-076, 355 P.3d 36.\n\nDetermining locations of places of withdrawal left to the discretion of the water quality control commission.— Determining the locations of places of withdrawal under Subsection E(3) of this section is left to the discretion of the water quality control commission (commission), and where the commission created a set of concrete regulations via the rule-making process that specifically protect ground water underlying mine facilities so that areas within a mine facility may become places of withdrawal, the commission is in compliance with the Water Quality Act, and the commission's decision not to include, in the regulations, factors or policies to be used for determining places of withdrawal did not violate the Water Quality Act.Gila Res. Info. Project v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2015-NMCA-076, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-007, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-007, and cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-007.\n\nIn determining whether administrative interpretation is \"clearly incorrect,\"the authority granted to an administrative agency should be construed so as to permit the fullest accomplishment of the legislative intent or policy.Bokum Res.

Water Quality Control Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-090, 93 N.M. 546, 603 P.2d 285.\n\nCommission may delegate authority to administer regulations.— Where the commission gave the environmental improvement division [now department of environment] the authority to administer certain regulations, there was no unlawful delegation of authority.Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corp. v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 1982-NMCA-015, 98 N.M. 240, 647 P.2d 873.\n\nDischarge of a toxic pollutant in violation of a discharge planis a criminal act.Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corp. v. N.M.

      "text": "A. The commission by regulation may require every applicant for a permit to dispose or use septage or sludge, or within a source category designated by the commission, to file with the appropriate constituent agency a disclosure statement. The disclosure statement shall be submitted on a form developed by the commission and the department of public safety. The commission in cooperation with the department of public safety shall determine the information to be contained in the disclosure statement. The disclosure statement shall be submitted to the constituent agency at the same time that the applicant files an application for a permit pursuant to Section 74-6-5 NMSA 1978. The commission shall adopt regulations designating additional categories of sources subject to the disclosure requirements of this section as it deems appropriate and necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.\n\nB. Upon a request by the constituent agency, the department of public safety shall prepare and transmit to the constituent agency an investigative report on the applicant within ninety days after the department of public safety receives an administratively complete disclosure statement prepared by the applicant for a permit. The investigative report shall be based in part upon the disclosure statement. The ninety-day deadline for preparing the investigative report may be extended by the constituent agency for a reasonable period of time for good cause. The department of public safety in preparing the investigative report may request and receive criminal history information from any other law enforcement agency or organization. The constituent agency may also request information regarding a person who will be or could reasonably be expected to be involved in management activities of the permitted facility or a person who has a controlling interest in a permitted facility. The information received from a law enforcement agency shall be kept confidential by the department of public safety to the extent that confidentiality is imposed by the law enforcement agency as a condition for providing the information to the constituent agency or the commission.\n\nC. All persons required to file a disclosure statement shall provide any assistance or information requested by the constituent agency or the department of public safety and shall cooperate in any inquiry or investigation conducted by the department of public safety. If a person required to file a disclosure statement refuses to comply with a formal request to answer an inquiry or produce information, evidence or testimony, the application of the applicant or the permit of the permittee shall be denied or terminated by the constituent agency.\n\nD. If the information required to be included in the disclosure statement changes or if additional information should be added after the filing of the disclosure statement, the person required to file the disclosure statement shall provide the information to the constituent agency in writing within thirty days after the change or addition. Failure to provide the information within thirty days shall constitute the basis for the termination of a permit or denial of an application for a permit. Prior to terminating a permit or denying an application for a permit, the constituent agency shall notify the permittee or applicant of the constituent agency's intent to terminate a permit or deny an application and the constituent agency shall give the permittee or applicant fourteen days from the date of notice to satisfactorily explain why the information was not provided within the thirty-day period. The constituent agency shall consider the explanation of the permittee or applicant when determining whether to terminate the permit or deny the application for a permit.\n\nE. No person shall be required to submit the disclosure statement required by this section if:\n\n(1) the application is for a facility owned and operated by the state, a political subdivision of the state or an agency of the federal government or for the permitted disposal or use of septage or sludge on the premises where the sludge or septage is generated;\n\n(2) the person has submitted a disclosure statement pursuant to this section within the previous year and no changes have occurred that would require disclosure under Subsection D of this section; or\n\n(3) the person is a corporation or an officer, director or shareholder of that corporation and that corporation:\n\n(a) has on file and in effect with the federal securities and exchange commission a registration statement required by Section 5, Chapter 38, Title 1 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended;\n\n(b) submits to the constituent agency with the application for a permit evidence of the registration described in Subparagraph (a) of this subsection and a copy of the corporation's most recent annual form 10-K or an equivalent report; and\n\n(c) submits to the constituent agency on the anniversary date of the issuance of the permit evidence of registration described in Subparagraph (a) of this subsection and a copy of the corporation's most recent annual form 10-K or an equivalent report.\n\nF. Permit decisions made pursuant to this section shall be subject to the procedures established in Section 74-6-5 NMSA 1978, including notice and appeals.\n\nHistory:Laws 1993, ch. 291, § 12.\n\nCross references.— For Section 5, Chapter 38, Title 1 of the Securities Act of 1933,see15 U.S.C. § 77e.",

N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 2022-NMCA-045, cert. denied.\n\nRight to participate in appeal of administrative rule-making.— Persons who have participated in a legally significant manner in an administrative rule-making proceeding have the right to participate as parties to an appeal if they express such an intention.New Energy Econ., Inc. v. Vanzi, 2012-NMSC-005, 274 P.3d 53.\n\nWhere petitioners in an administrative rule-making proceeding supported the adoption of new rules, presented the kind of evidence that directly informed the water quality control commission's decision on whether to adopt the new rules, submitted expert technical testimony and exhibits, and made legal and closing arguments in support of the new rules; under the statutes and rules governing the rule-making process of the WQCC, petitioners were considered to be \"parties\" to the proceedings and assumed roles that imposed additional responsibilities and preparation on them that were not imposed on participants; participants in the administrative proceedings appealed the adoption of the new rules; and the court of appeals denied petitioners the right to intervene as parties in the appeal, the court of appeals did not have the discretion to deny intervention for petitioners because the requirements imposed upon the petitioners as parties in the rule-making proceeding, the contributions they made, highlighted by their technical testimony, and the possible challenge to those contributions on appeal, afforded petitioners a right to defend their positions on appeal.New Energy Econ., Inc. v. Vanzi, 2012-NMSC-005, 274 P.3d 53.\n\nWritten basis for decision not required.— Even though statute does not explicitly state that the commission must provide a written factual and legal basis for its decision, administrative agencies must provide written factual and legal basis for their decisions in order to permit an effectual and meaningful review.Gila Res.

Water Quality Control Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-090, 93 N.M. 546, 603 P.2d 285.\n\nStandards adopted as rules are appealable.— Since the standards for the evaluation of waste water to determine whether it is contaminated were adopted as rules, they are appealable to the court of appeals.Bokum Res. Corp. v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-090, 93 N.M. 546, 603 P.2d 285.\n\nLack of numerical standards not basis for invalidating regulation.— Although there are no numerical standards in a regulation for what concentration of compounds triggers the label \"toxic pollutant,\" this is not detrimental to a discharger where the director of the environmental improvement division will make that determination before a discharge plan is approved or disapproved, and the discharger will be notified. The lack of numerical standards is, therefore, not a basis for finding the regulation unconstitutional.Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corp. v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 1982-NMCA-015, 98 N.M. 240, 647 P.2d 873.\n\nStay from operation of order or regulation.— Implicit in this section is the power to grant a stay from the operation of an administrative order or regulation, after due notice and opportunity for hearing.Tenneco Oil Co. v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 1986-NMCA-033, 105 N.M. 708, 736 P.2d 986 (decided under prior law).\n\nEvidence upon review.— The \"whole record\" standard of judicial review to findings of fact made by administrative agencies controls where the commission acts in its rule-making capacity. Therefor, such a review must include the record of all public meetings and public hearings.Tenneco Oil Co. v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 1987-NMCA-153, 107 N.M. 469, 760 P.2d 161.\n\nThe legal residuum rule, which requires support by some evidence that would be admissible in a jury trial, is not applicable in a judicial review of a rule-making proceeding.Tenneco Oil Co. v.

Whenever, on the basis of any information, a constituent agency determines that a person violated or is violating a requirement, regulation or water quality standard adopted pursuant to the Water Quality Act or a condition of a permit issued pursuant to that act, the constituent agency may:\n\n(1) issue a compliance order requiring compliance immediately or within a specified time period or issue a compliance order assessing a civil penalty, or both; or\n\n(2) commence a civil action in district court for appropriate relief, including injunctive relief.\n\nB. A compliance order issued pursuant to Paragraph (1) of Subsection A of this section may include a suspension or termination of the permit allegedly violated.\n\nC. A compliance order shall state with reasonable specificity the nature of the violation. Any penalty assessed in the compliance order shall not exceed:\n\n(1) fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) per day of noncompliance with the provisions in Section 74-6-5 NMSA 1978, including a regulation adopted or a permit issued pursuant to that section; or\n\n(2) ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per day for each violation of a provision of the Water Quality Act other than the provisions in Section 74-6-5 NMSA 1978 or of a regulation or water quality standard adopted pursuant to the Water Quality Act.\n\nD. In assessing a penalty authorized by this section, the constituent agency shall take into account the seriousness of the violation, any good faith efforts to comply with the applicable requirements and other relevant factors.\n\nE. For purposes of this section, a single operational event that leads to simultaneous violations of more than one standard shall be treated as a single violation.\n\nF. If a person fails to take corrective actions within the time specified in a compliance order, the constituent agency may:\n\n(1) assess a civil penalty of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) for each day of continued noncompliance with the compliance order; and\n\n(2) suspend or terminate the permit violated by the person.\n\nG. Any compliance order issued by a constituent agency pursuant to this section shall become final unless, no later than thirty days after the compliance order is served, any person named in the compliance order submits a written request to the commission for a public hearing. The commission shall conduct a public hearing within ninety days after receipt of a request.\n\nH. The commission may appoint an independent hearing officer to preside over any public hearing held pursuant to Subsection F of this section. The hearing officer shall:\n\n(1) make and preserve a complete record of the proceedings; and\n\n(2) forward to the commission a report that includes recommendations, if recommendations are requested by the commission.\n\nI. The commission shall consider the findings of the independent hearing officer and, based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the commission shall make a final decision regarding the compliance order.\n\nJ. In connection with any proceeding under this section, the commission may:\n\n(1) adopt rules for discovery procedures; and\n\n(2) issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and for relevant papers, books and documents.\n\nK. Penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the general fund.\n\nL. As an additional means of enforcing the Water Quality Act or any regulation or standard of the commission, the commission may accept an assurance of discontinuance of any act or practice deemed in violation of the Water Quality Act or any regulation or standard adopted pursuant to that act, from any person engaging in, or who has engaged in, such act or practice, signed and acknowledged by the chairman of the commission and the party affected.

Villa, 2003-NMCA-142, 134 N.M. 679, 82 P.3d 46,aff'd, 2004-NMSC-031, 136 N.M. 367, 98 P.3d 1017.\n\nConstitutionality.— Provision in Section 74-6-10.2B NMSA 1978 which prohibits a person from knowingly allowing another person to violate this section was not unconstitutionally vague as applied where the defendant, who was hired as an environmental expert, knew the conditions of the disposal permit, and knew that waste dumped at the permitted site was not included in the permit, did not take any action to comply with the permit or to remedy the violations of which he had knowledge.State v. Villa, 2003-NMCA-142, 134 N.M. 679, 82 P.3d 46,rev'd on other grounds, 2004-NMSC-031, 2004-NMSC-031, 136 N.M. 367, 98 P.3d 1017.\n\nResentencing on attempt countsafter convictions for violations of statute were overturned for insufficient evidence deprived defendant of notice and opportunity to defend, was inconsistent with New Mexico law regarding jury instructions and preservation of error, because attempt offenses were not charged and jury was not instructed on them.State v.
