      "text": "A. The legislature finds that many persons have acquired wood burning stoves to heat their homes. The legislature further finds that wood burning stoves have been encouraged as a means of reducing our country's dependence on foreign oil and are therefore in the public interest. The legislature further finds that many of the poorer citizens of our state have acquired wood burning stoves or residences with fireplaces as a means of providing cost efficient heating for their families.\n\nB. The legislature further finds that counties and municipalities have adopted and may continue to adopt wood burning laws to prevent or reduce serious pollution problems associated with wood burning. The legislature further finds that while these laws are in the public interest, it is also in the public interest to protect the poor in our society who have wood burning stoves or fireplaces to provide cost efficient heating for their families.\n\nC. Any county or municipality which adopts a wood burning law to prohibit burning from occurring at certain times or in certain locations shall provide an exemption procedure for indigent families who need wood burning as an essential form of cost-efficient heating for their families. The exemption procedure shall include a standard for determining when a family is considered indigent for purposes of the exemption.\n\nHistory:Laws 1989, ch. 150, § 1.",
