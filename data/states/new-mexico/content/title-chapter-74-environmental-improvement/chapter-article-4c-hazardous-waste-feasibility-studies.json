      "text": "A. The legislature recognizes that there is a growing need to identify the magnitude of hazardous waste generation in New Mexico and sites at which materials classified as hazardous wastes can be treated or disposed of. The selection of sites for such hazardous waste activities is a complex technical, environmental, logistical, legal and institutional problem because of the many interdependent factors that must be considered.\n\nB. The legislature further finds that public understanding of the importance of safe treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes is critical in addressing New Mexico's hazardous waste problem.\n\nC. The legislature further finds that, because of the 1984 reauthorization and amendments to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, an increased number of hazardous waste generators throughout the state will be regulated and therefore a greater economic burden will fall upon these entities.\n\nHistory:Laws 1985 (1st S.S.), ch. 4, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,see42 U.S.C. § 6901 et seq.",

The term hazardous waste does not include solid or dissolved material in domestic sewage, or animal excrement in connection with farm, ranch or feedlot operations, or solid or dissolved materials in irrigation return flows or industrial discharges which are point sources subject to permits under Section 402 of the Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, as the provisions exist on January 1, 1981; or source, special or byproduct material as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, as these definitions exist on January 1, 1981; or any of the following, until the environmental improvement board determines that they are subject to Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq.): drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil or natural gas or geothermal energy; any fly ash waste, bottom ash waste, slag waste or flue gas emission control waste generated primarily from the combustion of coal or other fossil fuels; solid waste from the extraction, beneficiation or processing of ores and minerals, including phosphate rock and overburden from the mining of uranium ore; cement kiln dust waste; or pesticide waste disposed of by any farmer from his own use, provided that he triple rinses each emptied pesticide container and disposes of the pesticide residues on his own farm in a manner consistent with the disposal instructions on the pesticide label; and\n\nD. \"hazardous waste activity\" means the generation, treatment, storage, transportation or disposal of hazardous waste.\n\nHistory:Laws 1985 (1st S.S.), ch. 4, § 3.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law. The radioactive materials committee is now the radioactive and hazardous materials committee.See74-4A-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nLaws 1991, ch. 25, § 4 established the department of environment and provided that all references to the environmental improvement division of the health and environment department shall be construed to mean the department of environment.\n\nCross references.— For the environmental improvement board,see74-1-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor Section 402 of the federal Water Pollution Control Act,see33 U.S.C. § 1342.\n\nFor the federal Atomic Energy Act of 1954,see42 U.S.C. § 2011 et seq.\n\nAm.

The committee, after consultation with the division as to the scope of the study, shall contract with public or private entities to study the magnitude of the problem of hazardous waste generation and disposal in New Mexico, including current and projected hazardous waste generation rates. If the committee determines that generation rates and transportation costs for out-of-state disposal are significant, the study shall address the need, location, conceptual design, ownership and estimated cost of a hazardous waste transfer facility to be located within the state. The facility should be capable of handling both small and large quantities of hazardous wastes. The committee shall provide for public hearing and input during the conduct of the study.\n\nB. If the committee determines that there is a need for one or more hazardous waste transfer and waste exchange facilities, it shall make appropriate recommendations to the legislature.\n\nHistory:Laws 1985 (1st S.S.), ch. 4, § 4.",
