      "text": "A. Findings. Hearings conducted by the McClellan committee of the United States senate, without reflecting upon the aims or integrity of the vast majority of employers and labor unions have disclosed collusive, coercive and corrupt practices indulged in by a small minority of irresponsible employers and leaders of labor unions.\n\nThese practices, which shock the conscience of our citizens and are deplored by all right thinking people, have been tolerated and encouraged by the absence of appropriate statutory prohibitions and declared governmental policy.\n\nNew Mexico, on the threshold of its greatest era of economic development, for the welfare and protection of its citizens, should by statute eliminate those practices which are so destructive to good employee-employer relationships, and which in many cases have been shown to have resulted in a denial of the civil liberties of many persons.\n\nThe legislature finds that the coercive and collusive practices prohibited herein represent a serious menace to the peace, safety, morals and welfare of the people of this state. The elimination of such practices by affording effective relief therefrom is a necessary condition to the realization of personal freedom for the employee, the encouragement of employee representation according to the free will of the employees and for their greater welfare, and the protection of the public interest generally.\n\nB. Public Policy. An [In] interpretation and the application of this act [50-2-1 to 50-2-3 NMSA 1978], it is hereby declared to be the public policy of this state to mitigate and eliminate certain coercive and collusive practices of labor organizations and employers with the view of promoting and protecting the exercise by employees of the fullest possible freedom with respect to self-organization, choice of bargaining representative, collective bargaining and all other legitimate concerted activities, it being fully recognized by the legislature that employees should have an equal freedom to refrain from any such activity or activities except to the extent that such freedom may be limited by a valid agreement in writing requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 59-13-1, enacted by Laws 1959, ch. 26, § 1.\n\nProtection of right.— A mandamus proceeding against the governor to recognize a statutory or constitutional right of petitioners to organize and collectively bargain under this section or N.M. Const., art. II, §§ 4 and 18, does not meet the criteria for an exercise of original jurisdiction in mandamus by the supreme court.State ex rel. AFSCME v. Johnson, 1999-NMSC-031, 128 N.M. 481, 994 P.2d 727.\n\nInapplicable to public employer-employee relations.— State statutes regulating labor relations in private industry, such as this section, are not applicable to public employer-employee relations. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-52.\n\nAcceptable collective bargaining agreement provisions.— Institutions of higher learning may enter into collective bargaining agreements which contain provisions for settlements of disputes by way of compulsory arbitration. 1974 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 74-03.\n\nInstitutions of higher learning may legally enter into collective bargaining agreements which provide for modified agency shop and dues check-off system. 1974 Op. Att'y Gen.

      "text": "A. It shall be unlawful for a labor organization or its representatives to engage in picketing or to induce others to engage in picketing where an object thereof is:\n\n(1) coercing or inducing an employer or self-employed person to join or contribute to a labor organization; or\n\n(2) coercing or inducing an employer to recognize or bargain with a labor organization as the representative of his employees unless a majority of said employees favor such representation, provided, that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply when a majority of employees favored such representation at the commencement of such picketing, and the employer has eliminated such majority by the discharge of any employee favoring such representation, or the hiring of any additional employees opposed to such representation for the purpose of availing himself of the remedies provided in this section.\n\nB. It shall be unlawful in connection with any labor dispute for any person individually or in concert with others to hinder or prevent by mass picketing, violence or threats of violence, force, coercion or intimidation of any kind, the pursuit of any lawful work or employment, or to obstruct or interfere with entrance to or egress from any place of employment, or to obstruct or interfere with free or uninterrupted use of any public roads, streets, highways, railways, airports or other ways of travel or conveyance.\n\nC. Whoever shall be injured in his employment, business or property by reason of any violation of this section shall recover the actual damages by him sustained as a result of said violation and such punitive or exemplary damages as the court or jury may allow.\n\nD. Any person or persons may be restrained by injunction from doing any of the acts prohibited by this section without regard to the conditions and restrictions set forth in Sections 50-3-1 and 50-3-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 59-13-2, enacted by Laws 1959, ch. 26, § 2.\n\n\"Person\" to include labor organizations.— \"Person\" being inclusive, rather than exclusive, and its meaning including bodies of persons as well as individuals, union defendants are subject to this section as a labor organization is included within the word \"person.\"Gonzales v. Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int'l Union, 1966-NMSC-211, 77 N.M. 61, 419 P.2d 257.\n\nJurisdiction over claim of violence.— Claim of statutory violation based on violence or threats of violence is a claim over which the trial court has jurisdiction.Gonzales v. Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int'l Union, 1966-NMSC-211, 77 N.M. 61, 419 P.2d 257.\n\nJurisdiction based on involved conduct.— The proposed distinction between a common law tort and a statutory violation is without merit. The conduct involved is the basis for jurisdiction.Gonzales v. Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int'l Union, 1966-NMSC-211, 77 N.M. 61, 419 P.2d 257.\n\nState jurisdiction generally.— Contention that the portion of this section relating to violence or threats of violence cannot be given effect by New Mexico courts because that portion is \"arguably subject\" to 29 U.S.C. §§ 157, 158, and therefore that the New Mexico courts have no jurisdiction because the section poses a potential conflict with federal statutes, is incorrect as state jurisdiction in these situations is not overridden in the absence of clearly expressed congressional direction.Gonzales v. Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int'l Union, 1966-NMSC-211, 77 N.M. 61, 419 P.2d 257.\n\nFederal labor law preemptive.— New Mexico courts cannot give effect to those portions of this section authorizing damages for peaceful activities in connection with a labor dispute where federal labor law is applicable as its jurisdiction over such activities is preempted by federal labor law.Gonzales v. Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int'l Union, 1966-NMSC-211, 77 N.M. 61, 419 P.2d 257.\n\nAccess of customers may not be obstructed.— The provisions of Subsection B which prohibit the obstruction of the access of other employees to a place of employment also apply to the access of customers.PTA Sales, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Local 462, 1981-NMSC-089, 96 N.M. 581, 633 P.2d 689.\n\nInjunction limiting area picketed and number of pickets authorized.— An injunction which limits the number of pickets allowed, confines the area in which they may present themselves, and keeps them out of any place in which they would impede, albeit peacefully, foot traffic and access to a place of business is within the subject matter jurisdiction of a court under Subsection D.PTA Sales, Inc. v.
