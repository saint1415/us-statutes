In the hearing, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner.\n\nE. Any employer may apply to the department for a temporary order granting a variance from a regulation promulgated under the Occupational Health and Safety Act by submitting a petition to the department in the manner prescribed by regulation. A temporary variance may be granted only if the employer establishes:\n\n(1) that he is unable to comply with a regulation by its effective date because of unavailability of professional or technical personnel or of materials and equipment needed to come into compliance with the regulation or because necessary construction or alteration of facilities cannot be completed by the effective date;\n\n(2) that he is taking all available steps to safeguard his employees against the hazards covered by the regulation; and\n\n(3) that he has an effective program for coming into compliance with the regulation as quickly as practicable.\n\nF.

No renewal of a temporary variance may remain in effect for longer than one hundred eighty days.\n\nG.
