When the use of earned sick leave is foreseeable, the employee shall make a reasonable effort to provide oral or written notice of the need for such sick leave to the employer in advance of the use of the earned sick leave and shall make a reasonable effort to schedule the use of earned sick leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.
