Att'y Gen. No. 69-116.\n\nNo authority to make new law.— The language of 50-1-5, 50-1-7 NMSA 1978 and this section is aimed at enforcement of existing law rather than the making of new law by way of regulation. 1964 Op.

No. 64-61.\n\nLimited by statutory authority.— Neither the labor commissioner (now director of the labor and industrial division) nor commission (now labor and industrial division) have the statutory authority to prescribe rules and regulations involving industrial safety devices. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-61.\n\nProsecution of wage claims.— The manner of prosecuting wage claims referred to him by the labor commissioner (now director of the labor and industrial division) is left to the judgment of the district attorney.
