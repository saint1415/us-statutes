      "text": "A. An employer in this state shall designate regular pay days, not more than sixteen days apart, as days fixed for the payment of wages to all employees paid in this state. The employer shall pay for services rendered from the first to the fifteenth days, inclusive, of any calendar month by the twenty-fifth day of the month during which services are rendered, and for all services rendered from the sixteenth to the last day of the month, inclusive, of any calendar month by the tenth day of the succeeding month. Where computation of earnings and of amounts due, preparation of payrolls and issuance of paychecks are at a central location outside New Mexico, the employer shall pay for services rendered from the first to the fifteenth days, inclusive, of any calendar month by the last of the month during which services are rendered, and for all services rendered from the sixteenth to the last day of the month, inclusive, of any calendar month by the fifteenth day of the succeeding month.\n\nB. Except as provided by rules of the department of finance and administration for payment of salaries and wages to state employees, other than employees of institutions of higher education, promulgated pursuant to Section 10-7-2 NMSA 1978, an employer shall pay wages in full, less lawful deductions and less payroll deductions authorized by the employer and employee. Wages shall be paid in lawful money of the United States or in checks, payroll vouchers or drafts on banks, convertible into cash on demand at full face value or, with the voluntary authorization of the employer, employee and financial institution, by deposit to the account of the employee in any bank, savings and loan association, credit union or other financial institution authorized by the United States or one of the several states to receive deposits in the United States, without any reduction or deduction, except as may be specifically stated in a written contract of hiring entered into at the time of hiring. An employer shall provide an employee with a written receipt that identifies the employer and sets forth the employee's gross pay, the number of hours worked by the employee, the total wages and benefits earned by the employee and an itemized listing of all deductions withheld from the employee's gross pay. Nothing contained in Sections 50-4-1 through 50-4-12 NMSA 1978 shall in any way limit or prohibit the payment of wages or compensation at more frequent intervals than those set forth in this section. Where the labor or service to be rendered to an employer is recompensed on a task, piece or commission basis or other method of calculating the amount of wages to be paid, other than a definite and fixed amount in cash, the employer and the employee may agree in writing at the time of hiring that the wages shall be paid on a monthly basis, on or before the tenth day of the succeeding calendar month.\n\nC. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A of this section, an employer may pay professional, administrative or executive employees or employees employed in the capacity of outside salesman, as those terms are defined under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, one time per month, excluding those employees whose wages are subject to provisions of collective bargaining agreements.\n\nHistory:Laws 1937, ch. 109, § 2; 1941 Comp., § 57-302; Laws 1949, ch. 117, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 59-3-2; Laws 1975, ch. 223, § 1; 1991, ch. 95, § 1; 1993, ch. 26, § 1; 2005, ch. 93, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For state employees' salaries payable at least semimonthly,see10-7-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor pay period for certified school personnel,see22-10-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor pay period for water masters and assistants,see72-3-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the federal Fair Labor Standards Act referred to in Subsection C,see29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, provides in Subsection B that except as provided by rules of the department of finance and administration for payment of salaries and wages to state employees, other than employees of institutions of higher education, employers shall pay wages in full, less authorized deductions.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, inserted the second sentence of Subsection B.\n\nThe 1991 amendmentadded Subsection C.\n\nPay intervals not more than 30 (now 16) days.— This section requires employers to pay employees at intervals of not more than 30 (now 16) days.Advance Loan Co. v. Kovach, 1968-NMSC-154, 79 N.M. 509, 445 P.2d 386.\n\nMunicipalities not equal to the state for purposes of payment of wages.— Although a municipality may be an auxiliary of the state government, this relationship does not equate municipalities with the state for purposes of benefits and privileges, and therefore the express exclusion of the state in its capacity as an employer from 50-4-2(A) NMSA 1978 does not also exempt municipalities from complying with this section.Rainaldi v. City of Albuquerque, 2014-NMCA-112.\n\nMunicipal employers.— Municipalities, as political subdivisions of the state, are not \"employers\" as defined by the Minimum Wage Act and are therefore exempt from the overtime compensation requirements of the Minimum Wage Act, but when a municipality elects to provide overtime compensation, it must comply with the overtime compensation schedule set forth in this section.Rainaldi v. City of Albuquerque, 2014-NMCA-112.\n\nOvertime wages.— Where the city of Albuquerque delayed compensation of accrued overtime to police officers who received overtime pay accrued during the first week of the particular pay period combined with overtime pay accrued during the second week of the preceding pay period, the city's overtime compensation schedule did not comply with this section, which requires that employees be paid within ten days for all services rendered during the particular pay period.Rainaldi v. City of Albuquerque, 2014-NMCA-112.\n\n\"Banking\" of hours violates this section.— Employer's policy of \"banking\" hours in excess of forty per week and deferring compensation for these hours for a period of up to one year conflicts with the Federal Labor Standards Act and this section, which prohibits employers from withholding compensation for such a lengthy period of time.N.M. Dep't of Labor v. A.C. Elec., Inc., 1998-NMCA-141, 125 N.M. 779, 965 P.2d 363.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —48A Am.

Whenever an employer discharges an employee, the unpaid wages or compensation of such employee, if a fixed and definite amount, and not based on a task, piece, commission basis or other method of calculation, shall, upon demand become due immediately, and the employer shall pay such wages to the employee within five days of such discharge.\n\nB. In all other cases of discharged employees the settlement and payment of wages or compensation shall be made within ten days of such discharge.\n\nC. In case of failure to pay wages or compensation due an employee within the time hereinbefore fixed, the wages and compensation of the employee shall continue from the date of discharge until paid at the same rate the employee received at the time of discharge, and may be recovered in a civil action brought by the employee; provided that the employee shall not be entitled to recover any wages or compensation for any period subsequent to the date of discharge unless he pleads in his complaint and establishes that he made demand within a reasonable time upon his employer at the place designated for payment and payment was refused, provided further that the employee shall not be entitled to recover any wages or compensation for any period subsequent to the sixtieth day after the date of discharge.\n\nHistory:Laws 1937, ch. 109, § 4; 1941 Comp., § 57-304; 1953 Comp., § 59-3-4; Laws 1975, ch. 23, § 1.\n\nPurpose of statutes of limitation.— Statutes of limitation are not only enacted to do away with stale claims, but also to encourage an employee seeking the benefits of the statute to act promptly.Spikes v. Mittry Constr. Co., 295 F.2d 207 (10th Cir. 1961).\n\nWages and commissions separate.— Upon timely payment of fixed and definite wages or compensation employer has no further obligation to employee in relation thereto under this section. However additional commissions not fixed and definite and not paid within 10 days continue to be payable until paid or tender thereof is made by employer.Litteral v. Singer Bus. Machs. Co., 1975-NMSC-015, 87 N.M. 365, 533 P.2d 754.\n\nScope of section.— In an action to exact a penalty from an employer for failure to pay wages, the time limitations of this section control over 37-1-3 NMSA 1978.Spikes v. Mittry Constr. Co., 295 F.2d 207 (10th Cir. 1961).\n\nFailure to comply with statutory conditions.— An employer failed to comply with statutory conditions since it did not pay the amount conceded to be due employees within the times required by this section and since it could not show that it gave written notice of the amount conceded to be due as required by Section 50-4-7 NMSA 1978; giving a payroll check to employees for undisputed wages did not satisfy the latter requirement.Wolf v.

1963, ch. 227, § 2; 1965, ch. 121, § 1; 1967, ch. 188, § 1; 1971, ch. 232, § 1; 1973, ch. 392, § 1; 1975, ch. 71, § 1; 1975 (1st S.S.), ch. 3, § 1; 1977, ch. 214, § 1; 1979, ch. 269, § 1; 1983, ch. 311, § 1; 2007, ch. 46, § 45; 2007, ch. 47, § 1; 2008, ch. 2, § 1; 2019, ch. 114, § 1; 2019, ch. 242, § 2; 2021, ch. 10, § 1.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective June 18, 2021, revised the definition of \"employee\", as used in the Minimum Wage Act, to remove the exception to the minimum wage requirement for secondary school students; and deleted Paragraph C(6) and redesignated former Paragraphs C(7) through C(11) as Paragraphs C(6) through C(10).\n\n2019 Amendments.— Laws 2019, ch. 114, § 1, effective January 1, 2020, removed exemptions from the minimum wage for students regularly enrolled in primary and secondary schools working after school hours or on vacation and for persons eighteen years of age or under who are not graduates of a secondary school; in Subsection C, deleted former Paragraph C(6) and redesignated former Paragraphs C(7) and C(8) as Paragraphs C(6) and C(7), respectively; and deleted former Paragraph C(9) and redesignated former Paragraphs C(10) through C(13) as Paragraphs C(8) through C(11), respectively.\n\nLaws 2019, ch. 242, § 2, effective June 14, 2019, revised the definition of \"employee\" as used in the Minimum Wage Act, and removed the exception of domestic service from wage protections; and in Subsection C, deleted former Paragraph C(1) and redesignated former Paragraphs C(2) through C(1) as Paragraphs C(1) through C(13), respectively.\n\nThe 2008 amendment,effective January 18, 2008, changed the definitions of \"employer\" and \"employee\" to exclude the state or any political subdivision of the state, except that for purposes of Subsection A of 50-4-22 NMSA 1978, the state or any political subdivision of the state is included in the definitions of \"employer\" and \"employee\".\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective January 1, 2008, in Subsection C, deleted Paragraph (10), relating to persons employed by ambulance services; relettered Paragraphs (11) to (13) as Paragraphs (10) to (12); added \"or in milk production\" to Subparagraph (3) of Paragraph (12); and added Paragraph (13) relating to an employee engaged in processing of any agricultural or horticultural commodity.\n\nWorkers' compensation cases not considered in construing meaning of \"work\".— In arguing the meaning of \"work\" in the context of the Minimum Wage Act, workers' compensation cases should not be considered because they deal with statutory definitions which differ from the definitions in the Minimum Wage Act.Garcia v. Am. Furniture Co., 1984-NMCA-090, 101 N.M. 785, 689 P.2d 934, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 686, 687 P.2d 743 and 102 N.M. 7, 690 P.2d 450.\n\nCoaching and managing employer's softball team not equivalent to \"employment\"by that employer for purposes of the Minimum Wage Act.Garcia v. Am. Furniture Co., 1984-NMCA-090, 101 N.M. 785, 689 P.2d 934, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 686, 687 P.2d 743 and 102 N.M. 7, 690 P.2d 450.\n\nMunicipal employers.— Municipalities, as political subdivisions of the state, are not \"employers\" as defined by the Minimum Wage Act and are therefore exempt from the overtime compensation requirements of the act, but when a municipality elects to provide overtime compensation, it must comply with the overtime compensation schedule set forth in 50-4-2 NMSA 1978.Rainaldi v. City of Albuquerque, 2014-NMCA-112.\n\nSubstantial evidence supported finding that worker was administrative employee exempted from the act.Valentine v. Bank of Albuquerque, 1985-NMSC-033, 102 N.M. 489, 697 P.2d 489.\n\nWorker paid on a piecemeal basis was exempt from the overtime provisions of the Minimum Wage Act.— Where a pick-up and delivery truck driver who worked for defendant motor carrier filed an action alleging that she was an employee, rather than an independent contractor, and thus entitled to overtime payments under the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act (MWA), §§ 50-4-19 through 50-4-30 NMSA 1978, and where the evidence established that plaintiff signed a contract that required her to pick up and deliver all packages in the service area each day in exchange for weekly settlement payments and that settlements included payments based on the number of stops and packages picked up and delivered, the number of miles driven, fuel settlements based on fuel price changes in the service area, a subsidy providing an additional stipend based on the number of stops made, and weekly payments, which included a per-package payment for any packages delivered outside the service area, defendant's motion for summary judgment was granted because the MWA explicitly excludes salespersons or employees compensated upon piecework, flat rate schedules or commission basis from its definition of employees covered by the act, and plaintiff was paid a specifically calculated rate per package picked up, per package delivered, per stop made on her route, and per excess mile driven in a given day, logical examples of a piecework compensation system.Armijo v. FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., 405 F. Supp. 3d 1267 (D. N.M. 2019).\n\n\"Bona fide executive, administrative or professional\" defined.— Adopting the federal department of labor's definition of \"administrative, executive, and professional employee\", an employee is an exempt administrative employee, pursuant to 50-4-21(C)(2) NMSA 1978, if the employee is compensated on a salary or fee basis at a rate of not less than $455 per week exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities, if the employee's primary duty is the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer's customers, and if the employee's primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.Williams v. Mann, 2017-NMCA-012.\n\nSubstantial evidence to support finding that employee qualified as an exempt administrative employee.— Where plaintiff brought a claim for unpaid overtime wages under the Minimum Wage Act (MWA), 50-4-19 to 50-4-30 NMSA 1978, the evidence presented at trial that plaintiff's $600 weekly salary was higher than the minimum wage for non-exempt employees under the MWA, that plaintiff's primary duties were related to management or general office operations, and involved the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance, including signing contracts with vendors, that plaintiff held herself out as an office manager, that plaintiff dealt with employee discipline and payroll issues, and that plaintiff managed patient information, including bill collection, insurance collection and payments, provided a substantial evidentiary basis for the district court to conclude that plaintiff was an exempt administrative employee under the MWA, and therefore not entitled to unpaid overtime wages.Williams v. Mann, 2017-NMCA-012.\n\nEmployees compensated on a commission basis are not entitled to overtime wages.— Where plaintiff, a former employee, brought an action on behalf of himself and proposed class against his former employer, alleging violations of New Mexico's Minimum Wage Act (NMMWA) due to employer's failure to pay overtime wages, defendant's motion for summary judgment was granted because defendant compensated plaintiffs on a commission basis, and Subsection C of this section provides that overtime pay requirements do not apply to employees compensated on a commission basis.Corman v. JWS of New Mexico, Inc., 356 F.Supp.3d 1148 (D. N.M. 2018).\n\nPlain language of statute permitted finding that a supervisor could be an \"employer\" for purposes of the Minimum Wage Act.— Where employee, a lease operator, brought a putative class action against employer, an energy company, and a senior superintendent, alleging violations of the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act, 50-4-19 to 50-4-30 NMSA 1978 (act), and where the senior superintendent argued that claims against him should be dismissed because he cannot be an \"employer\" under the act, the motion to dismiss was denied because the plain language of the definition of \"employer\" provides that individuals employed by a company may be an \"employer\" themselves when they take certain actions in relation to employees on behalf of the corporate employer.Anderson v. XTO Energy, Inc., 341 F.Supp.3d 1272 (D. N.M. 2018).\n\nScope of coverage.— A desk clerk is a person employed in an establishment coming within the definition of service establishment. Unless the desk clerk can bring himself within the exceptions of Subsection C, Paragraphs (1) to (12) [now Paragraphs (1) to (7), (10) to (14)], he certainly is a service employee. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6338 (rendered under prior law).\n\nA retail sales clerk, employed for a 48-hour week, paid a minimum weekly wage of $30, plus commissions on sales, is not exempt from the Minimum Wage Act. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-248.\n\nA nonprofit organization, furnishing working mothers with child day care services, where mothers pay for services on the basis of financial ability and the nursery is directed and staffed by a supervisor and several other persons who are paid for their services, creates an employer-employee relationship. The employees are persons who devote full time and energy to providing services for salaries or wages and are not exempt under Subsection C(4) of this section. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-04.\n\nTips may not be included in determining minimum wage.— Bellhops come under the provisions of this section as service employees, entitled to $.50 per hour as a minimum wage, but in the absence of an explicit understanding between parties, tips belong to the bellhop and cannot be included in determining minimum wage. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6309 (rendered under prior law).\n\nNo exemption for irrigation district employees.— If immunity from suit and exemption from taxation are not necessary to carry out the purposes for which irrigation districts are organized, exemption from paying the minimum wage to employees of the district is not necessary for such a purpose. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-90.\n\nUnless employed in agriculture.— Under certain situations one employed to supply water to be used for agricultural purposes may be employed in agriculture and therefore the employer would be exempt from the provisions of the Minimum Wage Act. It is a question of fact whether this would include specific employees of irrigation districts. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-90.\n\nPiece-work basis employees exempt.— The compensation of employees for the separation of mica on the basis of so much per 100 or 200 pounds constitutes the employment of labor on a piece-work basis and is, therefore, exempt from the requirements of the New Mexico wage and hour laws. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-204.\n\nGoodwill workers may not be employees under this section.— Goodwill Industries of New Mexico, Inc., is organized as a nonprofit organization for exclusively religious, charitable and educational purposes. It provides rehabilitation services, training, employment and opportunities for the handicapped, disabled and disadvantaged who are unable to compete in the open labor market. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-02.\n\nTwo businesses not single employer.— The fact that the two businesses occupy proximate premises or even the same premises does not make them a single employing unit. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-173.\n\nHospital employees.— Hospitals did not have to pay their employees the hourly wage rate prescribed by the 1963 Minimum Wage Act because hospital employees were not covered by the minimum wage provision pertaining to \"employees\". 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-67 (rendered under prior law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Public Labor Disputes - A Suggested Approach for New Mexico,\" see 1 N.M. L. Rev. 281 (1971).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— Who is employed in \"professional capacity,\" within exemption, under 29 USCS § 213(a)(1), from minimum wage and maximum hours provisions of Fair Labor Standards Act, 77 A.L.R.

      "text": "A. Except as provided in Subsection C of this section, an employer shall pay to an employee a minimum wage rate of:\n\n(1) prior to January 1, 2020, at least seven dollars fifty cents ($7.50) an hour;\n\n(2) beginning January 1, 2020 and prior to January 1, 2021, at least nine dollars ($9.00) an hour;\n\n(3) beginning January 1, 2021 and prior to January 1, 2022, at least ten dollars fifty cents ($10.50) an hour;\n\n(4) beginning January 1, 2022 and prior to January 1, 2023, at least eleven dollars fifty cents ($11.50) an hour; and\n\n(5) on and after January 1, 2023, at least twelve dollars ($12.00) an hour.\n\nB. An employer furnishing food, utilities, supplies or housing to an employee who is engaged in agriculture may deduct the reasonable value of such furnished items from any wages due to the employee.\n\nC. An employee who customarily and regularly receives more than thirty dollars ($30.00) a month in tips shall be paid a minimum hourly wage as follows:\n\n(1) prior to January 1, 2020, at least two dollars thirteen cents ($2.13) an hour;\n\n(2) beginning January 1, 2020 and prior to January 1, 2021, at least two dollars thirty-five cents ($2.35) an hour;\n\n(3) beginning January 1, 2021 and prior to January 1, 2022, at least two dollars fifty-five cents ($2.55) an hour;\n\n(4) beginning January 1, 2022 and prior to January 1, 2023, at least two dollars eighty cents ($2.80) an hour;\n\n(5) on and after January 1, 2023, at least three dollars ($3.00) an hour; and\n\n(6) the employer may consider tips as part of wages, but the tips combined with the employer's cash wage shall not equal less than the minimum wage rate as provided in Subsection A of this section. All tips received by such employees shall be retained by the employee, except that nothing in this section shall prohibit the pooling of tips among wait staff.\n\nD. An employee shall not be required to work more than forty hours in any week of seven days, unless the employee is paid one and one-half times the employee's regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty hours. For an employee who is paid a fixed salary for fluctuating hours and who is employed by an employer a majority of whose business in New Mexico consists of providing investigative services to the federal government, the hourly rate may be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the regulations pursuant to that act; provided that in no case shall the hourly rate be less than the federal minimum wage.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 59-3-22, enacted by Laws 1955, ch. 200, § 3; 1957, ch. 161, § 1; 1963, ch. 227, § 3; 1965, ch. 121, § 2; 1967, ch. 188, § 2; 1973, ch. 392, § 2; 1975 (1st S.S.), ch. 3, § 2; 1979, ch. 269, § 2; 1983, ch. 59, § 1; 1993, ch. 217, § 1; 1999, ch. 164, § 1; 2003, ch. 262, § 1; 2005, ch. 302, § 1; 2005, ch. 306, § 1; 2007, ch. 47, § 2; 2019, ch. 114, § 2; 2021, ch. 10, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For time-and-a-half for more than 40 hours for females,see50-5-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor time-and-a-half for more than 48 hours for females,see50-5-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor time-and-a-half for more than 56 hours for female transportation company employees,see50-5-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the federal Fair Labor Standards Act,see29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective June 18, 2021, removed the lower minimum wage requirement for secondary school students; in Subsection A, after \"Subsection\", changed \"B or D\" to \"C\"; and deleted former Subsection B and redesignated former Subsections C through E as Subsections B through D, respectively.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective January 1, 2020, raised the minimum wage, and provided a separate minimum wage for employed secondary school students; deleted former Subsection A and added new Subsections A and B and redesignated former Subsections B through D as Subsections C through E, respectively; in Subsection D, in the introductory clause, after \"hourly wage\", deleted \"of two dollars thirteen cents ($2.13). The\" and added \"as follows\", added Paragraphs D(1) through D(5) and new paragraph designation \"(6)\", and in Paragraph D(6), after \"pooling of tips among\", deleted \"employees\" and added \"wait staff\".\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective January 1, 2008, in Subsection A, increased the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.50 an hour, effective January 1, 2008 and from $6.50 to $7.50, effective January 1, 2009.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, changed the minimum hourly wage of employees who receive more than $30 a month in tips from $2.125 to $2.13 in Subsection B; deleted the former provision in Subsection B that an employer may consider tips a part of wages, but not to exceed fifty percent of the minimum wage, and provided in Subsection B that tips may be considered part of wages, but tips combined with the employer's cash wage shall not equal less than $5.60 per hour.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, substituted \"five dollars fifteen cents ($5.15)\" for \"four dollars twenty-five cents ($4.25)\" near the middle of Subsection A.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, added the last sentence in Subsection C and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, rewrote this section to the extent that a detailed comparison is impracticable.\n\nMeaning of \"any week of seven days\".— The phrase \"any week of seven days\" in Subsection C of Section 50-4-22 NMSA 1978 means a fixed and regularly recurring workweek established by the employer consistent with the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Fair Labor Standards Act.Sinclaire v. Elderhostel, Inc., 2012-NMCA-100, 287 P.3d 978.\n\nWhere defendant's established workweek was from 12:01 a.m. Sunday to midnight the following Saturday; plaintiff led educational tours for defendant, some of which corresponded with the Sunday to Saturday workweek and some of which began on Wednesday and concluded the following Wednesday; if plaintiff worked from Wednesday to Wednesday, plaintiff received two hours of overtime in the first Sunday to Saturday workweek and eight hours of overtime in the in the second workweek; if plaintiff worked more than forty hours during a Sunday to Saturday week, plaintiff received time and a half for each hour over forty hours; and plaintiff claimed that defendant should have paid plaintiff overtime based on the seven-day week plaintiff actually worked, rather than on the Sunday to Saturday workweek, defendant's establishment of the fixed Sunday to Saturday workweek qualified as a \"week of seven days\" under Subsection C of Section 50-4-22 NMSA 1978.Sinclaire v. Elderhostel, Inc., 2012-NMCA-100, 287 P.3d 978.\n\nPlaintiff's claim survived dismissal where it was alleged that he routinely worked over forty hours and was denied overtime pay.— In a federal class action lawsuit, where plaintiff claimed that defendant employer regularly scheduled class members to work for a minimum of 12 hours per day and a minimum of 84 hours per week, that class members routinely worked over 80 hours per week, and that defendant failed to pay class members any overtime premium for all hours worked in excess of 40 per workweek, and where defendant moved to dismiss, claiming that plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to support a reasonable inference that plaintiff received less than the overtime pay due because plaintiff failed to identify a specific workweek in which he worked more than 40 hours and was denied overtime pay, plaintiff was not required to specify a particular workweek in which he worked more than 40 hours because plaintiff alleged that the general length of hours worked in a week was over 84 hours, well above the 40-hour threshold, and this provides defendant with a sufficient factual context to nudge plaintiff's claim from conceivable to plausible to state a claim for relief for failure to pay overtime as required by theMinimum Wage Act. Gandy v. RWLS, LLC, 308 F.Supp.3d 1220 (D.N.M. 2018).\n\nContract for diminishing overtime wages.— An employer and employee may not agree to a fluctuating rate of pay, pursuant to which the employee is paid a fixed weekly salary plus an overtime factor of one-half of the hourly rate, which hourly rate is calculated such that it decreases as the number of hours worked increases because the agreement conflicts with the prohibition against overtime paid at less than time and a half.N.M. Dep't of Labor v. Echostar Commc'ns Corp., 2006-NMCA-047, 139 N.M. 493, 134 P.3d 780, cert. quashed, 2006-NMCERT-010, 140 N.M. 675, 146 P.3d 810.\n\n\"Required to work\" includes subtle pressures.— Overtime pay is mandatory when an employee covered by the Minimum Wage Act (Section 50-4-19 NMSA 1978 et seq.) works more than forty hours in a seven-day week with the employer's knowledge and consent, and where there is any pressure by the employer, however subtle, to perform such work.N.M. Dep't of Labor v. A.C. Elec., Inc., 1998-NMCA-141, 125 N.M. 779, 965 P.2d 363.\n\n\"Banked\" time off violates minimum wage laws.— Employer cannot avoid overtime payments to employees by offering them \"banked\" time off in exchange for working uncompensated overtime.N.M. Dep't of Labor v. A.C. Elec., Inc., 1998-NMCA-141, 125 N.M. 779, 965 P.2d 363.\n\nConditional class certification under the Minimum Wage Act.— Where plaintiffs, five non-exempt employees of a non-profit, integrated acute care hospital, brought a putative collective and class action alleging that their employer failed to pay plaintiffs and other non-exempt employees for time they spent working during meal breaks in violation of the Minimum Wage Act (MWA), the district court erred in denying plaintiffs' motion to conditionally certify a collective action, because plaintiffs' allegations, supported by affidavits, that the putative class was sometimes required to work through meal breaks, but not compensated for such work, and that such potential violations of the MWA stemmed from a single policy or plan to not only schedule workers in such a way that missing meal periods was sometimes unavoidable, but also to discourage employees from using the \"no lunch\" button that would have resulted in full compensation for time worked, satisfy the minimal standards associated with the notice stage determination of whether plaintiffs are similarly situated.Sloane v. Rehoboth McKinley Christian Health Care Servs., 2018-NMCA-048.\n\nMunicipal employers.— Municipalities, as political subdivisions of the state, are not \"employers\" as defined by the Minimum Wage Act and are therefore exempt from the overtime compensation requirements of the act, but when a municipality elects to provide overtime compensation, it must comply with the overtime compensation schedule set forth in 50-4-2 NMSA 1978.Rainaldi v. City of Albuquerque, 2014-NMCA-112.\n\nAdministrative employee not entitled to unpaid overtime.— Where plaintiff brought a claim for unpaid overtime wages under the Minimum Wage Act (MWA), 50-4-19 to -30 NMSA 1978, the evidence presented at trial that plaintiff's $600 weekly salary was higher than the minimum wage for non-exempt employees under the MWA, that plaintiff's primary duties were related to management or general office operations, and involved the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance, including signing contracts with vendors, that plaintiff held herself out as an office manager, that plaintiff dealt with employee discipline and payroll issues, and that plaintiff managed patient information, including bill collection, insurance collection and payments, provided a substantial evidentiary basis for the district court to conclude that plaintiff was an exempt administrative employee under the MWA, and therefore not entitled to unpaid overtime wages.Williams v. Mann, 2017-NMCA-012.\n\nPenalty provision applies to both minimum wage and overtime claims.— When 50-4-26(C) NMSA 1978 refers to \"minimum wages\" in its plural form, particularly where it follows the broad \"any provision\" introductory language, it is clear that the legislature contemplated an award of liquidated damages to both minimum wage and overtime claimants bringing a claim under any provision of 50-4-22 NMSA 1978.Armijo v. FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., 285 F.Supp.3d 1209 (D.N.M. 2018).\n\nWhere plaintiff executed a contract with defendant to work as a \"pickup and delivery contractor\", and where plaintiff, after three years as a contractor, brought a claim against defendant, alleging that defendant violated the Minimum Wage Act, §§ 50-4-19 through -30 NMSA 1978, by failing to pay drivers overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in one week, defendant's claim that § 50-4-26(C) NMSA 1978 applies only to violations of the minimum wage provisions, not to the overtime provisions of § 50-4-22 NMSA 1978, was without merit, because the plural \"minimum wages\" language in § 50-4-26(C) NMSA 1978 provides for damages for claimants bringing a claim under \"any provision\" of § 50-4-22 NMSA 1978.Armijo v. FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., 285 F.Supp.3d 1209 (D.N.M. 2018).\n\nAct not preempted by federal law or collective bargaining agreement.— New Mexico Minimum Wage Act (Section 50-4-19 NMSA 1978 et seq.) claims brought by union workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement were not preempted by Section 301 of the Labor Management Act, 29 U.S.C. § 185 and were not preempted by the remedies provided by the agreement; the claims were based on non-negotiable state law rights which could be resolved independently of the labor agreement.Self v. UPS, 1998-NMSC-046, 126 N.M. 396, 970 P.2d 582.\n\nTravel time is not compensable under the Minimum Wage Act.— The general rule is that commuting time to and from a job site is not compensable absent an agreement to the contrary. The Minimum Wage Act, being silent on travel time, does not create an exception to the general rule.Segura v. J.W. Drilling, Inc., 2015-NMCA-085, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nWhere employees claimed that employer failed to pay them for overtime wages for the time spent traveling from their homes to employer's job sites, the New Mexico court of appeals declined to deviate from the general rule that commuting time to and from a job site is not compensable when the Minimum Wage Act is silent on travel time.Segura v. J.W. Drilling, Inc., 2015-NMCA-085, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —48A Am.

The director of the labor relations division of the workforce solutions department shall enforce and prosecute violations of the Minimum Wage Act. The director may institute in the name of the state an action in the district court of the county wherein the employer who has failed to comply with the Minimum Wage Act resides or has a principal office or place of business, for the purpose of prosecuting violations. The district attorney for the district wherein any violation hereof occurs shall aid and assist the director in the prosecution.\n\nC. In addition to penalties provided pursuant to this section, an employer who violates any provision of Section 50-4-22 NMSA 1978 shall be liable to the employees affected in the amount of their unpaid or underpaid minimum wages plus interest, and in an additional amount equal to twice the unpaid or underpaid wages.\n\nD.

In addition to any remedy or punishment provided pursuant to the Minimum Wage Act, a court may order appropriate injunctive relief, including requiring an employer to post in the place of business a notice describing violations by the employer as found by the court or a copy of a cease and desist order applicable to the employer.\n\nG.

At the initial notice stage determination of whether plaintiffs are similarly situated, the plaintiff need only present substantial allegations that the putative class members were together the victims of a single decision, policy or plan. At the second stage, the court must revisit the initial determination by considering whether the class members have disparate factual and employment settings; whether the available defenses to the claims are individual to each class member; and whether there are any fairness or procedural considerations relevant to the action.Armijo v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 2007-NMCA-120, 142 N.M. 557, 168 P.3d 129, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-009, 142 N.M. 715, 169 P.3d 408.\n\nInitial notice stage determination of whether plaintiffs are similarly situated.— Where plaintiffs, five non-exempt employees of a non-profit, integrated acute care hospital, brought a putative collective and class action alleging that their employer failed to pay plaintiffs and other non-exempt employees for time they spent working during meal breaks in violation of the Minimum Wage Act (MWA), the district court erred in denying plaintiffs' motion to conditionally certify a collective action, because plaintiffs' allegations, supported by affidavits, that the putative class was sometimes required to work through meal breaks, but not compensated for such work, and that such potential violations of the MWA stemmed from a single policy or plan to not only schedule workers in such a way that missing meal periods was sometimes unavoidable, but also to discourage employees from using the \"no lunch\" button that would have resulted in full compensation for time worked, satisfy the minimal standards associated with the notice stage determination of whether plaintiffs are similarly situated.Sloane v. Rehoboth McKinley Christian Health Care Servs., 2018-NMCA-048.\n\nPenalty provision in subsection C applies to both minimum wage and overtime claims.— When 50-4-26(C) NMSA 1978 refers to \"minimum wages\" in its plural form, particularly where it follows the broad \"any provision\" introductory language, it is clear that the legislature contemplated an award of liquidated damages to both minimum wage and overtime claimants bringing a claim under any provision of 50-4-22 NMSA 1978.Armijo v. FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., 285 F.Supp.3d 1209 (D.N.M. 2018).\n\nWhere plaintiff executed a contract with defendant to work as a \"pickup and delivery contractor\", and where plaintiff, after three years as a contractor, brought a claim against defendant, alleging that defendant violated the Minimum Wage Act, §§ 50-4-19 through -30 NMSA 1978 by failing to pay drivers overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in one week, defendant's claim that § 50-4-26(C) NMSA 1978 applies only to violations of the minimum wage provisions, not to the overtime provisions of § 50-4-22 NMSA 1978, was without merit, because the plural \"minimum wages\" language in § 50-4-26(C) NMSA 1978 provides for damages for claimants bringing a claim under \"any provision\" of § 50-4-22 NMSA 1978.Armijo v. FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., 285 F.Supp.3d 1209 (D.N.M. 2018).\n\nWage collection authority.— This article and article 4 of this chapter do not specifically provide the division with the authority to issue judgments or warrants for the collection of wages due; rather, these statutes simply allow the division to prosecute a wage collection action in magistrate court or district court if it determines that an employee's wage claim is \"valid and enforceable.\"Southworth v. Santa Fe Servs. Inc., 1998-NMCA-109, 125 N.M. 489, 963 P.2d 566.\n\nSummary judgment erroneous in wage claim.— Employer's affidavit that employee was salaried, and thus not entitled to overtime, and had not accrued vacation time under her employment contract and employer's vacation policy, combined with a copy of the employment contract and other documentation, was sufficient to establish that there were disputed issues of fact concerning employer's liability for overtime and vacation pay which precluded summary judgment.Southworth v. Santa Fe Servs. Inc., 1998-NMCA-109, 125 N.M. 489, 963 P.2d 566.\n\nStandard of review.— Action under Subsection B was separate from employee's administrative action brought before labor department; it was not a substitute for an appeal and thus the district court was not required to apply the whole-record standard of review applicable to a review of an administrative decision.Southworth v. Santa Fe Servs. Inc., 1998-NMCA-109, 125 N.M. 489, 963 P.2d 566.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —48A Am. Jur. 2d Labor and Labor Relations § 4188 et seq.\n\n73A C.J.S.

      "text": "A. The purpose of this section is to authorize family child care providers to organize and to use collective bargaining on all matters specified in this section. It is the intent of the legislature that the state action exemption to the application of federal and state antitrust laws be fully available to the extent that the activities of the family child care providers and their representatives are authorized under this section.\n\nB. Family child care providers shall have the right to form, join or assist a labor organization for the purpose of collective bargaining through representatives chosen by family child care providers without interference, restraint or coercion and shall have the right to refuse any such activities.\n\nC. The exclusive representative may be selected by mail ballot election conducted by a reputable organization with experience in conducting representation elections. In order for an election to occur, a representative or representative organization shall have collected signed cards from at least thirty percent of affected family child care providers indicating their desire for representation. The organization conducting the election shall establish procedures to ensure the secrecy of any ballot cast in any election held pursuant to this section. Costs of the election shall be borne by the labor organization seeking exclusive representative status. The providers in the unit shall be offered the opportunity to choose between the following:\n\n(1) representation by the provider organization; or\n\n(2) no representation.\n\nD. Within ten days of receiving authorization cards requesting a mail-in ballot election, the children, youth and families department or another appropriate state agency shall submit a list verifying all eligible family child care providers in the state to the organization making the request.\n\nE. A labor organization that has been certified through the process as representing the family child care providers shall be the exclusive representative for all family child care providers for the purposes of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with the children, youth and families department.\n\nF. The children, youth and families department shall meet with the family child care providers and their exclusive representative with the purpose of entering into a written agreement that shall be binding upon both the state and the exclusive representative. The written agreement shall include a binding arbitration procedure, a grievance process, the creation of a labor-management committee that will meet regularly to discuss concerns and issues as they arise and mechanisms for dues collection.\n\nG. Topics of negotiations shall include terms and conditions under which family child care providers provide child care in their homes and in the homes of parents, including reimbursement rates and payment procedures for publicly funded care, health and safety conditions, the monitoring and evaluating of family child care homes, licensing and other fees, quality rating standards, training and certification requirements and any other matters that would improve recruitment and retention of qualified family child care providers and the quality of the programs they provide. The labor organization and the state agency shall work together to explore systems for family child care providers to have access to affordable, comprehensive health insurance coverage.\n\nH. An agreement provision by the state and the exclusive representative that requires the expenditure of funds shall be contingent upon the specific appropriation of funds by the legislature and the availability of funds.\n\nI. In order to ensure that the children, youth and families department's mandate for quality measures continues for all licensed providers of child care services, the department shall ensure the adequate allocation of appropriated funds to those providing the highest-quality care, including licensed centers and licensed family child care providers.\n\nJ. Should the parties be unable to reach an agreement, the parties shall follow the impasse resolution procedure as outlined in the Public Employee Bargaining Act [Chapter 10, Article 7E NMSA 1978].\n\nK. The children, youth and families department shall not:\n\n(1) discriminate or knowingly allow any other organizations with which the children, youth and families department contracts to administer services related to child care to discriminate against a family child care provider with regard to the terms and conditions of its relationship with the provider because of the provider's membership in a labor organization;\n\n(2) take negative action against a family child care provider or knowingly allow any other organizations with which the children, youth and families department contracts to administer services related to child care to take negative action because the provider has signed or filed an affidavit, petition, grievance or complaint or given information or testimony or because the provider is forming, joining or choosing to be represented by a labor organization;\n\n(3) refuse to bargain collectively in good faith with the labor organization; or\n\n(4) refuse to comply with a collective bargaining agreement reached with the labor organization pursuant to this section.\n\nL. The labor organization shall not:\n\n(1) discriminate against a family child care provider with regard to labor organization membership because of race, color, religion, creed, age, sex or national origin;\n\n(2) refuse to bargain collectively in good faith with the children, youth and families department; or\n\n(3) refuse to comply with a collective bargaining agreement reached with the children, youth and families department pursuant to this section.\n\nM. If either party believes a provision of this section has been violated, the parties shall follow the public employee labor relations board's rules of prohibited practice proceedings.\n\nN. By entering into an agreement, the children, youth and families department and the exclusive representative do not intend to interfere with parental rights to select or deselect family child care providers to provide care for children.\n\nO. In enacting bargaining rights for family child care providers, the state intends to provide state action immunity under federal and state antitrust laws for the activities of family child care providers and their exclusive bargaining representative to the extent such activities are authorized by this section.\n\nP. A family child care provider or an employee of a family child care provider is not a public employee for purposes of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 to 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].\n\nQ. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"exclusive representative\" means a labor organization that, as a result of certification, has the right to represent family child care providers in an appropriate bargaining unit for the purposes of collective bargaining;\n\n(2) \"family child care provider\" means a person who provides care services and supervision for children in the provider's own home under regulations established by the children, youth and families department and who is:\n\n(a) licensed by the state and is a vendor in the state and federal child care assistance program; or\n\n(b) registered with the state to participate in the child and adult care food program and is a vendor in the state and federal child care assistance program; and\n\n(3) \"labor organization\" means a family child care provider organization whose purposes include the representation of family child care providers in collective bargaining and in otherwise meeting, consulting and conferring with the children, youth and families department on matters pertaining to family child care provider relations.\n\nR. If any part or application of this section is held invalid, the remainder or its application to other situations or persons shall not be affected.\n\nHistory:Laws 2009, ch. 238, § 1.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2009, ch. 238 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M.
