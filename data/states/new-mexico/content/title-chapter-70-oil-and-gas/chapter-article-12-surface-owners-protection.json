Damages to the range do not exclude all damages to the surface of the land, and plaintiffs' complaint was sufficient to place defendants on notice that plaintiffs were seeking damages provided for in the permits and leases, which provided that defendants must settle with and compensate state land office surface lessees for actual damages to or loss of livestock, authorized improvements, range, crops, and other valid existing rights recognized by law.Woody Inv., LLC v.
