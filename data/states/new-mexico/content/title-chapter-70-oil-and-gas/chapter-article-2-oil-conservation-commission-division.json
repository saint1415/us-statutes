      "text": "The production or handling of crude petroleum oil or natural gas of any type or in any form, or the handling of products thereof, in such manner or under such conditions or in such amounts as to constitute or result in waste is each hereby prohibited.\n\nHistory:Laws 1935, ch. 72, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 69-202; Laws 1949, ch. 168, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 65-3-2.\n\nCross references.— For regulation and conservation of carbon dioxide gas,see70-2-34 NMSA 1978.\n\nLegislative intent.— Primary concern of oil and gas legislation is eliminating and preventing waste in the pool so far as it can practicably be done, and also the protection of correlative rights of producers from the pool.El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1966-NMSC-092, 76 N.M. 268, 414 P.2d 496.\n\nTwo fundamental powers and duties of commissionare prevention of waste and protection of correlative rights.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nElements of property rights of natural gas owners.— The legislature has stated definitively the elements contained in property rights of natural gas owners. Such right is not absolute or unconditional. It consists of merely (1) an opportunity to produce, (2) only insofar as it is practicable to do so, (3) without waste, (4) a proportion, (5) insofar as it can be practically determined and obtained without waste, (6) of gas in the pool.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nProtection of correlative rights.— Although subservient to prevention of waste and perhaps to practicalities of the situation, the protection of correlative rights must depend upon the commission's findings as to the extent and limitations of the right. This the commission is required to do under legislative mandate.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nKeeping of false records actionable offense.— The Connally Hot Oil Act (15 U.S.C. § 715 et seq.) applies only to those states which have in effect proration statutes for the purpose of preventing waste of oil and gas resources, encouraging conservation of oil and gas deposits, etc., and New Mexico is among those states which has enacted a valid comprehensive oil conservation law; since Connally Act applies to this state, keeping of false records, though not in violation of any New Mexico proration order, constitutes an actionable offense under Connally Act.Humble Oil & Ref. Co. v. U.S., 198 F.2d 753 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 909, 73 S. Ct. 328, 97 L. Ed. 701 (1952).\n\nForfeiture of lease denied.— Lessors of oil and gas lease could not declare balance of 40-acre tract (i.e., all except 10-acre tract a producing well was on) retained after selling interests without reservation in another undrilled 40-acre area included in the original lease, as forfeited because of lease provision that lessee was to drill or start to drill a second well or forfeit the lease, in view of order promulgated pursuant to this act which prevented drilling of second well on the retained 40-acre tract.Thompson v. Greer, 1951-NMSC-050, 55 N.M. 335, 233 P.2d 204.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Compulsory Pooling of Oil and Gas Interests in New Mexico,\" see 3 Nat. Res.

Such excess production causes or results in waste which is prohibited by this act. The words \"reasonable market demand,\" as used herein with respect to crude petroleum oil, shall be construed to mean the demand for such crude petroleum oil for reasonable current requirements for current consumption and use within or outside the state, together with the demand for such amounts as are reasonably necessary for building up or maintaining reasonable storage reserves of crude petroleum oil or the products thereof, or both such crude petroleum oil and products;\n\nD. the nonratable purchase or taking of crude petroleum oil in this state. Such nonratable taking and purchasing causes or results in waste, as defined in the Subsections A, B, C of this section and causes waste by violating Section 12(a) [70-2-16A NMSA 1978] of this act;\n\nE. the production in this state of natural gas from any gas well or wells, or from any gas pool, in excess of the reasonable market demand from such source for natural gas of the type produced or in excess of the capacity of gas transportation facilities for such type of natural gas. The words \"reasonable market demand,\" as used herein with respect to natural gas, shall be construed to mean the demand for natural gas for reasonable current requirements, for current consumption and for use within or outside the state, together with the demand for such amounts as are necessary for building up or maintaining reasonable storage reserves of natural gas or products thereof, or both such natural gas and products;\n\nF. drilling or producing operations for oil or gas within any area containing commercial deposits of potash where such operations would have the effect unduly to reduce the total quantity of such commercial deposits of potash which may reasonably be recovered in commercial quantities or where such operations would interfere unduly with the orderly commercial development of such potash deposits.\n\nHistory:Laws 1935, ch. 72, § 2; 1941, ch. 166, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 69-203; Laws 1949, ch. 168, § 2; 1953 Comp., § 65-3-3; Laws 1965, ch. 58, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The term \"this act,\" referred to in this section, means Laws 1935, ch. 72, §§ 1 to 24, which appear as 70-2-2 to 70-2-4, 70-2-6 to 70-2-11, 70-2-15, 70-2-16, 70-2-21 to 70-2-25, 70-2-27 to 70-2-30, 70-2-33 NMSA 1978.\n\nCross references.— For definitions,see70-2-33 NMSA 1978.\n\nAllowable production not to exceed market demand.— When 70-2-16C and 70-2-19E NMSA 1978 are read together, one fact is evident: even after a pool is prorated, market demand must be determined, since, if allowable production from the pool exceeds market demand, waste would result if the allowable is produced.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nChange of allowable production to meet market demand.— The enabling of gas purchasers to more nearly meet market demand is not an authorized statutory basis upon which a change of allowable production may be placed.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Compulsory Pooling of Oil and Gas Interests in New Mexico,\" see 3 Nat. Res.

Any member of the commission or the director of the oil conservation division or any employee of the commission or division shall have power to administer oaths to any witness in any hearing, investigation or proceeding contemplated by the Oil and Gas Act or by any other law of this state relating to the conservation of oil and gas.\n\nHistory:Laws 1935, ch. 72, § 3; 1941 Comp., § 69-204; Laws 1949, ch. 168, § 3; 1953 Comp., § 65-3-4; Laws 1975, ch. 289, § 13; 1977, ch. 255, § 39; 1987, ch. 234, § 58.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective July 1, 1987, in the first sentence, substituted \"a designee of the commissioner of public lands, a designee of the secretary of energy, minerals and natural resources\" for \"the commissioner of public lands, the state geologist and the director of oil conservation division\", inserted the present second sentence, and made minor changes in language and punctuation throughout the section.\n\nJudicial decisions preclusive.— Commission was acting in a judicial capacity when it approved a proposed unitization plan; its decision was therefore entitled to preclusive effect.Amoco Prod. Co. v. Heimann, 904 F.2d 1405 (10th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 942, 111 S. Ct. 350, 112 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1990).\n\nFormer Oil Conservation Act was not unconstitutionalon ground that since legislature had named the members of the commission there had been an invasion of the executive power of appointment in violation of N.M. Const., art. III, § 1. 1951 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 51-5397.\n\nAppointments contemplated in the former Oil Conservation Act were appointments \"otherwise provided for\" as those words are used in N.M. Const., art. V, § 5, and did not invade governor's power of appointment. 1951 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 51-5397.\n\nFormer Oil Conservation Act was not violative of N.M. Const., art. IV, § 16 for failure to have the subject matter expressed clearly in the title. 1951 Op. Att'y Gen.

It has jurisdiction over matters related to conservation of oil and gas in New Mexico, but the basis of its powers is founded on the duty to prevent waste and to protect correlative rights. Prevention of waste is its paramount power, inasmuch as this is an integral part of the definition of correlative rights.Sims v. Mechem, 1963-NMSC-103, 72 N.M. 186, 382 P.2d 183.\n\nJudicial powers.— Commission was acting in a judicial capacity when it approved a proposed unitization plan; its decision was therefore entitled to preclusive effect.Amoco Prod.

Ed. 2d 314 (1990).\n\nAuthority held not exceeded.— When an oil well was located so that it could produce oil from the top portion of the pool, thereby avoiding waste that would have occurred unless the well was allowed, but the well was located so that it could effectively drain the entire pool, and the oil conservation commission, charged with the protection of correlative rights of the other lease owners in the pool, placed a production penalty on the well to protect these rights, the commission did not exceed the broad statutory authority granted by the Oil and Gas Act.Santa Fe Exploration Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1992-NMSC-044, 114 N.M. 103, 835 P.2d 819.\n\nRestrictions on commission's powers.— The power and authority of the commission is general in nature but commission is restricted to the end that it cannot act arbitrarily, unlawfully or capriciously in carrying out administrative functions imposed upon it. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-186.\n\nUse of rental funds for commission's aircraft.— Commission, when it rents its department aircraft to other state agencies, may retain rental payments, when made, in a fund to be used by commission to defray expense of continued operation of the aircraft by placing rental payments in a working capital fund set up in department for the purpose of defraying operating expenses of aircraft. 1959 Op.

To that end, the division is empowered to make and enforce rules, regulations and orders, and to do whatever may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of this act, whether or not indicated or specified in any section hereof.\n\nB. The commission shall have concurrent jurisdiction and authority with the division to the extent necessary for the commission to perform its duties as required by law.\n\nHistory:Laws 1935, ch. 72, § 9; 1941 Comp., § 69-210; Laws 1949, ch. 168, § 9; 1953 Comp., § 65-3-10; Laws 1977, ch. 255, § 46.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The term \"this act,\" referred to in this section, means Laws 1935, ch. 72, §§ 1 to 24, which appear as 70-2-2 to 70-2-4, 70-2-6 to 70-2-11, 70-2-15, 70-2-16, 70-2-21 to 70-2-25, 70-2-27 to 70-2-30, 70-2-33 NMSA 1978.\n\nNo authority to assess civil penalties.— Neither the oil conservation commission nor the oil conservation division has the statutory authority to assess civil penalties because 70-2-28 NMSA 1978 requires the attorney general to bring an action to establish liability and assess penalties for violations of the Oil and Gas Act, 70-2-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., or related rules or orders.Marbob Energy Corp. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 2009-NMSC-013, 146 N.M. 24, 206 P.3d 135.\n\nAuthority based on power of prevention of waste.— The statutory authority of the commission to pool property or to modify existing agreements relating to production within a pool under either 70-2-17C or 70-2-17E NMSA 1978 must be predicated on prevention of waste.Sims v. Mechem, 1963-NMSC-103, 72 N.M. 186, 382 P.2d 183.\n\nCommission has jurisdiction over matters related to conservation of oil and gas in New Mexico, but the basis of its powers is founded on the duty to prevent waste and to protect correlative rights, as set forth in this section.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nPowers of proration and creation of spacing units remain intact.— The standards of preventing waste and protecting correlative rights, as laid out in this section, are sufficient to allow commission's power to prorate and create standard or nonstandard spacing units to remain intact, and 70-2-18 NMSA 1978 is not an unlawful delegation of legislative power.Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1975-NMSC-006, 87 N.M. 286, 532 P.2d 582.\n\nPrevention of waste by pooling.— Commission's finding that most efficient and orderly development of the subject acreage could be accomplished by force pooling is not equivalent to a finding that this pooling will prevent waste.Sims v. Mechem, 1963-NMSC-103, 72 N.M. 186, 382 P.2d 183.\n\nProtection of correlative rights.— The prevention of waste is of paramount interest to the legislature and protection of correlative rights is interrelated and inseparable from it. The very definition of \"correlative rights\" emphasizes the term \"without waste.\" However, protection of correlative rights is a necessary adjunct to the prevention of waste.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nAlthough subservient to prevention of waste and perhaps to practicalities of the situation, protection of correlative rights must depend upon the commission's findings as to extent and limitations of right. This the commission is required to do under legislative mandate.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nProperty rights of natural gas owners.— The legislature has stated definitively the elements contained in property right of natural gas owners. Such right is not absolute or unconditional. It consists of merely (1) an opportunity to produce, (2) only insofar as it is practicable to do so, (3) without waste, (4) a proportion, (5) insofar as it can be practically determined and obtained without waste, (6) of gas in the pool.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nAuthority held not exceeded.— When an oil well was located so that it could produce oil from the top portion of the pool, thereby avoiding waste that would have occurred unless the well was allowed, but the well was located so that it could effectively drain the entire pool, and the oil conservation commission, charged with the protection of correlative rights of the other lease owners in the pool, placed a production penalty on the well to protect these rights, the commission did not exceed the broad statutory authority granted by the Oil and Gas Act.Santa Fe Exploration Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1992-NMSC-044, 114 N.M. 103, 835 P.2d 819.\n\nThe judicial branch is precluded from interfering with administrative rule-making proceedings.— A court may not intervene in rule-making proceedings before the adoption of a rule or regulation, because the separation of powers doctrine forbids a court from prematurely interfering with the administrative processes created by the legislature, and therefore pending appeals of the New Mexico oil conservation commission's rules did not preclude the commission from exercising its authority to promulgate additional rules.Earthworks' Oil & Gas Accountability Project v. N.M. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 2016-NMCA-055, cert. denied.\n\nRequirements for adopting new rules.— In adopting a new rule, an administrative agency is required to provide a statement of reasons for doing so, and the law requires only that the public and the reviewing courts are informed as to the reasoning behind the new rule, so where the New Mexico oil conservation commission (commission) adopted a rule in 2013 that differed from a rule adopted in 2008, despite being based on identical evidence, the new rule was not arbitrary and capricious where the commission enumerated its reasons for adopting the 2013 rule, gave detailed explanations for the standards and requirements that it created in the 2013 rule and, in its order promulgating the rule, provided additional basis for, and reasoning behind, adopting the 2013 rule. Petitioners failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that the 2013 rule is not reasonably related to the commission's legislative purpose.Earthworks' Oil & Gas Accountability Project v. N.M. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 2016-NMCA-055, cert. denied.\n\nFormer act to prohibit waste.— There was no delegation to the commission of power to make law or determine what it shall be in the former Oil Conservation Act, but act was, in effect, a prohibition against waste. 1951 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 51-5397.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment on Cont'l Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809 (1962), see 3 Nat. Res. J. 178 (1963).\n\nAm.

      "text": "A. Each person, firm, corporation or association who operates any oil, gas or service well within the state shall, as a condition precedent to drilling or producing the well, furnish financial assurance in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit or a cash or surety bond or a well-specific plugging insurance policy pursuant to the provisions of this section to the oil conservation division of the energy, minerals and natural resources department running to the benefit of the state and conditioned that the well be plugged and abandoned in compliance with the rules of the oil conservation division. The oil conservation division shall establish categories of financial assurance after notice and hearing. Such categories shall include a blanket plugging financial assurance, which shall be set by rule in an amount not to exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000), a blanket plugging financial assurance for temporarily abandoned status wells, which shall be set by rule at amounts greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), and one-well plugging financial assurance in amounts determined sufficient to reasonably pay the cost of plugging the wells covered by the financial assurance. In establishing categories of financial assurance, the oil conservation division shall consider the depth of the well involved, the length of time since the well was produced, the cost of plugging similar wells and such other factors as the oil conservation division deems relevant. The oil conservation division shall require a one-well financial assurance on any well that has been held in a temporarily abandoned status for more than two years or, at the election of the operator, may allow an operator to increase its blanket plugging financial assurance to cover wells held in temporarily abandoned status. All financial assurance shall remain in force until released by the oil conservation division. The oil conservation division shall release financial assurance when it is satisfied the conditions of the financial assurance have been fully performed.\n\nB. If any of the requirements of the Oil and Gas Act or the rules promulgated pursuant to that act have not been complied with, the oil conservation division, after notice and hearing, may order any well plugged and abandoned by the operator or surety or both in accordance with division rules. If the order is not complied with in the time period set out in the order, the financial assurance shall be forfeited.\n\nC. When any financial assurance is forfeited pursuant to the provisions of the Oil and Gas Act or rules promulgated pursuant to that act, the director of the oil conservation division shall give notice to the attorney general, who shall collect the forfeiture without delay.\n\nD. All forfeitures shall be deposited in the state treasury in the oil and gas reclamation fund.\n\nE. When the financial assurance proves insufficient to cover the cost of plugging oil and gas wells on land other than federal land and funds must be expended from the oil and gas reclamation fund to meet the additional expenses, the oil conservation division is authorized to bring suit against the operator in the district court of the county in which the well is located for indemnification for all costs incurred by the oil conservation division in plugging the well. All funds collected pursuant to a judgment in a suit for indemnification brought under the provisions of this section shall be deposited in the oil and gas reclamation fund.\n\nF. An operator required to file financial assurance for a well pursuant to this section is considered to have met that requirement if the operator obtains a plugging insurance policy that includes the specific well and that:\n\n(1) is approved by the office of superintendent of insurance;\n\n(2) names the state of New Mexico as owner of the policy and contingent beneficiary;\n\n(3) names a primary beneficiary who agrees to plug the specified wellbore;\n\n(4) is fully prepaid and cannot be canceled or surrendered;\n\n(5) provides that the policy continues in effect until the specified wellbore has been plugged;\n\n(6) provides that benefits will be paid when, but not before, the specified wellbore has been plugged in accordance with rules of the oil conservation division in effect at the time of plugging; and\n\n(7) provides benefits that are not less than an amount equal to the one-well financial assurance required by oil conservation division rules.\n\nG. If, subsequent to an operator obtaining an insurance policy as provided in this section, the one-well financial assurance requirement applicable to the operator's well is increased, either because the well is deepened or the rules of the oil conservation division are amended, the operator is considered to have met the revised requirement if:\n\n(1) the existing policy benefit equals or exceeds the revised requirement;\n\n(2) the operator obtains an amendment increasing the policy benefit by the amount of the increase in the applicable financial assurance requirement; or\n\n(3) the operator obtains financial assurance equal to the amount, if any, by which the revised requirement exceeds the policy benefit.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 65-3-11.2, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 237, § 3; 1978, ch. 117, § 1; 1986, ch. 76, § 2; 2000, ch. 12, § 1; 2006, ch. 59, § 1; 2015, ch. 79, § 1; 2015, ch. 99, § 1; 2018, ch. 16, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For oil conservation division,see70-2-5 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor oil and gas reclamation fund,see70-2-37 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2018 amendment,effective May 16, 2018, increased the maximum amount of financial assurance the oil conservation division could require of oil and gas well operators; in Subsection A, after \"plugging financial assurance\", added \"which shall be set by rule\", and after \"not to exceed\", deleted \"fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), except for\" and added \"two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000)\".\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective April, 8, 2015, required operators to provide additional financial assurance for wells held in temporarily abandoned status, and provided that blanket plugging financial assurance for temporarily abandoned status wells shall be set by rule at amounts greater than fifty thousand dollars; in Subsection A, after \"(50,000)\", added \"except for a blanket plugging financial assurance for temporarily abandoned status wells, which shall be set by rule at amounts greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000)\", after \"deems relevant.\", deleted \"In addition to the blanket plugging financial assurance\", after \"oil conservation division\", changed \"may\" to \"shall\", and after \"more than two years\", added \"or, at the election of the operator, may allow an operator to increase its blanket plugging financial assurance to cover wells held in temporarily abandoned status\"; in Subsection F, Paragraph 1, after \"approved by the\", added \"office of superintendent of\", and after \"insurance\", deleted \"division of the public regulation commission\".\n\nLaws 2015, ch. 79, § 1 and Laws 2015, ch. 99, § 1 enacted identical amendments to this section, both effective April 8, 2015. The section was set out as amended by Laws 2015, ch. 99, § 1.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2006 amendment,effective May 17, 2006, provided in Subsection A that a well-specific plugging insurance policy may be furnished; added Subsection F to provide the criteria for an acceptable well-specific plugging insurance policy; and added Subsection G and Paragraphs (1) through (3) of Subsection G to provide the criteria for an acceptable well-specific plugging insurance policy or financial assurance if a one-well financial assurance requirement is increased.\n\nThe 2000 amendment,effective May 17, 2000, changed the section heading which formerly read \"Bonding requirement\"; inserted \"financial assurance in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit or\" in the first sentence in Subsection A; and substituted \"financial assurance\" for references to \"bonds\" and deleted \"and regulations\" following \"rules\" throughout the section.\n\nThe 1986 amendmentsubstituted \"cash or surety bond\" for \"surety bond\" in the first sentence and \"bonds\" for \"surety bonds\" in the second sentence of Subsection A; substituted \"oil conservation division\" for \"division\" in the first sentence of Subsection B; substituted \"bond\" for \"surety bond\" in the second sentence of Subsection B and near the beginning of the first sentence of Subsection E; inserted \"of the oil conservation division\" following \"director\" in Subsection C; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nAm.

      "text": "A. Whenever, to prevent waste, the total allowable production of crude petroleum oil for any field or pool in the state is fixed by the oil conservation division in an amount less than that which the field or pool could produce if no restriction were imposed, the division shall prorate or distribute the allowable production among the producers in the field or pool upon a reasonable basis and recognizing correlative rights.\n\nB. Crude petroleum oil produced within the allowable as fixed by the oil conservation division shall herein be referred to as \"legal oil\" and crude petroleum oil produced in excess of the allowable shall be \"illegal oil\".\n\nC. Whenever, to prevent waste, the total allowable natural gas production from gas wells producing from any pool in this state is fixed by the oil conservation division in an amount less than that which the pool could produce if no restrictions were imposed, the division shall allocate the allowable production among the gas wells in the pool delivering to a gas transportation facility upon a reasonable basis and recognizing correlative rights and shall include in the proration schedule of the pool any well which it finds is being unreasonably discriminated against through denial of access to a gas transportation facility which is reasonably capable of handling the type of gas produced by that well. In protecting correlative rights, the division may give equitable consideration to acreage, pressure, open flow, porosity, permeability, deliverability and quality of the gas and to such other pertinent factors as may from time to time exist and, insofar as is practicable, shall prevent drainage between producing tracts in a pool which is not equalized by counter-drainage. In allocating production pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the division shall fix proration periods of not less than six months. It shall, upon notice and hearing, determine reasonable market demand and make allocations of production during each proration period. Insofar as is feasible and practicable, gas wells having an allowable in a pool shall be regularly produced in proportion to their allowables in effect for the current proration period. Without approval of the division or one of its duly authorized agents, no natural gas well or pool shall be allowed to produce natural gas in excess of the allowable assigned to such source during any proration period; provided that during an emergency affecting a gas transportation facility, a gas well or pool having high deliverability into the facility under prevailing conditions may produce and deliver in excess of its allowable for the period of emergency, not exceeding ten days, without penalty. The division may order subsequent changes in allowables for wells and pools to make fair and reasonable adjustment for overage resulting from the emergency. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any wells or pools used for storage and withdrawal from storage of natural gas originally produced not in violation of the Oil and Gas Act [this article] or the rules, regulations or orders of the division.\n\nD. In fixing the allowable of a pool under Subsection C of this section, the oil conservation division shall consider nominations of purchasers but shall not be bound thereby and shall fix pool allowables to prevent unreasonable discrimination between pools served by the same gas transportation facility by a purchaser purchasing in more than one pool.\n\nE. Natural gas produced from gas wells within the allowable as determined as provided in Subsection C of this section shall be referred to in the Oil and Gas Act as \"legal gas\" and natural gas produced in excess of the allowable shall be referred to as \"illegal gas\".\n\nHistory:Laws 1935, ch. 72, § 12; 1941 Comp., § 69-213; Laws 1949, ch. 168, § 12; 1953 Comp., § 65-3-13; Laws 1977, ch. 255, § 50; 1985, ch. 6, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For duties of oil conservation division,see70-2-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nNew proration formula to be based on recoverable gas.— Lacking a finding that a new gas proration formula is based on amounts of recoverable gas in pool and under tracts, insofar as these amounts can be practically determined and obtained without waste, a supposedly valid order in current use cannot be replaced. Such findings are necessary requisites to validity of the order, for it is upon them that the very power of the commission to act depends.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nFindings required before correlative rights ascertained.— In order to protect correlative rights, it is incumbent upon commission to determine, \"so far as it is practical to do so,\" certain foundationary matters, without which correlative rights of various owners cannot be ascertained. Therefore, the commission, by \"basic conclusions of fact\" (or what might be termed \"findings\"), must determine, insofar as practicable: (1) amount of recoverable gas under each producer's tract; (2) total amount of recoverable gas in the pool; (3) proportion that (1) bears to (2); and (4) what portion of arrived at proportion can be recovered without waste. That extent of correlative rights must first be determined before commission can act to protect them is manifest.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nRelationship between prevention of waste and protection of correlative rights.— Prevention of waste is of paramount interest to legislature and protection of correlative rights is interrelated and inseparable from it. The very definition of \"correlative rights\" emphasizes term \"without waste.\" However, protection of correlative rights is necessary adjunct to prevention of waste.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nProduction must be limited to the allowableeven if market demand exceeds that amount, since the setting of allowables was made necessary in order to prevent waste.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nWhen Subsection C of this section and 70-2-19E NMSA 1978 are read together, one fact is evident: even after a pool is prorated, market demand must be determined, since, if allowable production from the pool exceeds market demand, waste would result if allowable is produced.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nCommission to prevent drainage between producing tracts.— In addition to making findings to protect correlative rights, commission, \"insofar as is practicable, shall prevent drainage between producing tracts in a pool which is not equalized by counter-drainage,\" under the provisions of Subsection C of this section.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nProperty rights of natural gas owners.— The legislature has stated definitively the elements contained in property right of natural gas owners. Such right is not absolute or unconditional. It consists of merely (1) an opportunity to produce, (2) only insofar as it is practicable to do so, (3) without waste, (4) a proportion, (5) insofar as it can be practically determined and obtained without waste, (6) of gas in the pool.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nKeeping of false records as actionable offense.— The Connally Hot Oil Act (15 U.S.C. § 715 et seq.) applies only to states which have in effect proration statutes for the purpose of preventing waste of oil and gas resources, encouraging conservation of oil and gas deposits, etc., and New Mexico is among those states which has enacted a valid comprehensive oil conservation law; since Connally Act applies to this state, keeping of false records, though not in violation of any New Mexico proration order, constitutes an actionable offense under Connally Act.Humble Oil & Ref.

      "text": "A. The rules, regulations or orders of the division shall, so far as it is practicable to do so, afford to the owner of each property in a pool the opportunity to produce his just and equitable share of the oil or gas, or both, in the pool, being an amount, so far as can be practically determined, and so far as such can be practicably obtained without waste, substantially in the proportion that the quantity of the recoverable oil or gas, or both, under such property bears to the total recoverable oil or gas, or both, in the pool, and for this purpose to use his just and equitable share of the reservoir energy.\n\nB. The division may establish a proration unit for each pool, such being the area that can be efficiently and economically drained and developed by one well, and in so doing the division shall consider the economic loss caused by the drilling of unnecessary wells, the protection of correlative rights, including those of royalty owners, the prevention of waste, the avoidance of the augmentation of risks arising from the drilling of an excessive number of wells, and the prevention of reduced recovery which might result from the drilling of too few wells.\n\nC. When two or more separately owned tracts of land are embraced within a spacing or proration unit, or where there are owners of royalty interests or undivided interests in oil and gas minerals which are separately owned or any combination thereof, embraced within such spacing or proration unit, the owner or owners thereof may validly pool their interests and develop their lands as a unit. Where, however, such owner or owners have not agreed to pool their interests, and where one such separate owner, or owners, who has the right to drill has drilled or proposes to drill a well on said unit to a common source of supply, the division, to avoid the drilling of unnecessary wells or to protect correlative rights, or to prevent waste, shall pool all or any part of such lands or interests or both in the spacing or proration unit as a unit.\n\nAll orders effecting such pooling shall be made after notice and hearing, and shall be upon such terms and conditions as are just and reasonable and will afford to the owner or owners of each tract or interest in the unit the opportunity to recover or receive without unnecessary expense his just and fair share of the oil or gas, or both. Each order shall describe the lands included in the unit designated thereby, identify the pool or pools to which it applies and designate an operator for the unit. All operations for the pooled oil or gas, or both, which are conducted on any portion of the unit shall be deemed for all purposes to have been conducted upon each tract within the unit by the owner or owners of such tract. For the purpose of determining the portions of production owned by the persons owning interests in the pooled oil or gas, or both, such production shall be allocated to the respective tracts within the unit in the proportion that the number of surface acres included within each tract bears to the number of surface acres included in the entire unit. The portion of the production allocated to the owner or owners of each tract or interest included in a well spacing or proration unit formed by a pooling order shall, when produced, be considered as if produced from the separately owned tract or interest by a well drilled thereon. Such pooling order of the division shall make definite provision as to any owner, or owners, who elects not to pay his proportionate share in advance for the prorata reimbursement solely out of production to the parties advancing the costs of the development and operation, which shall be limited to the actual expenditures required for such purpose not in excess of what are reasonable, but which shall include a reasonable charge for supervision and may include a charge for the risk involved in the drilling of such well, which charge for risk shall not exceed two hundred percent of the nonconsenting working interest owner's or owners' prorata share of the cost of drilling and completing the well.\n\nIn the event of any dispute relative to such costs, the division shall determine the proper costs after due notice to interested parties and a hearing thereon. The division is specifically authorized to provide that the owner or owners drilling, or paying for the drilling, or for the operation of a well for the benefit of all shall be entitled to all production from such well which would be received by the owner, or owners, for whose benefit the well was drilled or operated, after payment of royalty as provided in the lease, if any, applicable to each tract or interest, and obligations payable out of production, until the owner or owners drilling or operating the well or both have been paid the amount due under the terms of the pooling order or order settling such dispute. No part of the production or proceeds accruing to any owner or owners of a separate interest in such unit shall be applied toward the payment of any cost properly chargeable to any other interest in said unit.\n\nIf the interest of any owner or owners of any unleased mineral interest is pooled by virtue of this act, seven-eighths of such interest shall be considered as a working interest and one-eighth shall be considered a royalty interest, and he shall in all events be paid one-eighth of all production from the unit and creditable to his interest.\n\nD. Minimum allowable for some wells may be advisable from time to time, especially with respect to wells already drilled when this act takes effect, to the end that the production will repay reasonable lifting cost and thus prevent premature abandonment and resulting waste.\n\nE. Whenever it appears that the owners in any pool have agreed upon a plan for the spacing of wells, or upon a plan or method of distribution of any allowable fixed by the division for the pool, or upon any other plan for the development or operation of such pool, which plan, in the judgment of the division, has the effect of preventing waste as prohibited by this act and is fair to the royalty owners in such pool, then such plan shall be adopted by the division with respect to such pool; however, the division, upon hearing and after notice, may subsequently modify any such plan to the extent necessary to prevent waste as prohibited by this act.\n\nF. After the effective date of any rule, regulation or order fixing the allowable production, no person shall produce more than the allowable production applicable to him, his wells, leases or properties determined as in this act provided, and the allowable production shall be produced in accordance with the applicable rules, regulations or orders.\n\nHistory:Laws 1935, ch. 72, § 12; 1941 Comp., § 69-2131/2; Laws 1949, ch. 168, § 13; 1953, ch. 76, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 65-3-14; Laws 1961, ch. 65, § 1; 1973, ch. 250, § 1; 1977, ch. 255, § 51.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The term \"this act,\" referred to in this section, means Laws 1935, ch. 72, §§ 1 to 24, which appear as 70-2-2 to 70-2-4, 70-2-6 to 70-2-11, 70-2-15, 70-2-16, 70-2-21 to 70-2-25, 70-2-27 to 70-2-30, 70-2-33 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe terms \"spacing unit\" and \"proration unit\" are not synonymousand the commission has power to fix spacing units without first creating proration units.Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1975-NMSC-006, 87 N.M. 286, 532 P.2d 582.\n\nDetermination of recoverable gas.— The commission is not required, as a prerequisite to the entry of a valid proration order, to first determine the amount of gas underlying each producer's tract and in the pool, in a case in which the commission's findings demonstrate that such determinations are impracticable, and such findings are sustained by the record.Grace v. Oil Conservation Comm'n of N.M., 1975-NMSC-001, 87 N.M. 205, 531 P.2d 939.\n\nWhere the commission adopted a 100% surface acreage formula for allocating allowable production in a new pool that was not developed and had little production history; there having been sufficient production from the pool to accurately measure gas reserves using the pressure decline curve method; and data obtained at the well bore, such as effective feet of pay, water saturation, and deliverability were not sufficiently reliable to determine gas reserves under each tract, the commission was not required to determine the amount of gas underlying each tract as a prerequisite to entering of the proration order.Grace v. Oil Conservation Comm'n of N.M., 1975-NMSC-001, 87 N.M. 205, 531 P.2d 939.\n\nProration formula required to be based on recoverable gas.— Lacking a finding that new gas proration formula is based on amounts of recoverable gas in pool and under tracts, insofar as these amounts can be practically determined and obtained without waste, a supposedly valid order in current use cannot be replaced. Such findings are necessary requisites to validity of the order, for it is upon them that the very power of the commission to act depends.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nFindings required before correlative rights ascertained.— In order to protect correlative rights, it is incumbent upon commission to determine, \"so far as it is practical to do so,\" certain foundationary matters, without which the correlative rights of various owners cannot be ascertained. Therefore, the commission, by \"basic conclusions of fact\" (or what might be termed \"findings\"), must determine, insofar as practicable: (1) amount of recoverable gas under each producer's tract; (2) the total amount of recoverable gas in pool; (3) proportion that (1) bears to (2); and (4) what portion of arrived at proportion can be recovered without waste.

Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nIn addition to making such findings the commission, \"insofar as is practicable, shall prevent drainage between producing tracts in a pool which is not equalized by counter-drainage,\" under the provisions of 70-2-16 NMSA 1978.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nFour basic findings required to adopt a production formula under this section can be made in language equivalent to that required in previous decision construing this section.El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1966-NMSC-092, 76 N.M. 268, 414 P.2d 496 (explainingContinental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809).\n\nAlthough subservient to prevention of waste and perhaps to practicalities of the situation, protection of correlative rights must depend upon commission's (now division's) findings as to extent and limitations of the right. This the commission is required to do under the legislative mandate.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nDivision found not to have primary jurisdiction over suitseeking an order to join in an oil well free of risk penalty.Mountain States Natural Gas Corp. v. Petroleum Corp., 693 F.2d 1015 (10th Cir. 1982).\n\nGrant of forced pooling is determined on case-to-case basis.— The granting of or refusal to grant forced pooling of multiple zones with an election to participate in less than all zones, the amount of costs to be reimbursed to the operator, and the percentage risk charge to be assessed, if any, are determinations to be made by the commission (now the division) on a case-to-case basis and upon the particular facts in each case.Viking Petroleum, Inc. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1983-NMSC-091, 100 N.M. 451, 672 P.2d 280.\n\nForced pooling of multiple zones with an election to participatein less than all zones.Viking Petroleum, Inc. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1983-NMSC-091, 100 N.M. 451, 672 P.2d 280.\n\nDivision's findings upheld.— Commission's (now division's) findings that it would be unreasonable and contrary to the spirit of conservation statutes to drill unnecessary and economically wasteful well were held to be sufficient to justify creation of two nonstandard gas proration units, and the force pooling thereof, and were supported by substantial evidence. Likewise, participation formula adopted by commission, which gave each owner a share in production in same ratio as his acreage bore to acreage of the whole, was upheld despite limited proof as to extent and character of pool.Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1975-NMSC-006, 87 N.M. 286, 532 P.2d 582.\n\nRelation between prevention of waste and protection of correlative rights.— Prevention of waste is of paramount interest to the legislature and protection of correlative rights is interrelated and inseparable from it. The very definition of \"correlative rights\" emphasizes the term \"without waste.\" However, protection of correlative rights is necessary adjunct to the prevention of waste.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nDivision's authority to pool separately owned tracts.— Since commission (now division) has power to pool separately owned tracts within a spacing or proration unit, as well as concomitant authority to establish oversize nonstandard spacing units, commission also has authority to pool separately owned tracts within an oversize nonstandard spacing unit.Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1975-NMSC-006, 87 N.M. 286, 532 P.2d 582.\n\nElements of property right of natural gas owners.— The legislature has stated definitively the elements contained in property right of natural gas owners. Such right is not absolute or unconditional. It consists of merely (1) an opportunity to produce, (2) only insofar as it is practicable to do so, (3) without waste, (4) a proportion, (5) insofar as it can be practically determined and obtained without waste, (6) of gas in the pool.Continental Oil Co. v.

Whenever the operator of any oil or gas well shall dedicate lands comprising a standard spacing or proration unit to an oil or gas well, it shall be the obligation of the operator, if two or more separately owned tracts of land are embraced within the spacing or proration unit, or where there are owners of royalty interests or undivided interests in oil or gas minerals which are separately owned or any combination thereof, embraced within such spacing or proration unit, to obtain voluntary agreements pooling said lands or interests or an order of the division pooling said lands, which agreement or order shall be effective from the first production. Any division order that increases the size of a standard spacing or proration unit for a pool, or extends the boundaries of such a pool, shall require dedication of acreage to existing wells in the pool in accordance with the acreage dedication requirements for said pool, and all interests in the spacing or proration units that are dedicated to the affected wells shall share in production from the effective date of the said order.\n\nB. Any operator failing to obtain voluntary pooling agreements, or failing to apply for an order of the division pooling the lands dedicated to the spacing or proration unit as required by this section, shall nevertheless be liable to account to and pay each owner of minerals or leasehold interest, including owners of overriding royalty interests and other payments out of production, either the amount to which each interest would be entitled if pooling had occurred or the amount to which each interest is entitled in the absence of pooling, whichever is greater.\n\nC. Nonstandard spacing or proration units may be established by the division and all mineral and leasehold interests in any such nonstandard unit shall share in production from that unit from the date of the order establishing the said nonstandard unit.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 65-3-14.5, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 271, § 1; 1977, ch. 255, § 52.\n\nConstitutionality.— Standards of preventing waste and protecting correlative rights, as laid out in 70-2-11 NMSA 1978, are sufficient to allow commission's power to prorate and create standard or nonstandard spacing units to remain intact, and this section is not unlawful delegation of legislative power under N.M. Const., art. III, § 1.Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v.

      "text": "A. Every person now engaged or hereafter engaging in the business of purchasing oil to be transported through pipelines shall be a common purchaser thereof and shall, without discrimination in favor of one producer as against another in the same field, purchase all oil tendered to it which has been lawfully produced in the vicinity of, or which may be reasonably reached by pipelines through which it is transporting oil, or the gathering branches thereof, or which may be delivered to the pipeline or gathering branches thereof by truck or otherwise, and shall fully perform all the duties of a common purchaser. If any common purchaser shall not have need for all such oil lawfully produced within a field or if for any reason it shall be unable to purchase all such oil, then it shall purchase from each producer in a field ratably, taking and purchasing the same quantity of oil from each well to the extent that each well is capable of producing its ratable portions; provided, however, nothing herein contained shall be construed to require more than one pipeline connection for each producing well. In the event any such common purchaser of oil is likewise a producer or is affiliated with a producer, directly or indirectly, it is hereby expressly prohibited from discriminating in favor of its own production or in favor of the production of an affiliated producer as against that of others, and the oil produced by such common purchaser or by the affiliate of such common purchaser shall be treated as that of any other producer for the purposes of ratable taking.\n\nB. It shall be unlawful for any common purchaser to unjustly or unreasonably discriminate as to the relative quantities of oil purchased by it in the various fields of the state; the question of the justice or reasonableness to be determined by the division, taking into consideration the production and age of wells in the respective fields and all other factors. It is the intent of the Oil and Gas Act [this article] that all fields shall be allowed to produce and market a just and equitable share of the oil produced and marketed in the state, insofar as the same can be effected economically and without waste.\n\nC. It shall be the duty of the division to enforce the provisions of the Oil and Gas Act, and it shall have the power, after notice and hearing as provided in Section 70-2-23 NMSA 1978, to make rules, regulations and orders defining the distance that extension of the pipeline system shall be made to all wells not served; provided that no such authorization or order shall be made unless the division finds, as to such extension, that it is reasonably required and economically justified or, as to such extension of facilities, that the expenditures involved therein and the expense incident thereto are justified in relation to the volume of oil available for transportation through said extension; and such other rules, regulations and orders as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the Oil and Gas Act, and in making such rules, regulations and orders, the division shall give due consideration to the economic factors involved. The division shall have authority to relieve such common purchaser, after due notice and hearing as herein provided, from the duty of purchasing crude petroleum oil of inferior quality or grade or that is not reasonably suitable for the requirements of such common purchaser.\n\nD. Any person now or hereafter engaged in purchasing from one or more producers gas produced from gas wells or casing-head gas produced from oil wells shall be a common purchaser thereof within each common source of supply from which it purchases, and as such it shall purchase gas lawfully produced from gas wells or casing-head gas produced from oil wells with which its gas transportation facilities are connected in the pool and other gas lawfully produced within the pool and tendered to a point on its gas transportation facilities. Such purchases shall be made without unreasonable discrimination in favor of one producer against another in the price paid, the quantities purchased, the bases of measurement or the gas transportation facilities afforded for gas of like quantity, quality and pressure available from such wells. In the event any such person is likewise a producer, he is prohibited to the same extent from discriminating in favor of himself on production from gas wells or casing-head gas produced from oil wells in which he has an interest, direct or indirect, as against other production from gas wells or casing-head gas produced from oil wells in the same pool. For the purposes of the Oil and Gas Act, reasonable differences in prices paid or facilities afforded, or both, shall not constitute unreasonable discrimination if such differences bear a fair relationship to differences in quality, quantity or pressure of the gas available or to the relative lengths of time during which such gas will be available to the purchaser. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply:\n\n(1) to any wells or pools used for storage and withdrawal from storage of natural gas originally produced not in violation of the Oil and Gas Act or of the rules, regulations or orders of the division; or\n\n(2) to persons purchasing gas principally for use in the recovery or production of oil or gas.\n\nE. Any common purchaser taking gas produced from gas wells or casing-head gas produced from oil wells from a common source of supply shall take ratably under such rules, regulations and orders, concerning quantity, as may be promulgated by the division consistent with the Oil and Gas Act. The division, in promulgating such rules, regulations and orders, may consider the quality and the deliverability of the gas, the pressure of the gas at the point of delivery, acreage attributable to the well, market requirements in the case of unprorated pools, and other pertinent factors.\n\nF. Nothing in the Oil and Gas Act shall be construed or applied to require, directly or indirectly, any person to purchase gas of a quality or under a pressure or under any other condition by reason of which such gas cannot be economically and satisfactorily used by such purchaser by means of his gas transportation facilities then in service.\n\nHistory:Laws 1935, ch. 72, §§ 12a, 12b, and 12c, added by 1941, ch. 166, § 2; 1941 Comp., §§ 69-214, 69-215 and 69-216; Laws 1949, ch. 168, § 14; 1953 Comp., § 65-3-15; Laws 1977, ch. 255, § 53; 1983, ch. 94, § 1.\n\nRelationship between prevention of waste and correlative rights.— The prevention of waste is of paramount interest to the legislature and protection of correlative rights is interrelated and inseparable from it.

Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nAllowable not to exceed market demand.— When 70-2-16C NMSA 1978 and Subsection E of this section are read together, one fact is evident: even after a pool is prorated, the market demand must be determined, since, if allowable production from the pool exceeds market demand, waste would result if allowable is produced.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nBasis for change of allowables.— Enabling of gas purchasers to more nearly meet market demand is not an authorized statutory basis upon which change of allowables may be placed.Continental Oil Co. v.

In the event the rehearing is granted, the commission may enter a new order or decision after rehearing as may be required under the circumstances.\n\nB. A party of record to the rehearing proceeding dissatisfied with the disposition of the application for rehearing may appeal to the district court pursuant to the provisions of Section 39-3-1.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:Laws 1935, ch. 72, § 17; 1941 Comp., § 69-223; Laws 1949, ch. 168, § 19; 1953 Comp., § 65-3-22; Laws 1979, ch. 133, § 1; 1981, ch. 63, § 2; 1998, ch. 55, § 85; 1999, ch. 265, § 87.\n\nCross references.— For procedures governing administrative appeals to the district court,seeRule 1-074 NMRA.\n\nFor Rules of Appellate Procedure,seeRule 12-101 NMRA et seq.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, substituted \"Section 39-3-1.1\" for \"Section 12-8A-1\" in Subsection B.\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective September 1, 1998, rewrote this section.\n\nConstitutionality.— De novo judicial review of agency action or proration of gas production is not unlawful delegation of power in violation of the basic theory of separation of powers among legislative, executive and judicial branches of government.State ex rel. Oil Conservation Comm'n v. Brand, 1959-NMSC-038, 65 N.M. 384, 338 P.2d 113 (decided under prior law).\n\nSubsection A specifically requires filing of application for rehearingsetting forth the claimed invalidity of order entered by commission. Its purpose is to afford commission an opportunity to reconsider and correct erroneous decision.Pubco Petroleum Corp. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1965-NMSC-023, 75 N.M. 36, 399 P.2d 932.\n\nSubsection B relates solely to dissatisfied applicantand what he may do following entry of an order on rehearing or refusal of a rehearing. The term \"party of record to the rehearing proceeding,\" as used in Subsection B, means a party who has applied for a rehearing and is dissatisfied with disposition of his application.Pubco Petroleum Corp. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1965-NMSC-023, 75 N.M. 36, 399 P.2d 932.\n\nLack of jurisdiction.— Where plaintiff asked the Oil Conservation Commission to suspend proceeds from two gas wells in conjunction with plaintiff's objection to applications to pool mineral interests; the commission denied the request; plaintiff did not appeal the commission's decision; and plaintiff filed a motion in a quiet title action to suspend proceeds, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to rule on the motion.Edwin Smith, LLC v. Clark, 2011-NMCA-003, 149 N.M. 249, 247 P.3d 1134,rev'd,Edwin Smith, LLC v. Synergy Operating, LLC, 2012-NMSC-034, 285 P.3d 656.\n\nCommission's judicial decision preclusive.— Commission was acting in a judicial capacity when it approved a proposed unitization plan; its decision was therefore entitled to preclusive effect.Amoco Prod. Co. v. Heimann, 904 F.2d 1405 (10th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 942, 111 S. Ct. 350, 112 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1990).\n\nSupreme court review of commission's action.— The supreme court makes same review of commission's action as did district court. It is restricted to considering whether, as a matter of law, commission's action is consistent with and within scope of its statutory authority, and whether administrative orders are supported by substantial evidence.Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1975-NMSC-006, 87 N.M. 286, 532 P.2d 582.\n\nSufficiency of commission's findings.— Since appellant had filed two applications with the commission seeking either establishment of certain property within a gas pool as separate and distinct pool with special pool rules for production or, as an alternative, exemption of his wells from prorationing within gas pool and establishment of special production allowables, and at commission hearing appellant elicited evidence from his sole witness tending to support his applications, but commission did not put on any testimony, merely cross-examining appellant's witness, the record failing to provide any illumination as to why the testimony was wrong and should be disregarded, and nevertheless, commission found there was single common source of supply, that granting the applications would violate correlative rights and that their denial was necessary to prevent waste, it was held that administrative findings sufficiently extensive to show basis of commission's order was utterly lacking and reversal was thereby required.Fasken v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1975-NMSC-009, 87 N.M. 292, 532 P.2d 588.\n\nIn cases when sufficiency of the commission's findings is in issue or their substantial support is questioned, it must appear: (1) that commission made findings of ultimate facts which are material to the issues, having to do with such ultimate factors as whether a common source of supply exists, prevention of waste, protection of correlative rights and matters relative to net drainage, (2) that commission made sufficient findings to disclose reasoning of the commission in reaching its ultimate findings, and (3) findings must have substantial support in the record.Fasken v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1975-NMSC-009, 87 N.M. 292, 532 P.2d 588.\n\nQuestion whether commission's order instituting prorationing in a pool was arbitrary, unreasonable, unlawful and capricious because of lack of substantial evidence that wells were producing from same pool and because commission failed to determine amount of recoverable gas under each tract or in the pool was question of fact and not one of jurisdiction.Grace v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1975-NMSC-001, 87 N.M. 205, 531 P.2d 939.\n\nLack of jurisdiction.— Since corporation failed to exhaust its statutory administrative remedies, trial court was without jurisdiction to entertain review of the order of commission.Pubco Petroleum Corp. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1965-NMSC-023, 75 N.M. 36, 399 P.2d 932.\n\nCommission is necessary adverse party to an appealof one of its decisions and it was error for trial court to refuse to allow commission to participate as such.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\n\"Entry of an order\"means entering order upon a minute book or other proper book used to record the official acts of the commission. 1954 Op.

      "text": "As used in the Oil and Gas Act:\n\nA. \"person\" means:\n\n(1) any individual, estate, trust, receiver, cooperative association, club, corporation, company, firm, partnership, joint venture, syndicate or other entity; or\n\n(2) the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof or the state or any political subdivision thereof;\n\nB. \"pool\" means an underground reservoir containing a common accumulation of crude petroleum oil or natural gas or both. Each zone of a general structure, which zone is completely separate from any other zone in the structure, is covered by the word \"pool\" as used in the Oil and Gas Act. \"Pool\" is synonymous with \"common source of supply\" and with \"common reservoir\";\n\nC. \"field\" means the general area that is underlaid or appears to be underlaid by at least one pool and also includes the underground reservoir or reservoirs containing the crude petroleum oil or natural gas or both. The words \"field\" and \"pool\" mean the same thing when only one underground reservoir is involved; however, \"field\", unlike \"pool\", may relate to two or more pools;\n\nD. \"product\" means any commodity or thing made or manufactured from crude petroleum oil or natural gas and all derivatives of crude petroleum oil or natural gas, including refined crude oil, crude tops, topped crude, processed crude petroleum, residue from crude petroleum, cracking stock, uncracked fuel oil, treated crude oil, fuel oil, residuum, gas oil, naphtha, distillate, gasoline, kerosene, benzine, wash oil, waste oil, lubricating oil and blends or mixtures of crude petroleum oil or natural gas or any derivative thereof;\n\nE. \"owner\" means the person who has the right to drill into and to produce from any pool and to appropriate the production either for the person or for the person and another;\n\nF. \"producer\" means the owner of a well capable of producing oil or natural gas or both in paying quantities;\n\nG. \"gas transportation facility\" means a pipeline in operation serving gas wells for the transportation of natural gas or some other device or equipment in like operation whereby natural gas produced from gas wells connected therewith can be transported or used for consumption;\n\nH. \"correlative rights\" means the opportunity afforded, so far as it is practicable to do so, to the owner of each property in a pool to produce without waste the owner's just and equitable share of the oil or gas or both in the pool, being an amount, so far as can be practicably determined and so far as can be practicably obtained without waste, substantially in the proportion that the quantity of recoverable oil or gas or both under the property bears to the total recoverable oil or gas or both in the pool and, for such purpose, to use the owner's just and equitable share of the reservoir energy;\n\nI. \"potash\" means the naturally occurring bedded deposits of the salts of the element potassium;\n\nJ. \"casinghead gas\" means any gas or vapor or both indigenous to an oil stratum and produced from such stratum with oil, including any residue gas remaining after the processing of casinghead gas to remove its liquid components;\n\nK. \"produced water\" means a fluid that is an incidental byproduct from drilling for or the production of oil and gas;\n\nL. \"commission\" means the oil conservation commission; and\n\nM. \"division\" means the oil conservation division of the energy, minerals and natural resources department.\n\nHistory:Laws 1935, ch. 72, § 24; 1941 Comp., § 69-230; Laws 1949, ch. 168, § 26; 1953 Comp., § 65-3-29; Laws 1965, ch. 58, § 4; 1982, ch. 51, § 1; 1986, ch. 56, § 1; 2004, ch. 87, § 2; 2019, ch. 197, § 8.\n\nCross references.— For definition of \"waste,\"see70-2-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor definition of \"carbon dioxide gas,\"see70-2-34 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective July 1, 2019, defined \"commission\" and \"division\", and revised the definition of \"produced water\", as used in the Oil and Gas Act; in Subsection K, after \"means\", deleted \"water\" and added \"a fluid\"; and added Subsections L and M.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2019, ch. 197, § 12 provided that the provisions of Laws 2019, ch. 197 apply to contracts entered into on and after July 1, 2019.\n\nThe 2004 amendment,effective May 19, 2004, added Subsection K.\n\nThe 1986 amendment,effective May 21, 1986, added Subsection J and made stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nRelationship between prevention of waste and protection of correlative rights.— The prevention of waste is of paramount interest to the legislature and protection of correlative rights is interrelated and inseparable from it. The very definition of \"correlative rights\" emphasizes the term \"without waste.\" However, protection of correlative rights is a necessary adjunct to the prevention of waste.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nProtection of correlative rights.— Although subservient to prevention of waste and perhaps to the practicalities of the situation, protection of correlative rights must depend upon commission's findings as to extent and limitations of the right. This the commission is required to do under legislative mandate.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nRequired findings by commission to protect correlative rights.— In order to protect correlative rights, it is incumbent upon commission to determine, \"so far as it is practical to do so,\" certain foundationary matters, without which correlative rights of various owners cannot be ascertained. Therefore, the commission, by \"basic conclusions of fact\" (or what might be termed \"findings\"), must determine, insofar as practicable: (1) amount of recoverable gas under each producer's tract; (2) total amount of recoverable gas in the pool; (3) proportion that (1) bears to (2); and (4) what portion of the arrived at proportion can be recovered without waste. That extent of the correlative rights must first be determined before commission can act to protect them is manifest.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nCommission's findings upheld.— When commission exercises its duty to allow each interest owner in a pool his just and equitable share of the oil or gas underlying his property, mandate to determine the extent of those correlative rights is subject to the qualification as far as it is practicable to do so, and where commission established participation formula giving each owner in the unit a share in production in the same ratio as his acreage bore to the acreage of the whole units, the supreme court found that such a formula was reasonable and logical, if perhaps not the most complete or accurate method that may be used when more subsurface information becomes available.Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1975-NMSC-006, 87 N.M. 286, 532 P.2d 582.\n\nNew proration formula to be based on recoverable gas.— Lacking a finding that a new gas proration formula is based on the amounts of recoverable gas in the pool and under the tracts, insofar as these amounts can be practically determined and obtained without waste, a supposedly valid order in current use cannot be replaced. Such findings are necessary requisites to the validity of order, for it is upon them that the very power of commission to act depends.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nPrevention of drainage between producing tracts.— In addition to making findings to protect correlative rights, commission, \"insofar as is practicable, shall prevent drainage between producing tracts in a pool which is not equalized by counter-drainage,\" under the provisions of 70-2-16C NMSA 1978.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nElements of property rights of natural gas owners.— The legislature has stated definitively the elements contained in property right of natural gas owners. Such right is not absolute or unconditional. It consists of merely (1) an opportunity to produce, (2) only insofar as it is practicable to do so, (3) without waste, (4) a proportion, (5) insofar as it can be practically determined and obtained without waste, (6) of gas in the pool.Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 1962-NMSC-062, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment on Cont'l Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809 (1962), see 3 Nat. Res.
