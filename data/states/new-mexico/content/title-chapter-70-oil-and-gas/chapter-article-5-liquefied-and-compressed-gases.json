      "text": "As used in the LPG and CNG Act:\n\nA. \"liquefied petroleum gases\", \"LPG\" or \"LP gas\" means any material that is composed predominantly of any of the following hydrocarbons or mixtures of them: propane, propylene, butanes (normal butane or iso-butane) and butylenes;\n\nB. \"compressed natural gases\", \"CNG\", \"liquefied natural gases\" and \"LNG\" means mixtures of hydrocarbon gases, vapors or liquids consisting principally of methane that has been compressed for vehicular fuel;\n\nC. \"product\" or \"products\" of liquefied petroleum gases or compressed natural gases are considered to be liquefied petroleum gases or compressed natural gases, respectively;\n\nD. \"qualified instructor\" means an employee, owner or other qualified individual who has passed the required examination and performed for at least one year the work being taught;\n\nE. \"inspector\" means a person hired by the bureau to enforce under administrative direction the laws and safety rules and regulations of the bureau with respect to the LP gas industry and the use of CNG and LNG in motor vehicles;\n\nF. \"division\" means the construction industries division of the regulation and licensing department;\n\nG. \"bureau\" means the liquefied petroleum and compressed gas bureau of the division; and\n\nH. \"commission\" means the construction industries commission.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 71-804, enacted by Laws 1947, ch. 214, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 65-7-1; Laws 1955, ch. 97, § 1; 1973, ch. 362, § 1; 1977, ch. 245, § 124; 1989, ch. 6, § 50; 1993, ch. 186, § 1; 2017, ch. 57, § 1.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 2005, ch. 208, § 27, repealed 60-13-58 NMSA 1978, effective June 17, 2005, which would have repealed Chapter 70, Article 5 NMSA 1978 effective July 1, 2006.\n\nThe 2017 amendment,effective June 16, 2017, defined \"liquefied natural gases\" and \"LNG\", and revised the definitions of \"compressed natural gases\", \"qualified instructor\", and \"inspector\" as used in the LPG and CNG Act; in Subsection B, after \"gases'\", deleted \"and\", after \"'CNG'\", added \"'liquefied natural gases' and 'LNG'\", after \"hydrocarbon gases\", deleted \"and\", after \"vapors\", added \"or liquids\", and after \"methane\", deleted \"in gaseous form which\" and added \"that\"; in Subsection D, after \"an employee\", added \"owner or other qualified individual\"; and in Subsection E, after \"rules and regulations of the\", added \"bureau with respect to the\", and after \"CNG\", added \"and LNG\".\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, deleted \"Liquefied petroleum gas bureau\" preceding \"Definitions\" in the section heading; substituted \"means any material that is composed\" for \"means and includes any material which is composed\" in Subsection A; inserted Subsection B; redesignated former Subsections B through G as Subsections C through H; in Subsection C, inserted \"of liquefied petroleum gases or compressed natural gases\" following \"'products'\" and substituted the language beginning \"liquefied petroleum gases\" at the end of the subsection for \"LP gas\"; added \"and the use of CNG in motor vehicles\" at the end of Subsection E; and inserted \"and compressed\" in Subsection G.\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective July 1, 1989, in Subsection E, substituted \"regulation and licensing\" for \"commerce and industry\"; in Subsection F, substituted \"division\" for \"construction industries division of the commerce and industry department\"; and, in Subsection G, twice substituted \"commission\" for \"committee\".\n\nIntent of the legislaturewhen it passed this act was, because of inherent dangers involved in use or misuse, of liquefied petroleum gas and its appliances, that the state should have reasonable regulatory control to insure the health, safety and welfare of its citizens. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-08.\n\nJurisdiction of Mobile Housing Act and this act.— The Mobile Housing Act (now the Manufactured Housing Act), Chapter 60, Article 14 NMSA 1978, does not supersede or repeal by implication the Liquefied Petroleum Gas Act, with respect to jurisdiction over the installation of liquefied petroleum gas lines within a mobile housing unit. 1976 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 76-38.\n\nThe Mobile Housing Act (now the Manufactured Housing Act) in no way confers on mobile housing commission exclusive jurisdiction over liquefied petroleum gas line installations within mobile housing units. Both mobile housing commission (now mobile housing division) and the liquefied petroleum gas commission (now liquefied petroleum gas bureau) have jurisdiction to regulate and inspect the installation of liquefied petroleum gas lines in mobile homes. 1976 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 76-38.\n\nThere is no substantial difference between installation of heating equipment in a house trailer and installation of liquefied petroleum gas equipment in a permanent residence. The danger to the occupants is present in a house trailer, and if anything, is more pronounced therein than in a permanent domestic residence. Sections 70-5-1 to 70-5-22 NMSA 1978 were emergency acts passed by the legislature for protection of health and safety of people of New Mexico. The act intended to include all persons engaged in sale of liquefied petroleum appliances and installations thereof, regardless of manner in which those appliances were sold. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5627.\n\nPersons or firms selling house trailers equipped with liquefied petroleum appliances and piping are covered by the act and fully subject to all license fees and regulations promulgated by public service commission. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5627.\n\nLicensing requirement.— A retail seller of preassembled camping trailers in which liquefied petroleum gas appliances were installed is required to obtain a retail sales license from the liquefied petroleum gas commission (now liquefied petroleum gas bureau) if equipment installed is being fed from reservoir of more than five pounds of liquefied gas. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-08.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Gabaldon v. Sanchez: New Developments in the Law of Nuisance, Negligence and Trespass,\" see 9 N.M.L. Rev. 367 (1979).\n\nAm.

The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations as are necessary to carry out the purpose of the LPG and CNG Act [this article] and for the public peace, health and safety as affected by the use of such materials. The regulations made shall substantially conform with the standards as published by the national fire protection association covering the same subject matter. Nothing contained in this section is intended to alter the specifications for manufacturing or testing of containers established by the interstate commerce commission or the U.S. department of transportation or of containers installed in refineries, gas processing plants, underground storage terminals, natural gas distributing plants and pipeline terminals.\n\nB. The bureau may adopt a schedule of reasonable fees to be charged for furnishing any printed matter or forms, for filing or recording any data sheets, blueprints, drawings, plans, specifications, reports and any other instrument or document and for making and furnishing copies of any record, report, regulation, rule, law or any other matter on file with the bureau.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 71-807, enacted by Laws 1947, ch. 214, § 4; 1953 Comp., § 65-7-4; Laws 1957, ch. 221, § 1; 1973, ch. 362, § 5; 1977, ch. 245, § 127; 1989, ch. 6, § 53; 1993, ch. 186, § 5.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, inserted \"and CNG\" in the first sentence in Subsection A.\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective July 1, 1989, in Subsection A, substituted \"commission\" for \"committee\" in the first sentence and made several minor stylistic changes.\n\nRules and regulations apply to the public.— Where employees of a repair shop that specialized in the repair of utility equipment, including liquid propane delivery trucks, were severely injured when a propane tank they were repairing leaked liquid propane and exploded, the LPG and CNG Act imposed a duty on the employees to adhere to the Liquified Petroleum Gasses Handbook of the National Fire Protection Association, which had been adopted by the commission at the time of the accident.Apodaca v. AAA Gas Co., 2003-NMCA-085, 134 N.M. 77, 73 P.3d 215, cert. quashed, 2004-NMCERT-003, 135 N.M. 321.\n\nViolations of regulations adopted under this section held negligence per se.— Since this act was in full force and effect when an accident involving liquid gas occurred, regardless of its delayed repeal, violation of regulations for storage and handling of liquefied petroleum gas adopted under this section constituted negligence per se.Ray v. Aztec Well Serv. Co., 748 F.2d 888 (10th Cir. 1984).\n\nAuthority to charge reasonable fee.— Subsection B of this section gives liquefied petroleum gas commission (now liquefied petroleum gas bureau) authority to charge a reasonable fee for filing a form required of licensees for the purpose of indicating that any installation, testing or modification of liquefied gas containers, piping or appliance has been inspected. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-94.\n\nRequirements of insurance.— The commission (now liquefied petroleum gas bureau) would not be exceeding statutory authority to require one type of insurance, all types of insurance mentioned or combination thereof. Since commission (bureau) deals with an activity in which public safety factor is so important, it would appear that legislature has left to commission's discretion the evidence to be submitted of types of insurance carried by licensees under the act. 1955 Op.

No license shall be issued until the bureau has determined that the applicant meets all safety requirements provided for in that act and required by the rules and regulations of the commission and the bureau finds that the applicant is fit and able to perform the work for which a license is requested. Provided that household appliances and any other appliance, container or equipment being fed from a reservoir less than five pounds shall not be subject to the LPG and CNG Act. Provided, further, that retail sale of LP gas appliances, including factory installed LP gas appliances and equipment on campers, mobile homes and recreational vehicles, shall be exempt from this section.\n\nB.

Att'y Gen. No. 57-157.\n\nLegislature intended that all licensees were to file evidence of financial responsibility with the commission (now liquefied petroleum gas bureau) irrespective of whether they were old or new licensees. Therefore, there is no reason why licensees who have secured their license under the old act should not be required to immediately comply with the new act. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6260.\n\nSince the purpose of this section is to place close supervision over places where LP gas is handled, a corporation which with its principal office in Clovis, maintains an employee at Vaughn for purpose of distributing LP gas in Vaughn area from gas stored there, must obtain license for Vaughn office. 1949 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 49-5246.\n\nRegulation by public service commission.— Public service commission has authority to require licensees to inspect liquefied gas systems as a condition to their servicing and to require licensees to report unsafe conditions found to the end that such systems may be tagged and not used until made safe. 1951 Op.
