Such land and right-of-way shall be acquired in the manner provided by the Eminent Domain Code [42A-1-1 to 42A-1-33 NMSA 1978]. Pursuant to the requirements of Sections 42A-1-8 through 42A-1-12 NMSA 1978, the engineers, surveyors and other employees of such person, firm, association or corporation shall have the right to enter upon the lands and property of the state and of private persons and of private and public corporations for the purpose of making necessary surveys and examinations for selecting and locating suitable routes for such pipelines, microwave systems, structures and other necessary facilities, subject to responsibility for any damage done to such property in making surveys and examinations.\n\nB. The authorization provided for pursuant to Subsection A of this section for pipelines conveying petroleum, natural gas, carbon dioxide gas and products derived therefrom shall apply to trunk lines, including lines owned or operated by public utilities or interstate pipelines connecting a well or wells under a purchase or conveying contract, and shall not apply to gathering lines other than pipelines owned or operated by public utilities or their affiliates or interstate pipelines or to operators of pipelines whose rates are prescribed or whose operations are licensed by the state corporation commission [public regulation commission] pursuant to Section 70-3-1 or 70-3-2 NMSA 1978. For the purposes of this subsection, the term \"trunk line\" is defined as the main transmission line which transports petroleum, natural gas, carbon dioxide gas and the products derived therefrom from a producing area to the area where the petroleum, natural gas, carbon dioxide gas and the products derived therefrom are to be used. All other pipelines used in connection with such transportation of petroleum, natural gas, carbon dioxide gas and the products derived therefrom are defined as \"gathering lines\".\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 69-321, enacted by Laws 1953, ch. 42, § 8; 1953 Comp., § 65-4-8; Laws 1980, ch. 20, § 21; 1981, ch. 125, § 52; 1987, ch. 310, § 1; 1993, ch. 338, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler.
