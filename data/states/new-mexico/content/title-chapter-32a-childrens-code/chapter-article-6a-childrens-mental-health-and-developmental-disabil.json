A child in an out-of-home treatment or habilitation program shall have, in addition to other rights set forth in the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act, the right to:\n\n(1) be placed in a manner consistent with the least restrictive means principle;\n\n(2) have access to the state's designated protection and advocacy system and access to an attorney of the child's choice, provided that the child is not entitled to appointment of an attorney at public expense, except as otherwise provided in Subsection C of Section 32A-6A-13 NMSA 1978;\n\n(3) receive visitors of the child's own choosing on a daily basis, subject to restrictions imposed in the best interests of the child by the child's clinician for good cause. Hours during which visitors may be received shall be limited only in the interest of effective treatment and the reasonable efficiency of the program and shall be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the individual needs of the child and the child's visitors. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, each child has the right to receive visits from the child's attorney; physician; physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse or certified nurse-midwife working within that person's scope of practice; psychologist; clergy; guardian ad litem; or representatives from the state's protection and advocacy system or children, youth and families department in private at any reasonable time, irrespective of visiting hours, provided the visitor shows reasonable cause for visiting at times other than normal visiting hours;\n\n(4) have writing materials and postage stamps reasonably available for the child's use in writing letters and other communications.

In-person visitation is preferred, and reasonable efforts shall be made to facilitate such visitation unless the child and family choose otherwise. Access by legal custodians and family members to the child shall be limited only in the interest of effective treatment and the reasonable efficiency of the program and shall be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the individual needs of legal custodians and family members. Treatment needs that justify limitation on the access rights of a legal custodian or family member must be specifically documented by the clinician in the child's record, and any such limitation automatically expires in seven days;\n\n(6) follow or abstain from the practice of religion. The program shall provide appropriate assistance in this connection, including reasonable accommodations for religious worship and transportation to nearby religious services.

Each child shall receive a complete physical examination every twelve months thereafter;\n\n(11) a clean, safe and comfortable environment in a structure that complies with applicable fire and safety requirements;\n\n(12) appropriate medication and freedom from unnecessary or excessive medication. Medication shall not be used as discipline, as a substitute for programs, for the convenience of staff or in quantities that interfere with the child's treatment or habilitation program.

All prescriptions for psychotropic medications must be reviewed at least every thirty days. Notation of each child's medication shall be kept in the child's medical records and shall include a notation by the clinician licensed to prescribe medication of the behavioral or symptomatic baseline data upon which the medication order was made; and\n\n(13) a free public education. The child shall be educated in regular classes with nondisabled children whenever appropriate. In no event shall a child be allowed to remain in an out-of-home treatment or habilitation program for more than ten days without receiving educational services. If the child's placement in an out-of-home treatment or habilitation program is required by an individualized education plan that conforms to the requirements of state and federal law, the sending school is responsible for the provision of education to the child. In all other situations, the local school district in which the out-of-home treatment or habilitation program is located is responsible for the provision of educational services to the child. Nothing in this subsection shall limit a child's right to public education under state, tribal or federal law.\n\nB.

      "text": "A. When a child fourteen years of age or older has been determined according to the provisions of this section to lack capacity, the child's legal custodian may make a mental health or habilitation decision for the child unless the child objects to such decision or the legal custodian's assumption of authority to make mental health or developmental disability treatment decisions or determination of lack of capacity. Nothing in this subsection:\n\n(1) permits a legal custodian to consent to placement of a child in a residential treatment or habilitation program without the proper consent of the child if the child is fourteen years of age or older; or\n\n(2) in any way, limits a child's right to involuntary commitment procedures as set forth in the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act.\n\nB. The determination that a child fourteen years of age or older lacks or has recovered capacity shall be made by two clinicians, one of whom shall be a person who works with children in the ordinary course of that clinician's practice.\n\nC. A child fourteen years of age or older shall not be determined to lack capacity solely on the basis that the child chooses not to accept the treatment recommended by the mental health or developmental disabilities professional.\n\nD. A child fourteen years of age or older may at any time contest a determination that the child lacks capacity by a signed writing or by personally informing a clinician that the determination is contested. A clinician who is informed by a child that such determination is contested shall promptly communicate that the determination is contested to any supervising provider or institution at which the child is receiving care. Such a challenge shall prevail unless otherwise ordered by the court in a proceeding brought pursuant to the treatment guardianship provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act.\n\nE. A determination of lack of capacity under the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act shall not be evidence of incapacity for any other purpose.\n\nF. The legal custodian shall communicate an assumption of authority as promptly as practicable to the child fourteen years of age or older and to the clinician and to the supervising mental health or developmental disability treatment and habilitation provider.\n\nG. If more than one legal custodian assumes authority to act as an agent, the consent of both shall be required for nonemergency treatment. In an emergency, the consent of one legal custodian is sufficient, but the treating mental health professional shall provide the other legal custodian with oral notice followed by written documentation.\n\nH. If more than one legal custodian assumes authority to act as an agent and the legal custodians do not agree on a nonemergency mental health treatment decision and the clinician is so informed, the clinician shall not treat the child unless a treatment guardian is appointed pursuant to the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act.\n\nI. A legal custodian shall make treatment decisions in accordance with a child's individual instructions, if any, and other wishes to the extent known to the legal custodian. Otherwise, the legal custodian shall make decisions in accordance with the legal custodian's determination of the child's best interests. In determining the child's best interests, the legal custodian shall consider the child's personal values to the extent known to the legal custodian.\n\nJ. A mental health treatment decision made by a legal custodian for a child fourteen years of age or older who has been determined to lack capacity shall not be made solely on the basis of the child's pre-existing physical or medical condition or pre-existing or projected disability.\n\nK. A mental health treatment decision made by a legal custodian for a child fourteen years of age or older who has been determined to lack capacity is effective without judicial approval unless contested by the child.\n\nL.

In a treatment guardian proceeding, the court shall appoint an attorney for the child unless the child already has an attorney available.\n\nC. A petition shall be served on the child and the child's attorney. A hearing on the petition shall be held within three business days. At the hearing, the child shall be represented by counsel and shall have the right to be present, to present witnesses and to cross-examine opposing witnesses.\n\nD. If, after the hearing, the court finds that the child is not capable of making treatment decisions and treatment is needed, the court shall order the appointment of a treatment guardian. When appointing a treatment guardian, the court shall appoint the child's legal custodian unless the legal custodian is not readily available or the court finds that such an appointment is not in the child's best interests.\n\nE. The treatment guardian shall make a decision on behalf of the child based on the treatment guardian's best judgment of whether the treatment appears to be in the child's best interests and is consistent with the least restrictive means principle for accomplishing the treatment objective. In making this decision, the treatment guardian shall consult with the child and consider the child's expressed opinions. The treatment guardian shall give consideration to previous decisions made by the child in similar circumstances when the child was able to make treatment decisions and shall make the decision in accordance with the values of the child if known, or in the best interests of the child if the values are not known; provided that, if the child has given an individual instruction that is available to the treatment guardian, the instruction shall be followed.\n\nF. If a child who is not a resident of a residential treatment and habilitation program has a treatment guardian and refuses to comply with the decision of the treatment guardian, the treatment guardian may obtain an enforcement order. The enforcement order may authorize a peace officer to take the child into custody or to transport the child to an evaluation facility and may authorize the facility to forcibly administer treatment. The treatment guardian shall consult with the clinician who is proposing treatment, the child's attorney or guardian ad litem and, as deemed appropriate, interested friends or relatives of the child. The evaluation facility shall comply with the treatment guardian's decision unless the clinician finds it to be against the best interests of the child.\n\nG. A child, physician or other professional wishing to contest the decision of the treatment guardian may do so by filing a petition with the court within three calendar days or the next business day, whichever is later, of receiving notice of the treatment guardian's decision. The child shall be represented by counsel in all proceedings before the court. The court may overrule the treatment guardian's decision if it finds that decision to be against the best interests of the child. The court shall rule within seven days of the filing of the petition.\n\nH. If both a petition for an enforcement order and a petition to contest the treatment guardian's decision are filed, they shall be heard in the same proceeding at the same time.\n\nI. When the court appoints a treatment guardian, it shall specify the length of time during which the treatment guardian may exercise treatment guardian powers, up to a maximum period of one year. If, at the end of the guardianship period, the treatment guardian believes that the child still lacks capacity, the treatment guardian shall petition the court for reappointment or for appointment of a new treatment guardian. The guardianship shall be extended or a new guardian shall be appointed only if the court finds the child does not have capacity to make treatment or habilitation decisions at the time of the hearing. The court shall appoint an attorney for the child, and the child shall have the right to be present and to present evidence at all such hearings.\n\nJ. If, during the period of a treatment guardian's power, the treatment guardian, the child, the treatment provider or a member of the child's family believes that the child has regained capacity, that person may petition the court for a termination of the treatment guardianship. If the court finds the child has regained capacity, it shall terminate the power of the treatment guardian and restore to the child the power to make treatment decisions.\n\nK. A treatment guardian shall have only those powers enumerated in the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act.\n\nL. If a clinician licensed to prescribe medication believes that the administration of psychotropic medication is necessary to protect the child from serious harm that could occur while the provisions of this section are being satisfied, the licensed clinician may order or administer the medication on an emergency basis. When medication is administered to a child on an emergency basis, the clinician shall prepare and place in the child's medical records a report explaining the nature of the emergency and the reason that no treatment less restrictive than administration of psychotropic medication without proper consent would have protected the child from serious harm. When medication is administered to a child on an emergency basis, the child's legal custodian and the child's attorney or guardian ad litem shall be notified by the residential treatment or habilitation program. If the child is not in a residential setting, the clinician shall petition for a pickup order pursuant to Section 19 [32A-6A-19 NMSA 1978] of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act and have the child transported to a residential facility where the medication will be administered.\n\nHistory:Laws 2007, ch. 162, § 17.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2007, ch. 162 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M.

If the admitting physician or licensed psychologist determines that reasonable grounds do not exist to detain the child for evaluation and treatment, the child shall not be detained but shall be released to the custody of the child's legal custodian.\n\nF. Upon arrival at an evaluation facility, the child shall be informed orally and in writing by the evaluation facility of the purpose and possible consequences of the proceedings, the allegations in the petition, the child's right to a hearing within seven days, the child's right to counsel and the child's right to communicate with an attorney or a guardian ad litem and an independent mental health professional of the child's own choosing.

A child younger than fourteen years of age shall not receive residential treatment for a mental disorder or habilitation for a developmental disability, except as provided in this section.\n\nB. A child younger than fourteen years of age may be admitted to a residential treatment or habilitation program for a period not to exceed sixty days with the informed consent of the child's legal custodian, subject to the requirements of this section.\n\nC. In order to admit a child younger than fourteen years of age to a residential treatment or habilitation program, the child's legal custodian shall knowingly and voluntarily execute a consent to admission document prior to the child's admission. The consent to admission document shall be in a form designated by the supreme court. The consent to admission document shall include a clear statement of the legal custodian's right to consent voluntarily to or refuse the child's admission, the legal custodian's right to request the child's immediate discharge from the residential treatment program at any time and the legal custodian's rights when the legal custodian requests the child's discharge and the child's physician, licensed psychologist or the director of the residential treatment or habilitation program determines that the child needs continued treatment. The residential treatment or habilitation program shall ensure that each statement is clearly explained in the child's and legal custodian's primary language, if that is their language of preference, and in a manner appropriate to the child's and legal custodian's developmental abilities. Each statement shall be initialed by the child's legal custodian.\n\nD. The legal custodian's executed consent to admission document shall be filed with the child's treatment records within twenty-four hours of the time of admission.\n\nE. Upon the filing of the legal custodian's consent to admission document in the child's hospital records, the director of the residential treatment or habilitation program or the director's designee shall, on the next business day following the child's admission, notify the district court or the special commissioner appointed pursuant to Section 32A-6A-25 NMSA 1978 regarding the admission and provide the child's name, date of birth and the date and place of admission. The court or special commissioner shall, upon receipt of notice regarding a child's admission to a residential treatment or habilitation program, establish a sequestered court file.\n\nF. The director of a residential treatment or habilitation program or the director's designee shall, on the next business day following the child's admission, petition the court to appoint a guardian ad litem for the child. When the court receives the petition, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem.\n\nG. Within seven days of a child's admission to a residential treatment or habilitation program, a guardian ad litem, representing the child's best interests and in accordance with the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act [32A-6A-1 to 32A-6A-30 NMSA 1978], shall meet with the child, the child's legal custodian and the child's clinician. The guardian ad litem shall determine the following:\n\n(1) whether the child's legal custodian understands and consents to the child's admission to a residential treatment or habilitation program;\n\n(2) whether the admission is in the child's best interests; and\n\n(3) whether the admission is appropriate for the child and is consistent with the least restrictive means principle.\n\nH. If a guardian ad litem determines that the child's legal custodian understands and consents to the child's admission and that the admission is in the child's best interests, is appropriate for the child and is consistent with the least restrictive means principle, the guardian ad litem shall so certify on a form designated by the supreme court. The form, when completed by the guardian ad litem, shall be filed in the child's patient record kept by the residential treatment or habilitation program, and a copy shall be forwarded to the court or special commissioner within seven days of the child's admission. The guardian ad litem's statement shall not identify the child by name.\n\nI. Upon reaching the age of fourteen, a child who was admitted to a residential treatment or habilitation program pursuant to this section may petition the district court for the records of the district court regarding all matters pertinent to the child's admission to a residential treatment or habilitation program. The district court, upon receipt of the petition and upon a determination that the petitioner is in fact a child who was admitted to a residential treatment or habilitation program, shall provide all court records regarding the admission to the petitioner, including all copies in the court's possession, unless there is a showing that release of records would cause substantial harm to the child. Upon reaching the age of eighteen, a person who was admitted to a residential or treatment or habilitation program as a child may petition the district court for such records, and the district court shall provide all court records regarding the admission to the petitioner, including all copies in the court's possession.\n\nJ. A legal custodian who consents to admission of a child to a residential treatment or habilitation program has the right to request the child's immediate discharge from the residential treatment or habilitation program, subject to the provisions of this section. If a child's legal custodian informs the director, a physician or other member of the residential treatment or habilitation program staff that the legal custodian desires the child to be discharged from the program, the director, physician or other staff shall provide for the child's immediate discharge and remit the child to the legal custodian's care. The residential treatment or habilitation program shall also notify the child's guardian ad litem. A child whose legal custodian requests the child's immediate discharge shall be discharged, except when the director of the residential treatment or habilitation program, a physician or a licensed psychologist determines that the child requires continued treatment and that the child meets the criteria for involuntary residential treatment. In that event, the director, physician or licensed psychologist shall, on the first business day following the child's legal custodian's request for release of the child from the program, request that the children's court attorney initiate involuntary residential treatment proceedings. The children's court attorney may petition the court for such proceedings. The child has a right to a hearing regarding the child's continued treatment within seven days of the request for release.\n\nK. A residential treatment or habilitation program shall review the admission of a child at the end of a sixty-day period after the date of initial admission, and the child's physician or licensed psychologist shall review the admission to determine whether it is in the best interests of the child to continue the admission. If the child's physician or licensed psychologist concludes that continuation of the residential treatment or habilitation program is in the child's best interests, the child's clinician shall so state in a form to be filed in the child's patient records. The residential treatment or habilitation program shall notify the guardian ad litem for the child at least seven days prior to the date that the sixty-day period is to end or, if necessary, request a guardian ad litem pursuant to the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act. The guardian ad litem shall then personally meet with the child, the child's legal custodian and the child's clinician and ensure that the child's legal custodian understands and consents to the child's continued admission to the residential treatment or habilitation program. If the guardian ad litem determines that the child's legal custodian understands and consents to the child's continued admission to the residential treatment or habilitation program, that the continued admission is in the child's best interest, that the placement continues to be appropriate for the child and consistent with the least restrictive means principle and that the clinician has recommended the child's continued stay in the program, the guardian ad litem shall so certify on a form designated by the supreme court. The disposition of these forms shall be as set forth in this section, with one copy going in the child's patient record and the other being sent to the district court in a manner that preserves the child's anonymity. This procedure shall take place every sixty days following the child's last admission or a guardian ad litem's certification, whichever occurs first.\n\nL. When a guardian ad litem determines that the child's legal custodian does not understand or consent to the child's admission to a residential treatment or habilitation program, that the admission is not in the child's best interests, that the placement is inappropriate for the child or is inconsistent with the least restrictive means principle or that the child's clinician has not recommended a continued stay by the child in the residential treatment or habilitation program, the child shall be released or involuntary placement procedures shall be initiated.\n\nM. If the child's legal custodian is unavailable to take custody of the child and immediate discharge of the child would endanger the child, the residential treatment or habilitation program may detain the child until a safe and orderly discharge is possible. If the child's legal custodian refuses to take physical custody of the child, the residential treatment or habilitation program shall refer the case to the department for an abuse and neglect or family in need of court-ordered services investigation. The department may take the child into protective custody pursuant to the provisions of the Abuse and Neglect Act [Chapter 32A, Article 4 NMSA 1978] or the Family in Need of Court-Ordered Services Act [Chapter 32A, Article 3B NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:Laws 2007, ch. 162, § 20; 2008, ch. 75, § 5.\n\nCompiler's note.— The Family in Need of Court-Ordered Services Act cited in Subsection M, was repealed by Laws 2005, ch. 189, § 77.

A child fourteen years of age or older shall not receive treatment for mental disorders or habilitation for developmental disabilities on a voluntary residential basis, except as provided in this section.\n\nB. An admission of a child fourteen years of age or older to a residential treatment or habilitation program is voluntary when it is medically necessary and consented to by the child and the child's legal custodian as set forth in this section, provided that the admission does not exceed sixty days, subject to the requirements of this section.\n\nC. To have a child voluntarily admitted to a residential treatment or habilitation program, the child and the child's legal custodian shall knowingly and voluntarily execute, prior to admission, a child's voluntary consent to admission document. The document shall include a clear statement of the child's right to voluntarily consent or to request an immediate discharge from the residential treatment or habilitation program at any time; and the child's rights when the child requests a discharge and the child's physician, licensed psychologist or the director of the residential treatment or habilitation program determines the child needs continued treatment.

A child who is admitted on a voluntary basis has a right to an attorney. Prior to admission, the residential treatment or habilitation program shall inform the child's legal custodian of the child's right to an independent attorney within seventy-two hours. If the child's legal custodian is unable to obtain an independent attorney, the legal custodian may petition the court to appoint an attorney for the child. If the child's legal custodian obtains an independent attorney for the child, the legal custodian shall notify the residential treatment or habilitation program of that attorney's name within seventy-two hours of the child's voluntary admission.\n\nE. The child's executed voluntary consent to admission document shall be filed in the child's treatment record within twenty-four hours of the time of admission.\n\nF. Upon the filing of the child's voluntary consent to admission document in the child's treatment record, the director of the residential treatment or habilitation program or the director's designee shall, on the next business day following the child's admission, notify the district court or the special commissioner of the admission, giving the child's name, date of birth and the date and place of admission. Upon receipt of notice of a child's voluntary admission to a residential treatment or habilitation program, the court or special commissioner shall establish a sequestered court file.\n\nG. If within seventy-two hours of the child's voluntary admission the child has not met with an independent attorney and the child's legal custodian has not notified the residential treatment or habilitation program of the name of the child's independent attorney, the residential treatment or habilitation program shall during the next business day petition the court to appoint an attorney. When the court receives the petition, the court shall appoint an attorney.\n\nH. If within seventy-two hours of the child's voluntary admission the child has met with an independent attorney or the child's legal custodian has notified the residential treatment or habilitation program of the name of the child's independent attorney, the residential treatment or habilitation program shall during the next business day notify the court or the special commissioner of the name of the child's independent attorney.\n\nI. Within seven days of the admission, an attorney representing the child pursuant to the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act shall meet with the child. At the meeting with the child, the attorney shall explain to the child the following:\n\n(1) the child's right to an attorney;\n\n(2) the child's right to terminate the child's voluntary admission and the procedures to effect termination;\n\n(3) the effect of terminating the child's voluntary admission and options of the clinician and other interested parties to petition for an involuntary admission; and\n\n(4) the child's rights under the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act, including the right to:\n\n(a) legal representation;\n\n(b) a presumption of competence;\n\n(c) receive daily visitors of the child's choice;\n\n(d) receive and send uncensored mail;\n\n(e) have access to telephones;\n\n(f) follow or abstain from the practice of religion;\n\n(g) a humane and safe environment;\n\n(h) physical exercise and outdoor exercise;\n\n(i) a nourishing, well-balanced, varied and appetizing diet;\n\n(j) medical treatment;\n\n(k) educational services;\n\n(l) freedom from unnecessary or excessive medication;\n\n(m) individualized treatment and habilitation; and\n\n(n) participation in the development of the individualized treatment plan and access to that plan on request.\n\nJ. If the attorney determines that the child understands the child's rights and that the child voluntarily and knowingly desires to remain as a patient in a residential treatment or habilitation program, the attorney shall so certify on a form designated by the supreme court. The form, when completed by the attorney, shall be filed in the child's patient record at the residential treatment or habilitation program, and a copy shall be forwarded to the court or special commissioner within seven days of the child's admission. The attorney's statement shall not identify the child by name.\n\nK. Upon reaching the age of fourteen, a child who was a voluntary admittee to a residential treatment or habilitation program may petition the district court for the records of the court regarding all matters pertinent to the child's voluntary admission to a residential treatment or habilitation program. The court, upon receipt of the petition and upon a determination that the petitioner was in fact the child who was a voluntary admittee to a residential treatment or habilitation program, shall give all court records regarding the admission to the petitioner, including all copies in the court's possession unless there is a showing that provision of records would cause substantial harm to the child. A person who was admitted to a residential or treatment or habilitation program as a child, upon reaching the age of eighteen, may petition the district court for such records and the district court shall provide all court records regarding the admission to the petitioner, including all copies in the court's possession.\n\nL. Any child voluntarily admitted to a residential treatment or habilitation program has the right to an immediate discharge from the residential treatment or habilitation program upon the child's request, except as provided in this section.

The residential treatment or habilitation program shall not require that the child's request be in writing. Upon the request, the residential treatment or habilitation program shall notify the child's legal custodian to take custody of the child and remit the child to the legal custodian's care. The residential treatment or habilitation program shall also notify the child's attorney.

In that event, the director, physician or licensed psychologist, after making the determination, shall, on the first business day following the child's request for release from the voluntary program, request that the child's court attorney initiate involuntary placement proceedings. The child's court attorney may petition for such a placement. The child has a right to a hearing on the child's continued treatment within five days of the child's request for release.\n\nM. A child who is voluntarily admitted to a residential treatment or habilitation program shall have the child's voluntary admission reviewed at the end of a sixty-day period from the date of the child's initial admission to the program. The review shall be accomplished by having the child's physician or licensed psychologist review the child's treatment and determine whether it would be in the best interests of the child to continue the voluntary admission. If the child's physician or licensed psychologist concludes that continuation of treatment is in the child's best interests, the child's clinician shall so state in a form to be filed in the child's patient record. The residential treatment or habilitation program shall notify the child's attorney at least seven days prior to the date that the sixty-day period is to end or, if necessary, request an attorney pursuant to the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act. The attorney shall then personally meet with the child and ensure that the child understands the child's rights as set forth in this section, that the child understands the method for voluntary termination of the child's admission and that the child knowingly and voluntarily consents to the child's continued treatment.

A child afforded rights under the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act shall be advised of those rights at that child's first appearance before the court on a petition under that act.\n\nC. A child has the right to be placed in a residential treatment or habilitation program only when the placement is medically necessary.\n\nD. A person who believes that a child, as a result of a mental disorder or developmental disability, is in need of residential mental health or developmental disabilities services may request that a children's court attorney file a petition with the court for the child's involuntary placement. The petition shall include a detailed description of the symptoms or behaviors of the child that support the allegations in the petition, a list of prospective witnesses for involuntary placement and a summary of matters to which they will testify. The petition should also contain a discussion of the alternatives to residential care that have been considered and the reasons for rejecting the alternatives. A copy of the petition shall be served upon the child, the child's legal custodian and the child's attorney or guardian ad litem.\n\nE. The court shall, upon receiving the petition, appoint counsel for the child unless the child has retained an attorney or an attorney or guardian ad litem has been appointed pursuant to the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act. The attorney or guardian ad litem shall represent the child at all stages of the proceedings.\n\nF. If, after interviewing the child, the child's attorney or guardian ad litem determines that the child understands the child's rights and desires to waive the child's presence at the hearing on the issue of involuntary placement, the attorney or guardian ad litem shall submit a verified written statement to the court explaining the attorney's or guardian ad litem's understanding of the child's intent. If the court is satisfied that the child has voluntarily and knowingly waived the child's right to be present at the hearing, the child may be involuntarily placed in a residential treatment or habilitation program at a hearing at which the child is not present. By waiving the right to be present at the involuntary placement hearing, the child waives no other rights.\n\nG. An involuntary placement hearing shall be held within seven days of the emergency admission of the child to a residential treatment or habilitation program under this section. An involuntary placement hearing shall be held within five days from a child's declaration that the child desires to terminate the child's voluntary admission to a residential treatment or habilitation program if the child's clinician has assessed and documented that involuntary placement is necessary.\n\nH.

The court shall make an order involuntarily placing the child in a residential treatment or habilitation program upon a showing by clear and convincing evidence that:\n\n(1) as a result of mental disorder or developmental disability the child needs the treatment or habilitation services proposed;\n\n(2) as a result of mental disorder or developmental disability the child is likely to benefit from the treatment or habilitation services proposed;\n\n(3) the proposed involuntary placement is consistent with the treatment or habilitation needs of the child; and\n\n(4) the proposed involuntary placement is consistent with the least restrictive means principle.\n\nL. If the court determines that the child does not meet the criteria for involuntary placement set forth in this section, it may order the child to undergo nonresidential treatment or habilitation as may be appropriate and necessary or it may order no treatment. If the court determines that the child should not be involuntarily placed in a residential treatment or habilitation program and if the child's legal custodian refuses to take custody of the child, the court shall refer the case to the department for an abuse and neglect investigation. The department may take the child into custody pursuant to the provisions of the Abuse and Neglect Act [Chapter 32A, Article 4 NMSA 1978] or the Family in Need of Court-Ordered Services Act [Chapter 32A, Article 3B NMSA 1978].\n\nM.

      "text": "A. Except as otherwise provided in the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act, a person shall not, without the authorization of the child, disclose or transmit any confidential information from which a person well-acquainted with the child might recognize the child as the described person or any code, number or other means that could be used to match the child with confidential information regarding the child.\n\nB. When the child is under fourteen years of age, the child's legal custodian is authorized to consent to disclosure on behalf of the child. Information shall also be disclosed to a court-appointed guardian ad litem without consent of the child or the child's legal custodian.\n\nC. A child fourteen years of age or older with capacity to consent to disclosure of confidential information shall have the right to consent to disclosure of mental health and habilitation records. A legal custodian who is authorized to make health care decisions for a child has the same rights as the child to request, receive, examine, copy and consent to the disclosure of medical or other health care information when evidence exists that such a child whose consent to disclosure of confidential information is sought does not have capacity to give or withhold valid consent and does not have a treatment guardian appointed by a court. If the legal custodian is not authorized to make decisions for a child under the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act, the person seeking authorization shall petition the court for the appointment of a treatment guardian to make a decision for such a child.\n\nD. Authorization from the child or legal custodian shall not be required for the disclosure or transmission of confidential information when the disclosure or transmission:\n\n(1) is necessary for treatment of the child and is made in response to a request from a clinician;\n\n(2) is necessary to protect against a clear and substantial risk of imminent serious physical injury or death inflicted by the child on self or another;\n\n(3) is determined by a clinician not to cause substantial harm to the child and a summary of the child's assessment, treatment plan, progress, discharge plan and other information essential to the child's treatment is made to a child's legal custodian or guardian ad litem;\n\n(4) is to the primary caregiver of the child and the information disclosed was necessary for the continuity of the child's treatment in the judgment of the treating clinician who discloses the information;\n\n(5) is to an insurer contractually obligated to pay part or all of the expenses relating to the treatment of the child at the residential facility. The information disclosed shall be limited to data identifying the child, facility and treating or supervising physician and the dates and duration of the residential treatment. It shall not be a defense to an insurer's obligation to pay that the information relating to the residential treatment of the child, apart from information disclosed pursuant to this section, has not been disclosed to the insurer;\n\n(6) is to a protection and advocacy representative pursuant to the federal Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act and the federal Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act;\n\n(7) is pursuant to a court order issued for good cause shown after notice to the child and the child's legal custodian and opportunity to be heard is given. Before issuing an order requiring disclosure, the court shall find that:\n\n(a) other ways of obtaining the information are not available or would not be effective; and\n\n(b) the need for the disclosure outweighs the potential injury to the child, the clinician-child relationship and treatment services; or\n\n(8) is, for all confidential information in existence on and after July 1, 2024, to a governmental agency, its agent or a state educational institution, a duly organized state or county association of licensed physicians or dentists or a licensed health facility or staff committees of such a facility for the purpose of research, subject to the provisions of Section 14-6-1 NMSA 1978 and subject to the review of an institutional review board in compliance with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or any succeeding legislation and any federal regulations governing institutional review boards.\n\nE. A disclosure ordered by the court shall be limited to the information that is essential to carry out the purpose of the disclosure. Disclosure shall be limited to those persons whose need for the information forms the basis for the order. An order by the court shall include such other measures as are necessary to limit disclosure for the protection of the child, including sealing from public scrutiny the record of a proceeding for which disclosure of a child's record has been ordered.\n\nF. An authorization given for the transmission or disclosure of confidential information shall not be effective unless it:\n\n(1) is in writing and signed; and\n\n(2) contains a statement of the child's right to examine and copy the information to be disclosed, the name or title of the proposed recipient of the information and a description of the use that may be made of the information.\n\nG. The child has a right of access to confidential information about the child and has the right to make copies of information about the child and submit clarifying or correcting statements and other documentation of reasonable length for inclusion with the confidential information. The statements and other documentation shall be kept with the relevant confidential information, shall accompany it in the event of disclosure and shall be governed by the provisions of this section to the extent the statements or other documentation contain confidential information. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the denial of access to the records when a physician or other mental health or developmental disabilities professional believes and notes in the child's medical records that the disclosure would not be in the best interests of the child. In all cases, the child has the right to petition the court for an order granting access.\n\nH. Information concerning a child disclosed under this section shall not be released to any other person, agency or governmental entity or placed in files or computerized data banks accessible to any persons not otherwise authorized to obtain information under this section. Notwithstanding the confidentiality provisions of the Delinquency Act [Chapter 32A, Article 2 NMSA 1978] and the Abuse and Neglect Act Chapter [32A, Article 4 NMSA 1978], information disclosed under this section shall not be re-released without the express consent of the child or legal custodian authorized under the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act to give consent and any other consent necessary for redisclosure in conformance with state and federal law, including consent that may be required from the professional or the facility that created the document.\n\nI. Nothing in the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act shall limit the confidentiality rights afforded by federal statute or regulation.\n\nJ.
