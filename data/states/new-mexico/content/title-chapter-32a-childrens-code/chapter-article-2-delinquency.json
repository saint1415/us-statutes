      "heading": "Purpose of act.",
      "text": "The purpose of the Delinquency Act is:\n\nA. consistent with the protection of the public interest, to remove from children committing delinquent acts the adult consequences of criminal behavior, but to still hold children committing delinquent acts accountable for their actions to the extent of the child's age, education, mental and physical condition, background and all other relevant factors, and to provide a program of supervision, care and rehabilitation, including rehabilitative restitution by the child to the victims of the child's delinquent act to the extent that the child is reasonably able to do so;\n\nB. to provide effective deterrents to acts of juvenile delinquency, including an emphasis on community-based alternatives;\n\nC. to strengthen families and to successfully reintegrate children into homes and communities;\n\nD. to foster and encourage collaboration between government agencies and communities with regard to juvenile justice policies and procedures;\n\nE. to develop juvenile justice policies and procedures that are supported by data;\n\nF. to develop objective risk assessment instruments to be used for admission to juvenile detention centers;\n\nG. to encourage efficient processing of cases;\n\nH. to develop community-based alternatives to detention;\n\nI. to eliminate or reduce disparities based upon race or gender;\n\nJ. to improve conditions of confinement in juvenile detention centers; and\n\nK. to achieve reductions in the number of warrants issued, the number of probation violations and the number of youth awaiting placements.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-2, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 31; 2003, ch. 225, § 2; 2007, ch. 19, § 2.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, added Subsections D through K.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, added Subsection C.\n\nRules governing applicable proceedings.— Reading the Children's Code and the Children's Court Rules together, the overall scheme contemplates that, while the Rules of Criminal Procedure govern the adjudicatory proceedings in youthful offender cases, the Children's Court Rules govern all dispositional proceedings for all youthful offenders.State v. Stephen F., 2005-NMCA-048, 137 N.M. 409, 112 P.3d 270,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2006 NMSC-030, 140 N.M. 24, 139 P.3d 184.\n\nApplication of section eliminated.— The express language \"notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary\" in the first sentence of Section 32A-2-14F NMSA 1978 is construed to eliminate the application of this section to show legislative intent to balance accountability with protection of children.State v. Jade G., 2005-NMCA-019, 137 N.M. 128, 108 P.3d 534,aff'd, 2007-NMSC-010, 141 N.M. 284, 154 P.3d 659.\n\nMeeting section goals.— Where child's interim detention served the specific purposes of holding child accountable, providing supervision, ensuring for his health and physical safety, providing a deterrent and acting in a manner consistent with the public interest, it was an attempt to meet the goals set forth in this section as part of an overall disposition effort.State v. Wacey C., 2004-NMCA-029, 135 N.M. 186, 86 P.3d 611.\n\nPresentence credit.— A child who is found not guilty of being a serious youthful offender, but adjudicated as a delinquent offender on a lesser-included offense, is not entitled to presentence confinement credit against the child's commitment to the children, youth and families department.State v. Nanco, 2012-NMCA-109, 288 P.3d 527, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-010.\n\nWhere the child, who was fifteen years old, was charged with committing first degree murder and two counts of tampering with evidence, and the jury determined that the child had committed the delinquent acts of voluntary manslaughter and one count with tampering with evidence, the child was not entitled to presentence confinement credit against the child's commitment to the custody of the children, youth and families department for the twenty-five months the child was detained in a juvenile detention facility before the district court adjudicated the child a delinquent offender.State v. Nanco, 2012-NMCA-109, 288 P.3d 527, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-010.\n\nLaw enforcement does not have a duty to consider a child's mental disability before arresting the child, if the arresting officer has established probable cause to arrest.— Where a law enforcement officer has established probable cause to arrest a child for committing a delinquent act, the Delinquency Act does not impose an additional duty on the law enforcement officer to investigate whether a disability prevents the child from forming the requisite intent to commit the delinquent act.J.H. ex rel. J.P. v. Bernalillo Cnty., 61 F.Supp.3d 1085 (D.N.M. 2014).\n\nWhere student resource officer had probable cause to arrest plaintiff, a sixth grade student who had been qualified as emotionally disturbed, based on the officer's own observation of plaintiff kicking her teacher, corroborated by interviews with the teacher and another student who had been attacked by plaintiff, the officer did not violate the plaintiff's fourth amendment rights when he arrested plaintiff, and the New Mexico Delinquency Act did not impose a duty on the officer to investigate whether plaintiff's disability prevented her from forming the requisite intent to commit battery on a school employee; once probable cause to arrest is established, an officer is not required to continue to investigate for exculpatory evidence before arresting a suspect.J.H. ex rel. J.P. v. Bernalillo Cnty., 61 F.Supp.3d 1085 (D.N.M. 2014).",

The felony adjudications relied upon as prior adjudications shall not have arisen out of the same transaction or occurrence or series of events related in time and location. Successful completion of consent decrees is not considered a prior adjudication for the purposes of this paragraph; or\n\n(3) fourteen years of age and who is adjudicated for first degree murder, as provided in Section 30-2-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-3, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 32; 1995, ch. 204, § 2; 1995, ch. 205, § 2; 1995, ch. 206, § 10; 1996, ch. 85, § 2; 2003, ch. 225, § 3; 2005, ch. 189, § 11; 2009, ch. 239, § 10; 2019, ch. 101, § 1; 2024, ch. 38, § 17.\n\nThe 2024 amendment,effective July 1, 2024, added \"trafficking cannabis products\" to the list of offenses under the Delinquency Act; and in Subsection A, added Paragraph A(8).\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective June 14, 2019, excluded prostitution from the definition of \"delinquent act\" as used in the Delinquency Act; and in Subsection A, added \"not including a violation of Section 30-9-2 NMSA 1978\".\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Paragraph (1) of Subsection A, at the beginning of the sentence, deleted \"an offense\" and added \"any of the following offenses\"; and added Subsection I\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, deleted former Subsection A(3), which provided that a delinquent act included a felony violations of Section 17-1-1 through 17-5-9 NMSA 1978 and regulations adopted by the state game commission; and defined \"youthful offender\" in Subsection I to include a delinquent child fourteen to eighteen years of age and who is adjudicated for aggravated battery against a household member.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, added \"an offense\" at the beginning of Paragraph A(1); deleted \"any\" at the beginning of Subparagraphs A(1)(a) to (h); in Paragraph A(2), substituted \"an establishment\" for \"establishments\" preceding \"as defined in\", substituted \"serves\" for \"serve\" following \"public safety, that\"; added Paragraph A(8); and substituted \"a\" for \"any\" or \"an\" for \"any\" throughout the section.\n\nThe 1996 amendment,effective July 1, 1996, deleted \"but not limited to\" in the introductory language of Subsection A and added Paragraph A(7); substituted \"fifteen to eighteen\" \"for sixteen or seventeen\" in Subsection H; substituted \"fourteen\" for \"fifteen\" at the beginning of Paragraphs I(1), (2) and (3); added Subparagraph I(1)(e) and redesignated the following subparagraphs accordingly; deleted \"which results in great bodily harm to another person\" preceding \"was provided\" in Subparagraph I(1)(f); added Subparagraph I(1)(l); and made stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, inserted \"felony\" preceding \"violation\" in Paragraph (3) of Subsection A; substituted \"32A-2-27\" for \"32-2-27\" in Subsection G; substituted \"three-year\" for \"two-year\" preceding \"time period\" in Paragraph (2) of Subsection I; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section. Laws 1995, ch. 204, § 2 and Laws 1995, ch. 205, § 2 also amended this section. The section was set out as amended by Laws 1995, ch. 206, § 10.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-3 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nLaw enforcement does not have a duty to consider a child's mental disability before arresting the child, if the arresting officer has established probable cause to arrest.— Where a law enforcement officer has established probable cause to arrest a child for committing a delinquent act, the Delinquency Act does not impose an additional duty on the law enforcement officer to investigate whether a disability prevents the child from forming the requisite intent to commit a delinquent act.J.H. ex rel. J.P. v. Bernalillo Cnty., 61 F.Supp.3d 1085 (D.N.M. 2014).\n\nWhere student resource officer had probable cause to arrest plaintiff, a sixth grade student who had been qualified as emotionally disturbed, based on the officer's own observation of plaintiff kicking her teacher, corroborated by interviews with the teacher and another student who had been attacked by plaintiff, the officer did not violate the plaintiff's fourth amendment rights when he arrested plaintiff, and the New Mexico Delinquency Act did not impose a duty on the officer to investigate whether plaintiff's disability prevented her from forming the requisite intent to commit battery on a school employee; once probable cause is established, an officer is not required to continue to investigate for exculpatory evidence before arresting a suspect.J.H. ex rel. J.P. v. Bernalillo Cnty., 61 F.Supp.3d 1085 (D.N.M. 2014).\n\nCommitment to age 21.— Section 32A-2-19 B(1)(c) NMSA 1978 does not say that commitment to age 21 is authorized only for children who fit the definition of youthful offenders as set forth in Subsection I (now J) of this section.State v. Indie C., 2006-NMCA-014, 139 N.M. 80, 128 P.3d 508, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-001, 139 N.M. 273, 131 P.3d 660.\n\nDelinquency Act does not define or describe \"complaint\".State v. Jade G., 2005-NMCA-019, 137 N.M. 128, 108 P.3d 534, aff'd, 2007-NMSC-010, 141 N.M. 284, 154 P.3d 659.\n\nLegislature intended to create three categories of juvenile offenders subject to varying degrees of accountability.State v. Stephen F., 2005-NMCA-048, 137 N.M. 409, 112 P.3d 270,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2006-NMSC-030, 140 N.M. 24, 139 P.3d 184.\n\nConstitutionality of excluding serious youthful offenders convicted of first-degree felony murder from receiving an amenability hearing.— Where defendant was charged and convicted of three counts of first-degree felony murder and conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary, based on evidence that defendant, who was sixteen years old at the time, killed three members of a family with a pickaxe after he and two co-conspirators planned to burglarize the family in order to get money, and where, prior to sentencing, defendant filed a motion arguing that the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and the constitutional guarantee of equal protection require an amendability hearing in conjunction with the court's sentencing, defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by being sentenced without an amenability hearing, because cruel and unusual punishment jurisprudence does not guarantee an amenability hearing to juveniles simply because they are juveniles, and defendant failed to show that the legislature's statutory distinction is unsupported by a firm rationale or evidence in the record.State v. Ortiz, 2021-NMSC-029.\n\n\"Serious youthful offender\".— This section clearly expresses a legislative intent to treat those children charged with first degree murder differently than other children, even if ultimately those children are not found guilty on the first degree murder charge.State v. Muniz, 2003-NMSC-021, 134 N.M. 152, 74 P.3d 86.\n\nIntent of the legislature.— The legislature intended to treat children charged with first degree murder as adults, not as delinquent children.State v. Muniz, 2003-NMSC-021, 134 N.M. 152, 74 P.3d 86.\n\nThe right to be treated as a child is a statutory, not a constitutional, right. Therefore, it is within the purview of the legislature to decide that children initially accused of first degree murder, even if found not guilty of that charge, may be sentenced as adults for other crimes.State v. Muniz, 2003-NMSC-021, 134 N.M. 152, 74 P.3d 86, superseded by statute, State v. Jones, 2010-NMSC-012, 148 N.M. 1, 229 P.3d 474.\n\nConviction of crime necessary prerequisite to determination of delinquency.— It is a fundamental right of a party to be convicted of a crime, which is a necessary prerequisite to a determination of delinquency, based upon evidence of the elements of the crime, and in a prosecution for a violation of Section 30-31-23 NMSA 1978, the state must prove that the respondents had knowledge of the presence and character of the item possessed; a degree of furtiveness on the parts of juvenile respondents, in doing their smoking and passing a pipe around between buildings while changing classes, in light of a school regulation prohibiting the smoking of tobacco, was not conduct sufficient to imply that the smokers knew the character of the substance they were using.Doe v. State, 1975-NMCA-108, 88 N.M. 347, 540 P.2d 827, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nCurfew ordinance not within definition.— A village curfew ordinance forbidding any juvenile under the age of 18 years to be upon the streets between certain hours unless accompanied by a parent or guardian does not come within the purview of the definition of a delinquent act since the ordinance relates only to juveniles under the age of 18 years.In re Doe, 1975-NMCA-048, 87 N.M. 466, 535 P.2d 1092,rev'd on other groundssub nom. State v. Doe, 1975-NMSC-034, 88 N.M. 137, 537 P.2d 1399.\n\nSentencing as adult for unlisted crime.— A juvenile who is adjudicated for any of the offenses listed under Subsection I (now J) of this section may be subject to adult sanctions under Section 32A-2-20 NMSA 1978 for any other offense in the same case.State v. Montano, 1995-NMCA-065, 120 N.M. 218, 900 P.2d 967, cert. denied, 120 N.M. 68, 898 P.2d 120.\n\nProsecution as youthful offender for misdemeanor aggravated battery.— There is no incongruity or injustice in the legislature's decision to include misdemeanor aggravated battery in the list of offenses in Subsection I, or to exclude manslaughter and certain sexual assaults therefrom; therefore, prosecution of a juvenile as a youthful offender for misdemeanor aggravated battery was proper.State v. Michael S., 1995-NMCA-112, 120 N.M. 617, 904 P.2d 595 (decided under prior law).\n\nAllegation of delinquency sufficient.— Petition was not jurisdictionally defective for failure to allege that defendant was in need of care or rehabilitation since it alleged defendant was a delinquent child, which was defined to mean a child who has committed a delinquent act and is in need of care or rehabilitation.Doe v. State, 1976-NMCA-002, 88 N.M. 627, 545 P.2d 93 (decided under prior law).\n\nProbation order void without finding of need of care.— The children's court order which placed a child on probation without a finding that the child was in need of care or rehabilitation was unauthorized and void; probation is authorized for a child found to be delinquent, and a child is not delinquent unless in need of care or rehabilitation.State v. Doe, 1977-NMCA-023, 90 N.M. 249, 561 P.2d 948 (decided under prior law).\n\nIf no finding of delinquency, then no diagnostic evaluation.— Although a child was found to have committed delinquent acts, there was no finding that the child was in need of care or rehabilitation, or a finding that the child was a delinquent child, and thus the children's court lacked authority to order a diagnostic evaluation.State v. Doe, 1977-NMCA-023, 90 N.M. 249, 561 P.2d 948 (decided under prior law).\n\nDelinquent child allegation improper where charge for possession of liquor.— The act of possession of alcoholic beverages with which a 16-year-old child was charged could be characterized as a delinquent act and the allegation of delinquent child seemed proper, since an adult between the ages of 18 and 21 may under certain circumstances be guilty of a crime when in possession of alcoholic beverages. However, it cannot apply to any minor under the age of 18 under the Children's Code since the children's court has exclusive jurisdiction of any illegal act committed by a child under the age of 18 and it is not considered a crime, unless there is a specific exception made in the Code itself.State v. Doe, 1975-NMSC-034, 88 N.M. 137, 537 P.2d 1399 (decided under prior law).\n\nProbable cause of possession of alcohol.— Probable cause to believe that a child wrongfully possessed or consumed alcohol sufficient to justify an arrest and warrantless search was not shown by the fact that the child's friend smelled of alcohol, or by the child's admission that he consumed a beer outside of the officer's presence.State v. Tywayne, 1997-NMCA-015, 123 N.M. 42, 933 P.2d 251, cert. denied, 123 N.M. 83, 934 P.2d 277.\n\nMagistrate and municipal court jurisdiction.— It appears that municipal and magistrate courts can exercise jurisdiction over children for traffic offenses which are not designated delinquent acts under the Children's Code. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-34.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"State v. Muniz: Authorizing Adult Sentences of Juveniles Absent a Conviction that Authorizes an Adult Sentence\", see 35 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. The department shall promulgate updated standards for all detention facilities, including standards for site, design, construction, equipment, care, program, personnel and clinical services. The department shall certify as approved all detention facilities in the state meeting the standards promulgated. The department may establish by rule appropriate procedures for provisional certification and the waiving of any of its standards for facilities in existence at the time of the adoption of the standards, except that it shall not allow waiver of any standard pertaining to adequate health and safety protection of the residents and staff of the facility. No child shall be detained in a detention facility unless it is certified as approved by the department, except as otherwise provided in Chapter 32A, Article 2 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. The department shall inspect all detention facilities in the state at least once each twelve months and shall require those reports it deems necessary from detention facilities in a form and containing the information determined by the department. If as the result of an inspection a certified detention facility is determined as failing to meet the required standards, its certification is subject to revocation or refusal for renewal by the department.\n\nC. The department shall promulgate rules establishing procedures that provide for prior notice and public hearings on detention facilities' standards adoption and changes. The department shall also promulgate rules establishing procedures for facility certification, renewal of certification, refusal to renew certification and revocation of certification. The procedures adopted on these matters shall provide for adequate prior notice of intended action by the department, opportunity for the aggrieved person to have an administrative hearing and written notification of the administrative decision.

Any person aggrieved by an administrative decision of the department rendered under the provisions of this section may petition for the review of the administrative decision by appealing to the district court pursuant to the provisions of Section 39-3-1.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nE. After January 1, 1994, no state or county detention facility shall hold juveniles sentenced by a federal court, unless the facility meets state standards promulgated by the department.\n\nF. A juvenile detention facility certified by the department shall comply with the daily reporting requirement for children in detention, including reports on the length of stay for each child. This information shall be reported as required by the department.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-4, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 33; 1998, ch. 55, § 42; 1999, ch. 265, § 44; 2009, ch. 239, § 11.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, added Subsection F.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, substituted \"Section 39-3-1.1\" for \"Section 12-8A-1\" in Subsection D.\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective September 1, 1998, in the section heading, inserted \"; appeals\"; in Subsection A, substituted \"Chapter 32A, Article 2 NMSA 1978\" for \"this article\"; in Subsection C, substituted \"facilities'\" for \"facilities\"; and rewrote Subsection D.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-6 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nLegislative intent.— The provisions are clear - no child shall be detained in a detention facility unless it has met all standards and is certified as approved by the youth authority (now children, youth and families department). To be so certified and approved, a detention facility must provide detained children with complete sight and sound segregation from adult inmates. A waiver of these requirements by the child and his parents would not relieve the youth authority (now children, youth and families department) of its statutory duty to enforce its certification standards as required by law. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-16.\n\nChild in need of supervision may not be held in jail.— A child alleged to be delinquent or in need of supervision, and the child's parents, cannot sign a waiver which would allow the child to be detained pending final adjudication in a local jail facility with total sight and only partial sound segregation from adult jail detainees. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-16.\n\nLaw reviews.— For survey, \"Children's Court Practice in Delinquency and Need of Supervision Cases Under the New Rules,\" see 6 N.M.L. Rev. 331 (1976).\n\nAm.

Complaints alleging delinquency shall be referred to probation services, which shall conduct a preliminary inquiry to determine the best interests of the child and of the public with regard to any action to be taken.\n\nB. During the preliminary inquiry on a delinquency complaint, the matter may be referred to another appropriate agency and conferences may be conducted for the purpose of effecting adjustments or agreements that will obviate the necessity for filing a petition. At the commencement of the preliminary inquiry, the parties shall be advised of their basic rights pursuant to Section 32A-2-14 NMSA 1978, and no party may be compelled to appear at any conference, to produce any papers or to visit any place. The child shall be informed of the child's right to remain silent. The preliminary inquiry shall be completed within the time limits set forth in the Children's Court Rules.\n\nC. Prior to a preliminary inquiry being conducted with a child who is detained, the child's parent, guardian or custodian or the child's attorney shall be given reasonable notice by the juvenile probation and parole officer and an opportunity to be present at the preliminary inquiry. If a child is not detained, the preliminary inquiry shall be conducted within thirty days of receipt of the referral from law enforcement. The thirty-day time period may be extended upon a determination by the department that an extension is necessary to conduct a thorough preliminary inquiry and that the extension is not prejudicial to the best interests of the child.\n\nD. When a child is in detention or custody and the children's court attorney does not file a petition within the time limits authorized by the Children's Court Rules, the child shall be released immediately. If a child is not detained and a determination is made to file a petition, the petition shall be filed within sixty days of completion of the preliminary inquiry, unless a motion is granted to extend the time limit for good cause shown. If a child is not in custody or detention, a petition shall not be dismissed for failure to comply with the time limit set forth in this subsection unless there is a showing of prejudice to the child.\n\nE. After completion of the preliminary inquiry on a delinquency complaint involving a misdemeanor, probation services may notify the children's court attorney and recommend an appropriate disposition for the case. If the child has been referred for three or more prior misdemeanors within two years of the instant offense, probation services shall notify the children's court attorney and recommend an appropriate disposition for the case.\n\nF. Probation services shall notify the children's court attorney of the receipt of any complaint involving an act that constitutes a felony under the applicable criminal law. Probation services shall also recommend a disposition to the children's court attorney.\n\nG. The child, through counsel, and the children's court attorney may agree, without judicial approval, to a waiver of time limitations imposed after a petition is filed. A time waiver defers adjudication of the charges. The children's court attorney may place restrictions on a child's behavior as a condition of a time waiver. If the child completes the agreed upon conditions and no new charges are filed against the child, the pending petition shall be dismissed. If the children's court attorney files a new petition against the child, the children's court attorney may proceed on both the original petition and the new charges. The department shall become a party if probation services are requested as a condition of the time waiver.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-7, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 36; 2005, ch. 189, § 12.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, in Subsection B, provided that in a preliminary inquiry the child shall be informed of the child's right to remain silent; added Subsection C, which provided that prior to a preliminary inquiry concerning a child who is detained, the child's parent, guardian or custodian or attorney shall be given notice by the juvenile probation and parole officer and an opportunity to be present; that if the child is not detained, the inquiry shall be conducted within thirty days after receipt of referral from law enforcement; and that the thirty day period may be extended if the extension is necessary to conduct a thorough inquiry and the extension is not prejudicial to the child; and in Subsection D, provided that if a child is not detained and a determination is made to file a petition, the petition shall be filed within sixty days after completion of the preliminary inquiry, unless a motion is granted to extend the time and that if a child is not in custody or detention, a petition shall not be dismissed for failure to comply with the time limit unless the child is prejudiced.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-14 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nLegislative intent.— The legislature intended that there be prompt adjudication of cases under the Children's Code.Doe v.

A person taking a child into custody shall, with all reasonable speed:\n\n(1) release the child to the child's parent, guardian or custodian or an adult authorized by the child's parent, guardian or custodian and issue verbal counsel or warning as may be appropriate;\n\n(2) release the child to the child's parent, guardian or custodian or an adult authorized to sign on behalf of the child's parent, guardian or custodian upon written promise to bring the child before the court when requested by the court. If the parent, guardian or custodian or an adult authorized to sign on behalf of the child's parent, guardian or custodian fails, when requested, to bring the child before the court as promised, the court may order the child taken into custody and brought before the court;\n\n(3) deliver the child to a place of detention as provided in Section 32A-2-12 NMSA 1978;\n\n(4) deliver the child to a medical facility, if available, if the child is believed to be suffering from a serious illness that requires prompt treatment or prompt diagnosis;\n\n(5) deliver the child to an evaluation facility, if available, if the person taking the child into custody has reasonable grounds to believe the child presents a likelihood of serious harm to the child's self or others or is suffering from some other serious mental condition or illness that requires prompt treatment or prompt diagnosis; or\n\n(6) deliver the child to a center or organization that the court or the department recognizes as an alternative to secure detention.\n\nB. When an alleged delinquent child is delivered to a place of detention or a center or organization recognized as an alternative to secure detention as provided in Section 32A-2-12 NMSA 1978, only a department employee or a trained county detention professional designated by the department may place the child in detention or with a center or organization recognized as an alternative to secure detention in accordance with the criteria for detention set forth in Section 32A-2-11 NMSA 1978. If the criteria for detention of an alleged delinquent child are not met, the child shall be released from custody.\n\nC. A child under the age of twelve shall not be held in detention. If a child under the age of twelve poses a substantial risk of harm to the child's self or others, a peace officer may detain and transport that child for emergency mental health evaluation and care in accordance with Section 32A-6A-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nD. If a child is taken into custody and is not released to the child's parent, guardian or custodian or an adult authorized by the child's parent, guardian or custodian, the person taking the child into custody shall give written notice thereof as soon as possible, and in no case later than twenty-four hours, to the child's parent, guardian or custodian or an adult authorized by the child's parent, guardian or custodian and to the court, together with a statement of the reason for taking the child into custody.\n\nE. In all cases when a child is taken into custody, the child shall be released to the child's parent, guardian or custodian or an adult authorized by the child's parent, guardian or custodian in accordance with the conditions and time limits set forth in the Children's Court Rules.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-10, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 39; 2003, ch. 225, § 5; 2005, ch. 189, § 13.; 2009, ch. 239, § 14; 2023, ch. 125, § 1.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, raised the age limit at which a child may be held in custody to twelve years of age or older; and in Subsection C, after each occurrence of \"age of\", changed \"eleven\" to \"twelve\".\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Paragraph (1) of Subsection A, after \"guardian or custodian\", added \"or an adult authorized by the child's parent, guardian or custodian\"; in Paragraph (2) of Subsection A, after \"guardian or custodian\", added \"or an adult authorized to sign on behalf of the child's parent, guardian or custodian\"; added Paragraph (6) of Subsection A; in Subsection B, after \"a place of detention\" added \"or a center or organization recognized as an alternative to secure detention\" and after \"place the child in detention\", added \"or with a center or organization recognized as an alternative to secure detention\"; in Subsection C, changed the reference from Section 32A-6-11 NMSA 1978 to Section 32A-6A-19 NMSA 1978; in Subsection D, in two places, after \"guardian or custodian\", added \"or an adult authorized by the child's parent, guardian or custodian\"; and in Subsection E, after \"guardian or custodian\", added \"or an adult authorized by the child's parent, guardian or custodian\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added Subsection D to provide that a child under the age of eleven shall not be held in detention and that if a child under eleven poses a risk or harm to himself or others, a peace officer may detain and transport the child for emergency mental health evaluation and care.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, substituted \"Section 32A-2-12\" for \"Section 32-2-11\" in Paragraph A(3); rewrote Subsection B; and deleted \"and Forms\" at the end of Subsection D.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-23 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nScope of custody.— While there appears to be no doubt that juveniles may be taken into custody for the purpose of questioning, care must be exercised as to what is done with them after the taking of custody, particularly in view of the provision of the law that a juvenile is not to be unduly detained in a prison or jail. Furthermore, in most cases, the juvenile should be released to the custody of his parent or other responsible adult until his case is to be disposed of. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-166 (see 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-56).\n\nNo detention in absence of court order or probation determination.— In the absence of a court order, detention was not permitted by statute in the absence of the juvenile probation office's determination that it is warranted. Thus the city police, acting on their own, may not detain a child. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-58.\n\nNo bail or bond as of right.— Under the Juvenile (now Children's) Code, a juvenile is not entitled to bail nor is he entitled, as a matter of right, to bond on supersedeas after a determination has been made that he is a juvenile delinquent and a sentence of detention has been passed against him. Of course, so far as the question of supersedeas bond is concerned, the matter would be under the rules of the court and discretionary with the court. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen.

The criteria for detention in this section shall govern the decisions of all persons responsible for determining whether detention is appropriate prior to a detention hearing, based upon review of the detention risk assessment instrument.\n\nC. The department shall develop and implement a detention risk assessment instrument. The department shall collect and analyze data regarding the application of the detention risk assessment instrument. On January 1, 2004, the department shall provide the legislature with a written report with respect to its collection and analysis of data regarding the application of the detention risk assessment instrument.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-11, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 40; 2003, ch. 225, § 6.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, rewrote the section.\n\nDetention at boys' school.— This statute does not preclude detention of a child at a boys' school pending an adjudicatory hearing on a delinquency petition; the purpose of the confinement determines whether a child is in detention or commitment at the school.State v. Anthony M., 1998-NMCA-065, 125 N.M. 149, 958 P.2d 107, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 145, 958 P.2d 103.\n\nSchool resource officer did not place child in \"detention\".— Where plaintiff, a middle-school student who was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, was arrested and charged with interference with members of staff, public officials or general public pursuant to § 30-20-13(D) NMSA 1978 after going to his regularly scheduled class when he was scheduled for an in-school suspension, and where plaintiff claimed that defendant, the school resource officer violated this section, which dictates that a child taken into custody for an alleged delinquent act shall not be placed in detention unless a detention risk assessment instrument is completed and certain determinations are made, plaintiff's claims failed as a matter of law because defendant placed plaintiff into custody and was not responsible for deciding whether plaintiff would be placed into detention. Defendant, acting within the scope of his duties could not have violated any of plaintiff's rights under the Children's Code regarding detention.Castaneda v.

A child alleged to be a youthful offender may be detained, pending a court hearing, in any of the following places:\n\n(1) a detention facility, licensed by the department, for children alleged to be delinquent children; or\n\n(2) any other suitable place, other than a facility for the long-term care and rehabilitation of delinquent children to which children adjudicated as delinquent children may be confined pursuant to Section 32A-2-19 NMSA 1978, designated by the court and that meets the standards for detention facilities pursuant to the Children's Code and federal law.\n\nC. A child adjudicated as a youthful offender who is violent toward staff or other residents in a detention facility may be transferred and detained, pending a court hearing, in a county jail. In the event that a child is detained in a jail, the director of the jail shall presume that the child is vulnerable to victimization by inmates within the adult population because of the child's age, and shall take measures to provide protection to the child. However, provision of protective measures shall not result in diminishing a child's civil rights to less than those existing for an incarcerated adult.\n\nD. A child who has previously been incarcerated as an adult or a person eighteen years of age or older shall not be detained in a juvenile detention facility or a facility for the long-term care and rehabilitation of delinquent children, but may be detained in a county jail. A child shall not be transferred to a county jail solely on the basis of attaining the age of eighteen while detained in a juvenile detention facility. In the event that a child is detained in a jail, the director of the jail shall presume that the child is vulnerable to victimization by inmates within the adult population because of the child's age, and shall take measures to provide protection to the child. However, provision of protective measures shall not result in diminishing a child's civil rights to less than those existing for an incarcerated adult.\n\nE. A child alleged to be a serious youthful offender may be detained pending a court hearing in any of the following places, prior to arraignment in metropolitan, magistrate or district court:\n\n(1) a detention facility, licensed by the department, for children alleged to be delinquent children;\n\n(2) any other suitable place, other than a facility for the long-term care and rehabilitation of delinquent children to which children adjudicated as delinquent children may be confined pursuant to Section 32A-2-19 NMSA 1978, designated by the court that meets the standards for detention facilities pursuant to the Children's Code and federal law; or\n\n(3) a county jail, if a facility in Paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection is not appropriate. In the event that a child is detained in a jail, the director of the jail shall presume that the child is vulnerable to victimization by inmates within the adult population because of the child's age and shall take measures to provide protection to the child.

When a person who is eighteen years of age or older is taken into custody and transported to an adult facility on a juvenile warrant or an adult warrant or other adult charges and an outstanding juvenile warrant exists, notice shall be given to the children's court attorney and the juvenile probation and parole office in the jurisdiction where the juvenile warrant was issued within one day of the person being taken into custody. The juvenile probation and parole office shall give notice that the person has been taken into custody to the children's court judge and the attorney who represented the person in the juvenile proceeding.\n\nG. In addition to the judicial review required by Paragraph (3) of Subsection A of this section, a child detained in an out-of-home placement pursuant to this section may request judicial review of the appropriateness of the placement.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-12, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 41; 2003, ch. 225, § 7; 2005, ch. 189, § 14; 2009, ch. 239, § 15.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Paragraph (3) of Subsection A, after \"Children's Shelter Care Act\", deleted \"or a detention facility certified by the department for children alleged to be delinquent children\" and added the remainder of the sentence; added Paragraph (4) of Subsection A; in Subsection D, added the second sentence; and added Subsection G.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added Subsection F, which provided that when a person who is eighteen years of age or older is taken into custody and transported to an adult facility and an outstanding warranty exists, notice shall be given to the children's court attorney and the juvenile probation and parole officer in the jurisdiction where the warrant was issued within one day after the person is taken into custody and that the juvenile probation and parole officer shall give notice to the children's court judge and the person's attorney.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, in Paragraphs A(4) and E(2), substituted \"pursuant to Section 32A-2-19\" for \"under Section 32-2-19\" following \"may be confined\", substituted \"pursuant to\" for \"under\" following \"for detention facilities\"; added Paragraph A(5); added present Subsections B to D and redesignated former Subsection B as Subsection E; in Paragraph E(3), substituted \"jail\" for \"facility\" following \"director of the\", substituted \"inmates\" for \"detainees\" following \"to victimization by\", and substituted \"provision of protective measures shall not\" for \"no such protective measure should\" following \"However\".\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-25 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nChild in need of supervision may not be held in jail.— Under no circumstances may a child in need of supervision be held in a jail or other facility intended or used for the incarceration of adults charged with criminal offenses or for the detention of children alleged to be delinquent children. This prohibition includes jail lock-up, drunk tanks or county jails. Every effort should be made to expedite transfer of physical custody of the child in need of supervision to a suitable shelter-care facility. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-08.\n\nEffect of waiver.— A child alleged to be delinquent or in need of supervision, and the child's parents, cannot sign a waiver which would allow the child to be detained pending final adjudication in a local jail facility with total sight and only partial sound segregation from adult jail detainees. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-16.\n\nDetention of child until bond posted not permitted.— City police acting unilaterally may not detain a child in jail until his parents post bond.

When a child who has been taken into custody is not released but is detained:\n\n(1) a judicial determination of probable cause shall be made by a judge or special master or magistrate within forty-eight hours, including Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, except for children taken into custody under an arrest warrant pursuant to the Children's Court Rules [10-101 NMRA]. A statement by a law enforcement officer, which shall include the charges, may be the basis of a probable cause determination. The probable cause determination shall be nonadversarial, may be held in the absence of the child and counsel and may be conducted by telephone. If the court finds no probable cause to believe the child committed an offense, the child shall be released;\n\n(2) a petition shall be filed within twenty-four hours from the time the child is taken into custody, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, and if not filed within the stated time, the child shall be released; and\n\n(3) a detention hearing shall be held within twenty-four hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, from the time of filing the petition to determine whether continued detention is required pursuant to the criteria established by the Children's Code. At the request of any party, the court may permit a detention hearing to be conducted by appropriate means of electronic communication; provided that all hearings conducted by electronic means shall be recorded and preserved as part of the record, the child shall have legal representation present with the child, no plea shall be allowed to be taken via electronic communication and the court finds:\n\n(a) that undue hardship will result from conducting the hearing with all parties, including the child, present in the courtroom; and\n\n(b) that the hardship substantially outweighs any prejudice or harm to the child that is likely to result from the hearing being conducted by electronic means.\n\nB. The judge may appoint one or more persons to serve as special master on a full- or part-time basis for the purpose of holding detention hearings. A juvenile probation and parole officer shall not be appointed as a special master. The judge shall approve all contracts with special masters and shall fix their hourly compensation, subject to the approval of the director of the administrative office of the courts.\n\nC. Notice of the detention hearing, either oral or written, stating the time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be given by the person designated by the court to the child's parents, guardian or custodian, if they can be found, and to the child. The department shall be provided with reasonable oral or written notification and an opportunity to be heard. At any hearing held pursuant to this subsection, the department may appear as a party.\n\nD. At the commencement of the detention hearing, the judge or special master shall advise the parties of their basic rights provided in the Children's Code and shall appoint counsel, guardians and custodians, if appropriate.\n\nE. If the judge or special master finds that the child's detention is appropriate under the criteria established by the Children's Code, the judge or special master shall order detention in an appropriate facility in accordance with the Children's Code.\n\nF. If the judge or special master finds that detention of the child is not appropriate under the criteria established by the Children's Code, the judge or special master shall order the release of the child, but, in so doing, may order one or more of the following conditions to meet the individual needs of the child:\n\n(1) place the child in the custody of a parent, guardian or custodian or under the supervision of an agency agreeing to supervise the child;\n\n(2) place restrictions on the child's travel, association with other persons or place of abode during the period of the child's release; or\n\n(3) impose any other condition deemed reasonably necessary and consistent with the criteria for detaining children established by the Children's Code, including a condition requiring that the child return to custody as required.\n\nG. An order releasing a child on any conditions specified in this section may at any time be amended to impose additional or different conditions of release or to return the child to custody or detention for failure to conform to the conditions originally imposed.\n\nH. At the detention hearing, all relevant and material evidence helpful in determining the need for detention may be admitted by the judge or special master even though it would not be admissible in a hearing on the petition.\n\nI. If the child is not released at the detention hearing and a parent, guardian or custodian was not notified of the hearing and did not appear or waive appearance at the detention hearing, the judge or special master shall rehear the detention matter without unnecessary delay upon the filing of an affidavit stating the facts and a motion for rehearing.\n\nJ. If a child is not released at the detention hearing, the child's detention may be subsequently reviewed by the court or the court may review the child's detention in conjunction with a pretrial conference.\n\nK. If a child is not placed within ten days after a disposition hearing, the child may be released and placed under appropriate supervision, so long as the child does not pose a flight risk or substantial risk of harm to the child's self or others.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-13, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 42; 2003, ch. 225, § 8; 2009, ch. 239, § 16.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Paragraph (3) of Subsection A, added the last sentence; and added Subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Paragraph (3) of Subsection A.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, deleted \"and Forms\" following \"Children's Court Rules\" in Paragraph A(1); substituted \"twenty-four\" for \"forty-eight\" following \"be filed within\" in Paragraph A(2); inserted \"to meet the individual needs of the child\" at the end of Subsection F; and added Subsections J and K.\n\nGrade court.— Where the grade court program conditions were laid out in the grade court order child signed and the detention sanction set out in the grade court order, by its terms, applied to violations of conditions of probation and not to conditions of release, once child accepted the conditions of release, the court had authority to order detention, based on his failure to comply with those conditions.State v.

If after due notice to the parent, guardian or custodian and after a hearing determining indigency, the parent, guardian or custodian is declared indigent by the court, the public defender shall represent the child.

In determining whether the child knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the child's rights, the court shall consider the following factors:\n\n(1) the age and education of the respondent;\n\n(2) whether the respondent is in custody;\n\n(3) the manner in which the respondent was advised of the respondent's rights;\n\n(4) the length of questioning and circumstances under which the respondent was questioned;\n\n(5) the condition of the quarters where the respondent was being kept at the time of being questioned;\n\n(6) the time of day and the treatment of the respondent at the time of being questioned;\n\n(7) the mental and physical condition of the respondent at the time of being questioned; and\n\n(8) whether the respondent had the counsel of an attorney, friends or relatives at the time of being questioned.\n\nF. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, no confessions, statements or admissions may be introduced against a child under the age of thirteen years on the allegations of the petition. There is a rebuttable presumption that any confessions, statements or admissions made by a child thirteen or fourteen years old to a person in a position of authority are inadmissible.\n\nG. An extrajudicial admission or confession made by the child out of court is insufficient to support a finding that the child committed the delinquent acts alleged in the petition unless it is corroborated by other evidence.\n\nH. The child and the parent, guardian or custodian of the child shall be advised by the court or its representative that the child shall be represented by counsel at all stages of the proceedings on a delinquency petition, including all post-dispositional court proceedings. If counsel is not retained for the child or if it does not appear that counsel will be retained, counsel shall be appointed for the child.\n\nI. A child under the age of thirteen alleged or adjudicated to be a delinquent child shall not be fingerprinted or photographed for identification purposes without obtaining a court order.\n\nJ. The court, at any stage of the proceeding on a petition under the Children's Code, may appoint a guardian ad litem for a child who is a party if the child has no parent, guardian or custodian appearing on behalf of the child or if the parent's, guardian's or custodian's interests conflict with those of the child. A party to the proceeding or an employee or representative of a party shall not be appointed as guardian ad litem.\n\nK. The court shall appoint a guardian for a child if the court determines that the child does not have a parent or a legally appointed guardian in a position to exercise effective guardianship. No officer or employee of an agency that is vested with the legal custody of the child shall be appointed guardian of the child except when parental rights have been terminated and the agency is authorized to place the child for adoption.\n\nL. A person afforded rights under the Delinquency Act shall be advised of those rights at that person's first appearance before the court on a petition under that act.\n\nM. A serious youthful offender who is detained prior to trial in an adult facility has a right to bail as provided under SCRA 1986, Rule 5-401. A child held in a juvenile facility designated as a place of detention prior to adjudication does not have a right to bail but may be released pursuant to the provisions of the Delinquency Act.\n\nN. The provisions of the Delinquency Act shall not be interpreted to limit the right of a child to petition a court for a writ of habeas corpus.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-14, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 43; 2003, ch. 225, § 9; 2009, ch. 239, § 17.\n\nCross references.— For general provisions, basic rights,see32A-1-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor explanation of basic rights in the Children's Court,seeRule 10-224 NMRA.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection A, after \"Children's Code\", added the remainder of the sentence; and in Subsection H, in the first sentence, after \"delinquency petition\", added the remainder of the sentence.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, deleted \"or not\" near the beginning of Paragraphs E(2) and (8) and added Subsection N.\n\nConfession found voluntary.— Where a child, who was almost seventeen years of age, confessed to murder while the child was held in a detention center; at the officer's request, the child agreed to visit with the officers; the officers read the child the child's Miranda rights, told the child that the interview would stop if the child wanted it to stop, and informed the child about the possible consequences of a conviction of murder; the child acknowledged by a nod of the head the reading of each Miranda right and after the rights were read, stated that the child understood the child's Miranda rights; the officers, at the child's request, brought the child's mother into the interview room before they began questioning the child; during the interview, the child asked if the child could visit with the child's mother alone; the officers refused the request and the child then asked the child's mother to leave the room; the officers asked child to explain what happened; the child then confessed to the murder; the interview lasted less than one hour; the child had a lengthy juvenile arrest record, had been read Miranda rights on previous occasions, and on one occasion had refused to speak to authorities without a lawyer; and although a clinical psychologist testified that the child suffered from ADHD, that the child's primary language was Spanish, that the child was raised in a traditional Latino household that made the child deferential to authority figures which would enable the officers to convince the child to confess, the child spoke fluent English, never claimed not to understand the questions, and gave detailed, narrative responses to the questions; the officers told the child that the officers could not promise the child anything about a possible sentence or disposition, and after confessing to the murder, the child asked the officers what they thought might happen, the child knowingly and intelligently waived the child's Miranda rights, voluntarily consented to the interrogation, and voluntarily confessed.State v. Gutierrez, 2011-NMSC-024, 150 N.M. 232, 258 P.3d 1024.\n\nRight to speedy trial.— Constitutional speedy-trial requirements guaranteed under the sixth amendment of the United States constitution also apply in children's court proceedings in New Mexico.In re Darcy S., 1997-NMCA-026, 123 N.M. 206, 936 P.2d 888.\n\nAdmissibility of statements of a child under thirteen.— The confessions, statements, or admissions of individuals under thirteen years of age regardless of the context in which, or to whom, they were made are not admissible in a delinquency proceeding.State v. Jade G., 2007-NMSC-010, 141 N.M. 284, 154 P.3d 659.\n\nAdmissibility of fingerprints of a child under thirteen.— Where the fingerprints of a child under the age of thirteen are taken pursuant to a search warrant, before a formal petition of delinquency is filed, the protections of this section do not apply and cannot be used as the basis to exclude the child's fingerprints from evidence at the delinquency hearing.State v. Jade G., 2007-NMSC-010, 141 N.M. 284, 154 P.3d 659.\n\nResults of field sobriety tests are not statements.— Evidence of a child's lack of muscular coordination during field sobriety tests and the child's response to an officer's request that the child count during the one-leg-stand test are not statements that are subject to suppression under Subsection D of Section 32A-2-14 NMSA 1978.State v. Randy J., 2011-NMCA-105, 150 N.M. 683, 265 P.3d 734, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 903.\n\nConsent to blood test is not a statement.— A child's consent to take a blood test pursuant to the Implied Consent Act is not a statement under Subsection D of Section 32A-2-14 NMSA 1978, because the child's consent is implied as a matter of law under Section 66-8-107 NMSA 1978.State v. Randy J., 2011-NMCA-105, 150 N.M. 683, 265 P.3d 734, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 903.\n\nResults of a blood test are not statements.— A child's blood test results is not a statement under Subsection D of Section 32A-2-14 NMSA 1978.State v. Randy J., 2011-NMCA-105, 150 N.M. 683, 265 P.3d 734, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 903.\n\nPhysical evidence of DUI.— Where a child, who was sixteen years of age, was subject to investigatory detention for DUI; the police officer failed to inform the child of the child's constitutional rights as required by Section 32A-2-14 NMSA 1978; the officer had the child perform the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN), walk-and-turn, and one-leg-stand field sobriety tests; and after the officer read the Implied Consent Act to the child, the child consented to a blood test, the results of the field sobriety tests, the child's consent to a blood test, and the results of the blood test were not statements subject to suppression under Subsection D of Section 32A-2-14 NMSA 1978.State v. Randy J., 2011-NMCA-105, 150 N.M. 683, 265 P.3d 734, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 903.\n\nConstitutionality of Subsection F.— The rebuttable presumption that the statements and confessions of a child under 13 years are inadmissible is in accord with the legislative purpose of providing extra protection for the very young, and the provision was not unconstitutional as applied to a 16-year-old defendant.State v. Setser, 1997-NMSC-004, 122 N.M. 794, 932 P.2d 484.\n\nPresumption in Subsection F.— The term \"rebuttable presumption,\" in Subsection F, is not used in exclusive reference to the factors of Subsection E; rather, it relates to admissibility, and it precludes the children's court from treating a 13 or 14-year-old child in the same manner as a child over the age of 14 or an adult.In re Francesca L., 2000-NMCA-019, 128 N.M. 673, 997 P.2d 147, cert. quashed, 132 N.M. 194, 46 P.3d 101, holding limited byState v. Adam J., 2003-NMCA-080, 133 N.M. 815, 70 P.3d 805, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-006, 133 N.M. 771, 70 P.3d 761..\n\nIf the court is not satisfied that the rebuttable presumption of Subsection F of this section has been overcome based on the personal traits of the child, the court's inquiry is complete and the confession, statement, or admission in question is inadmissible. To the extent thatIn re Francesca L., 2000-NMCA-019, 128 N.M. 673, 997 P.2d 147, cert. quashed, 132 N.M. 194, 46 P.3d 101, states to the contrary, it is overruled,State v. Adam J., 2003-NMCA-080, 133 N.M. 815, 70 P.3d 805, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-006, 133 N.M. 771, 70 P.3d 761.\n\nSubsection F is construed to eliminate application of Subsection Gof this section, which permits corroborated extrajudicial admissions and confessions.State v. Jade G., 2005-NMCA-019, 137 N.M. 128, 108 P.3d 534,aff'd,2007-NMSC-010, 141 N.M. 284, 154 P.3d 659.\n\nChild's statements inadmissible.— Subsection F of this section plainly forbids admission of the statements child made to relatives and neighbors regarding the shooting of her father by the child.State v. Jade G., 2005-NMCA-019, 137 N.M. 128, 108 P.3d 534, aff'd, 2007-NMSC-010, 141 N.M. 284, 154 P.3d 659.\n\nThirteen-year-old child's incriminating statement made to an assistant principal was presumptively inadmissible.— Where child, a thirteen-year-old student, was charged with the delinquent act of unlawful carrying of a deadly weapon on school premises, and where child moved to suppress incriminating statements he made to an assistant principal and to the school resource officer, and where the district court entered an order granting the suppression of child's statement to the school resource officer, but otherwise denied the motion, the district court erred in partially denying child's motion to suppress, because the assistant principal was a person in a position of authority, and as such, the district court erred by not concluding that child's statement to the assistant principal was presumptively inadmissible under Subsection F of this section.State v. Cesar B., 2020-NMCA-048.\n\nState's burden of proof in rebutting the presumption of inadmissibility in Subsection F.— To overcome the presumption of inadmissibility in Subsection F of this section, the state must prove by clear and convincing evidence that at the time the thirteen or fourteen-year-old child made his or her statement to a person in a position of authority, the child had the maturity to understand his or her constitutional and statutory rights and the force of will to invoke such rights. In order to obtain the clear and convincing evidence needed to rebut the presumption of inadmissibility, the interrogator who is in a position of authority must first adequately advise the thirteen or fourteen-year-old child of his or her Miranda and statutory rights and then invite the child to explain, on the record, his or her actual comprehension and appreciation of each Miranda warning.State v. DeAngelo M., 2015-NMSC-033,aff'g on other grounds2015-NMCA-019.\n\nWhere thirteen-year-old child, charged with murder, residential burglary, tampering with evidence, and larceny, was subjected to a custodial interrogation by three law enforcement officers, during which child made inculpatory statements regarding a burglary that connected child to a murder, the trial court erred in denying child's motion to suppress the statements where the officers failed to advise child of his Miranda and statutory rights in a clear and intelligible manner and where it was not clear from the record that child fully comprehended and appreciated his constitutional and statutory rights. Moreover, the fact that child continued to answer questions after unambiguously asserting his right to remain silent provided additional evidence that child did not possess either the maturity to understand his rights or the force of will to assert those rights. The state did not meet its burden of rebutting the presumption of inadmissibility under 32A-2-14F NMSA 1978.State v. DeAngelo M., 2015-NMSC-033,aff'g on other grounds2015-NMCA-019.\n\nRebutting the presumption in Subsection F.— Rebutting the presumption in Subsection F of this section requires the state to present clear and convincing evidence that, in the totality of the circumstances, the child's personal traits give him an above-average ability to knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his rights in the way the statute presumes a fifteen-year-old child can.State v. DeAngelo M., 2015-NMCA-019, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-002.\n\nWhere thirteen-year-old child accused of murder, burglary, larceny and tampering with evidence, was on the lowest end of the age range at which his statements could be used, and where lay witnesses did not present evidence of the child's actual grades or test scores from his regular school or present evidence of any school records concerning the child, but based their opinion that the child had above average intelligence solely on a single interaction with the child during the interrogation, the state did not present clear and convincing evidence that the child had the capacity to understand his rights and understand the consequences of waiving those rights in the way a fifteen-year-old child would.State v. DeAngelo M., 2015-NMCA-019, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-002.\n\nConstruction.— Subsection C is an exception to the general rule in Subsection A that children are entitled to the same basic rights as adults; therefore, this section is not a mere codification of Miranda, but was intended instead to provide children with greater statutory protection than constitutionally mandated.State v. Javier M., 2001-NMSC-030, 131 N.M. 1, 33 P.3d 1.\n\nWaiver of Miranda rights.— Even though the 16-year-old defendant suffered from certain conditions and disorders that affected her cognitive abilities, there was no evidence that she lacked sufficient intelligence to understand her rights; therefore, her confession, given voluntarily after a valid waiver of her Miranda rights, was admissible.State v. Setser, 1997-NMSC-004, 122 N.M. 794, 932 P.2d 484.\n\nMotion to suppress 17-year-old defendant's statement was properly denied, because, although the interrogation took place at a police station while he was in handcuffs and without a parent present, he had previous experience with the court system and had been questioned by police officers and represented by attorneys in the past, there was no evidence that he needed to be provided with a special form in order to understand his rights or knowingly waive them, and, in view of his age and eleventh-grade education, his alert condition at the time of the interrogation, and the manner in which his rights were explained to him, he was more likely than not to understand and knowingly waive them, even without his parent present.State v. Lasner, 2000-NMSC-038, 129 N.M. 806, 14 P.3d 1282.\n\nIn evaluating the trial court's determination that 17-year-old defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights, it is necessary to look at the totality of circumstances, giving particular emphasis to the factors listed in Subsection E.State v. Martinez, 1999-NMSC-018, 127 N.M. 207, 979 P.2d 718.\n\nExpanded protections in Children's Code.— The Children's Code protections apply more broadly than the constitutional protections recognized in Miranda; the Children's Code protections apply in any scenario after a child has been subject to formal charges, in any scenario in which a child is subject to an investigative detention, and in any scenario at all in which a child is suspected of being a delinquent child.State v. Rivas, 2017-NMSC-022.\n\nWaiver of Miranda rights by juvenile defendant.— Where fifteen-year-old defendant, charged with first-degree murder, aggravated burglary, tampering with evidence, and unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, agreed to be interviewed by a police detective after having been advised of his rights, after being given an opportunity to read, and read aloud from, a standard advice of rights form before signing the form and indicating a desire to speak to the detective, where nothing in the record indicated that defendant lacked sufficient intelligence to understand his rights or the repercussions of waiving those rights or that defendant suffered from any impairment of mental or physical condition, and where there was no coercive or manipulative conduct by law enforcement, the totality of the circumstances indicated that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right against self-incrimination.State v. Rivas, 2017-NMSC-022.\n\nMiranda warning not required.— Police officers may ask questions about needles or weapons prior to pat-down search to assure safety of officers without giving the individual Miranda warning.State v. Gerald B., 2006-NMCA-022, 139 N.M. 113, 129 P.3d 149.\n\nUnwarned statements to probation officers are inadmissible in a subsequent prosecution.— Where defendant, a juvenile probationer, arrived at his probation office with his parents and voluntarily stated that he wanted to turn himself in for shooting and killing two people, and where his probation officer escorted defendant to a supervisor's office and talked to defendant until police arrived, but failed to advise defendant of his Miranda rights or his right to remain silent under 32A-2-14 NMSA 1978, the statements made in the supervisor's office were inadmissible in a subsequent prosecution, because after defendant made his initial voluntary statement in the lobby of the probation office, defendant was suspected of committing a new delinquent act, was not free to leave the probation office and was thus subject to an investigatory detention, and this section requires a child to be warned of the statutory right against self-incrimination when subject to an investigatory detention.State v. Filemon V., 2018-NMSC-011.\n\nMidstream Miranda warnings are ineffective in informing a suspect of his or her constitutional rights.— Where defendant, a juvenile probationer, arrived at his probation office with his parents and voluntarily stated that he wanted to turn himself in for shooting and killing two people, and where his probation officer escorted defendant to a supervisor's office and talked to defendant until police arrived, but failed to advise defendant of his Miranda rights or his right to remain silent under 32A-2-14 NMSA 1978, and where police transported defendant to the Silver City police department where defendant proceeded to give a full statement regarding the murders without being advised of his constitutional rights, and where defendant was subsequently taken to an interview room where he was read his Miranda warnings by the case agent assigned to the murder investigation and was instructed to sign a written waiver of rights, which defendant and his mother signed, and where defendant proceeded to give a second statement to police which included the same content as the first statement he gave to the police, the district court did not err in suppressing the post-Miranda statement, because the midstream Miranda warning was ineffective in informing defendant of his Miranda rights while he was in custodial interrogation; the first and second police interviews were effectively continuous and the officer did not remedy the initial failure to warn by informing defendant that his first statement could not be used against him at trial.State v. Filemon V., 2018-NMSC-011.\n\nFederal Miranda warnings not required prior to interview with probation officer.— Where a juvenile probationer admitted to his juvenile probation officer (JPO) that he had used drugs, the district court, in the ensuing probation revocation hearing, erred in granting the child's motion to suppress inculpatory statements based on the JPO's failure to give Miranda warnings to the child before questioning him, because Miranda's requirements do not apply to a probationer's statements made during an interview with his probation officer since the probationer is not in custody for purposes of receiving Miranda protection and there is no formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.State v. Taylor E., 2016-NMCA-100, cert. denied.\n\nWarning of statutory rights not required prior to interview with probation officer.— Where a juvenile probationer admitted to his juvenile probation officer that he had used drugs, the district court, in the ensuing probation revocation hearing, erred in granting the child's motion to suppress inculpatory statements based on the JPO's failure to advise the juvenile of his constitutional rights before questioning him, because the protections set forth in 32A-2-14(C) NMSA 1978 are triggered, not by a JPO's suspicion that a probationer may have violated a condition of probation or where the child is alleged in a revocation petition to have done so, but only when a child is subject to an investigatory detention and where a law enforcement officer questions a child based on a suspicion that the child has committed a delinquent act or where the child is alleged to have done so in a delinquency petition.State v. Taylor E., 2016-NMCA-100, cert. denied.\n\nWarning of right to withhold consent to field sobriety tests is not required.— A police officer is not required to advise a minor of a right to refuse to perform field sobriety tests.State v. Candace S., 2012-NMCA-030, 274 P.3d 774, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-002.\n\nThe failure of a police officer to advise a minor of a right to remain silent does not render field sobriety tests inadmissible, because the performance of field sobriety tests does not constitute statements subject to suppression.State v. Candace S., 2012-NMCA-030, 274 P.3d 774, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-002.\n\nFailure to advise minor of a right to remain silent and of a right to withhold consent to field sobriety tests.— Where a police officer had reasonable suspicion to administer field sobriety tests and breath alcohol tests to defendant who was a minor, the officer's failure to advise defendant of a right to remain silent and of a right to withhold consent to the tests did not render the tests inadmissible.State v. Candace S., 2012-NMCA-030, 274 P.3d 774, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-002.\n\nRights of a child during an investigatory detention.— Under this section, a child who is suspected or alleged of having committed a delinquent act cannot be interrogated or questioned during an investigatory detention unless the child is first advised of his or her statutory right to remain silent and the child knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waives his or her rights. The state bears the burden of proving that the child knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived the statutory right to remain silent. The remedy for violating this section is to preclude the admission, in court proceedings, of any statement or confession elicited from the child.State v. Antonio T., 2015-NMSC-019,rev'g2013-NMCA-035, 298 P.3d 484.\n\nWaiver of statutory right.— Where sixteen-year-old child made incriminatory statements during an investigatory detention after being suspected of committing the delinquent act of driving while intoxicated (DWI), evidence that officers conducted the DWI investigation in the public parking lot of a convenience store in plain view of store employees, traffic, and other members of the public entering and exiting the store, that the length of time between child's initial contact with police and his arrest for DWI lasted only twelve minutes, that the officer's demeanor toward child was professional and courteous and that there was no indication that child felt in fear of the interaction, and that the officer informed child of his right to remain silent, established that child understood his statutory right and the consequences of waiving that right. Under the totality of the circumstances, the evidence was consistent with a determination that child knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to remain silent.State v. Wyatt B., 2015-NMCA-110, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-010.\n\nQuestioning a child suspected of delinquent behavior by a school administrator in the presence of a law enforcement officer constitutes an investigatory detention.— When a child suspected of delinquent behavior is questioned in the presence of a law enforcement officer, that child is subjected to an investigatory detention, triggering the protections of 32A-2-14 NMSA 1978.State v. Antonio T., 2015-NMSC-019,rev'g2013-NMCA-035, 298 P.3d 484.\n\nWhere the assistant principal of a high school suspected a seventeen-year-old student of being intoxicated and questioned the child in the presence of the student resource officer, a certified law enforcement officer, the questioning of the child constituted an investigatory detention triggering the protections of 32A-2-14 NMSA 1978. The statements made by the child in response to the assistant principal's questions were inadmissible because the child was not advised of his statutory right to remain silent and the state failed to prove that the child knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his statutory right to remain silent.State v. Antonio T., 2015-NMSC-019,rev'g2013-NMCA-035, 298 P.3d 484.\n\nInterrogation of a student by a school administrator in the presence of a police officer.— Where a vice principal interrogated a high school student, who was suspected of being intoxicated, in the vice principal's office in the presence of a uniformed police officer; the purpose of the vice principal's investigation was to ensure the safety of defendant and other students; the vice principal called the officer to administer a breath test and to protect the vice principal; the officer administered the breath test on defendant and searched a bathroom where defendant said defendant had disposed of a bottle of alcohol; defendant admitted to drinking; and defendant's statements were used in a defendant's juvenile case, defendant was not entitled to Miranda warnings from the vice principal despite the presence of the police officer because the interrogation constituted an investigatory detention, not a custodial detention, and the vice principal was acting to serve the school's interests in a safe environment, not on behalf of law enforcement.State v. Antonio T., 2013-NMCA-035, 298 P.3d 484, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-003.\n\nSuppression not required.— When child volunteered that he possessed marijuana, in response to police officer's inquiry about needles during a pat-down search, child was not entitled under this section to the suppression of the statements or marijuana. State v. Gerald B., 2006-NMCA-022, 139 N.M. 113, 129 P.3d 149.\n\nState to prove voluntariness of confession.— Whether a juvenile knowingly and voluntarily waives his constitutional rights before giving a confession is an issue distinct from the competency of the juvenile, requires the consideration of different factors, and is an issue as to which the state carries the burden of proof; if the children's court fails to make the state prove by the preponderance of the evidence that a juvenile knowingly and voluntarily waived his or her rights, a delinquency determination may be reversed.State v. Jason F., 1998-NMSC-010, 125 N.M. 111, 957 P.2d 1145.\n\nInvestigatory detention triggers statute.— A child need not be under custodial interrogation in order to trigger the protections of this section. The protections are triggered when a child is subject to an investigatory detention and therefore, prior to questioning, a child who is detained or seized and suspected of wrongdoing must be advised that he or she has the right to remain silent and that anything said can be used in any delinquency hearing.State v. Javier M., 2001-NMSC-030, 131 N.M. 1, 33 P.3d 1.\n\nObjective standard of determining wrongdoing.— In the context of investigatory stops, determining whether a child is \"suspected\" of wrongdoing should be measured by an objective standard.State v. Javier M., 2001-NMSC-030, 131 N.M. 1, 33 P.3d 1.\n\nAdministrative questioning does not trigger statute.— This section does not require that officers give children constitutional warnings prior to: (1) questions pertaining to a child's age or identity; (2) general on-the-scene questioning; or (3) volunteered statements made by a child.State v. Javier M., 2001-NMSC-030, 131 N.M. 1, 33 P.3d 1.\n\nRemedy for violation.— If during an investigatory detention, a child is not advised of the right to remain silent and warned of the consequence of waiving that right, any statement or confession obtained as a result of the detention or seizure is inadmissible in any delinquency proceeding.State v. Javier M., 2001-NMSC-030, 131 N.M. 1, 33 P.3d 1.\n\nDismissal not a remedy.— There is no statutory provision for the dismissal of a delinquency petition based on a violation of any of the statutory rights granted under this section.In re Jade G., 2001-NMCA-058, 130 N.M. 687, 30 P.3d 376, cert. quashed, 132 N.M. 484, 51 P.3d 527 (2002),aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds,State v. Jade G., 2007-NMSC-010, 141 N.M. 284, 154 P.3d 659.\n\nPurpose of Subsection Iof this section is to afford greater protection for children under 13 than to older children and adults in regard to fingerprinting.State v. Jade G., 2005-NMCA-019, 137 N.M. 128, 108 P.3d 534,aff'd, 2007-NMSC-010, 141 N.M. 284, 154 P.3d 659.\n\nFingerprints.— An obvious purpose of Subsection I of this section is to require at some stage a judge's independent review of a request for a juvenile's fingerprints, to balance the accountability and protective purposes of the Delinquency Act with the protection to be afforded children under 13.State v. Jade G., 2005-NMCA-019, 137 N.M. 128, 108 P.3d 534,aff'd, 2007-NMSC-010, 141 N.M. 284, 154 P.3d 659.\n\nSpecial master's refusal to ruleon a juvenile's motion to suppress does not violate this rule if the children's court reviews the matter both before and after the adjudicatory hearing conducted by the special master.State v. Jason F., 1998-NMSC-010, 125 N.M. 111, 957 P.2d 1145.\n\nValidity of waiver.— Although Subsection E(8) of this section directs courts to consider the presence or absence of an attorney, friend, or relative at the questioning, that is merely one of the factors relevant in determining the validity of a waiver of rights, and there is no statutory requirement that parents be notified about a custodial interrogation of their juvenile child.State v. Martinez, 1999-NMSC-018, 127 N.M. 207, 979 P.2d 718.\n\nThe state was not required to prove that 17-year-old defendant expressly waived his rights in order to demonstrate a constitutionally valid waiver.State v. Martinez, 1999-NMSC-018, 127 N.M. 207, 979 P.2d 718.\n\nConsent of minor to vehicle search.— A police officer need not advise a minor of the right to refuse to consent in order to obtain the valid consent of the minor to search the minor's vehicle.State v. Carlos A., 2012-NMCA-069, 284 P.3d 384, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-006.\n\nWhere the minor, who was seventeen years of age, was stopped by a police officer for a traffic violation; the officer smelled the odor of marijuana; the minor consented to the search of the minor's vehicle; the officer did not advise the minor and the minor did not know that the minor had a right to refuse to consent; the contact between the minor and the officer was low-key, polite, cooperative, and not hostile; the officer did not exert any unusual pressure on the minor; and the encounter lasted about ten minutes from the time of the stop to the end of the vehicle search, there was substantial evidence that the minor voluntarily consented to the search of the vehicle.State v. Carlos A., 2012-NMCA-069, 284 P.3d 384, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-006.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Children's Law: Investigatory Detention of Juveniles in New Mexico: Providing Greater Protection than Miranda Rights for Children in the Area of Police Questioning -State of New Mexico v.

      "text": "A. Hearings on petitions shall be conducted by the court separate from other proceedings. A jury trial on the issues of alleged delinquent acts may be demanded by the child, parent, guardian, custodian or counsel in proceedings on petitions alleging delinquency when the offense alleged would be triable by jury if committed by an adult. If a jury is demanded and the child is entitled to a jury trial, the jury's function is limited to that of trier of the factual issue of whether the child committed the alleged delinquent acts. If no jury is demanded, the hearing shall be by the court without a jury. Jury trials shall be conducted in accordance with rules promulgated under the provisions of Subsection B of Section 32A-1-5 NMSA 1978. A delinquent child facing a juvenile disposition shall be entitled to a six-member jury. If the children's court attorney has filed a motion to invoke an adult sentence, the child is entitled to a twelve-member jury. A unanimous verdict is required for all jury trials. The proceedings shall be recorded by stenographic notes or by electronic, mechanical or other appropriate means.\n\nB. All hearings to declare a person in contempt of court and all hearings on petitions pursuant to the provisions of the Delinquency Act shall be open to the general public, except where the court in its discretion, after a finding of exceptional circumstances, deems it appropriate to conduct a closed delinquency hearing. Only the parties, their counsel, witnesses and other persons approved by the court may be present at a closed hearing. Those other persons the court finds to have a proper interest in the case or in the work of the court may be admitted by the court to closed hearings on the condition that they refrain from divulging any information concerning the exceptional circumstances that resulted in the need for a closed hearing. Accredited representatives of the news media shall be allowed to be present at closed hearings subject to the conditions that they refrain from divulging information concerning the exceptional circumstances that resulted in the need for a closed hearing and subject to such enabling regulations as the court finds necessary for the maintenance of order and decorum and for the furtherance of the purposes of the Delinquency Act.\n\nC. Those persons or parties granted admission to a closed hearing who intentionally divulge information in violation of Subsection B of this section are guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nD. The court shall determine if the allegations of the petition are admitted or denied. If the allegations are denied, the court shall proceed to hear evidence on the petition. The court after hearing all of the evidence bearing on the allegations of delinquency shall make and record its findings on whether the delinquent acts subscribed to the child were committed by the child. If the court finds that the allegations of delinquency have not been established, it shall dismiss the petition and order the child released from any detention or legal custody imposed in connection with the proceedings.\n\nE. The court shall make a finding of delinquency based on a valid admission of the allegations of the petition or on the basis of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nF. If the court finds on the basis of a valid admission of the allegations of the petition or on the basis of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the child is a delinquent, the court may proceed immediately or at a postponed hearing to make disposition of the case.\n\nG. In that part of the hearings held under the Delinquency Act on dispositional issues, all relevant and material evidence helpful in determining the questions presented, including oral and written reports, may be received by the court and may be relied upon to the extent of its probative value even though not competent had it been offered during the part of the hearings on adjudicatory issues.\n\nH. On the court's motion or that of a party, the court may continue the hearing on the petition for a reasonable time to receive reports and other evidence in connection with disposition. The court may continue the hearing pending the receipt of the predisposition study and report if that document has not been prepared and received. During any continuances under this subsection, the court shall make an appropriate order for detention or legal custody.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-16, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 45; 2009, ch. 239, § 18.\n\nCross references.— For sentencing for petty misdemeanors,see31-19-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection A, in the fifth sentence, changed the reference from Section 32-1-4 NMSA 1978 to Section 32A-1-5 NMSA 1978.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-31 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nPurpose of proceeding to determine \"delinquency\"is to decide whether the accused is responsible for prohibited conduct and, when criminal, the consequences may be the same as in the case of an adult. Indeed, it is even possible that ultimately this could result in the juvenile being incarcerated in the penitentiary with adult offenders.Peyton v. Nord, 1968-NMSC-027, 78 N.M. 717, 437 P.2d 716.\n\nCriteria for detention.— This section does not require the court to consider criteria for detention before entering such an order.State v. Steven B., 2004-NMCA-086, 136 N.M. 111, 94 P.3d 854, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-007, 136 N.M. 452, 99 P.3d 1164.\n\nSubsections F and H of this section do not permit the children's court to wholly bypass the criteria for detention.State v. Steven B., 2004-NMCA-086, 136 N.M. 111, 94 P.3d 854, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-007, 136 N.M. 452, 99 P.3d 1164.\n\nNo conflict with 10-229B NMRA.— There is no conflict between the time limit within which a dispositional hearing must be held under 10-229B NMRA (now 10-246 NMRA) and Section 32-1-31H NMSA 1978 (now Subsection H of this section) granting discretion to the children's court in a wide variety of circumstances; the rule simply states that in one specific circumstance that discretion should not be exercised to delay a hearing.In re Paul T., 1994-NMCA-123, 118 N.M. 538, 882 P.2d 1051.\n\nAcceptance of admission by childinvolves accepting that the child has committed a delinquent act and accepting that the child is a delinquent child.State v. Doe, 1978-NMCA-025, 91 N.M. 506, 576 P.2d 1137.\n\nObligation to advise of rights.— Although the court has a statutory obligation to advise children before it of their rights under the Children's Code and other laws at each separate appearance, that obligation must be read in light of the legislative purposes expressed in the code, and since the child did not claim any prejudice nor claim that he was not otherwise advised by his attorney of his constitutional or other legal rights, the appellate court would not reverse a commitment order for failure of the trial court to advise the child of his rights.In re Doe, 1975-NMCA-124, 88 N.M. 481, 542 P.2d 61.\n\nDemand requirement for jury trial is ineffective to change constitutional rightto a jury trial.State v. Doe, 1980-NMCA-091, 94 N.M. 637, 614 P.2d 1086 (decided under prior law).\n\nFailure to make jury demand— The children's court erred in concluding that a child was not entitled to a jury trial when he failed to make a timely jury demand as provided in 10-228A NMRA (now 10-245 NMRA); the rule can do no more than encourage a counseled decision at an early stage of the proceedings.State v. Eric M., 1996-NMSC-056, 122 N.M. 436, 925 P.2d 1198.\n\nChild's right to waive jury trial.— The state has no right grounded in either state statute, court rule, or the state constitution to impose a right of concurrence on the right of a child to waive his jury trial.In re Christopher K., 1999-NMCA-157, 128 N.M. 406, 993 P.2d 120.\n\nWaiver of right must be done knowingly.— Waiver of a right created by the constitution, a statute or a court-promulgated rule must be done intelligently and knowingly if the right is to be denied the one claiming it.State ex rel. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Perlman, 1981-NMCA-076, 96 N.M. 779, 635 P.2d 588.\n\nExpress waiver of right to jury trial required.— Where a child has a right to a trial by jury, such right may be waived, but only by an express waiver.State v. Doe, 1980-NMCA-091, 94 N.M. 637, 614 P.2d 1086, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 675, 615 P.2d 992.\n\nPhrase \"when the offense alleged would be triable by jury if committed by an adult\"means a district court offense. A child charged with a petty misdemeanor which would have been triable by jury in the magistrate court if committed by an adult was not entitled to jury trial.State v. Doe, 1977-NMCA-092, 90 N.M. 776, 568 P.2d 612, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 3, 569 P.2d 413.\n\nSame treatment as adult.— Prior to the adoption of the state's first juvenile law in 1917, a minor charged with having committed a criminal offense was handled no differently than an adult. Under the provisions of N.M. Const., art. II, § 12, which reads in part, \"the right of trial by jury as it has heretofore existed shall be secured to all and remain inviolate,\" he would have been entitled to have his guilt determined by a jury before he could have been imprisoned.Peyton v. Nord, 1968-NMSC-027, 78 N.M. 717, 437 P.2d 716.\n\nNo imprisonment without jury.— At the time of the adoption of the state constitution, a juvenile could not have been imprisoned without a trial by jury. This being true, no change in terminology or procedure may be invoked whereby incarceration could be accomplished in a manner which involved denial of the right to jury trial.Peyton v. Nord, 1968-NMSC-027, 78 N.M. 717, 437 P.2d 716.\n\nDriving under the influence and violating Liquor Control Act.— Child who was charged with driving under the influence and violation of the Liquor Control Act was entitled to a jury trial, since an adult would have been entitled to a jury trial if facing two charges with the same penalties as the offenses on which the child was tried, and since the maximum possible aggregate sentence exceeded six months.State v. Benjamin C., 1989-NMCA-075, 109 N.M. 67, 781 P.2d 795, cert denied, 109 N.M. 54, 781 P.2d 782.\n\nState's burden of proof in rebutting the presumption of inadmissibility in 32A-2-14F NMSA 1978.— To overcome the presumption of inadmissibility in 32A-2-14F NMSA 1978, the state must prove by clear and convincing evidence that at the time the thirteen or fourteen-year-old child made his or her statement to a person in a position of authority, the child had the maturity to understand his or her constitutional and statutory rights and the force of will to invoke such rights. In order to obtain the clear and convincing evidence needed to rebut the presumption of inadmissibility, the interrogator who is in a position of authority must first adequately advise the thirteen or fourteen-year-old child of his or her Miranda and statutory rights and then invite the child to explain, on the record, his or her actual comprehension and appreciation of each Miranda warning.State v. DeAngelo M., 2015-NMSC-033,aff'g on other grounds2015-NMCA-019.\n\nWhere thirteen-year-old child, charged with murder, residential burglary, tampering with evidence, and larceny, was subjected to a custodial interrogation by three law enforcement officers, during which child made inculpatory statements regarding a burglary that connected child to a murder, the trial court erred in denying child's motion to suppress the statements where the officers failed to advise child of his Miranda and statutory rights in a clear and intelligible manner and where it was not clear from the record that child fully comprehended and appreciated his constitutional and statutory rights. Moreover, the fact that child continued to answer questions after unambiguously asserting his right to remain silent provided additional evidence that child did not possess either the maturity to understand his rights or the force of will to assert those rights. The state did not meet its burden of rebutting the presumption of inadmissibility under 32A-2-14F NMSA 1978.State v. DeAngelo M., 2015-NMSC-033,aff'g on other grounds2015-NMCA-019.\n\nJury size for juvenile disposition.— Whether the child is entitled to a twelve-member jury is not determined by the charges, but by the state's decision to invoke an adult sentence; a child is entitled to a six-member jury unless subject to an adult sentence.State v. DeAngelo M., 2015-NMCA-019, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-002.\n\nWhere the state's petition for delinquency terms the child as a \"delinquent child\" and describes the offenses as \"delinquent acts\", and where the state did not seek an adult sentence, the child was not entitled to a twelve-member jury.State v. DeAngelo M., 2015-NMCA-019, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-002.\n\nFelony evidence not charged in petition sustains finding.— Evidence of \"an act\" constituting a felony, in the absence of contrary evidence, sustains a finding that a child is in need of care or rehabilitation, whether or not the felony act was charged in the petition.State v. Doe, 1979-NMCA-021, 93 N.M. 206, 598 P.2d 1166.\n\nConviction of crime prerequisite to determination of delinquency.— It is a fundamental right of a party to be convicted of a crime, which is a necessary prerequisite to a determination of delinquency, based upon evidence of the elements of the crime, and in a prosecution for a violation of Section 30-31-23 NMSA 1978, the state must prove that the respondents had knowledge of the presence and character of the item possessed; a degree of furtiveness on the parts of juvenile respondents, in doing their smoking and passing a pipe around between buildings while changing classes, in light of a school regulation prohibiting the smoking of tobacco, was not conduct sufficient to infer that the smokers knew the character of the substance they were using.Doe v. State, 1975-NMCA-108, 88 N.M. 347, 540 P.2d 827, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nCertified statement on appeal supports conclusion of delinquency.— Since the children's court judge's original findings did not support delinquency, but a certified statement by him on appeal did contain findings that supported the judgment, the findings were sufficient to support the conclusion that the child was a delinquent.State v. Doe, 1977-NMCA-078, 91 N.M. 92, 570 P.2d 923.\n\nTwo aspects to determination of delinquency.— There are two aspects to the determination that a child is a delinquent child - the act which he committed and the need for care or rehabilitation.State v. Doe, 1977-NMCA-023, 90 N.M. 249, 561 P.2d 948 (decided under prior law).\n\nOn a petition alleging delinquency, the adjudicatory proceedings involve two aspects: (1) whether the child committed the delinquent act, and (2) whether the child is in need of care or rehabilitation.State v. Doe, 1979-NMCA-021, 93 N.M. 206, 598 P.2d 1166 (decided under prior law).\n\nStandard for admissibility of evidence in adjudicatory phases of hearing is clearly differentfrom that in the dispositional phase of the hearing.Doe v. State, 1978-NMSC-068, 92 N.M. 74, 582 P.2d 1287.\n\nUse of predisposition report held constitutionally impermissible.— When a predisposition report received by a judge in a juvenile delinquency case is composed primarily of hearsay evidence which would be clearly incompetent in either of the adjudicatory phases of the proceedings, and it was not shown to be \"competent, material and relevant in nature,\" then to use such hearsay and untested evidence to determine delinquency is constitutionally impermissible as a denial of the child's constitutional right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him.Doe v. State, 1978-NMSC-068, 92 N.M. 74, 582 P.2d 1287.\n\nEvidence supporting need for rehabilitation.— Since the evidence showed that a child made an unauthorized entry of the residence of a victim at night with the intent to commit the offense of criminal sexual penetration (which is the third-degree felony of burglary) and that after entering he attempted to commit, at the least, the crime of criminal sexual penetration in the third degree (a fourth-degree felony), and there was no evidence to the contrary, the evidence of either of the felonies sustains the finding that the child is in need of care and rehabilitation.State v. Doe, 1979-NMCA-021, 93 N.M. 206, 598 P.2d 1166 (decided under prior law).\n\nNo abuse of discretion in order for committal.— Court did not abuse its discretion in ordering that a child convicted of involuntary manslaughter be committed to the custody of the youth authority (now children, youth and families departments) as there was evidence in the record to support the determination that the child had committed a delinquent act and that the child was in need of care and rehabilitation.State v. Cody R., 1991-NMCA-127, 113 N.M. 140, 823 P.2d 940, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 23, 821 P.2d 1060 (decided under prior law).\n\nNo authority to order evaluation although child committed delinquent acts.— Although a child was found to have committed delinquent acts, there was no finding that the child was in need of care or rehabilitation, or a finding that the child was a delinquent child, and thus the children's court lacked authority to order a diagnostic evaluation.State v. Doe, 1977-NMCA-023, 90 N.M. 249, 561 P.2d 948 (decided under prior law).\n\nChild's right to address court prior to sentencing.— A child has the right to address the children's court before disposition; the children's court should offer a child the opportunity to address the court before pronouncing sentence.State v. Ricky G., 1990-NMCA-101, 110 N.M. 646, 798 P.2d 596.\n\nConditions necessary to place child on probation.— The children's court can place a delinquent child on probation without finding that the child is in need of care and rehabilitation. Further, the court has discretion regarding whether to dismiss a case or place a child on probation when it has specifically found that the child is not in need of care and rehabilitation.State v. Michael R., 1988-NMCA-087, 107 N.M. 794, 765 P.2d 767 (decided under prior law).\n\nErroneous findings held not to require reversal.— Since there were findings that supported the judgment and findings that did not support the judgment, the erroneous findings did not require a reversal; they were unnecessary for a decision in this case.State v. Doe, 1977-NMCA-078, 91 N.M. 92, 570 P.2d 923.\n\nTraffic offenses not public hearings.— Hearings for those traffic offenses which are delinquent acts, which come exclusively under the jurisdiction of the children's court, are expressly not public hearings. 1972 Op.

After a petition has been filed and either a finding with respect to the allegations of the petition has been made or a notice of intent to admit the allegations of the petition has been filed, the court may direct that a predisposition study and report to the court be made in writing by the department or an appropriate agency designated by the court concerning the child, the family of the child, the environment of the child and any other matters relevant to the need for treatment or to appropriate disposition of the case. The following predisposition reports shall be provided to the parties and the court five days before actual disposition or sentencing:\n\n(1) the adult probation and parole division of the corrections department shall prepare a predisposition report for a serious youthful offender;\n\n(2) the department shall prepare a predisposition report for a serious youthful offender who is convicted of an offense other than first degree murder;\n\n(3) the department shall prepare a predisposition report for a youthful offender concerning the youthful offender's amenability to treatment and if:\n\n(a) the court determines that a juvenile disposition is appropriate, the department shall prepare a subsequent predisposition report; or\n\n(b) the court makes the findings necessary to impose an adult sentence pursuant to Section 32A-2-20 NMSA 1978, the adult probation and parole division of the corrections department shall prepare a subsequent predisposition report; and\n\n(4) the department shall prepare a predisposition report for a delinquent offender, upon the court's request.\n\nB. Where there are indications that the child may have a mental disorder or developmental disability, the court, on motion by the children's court attorney or that of counsel for the child, may order the child to be examined at a suitable place by a physician or psychiatrist, a licensed psychologist, a licensed professional clinical counselor or a licensed independent social worker prior to a hearing on the merits of the petition. An examination made prior to the hearing or as a part of the predisposition study and report shall be conducted on an outpatient basis, unless the court finds that placement in a hospital or other appropriate facility is necessary.\n\nC. The court, after a hearing, may order examination by a physician or psychiatrist, a licensed psychologist or a licensed professional clinical counselor or a licensed independent social worker of a parent or custodian whose ability to care for or supervise a child is an issue before the court.\n\nD. The court may order that a child adjudicated as a delinquent child be administered a predispositional evaluation by a professional designated by the department for purposes of diagnosis, with direction that the court be given a report indicating what disposition appears most suitable when the interests of the child and the public are considered. The evaluation shall be completed within fifteen days of the court's order and the preference shall be for performing the evaluation in the child's community.\n\nE. If a child is detained for purposes of performing a predispositional evaluation, it shall be completed within fifteen days and in no event shall a child be detained for more than fifteen days within a three-hundred-sixty-five-day period for a predispositional evaluation, unless for good cause shown.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-17, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 46; 1995, ch. 206, § 12; 2005, ch. 189, § 15; 2009, ch. 239, § 19.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection B, after \"place by a physician\", added \"or psychiatrist\" and after \"licensed psychologist\", added \"a license professional clinical counselor\"; in Subsection C, after \"examination by a physician\", added \"or psychiatrist\"; and after \"psychologist or a licensed\", added \"professional clinical counselor or a licensed\"; in Subsection D, after \"delinquent child be\", deleted \"transferred to the facility designated by the secretary of the department for a period of not more than fifteen days within a three hundred sixty-five day time period\"; added \"administered a predispositional evaluation by a professional designated by the department\"; and added the last sentence; deleted former Subsection E, which provided for a determination of the time when a child who was committed was to be released; and added Subsection E.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, changed \"offenders\" to the singular case in Subsection A and changed mental disorder and development disability from a state of being to a condition in Subsection B.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, inserted \"concerning the youthful offender's amenability to treatment and if\" in Paragraph (3) of Subsection A and added Subparagraphs A(3)(a) and A(3)(b).\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-32 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nProcedure to determine amenability to treatment.— The trial court is required to request a report from the children, youth and families department on a youthful offender's amenability to treatment and if the youthful offender is found not to be amenable to treatment, the trial court is required to request a subsequent predisposition report from the department of corrections and conduct a separate sentencing hearing.State v.

      "text": "A. The court shall enter a judgment setting forth the court's findings and disposition in the proceeding. A judgment in proceedings on a petition under the Delinquency Act resulting in a juvenile disposition shall not be deemed a conviction of crime nor shall it impose any civil disabilities ordinarily resulting from conviction of a crime nor shall it operate to disqualify the child in any civil service application or appointment. The juvenile disposition of a child and any evidence given in a hearing in court shall not be admissible as evidence against the child in any case or proceeding in any other tribunal whether before or after reaching the age of majority, except in sentencing proceedings after conviction of a felony and then only for the purpose of a presentence study and report.\n\nB. If a judgment resulting from a youthful offender or serious youthful offender proceeding under the Delinquency Act results in an adult sentence, a record of the judgment shall be admissible in any other case or proceeding in any other court involving the youthful offender or serious youthful offender.\n\nC. If a judgment on a proceeding under the Delinquency Act results in an adult sentence, the determination of guilt at trial becomes a conviction for purposes of the Criminal Code [30-1-1 NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-18, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 47; 1996, ch. 85, § 3.\n\nThe 1996 amendment,effective July 1, 1996, designated the existing language as Subsections A and C, and added Subsection B.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-33 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nApplicability of criminal appellate procedure does not make children's court matters criminal proceedings.— The applicability of appellate procedure for criminal cases to appeals from judgments of the children's court, where the child was alleged to be delinquent or in need of supervision, does not change the fact that children's court matters are not criminal proceedings.Health & Soc.

Commitments are subject to limitations and modifications set forth in Section 32A-2-23 NMSA 1978. The types of commitments include:\n\n(a) a short-term commitment of one year in a facility for the care and rehabilitation of adjudicated delinquent children.

When the child is an Indian child, the Indian child's cultural needs shall be considered in the dispositional judgment and reasonable access to cultural practices and traditional treatment shall be provided.\n\nD. A child found to be delinquent shall not be committed or transferred to a penal institution or other facility used for the execution of sentences of persons convicted of crimes.\n\nE. Whenever the court vests legal custody in an agency, institution or department, it shall transmit with the dispositional judgment copies of the clinical reports, predisposition study and report and other information it has pertinent to the care and treatment of the child.\n\nF. Prior to any child being placed in the custody of the department, the department shall be provided with reasonable oral or written notification and an opportunity to be heard.\n\nG. In addition to any other disposition pursuant to Subsection B of this section, the court may make an abuse or neglect report for investigation and proceedings as provided for in the Abuse and Neglect Act [Chapter 32A, Article 4 NMSA 1978]. The report may be made to a local law enforcement agency, the department or a tribal law enforcement or social service agency for an Indian child residing in Indian country.\n\nH. In addition to any other disposition pursuant to this section or any other penalty provided by law, if a child who is fifteen years of age or older is adjudicated delinquent on the basis of Paragraph (2), (3) or (4) of Subsection A of Section 32A-2-3 NMSA 1978, the child's driving privileges may be denied or the child's driver's license may be revoked for a period of ninety days. For a second or a subsequent adjudication, the child's driving privileges may be denied or the child's driver's license revoked for a period of one year. Within twenty-four hours of the dispositional judgment, the court may send to the motor vehicle division of the taxation and revenue department the order adjudicating delinquency. Upon receipt of an order from the court adjudicating delinquency, the director of the motor vehicle division of the taxation and revenue department may revoke or deny the delinquent's driver's license or driving privileges. Nothing in this section may prohibit the delinquent from applying for a limited driving privilege pursuant to Section 66-5-35 NMSA 1978 or an ignition interlock license pursuant to the Ignition Interlock Licensing Act [66-5-501 to 66-5-504 NMSA 1978], and nothing in this section precludes the delinquent's participation in an appropriate educational, counseling or rehabilitation program.\n\nI. In addition to any other disposition pursuant to this section or any other penalty provided by law, when a child is adjudicated delinquent on the basis of Paragraph (6) of Subsection A of Section 32A-2-3 NMSA 1978, the child shall perform the mandatory community service set forth in Section 30-15-1.1 NMSA 1978.

      "text": "A. The court has the discretion to invoke either an adult sentence or juvenile sanctions on a youthful offender. The children's court attorney shall file a notice of intent to invoke an adult sentence within ten working days of the filing of the petition; provided that the court may extend the time for filing of the notice of intent to invoke an adult sentence, for good cause shown, prior to the adjudicatory hearing. A preliminary hearing by the court or a hearing before a grand jury shall be held, within ten days after the filing of the intent to invoke an adult sentence, to determine whether probable cause exists to support the allegations contained in the petition.\n\nB. If the children's court attorney has filed a notice of intent to invoke an adult sentence and the child is adjudicated as a youthful offender, the court shall make the following findings in order to invoke an adult sentence:\n\n(1) the child is not amenable to treatment or rehabilitation as a child in available facilities; and\n\n(2) the child is not eligible for commitment to an institution for children with developmental disabilities or mental disorders.\n\nC. In making the findings set forth in Subsection B of this section, the judge shall consider the following factors:\n\n(1) the seriousness of the alleged offense;\n\n(2) whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated or willful manner;\n\n(3) whether a firearm was used to commit the alleged offense;\n\n(4) whether the alleged offense was against persons or against property, greater weight being given to offenses against persons, especially if personal injury resulted;\n\n(5) the maturity of the child as determined by consideration of the child's home, environmental situation, social and emotional health, pattern of living, brain development, trauma history and disability;\n\n(6) the record and previous history of the child;\n\n(7) the prospects for adequate protection of the public and the likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the child by the use of procedures, services and facilities currently available; and\n\n(8) any other relevant factor, provided that factor is stated on the record.\n\nD. If a child has previously been sentenced as an adult pursuant to the provisions of this section, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the child is not amenable to treatment or rehabilitation as a child in available facilities.\n\nE. If the court invokes an adult sentence, the court may sentence the child to less than, but shall not exceed, the mandatory adult sentence. A youthful offender given an adult sentence shall be treated as an adult offender and shall be transferred to the legal custody of an agency responsible for incarceration of persons sentenced to adult sentences. This transfer terminates the jurisdiction of the court over the child with respect to the delinquent acts alleged in the petition. A child given an adult sentence shall not be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole.\n\nF. If a juvenile disposition is appropriate, the court shall follow the provisions set forth in Section 32A-2-19 NMSA 1978. A youthful offender may be subject to extended commitment in the care of the department until the age of twenty-one, pursuant to the provisions of Section 32A-2-23 NMSA 1978.\n\nG. A child fourteen years of age or older, charged with first degree murder, but not convicted of first degree murder and found to have committed a youthful offender offense as set forth in Subsection J of Section 32A-2-3 NMSA 1978, is subject to the dispositions set forth in this section.\n\nH. A child fourteen years of age or older charged with first degree murder, but found to have committed a delinquent act that is neither first degree murder nor a youthful offender offense as set forth in Subsection J of Section 32A-2-3 NMSA 1978, shall be adjudicated as a delinquent subject to the dispositions set forth in Section 32A-2-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-20, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 49; 1995, ch. 206, § 14; 1996, ch. 85, § 5; 2003, ch. 225, § 11; 2005, ch. 189, § 17; 2009, ch. 239, § 21; 2023, ch. 24, § 4.\n\nCross references.— For escape from custody of the children, youth and families department,see30-22-11.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor aggravated escape from the custody of the children, youth and families department,see30-22-11.2 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, prohibited the imposition of a sentence of life without the possibility of release or parole on a child given an adult sentence; and in Subsection E, after \"delinquent acts alleged in the petition\", added \"A child given an adult sentence shall not be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole.\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2023, ch. 24, § 5 provided that the provisions of Laws 2023, ch. 24 apply retroactively to all offenders currently serving an adult sentence for an offense committed as a child.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Paragraph (5) of Subsection C, at the beginning of the sentence, before \"maturity\", deleted \"sophistication and\"; after \"environmental situation\", deleted \"emotional attitude and\" and added \"social and emotional health\"; and after \"pattern of living\", added \"brain development, trauma history and disability\".\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, in Subsection G, provided that a child fourteen years of age or older, charged with first degree murder, but not convicted of first degree murder and found to have committed a youthful offender offence is subject to the dispositions of this section; and added Subsection H, which provided that a child fourteen years of age or older charged with first degree murder, but found to have committed a delinquent act that is not first degree murder or a youthful offender offence shall be adjudicated as a delinquent subject to the dispositions of Section 32A-2-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, added present Subsection D and redesignated Subsections D to F as Subsections E to G.\n\nThe 1996 amendment,effective July 1, 1996, added Paragraph C(3) and redesignated the following paragraphs accordingly, and substituted \"fourteen to eighteen\" for \"sixteen or seventeen\" in Subsection F.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, in Subsection A, substituted \"court\" for \"children's court judge\", substituted \"shall\" for \"must\" preceding \"file a notice\", and deleted \"children's\" preceding \"court\" in the last sentence; in Paragraph (5) of Subsection C, substituted \"child\" for \"juvenile\"; in Subsection D, substituted \"court\" for \"judge\" and made a related change; and in Subsection E, substituted \"court\" for \"judge\" and \"32A-2-19\" for \"32-2-19\" in the first sentence and \"32A-2-23\" for \"32-2-23\" at the end.\n\nUntimely preliminary hearing.— Where a preliminary hearing was held twenty-four days after the state filed notice of intent to charge the child as a youthful offender, the court did not commit reversible error in denying the child's motion to dismiss, because neither Rule 10-213 NMRA nor Section 32A-2-20 NMSA 1978 provides a remedy for a violation of the time limits for holding a preliminary hearing.State v. Leticia T., 2012-NMCA-050, 278 P.3d 553,rev'd, 2014-NMSC-020.\n\nJury determination not required.— Federal law does not require that a juvenile's amenability to treatment and eligibility for mental health commitment be determined by a jury.Gonzales v. Tafoya, 515 F.3d 1097 (10th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 890, 129 S. Ct. 211, 172 L. Ed . 2d 156 (2008).\n\nStandard of proof of amenability.— Federal law does not clearly require the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof at the amenability hearing, and the court may apply the less exacting (but still substantial) clear-and-convincing standard of proof in assessing the evidence of amenability to treatment or rehabilitation.Gonzales v. Tafoya, 515 F.3d 1097 (10th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 890, 129 S. Ct. 211, 172 L. Ed. 2d 156 (2008).\n\nAccessory to criminal sexual penetration— The legislature intended that juveniles adjudicated to be accessories to criminal sexual penetration be punished in the same way as juveniles adjudicated to have committed CSP. Juveniles who are accessories to criminal sexual penetration are youthful offenders. Section 32A-2-20 NMSA 1978 gives the court discretion whether to impose a juvenile sanction or, if certain requirements are met, an adult sentence.State v. Perez, 2002-NMCA-040, 132 N.M. 84, 44 P.3d 530, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 83, 44 P.3d 529.\n\nAmenability hearing is a condition precedent for exercising adult sentencing authority in youthful offender cases.— Only serious youthful offenders charged with first-degree murder can be tried in district court and automatically sentenced as adults if convicted. All others remain in the juvenile system until after adjudication and may be sentenced as adults only after an amenability hearing.State v. Jones, 2010-NMSC-012, 148 N.M. 1, 229 P.3d 474.\n\nThe right to an amenability hearing cannot be waived.State v. Jones, 2010-NMSC-012, 148 N.M. 1, 229 P.3d 474.\n\nFirst-degree murder charges voluntarily dismissed by the state.— If the state voluntarily dismisses a first-degree murder charge against defendant and substitutes a youthful offender offense, then from the moment the state drops the first-degree murder charge, defendant is a child who is entitled to the full range of protections afforded by the Delinquency Act and the court lacks authority to sentence defendant as an adult without first determining defendant's amenability to treatment or rehabilitation as a juvenile.State v. Jones, 2010-NMSC-012, 148 N.M. 1, 229 P.3d 474.\n\nWhere defendant, who was age 17, was originally charged as a serious youthful offender with first-degree murder of an infant child; the state subsequently voluntarily dismissed the first-degree murder charge against defendant after recognizing that the state lacked the evidence to prove the crime and substituted the charge of child abuse resulting in death; defendant pled guilty to child abuse resulting in death, agreed to an adult disposition, and received an adult sentence of 18 years imprisonment; and in sentencing defendant, the district court did not first determine whether defendant was amenable to treatment or rehabilitation as a juvenile, defendant was a youthful offender when defendant entered into the plea agreement and the court erred in sentencing defendant as a adult without first determining defendant's amenability to treatment or rehabilitation as a juvenile.State v. Jones, 2010-NMSC-012, 148 N.M. 1, 229 P.3d 474.\n\nAppeal of an amenability determination is nonwaivable.— A challenge to an amenability determination presents a challenge to the jurisdiction of the district court to impose an adult sentence, and it may be raised on appeal notwithstanding the entry of a valid guilty plea and appellate waiver.State v. Rodriguez, 2023-NMSC-004,rev'gA-1-CA-37324, mem. op. (N.M. Ct. App. Nov. 27, 2019) (nonprecedential).\n\nYouthful offender may appeal amenability determination, notwithstanding guilty plea and appellate waiver.— Where defendant pleaded guilty to felony offenses committed when he was sixteen years old under a plea and disposition agreement, and following an amenability hearing, the district court imposed an adult sentence, and where defendant appealed the amenability determination, and on its own motion, the Court of Appeals held that under the plea and disposition agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal, the Court of Appeals erred in its determination that defendant waived his right to appeal, because a challenge to an amenability determination presents a jurisdictional argument that may be raised on appeal notwithstanding the entry of a valid guilty plea and appellate waiver. A juvenile's guilty plea may neither waive the right to an amenability determination, nor can a juvenile waive the right to appeal the outcome of an amenability determination.State v. Rodriguez, 2023-NMSC-004,rev'gA-1-CA-37324, mem. op. (N.M. Ct. App. Nov. 27, 2019) (nonprecedential).\n\nRight to jury trial does not apply to amenability determinations.— A determination of amenability to treatment or rehabilitation of a youthful offender pursuant to Section 32A-2-20 NMSA 1978 is not within the scope of the rule ofApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed.2d 435 (2000), and the sixth amendment's guarantee of a jury trial does not apply to amenability proceedings.State v. Rudy B., 2010-NMSC-045, 149 N.M. 22, 243 P.3d 726,overruling2009-NMCA-104, 147 N.M. 45, 216 P.3d 810.\n\nSubsections B and C of Section 32A-2-20 NMSA 1978 are facially unconstitutional under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, because they require the trial court, not a jury, to find the additional facts necessary to impose an adult sentence.State v. Rudy B., 2009-NMCA-104, 147 N.M. 45, 216 P.3d 810, cert. granted, 2009-NMCERT-009,overrulingState v. Gonzales, 2001-NMCA-025, 130 N.M. 341, 24 P.3d 776,overruled byState v. Rudy B., 2010-NMSC-045, 149 N.M. 22, 243 P.3d 726.\n\nAmenability to treatment.— Where defendant, who was a child offender under the juvenile system, pled guilty to second degree murder; defendant admitted that after a fight between the victim and defendant's cousin had ended, defendant went to defendant's car, opened the trunk, removed a sawed-off shotgun, loaded the shotgun and fired the shotgun at the victim; at the time the victim was shot, the victim was facing defendant with the victim's hands in the air; defendant's prior criminal history involved a firearm; defendant was married subsequent to the shooting; and defendant suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder because of the incident, the evidence was sufficient to support the court's determination that defendant was not amenable to treatment.State v. Trujillo, 2009-NMCA-128, 147 N.M. 334, 222 P.3d 1040, cert. quashed, 2010-NMCERT-011, 150 N.M. 490, 262 P.3d 1143.\n\nAmenability determination not supported by substantial evidence.— Where child pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder and three counts of intentional child abuse resulting in death for shooting and killing his father, mother, and three younger siblings, and where the district court found that the state failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that child is not amenable to treatment or rehabilitation as a child in available facilities, the district court abused its discretion in committing child to the custody of the New Mexico children, youth and families department until child's twenty-first birthday, because the district court failed to consider and make findings on all the statutorily required factors of 32A-2-20(C) NMSA 1978, based its findings in the amendability order on a misapprehension of the law, and misunderstood, and then arbitrarily disregarded, the uncontradicted testimony of the experts who testified specifically about child's prospects for rehabilitation by the age of twenty-one.State v. Nehemiah G., 2018-NMCA-034, cert. denied.\n\nAmenability to treatment is a jury question.— The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment requires that the determination of whether an offender is amenable to treatment or rehabilitation or is eligible for commitment to an institution as a condition to imposing an adult sentence be made by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Rudy B., 2009-NMCA-104, 147 N.M. 45, 216 P.3d 810, cert. granted, 2009-NMCERT-009,overrulingState v. Gonzales, 2001-NMCA-025, 130 N.M. 341, 24 P.3d 776,overruled byState v. Rudy B., 2010-NMSC-045, 149 N.M. 22, 243 P.3d 726.\n\nConstitutionality.— This section is not arbitrary or discriminatory and adequately provides for the elemental due process rights of a child under the constitution.State v. Ernesto M., 1996-NMCA-039, 121 N.M. 562, 915 P.2d 318, cert denied, 121 N.M. 444, 913 P.2d 251.\n\nEntitlement to dispositional hearing.— No matter what kind of youthful offender category a child falls under, that child is entitled to a dispositional hearing to determine whether he or she will be subject to juvenile sanctions or an adult sentence.State v. Stephen F., 2005-NMCA-048, 137 N.M. 409, 112 P.3d 270,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2006-NMSC-030, 140 N.M. 24, 139 P.3d 184.\n\nMeaning of \"offense less than first-degree murder.\"— Had the legislature intended to limit the scope of Subsection G of this section to lesser-included offenses of first-degree murder, it could have expressed that intent by using the phrase \"lesser-included offense\". Instead, the legislature meant Subsection G to apply to all crimes other than first-degree murder, which are \"lesser crimes\" in the sense that they carry lesser penalties than life imprisonment or death.State v. Muniz, 2003-NMSC-021, 134 N.M. 152, 74 P.3d 86, superseded by statute,State v. Jones, 2010-NMSC-012, 148 N.M. 1, 229 P.3d 474.\n\nSentencing as adult for unlisted crime.— A juvenile who is adjudicated for any of the offenses listed under Section 32A-2-3I NMSA 1978 (now Section 32A-2-3J NMSA) may be subject to adult sanctions under this section for any other offense in the same case.State v. Montano, 1995-NMCA-065, 120 N.M. 218, 900 P.2d 967, cert. denied, 120 N.M. 68, 898 P.2d 120.\n\nDistrict court had authority to impose an adult sentence on a juvenile who was originally charged as a serious youthful offender, but who subsequently pled guilty only to offenses that would not qualify for an adult sentence if brought independently.State v. Muniz, 2003-NMSC-021, 134 N.M. 152, 74 P.3d 86, superseded by statute,State v. Jones, 2010-NMSC-012, 148 N.M. 1, 229 P.3d 474.\n\nSerious youthful offender not to be treated as delinquent child.— A serious youthful offender, upon conviction for a lesser crime than first-degree murder, should always be treated as a youthful offender, even when convicted of a crime that would otherwise categorize the child as a delinquent child.State v. Muniz, 2003-NMSC-021, 134 N.M. 152, 74 P.3d 86, superseded by statute,State v. Jones, 2010-NMSC-012, 148 N.M. 1, 229 P.3d 474.\n\nDisposition of a youthful offender.— Children who are not convicted of first-degree murder and who appear to be amenable to rehabilitation have a basic and essential right not to be sentenced as adults unless the trial court fulfills the requirements of Subsections B and C of this section.State v. Hunter, 2001-NMCA-078, 131 N.M. 76, 33 P.3d 296.\n\nSentencing for non-capital felonies.— The basic sentences prescribed by Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978 are \"mandatory\" within the meaning of Subsection D of this section, while the alterations in the basic sentences allowed by Section 31-18-15.1 NMSA 1978 are discretionary and, therefore, circumscribed by the Children's Code (Section 32A-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.); thus, the maximum sentence that may be imposed upon a youthful offender convicted of a non-capital felony is the basic sentence, plus, if applicable, the enhancements prescribed by Sections 31-18-16 and 31-18-16.1 NMSA 1978 (now repealed).State v. Guerra, 2001-NMCA-031, 130 N.M. 302, 24 P.3d 334, cert. denied,sub nom. State v. Ruby G., 130 N.M. 459, 26 P.3d 103.\n\nStandard of proof applied to findings.— Neither the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution nor N.M. const. art. 11, § 4 require that findings under Subsection B be made by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Gonzales, 2001-NMCA-025, 130 N.M. 341, 24 P.3d 776,overruled byState v. Rudy B., 2009-NMCA-104, 147 N.M. 45, 216 P.3d 810.\n\nWeighing of factors.— Determination of the children's court judge that the order of enumeration of the factors set forth in this section were to be read in descending order of importance, and the application by the court of such methodology in his findings, did not prejudice the defendant child.State v. Ernesto M., 1996-NMCA-039, 121 N.M. 562, 915 P.2d 318, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 444, 913 P.2d 251.\n\nAmenability to treatment.— Even though the testimony of the experts was conflicting, the decision of the children's court judge that the defendant child was not amenable to treatment was supported by substantial evidence.State v. Ernesto M., 1996-NMCA-039, 121 N.M. 562, 915 P.2d 318, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 444, 913 P.2d 251.\n\nEvery factor listed in Subsection C provides important information about the child and the child's prospects for rehabilitation.State v. Gonzales, 2001-NMCA-025, 130 N.M. 341, 24 P.3d 776,overruled byState v. Rudy B., 2009-NMCA-104, 147 N.M. 45, 216 P.3d 810.\n\nSection 31-18-15.3(F) NMSA 1978 gives the district court the discretion to impose an adult sentence as indicated in this section based on a finding that a child is not amenable to treatment. If the district court finds the child is amenable to treatment, then the district court should impose a juvenile disposition in accordance with Section 32A-2-19 NMSA 1978.State v. Muniz, 2003-NMSC-021, 134 N.M. 152, 74 P.3d 86, superseded by statute as stated inState v. Jones, 2010-NMSC-012, 148 N.M. 1, 229 P.3d 474..\n\nEligibility for commitment.— In deciding whether defendant was eligible for commitment, the trial court was required to consider the seven factors listed in Subsection C. The court was not required to find eligibility based on facts that an expert deemed the child eligible for commitment under Section 32A-6-13I NMSA 1978, or that a treatment facility was willing and able to accept the child.State v. Gonzales, 2001-NMCA-025, 130 N.M. 341, 24 P.3d 776,overruled byState v. Rudy B., 2009-NMCA-104, 147 N.M. 45, 216 P.3d 810.\n\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendant \"is not amenable to treatment or rehabilitation as a child in available facilities,\" and that he is not likely to be rehabilitated in \"facilities currently available.\"State v. Todisco, 2000-NMCA-064, 129 N.M. 310, 6 P.3d 1032, cert. quashed, 132 N.M. 484, 51 P.3d 527 (2002).\n\nOffense against person or property.— Sentencing of 17-year-old defendant as an adult upon conviction for shooting into a vehicle causing great bodily harm and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon was warranted based on consideration of the factors listed in this section.State v. Sosa, 1997-NMSC-032, 123 N.M. 564, 943 P.2d 1017abrogated by State v. Porter, 2020-NMSC-020.\n\nSentence not cruel and unusual punishment.— Sentencing a 17-year-old child as an adult to a 30-year term for rape and other crimes he admitted to committing was not cruel and unusual punishment.State v. Ernesto M., 1996-NMCA-039, 121 N.M. 562, 915 P.2d 318, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 444, 913 P.2d 251.\n\nStandard of review.— Because the trial court used the clear and convincing standard in its finding that defendant was not amenable to treatment as a juvenile or eligible for commitment, the court of appeals evaluated whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, the trial court could have found that the clear and convincing standard was met.State v. Gonzales, 2001-NMCA-025, 130 N.M. 341, 24 P.3d 776,overruled byState v. Rudy B., 2009-NMCA-104, 147 N.M. 45, 216 P.3d 810.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"State v.

If in a hearing at any stage of a proceeding on a delinquency petition the evidence indicates that the child has or may have a mental disorder or developmental disability, the court may:\n\n(1) order the child detained if appropriate under the criteria established pursuant to the provisions of the Delinquency Act; and\n\n(2) initiate proceedings for the involuntary placement of the child as a minor with a mental disorder or developmental disability pursuant to the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act [32A-6A-1 to 32A-6A-30 NMSA 1978].\n\nB.

If a child is committed to a psychiatric hospital for treatment or habilitation and in the event that the department should be required to pay more than four hundred dollars ($400) per day because of the individualized treatment plan, the annual costs over four hundred dollars ($400) per child per day will be reported annually by the department to the legislative finance committee.\n\nD.

When a child in departmental custody needs involuntary placement for residential mental health or developmental disability services as a result of a mental disorder or developmental disability, the department shall request the children's court attorney to petition for that child's placement pursuant to the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act.\n\nF. A child subject to the provisions of the Delinquency Act who receives treatment in a residential treatment or habilitation program shall enjoy all the substantive and procedural rights set forth in the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act.\n\nG. A child's competency to stand trial or participate in his own defense may be raised by a party at any time during a proceeding. If the child has been accused of an act that would be considered a misdemeanor if the child were an adult and the child is found to be incompetent to stand trial, the court shall dismiss the petition with prejudice and may recommend that the children's court attorney initiate proceedings pursuant to the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act. In all other cases, the court shall stay the proceedings until the child is competent to stand trial; provided that a petition shall not be stayed for more than one year. The court may order treatment to enable the child to attain competency to stand trial and may amend the conditions of release pursuant to Sections 32A-2-11 and 32A-2-13 NMSA 1978. The child's competency to stand trial shall be reviewed every ninety days for up to one year. The court shall dismiss the petition without prejudice if, at any time during the year, the court finds that a child cannot be treated to competency or if, after one year, the court determines that a child is incompetent to stand trial or participate in his own defense. Upon dismissal, the court may recommend that the children's court attorney initiate proceedings pursuant to the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act.\n\nH. Involuntary residential treatment shall only occur pursuant to the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-21, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 50; 1995, ch. 206, § 15; 2005, ch. 189, § 18.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, in Subsection G, provided that if a child has been accused of an act that is a misdemeanor if the child were an adult and the child is found to be incompetent to stand trial, the court shall dismiss the petition and recommend that the children's court attorney proceed under the Children's Mental Health and Development Disabilities Act; that in all other cases, the court shall stay the proceedings until the child is competent to stand trial, but not longer than one year; that the court may order treatment to enable the child to be competent to stand trail; that the child's competency shall be reviewed every ninety days for up to one year and that the court shall dismiss the petition during the year if the child cannot be treated to competency; and added Subsection H, which provided that involuntary residential treatment shall occur pursuant to the Children's Mental Health and Development Disabilities Act.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, inserted \"delinquency\" following \"child in a\" in the section heading; substituted \"Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act\" for \"Children's Code\" and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section; deleted former Subsections B, C, F, and G, related to involuntary placement and residential treatment facilities, and redesignated the remaining subsections accordingly; in Subsection A, deleted former Paragraph (2) relating to a stay of the petition and redesignated former Paragraph (3) as Paragraph (2); in Subsection B, deleted \"or department of health\" following \"the department\"; rewrote Subsection E; and added Subsections F and G.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-35 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nDisposition of petition regarding incompetent child.— Where the evidence persuades the court that a child cannot likely be treated to competency, the court may, in the sound exercise of its discretion, dismiss a delinquency petition without prejudice.In re Daniel H., 2003-NMCA-063, 133 N.M. 630, 68 P.3d 176.\n\nA trial court is not required to dismiss a petition in every case where the child is found incompetent to stand trial and not amenable to treatment; rather, the court has the discretion to proceed consistent with 10-221(D) NMRA (now 10-242(D) NMRA), stay the proceedings on the petition, and order conditions of release or treatment. Dismissal without prejudice is an additional option for the trial court under such circumstances.In re Daniel H., 2003-NMCA-063, 133 N.M. 630, 68 P.3d 176.\n\nCommitment to boys' school of mentally ill and delinquent child.— The children's court did not err in committing mentally ill, delinquent children to state boys' school and in ordering that psychiatric care be provided them at the school.State v. Doe, 1977-NMCA-066, 90 N.M. 572, 566 P.2d 121.\n\nSection confers legislative grant of jurisdiction to the courts.— Children's court had jurisdiction to transfer child to the custody of state health and social services (now human services) department for further study and a report on the child's condition.In re Doe, 1975-NMCA-152, 88 N.M. 632, 545 P.2d 491.\n\nAvailability of accommodations controlling factor in determining admission.— Juvenile (now children's) courts do not have the power to commit juveniles to state institutions regardless of available accommodations. Availability of accommodations is made the controlling factor in determining admissions, and this question rests solely with the relators and not with the court.Carter v. Montoya, 1966-NMSC-021, 75 N.M. 730, 410 P.2d 951.\n\nCourt did not abuse its discretion in denying child's motion for transfer to more appropriate agency,where there was evidence that the only additional testing needed was an electroencephalogram and a neurological study which could be performed without the requested transfer.State v. Doe, 1978-NMCA-025, 91 N.M. 506, 576 P.2d 1137.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Treating Children Under the New Mexico Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code,\" see 10 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. At any time after the filing of a delinquency petition and before the entry of a judgment, the court may, on motion of the children's court attorney or that of counsel for the child, suspend the proceedings and continue the child under supervision in the child's own home under terms and conditions negotiated with probation services and agreed to by all the parties affected. The court's order continuing the child under supervision under this section shall be known as a \"consent decree\". An admission of some or all of the allegations stated in the delinquency petition shall not be required for a consent decree order.\n\nB. If the child objects to a consent decree, the court shall proceed to findings, adjudication and disposition of the case. If the child does not object but an objection is made by the children's court attorney after consultation with probation services, the court shall, after considering the objections and the reasons given, proceed to determine whether it is appropriate to enter a consent decree and may, in its discretion, enter the consent decree.\n\nC. A consent decree shall remain in force for six months unless the child is discharged sooner by probation services. Prior to the expiration of the six-month period and upon the application of probation services or any other agency supervising the child under a consent decree, the court may extend the decree for an additional six months in the absence of objection to extension by the child. If the child objects to the extension, the court shall hold a hearing and make a determination on the issue of extension.\n\nD. If either prior to discharge by probation services or expiration of the consent decree the child allegedly fails to fulfill the terms of the decree, the children's court attorney may file a petition to revoke the consent decree. Proceedings on the petition shall be conducted in the same manner as proceedings on petitions to revoke probation. If the child is found to have violated the terms of the consent decree, the court may:\n\n(1) extend the period of the consent decree; or\n\n(2) make any other disposition that would have been appropriate in the original proceeding.\n\nE. A child who is discharged by probation services or who completes a period under supervision without reinstatement of the original delinquency petition shall not again be proceeded against in any court for the same offense alleged in the petition or an offense based upon the same conduct and the original petition shall be dismissed with prejudice. Nothing in this subsection precludes a civil suit against the child for damages arising from the child's conduct.\n\nF. A judge who pursuant to this section elicits or examines information or material about a child that would be inadmissible in a hearing on the allegations of the petition shall not, over the objection of the child, participate in any subsequent proceedings on the delinquency if:\n\n(1) a consent decree is denied and the allegations in the petition remain to be decided in a hearing where the child denies the allegations; or\n\n(2) a consent decree is granted but the delinquency petition is subsequently reinstated.\n\nG. If a consent decree has been entered pursuant to the filing of a delinquency petition based on Paragraph (2), (3) or (4) of Subsection A of Section 32A-2-3 NMSA 1978 for a child who is fifteen years of age or older, a condition of the consent decree agreement may be the denial of the child's driving privileges or the revocation of the child's driver's license for a period of ninety days. For the second or subsequent adjudication, the child's driving privileges may be denied or the child's driver's license revoked for a period of one year. Within twenty-four hours of the entry by the court of a decree consenting to the revocation or denial of the child's driver's license or driving privileges, the court shall send the decree to the motor vehicle division of the taxation and revenue department. Upon receipt of the decree from the court consenting to the denial or revocation of the child's driving privileges or driver's license, the director of the motor vehicle division of the taxation and revenue department shall revoke or deny the delinquent child's driver's license or driving privileges. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the delinquent child from applying for a limited driving privilege pursuant to Section 66-5-35 NMSA 1978 or an ignition interlock license pursuant to the Ignition Interlock Licensing Act [66-5-501 to 66-5-504 NMSA 1978], and nothing in this section precludes the delinquent child's participation in an appropriate educational, counseling or rehabilitation program.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-22, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 51; 1995, ch. 206, § 16; 2003, ch. 239, § 6; 2005, ch. 189, § 19.\n\nCross references.— For consent decrees,seeRule 10-228 NMRA.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, in Subsection A, provided that an admission of some or all of the allegation stated in the delinquency petition shall not be required for a consent decree order and deleted former Subsection H which provided that the court shall not order more than one consent decree for a child in a two year period.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective April 6, 2003, added \"or an ignition interlock license pursuant to the Ignition Interlock Licensing Act\" following \"Section 66-5-35 NMSA 1978\" in the last sentence of Subsection G.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, made a minor stylistic change in Paragraph (2) of Subsection D, substituted \"32A-2-2\" for \"32-2-2\" in Subsection G, and added Subsection H.\n\nTime to hear petitions to revoke consent decrees.— The Children's Code explicitly mandates the use of Rule 10-226 NMRA (now 10-243 NMRA) for determining the applicable time limit within which the children's court must hear a petition to revoke a consent decree.State v. Katrina G., 2007-NMCA-048, 141 N.M. 501, 157 P.3d 66.\n\nAppealability of consent decree.— Where there might be future consequences attendant upon a consent decree the consequences of the consent decree sufficiently aggrieve the child such that her appeal should be allowed.State v. Crystal B., 2001-NMCA-010, 130 N.M. 336, 24 P.3d 771.\n\nDiscretion of court.— Accepting a consent decree is entirely within the discretion of the court.In re Crystal L., 2002-NMCA-063, 132 N.M. 349, 48 P.3d 87, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 397, 49 P.3d 76.\n\nAdmission of guilt.— A consent decree may only be accepted by the court after the child has made an admission of guilt.In re Crystal L., 2002-NMCA-063, 132 N.M. 349, 48 P.3d 87 (decided under prior law).\n\nTimeliness of decree.— A child who goes to trial and is adjudicated to have committed delinquent acts cannot avail herself of a consent decree after the court or jury has entered a verdict.In re Crystal L., 2002-NMCA-063, 132 N.M. 349, 48 P.3d 87, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 397, 49 P.3d 76.\n\nLaw reviews.— For survey, \"Children's Court Practice in Delinquency and Need of Supervision Cases Under the New Rules,\" see 6 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. A judgment transferring legal custody of an adjudicated delinquent child to an agency responsible for the care and rehabilitation of delinquent children divests the court of jurisdiction at the time of transfer of custody, unless the transfer of legal custody is for a commitment not exceeding fifteen days pursuant to the provisions of Section 32A-2-19 NMSA 1978, in which case the court retains jurisdiction.\n\nB. A judgment of probation or protective supervision shall remain in force for an indeterminate period not to exceed the term of commitment from the date entered.\n\nC. A child shall be released by an agency and probation or supervision shall be terminated by juvenile probation and parole services or the agency providing supervision when it appears that the purpose of the order has been achieved before the expiration of the period of the judgment. A release or termination and the reasons therefor shall be reported promptly to the court in writing by the releasing authority.\n\nD. Prior to the expiration of a short-term commitment of one year, as provided for in Section 32A-2-19 NMSA 1978, the court may extend the judgment for up to one six-month period if the court finds that the extension is necessary to safeguard the welfare of the child or the public safety. If a short-term commitment is extended, the mandatory ninety-day supervised release, as required by Section 32A-2-19 NMSA 1978, shall be included in the extension. Notice and hearing are required for any extension of a juvenile's commitment.\n\nE. Prior to the expiration of a long-term commitment, as provided for in Section 32A-2-19 NMSA 1978, the court may extend the judgment for additional periods of one year until the child reaches the age of twenty-one if the court finds that the extension is necessary to safeguard the welfare of the child or the public safety. If a long-term commitment is extended, the mandatory ninety-day supervised release, as required by Section 32A-2-19 NMSA 1978, shall be included in the extension. Notice and hearing are required for any extension of a juvenile's commitment.\n\nF. Prior to the expiration of a judgment of probation, the court may extend the judgment for an additional period of one year until the child reaches the age of twenty-one if the court finds that the extension is necessary to protect the community or to safeguard the welfare of the child.\n\nG. The court may dismiss a motion if it finds after preliminary investigation that the motion is without substance. If the court is of the opinion that the matter should be reviewed, it may, upon notice to all necessary parties, proceed to a hearing in the manner provided for hearings on petitions alleging delinquency. The court may terminate a judgment if it finds that the child is no longer in need of care, supervision or rehabilitation or it may enter a judgment extending or modifying the original judgment if it finds that action necessary to safeguard the child or the public interest.\n\nH. A child may make a motion to modify a children's court or adult disposition within thirty days of the judge's decision. If the court is of the opinion that the matter should be reviewed, it may, upon notice to all necessary parties, proceed to a hearing in the manner provided for hearings on petitions alleging delinquency.\n\nI. The department may seek a bench warrant from the court when the child absconds from supervised release.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-23, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 52; 1995, ch. 206, § 17; 2003, ch. 225, § 12; 2005, ch. 189, § 20; 2009, ch. 239, § 22.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, deleted Paragraph (1) of Subsection A, which provided that the juvenile parole board had exclusive power to parole or release the child; deleted Paragraph (2) of Subsection A, which provided that the supervision of a child after release shall be conducted by the department; deleted Paragraph (3) of Subsection A, which provided that the time a child absconds from parole or probation tolls all time limits for filing a petition to revoke probation or parole and the computation of the period of probation or parole; in Subsections D and E, changed \"parole\" to \"supervised release\"; and added Subsection I.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, deleted the former provision in Paragraph A(3), which provided that a child who completes a short term commitment of one year, upon release, shall be placed on parole and supervision for ninety days; added Subsection D, which provided that prior to the expiration of a short-term commitment of one year, the court may extend the judgment for up to one six-month period and if the short-term commitment is extended, the mandatory ninety-day parole shall be included in the extension; and added the provision in Subsection E that if a long-term commitment is extended, the mandatory ninety-day parole shall be included in the extension.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, added \"subject to the provisions of Section 32A-7-8 NMSA 1978\" at the end of Paragraph A(1); rewrote Paragraph A(2); added present Paragraph A(3); redesignated former Paragraph A(3) as Paragraph A(4).\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, substituted \"32A-2-19\" for \"32-2-19\" in Subsections A and D, deleted former Subsection E, relating to extension of six-month commitments for juveniles, redesignated the remaining subsections accordingly, and made a minor stylistic change in Subsection E.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-38 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nCourt's jurisdiction to modify disposition.— The children's court may modify a child's disposition after transfer of custody to the children, youth and families department when the court invites reconsideration of the child's disposition and finds the modification necessary to safeguard the child or the public interest.State v. Dylan A., 2007-NMCA-114, 142 N.M. 467, 166 P.3d 1121, cert. quashed 2008-NMCERT-003, 143 N.M. 681, 180 P.3d 1180.\n\nThere is no conflict between Subsection G [H]of this section and 10-230.1 B NMRA (now 10-252 NMRA).In re Michael L., 2002-NMCA-076, 132 N.M. 479, 50 P.3d 574, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 484, 51 P.3d 527.\n\nSubsections F and G [G and H] set out exceptionsto the general rule spelled out in Subsection A of this section.In re Michael L., 2002-NMCA-076, 132 N.M. 479, 50 P.3d 574, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 484, 51 P.3d 527.\n\nAge confinement must end.— Under the 1981 Children's Code, the courts do not have jurisdiction to extend a child's confinement beyond the age of eighteen.State v. Adam M., 1998-NMCA-014, 124 N.M. 505, 953 P.2d 40.\n\nThe constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws prevents the courts from applying the Children's Code adopted in 1993, which permits the confinement of a child until he or she reaches the age of twenty-one where the delinquent acts and original adjudication occurred while the prior code was in effect.State v. Adam M., 1998-NMCA-014, 124 N.M. 505, 953 P.2d 40.\n\nLength of commitments.— All commitments under Delinquency Act represent maximum time that a child may spend in custody.State v. Indie C., 2006-NMCA-014, 139 N.M. 80, 128 P.3d 508, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-001, 139 N.M. 273, 131 P.3d 660.\n\nCourt's jurisdiction to extend commitment.— The court's jurisdiction to extend a delinquent child's commitment was not affected by the fact that the juvenile parole board had issued a certificate of discharge.In re Ruben D., 2001-NMCA-006, 130 N.M. 110, 18 P.3d 1063, cert. denied, 130 N.M. 154, 20 P.3d 811.\n\nEvidence sufficient to extend commitment.— Evidence that the child did not make any progress in his rehabilitation for the first 18 months of his two-year commitment and of his anger management problems, coupled with his escape and his failure to obtain his graduate equivalency diploma was sufficient to find that an extension of his commitment was necessary.In re Ruben D., 2001-NMCA-006, 130 N.M. 110, 18 P.3d 1063, cert. denied, 130 N.M. 154, 20 P.3d 811.\n\nCommitment to boys' school for two years was improper.State v. Doe, 1979-NMCA-021, 93 N.M. 206, 598 P.2d 1166.\n\nMotion for reconsideration filed after thirty-day period.— Children's court was without jurisdiction to modify a commitment to the children, youth and families department, where the child's motion for reconsideration on grounds of abuse was filed after the thirty-day period. Instead, the child's remedy for alleged abuses is under Section 32A-4-3 NMSA 1978.In re Zac McV., 1998-NMCA-114, 125 N.M. 583, 964 P.2d 144, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 107, 967 P.2d 447.\n\nChild is not entitled to precommitment credit for time served while on probation.State v. Dennis F., 1986-NMCA-081, 104 N.M. 619, 725 P.2d 595.\n\nCourt's jurisdiction ends upon transferring child to human services department [health care authority department].— Once the children's court transfers legal custody of a child to the health and social services department (now health care authority department), the court's jurisdiction ends, and so, having transferred legal custody to the department, the children's court had no authority to order the department to place the physical custody of the child with any particular organization.Health & Soc. Servs. Dep't v. Doe, 1978-NMCA-045, 91 N.M. 675, 579 P.2d 801.\n\nAuthority to petition for parole extension.— Probation officer has authority to petition the court for extension of the period of parole supervision of a child where such action is necessary to safeguard the welfare of the child or the public interest.State v. Doe, 1979-NMCA-024, 92 N.M. 589, 592 P.2d 189.\n\nJurisdiction in subsequent proceeding.— Children's court could adjudicate child as delinquent and commit him to an indeterminate sentence not to exceed two years, notwithstanding his prior adjudication in another case. Moreover, the disposition was not rendered invalid by its effect on the child's eligibility for an alternative placement.In re Augustine R., 1998-NMCA-139, 126 N.M. 122, 967 P.2d 462.\n\nChildren's court had jurisdiction to modify child's sentencefour months after sentencing him to the custody of the children, youth and families department.State v. Carlos A., 1996-NMCA-082, 122 N.M. 241, 923 P.2d 608.\n\nRecommitment standard.— An order of recommitment under Subsection D must review the child's progress during his term of initial commitment; the acts that justified the original commitment cannot provide the sole basis for extending the commitment.State v. Sergio B., 2002-NMCA-070, 132 N.M. 375, 48 P.3d 764.\n\nWritten motion was not requiredto allow the children's' court to modify a child's sentence.State v. Carlos A., 1996-NMCA-082, 122 N.M. 241, 923 P.2d 608.\n\nCourt-invited motions.— 10-230.1 B NMRA (now 10-252 NMRA) makes no reference to court-invited motions allowed under Subsection F of this section.In re Michael L., 2002-NMCA-076, 132 N.M. 479, 50 P.3d 574, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 484, 51 P.3d 527.\n\nTime limit on court ruling.— Where 10-230.1 NMRA (now 10-252 NMRA) required juvenile's motion to reconsider, filed pursuant to Subsection 32A-2-23G (now H) NMSA 1978, to be ruled upon within 90 (now 60) days after filing, children's court erred in ruling on motion after the 90 (now 60) day period elapsed and the motion should have been deemed denied.In re Christobal V., 2002-NMCA-077, 132 N.M. 474, 50 P.3d 569, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 484, 51 P.3d 527.\n\nCourt's authority after child in custody of department.— Once legal custody is in the department of human services, the children's court has no authority to prohibit the department from placing physical custody of the child with any particular person.In re Jacinta M., 1988-NMCA-100, 107 N.M. 769, 764 P.2d 1327.\n\nSexual orientation of proposed custodian,standing alone, is not enough to support a conclusion that the person cannot provide a proper environment.In re Jacinta M., 1988-NMCA-100, 107 N.M. 769, 764 P.2d 1327.\n\nTime limitation on custody transfer void.— While the court possesses the power to transfer legal custody of delinquent children to an agency responsible for their care and rehabilitation, any attempt by the court to impose a time limitation on the transfer of custody, even if well within the time limitations already authorized by statute, is void as being in excess of the court's jurisdiction. 1979 Op.

The department shall have exclusive jurisdiction and authority to release an adjudicated delinquent child during the term of the child's commitment, consistent with the provisions of the Victims of Crime Act [Chapter 31, Article 26 NMSA 1978]. In determining whether to release a child, the department shall give due consideration to public safety, the extent to which the child has been rehabilitated, the adequacy and suitability of the proposed release plan and the needs and best interests of the child, including the child's need for behavioral health or medical services that are not available in facilities for adjudicated delinquent children.\n\nB.

In the event release for a child is denied by the department after release is recommended for the child by the juvenile public safety advisory board, or release is approved by the department after the board has recommended that the child not be released, within ten days, the board may request a review of the decision by the court of the judicial district from which legal custody of the child was transferred, and the department shall transmit the child's records to the court. The court shall have jurisdiction to review the matter without conducting a formal hearing and to issue an order that either denies or grants release to the child. If the board requests review under this section, the child shall not be released until such time as the court has issued a decision. If the board does not petition the district court for review of the department's decision to grant or deny release within ten days of the department's decision, the department's decision shall be final, and the department shall release the child or continue the commitment in accordance with the terms of its decision.\n\nE. The secretary of children, youth and families or the secretary's designee may review the case of any child upon the child's or the juvenile public safety advisory board's reasonable request at any time after release is denied.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-23.1, as enacted by Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 23.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 72 made this section effective July 1, 2009.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.",

      "heading": "Probation revocation; disposition.",
      "text": "A. A child on probation incident to an adjudication as a delinquent child who violates a term of the probation may be proceeded against in a probation revocation proceeding. A proceeding to revoke probation shall be begun by filing in the original proceeding a petition styled as a \"petition to revoke probation\". Petitions to revoke probation shall be screened, reviewed and prepared in the same manner and shall contain the same information as petitions alleging delinquency. Procedures of the Delinquency Act regarding taking into custody and detention shall apply. The petition shall state the terms of probation alleged to have been violated and the factual basis for these allegations.\n\nB. The standard of proof in probation revocation proceedings shall be evidence beyond a reasonable doubt and the hearings shall be before the court without a jury. In all other respects, proceedings to revoke probation shall be governed by the procedures, rights and duties applicable to proceedings on a delinquency petition. If a child is found to have violated a term of the child's probation, the court may extend the period of probation or make any other judgment or disposition that would have been appropriate in the original disposition of the case.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-2-24, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 53; 2009, ch. 239, § 25.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection B, after \"violated a term of\", deleted \"his\" and add \"the child's\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-43 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nRule 10-226 NMRA (now 10-243 NMRA)governs the time limits within which the children's court must hear a petition to revoke probation.State v. Katrina G., 2007-NMCA-048, 141 N.M. 501, 157 P.3d 66.\n\nProbation revocation procedures not mandated.— This section does not mandate that in order for the children's court to order detention for violation of probation, the court must follow probation revocation procedures in all instances.State v. Steven B., 2004-NMCA-086, 136 N.M. 111, 94 P.3d 854, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-007, 136 N.M. 452, 99 P.3d 1164.\n\nValid probation order.— Since the order placing the child on probation was void, the situation was as if no probation order had been entered, and thus the order revoking probation was without legal effect despite the fact that the court attempted therein to supply the requisite finding that the child was in need of rehabilitation, absence of which had rendered the initial probation order void.State v. Doe, 1977-NMCA-023, 90 N.M. 249, 561 P.2d 948.\n\nGoverned by procedure applicable to delinquency petition.— Generally, proceedings to revoke probation are governed by the procedure applicable to proceedings on a delinquency petition.State v. Doe, 1977-NMCA-023, 90 N.M. 249, 561 P.2d 948.\n\nChild to be informed of violated condition of probation.— Trial court violated child's right to due process by revoking his probation, absent competent evidence that respondent had been informed of the condition of probation which he allegedly violated.State v. Doe, 1986-NMCA-019, 104 N.M. 107, 717 P.2d 83.\n\nJuveniles entitled to confront witnesses during revocation proceedings.— A child whose probation is sought to be revoked shall be entitled to all the rights a child alleged to be delinquent is entitled to under the law, and since juveniles have the right to confront witnesses during delinquency proceedings, they must be accorded that right in probation revocation proceedings.State v. Trevor M., 2015-NMCA-009.\n\nAnalysis of right to confrontation.— The right to confrontation provided by this section is the same right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and consequently, the analysis of an alleged violation of this right is the same, and as in the analysis of the Sixth Amendment right, this right is not absolute, and deviation from live, face-to-face testimony may be permitted when an exception is necessary to further an important public policy, such exception being supported by a particularized showing of necessity by the district court.State v. Trevor M., 2015-NMCA-009.\n\nChild's right to confront witnesses violated.— Where state's witness, who could not attend the proceedings on the day of the hearing, testified by telephone over the child's objections, and where the district court failed to make any findings on the necessity of telephonic testimony, the child's right to confront witnesses against him was violated.State v. Trevor M., 2015-NMCA-009.\n\nNew trial required only if violation of right is harmful.— A violation of the right to confrontation alone does not require a new trial, but only when a violation of the confrontation right is harmful to the defendant does the violation require a new trial, and the burden is on the state to show the violation was harmless.State v. Trevor M., 2015-NMCA-009.\n\nState failed to meet its burden.— Where state failed to address whether any violation of the child's right to confrontation was harmless, the state failed to meet its burden, and therefore the child was entitled to a new probation revocation proceeding.State v. Trevor M., 2015-NMCA-009.\n\nSelf-executing provision in a probation order,requiring automatic confinement in the juvenile detention center merely upon a reported absence from school, was invalid because it would circumvent the procedural requirements, but was separable from the remaining portion of the probation order.State v. Henry Don S., 1990-NMCA-029, 109 N.M. 777, 790 P.2d 1058, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 704, 780 P.2d 1271.\n\nDetermination based on verified facts.— The determination of whether a juvenile violated the conditions of his probation must be based on verified facts.State v. Doe, 1986-NMCA-019, 104 N.M. 107, 717 P.2d 83.\n\nProof of a probation violation.— To establish a violation of a probation agreement, the obligation is on the state to prove willful conduct on the part of the probationer.State v. Trevor M., 2015-NMCA-009.\n\nInsufficient evidence to support willful conduct.— Where child was discharged from an out-of-home placement, such placement being a condition of probation, and where all of the testimony by the juvenile probation officer and the social worker was improperly admitted in a juvenile probation revocation proceeding, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of willful conduct on the part of the child.State v. Trevor M., 2015-NMCA-009.\n\nRevocation of juvenile parole for adult offenses.— The order of the children's court revoking the defendant's probation based on offenses committed by the defendant after he became an adult for which he was convicted and fined did not violate his constitutional rights guaranteeing protection against double jeopardy; since with respect to adult offenders any punishment resulting from revocation of a defendant's probation is punishment that relates to the person's original offense, an individual's subsequent prosecution for the same conduct in a new proceeding does not violate double jeopardy principles.In re Lucio F.T., 1994-NMCA-144, 119 N.M. 76, 888 P.2d 958.\n\nApplicability of Rules of Evidence.— The Rules of Evidence apply to the adjudicatory phase of juvenile probation revocation proceedings; however, they do not apply to the dispositional phase.State v. Erickson K., 2002-NMCA-058, 132 N.M. 258, 46 P.3d 1258, cert. quashed, 132 N.M. 732, 55 P.3d 428.\n\nImproper procedures.— If a special master lacks authority to hear a probation revocation petition, the court is without jurisdiction at the hearing on the petition.State v. Doe, 93 N.M. 621, 603 P.2d 731 (Ct. App. 1979).\n\nWhen the district judge disposes of the case more than 30 days after the petition is filed, the petition should be dismissed with prejudice.State v. Doe, 1979-NMCA-126, 93 N.M. 621, 603 P.2d 731.\n\nRevocation improper.— Revocation of the juvenile's probation was improper pursuant to this section where the juvenile did not willfully violate his probation agreement when he left the state because all evidence showed that the mother was responsible for making the decision to leave the state; further, the drug test result should not have been considered by the trial court because they did not meet the admissibility requirements.In re Bruno R., 2003-NMCA-057,133 N.M. 566, 66 P.3d 339, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 593, 66 P.3d 962.\n\nExtrajudicial admissions.— Without proof of drug testing, the admission of the juvenile could not stand as the sole evidence of the violation because extrajudicial admissions or confessions were not sufficient as evidence that a child committed delinquent acts absent other corroborating evidence.In re Bruno R., 2003-NMCA-057, 133 N.M. 566, 66 P.3d 339, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 593, 66 P.3d 962.\n\nAm.

If requested in the motion, the court shall also order law enforcement files and records sealed. An order sealing records and files shall be entered if the court finds that:\n\n(1) two years have elapsed since the final release of the person from legal custody and supervision or two years have elapsed since the entry of any other judgment not involving legal custody or supervision;\n\n(2) the person has not, within the two years immediately prior to filing the motion, been convicted of a felony or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude or been found delinquent by a court and no proceeding is pending seeking such a conviction or finding; and\n\n(3) the person is eighteen years of age or older or the court finds that good cause exists to seal the records prior to the child's eighteenth birthday.\n\nB.

Any finding of delinquency or need of services or conviction of a crime subsequent to the sealing order may at the court's discretion be used by the court as a basis to set aside the sealing order.\n\nF.

A child who has been the subject of a petition filed pursuant to the provisions of the Delinquency Act shall be notified in writing by the department when the child reaches the age of eighteen or at the expiration of legal custody and supervision, whichever occurs later, that the department's records have been sealed and that the court, the children's court attorney, the child's attorney and the referring law enforcement agency have been notified that the child's records are subject to sealing.\n\nH. The department shall seal the child's files and records when the child reaches the age of eighteen or at the expiration of the disposition, whichever occurs later. The department shall notify the children's court attorney, the child's attorney and the referring law enforcement agency that the child's records are subject to sealing.\n\nI. Youthful offender records sealed pursuant to Subsection H of this section may be unsealed by the court along with any evidence given in a hearing in court for a youthful offender for the purpose of considering the setting of bail or other conditions of release of a person charged with a felony, whether charged as an adult or juvenile.\n\nJ.

Any person may recover damages not to exceed four thousand dollars ($4,000) in a civil action in a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction from the parent or guardian having custody and control of a child when the child has maliciously or willfully injured a person or damaged, destroyed or deprived use of property, real or personal, belonging to the person bringing the action.\n\nB.

Nolle, 1982-NMCA-085, 98 N.M. 100, 645 P.2d 456.\n\nEqual protection.— A similar statute does not deprive parents of equal protection of the laws.Alber v. Nolle, 1982-NMCA-085, 98 N.M. 100, 645 P.2d 456.\n\nLegislative intent.— A similar statute constituted a legislative recognition of the moral duty owed by a parent to exercise reasonable care so as to control his minor child and prevent him from maliciously or willfully damaging the property of another.Potomac Ins. Co. v. Torres, 1965-NMSC-041, 75 N.M. 129, 401 P.2d 308.\n\nDefinition of \"willful\" and \"malicious\" conduct.— There is very little, if any, difference between \"willful\" and \"malicious\" conduct, and an act done \"willfully\" or \"maliciously\" means the intentioned doing of a harmful act without just cause or excuse or an intentional act done in utter disregard for the consequences, and does not necessarily mean actual malice or ill will.Potomac Ins. Co. v. Torres, 1965-NMSC-041, 75 N.M. 129, 401 P.2d 308;Ortega v. Montoya, 1981-NMSC-135, 97 N.M. 159, 637 P.2d 841.\n\nYoung child may be capable of willful and malicious conduct.— As a matter of law, a young child is not incapable of willful and malicious conduct in committing an intentional tort. It is for the trier of fact to determine, based upon the child's age, experience and mental capacity, whether the child acted in a willful and malicious manner.Ortega v. Montoya, 1981-NMSC-135, 97 N.M. 159, 637 P.2d 841.\n\nStatutory basis required for parental liability.— In the absence of statutory authority, there is no basis for holding the parents, qua parents, civilly liable for crimes of their minor child.Lamb v. Randall, 1980-NMCA-144, 95 N.M. 35, 618 P.2d 379.\n\nRequisite malice or willfulness may be readily inferred from defendant's actin driving at excessive speeds in a crowded business district, in attempting to evade police pursuit, and in striking a car which was stopped at a red traffic light.Potomac Ins. Co. v. Torres, 1965-NMSC-041, 75 N.M. 129, 401 P.2d 308.\n\nChild need not first be found liable.— There is no requirement, as a predicate for parental liability, that the child be first found liable.Alber v. Nolle, 1982-NMCA-085, 98 N.M. 100, 645 P.2d 456.\n\nParents do not have property right in their child's teeth.— The court found no logical reason which would justify holding that either their child's teeth or the investment in orthodontic work on them should properly be considered as property of the parent, and for the damage or destruction of which recovery might be had.Ross v. Souter, 1970-NMCA-011, 81 N.M. 181, 464 P.2d 911.\n\nPain and suffering is an actual damage recoverableunder the parental liability statute.Alber v.
