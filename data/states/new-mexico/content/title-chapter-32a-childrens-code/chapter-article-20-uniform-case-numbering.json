In any investigation, intervention or disposition of a case involving child abuse or neglect, including child sexual abuse, a uniform case number shall be assigned to the investigation and shall be maintained and referred to by all persons or agencies having occasion to become involved in any way in the investigation, intervention or disposition of the case.\n\nC. A uniform case numbering system shall be devised, proposed and, after opportunity for public input, adopted by:\n\n(1) the department;\n\n(2) the secretary of public safety or his designee;\n\n(3) the secretary of the department or his designee;\n\n(4) the secretary of health or his designee;\n\n(5) the superintendent of public instruction or his designee;\n\n(6) the chief justice of the supreme court or his designee; and\n\n(7) a representative of the elected or appointed district attorneys.\n\nD.
