      "text": "Chapter 32A, Article 4 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Abuse and Neglect Act\".\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-4-1, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 95; 2016, ch. 54, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For provisions of Safe Haven for Infants Act,see24-22-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor abuse of a child,see30-6-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the Kinship Guardianship Act,see40-10B-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nThe 2016 amendment,effective May 18, 2016, after \"Chapter\", deleted \"32\" and added \"32A\".\n\nAct not unconstitutionally vague.— Abuse and Neglect Act is not unconstitutionally vague.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dept. v. Shawna C., 2005-NMCA-066, 137 N.M. 687, 114 P.3d 367.\n\nPresumption of retroactivity.— Based on the importance of the especially significant interests at stake for children and parents in cases involving the Abuse and Neglect Act, Chapter 32A, Article 4 NMSA 1978, as well as the need to eliminate disparate outcomes in such cases simply by virtue of the position of a case on the judicial docket, the presumption of retroactivity applies to abuse and neglect cases.State ex rel. CYFD v. Ruben C., 2022-NMCA-063, cert. granted.\n\nClarifications of New Mexico law regarding standards of proof in termination of parental rights cases subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act.— The New Mexico court of appeals decision inState ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Maisie Y., 2021-NMCA-023 (Maisie Y.), which held that in cases subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), all grounds to terminate parental rights, including determinations of abuse and neglect, must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, judicial notice of prior adjudications of abuse and neglect made under the clear and convincing evidence standard, without more, is insufficient, and the active efforts requirement of the ICWA must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, will be applied retroactively.State ex rel. CYFD v. Ruben C., 2022-NMCA-063, cert. granted.\n\nRemoval of an Indian child from the custody of their guardian requires a finding that active efforts designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family have been made.— When a petition for abuse and neglect seeking removal of an Indian child from the custody of their parent or legal guardian is filed by CYFD, the district court must make findings required by the federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) at the adjudicatory hearing, including the finding that active efforts designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family have been made. The ICWA regulations and the legislative history of ICWA require remedial active efforts be made prior to initiating a placement and must be designed to prevent having to take a child into state custody. The definition of active efforts focuses on the timeliness of those efforts, provides that they be directed to maintaining the Indian child with their family, or, if a separation has already occurred, reuniting the child with their family, and specifies that efforts be conducted, to the maximum extent possible, in partnership with the Indian child's tribe and extended family. Active assistance in utilizing, accessing, and overcoming barriers to services is required regardless of the stage of the proceedings, and to be effective, remedial efforts must be undertaken promptly upon referral to the agency for abuse or neglect.State ex rel. CYFD v. Eric E., 2024-NMCA-026.\n\nThe district court's finding that the active efforts required by the federal Indian Child Welfare Act were made by CYFD prior to taking the Indian child into involuntary state custody was not supported by substantial evidence.— The district court's finding that CYFD made the active efforts required by the federal Indian Child Welfare Act prior to taking the Indian child into involuntary state custody was not supported by substantial evidence where the record established that CYFD's efforts were not tailored to the goal of restoring the child to his parents, to his extended Indian family, or to his tribal community; CYFD failed to actively search for the child's father and prepare him to reunite with the child, it failed to contact and obtain assistance from the child's tribe, it failed to provide any assistance to the child's guardians in freeing the child for return to a parent or placement with an extended family member, and it offered no evidence to show that it had made active efforts to place the child in the treatment foster care recommended by the residential treatment center where the child had been placed.State ex rel. CYFD v. Eric E., 2024-NMCA-026.\n\nApplication of higher standards of proof required byState ex rel. CYFD v. Maisie Y.— Where father's parental rights were terminated prior to the New Mexico court of appeals decision inState ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Maisie Y., 2021-NMCA-023 (Maisie Y.), which held that in cases subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), all grounds to terminate parental rights, including determinations of abuse and neglect, must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, judicial notice of prior adjudications of abuse and neglect made under the clear and convincing evidence standard, without more, is insufficient, and the active efforts requirement of the ICWA must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the district court's termination of father's parental rights required reversal, because it was possible that CYFD may not have met the higher standards of proof required byMaisie Y.State ex rel. CYFD v. Ruben C., 2022-NMCA-063, cert. granted.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— The New Mexico constitution and double jeopardy statute, Section 30-1-10 NMSA 1978, do not prohibit the state from prosecuting defendants for child abuse because CYFD previously investigated defendants for child abuse and the tribal court previously held a custody hearing on the same issues. In the previous proceedings, the civil sanctions imposed on the defendant were remedial rather than punitive.State v. Diggs, 2009-NMCA-099, 147 N.M. 122, 217 P.3d 608, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 362, 223 P.3d 359.\n\nBecause the statutory scheme of the Abuse and Neglect Actis unitary in nature, the process due at each stage should be evaluated in light of the process received throughout the proceedings.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't. v. Maria C., 2004-NMCA-083, 136 N.M. 53, 94 P.3d 796.\n\nParent has constitutional right to fair notice and opportunity to participate in all critical stagesof abuse and neglect proceedings.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't. v. Maria C., 2004-NMCA-083, 136 N.M. 53, 94 P.3d 796.\n\nDistrict court has affirmative dutyto ensure the parents' due process rights are protected from the initiation of abuse and neglect proceedings.State ex rel.

or\n\n(5) who has been placed for care or adoption in violation of the law; provided that nothing in the Children's Code shall be construed to imply that a child who is being provided with treatment by spiritual means alone through prayer, in accordance with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination, by a duly accredited practitioner thereof is for that reason alone a neglected child within the meaning of the Children's Code; and further provided that no child shall be denied the protection afforded to all children under the Children's Code;\n\nH. \"physical abuse\" includes any case in which the child suffers strangulation or suffocation and any case in which the child exhibits evidence of skin bruising, bleeding, malnutrition, failure to thrive, burns, fracture of any bone, subdural hematoma, soft tissue swelling or death and:\n\n(1) there is not a justifiable explanation for the condition or death;\n\n(2) the explanation given for the condition is at variance with the degree or nature of the condition;\n\n(3) the explanation given for the death is at variance with the nature of the death;

The plan shall also include responsibilities of the child, and any other party as appropriate, to enable the child to be self-sufficient upon emancipation.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-4-2, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 96; 1997, ch. 34, § 1; 1999, ch. 77, § 3; 2009, ch. 239, § 33; 2016, ch. 54, § 2; 2017, ch. 64, § 2; 2018, ch. 30, § 3; 2023, ch. 90, § 20.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective July 1. 2023, left the provisions of this section unamended.\n\nThe 2018 amendment,effective July 1, 2018, included \"strangulation\" and \"suffocation\" within the definition of \"physical abuse\", and added definitions of \"strangulation\" and \"suffocation\" to the Abuse and Neglect Act; in Subsection H, after \"in which the child\", added \"suffers strangulation or suffocation and any case in which the child\"; and added Subsections M and N.\n\nThe 2017 amendment,effective June 16, 2017, defined \"educational decision maker\" as used in the Abuse and Neglect Act; added a new Subsection D and redesignated former Subsections D through L as Subsections E through M, respectively; and in Subsections H, J and K, after \"includes\", deleted \"but is not limited to\".\n\nThe 2016 amendment,effective May 18, 2016, added \"fictive kin\", \"relative\" and \"sibling\" to the definitions section of the Abuse and Neglect Act; added new Subsection D and redesignated former Subsections D, E and F as Subsections E, F and G, respectively; added new Subsection H and redesignated former Subsections G and H as Subsections I and J, respectively; and added new Subsection K and redesignated the succeeding subsection accordingly.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, added Subsection I.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, deleted \"but is not limited to\" following \"includes\" in the introductory language of Subsection A; in Subsection B, in Paragraph (1), inserted \"has suffered or who\" and added the language beginning \"because of\" to the end, and in Paragraph (2), inserted \"or caused\"; added Subsections C and D and redesignated the subsequent subsections accordingly; in Subsection E, in Paragraph (2), substituted \"failure\" for \"neglect\", and in Paragraph (4), deleted \"other\" following \"hospitalization or\".\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective July 1, 1997, added Paragraph B(1) and redesignated former Paragraphs B(1) to (4) as Paragraphs B(2) to (5).\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-3 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nStandard of proof of abuse and neglect at adjudicatory hearing.— Where father's parental rights to his three children were terminated following the district court's adjudication of neglect, and where father argued that the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) and New Mexico state law require the district court at the adjudicatory hearing to find that father abused or neglected children by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, rather than by clear and convincing evidence, the district court did not err in applying a clear and convincing standard of proof at the adjudicatory hearing, because proof of neglect or abuse at an adjudicatory hearing in an ICWA case in New Mexico is by clear and convincing evidence, and in this case, the district court properly found neglect by father under 32A-4-2(G)(2) NMSA 1978, at the adjudicatory hearing, applying the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof, and in contrast, made its finding of neglect at the termination of parental rights (TPR) hearing by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. There was no error in these finding or in the standard of proof applied by the district court at either the adjudicatory hearing or the TPR hearing.CYFD v. James M., 2023-NMCA-025, cert. denied.\n\nProof of perpetrator of child abuse.— Subsection B of Section 32A-4-2 NMSA 1978 does not require a specific determination of which parent's actions or inactions caused a child to be put at risk when adjudicating the child as abused and evidence that the abuse was perpetrated by either parent is sufficient for a court to conclude that the action or inaction of a parent caused the abuse and bring the case within the scope of the statute.State ex rel. Children, Youth and Families Dep't v. Carl C., 2012-NMCA-065, 281 P.3d 1242.\n\nWhere the parents of a child were the primary caregivers of the child; the court found by clear and convincing evidence that one parent or the other parent, or both, had caused severe physical injuries to the child; and the court could not determine which parent specifically had been the perpetrator, the court did not err in adjudicating the child as abused without determining which parent actually caused the injuries suffered by the child.State ex rel. Children, Youth and Families Dep't v. Carl C., 2012-NMCA-065, 281 P.3d 1242.\n\nAct not unconstitutionally vague.— Abuse and Neglect Act is not unconstitutionally vague.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dept. v. Shawna C., 2005-NMCA-066, 137 N.M. 687, 114 P.3d 367.\n\nSufficient evidence of neglect.— Where the children lived with the mother; the father and the mother failed to see to the well-being, needs and support of the children; the father knew about the mother's propensities for drug abuse and domestic violence and knew or should have known about the children, youth and families department involvement with the children and the placement of the children with fictive kin; the father indicated to the department that he had no concerns regarding the care of the children; the father failed to respond to messages from the department and failed to appear at meetings with the department; the father was delinquent with child support; the father visited the children only once or twice a month; and the father made no effort to have the children live with him, the evidence was clear and convincing that the father neglected the children.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Cosme V., 2009-NMCA-094, 146 N.M. 809, 215 P.3d 747, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 361, 223 P.3d 358.\n\nSufficient evidence of neglect based on abandonment.— Where father was found by the district court to have neglected his child by abandoning her, and where father claimed that his lack of knowledge that the child's mother, who had custody of the infant, would neglect her, and that his lack of certain knowledge, through DNA testing, that he in fact was the father of the child negated any conclusion of abandonment under 32A-4-2(A)(2) NMSA 1978, the district court's determination that father had abandoned and thus neglected the child were supported by clear and convincing evidence, where the evidence demonstrated that father left the child in the care of mother without provision for support or communication, that the child was neglected while in mother's care, and that father was on notice and acknowledged that he was the father of the child.State ex rel. CYFD v. Michael H., 2018-NMCA-032, cert. denied.\n\nInsufficient evidence of neglect.— Evidence that the newborn child's initial toxicology test was positive, that the mother admitted to using narcotics and marijuana during her pregnancy, and that the mother left the child in the care of nurses while she left the hospital to smoke was insufficient to make the child neglected because of the mother's intentional or negligent disregard of the child's wellbeing and proper needs.State ex rel., Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Amanda H., 2007-NMCA-029, 141 N.M. 299, 154 P.3d 674.\n\nEvidence that the mother of a newborn child had a long history of drug abuse, a criminal history and a history of violence was insufficient to show that the mother was actually unable to provide proper parental care or discharge her responsibilities to the child.State ex rel., Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Amanda H., 2007-NMCA-029, 141 N.M. 299, 154 P.3d 674.\n\nInsufficient evidence of mental disorder or incapacity.— Where the legislature intended mental incapacity to encompass those circumstances in which an individual, due to an intellectual disability, is unable, as opposed to unwilling, to discharge his or her responsibilities to a child, the district court's conclusion that child was neglected pursuant to 32A-4-2E(4) NMSA 1978 was not supported by the evidence when the district court did not make any findings that mother suffered from a mental disorder or illness, nor did it find that mother suffered from mental incapacity, but explicitly found that mother was capable of learning and mastering information, but that her defiant attitude was affecting her ability to recognize the conditions she needed to improve in order to safely parent child. The district court erred in concluding that child was neglected pursuant to 32A-4-2E(4) and in concluding that the children, youth and families department established by clear and convincing evidence that a mental disorder or incapacity caused mother's inability to discharge her responsibilities to child.State ex rel. CYFD v. Christina L., 2015-NMCA-115.\n\n\"Abandonment\".— Parent abandoned children when parent left children in the care of their other parent, when the parent knew about drugs and had neglected the children; parent offered very little support to children before becoming incarcerated and then squandered any opportunity to be present in the children's lives by violating probation and becoming incarcerated; and while in prison, parent made no attempts to contact or support the children or to ensure their safety.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. William M., 2007-NMCA-055, 141 N.M. 705, 161 P.3d 262.\n\n\"Abused child\".— Prior to its amendment in 1997, the definition of \"abused child,\" did not permit the children's court to adjudicate a child abused or neglected where there was no evidence that the parent, guardian or custodian was responsible for the abuse or neglect.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Vincent L., 1998-NMCA-089, 125 N.M. 452, 963 P.2d 529, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 654, 964 P.2d 818.\n\nProof that a child's sibling was abused, in and of itself, does not render the child endangered.— Where parents appealed the district court's adjudication of abuse against parent's son (child), based on the endangerment definition of \"abused child\" in § 32A-4-2(B)(4) NMSA 1978, and on the court's finding of aggravated circumstances under § 32A-4-2(C)(1), the district court erred in its finding of abuse, because the children, youth and families department (CYFD) did not meet its burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the parents' child was an \"abused child\" under § 32A-4-2(B)(4). CYFD's contention that the child's sibling was physically abused in and of itself is insufficient to support a finding that the child was \"abused\" or is endangered under § 32A-4-2(B)(4).CYFD v. Carmella M., 2022-NMCA-052.\n\n\"Abused and neglected\".— Where parent left the children unattended for long periods of time, exposed them to dangerous situations, failed to understand their physical and emotional needs, failed to empathize with their feelings, was self-centered in the parent's interactions with them, exposed them to domestic violence, exposed them to substance abuse, showed an indifference to their needs in favor of the parent's own needs, and placed them with inappropriate caretakers, the children were abused and neglected.In re Termination of Parental Rights of Eventyr J., 1995-NMCA-087, 120 N.M. 463, 902 P.2d 1066 (Ct. 108), cert. denied 120 N.M. 394, 902 P.2d 76.\n\n\"Aggravated circumstances\".— Sections 32A-4-2C, 32A-4-22C, 32A-4-28B(2) NMSA 1978 are constitutional facially and as applied to a mother, whose parental rights were terminated without the state making reasonable efforts toward family reunification, where the mother had previously had parental rights terminated as to another child and no progress was evident in the mother's efforts to kick a 4-year drug abuse problem.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Amy B., 2003-NMCA-017, 133 N.M. 136, 61 P.3d 845.\n\nWhere parent left the children in the care of another, was involved in criminal activity, became unavailable due to parent's incarceration, substance abuse was present in the home, and parent failed to maintain a relationship with the children, aggravating circumstances existed.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. William M., 2007-NMCA-055, 161 P.3d 262.\n\nWhere mother emphasized that she has not abused child and has not had an opportunity to actually demonstrate her parenting skills with child, and while true, the court noted that she has had an opportunity to demonstrate her abilities with five older children, and her admission of involuntary termination of her parental rights to those older children operates as clear and convincing proof of that fact, while this fact is not determinative for a finding of abuse and neglect, it is considered an aggravated circumstance under the Abuse and Neglect Act in the context of termination of parental rights.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dept. v. Shawna C., 2005-NMCA-066, 137 N.M. 687, 114 P.3d 367.\n\nStepfather as \"custodian\".— A stepfather meets the definition of \"custodian\" for purposes of the court's subject matter jurisdiction over him in a proceeding on a petition alleging abuse or neglect of a child.In re Candice Y., 2000-NMCA-035, 128 N.M. 813, 999 P.2d 1045, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 207, 4 P.3d 35.\n\n\"Neglected\".— Parent neglected children through parent's failure to be involved in the children's lives prior to parent's incarceration, failure to provide a safe and stable home by dealing drugs in the home, parent's decision to leave the children's home when they were very young, parent's decision to violate the terms of parent's probation resulting in parent's incarceration, and parent's failure to provide for the children or protect them from the other parent's neglect both prior to and during parent's incarceration.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. William M., 2007-NMCA-055, 141 N.M. 765, 161 P.3d 262.\n\nAlthough low IQ, mental disability, or mental illness alone are not sufficient grounds for a finding of abuse or neglect where mother was unable to effectively parent due to her mental disorder and incapacity, this finding meets the definition of neglect under Subsection E(4) of this section.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dept. v. Shawna C., 2005-NMCA-066, 137 N.M. 687, 114 P.3d 367.\n\nEvidence that a mother left her children in the care at their grandparents presented insufficient evidence to prove that mother was unfit to care for her children and failed to show that the children were \"neglected\" under Paragraph E(2), where mother left the children with the grandparents for extended periods of time but she visited them and had them to her various residences on a regular basis.In re Guardianship of Ashleigh R., 2002-NMCA-103, 132 N.M. 772, 55 P.3d 984, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 732, 55 P.3d 428.\n\nNeglect of psychological needs.— The New Mexico Children's Code's definition of a \"neglected child\" is subject to broad interpretation and arguably encompasses situations where the child's psychological needs are neglected.Martinez v. Mafchir, 35 F.3d 1486 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\nDefinition of \"sexual abuse\" constitutional.— The definition of \"sexual abuse\" in this section is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct which fit squarely within the specifically prohibited conduct, namely criminal sexual contact of a minor.In re Candice Y., 2000-NMCA-035, 128 N.M. 813, 999 P.2d 1045, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 207, 4 P.3d 35.\n\nRetardation evidence not required for ruling on neglect.— In a neglect proceeding, evidence that a child is severely retarded is not required for a ruling that the child is neglected.State ex rel. Health & Soc. Servs. Dep't v. Natural Father, 1979-NMCA-090, 93 N.M. 222, 598 P.2d 1182.\n\nIncarceration.— Even though incarceration alone is not an appropriate reason to terminate parental rights, where the father was convicted of the murder of the mother, his subsequent long-term incarceration was sufficient to establish that the child was neglected, and that termination of his parental rights was justified.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Joe R., 1997-NMSC-038, 123 N.M. 711, 945 P.2d 76.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"The Freedom of the Press vs. The Confidentiality Provisions in the New Mexico Children's Code,\" see 4 N.M.L. Rev. 119 (1973).\n\nFor article, \"Treating Children Under the New Mexico Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code,\" see 10 N.M.L. Rev. 279 (1980).\n\nFor note, \"Children's Code - Neglect - State ex rel. Health & Social Services Department v. Natural Father,\" see 12 N.M.L. Rev. 505 (1982).\n\nAm.

Every person, including a licensed physician; a resident or an intern examining, attending or treating a child; a law enforcement officer; a judge presiding during a proceeding; a registered nurse; a visiting nurse; a school employee; a social worker acting in an official capacity; or a member of the clergy who has information that is not privileged as a matter of law, who knows or has a reasonable suspicion that a child is an abused or a neglected child shall report the matter immediately to:\n\n(1) a local law enforcement agency;\n\n(2) the department; or\n\n(3) a tribal law enforcement or social services agency for any Indian child residing in Indian country.\n\nB. A law enforcement agency receiving the report shall immediately transmit the facts of the report and the name, address and phone number of the reporter by telephone to the department and shall transmit the same information in writing within forty-eight hours. The department shall immediately transmit the facts of the report and the name, address and phone number of the reporter by telephone to a local law enforcement agency and shall transmit the same information in writing within forty-eight hours. The written report shall contain the names and addresses of the child and the child's parents, guardian or custodian, the child's age, the nature and extent of the child's injuries, including any evidence of previous injuries, and other information that the maker of the report believes might be helpful in establishing the cause of the injuries and the identity of the person responsible for the injuries. The written report shall be submitted upon a standardized form agreed to by the law enforcement agency and the department.\n\nC. The recipient of a report under Subsection A of this section shall take immediate steps to ensure prompt investigation of the report. The investigation shall ensure that immediate steps are taken to protect the health or welfare of the alleged abused or neglected child, as well as that of any other child under the same care who may be in danger of abuse or neglect. A local law enforcement officer trained in the investigation of child abuse and neglect is responsible for investigating reports of alleged child abuse or neglect at schools, daycare facilities or child care facilities.\n\nD. If the child alleged to be abused or neglected is in the care or control of or in a facility administratively connected to the department, the report shall be investigated by a local law enforcement officer trained in the investigation of child abuse and neglect.

A person who violates the provisions of Subsection A of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-19-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nG. A finding that a pregnant woman is using or abusing drugs made pursuant to an interview, self-report, clinical observation or routine toxicology screen shall not alone form a sufficient basis to report child abuse or neglect to the department pursuant to Subsection A of this section. A volunteer, contractor or staff of a hospital or freestanding birthing center shall not make a report based solely on that finding and shall make a notification pursuant to Subsection H of this section. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent a person from reporting to the department a reasonable suspicion that a child is an abused or neglected child based on other criteria as defined by Section 32A-4-2 NMSA 1978, or a combination of criteria that includes a finding pursuant to this subsection.\n\nH. A volunteer, contractor or staff of a hospital or freestanding birthing center shall:\n\n(1) complete a written plan of care for a substance-exposed newborn as provided for by department rule and the Children's Code [Chapter 32A NMSA 1978]; and\n\n(2) provide notification to the department. Notification by a health care provider pursuant to this paragraph shall not be construed as a report of child abuse or neglect.\n\nI. As used in this section, \"notification\" means informing the department that a substance-exposed newborn was born and providing a copy of the plan of care that was created for the child; provided that notification shall comply with federal guidelines and shall not constitute a report of child abuse or neglect.\n\nJ. As used in this section, \"school employee\" includes employees of a school district or a public school.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-4-3, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 97; 1997, ch. 34, § 2; 2003, ch. 189, § 1; 2005, ch. 189, § 38; 2019, ch. 190, § 2; 2021, ch. 94, § 10.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective June 18, 2021, defined \"school employee\" as used in this section; in Subsection A, after \"visiting nurse; a\", deleted \"schoolteacher; a school official\" and added \"school employee\"; and added Subsection J.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective June 14, 2019, provided that a finding that a pregnant woman is using or abusing drugs shall not alone form a sufficient basis to report child abuse or neglect, required volunteers, contractors or staff of a hospital or freestanding birthing center to complete a written plan of care for a substance-exposed newborn and to provide notification to the children, youth and families department that a substance-exposed newborn was born; in the section heading, after \"penalty\", added \"notification of plan of care\"; and added Subsections G through I.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, deleted the requirement in Subsections A and B that reports be made to the department office in the county where the child resides; and provided in Subsections C and D that a law enforcement officer trained in the investigation of child abuse and neglect is responsible for investigating reports of abuse and neglect.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, in Subsection A, deleted \"but not limited to\" near the beginning, inserted \"or a member of the clergy who has information that is not privileged as a matter of law\" following \"an official capacity\"; substituted \"agency\" for \"agencies\" in Paragaraph A(3); substituted \"A department office\" for \"Any office of the department\" preceding \"receiving a report\" in Subsection B.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective July 1, 1997, inserted \"responsibility to investigate child abuse or neglect\" in the section heading, deleted \"or persons\" following \"person\" in the next-to-last sentence in Subsection B, substituted \"alleged abused\" for \"abused\" in the second sentence in Subsection C and in the second sentence in Subsection D, added the third sentence in Subsection C, deleted former Subsection D relating to abuse or neglect of a child while in the care of a child care facility or family day care home, redesignated former Subsections E to G as Subsections D to F, and substituted \"by local law enforcement\" for \"through the office of the district attorney\" at the end of the first sentence in Subsection D.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-15 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nScope of duty to report child abuse.— The child abuse reporting requirement of this section expressly applies to \"every person,\" and although the statute lists specific occupational groups, the language of the statute expressly emphasizes that the list is not exclusive.State v. Strauch, 2015-NMSC-009,rev'g2014-NMCA-020.\n\nStatements made by an alleged child abuser to his social worker therapist, a mandated reporter under the Abuse and Neglect Act, are not protected from disclosure in a court proceeding as a result of the specific exception to the physician-patient and psychotherapist-patient evidentiary privilege in Rule 11-504(D)(4) NMRA, which provides that no privilege shall apply for confidential communications concerning any material that a social worker is required by law to report to a public employee or public agency.State v. Strauch, 2015-NMSC-009,rev'g2014-NMCA-020.\n\n\"Official capacity\" defined.— The language \"acting in an official capacity\" as set forth in Subsection A of this section is synonymous with acting in a \"professional capacity\", and is used to distinguish between child abuse knowledge gained through activities in the listed occupations and knowledge gained in other capacities.State v. Strauch, 2015-NMSC-009,rev'g2014-NMCA-020.\n\nScope of duty to report child abuse.— The statutory requirement to report child abuse does not apply to every person, but instead applies to the categories of people listed in Section 32A-4-3(A) NMSA 1979 and other professionals or government officials who are likely to come into contact with abused and neglected children during the course of their professional work.State v. Strauch, 2014-NMCA-020, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-001.\n\nDuty of social workers to report child abuse.— The mandatory reporting requirement set forth in Section 32A-4-3(A) NMSA 1978 applies principally to social workers in school and other governmental settings.State v. Strauch, 2014-NMCA-020, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-001.\n\nSocial worker acting as a private mental health provider.— Where defendant, who was charged with criminal sexual penetration of a minor, made confidential communications to a licensed social worker during private counseling sessions for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment; and defendant's ex-spouse participated in the counseling sessions, defendant had the privilege pursuant to Rule 11-504 NMRA to refuse to disclose and to prevent the social worker and defendant's ex-spouse from disclosing information defendant communicated during the counseling sessions because the mandatory reporting requirement in Section 32A-4-3(A) NMSA did not apply to the social worker or to defendant's ex-spouse.State v. Strauch, 2014-NMCA-020, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-001.\n\nDismissals from human services department[health care authority department] were in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence, which included the failure to promptly report the alleged sexual abuse of a child to the proper authorities.Perkins v. Dep't of Human Servs., 1987-NMCA-148, 106 N.M. 651, 748 P.2d 24.\n\nRequirement of \"consultation\" in Section 32-1-15 NMSA 1978 is not due process pre-deprivation hearing requirement,and plaintiff day-care center operator's constitutional right to due process was not violated by the human services department's [health care authority department's] transfer of state subsidized children to other facilities and suspension of federal funds pending completion of an investigation.Rice v.

If a report alleging neglect or abuse meets the criteria established pursuant to Section 32A-4-4.1 NMSA 1978, the department may assign the case to the multilevel response system.\n\nC. During the investigation of a report alleging neglect or abuse, the matter may be referred to another appropriate agency and conferences may be conducted for the purpose of effecting adjustments or agreements that will obviate the necessity for filing a petition. A representative of the department shall, at the initial time of contact with the party subject to the investigation, advise the party of the reports or allegations made, in a manner that is consistent with laws protecting the rights of the informant. The parties shall be advised of their basic rights and no party may be compelled to appear at any conference, to produce any papers or to visit any place.

For each family, including the child who is the subject of a report to the department and that child's relatives, caretakers or guardians, that receives services under the multilevel response system, the department shall conduct a family assessment. Based on the results of the family assessment, the department may offer or provide referrals for counseling, training or other services aimed at addressing the underlying causative factors jeopardizing the safety or well-being of the child who is the subject of a report to the department.

The ICWA regulations and the legislative history of ICWA require remedial active efforts be made prior to initiating a placement and must be designed to prevent having to take a child into state custody. The definition of active efforts focuses on the timeliness of those efforts, provides that they be directed to maintaining the Indian child with their family, or, if a separation has already occurred, reuniting the child with their family, and specifies that efforts be conducted, to the maximum extent possible, in partnership with the Indian child's tribe and extended family. Active assistance in utilizing, accessing, and overcoming barriers to services is required regardless of the stage of the proceedings, and to be effective, remedial efforts must be undertaken promptly upon referral to the agency for abuse or neglect.State ex rel. CYFD v. Eric E., 2024-NMCA-026.\n\nThe district court's finding that the active efforts required by the federal Indian Child Welfare Act were made by CYFD prior to taking the Indian child into involuntary state custody was not supported by substantial evidence.— The district court's finding that CYFD made the active efforts required by the federal Indian Child Welfare Act prior to taking the Indian child into involuntary state custody was not supported by substantial evidence where the record established that CYFD's efforts were not tailored to the goal of restoring the child to his parents, to his extended Indian family, or to his tribal community; CYFD failed to actively search for the child's father and prepare him to reunite with the child, it failed to contact and obtain assistance from the child's tribe, it failed to provide any assistance to the child's guardians in freeing the child for return to a parent or placement with an extended family member, and it offered no evidence to show that it had made active efforts to place the child in the treatment foster care recommended by the residential treatment center where the child had been placed.State ex rel. CYFD v. Eric E., 2024-NMCA-026.\n\nA placement preference exists in favor of a child's relatives over non-relatives, but the preference must be tempered by the best interests of the child involved.— The intended purpose of the Abuse and Neglect Act, 32A-4-1 to 32A-4-35 NMSA 1978 in addition to making decisions in the child's best interests and providing due process to all involved parties, is to preserve the unity of the family, and therefore once a child is placed in the custody of the children, youth and families department, and a court has made a finding of abuse or neglect, a placement preference with qualified relatives is triggered, which remains the case for any future permanency changes involving the child. The law also supports, however, the notion that the preference must be tempered by the best interests of the child involved and therefore, there may be circumstances in which a court could reasonably conclude that a non-relative foster parent with whom a child is living and has an emotionally significant relationship may and should be given preference over a relative.Foster Parent Placement Preference(7/1/22), Att'y Gen.

In determining whether good cause exists for deviating from the placement preferences, a court is required to examine the reasons for deviation in light of the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community. The court must give primary consideration to the children's best interests, but must ensure that the constitutional and other legal rights of all the parties are considered. The party seeking to deviate from the placement preferences bears the burden of establishing the existence of good cause to do so.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v.

Any other information available to the professional designated by the department to perform the court-ordered evaluation or treatment shall not be the subject of any application or order for immunity.\n\nE. All immunized statements referred to in Subsection C that are subsequently reduced to writing shall be deleted before any report is released to law enforcement officers or district attorneys.\n\nF. Use immunity orders shall not be entered nunc pro tunc.\n\nG. The children's court attorney shall request a hearing on any application for immunity and shall give at least forty-eight hours notice to all parties and to the district attorney for the county in which the alleged abuse or neglect occurred. The district attorney shall have standing to object to the order for immunity.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-4-11, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 105.",

At any stage of a proceeding under the Abuse and Neglect Act, the court shall have the power and authority to issue orders to compel the appearance of witnesses, the giving of testimony and production of evidence by witnesses, including any party. Production of evidence includes an order to a respondent to undergo a psychological diagnostic evaluation and treatment.\n\nB.

Contempts of court can be civil or criminal, and the major factor in determining how to classify a particular contempt is the purpose for which the power is exercised. Criminal contempt proceedings are instituted to punish completed acts of disobedience that have threatened the authority and dignity of the court. Civil contempt is remedial in nature and serves to preserve and enforce the rights of private parties to suits and to compel obedience to the orders of the court.State v. ex rel. CYFD v. Mercer-Smith, 2019-NMSC-005,rev'g2015-NMCA-093, 356 P.3d 26.\n\nCourts must exercise contempt power consistent with the purposes of civil or criminal contempt.— Consistent with the various purposes for which a court may exercise its contempt power, a court may impose punitive sanctions for criminal contempt, remedial sanctions for civil contempt, or both. The court may not, however, impose penalties on a person who has not been afforded the protections of the criminal law.State v. ex rel. CYFD v. Mercer-Smith, 2019-NMSC-005,rev'g2015-NMCA-093, 356 P.3d 26.\n\nDistrict court did not exercise its contempt power consistent with purpose of civil contempt.— In a civil contempt proceeding, where the district court found the children, youth and families department (CYFD) in contempt of court for attempting to circumvent the court's order in placing two children that had been adjudicated to be abused, the acts of which effectively eliminated the likelihood of reconciliation between the children and their parents, the district court's order holding CYFD in contempt for violating the placement decision and imposing compensatory damages and costs was an abuse of discretion, because the district court had previously found that CYFD had no duty to support reconciliation and the court had refused the parents' proposed finding that the placements might undermine future prospects for reconciliation between the children and their parents. Because efforts toward reunification and reconciliation were no longer being required by the district court, and were therefore not a goal of any treatment plan, the purpose for which the district court exercised its contempt power was not remedial in nature and therefore cannot be upheld as a valid exercise of civil contempt power.State v. ex rel. CYFD v. Mercer-Smith, 2019-NMSC-005,rev'g2015-NMCA-093, 356 P.3d 26.\n\nDistrict courts have inherent power to sanction for contempt.— The district court has inherent power to sanction for contempt. The contempt power is necessary to allow courts to regulate their docket, promote judicial efficiency, and deter frivolous filings, and it has long been recognized that a court must be able to command the obedience of litigants and their attorneys if it is to perform its judicial functions.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't. v. Mercer-Smith, 2015-NMCA-093, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nThe district court properly invoked its inherent power to sanction for contempt where the children, youth and families department (CYFD), in an abuse and neglect case involving foster placement of children, engaged in activity and took direct actions that were in contempt of the district court's placement order and where parents suffered injuries caused by CYFD's contemptuous conduct, including past and future emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and psychological expenses.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't. v. Mercer-Smith, 2015-NMCA-093, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nCivil contempt distinguished from criminal contempt.— Contempts procedurally are either civil or criminal in nature. Where the primary purpose is to preserve the court's authority and to punish for disobedience of its orders, the contempt is criminal. Where the primary purpose is to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with an order, the contempt is civil. The elements necessary for a finding of civil contempt are (1) knowledge of the court's order, and (2) an ability to comply. Intent is not an essential element of contempt, but because knowledge of the district court's order is a prerequisite to contempt, the district court's order must not be ambiguous.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't. v. Mercer-Smith, 2015-NMCA-093, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nSufficient evidence to support court's finding of contemptuous conduct.— Where the children, youth and families department (CYFD) defied a placement order issued by the district court in an abuse and neglect case involving foster placement of two children (children) in the custody of CYFD, the evidence was sufficient to support the district court's findings that CYFD engaged in activity and took direct actions that were in contempt of the placement order where evidence was presented that the placement order prohibited CYFD from placing children with their former counselors from a group home where the children were receiving treatment, because the district court was concerned that placement of the children with their former counselors created dual relationships that are forbidden by the code of ethics for counselors and therapists due to the risk of the therapists confusing their roles in children's lives, that the limitations in the placement order issued by the district court were understood by CYFD, that CYFD nevertheless arranged for children to spend the majority of their waking hours either in school or with the former counselors, and that the amount of contact between the children and the former counselors was tantamount to placement in the counselors' homes, thus violating the placement order.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't. v. Mercer-Smith, 2015-NMCA-093, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nDamages for civil contempt.— Compensatory damages for civil contempt serve to make reparation to the injured party and restore the parties to the position they would have held had the court's order been obeyed. The district court does not have discretion to deny compensatory damages if established with reasonable certainty.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't. v. Mercer-Smith, 2015-NMCA-093, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nWhere district court found that the parents of two children in the custody of the children, youth and families department satisfied their burden of proving a violation of a court order, proximate cause, and damages, the parents were entitled to judgment for recovery of those damages.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't. v. Mercer-Smith, 2015-NMCA-093, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nSufficient evidence to support district court's award of damages for civil contempt.— Where the children, youth and families department (CYFD) defied a placement order issued by the district court in an abuse and neglect case involving foster placement of two children (children) in the custody of CYFD, the evidence was sufficient to support the district court's award of damages to compensate children's parents for damage done to their chances of reconciliation with their daughters, where the evidence established that reconciliation between the children and parents was a goal and that that there were viable prospects for reconciliation prior to the placement order, that an expert in psychology submitted a letter to the district court prior to the placement hearing, and later admitted at the damages hearing, stating that any possibility of future reconciliation with the children and their parents would be significantly lessened if they were to reside with the children's former counselors, that CYFD nevertheless arranged for children to spend the majority of their waking hours either in school or with the former counselors, an amount of contact that was tantamount to placement in the counselors' homes, and that the parents of children suffered injuries and other harms caused by CYFD's contemptuous conduct, including past and future emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life and psychological expenses.State ex rel.

The ICWA regulations and the legislative history of ICWA require remedial active efforts be made prior to initiating a placement and must be designed to prevent having to take a child into state custody. The definition of active efforts focuses on the timeliness of those efforts, provides that they be directed to maintaining the Indian child with their family, or, if a separation has already occurred, reuniting the child with their family, and specifies that efforts be conducted, to the maximum extent possible, in partnership with the Indian child's tribe and extended family.

When the adjudicatory hearing on any petition is not commenced within the time period specified in Subsection A of this section or within the period of any extension granted, the petition shall be dismissed with prejudice.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-4-19, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 113; 1997, ch. 34, § 3; 2009, ch. 239, § 39.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection A, after \"sixty days after the\", deleted \"latest of the following dates:\"; deleted Paragraphs (1) through (3) of Subsection A, which listed: the date the petition is served on the respondent; the date the trial court orders a mistrial or a new trial; and the date a mandate in an appeal or order disposing of the appeal is filed; and added \"date of service on the respondent\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective July 1, 1997, substituted \"sixty days\" for \"ninety days\" in the introductory paragraph of Subsection A, added Subsection B, and redesignated former Subsections B and C as Subsections C and D.\n\nRule 10-343 NMRA controls dismissal for failure to meet time limitations.— Section 32A-4-19 NMSA 1978 is procedural. Rule 10-343 NMRA, which allows the court discretion to dismiss for the failure to meet time limit requirements, prevails over Section 32A-4-19 NMSA 1978.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Arthur C., 2011-NMCA-022, 149 N.M. 472, 251 P.3d 729.\n\nFailure to timely adjudicate petition.— Where the children, youth and families department (CYFD) filed an abuse and neglect petition alleging that mother was homeless and had left child in father's care, that mother tested positive for certain controlled substances, and that the conditions in father's home were dangerous, and where there was reason to know that the child was an Indian child as set forth in the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901-1963, the district court did not err in granting parents' motion to dismiss the case with prejudice for failure to timely commence the adjudicatory hearing or in denying CYFD's motion for an extension of time, because this section mandates that adjudicatory hearings be commenced within sixty days from the date parents are served with an abuse and neglect petition, and the oral motion to dismiss occurred more than 100 days after parents were served; Rule 10-343 NMRA does not allow the district court to consider a motion for an extension after the ten-day grace period has expired.State ex rel. CYFD v. Tanisha G., 2019-NMCA-067.\n\nViolation of federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978.— Where the parent, who was a member of the Navajo nation, consented at a temporary custody hearing to the temporary custody of the child by CYFD; in the temporary custody order, the parent stipulated to a finding that clear and convincing evidence existed to believe that continued custody of the child by the parent or a guardian was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child; the parent contested CYFD's permanent custody of the child at the adjudicatory hearing; CYFD did not put on any evidence to establish that continued custody of the child by the parent or an Indian custodian was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child as required by the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901-1963 (2006), at either the temporary custody hearing or at the adjudicatory hearing, the adjudication of neglect was not based on sufficient evidence.State of N.M. ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Marlene C., 2009-NMCA-058, 146 N.M. 588, 212 P.3d 1142,aff'd,State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Marlene C., 2011-NMSC-005, 149 N.M. 315, 248 P.3d 863.\n\nFindings required at adjudication stage.— In a contested adjudication to which ICWA [Indian Child Welfare Act] applies, the district court must always make the findings of fact required under § 1912(d) and (e) of ICWA at the adjudication stage, founded either on evidence of record or admissions supported by a factual basis.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Marlene C., 2011-NMSC-005, 149 N.M. 315, 248 P.3d 863.\n\nWitnesses qualified as experts for purposes of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act.— A qualified expert witness for Indian Child Welfare Act purposes must be qualified to testify regarding serious damage to the child, but need not necessarily be qualified to testify about cultural standards of the particular tribe if such expertise is irrelevant to the particular circumstances at issue in the proceeding.State ex rel. CYFD v. Douglas B. and State ex rel. CYFD v. Sara E., 2022-NMCA-028, cert. granted.\n\nStandard of review to be applied to a district court's decision to qualify an expert for Indian Child Welfare Act purposes.— The appropriate standard of review to be applied to a district court's decision to qualify and admit the testimony of a qualified expert witness within the meaning of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) is an abuse of discretion standard. ICWA experts are to be evaluated in the same manner as other experts under a given jurisdiction's evidentiary rules.State ex rel. CYFD v. Douglas B. and State ex rel. CYFD v. Sara E., 2022-NMCA-028, cert. granted.\n\nThe district court abused its discretion in qualifying Indian Child Welfare Act expert witness.— In an abuse and neglect case, where the district court adjudicated child as abused and neglected and ordered that child remain in the custody of the children, youth and families department (CYFD) under the care of child's aunt, and where parents claimed that CYFD failed to present a qualified expert witness during the adjudicatory hearing and that the district court committed reversible error by allowing CYFD's proffered expert on the federal Indian Child Welfare Act to testify without the necessary foundation, the district court abused its discretion in qualifying CYFD's witness as an expert for purposes of the ICWA, because although the witness was qualified to testify with respect to the prevailing social and cultural standards of child's tribe, the witness was not qualified to opine as to whether child's continued custody by parents was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. The federal guidelines require ICWA experts to have expertise beyond the normal social worker qualifications and the record does not contain a sufficient foundation establishing that CYFD's witness had the requisite expertise in the areas of substance abuse, domestic violence, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and household hazards, which were the allegations in this case, to opine as to a causal relationship between these particular conditions and the likelihood that continued custody of child will result in serious emotional or physical damage to child.State ex rel. CYFD v. Douglas B. and State ex rel. CYFD v. Sara E., 2022-NMCA-028, cert. granted.\n\nAdjudication of abuse and neglect was error.— In an abuse and neglect case, where the district court adjudicated child as abused and neglected and ordered that child remain in the custody of the children, youth and families department (CYFD) under the care of child's aunt, and where parents claimed that CYFD failed to present a qualified expert witness during the adjudicatory hearing and that the district court committed reversible error by allowing CYFD's proffered expert on the federal Indian Child Welfare Act to testify without the necessary foundation, the district court erred in adjudicating child as abused and neglected where the court applied the wrong legal standard in qualifying CYFD's expert witness and where there was insufficient foundational evidence in the record to uphold the district court's acceptance of CYFD's proffered expert as qualified to issue an opinion as to whether child's continued custody by parents was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage.State ex rel. CYFD v. Douglas B. and State ex rel. CYFD v. Sara E., 2022-NMCA-028, cert. granted.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Incorporating the Law of Criminal Procedure in Termination of Parental Rights Cases: Giving Children a Voice Through Matthews v.

All abuse and neglect hearings shall be closed to the general public.\n\nC. Only the parties, their counsel, witnesses and other persons approved by the court may be present at a closed hearing. The foster parent, preadoptive parent or relative providing care for the child shall be given notice and an opportunity to be heard at the dispositional phase. Those other persons the court finds to have a proper interest in the case or in the work of the court may be admitted by the court to closed hearings on the condition that they refrain from divulging any information that would identify the child or family involved in the proceedings.\n\nD. Accredited representatives of the news media shall be allowed to be present at closed hearings, subject to the condition that they refrain from divulging information that would identify any child involved in the proceedings or the parent, guardian or custodian of that child and subject to enabling regulations as the court finds necessary for the maintenance of order and decorum and for the furtherance of the purposes of the Children's Code. A child who is the subject of an abuse and neglect proceeding and is present at a hearing may object to the presence of the media. The court may exclude the media if it finds that the presence of the media is contrary to the best interests of the child.\n\nE. If the court finds that it is in the best interest of a child under fourteen years of age, the child may be excluded from a hearing under the Abuse and Neglect Act. A child fourteen years of age or older may be excluded from a hearing only if the court makes a finding that there is a compelling reason to exclude the child and states the factual basis for the finding.\n\nF. Those persons or parties granted admission to a closed hearing who intentionally divulge information in violation of this section are guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nG. The court shall determine if the allegations of the petition are admitted or denied. If the allegations are denied, the court shall proceed to hear evidence on the petition. The court, after hearing all of the evidence bearing on the allegations of neglect or abuse, shall make and record its findings on whether the child is a neglected child, an abused child or both. If the petition alleges that the parent, guardian or custodian has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances, then the court shall also make and record its findings on whether the aggravated circumstances have been proven.\n\nH. If the court finds on the basis of a valid admission of the allegations of the petition or on the basis of clear and convincing evidence, competent, material and relevant in nature, that the child is neglected or abused, the court shall enter an order finding that the child is neglected or abused and may proceed immediately or at a postponed hearing to make disposition of the case. If the court does not find that the child is neglected or abused, the court shall dismiss the petition and may refer the family to the department for appropriate services.\n\nI. A party aggrieved by an order entered pursuant to Subsection H of this section may file an immediate appeal to the court of appeals.\n\nJ. In that part of the hearings held under the Children's Code on dispositional issues, all relevant and material evidence helpful in determining the questions presented, including oral and written reports, may be received by the court and may be relied upon to the extent of its probative value even though not competent had it been offered during the part of the hearings on adjudicatory issues.\n\nK. On the court's motion or that of a party, the court may continue the hearing on the petition for a period not to exceed thirty days to receive reports and other evidence in connection with disposition. The court shall continue the hearing pending the receipt of the predisposition study and report if that document has not been prepared and received. During any continuances under this subsection, the court shall make an appropriate order for legal custody.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-4-20, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 114; 1997, ch. 34, § 4; 1999, ch. 77, § 6; 2005, ch. 189, § 46; 2009, ch. 239, § 40; 2014, ch. 69, § 2.\n\nThe 2014 amendment,effective July 1, 2014, provided for immediate appeals as of right from an order of neglect or abuse; in Subsection H, in the first sentence, after \"neglected or abused, the court\", added \"shall enter an order finding that the child is neglected or abused and\"; and added Subsection I.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection D, added the last sentence.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, in Subsection E, provided that a child under fourteen years of age may be excluded from a hearing and that a child fourteen years of age or older may be excluded from a hearing only if there is a compelling reason.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, added the second sentence in Subsection C and the last sentence in Subsection G.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective July 1, 1997, substituted \"period not to exceed thirty days\" for \"reasonable time\" in the first sentence in Subsection J.\n\nStanding to contest dismissal of petition against co-respondent.— A co-respondent does not have standing to contest the dismissal of an abuse and neglect petition against the other co-respondent.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Jeremy N., 2008-NMCA-145, 145 N.M. 198, 195 P.3d 365, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-009, 145 N.M. 257, 196 P.3d 488.\n\nWhere the main issue at the adjudicatory proceeding is the cause of the child's injuriesand where there is an increased risk of an erroneous deprivation of the parent's interest without the appointment of an expert to determine if there is an alternative cause of the child's injuries, an indigent parent is entitled to the appointment of an expert witness at the state's expense.State ex. rel., Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Kathleen D.C., 2007-NMSC-018, 141 N.M. 535, 157 P.3d 714.\n\nQualified expert witness testimony under the federal Indian Child Welfare Act.— The federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) requires, as a procedural safeguard for removal of an Indian child from an Indian family, qualified expert witness (QEW) testimony covering two areas: (1) the likelihood of continued custody by the parent or Indian custodian resulting in serious emotional or physical damage to the child (serious damage) and (2) the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian child's tribe (cultural standards). Courts must independently analyze qualification in the two categories of required QEW testimony under the ICWA, and the testimony can come from one or multiple experts.State ex rel. CYFD v. Douglas B., 2023-NMSC-028,aff'g2022-NMCA-028, 511 P.3d 357.\n\nThe district court did not lay the proper foundation to qualify witness as an expert to testify regarding serious damage to Indian child in abuse and neglect proceedings.— In an abuse and neglect case where the Children, Youth and Families Department (CYFD) received a referral after a Indian child revealed to a source that she was self-harming and wanted to kill herself, and where CYFD took custody of the child and placed her with her paternal aunt, and where, in an adjudicatory hearing to determine whether the child was abused or neglected and whether to keep the child in CYFD custody under the child's aunt's care, the district court qualified CYFD's witness as a qualified expert witness (QEW) pursuant to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, but did not clearly distinguish the witness's qualifications to testify about each of the two categories of QEW testimony required by the ICWA, and where the district court ordered continuing custody by CYFD and that the return of the child to her parents was likely to result in serious harm to the child and was not in the child's best interest, finding that active efforts had been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that such efforts had been unsuccessful, the district court erred in its abuse and neglect adjudication, because serious damage to the child and cultural standards of the Indian child's tribe are subjects requiring QEW testimony, and qualifications of an expert on these subjects must be analyzed independently, and in this case, the district court did not lay the proper foundation required by Rule 11-702 NMRA to qualify CYFD's witness to testify about serious damage to the child and therefore the court abused its discretion in allowing the witnesses to testify on this subject.State ex rel. CYFD v. Douglas B., 2023-NMSC-028,aff'g2022-NMCA-028, 511 P.3d 357.\n\nWitnesses qualified as experts for purposes of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act.— A qualified expert witness for Indian Child Welfare Act purposes must be qualified to testify regarding serious damage to the child, but need not necessarily be qualified to testify about cultural standards of the particular tribe if such expertise is irrelevant to the particular circumstances at issue in the proceeding.State ex rel. CYFD v. Douglas B. and State ex rel. CYFD v. Sara E., 2022-NMCA-028, cert. granted.\n\nStandard of review to be applied to a district court's decision to qualify an expert for Indian Child Welfare Act purposes.— The appropriate standard of review to be applied to a district court's decision to qualify and admit the testimony of a qualified expert witness within the meaning of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) is an abuse of discretion standard. ICWA experts are to be evaluated in the same manner as other experts under a given jurisdiction's evidentiary rules.State ex rel. CYFD v. Douglas B. and State ex rel. CYFD v. Sara E., 2022-NMCA-028, cert. granted.\n\nThe district court abused its discretion in qualifying Indian Child Welfare Act expert witness.— In an abuse and neglect case, where the district court adjudicated child as abused and neglected and ordered that child remain in the custody of the children, youth and families department (CYFD) under the care of child's aunt, and where parents claimed that CYFD failed to present a qualified expert witness during the adjudicatory hearing and that the district court committed reversible error by allowing CYFD's proffered expert on the federal Indian Child Welfare Act to testify without the necessary foundation, the district court abused its discretion in qualifying CYFD's witness as an expert for purposes of the ICWA, because although the witness was qualified to testify with respect to the prevailing social and cultural standards of child's tribe, the witness was not qualified to opine as to whether child's continued custody by parents was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.

CYFD v. Douglas B. and State ex rel. CYFD v. Sara E., 2022-NMCA-028, cert. granted.\n\nAdjudication of abuse and neglect was error.— In an abuse and neglect case, where the district court adjudicated child as abused and neglected and ordered that child remain in the custody of the children, youth and families department (CYFD) under the care of child's aunt, and where parents claimed that CYFD failed to present a qualified expert witness during the adjudicatory hearing and that the district court committed reversible error by allowing CYFD's proffered expert on the federal Indian Child Welfare Act to testify without the necessary foundation, the district court erred in adjudicating child as abused and neglected where the court applied the wrong legal standard in qualifying CYFD's expert witness and where there was insufficient foundational evidence in the record to uphold the district court's acceptance of CYFD's proffered expert as qualified to issue an opinion as to whether child's continued custody by parents was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage.State ex rel. CYFD v. Douglas B. and State ex rel. CYFD v. Sara E., 2022-NMCA-028, cert. granted.\n\nDepartmental custody continued until final determination made.— In a proceeding on an abuse and neglect petition filed by the children, youth and families department, the trial court had authority to continue custody of the children in the Department until determination of proper placement, and the Children's Court had authority under Subsection J to make necessary findings and conclusions with regard to the father's fitness to be a legal custodian.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. A.H., 1997-NMCA-118, 124 N.M. 244, 947 P.2d 1064.\n\nAuthority of court to exclude media.— Even though the conditioning of media access on a requirement that the press refrain from divulging information that would identify a child, parent, guardian, or custodian, could not be met in a highly publicized child abuse and neglect case, the children's court was within its discretion under Subsection D to decide whether to allow the media to attend the proceedings.Albuquerque Journal v. Jewell, 2001-NMSC-005, 130 N.M. 64, 17 P.3d 437.\n\nHearsay statements.— Admission of child's hearsay statements did not violate parents' constitutional rights to due process at the adjudicatory hearing where parents received proper notice of department's intent to use the child's statements, they were each represented by able attorneys who argued vigorously on their behalf and carefully cross-examined department's witnesses about the reliability and credibility of the child's statements, and a guardian ad litem had been appointed for the child.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dept. v. Frank G., 2005-NMCA-026, 137 N.M. 137, 108 P.3d 543,aff'd, 2006-NMSC-019, 139 N.M. 459, 134 P.3d 746.\n\nFinal appealable order.— Abuse and neglect adjudication is a final, appealable order.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dept. v. Frank G., 2005-NMCA-026, 137 N.M. 137, 108 P.3d 543,aff'd, 2006-NMSC-019, 139 N.M. 459, 134 P.3d 746.\n\nJurisdiction pending appeal.— While appeal of abuse and neglect adjudication is pending, the children's court has jurisdiction to take further action in the case.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dept. v. Frank G., 2005-NMCA-026, 137 N.M. 137, 108 P.3d 543,aff'd, 2006-NMSC-019, 139 N.M. 459, 134 P.3d 746.\n\nDoctrine of claim preclusion inapplicable to non-adversarial administrative child abuse investigation.— Where plaintiff challenged, on res judicata grounds, the children, youth and families department's (CYFD) authority to conduct a child protective services investigation and to issue investigative decisions against him after agreeing to dismiss plaintiff from abuse and neglect proceedings with prejudice, the doctrine of claim preclusion did not apply to the substantiation investigation, which is a non-adversarial administrative investigation conducted by a CYFD employee, because it would have been contrary to law for CYFD to carry out its non-adversarial substantiation investigation and documentation requirements during an adversarial proceeding in children's court.State ex rel.

If the court finds that reasonable efforts in these areas have not been made, the court may make supplemental orders as necessary and may reconsider the matter at the initial judicial review and subsequent periodic review hearings;\n\n(7) whether consideration has been given to the child's familial identity and connections;\n\n(8) whether there exists a relative of the child or other individual who, after study by the department, is found to be qualified to receive and care for the child;\n\n(9) the availability of services recommended in the case plan prepared as a part of the predisposition study in accordance with the provisions of Section 32A-4-21 NMSA 1978;\n\n(10) the ability of the parent to care for the child in the home so that no harm will result to the child;\n\n(11) whether reasonable efforts were made by the department to prevent removal of the child from the home prior to placement in substitute care and whether reasonable efforts were made to attempt reunification of the child with the natural parent; and\n\n(12) whether reasonable efforts were made by the department to place siblings in custody together, unless such joint placement would be contrary to the safety or well-being of any of the siblings in custody, and whether any siblings not jointly placed have been provided reasonable visitation or other ongoing interaction, unless visitation or other ongoing interaction would be contrary to the safety or well-being of any of the siblings.\n\nB. If a child is found to be neglected or abused, the court may enter its judgment making any of the following dispositions to protect the welfare of the child:\n\n(1) permit the child to remain with the child's parent, guardian or custodian, subject to those conditions and limitations the court may prescribe;\n\n(2) place the child under protective supervision of the department; or\n\n(3) transfer legal custody of the child to one of the following:\n\n(a) the noncustodial parent, if it is found to be in the child's best interest; or\n\n(b) the department.\n\nC. If a child is found to be neglected or abused, in its dispositional judgment the court shall also order the department to implement and the child's parent, guardian or custodian to cooperate with any case plan approved by the court. Reasonable efforts shall be made to preserve and reunify the family, with the paramount concern being the child's health and safety. The court may determine that reasonable efforts are not required to be made when the court finds that:\n\n(1) the efforts would be futile; or\n\n(2) the parent, guardian or custodian has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances.\n\nD. Any parent, guardian or custodian of a child who is placed in the legal custody of the department or other person pursuant to Subsection B of this section shall have reasonable rights of visitation with the child as determined by the court, unless the court finds that the best interests of the child preclude any visitation.\n\nE. The court may order reasonable visitation between a child placed in the custody of the department and the child's siblings or any other person who may significantly affect the child's best interest, if the court finds the visitation to be in the child's best interest.\n\nF. Unless a child found to be neglected or abused is also found to be delinquent, the child shall not be confined in an institution established for the long-term care and rehabilitation of delinquent children.\n\nG. When the court vests legal custody in an agency, institution or department, the court shall transmit with the dispositional judgment copies of the clinical reports, the predisposition study and report and any other information it has pertinent to the care and treatment of the child.\n\nH. Prior to a child being placed in the custody or protective supervision of the department, the department shall be provided with reasonable oral or written notification and an opportunity to be heard. At any hearing held pursuant to this subsection, the department may appear as a party.\n\nI. When the court determines pursuant to Subsection C of this section that no reasonable efforts at reunification are required, the court shall conduct, within thirty days, a permanency hearing as described in Section 32A-4-25.1 NMSA 1978. Reasonable efforts shall be made to implement and finalize the permanency plan in a timely manner.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-4-22, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 116; 1997, ch. 34, § 6; 1999, ch. 77, § 7; 2005, ch. 189, § 47; 2009, ch. 239, § 42; 2016, ch. 54, § 6; 2022, ch. 41, § 51.\n\nCross references.— For the federal Indian Child Welfare Act,see25 U.S.C. § 1901.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective July 1, 2022, removed provisions related to Indian children which are now covered by the Indian Family Protection Act; in Subsection A, deleted Paragraph A(13); and deleted former Subsection I and redesignated former Subjection J as Subsection I.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2022, ch. 41, § 73 provided that the provisions of Laws 2022, ch. 41 apply to all cases filed on or after July 1, 2022.\n\nThe 2016 amendment,effective May 18, 2016, required the children's court to include in its findings on disposition whether reasonable efforts to identify and locate grandparents and other relatives have been made and whether consideration has been given to the child's familial identity and connections; in Subsection A, added new Paragraphs (6) and (7) and redesignated the succeeding paragraphs accordingly, in Paragraph (9), after \"recommended in the\", deleted \"treatment\" and added \"case\", in Paragraph (11), after each occurrence of \"efforts were\", deleted \"used\" and added \"made\", and in Paragraph (13), after \"the Indian child's\", deleted \"treatment\" and added \"case\"; in Subsection B, Paragraph (3), after \"the child to\", deleted \"any\" and added \"one\", in Subparagraph B(3)(a), after the semicolon, added \"or\", deleted Subparagraphs B(3)(b) and (c) and added new Subparagraph B(3)(b); and in Subsection C, in the introductory paragraph, after \"cooperate with any\", deleted \"treatment\" and added \"case\".\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, added Paragraph (10) of Subsection A\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, in Subsection A(4), changed \"his custodian\" to \"the child's placement\"; and deleted former Subsection C(3), which provided that the court may determine that reasonable efforts are not required to preserve and reunify the family if the parental rights of the parent to a sibling of the child have been terminated involuntarily.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, in Subsection C, added the last two sentences in the introductory language and added Paragraphs (1) through (3); and added Subsection J.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective July 1, 1997, added the first sentence in Subsection A, substituted \"32A-4-21\" for \"32-4-19\" in Paragraph A(7) and made minor stylistic changes in Paragraph A(9) and Subparagraph B(3)(a).\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-34 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nDismissal of proceedings as to one parent.— Where the district court determined that the mother had abused her child; the court dismissed abuse and neglect proceedings against the father; the court determined that placement of the child with the father was in the best interests of the child, the CYFD ceased to have the authority to maintain custody of the child and the mother did not have a liberty interest in continuing the course of her treatment program with the CYFD.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Lisa A., 2008-NMCA-087, 144 N.M. 324, 187 P.3d 189.\n\nGrandparent visitation rights.— The Abuse and Neglect Act does not grant a grandparent unfettered visitation, particularly after an adoption proceeding has occurred.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Senaida C., 2008-NMCA-007, 143 N.M. 335, 176 P.3d 324.\n\nStandard of review.The district court did not err when it used the arbitrary and capricious standard to review CYFD's denial of a grandmother's right of placement.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Senaida C., 2008-NMCA-007, 143 N.M. 335, 176 P.3d 324.\n\nMootness.— In adjudications of neglect or abuse, because the issue of sufficiency of the evidence is capable of repetition, but may evade appellate review, the appeal of an abuse or neglect adjudication challenging the sufficiency of the evidence is not rendered moot by the district court's dismissal of the underlying case while the adjudication is on appeal.State ex rel., Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Amanda H., 2007-NMCA-029, 141 N.M. 299, 154 P.3d 674.\n\nNo unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.— Since the provisions relating to the meaning of \"neglected child\" are to be defined and applied by a court and not the department of human services, there is no unconstitutional, standardless delegation of legislative power to a state agency.State ex rel. Health & Soc. Servs. Dep't v. Natural Father, 1979-NMCA-090, 93 N.M. 222, 598 P.2d 1182.\n\nCourt can make child its ward before further disposition.— District court could make a child which it found to be dependent and neglected its ward and thereafter make such disposition of the child as in its considered judgment was in the child's best interests.N.M. Dep't of Pub. Welfare v. Cromer, 1948-NMSC-046, 52 N.M. 331, 197 P.2d 902.\n\nCourt not bound by any prearranged disposition by agency.— District court was not bound by any prearranged disposition of child by the department of public welfare (now health care authority department) since placement in any home was to be with consent of the court, and the welfare of the child was the court's paramount consideration.N.M. Dep't of Pub. Welfare v. Cromer, 1948-NMSC-046, 52 N.M. 331, 197 P.2d 902.\n\nAdoption proceeding may not be circumvented.— Proceedings to determine if a child is dependent and neglected may not be used to circumvent an adoption proceeding, but where the court has announced its decision denying the petition to adopt, the welfare and best interest of the child are of paramount consideration.Herman v. McIver, 1959-NMSC-055, 66 N.M. 36, 341 P.2d 457.\n\nParental right to custody can be taken away.— The state's claim that parental rights to custody of a child in need of supervision cannot be taken away absent a showing of incompetence on the part of the parent or parents is an overly narrow reading of this statute, which makes no such requirement.In re Doe, 1975-NMCA-131, 88 N.M. 505, 542 P.2d 1195.\n\n\"Reasonable efforts\".— Sections 32A-4-2C, 32A-4-22C, 32A-4-28B(2) NMSA 1978 are constitutional facially and as applied to a mother, whose parental rights were terminated without the state making reasonable efforts toward family reunification, where the mother had previously had parental rights terminated as to another child and no progress was evident in the mother's efforts to kick a 4-year drug abuse problem.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Amy B., 2003-NMCA-017, 133 N.M. 136, 61 P.3d 845.\n\nEnrollment of a child as a member of an Indian tribe.— Where the department filed an abuse and neglect petition and sought to terminate the parent's parental rights to three children, prior to trial, the department was aware that the parent and the children were eligible for enrollment in the Navajo Nation, that the parent had undertaken efforts to enroll the parent and the children, and that the parent was delayed in the enrollment process due to unique circumstances; the department made no efforts to facilitate the enrollment of the children; prior to trial, the parent requested a continuance to permit the parent to complete the enrollment process; and the district court denied the continuance on the ground that the parent and the children were not enrolled in the Navajo Nation and subsequently terminated the parent's parental rights, the district court erred in terminating the parent's parental rights before the department had fulfilled its obligations under Subsection I of Section 32A-4-22 NMSA 1978 to pursue the enrollment of the children in the Navajo Nation.State ex rel. CYFD v. Marsalee P., 2013-NMCA-062, 302 P.3d 761.\n\nDepartment's duty to investigate whether a child in its custody is eligible for enrollment as a member of an Indian tribe.— In termination of parental rights proceeding, the children, youth and families department (CYFD) complied with the mandate of 32A-4-22(I) NMSA 1978, where CYFD attempted to obtain evidence on mother's genealogy, had many conversations with mother to gather information on her lineage in which mother was not cooperative, requested mother's birth certificate on numerous occasions, but mother failed to produce the document, attempted to obtain mother's birth certificate through a state agency, unsuccessfully attempted to retrieve father's birth certificate and certificate of Indian blood from father and paternal grandmother, contacted the vital records department of the Navajo Nation, and worked with other entities within the Navajo Nation and the southern Ute tribe to determine if children were eligible for enrollment as a member of an Indian tribe.State ex rel. CYFD v. Nathan H., 2016-NMCA-043, cert. denied.\n\nCourt vested with broad discretion in placement of minors.— The court did not violate the spirit and intent of the Children's Code by placing a 16-year-old girl in the custody of a woman who had helped to rear her and had been found to be a positive influence over her where the child felt compelled to run away from her mother's household and would in all likelihood continue to refuse to live with her mother since the children's court is vested with a broad discretion in hearing and deciding matters under it.In re Doe, 1975-NMCA-131, 88 N.M. 505, 542 P.2d 1195.\n\nEffect of agency not studying qualifications of individual awarded custody.— Contentions that no agency designated by the court had made a study of the qualifications of the woman awarded custody of a 16-year-old girl in need of supervision were never raised at the probation revocation hearing, and in awarding custody the court impliedly found the woman qualified to have custody of the girl.In re Doe, 1975-NMCA-131, 88 N.M. 505, 542 P.2d 1195.\n\nCounsel of record entitled to notice of subsequent termination action.— The human services department [health care authority department] was required to serve a parent's attorney with notice of the department's action to terminate parental rights, when the attorney was representing him in a separate neglect action before the children's court.Ronald v. State ex rel. Human Servs. Dep't, 1990-NMSC-071, 110 N.M. 454, 797 P.2d 243.\n\nAdoption of child requires notice to parents.— It is impossible to declare a child to be dependent and neglected and then place the child for adoption without notice to the parents. 1959 Op.

Any child in department custody who is placed for residential treatment or habilitation pursuant to the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act shall remain in the legal custody of the department while in residential treatment or habilitation or until further order of the court.\n\nD. A court hearing for consideration of an involuntary placement of a child for residential treatment or habilitation, when the child is subject to the provisions of the Abuse and Neglect Act, may be heard by the court as part of the abuse or neglect proceedings or may be heard in a separate proceeding. All parties to the abuse or neglect proceedings shall be provided with notice of the involuntary placement hearing.\n\nE. A guardian ad litem appointed pursuant to the Abuse and Neglect Act shall serve as a guardian ad litem for a child for the purposes of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act.

When a child is subject to the provisions of the Abuse and Neglect Act and is receiving residential treatment or habilitation services, any documentation required pursuant to the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act shall be filed with the court as part of the abuse or neglect proceeding. A review of the child's placement in a residential treatment or habilitation program shall occur in the same manner and within the same time requirements as provided in the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act.\n\nG. The clerk of the court shall maintain a separate section within an abuse or neglect file for documents pertaining to actions taken under the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act.\n\nH.

At the first judicial review, the department shall report the child's immigration status to the court. Services to children alleged to have been abused, neglected or abandoned must be provided without regard to the immigration status of the child except where immigration status is explicitly set forth as a statutory or regulatory condition of coverage or eligibility.\n\nB. If the child is an undocumented immigrant, the department shall include in the treatment plan a recommendation as to whether the permanency plan for the child includes reuniting the child with the child's parents and whether it is in the child's best interest to be returned to the child's country of origin. If the permanency plan does not include reunification and the department does not recommend that the child be returned to the country of origin, the department shall determine whether the child may be eligible for special immigrant juvenile status under federal law.\n\nC. If the child is eligible for special immigrant juvenile status, the department shall move the court for a special immigrant juvenile status order containing the necessary findings to establish that the child meets the criteria for federal special immigrant juvenile status. The department's motion shall include a statement of the express wishes of the child, as expressed by the child or the child's guardian ad litem or attorney.\n\nD. After consultation with the child and the child's guardian ad litem or attorney, the department shall determine whether the child's best interests would be served by the filing of a petition for special immigrant juvenile status and application for adjustment of status and if in the child's best interest, within sixty days after an entry of the special immigrant juvenile status order, the department shall file a petition for special immigrant juvenile status and an application for adjustment of status on behalf of the child.\n\nE. If a petition and application have been filed and the petition and application have not been granted by the time the child reaches eighteen years of age, the court may retain jurisdiction over the case for the sole purpose of ensuring that the child continues to satisfy the requirements for classification as a special immigrant juvenile.\n\nF.

Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\nJurisdiction not lost by expiration of custody order.— Since the children's court had jurisdiction at the beginning of abuse and neglect proceedings, expiration of a temporary custody order did not cause the loss of the court's jurisdiction.Spear v.

Because efforts toward reunification and reconciliation were no longer being required by the district court, and were therefore not a goal of any treatment plan, the purpose for which the district court exercised its contempt power was not remedial in nature and therefore cannot be upheld as a valid exercise of civil contempt power.State v. ex rel.

      "text": "A. The initial judicial review shall be held within sixty days of the disposition. At the initial judicial review, the parties shall demonstrate to the court efforts made to implement the treatment plan approved by the court in its dispositional order. The court shall determine the extent to which the treatment plan has been implemented and make supplemental orders as necessary to ensure compliance with the treatment plan and the safety of the child. Prior to the initial judicial review, the department shall submit a copy of the adjudicatory order, the dispositional order and notice of the initial judicial review to the council. The staff of the council, or an entity contracting with the council, shall review the case. If the staff or contracting entity determines that the case meets the criteria established in council rules, the staff or contracting entity shall designate the case for review by a substitute care review board. A representative of the substitute care review board, if designated, shall be permitted to attend and comment to the court.\n\nB. The court shall conduct subsequent periodic judicial reviews of the dispositional order within six months of the conclusion of the permanency hearing or, if a motion has been filed for termination of parental rights or permanent guardianship, within six months of the decision on that motion and every six months thereafter. Prior to a subsequent periodic judicial review, the department shall submit a progress report to the council or any designated substitute care review board. Prior to any judicial review by the court pursuant to this section, the substitute care review board may review the dispositional order or the continuation of the order and the department's progress report and report its findings and recommendations to the court.\n\nC. Judicial review pursuant to this section may be carried out by either of the following:\n\n(1) a judicial review hearing conducted by the court; or\n\n(2) a judicial review hearing conducted by a special master appointed by the court; provided, however, that the court approve any findings made by the special master.\n\nD.

At the hearing, the department shall show that it has made reasonable effort to implement any treatment plan approved by the court in its dispositional order and shall present a treatment plan consistent with the purposes of the Children's Code [Chapter 32A NMSA 1978] for any period of extension of the dispositional order. The respondent shall demonstrate to the court that efforts to comply with the treatment plan approved by the court in its dispositional order and efforts to maintain contact with the child were diligent and made in good faith. The court shall determine the extent of compliance with the treatment plan and whether progress is being made toward establishing a stable and permanent placement for the child.\n\nF. The Rules of Evidence shall not apply to hearings held pursuant to this section. The court may admit testimony by any person given notice of the hearing who has information about the status of the child or the status of the treatment plan.\n\nG. At the conclusion of any hearing held pursuant to this section, the court shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\nH. Based on its findings at a judicial review hearing held pursuant to Subsection B of this section, the court shall order one of the following dispositions:\n\n(1) dismiss the action and return the child to the child's parent without supervision if the court finds that conditions in the home that led to abuse have been corrected and it is now safe for the return of the abused child;\n\n(2) permit the child to remain with the child's parent, guardian or custodian subject to those conditions and limitations the court may prescribe, including protective supervision of the child by the department;\n\n(3) return the child to the child's parent and place the child under the protective supervision of the department;\n\n(4) transfer or continue legal custody of the child to:\n\n(a) the noncustodial parent, if that is found to be in the child's best interests;\n\n(b) a relative or other individual who, after study by the department or other agency designated by the court, is found by the court to be qualified to receive and care for the child and is appointed as a permanent guardian of the child; or\n\n(c) the department, subject to the provisions of Paragraph (6) of this subsection;\n\n(5) continue the child in the legal custody of the department with or without any required parental involvement in a treatment plan; provided that reasonable efforts shall be made to preserve and reunify the family, with the paramount concern being the child's health and safety unless the court finds that such efforts are not required. The court may determine that reasonable efforts are not required to be made when the court finds that:\n\n(a) the efforts would be futile; or\n\n(b) the parent, guardian or custodian has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances;\n\n(6) make additional orders regarding the treatment plan or placement of the child to protect the child's best interests if the court determines the department has failed in implementing any material provision of the treatment plan or abused its discretion in the placement or proposed placement of the child; or\n\n(7) if during a judicial review the court finds that the child's parent, guardian or custodian has not complied with the court-ordered treatment plan, the court may order:\n\n(a) the child's parent, guardian or custodian to show cause why the parent, guardian or custodian should not be held in contempt of court; or\n\n(b) a hearing on the merits of terminating parental rights.\n\nI. Dispositional orders entered pursuant to this section shall remain in force for a period of six months, except for orders that provide for transfer of the child to the child's noncustodial parent or to a permanent guardian.\n\nJ. When the court determines, pursuant to Paragraph (5) of Subsection H of this section, that no reasonable efforts at reunification are required, the court shall conduct, within thirty days, a permanency hearing as described in Section 32A-4-25.1 NMSA 1978. The department shall make reasonable efforts to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with the permanency plan and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-4-25, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 119; 1995, ch. 206, § 24; 1997, ch. 34, § 7; 1999, ch. 77, § 8; 2005, ch. 189, § 49; 2009, ch. 239, § 45; 2016, ch. 60, § 2; 2022, ch. 41, § 52.\n\nCompiler's note.— This section was enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 119 as 32-4-23 NMSA 1978.

      "text": "A. A permanency hearing shall be commenced within six months of the initial judicial review of a child's dispositional order or within twelve months of a child entering foster care pursuant to Subsection D [E] of this section, whichever occurs first. Prior to the initial permanency hearing:\n\n(1) the department shall submit a copy of any continuation of the dispositional order and notice of hearing to the council or any substitute care review board designated pursuant to Section 32A-8-5 NMSA 1978;\n\n(2) the department shall submit a progress report to any designated substitute care review board;\n\n(3) all parties to the hearing shall attend a mandatory meeting and attempt to settle issues attendant to the permanency hearing and develop a proposed treatment plan that serves the child's best interest; and\n\n(4) any designated substitute care review board may review the child's case and the department's progress report and report its findings and recommendations to the court.\n\nB. At the permanency hearing, all parties shall have the opportunity to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses. At the conclusion of the permanency hearing, the court shall order one of the following permanency plans for the child:\n\n(1) reunification;\n\n(2) placement for adoption after the parents' rights have been relinquished or terminated or after a motion has been filed to terminate parental rights;\n\n(3) placement with a person who will be the child's permanent guardian;\n\n(4) placement in the legal custody of the department with the child placed in the home of a fit and willing relative; or\n\n(5) placement in the legal custody of the department under a planned permanent living arrangement, provided that there is substantial evidence that none of the above plans is appropriate for the child.\n\nC. If the court adopts a permanency plan of reunification, the court shall adopt a plan for transitioning the child home within a reasonable period depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, but not to exceed six months, and schedule a permanency review hearing within three months. If the child is reunified, the subsequent hearing may be vacated.\n\nD. At the permanency review hearing, all parties and the child's guardian ad litem or attorney shall have the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Based on the evidence, the court shall:\n\n(1) change the plan from reunification to one of the alternative plans provided in Subsection B of this section;\n\n(2) dismiss the case and return custody of the child to the child's parent, guardian or custodian;\n\n(3) continue legal custody of the child in the department to complete a transition home to the child's parent, guardian or custodian and continue the case plan for not more than six months, after which the case shall be dismissed unless the plan is changed as provided in Paragraph (1) of this subsection; or\n\n(4) return the child to the custody of the child's parent, guardian or custodian, subject to any conditions or limitations as the court may prescribe, including protective supervision of the child by the department and continuation of the case plan for not more than six months, after which the case shall be dismissed. The department may seek removal of a child from the home by obtaining an order in the pending case or by seeking emergency removal under Section 32A-4-6 NMSA 1978 during the period of protective supervision if the child's best interest requires such action. When a child is removed in this situation, a permanency hearing shall be scheduled within thirty days of the child coming back into the department's legal custody.\n\nE. The court shall hold a permanency hearing and adopt a permanency plan for a child within twelve months of the child entering foster care. For purposes of this section, a child shall be considered to have entered foster care on the earlier of:\n\n(1) the date of the first judicial finding that the child has been abused or neglected; or\n\n(2) sixty days after the date on which the child was removed from the home.\n\nF. The court shall hold permanency hearings every twelve months when a child is in the legal custody of the department.\n\nG. The children's court attorney shall give notice of the time, place and purpose of any permanency hearing or permanency review hearing held pursuant to this section to:\n\n(1) all parties, including:\n\n(a) the child alleged to be neglected or abused or in need of court-ordered services, by and through the child's guardian ad litem or attorney;\n\n(b) the child's parent, guardian or custodian, who has allegedly neglected or abused the child or is in need of court-ordered services; and\n\n(c) any other person made a party by the court;\n\n(2) the child's foster parent or substitute care provider;\n\n(3) the child's court-appointed special advocate; and\n\n(4) if designated by the council, the substitute care review board.\n\nH. The Rules of Evidence shall not apply to permanency hearings. The court may admit testimony by any person given notice of the permanency hearing who has information about the status of the child or the status of the treatment plan. All testimony shall be subject to cross-examination.\n\nHistory:Laws 1997, ch. 34, § 8; 2005, ch. 189, § 50; 2009, ch. 239, § 46; 2016, ch. 54, § 7; 2016, ch. 60, § 3.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For permanency hearing rules,seeRules 10-345 and 10-346 NMRA.\n\nFor applicability of the Rules of Evidence,seeRule 11-1101 NMRA.\n\nFor the meaning of \"CASA\",see32A-1-4 NMSA 1978.\n\n2016 Multiple Amendments.— Laws 2016, ch. 54, §7 and Laws 2016, ch. 60, § 3 enacted different amendments to this section that can be reconciled. Pursuant to 12-1-8 NMSA 1978, Laws 2016, ch. 60, § 3, as the last act signed by the governor, is set out above and incorporates both amendments.

To view the session laws in their entirety,seethe 2016 session laws onNMOneSource.com.\n\nLaws 2016, ch. 60, § 3, effective July 1, 2016, required the children, youth and families department to submit a copy of the dispositional order and notice of hearing to the substitute care advisory council, submit progress reports and give notice of hearings to any designated substitute care review board; in Subsection A, in the introductory paragraph, after \"Prior to the initial permanency hearing\", deleted \"all parties to the hearing shall attend a mandatory meeting and attempt to settle issues attendant to the permanency hearing and develop a proposed treatment plan that serves the child's best interest. Prior to the initial permanency hearing, the department shall submit a progress report regarding the child to the local substitute care review board for that judicial district. The local substitute care review board may review the child's dispositional order, any continuation of that order\", added new Paragraphs (1) through (3) and designated the remaining language of Subsection A as Paragraph (4), and in Paragraph (4), added \"any designated substitute care review board may review the child's case\"; in Subsection D, after \"The court must ensure\", deleted \"the\" and added \"that\"; and in Subsection H, after \"shall give notice\", deleted the remainder of the sentence, which related to those entitled to notice, and added \"of the time, place and purpose of any permanency hearing or permanency review hearing held pursuant to this section to:\", and added new Paragraphs (1) through (4).\n\nLaws 2016, ch. 54, § 7, effective May 18, 2016, set a six-month limit for transitioning a child home when a permanency plan of reunification is adopted; in Subsection A, after \"develop a proposed\", deleted \"treatment\" and added \"case\"; in Subsection C, after \"transitioning the child home\", added \"within a reasonable period depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, but not to exceed six months\"; deleted former Subsection D and redesignated the succeeding subsections accordingly; and in Subsection D, added new Paragraph (3) and redesignated former Paragraph (3) as Paragraph (4), and in Paragraph (4), after \"continuation of the\", deleted \"treatment\" and added \"case\".\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection A, in the first sentence, changed \"Subsection E\" to \"Subsection D\"; added Subsection D; and in Subsection H, after \"notice to all parties\", added \"including the child by and through\" and after \"guardian ad litem\", added \"or attorney\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, in Subsection A, provided that a permanency hearing shall be held within six month of the initial review of a dispositional order or within twelve months of a child entering foster care pursuant to Subsection E, whichever occurs first; in Subsection B, deleted the former provision which provided that during a permanency hearing, there is a rebuttable presumption that the child's best interest will be served by returning the child to his parent, guardian or custodian; in Subsection B(1) through (5), provided the plans that the court may order at a permanency hearing; deleted former Subsection C, which provided that if the presumption is not rebutted, the court could dismiss the case and return the child to his parent, guardian or custodian or return the child under conditions and limitations prescribed by the court; in Subsection C, provided that if the court orders reunification, the court shall adopt a transition plan and schedule a review hearing; deleted former Subsection D, which provided that if the presumption is rebutted, the court shall order that the child remain in legal custody of the department; in Subsection D(1) through (3), provided the dispositions that the court may make at a permanency review hearing, deleted former Subsection E, which provided that in a subsequent permanency hearing, there shall be a presumption that the child's best interest shall be served by providing for the adoption, emancipation or permanent guardianship of the child; in Subsection E, provided that the court shall adopt a permanency plan within twelve months after the child has entered foster care and provides criteria for determining the date a child enters foster care; deleted former Subsection F, which provided that if the presumption in Subsection E is not rebutted, the court shall order the adoption, emancipation or permanent guardianship of the child and efforts to reunite the child with his parent shall not be attempted; in Subsection F, provided that the court shall hold a permanency hearing every twelve months when a child is in the legal custody of the department; deleted former Subsection G, which provided that if the presumption in Subsection E is rebutted, the court shall dismiss the case and return the child to his parent, guardian or custodian or return the child to his parent, guardian or custodian under conditions and limitations; and in Subsection G, provided that the children's court attorney shall give notice of a permanency review hearing.\n\nPermanency hearings represent a critical stage.State ex rel.

Children, Youth & Families Dep't. v. Maria C., 2004-NMCA-083, 136 N.M. 53, 94 P.3d 796.\n\nFactual basis for termination is largely established at permanency hearing, even though a formal final termination hearing follows.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't. v. Maria C., 2004-NMCA-083, 136 N.M. 53, 94 P.3d 796.\n\nRights of parents at hearing.— Parents have a due process right to fair notice and an opportunity for meaningful participation at the permanency stage, including the right to present evidence and cross examine witnesses, when their presence or additional safeguards would be useful or beneficial to the defense.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't. v. Maria C., 2004-NMCA-083, 136 N.M. 53, 94 P.3d 796.\n\nReunification plan.— Parents do not have an unlimited time to rehabilitate and reunite with their children. State law allows a reunification plan to be maintained for a maximum of fifteen months.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't. v. Maria C., 2004-NMCA-083, 136 N.M. 53, 94 P.3d 796.\n\nIncarcerationcan be the sole legal ground for changing a permanency plan.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't. v. Maria C., 2004-NMCA-083, 136 N.M. 53, 94 P.3d 796.\n\nA parent's absence from permanency hearings did not increase the risk of an erroneous deprivation of parental rights and deny the parent due process where the evidence at the permanency hearings and the termination of parental rights hearing was the same evidence, the parent was sentenced to a term of at least five years in federal prison and the parent had a poor parenting history and a prior incarceration.State ex rel. Children, Youth and Families Dep't v. Maria C., 2004-NMCA-083, 136 N.M. 53, 94 P.3d 796.\n\nA parent who was incarcerated and not present at the termination of parental rights hearing, but who was given the opportunity to participate in the hearing by telephone and who refused to participate in the proceedings by verbalizing profanities towards the judge and then hung up by telephone waived this right to participate in the hearing.State ex rel. Children, Youth and Families Dep't v. Christopher L., 2003-NMCA-068, 133 N.M. 653, 68 P.3d 199.\n\nStanding to appeal placement.— Where the parent's parental rights were terminated; the district court entered a stipulated order that granted the cousin of the parent and the child the status of an intervenor; the order stated the intervenor had a sufficient legal interest to seek consideration as a placement for the child so as to preserve family connections; and the department failed to consider the intervenor as a potential placement, the intervenor had standing to appeal the issue of whether department made reasonable efforts to identify and locate relatives for potential placement of the child.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Laura J., 2013-NMCA-057, 301 P.3d 860, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-003.\n\nStandard for reviewing compliance with the duty to identify and locate relatives for potential placement.— The district court's obligation to inquire into whether the department has complied with its mandate to locate, identify, and consider relatives with whom to place children in its custody is not satisfied by a pro forma ratification of the department's assertions that such efforts have been made or by placing the burden of locating and identifying relatives on the parents of children in departmental custody. Rather, in order to comply with the relative search requirement of Subsection D of Section 32A-2-25.1 NMSA 1978, the court must conclude that the department, through all of its resources, has met its affirmative duty to identify and locate and conduct home studies on any appropriate relative expressing an interest in providing permanency for the child.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Laura J., 2013-NMCA-057, 301 P.3d 860, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-003.\n\nFailure to identify and locate relatives for potential placement.— Where the parent's parental rights were terminated; a cousin of the mother and the child intervened in the proceeding and sought to have the child placed with the intervenor; the intervenor attended meetings at the department and expressed an interest in providing care for the child's half sibling; the intervenor contacted the department about the child; the intervenor was a department-licensed foster parent and the guardian of the child's half sibling; and the department failed to consider placing the child with the intervenor, the department failed to comply with the statutory requirement of Subsection G of Section 32A-4-25.1 NMSA 1978 of making reasonable efforts to place the child with willing and appropriate relatives.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Laura J., 2013-NMCA-057, 301 P.3d 860, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-003.\n\nPreference that a child be placed with relatives.— New Mexico law expresses a preference that any child subject to the New Mexico Abuse and Neglect Act be placed with relatives. The court shall determine whether the children, youth and families department (department) has made reasonable efforts to identify and locate all grandparents and other relatives. The court shall also determine whether the department has made reasonable efforts to conduct home studies on any appropriate relative expressing an interest in providing permanency for the child. The court must ensure the consideration has been given to the child's familial identity and connections.State ex rel. Children, Youth and Families Dep't v. Casey J., 2015-NMCA-088.\n\nWhere Indian children were taken into custody and placed into foster care by the children, youth and families department (department) due to ongoing concerns related to each parent's issues with substance abuse and domestic violence, and where the children's father claimed that the department failed to make reasonable efforts to identify, locate and conduct home studies on willing and appropriate relatives who could potentially serve as placement for children, the district court did not err in finding that the department's efforts to place children with relatives satisfied the requirements of 32A-4-25.1 NMSA 1978, where the evidence established that the department made consistent efforts to honor mother and father's request that the children's aunt be considered as a placement for children, that the department attempted to engage aunt in at least four home studies, but that aunt withdrew from the process each time, and that other relatives had been considered by the department, but that these relatives had been unwilling or unable to provide a suitable placement for children.State ex rel. Children, Youth and Families Dep't v. Casey J., 2015-NMCA-088.\n\nA placement preference exists in favor of a child's relatives over non-relatives, but the preference must be tempered by the best interests of the child involved.— The intended purpose of the Abuse and Neglect Act, 32A-4-1 to 32A-4-35 NMSA 1978 in addition to making decisions in the child's best interests and providing due process to all involved parties, is to preserve the unity of the family, and therefore once a child is placed in the custody of the children, youth and families department, and a court has made a finding of abuse or neglect, a placement preference with qualified relatives is triggered, which remains the case for any future permanency changes involving the child. The law also supports, however, the notion that the preference must be tempered by the best interests of the child involved and therefore, there may be circumstances in which a court could reasonably conclude that a non-relative foster parent with whom a child is living and has an emotionally significant relationship may and should be given preference over a relative.Foster Parent Placement Preference(7/1/22), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2022-05.\n\nViolation of six-month timeline in termination of parental rights case did not constitute fundamental error.— Where child was brought into children, youth and families department (CYFD) custody two months prior to mother pleading no contest to neglecting child due to her domestic violence, substance abuse, and mental health issues, and where, over the next several years, several attempts at visitation between child and mother took place, after which child exhibited negative, and sometimes violent, behavioral issues, and where mother argued that § 32A-4-25.1(D) NMSA 1978 required the district court to dismiss the case, change the permanency plan, or complete a plan to transition home within six months of the initial judicial review, and that the district court committed fundamental error when it failed to take one of these actions until two years after the initial judicial review, when the court changed the permanency plan to adoption, the district court did not commit fundamental error, because even if the court failed to comply with the six-month timeline, the additional time before termination proceedings benefitted mother's defense of termination by giving her additional opportunities to fully comply with her treatment plan and providing additional attempts to reestablish visitation with child. Because the alleged error did not go to the foundation of the case or deprive mother of rights essential to her defense, it did not constitute fundamental error.State ex rel. CYFD v. Josie G., 2021-NMCA-063, cert. denied.",

In proceedings to terminate parental rights, the court shall give primary consideration to the physical, mental and emotional welfare and needs of the child, including the likelihood of the child being adopted if parental rights are terminated.\n\nB. The court shall terminate parental rights with respect to a child when:\n\n(1) there has been an abandonment of the child by the child's parents;\n\n(2) the child has been a neglected or abused child as defined in the Abuse and Neglect Act and the court finds that the conditions and causes of the neglect and abuse are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future despite reasonable efforts by the department or other appropriate agency to assist the parent in adjusting the conditions that render the parent unable to properly care for the child. The court may find in some cases that efforts by the department or another agency are unnecessary, when:\n\n(a) there is a clear showing that the efforts would be futile; or\n\n(b) the parent has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances; or\n\n(3) the child has been placed in the care of others, including care by other relatives, either by a court order or otherwise and the following conditions exist:\n\n(a) the child has lived in the home of others for an extended period of time;\n\n(b) the parent-child relationship has disintegrated;\n\n(c) a psychological parent-child relationship has developed between the substitute family and the child;\n\n(d) if the court deems the child of sufficient capacity to express a preference, the child no longer prefers to live with the natural parent;\n\n(e) the substitute family desires to adopt the child; and\n\n(f) a presumption of abandonment created by the conditions described in Subparagraphs (a) through (e) of this paragraph has not been rebutted.\n\nC. A finding by the court that all of the conditions set forth in Subparagraphs (a) through (f) of Paragraph (3) of Subsection B of this section exist shall create a rebuttable presumption of abandonment.\n\nD. The department shall not file a motion, and shall not join a motion filed by another party, to terminate parental rights:\n\n(1) when the sole factual basis for the motion is that a child's parent is or was formerly incarcerated; or\n\n(2) if the motion is based, to any extent, on the fact that the child is an Indian child or that the child's parent or parents are Indian.\n\nE.

The court shall not waive any time requirements set forth in the Adoption Act [Chapter 32A, Article 5 NMSA 1978] unless the termination of parental rights occurred pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (3) of Subsection B of this section. The court may enter a decree of adoption only after finding that the party seeking to adopt the child has satisfied all of the requirements set forth in the Adoption Act. Unless otherwise stipulated by all parties, an adoption decree shall take effect sixty days after the termination of parental rights, to allow the department sufficient time to provide counseling for the child and otherwise prepare the child for the adoption.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-54 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nApplication of Subsection B.— Subsection (B)(1) is to be used to terminate parental rights by a finding of abandonment where a parent is absent prior to termination. Subsection (B)(2) is to be used where a parent is present and expresses a legitimate desire to take responsibility for a child prior to termination.In the Matter of Grace H., 2014-NMSC-034.\n\nWhere respondent did not receive notice of and did not appear at hearings leading to termination of respondent's parental rights; the district court's permanency order incorporated a family treatment plan for respondent that had a completion date of May 1, 2010; in March 2010, the department filed a motion to terminate respondent's parental rights; in April 2010, one month before the initial termination hearing, when respondent learned that the department had custody of respondent's child, respondent met with the department and told the department that respondent wanted custody of the child; and the district court concluded that respondent had abandoned the child under Subsection (B)(1) as grounds for termination of respondent's parental rights, respondent's parental rights were improperly terminated under Subsection (B)(1) because respondent was entitled to assistance and treatment under Subsection (B)(2).In the Matter of Grace H., 2014-NMSC-034.\n\nImproper application of Subsection B.— In termination of parental rights case, where the record established that father was present prior to the district court's termination and that father expressed a legitimate desire to take responsibility for the child, the district court's use of 32A-4-28(B)(1) NMSA 1978 was improper because 32A-4-28(B)(1) applies only where a parent is absent prior to termination, and conversely, 32A-4-28(B)(2) is to be used where a parent is present and expresses a legitimate desire to take responsibility for a child prior to termination.State ex rel. CYFD v. Alfonso M.E., 2016-NMCA-021.\n\nApplication of Subsection B when CYFD proceeds under two theories.— Subsection B(1) should be used to terminate parental rights where a parent is completely absent prior to termination, while Subsection B(2) should be used where a parent is present and expresses a legitimate desire to take responsibility for a child prior to termination. Where the children, youth and families department proceeds under both theories and there is an adjudication of neglect under Subsection B(2), the application of Subsection B(1) is precluded.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Melvin C., 2015-NMCA-067.\n\nWhere father indicated his desire to reunify with his child and his willingness to work a treatment plan, and where the children, youth and families department stipulated to father's no contest plea to the neglect allegation, the application of Subsection B(1) of this section was inappropriate because the record reflected father's legitimate desire to take responsibility for his child and did not support a finding that father was completely absent.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Melvin C., 2015-NMCA-067.\n\nKinship guardians possess the rights of biological parents.— A kinship guardian appointed under the Kinship Guardianship Act, 40-10B-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., possesses the same legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent and may not be involuntarily dismissed as a party from a termination of parental rights case under the Abuse and Neglect Act, 32A-4-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., without first revoking the kinship guardianship according to the procedures specified in the Kinship Guardianship Act and the rules of evidence, but is not a necessary and indispensable party as defined by Rule 1-019 NMRA.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Djamila B., 2015-NMSC-003.\n\nWhere guardian was appointed by a family court as a kinship guardian pursuant to the Kinship Guardianship Act, 40-10B-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., and where Children, Youth and Families Department (CYFD) brought abuse and neglect proceedings in children's court against guardian and children's biological parents pursuant to the Abuse and Neglect Act, 32A-4-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., the kinship guardian, who possesses the same legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent, must be a party to a termination of parental rights hearing under the Abuse and Neglect Act, but is not a necessary and indispensable party as defined by Rule 1-019 NMRA.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Djamila B., 2015-NMSC-003.\n\nKinship guardian is a necessary and indispensable party.— A kinship guardian under the Kinship Guardianship Act, 40-10B-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., who is named as a respondent in an abuse and neglect proceeding is a necessary and indispensable party in the abuse and neglect case and may not be involuntarily dismissed from the case without first revoking the kinship guardianship according to the procedures specified in the Kinship Guardianship Act.State ex rel. CYFD v. Djamila B., 2014-NMCA-045, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-004.\n\nWhere the guardian was appointed as kinship guardian for the children pursuant to the Kinship Guardianship Act, 40-10B-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.; the children lived with the guardian; the department filed a neglect and abuse petition under the Abuse and Neglect Act, 32A-4-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., against the guardian and the children's parents; the district court adopted the department's permanency plan to reunify the children with the guardian; six months later, the district court changed the permanency plan from reunification to adoption and dismissed the guardian from the proceedings; and the guardian's kinship guardianship had not been revoked pursuant to the Kinship Guardianship Act, because the permanency plan included a proposed adoption, the guardian was a necessary and indispensable party to the abuse and neglect case so long as the guardian's kinship guardianship remained in effect.State ex rel. CYFD v. Djamila B., 2014-NMCA-045, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-004.\n\nBest-interests-of-the-child standard.— The statutory mandate to give primary consideration to the best interests of the child in a proceeding to terminate parental rights does not deny the fundamental interests of the parents in the care, custody and control of the child.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. John R., 2009-NMCA-025, 145 N.M. 636, 203 P.3d 167.\n\nIn abuse and neglect or termination proceedings,translations of court documents and interpreters do not have to be provided as a matter of law to non-English speaking respondents.State ex rel., Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. William M., 2007-NMCA-055, 141 N.M. 765, 161 P.3d 262, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-005, 141 N.M. 762, 161 P.3d 259.\n\nProcedure after adjudication of neglect.— Termination of parental rights may be based on abandonment, abuse or neglect, or presumptive abandonment. After a court makes a finding of neglect in an adjudicatory proceeding, the children, youth and families department has a statutory duty to make reasonable efforts to assist a parent with reunification, and where there is a finding of neglect or abuse under Subsection B(2) of this section, the plain language of the statute requires a dispositional hearing and the creation of a treatment plan therein.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Melvin C., 2015-NMCA-067.\n\nWhere father entered a no contest plea to an allegation of neglect, and the district court entered a finding of neglect, it was error for the district court to proceed with a termination of parental rights hearing based on an allegation of abandonment. Although abuse or neglect and abandonment are separate and independent grounds for the termination of parental rights, where there is a finding of neglect or abuse under Subsection B(2) of this section, the statute requires a dispositional hearing and the creation of a treatment plan therein. The district court, having never acted to assess the propriety of a treatment plan and having never ordered that one be created, erred by failing to fulfill its statutory duties under the adjudication of neglect that it had previously entered as it was required to do by 32A-4-28(B)(2).State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Melvin C., 2015-NMCA-067.\n\nProcedure after reversal of abuse and neglect adjudication.— After an adjudication of abuse and neglect is reversed during termination of parental rights proceedings, the district court, on remand, retains jurisdiction to determine whether the parent prevailing on appeal should regain custody of the child. The court and CYFD must put a transition plan in place to attempt to return the child to the parent. CYFD may seek a termination of parental rights by filing new or current allegations of abuse, neglect or abandonment. To prevail on new allegations, the department must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the prior reversed adjudications and CYFD's own actions did not contribute to the new or current allegations of abuse or neglect against the parent. The court must determine whether the new allegations are supported by clear and convincing evidence. The court must make findings with respect to whether the new allegations are actually a result of the prior adjudication against the parent or whether the allegations actually constitute new incidences of abuse or neglect. If the court does not find clear and convincing evidence of abuse or neglect based on the new allegations, the court must expedite the transition of the child to the parent, putting in place any services or plans that may assist in the transition. If the court determines that there is clear and convincing evidence of new abuse or neglect by the parent, the court must approve a treatment plan for the parent or find that further efforts by CYFD would be futile. If a treatment plan is approved, the court must review compliance with the plan as provided in the Abuse and Neglect Act. If CYFD establishes that further efforts to assist the parent would be futile, then they may seek termination of parental rights.State ex rel., Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Benjamin O., 2007-NMCA-070, 141 N.M. 692, 160 P.3d 601.\n\nLimitation on evidence.— In a termination of parental rights case, where the children, youth and families department's (department) first motion to terminate father's parental rights was denied due to lack of clear and convincing evidence that the statutory requirements for termination had been satisfied, the district court did not err in allowing the department to present evidence of events preceding the first hearing on the first motion to terminate parental rights in a subsequent termination of parental rights hearing, because to ignore all preceding evidence when there is no dispute as to the adjudication of abuse or neglect, which could include a parent's history of compliance, information about the causes and conditions that led to the child being taken into custody, and attempts to alleviate those causes and conditions, would be to limit the district court's access to information that is needed to appropriately assess whether a parent's parental rights should be terminated.State ex rel. CYFD v. William C., Jr., 2017-NMCA-058.\n\nConstitutionality.— A similar statute was not constitutionally defective by failing to provide for a defense of mental illness.In re Jason Y., 1987-NMCA-120, 106 N.M. 406, 744 P.2d 181.\n\nA similar statute was not vague or ambiguous.In re Samantha D., 1987-NMCA-082, 106 N.M. 184, 740 P.2d 1168, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.\n\nNo right to jury trial.— There is no right to a trial by jury in termination of parental rights proceedings provided by either the Children's Code or the state constitution.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. T.J., 1997-NMCA-021, 123 N.M. 99, 934 P.2d 293, cert. denied, 122 N.M. 808, 932 P.2d 498.\n\nEffect of Child Custody Jurisdiction Act.— The former New Mexico Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (nowseeSections 40-10A-101 to 40-10A-403 NMSA 1978) does not supersede or invalidate a proceeding to terminate parental rights.Laurie R. v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 1988-NMCA-055, 107 N.M. 529, 760 P.2d 1295.\n\nApplicability of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act.— In termination of parental rights proceeding, the federal Indian Child Welfare Act did not apply where father failed to show that his children were eligible for membership in an Indian tribe, and therefore did not satisfy the definition of Indian child as set forth in the federal law.State ex rel. CYFD v. Nathan H., 2016-NMCA-043, cert. denied.\n\nApplicability of Americans with Disabilities Act.— Even though the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.) might apply in the context of abandonment under this section if, because of a violation thereof, the parent lacked responsibility for destruction of the parent-child relationship, there was no violation in this case since the mother refused to cooperate or participate voluntarily in treatment plans.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. John D., 1997-NMCA-019, 123 N.M. 114, 934 P.2d 308.\n\nServices provided by CYFD must reasonably accommodate a parent's disability.— Where the Children, Youth and Families Department (CYFD) alleged that the children in this case were neglected due to their mother's intellectual disability, and where, following an adjudicatory hearing, the district court entered an adjudication of neglect based on mother's intellectual disability, which the court found interfered with mother's ability to properly feed, clean and care for her children, and where the district court adopted CYFD's treatment plan and ordered CYFD to comply with the ADA, which directs CYFD to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to provide the parent an equal opportunity to participate in the treatment plan, unless such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program or activity, and where, because of mother's struggles with complying with the treatment plan and upon CYFD's motion, the district court terminated mother's parental rights, the district court erred in finding that CYFD provided reasonable accommodations for mother's intellectual disability in compliance with the ADA and in terminating mother's parental rights, because the state law requirement that CYFD make reasonable efforts to assist a parent incorporates the ADA requirement that the services provided by CYFD reasonably accommodate a parent's disability, and in this case, CYFD failed to incorporate into mother's case plan the district court's orders concerning the accommodations it was required to implement, failed to seek modification of the court's order, and failed to advise the court of its lack of compliance. The district court, therefore, was not fulling informed when it found that CYFD provided reasonable accommodations for mother's intellectual disability in compliance with the ADA and 32A-4-28(B)(2) NMSA 1978.CYFD v. Geneva C., 2023-NMCA-003.\n\nAdequacy of notice when parent represented by counsel.— The human services department [health care authority department] was required to serve a parent's attorney with notice of the department's action to terminate parental rights, when the attorney was representing him in a separate neglect action before the children's court.Ronald v. State ex rel. Human Servs. Dep't, 1990-NMSC-071, 110 N.M. 454, 797 P.2d 243.\n\nAssistance of counsel.— The appointment of one attorney to represent both the mother and father in a proceeding for termination of parental rights may create a conflict of interest for the attorney.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Tammy S., 1999-NMCA-009, 126 N.M. 664, 974 P.2d 158.\n\nEfforts to assist parents.— Because parenting is a fundamental liberty interest, reasonable efforts must be made by the department to assist the parent before parental rights may be terminated.In re Elizabeth H., 2002-NMCA-061, 132 N.M. 299, 47 P.3d 859, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 397, 49 P.3d 76.\n\nReasonable efforts by the department to assist a parent vary with a number of factors, including the level of cooperation demonstrated by the parent and the recalcitrance of the problems that render the parent unable to provide adequate parenting.In re Elizabeth H., 2002-NMCA-061, 132 N.M. 299, 47 P.3d 859, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 397, 49 P.3d 76.\n\nCase law.— The provisions of Section 32A-4-28B NMSA 1978 which permit the court to relieve the state of the burden of engaging in reasonable efforts to assist the parent in adjusting the conditions that render the parent unable to properly care for the child and relieve the state of the burden of proving that such efforts would not result in a change of the conditions and causes of the neglect or abuse are not unconstitutional as denial of a parent's right to due process as a termination of parental rights hearing.State ex rel. Children, Youth and Families Dep't v. Amy B., 2003-NMCA-017, 133 N.M. 136, 61 P.3d 845.\n\nDepartment not required to assist parent where abandonment's effects are unremediable.— Where abandonment by a father is proven, and the results of the father's past conduct are not remediable, the department is not required to show that it has made efforts to assist the father in remedying the problem.State ex rel. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Peterson, 1986-NMSC-001, 103 N.M. 617, 711 P.2d 894, cert. denied, 103 N.M. 525, 710 P.2d 92.\n\nAggravating circumstances relieved the department of the obligation to make efforts to reunify the family.— Where the department filed proceedings to terminate the parent's parental rights to the child; the parent had a chronic illegal drug abuse problem, but never entered or completed a drug treatment plan, never had a home or employment, failed to complete work on a GED, and had been in and out of jail since the beginning of the case; the child had a high level of methamphetamine in the child's system when the child was taken into custody by the department; the parent's parental rights to the child's sibling had previously been terminated; the district court found that there were aggravating circumstances based on the prior termination of the parent's parental rights to the child's sibling, relieved the department of its obligation to make efforts to reunify the family, and terminated the parent's parental rights to the child; the parent's appeal of the prior termination of the parent's parental rights to the child's sibling was pending and unresolved during the neglect and abuse proceeding regarding the child; and the parent claimed that the parent's right to due process had been violated by the district court's finding of aggravated circumstances when the prior termination had not been resolved on appeal, the parent's due process rights were not violated.State ex rel. CYFD v. Raquel M., 2013-NMCA-061, 303 P.3d 865, cert. quashed, 2013-NMCERT-007.\n\nNotice required that parent's relation with partner is a condition of abuse and neglect.— When the behavior of a parent's partner is such that it is difficult for a person of ordinary intelligence and sensibilities to realize that the partner's self-centeredness or other characteristic is harming the child, the department must put the parent on notice that the parent's relation with the partner is a condition and cause of the abuse and neglect of the child and that a continued relation with the partner is grounds for termination of the parent's parental rights in order to satisfy the department's duty to engage in reasonable efforts to assist the parent in adjusting the conditions that render the parent unable to properly care for the child.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Joseph M., 2006-NMCA-029, 139 N.M. 137, 130 P.3d 198.\n\nTermination of parental rights because of neglect or abusedoes not require a prior adjudication of neglect.State ex rel. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Ousley, 1985-NMCA-035, 102 N.M. 656, 699 P.2d 129.\n\nInjury to child not condition precedent.— While a court may not speculate as to the future care of a child, the primary consideration is the best interests and welfare of the child, and the court should not be forced to refrain from taking action until each child suffers an injury. It is not necessary to wait until a child has been injured, since knowingly, intentionally, or negligently placing a child in danger constitutes abuse and is a ground for terminating parental rights.State ex rel. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Tommy A. M., 1987-NMCA-043, 105 N.M. 664, 735 P.2d 1170.\n\nII. PARENTAL RIGHTS.\n\nDue process.— Minimum consideration of due process required court to inquire on the record whether mother waived certain due process rights and failure to do so was fundamental error. A mother was denied due process when her parental rights were terminated at a hearing that she did not attend and at which only a proffer was made of the evidence supporting the termination.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Stella P., 1999-NMCA-100, 127 N.M. 699, 986 P.2d 495.\n\nThe trial court has a responsibility to inquire into whether mother has waived her due process rights. If the parties were not prepared to address the issue, the trial court should have ordered a brief continuance. Such a continuance will give the parties an opportunity to propose arrangements for mother to participate even though she cannot be physically present.State ex rel. Children, Youth, & Families Dep't v. Steven, 1999-NMCA-141, 128 N.M. 304, 992 P.2d 317.\n\nDistrict court's refusal to appoint a guardian ad litem did not violate disabled parent's procedural due process rights.— Where the Children, Youth and Families Department (CYFD) alleged that the children in this case were neglected due to their mother's intellectual disability, and where, following an adjudicatory hearing, the district court entered an adjudication of neglect based on mother's intellectual disability, which the court found interfered with mother's ability to properly feed, clean and care for her children, and where the district court adopted CYFD's treatment plan and ordered CYFD to comply with the ADA, which directs CYFD to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to provide the parent an equal opportunity to participate in the treatment plan, unless such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program or activity, and where, throughout the proceedings, mother's counsel requested that a guardian ad litem be appointed to assist mother in understanding the proceedings, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to appoint a guardian ad litem, because mother was both competent and capable of making decisions with the advice of counsel, and the district court made a series of accommodations for hearings, including allowing family members to attend court with mother and allowing a care provider to confer with mother to clarify the proceedings. Refusing to appoint a guardian ad litem did not deprive mother of due process, and providing other accommodations in the courtroom for mother's disability instead of a guardian ad litem was not an abuse of the court's discretion.CYFD v. Geneva C., 2023-NMCA-003.\n\nSufficient procedural protections of non-English speaking parent.— Father, whose primary language was Spanish, was afforded adequate procedural protections to ensure that he had adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard, where the father was represented by a court-appointed attorney who spoke Spanish and could discuss the case with him; the father appeared by telephone at the adjudicatory hearing and in person at all other in-court proceedings with the assistance of a certified interpreter; CYFD used a Spanish-speaking social worker on occasion to assist in communicating with the father; and the father was apprized of the critical aspects of the case throughout the proceedings by his counsel, the department, and the court.State ex rel., Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. William M., 2007-NMCA-055, 141 N.M. 765, 161 P.3d 262, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-005, 141 N.M. 762, 161 P.3d 259.\n\nDue process rights of parents generally.— Because the right to raise one's child is a fundamental right protected by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, termination proceedings must be conducted in a constitutional manner. As such, a parent's legal relationship with his or her child cannot be severed without due process of law, which requires that termination proceedings be conducted with scrupulous fairness to the parent.State ex rel. Children, Youth and Families Dep't v. Mafin M., 2003-NMSC-015, 133 N.M. 827, 70 P.3d 1266.\n\nParent's due process rights were not violated.— Where petitioner was not given notice or an opportunity to participate in two permanency hearings in an abuse and neglect proceeding; after the court's approval of a permanency plan, the court terminated petitioner's parental rights on the grounds of abandonment; and petitioner claimed that the court erred in terminating petitioner's parental rights without first providing petitioner with notice and an opportunity to participate in the permanency hearings regarding abuse and neglect, which could have altered the court's unchallenged findings of abandonment, petitioner did not suffer an abuse of due process because abuse and neglect are separate and independent grounds for termination of parental rights.State ex rel. CYFD v. Christopher B., 2014-NMCA-016.\n\nWhere the parent claimed that the termination of the parent's parental rights violated due process because the department failed to make reasonable efforts to assist the parent to adjust to the causes and conditions that led to the department taking custody of the child; specifically, the parent claimed that the department created a near-insurmountable obstacle to the parent's adjustment by placing the child in a home in Las Vegas where the case was being managed and by failing to create a treatment plan that accommodated the parent's learning disorder and cognitive limitations; the parent lived on Santa Fe; the department transported the child to Santa Fe twice a week for supervised visits and the parent was provided transportation to Las Vegas for additional visits; the parent was admitted to a residential treatment center where the parent underwent a psychiatric evaluation and a psychosocial assessment; and the department provided individual dialectical behavior therapy and emotional literacy and mindfulness training by a therapist who was aware of the parent's history of ADHD and special education, the department made a reasonable efforts to assist and to accommodate the parent's limitations and the parent was not denied due process.State ex rel. Children, Youth and Families Dep't v. Laura J., 2013-NMCA-057, 301 P.3d 860, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-003.\n\nMother's due process rights were not denied.— Where child was brought into children, youth and families department (CYFD) custody two months prior to mother pleading no contest to neglecting child due to her domestic violence, substance abuse, and mental health issues, and where, over the next several years, several attempts at visitation between child and mother took place, after which child exhibited negative, and sometimes violent, behavioral issues, and where mother argued that she was denied due process because she was excluded from certain proceedings where CYFD acted unilaterally and without judicial oversight and because the district court failed to comply with the six-month timeline set out in § 32A-4-25.1(D) NMSA 1978, mother's due process rights were not violated because mother failed to direct the court to any proceedings where she was not present, where she was unrepresented by counsel, where she was denied the opportunity to cross-examine CYFD's witnesses or present evidence of her own, or where she was denied an impartial decision-maker, and, moreover, mother does not allege that there is a reasonable likelihood that the outcome of the termination proceedings might have been different had CYFD complied with the statutory deadlines it allegedly violated.State ex rel. CYFD v. Josie G., 2021-NMCA-063, cert. denied.\n\nMother's due process rights were not denied where witness's testimony was aided by an outline prepared by attorney.— In a termination of parental rights proceeding, where the permanency planning worker from the children, youth and families department (CYFD) testified that she prepared for her testimony by reading an outline prepared by CYFD's attorney which he emailed to her two days before the hearing, the district court did not err in denying mother's motion to strike the witness's testimony based on a violation of due process, because the outline, created from the witness's family treatment plan and court reports, were part of the record and available to mother's attorney, nothing in the record indicated that the outline or the witness's testimony was inaccurate or incorrect, and the district court sufficiently corrected any alleged impropriety in CYFD's handling of its witnesses by allowing for cross-examination and voir dire of the witness, and therefore the risk to mother of an erroneous deprivation of her parental rights was low.State ex rel. CYFD v. Rosalia M., 2017-NMCA-085.\n\nWitness's testimony aided by an outline prepared by attorney did not result in structural error.— In a termination of parental rights proceeding, where the permanency planning worker from the children, youth and families department (CYFD) testified that she prepared for her testimony by reading an outline prepared by CYFD's attorney which he emailed to her two days before the hearing, the witness's testimony did not render the entire proceeding fundamentally unfair, because the witness only read and relied on the portion of the outline that pertained to her testimony, which was created from her own court reports and family treatment plan, and mother's attorney was provided an opportunity to question and to cross-examine the witness which corrected any alleged impropriety in CYFD's handling of its witnesses.State ex rel. CYFD v. Rosalia M., 2017-NMCA-085.\n\nDue process rights of incarcerated parent in termination hearing.— Because a fundamental liberty interest is implicated in proceedings involving the termination of parental rights, a parent who is incarcerated and is unable to attend a hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights is entitled to procedural due process, including the right to review and challenge the evidence presented against him and to present evidence on his behalf.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Ruth Anne E., 1999-NMCA-035, 126 N.M. 670, 974 P.2d 164.\n\nIncarcerated father's due process rights were not violated where he was given the opportunity to participate in a termination hearing via telephone, despite his insistence that he be physically present in the courtroom.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Christopher L., 2003-NMCA-068, 133 N.M. 653, 68 P.3d 199.\n\nRight of custodians to termination proceedings.— That the nonparent custodians of a child were \"acting as parents\" pursuant to Section 40-10-3H NMSA 1978 (now 40-10A-102(13) NMSA 1978) because they had physical custody of the child and claimed a right to custody did not have applicability in a neglect or abuse case so as to entitle the custodians to the protections afforded in a termination of parent rights case.In re Agnes P., 1990-NMCA-091, 110 N.M. 768, 800 P.2d 202, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 749, 799 P.2d 1121.\n\nPlea of nolo contendere to abuse and neglect charge.— The trial court's taking judicial notice of a mother's nolo contendere plea in a prior abuse and neglect case did not deprive the mother of due process since the court heard testimony and made its findings based on the evidence presented, rather than simply relying on the prior adjudication.State v. Eventyr J., 1995-NMCA-087, 120 N.M. 463, 902 P.2d 1066.\n\nIII. PROOF.\n\nEfforts of the department.— The court is justified in terminating parental rights where it is clear after several years of effort by the department that the child will not thrive, and the causes of neglect and abuse are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.State ex rel. Human Servs. Dep't v. Penny J., 1994-NMCA-143, 119 N.M. 328, 890 P.2d 389, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 20, 888 P.2d 466\n\nEvidence of negect of siblings.— Although child was taken into CYFD custody at the time of birth, and was therefore never in parents' care, the court could rely on evidence of neglect or abuse to the other children as a factor in determining whether parental rights to child should be terminated.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. David F., Sr., 1996-NMCA-018, 121 N.M. 341, 911 P.2d 235, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 242, 910 P.2d 318.\n\nParent's right to raise child to be considered.— While a court must give primary consideration to the physical, mental and emotional welfare and needs of the child, this cannot be done to the utter exclusion of consideration of the rights of a parent to raise her children.State ex rel. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Natural Mother, 1981-NMCA-103, 96 N.M. 677, 634 P.2d 699.\n\nRelative merits of parental environments not considered.— The process of making a determination of termination of parental rights does not include a comparison of the relative merits of the environments provided by the foster parents and by the natural parents. The only consideration is whether the environment provided for the children by the parents is and will be adequate.State ex rel. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Natural Mother, 1981-NMCA-103, 96 N.M. 677, 634 P.2d 699.\n\nThe fact that a child might be better off in a different environment is not a basis for termination of parental rights.State ex rel. Department of Human Servs. v. Williams, 1989-NMCA-008, 108 N.M. 332, 772 P.2d 366 (Ct. App.), cert. denied, 108 N.M. 273, 771 P.2d 981 (1989).\n\nFailure to assist parents.— Where the department's treatment plans treated the parents as a unit with the goal of reunification of the family; one parent failed to make progress toward becoming an adequate parent; the other parent made positive progress; and the department did not provide a specific treatment plan or specifically alert the parent who was progressing of the consequences of staying with the parent who was not progressing, the court erred in terminating the parental rights of the parent who was progressing because there was no clear and convincing evidence that it was unlikely that the parent who was progressing would be able to properly parent the children in the forseeable future.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Joseph M., 2006-NMCA-029, 139 N.M. 137, 130 P.3d 198.\n\nMere comparative analysis of prospective homes is improperin proceedings seeking to terminate parental rights.In re Doe, 1982-NMCA-094, 98 N.M. 340, 648 P.2d 798, cert. deniedsub nom, Cook v. Brownfield, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794.\n\nFutile efforts to preserve family not required.— When it becomes clear that preserving the family is not compatible with protecting the child, further efforts at preservation are not required. Further efforts to assist the parents are not required when there is a clear showing that they would be futile.In re Kenny F., 1990-NMCA-004, 109 N.M. 472, 786 P.2d 699,overruled on other grounds byIn re Adoption of J.J.B., 1993-NMCA-145, 117 N.M. 31, 868 P.2d 1256.\n\nAdvice regarding right to appointed counsel.— A district court must advise a parent in termination proceedings under the adoption provisions of the Children's Code that the parent is entitled to have counsel appointed if indigency can be established. The court's failure to advise a parent that the parent would be entitled to appointed counsel if the parent can establish indigency constitutes fundamental error.Chris L. v. Vanessa O., 2013-NMCA-107.\n\nWhere, in an adoption proceeding, the petitioners sought to terminate the parental rights of the child's biological parent; the parent appeared in the proceeding pro se; the district court told the parent that the parent would be required to follow the rules and that the parent could hire an attorney at any time during the proceedings, but failed to advise the parent that the court would appoint counsel for the parent if the parent was indigent and requested counsel, the failure of the court to advise the parent that the parent would be entitled to appointed counsel if the parent could establish indigency constituted fundamental error.Chris L. v. Vanessa O., 2013-NMCA-107.\n\n\"Reasonable efforts\".— Sections 32A-4-2C, 32A-4-22C, 32A-4-28B(2) NMSA 1978 are constitutional facially and as applied to a mother, whose parental rights were terminated without the state making reasonable efforts toward family reunification, where the mother had previously had parental rights terminated as to another child and no progress was evident in the mother's efforts to kick a four-year drug abuse problem.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Amy B., 2003-NMCA-017, 133 N.M. 136, 61 P.3d 845.\n\nAbandonment by father does not mandate termination.— When a child has been abandoned by a father, i.e., when the parental relationship between father and child is nonexistent, it is not mandatory that the court terminate parental rights. The decision rests within the judicial discretion of the court.Wasson v. Wasson, 1978-NMCA-092, 92 N.M. 162, 584 P.2d 713.\n\nAbandonment during incarceration.— Whether \"abandonment\" has occurred during incarceration is a question of fact to be determined on a case by case basis. Not every act of a parent which results in incarceration, nor every criminal act perpetrated between parents, can be deemed to be abandonment as a matter of law.In re Doe, 1982-NMCA-183, 99 N.M. 278, 657 P.2d 134, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 358, 658 P.2d 443.\n\nAbandonment rests upon incarceration coupled with other factors such as parental neglect, lack of affection shown toward the child, failure to contact the child, financially support the child if able to do so, as well as disregard for the general welfare of the child.In re Doe, 1982-NMCA-183, 99 N.M. 278, 657 P.2d 134, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 358, 658 P.2d 433.\n\nAct of selling children constitutes abandonmentof them as a matter of law.Barwin v. Reidy, 1957-NMSC-016, 62 N.M. 183, 307 P.2d 175.\n\nWhen father, in child's presence, murders child's mother,the district court may terminate the father's parental rights.In re Doe, 1982-NMCA-183, 99 N.M. 278, 657 P.2d 134, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 358, 658 P.2d 443.\n\nSummary judgment improper.— In termination proceeding, mother's contentions as to alleged constructive abandonment, her fitness as a parent, and the state's efforts to assist her in complying with rehabilitation plan were material factual issues which were sufficient to defeat state's summary judgment motion.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Erika M., 1999-NMCA-036, 126 N.M. 760, 975 P.2d 373.\n\n\"Neglect\" by noncustodial parent.— Termination of parental rights by reason of \"neglect\" requires a showing by clear and convincing evidence of culpability on the part of the parent through intentional or negligent disregard of the child's well-being and proper needs. If the parents are separated and living in different communities, in order to hold a noncustodial parent responsible for the neglect of the parent having actual physical custody of the child, it must be established that the noncustodial parent knew or should have known of the condition of the child, that the child was without proper care by the custodial parent because of the faults or habits of that parent, and when able to do so, to provide that care.In re Adoption of J.J.B., 1993-NMCA-145, 117 N.M. 31, 868 P.2d 1256,rev'd in part on other grounds,Roth v.

Ed. 2d 110 (1995).\n\nDepartment may not use psychologists' testimony where it sought examination.— If the human services department [health care authority department] induces a person to be examined and counseled by psychologists, something she would not do but for such inducement, the department is estopped by such conduct to use the psychologists' testimony.In re Doe, 1982-NMCA-115, 98 N.M. 442, 649 P.2d 510.\n\nState must prove one of specific statutory grounds.— In order to terminate a parent's rights, the state must plead and prove one of the specific grounds for termination set out in the statute.State ex rel. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Williams, 1989-NMCA-008, 108 N.M. 332, 772 P.2d 366, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 273, 771 P.2d 981.\n\nJudicial standard for terminating parental rights.— The court shall terminate parental rights with respect to a neglected child when the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the conditions and causes of the neglect are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future despite reasonable efforts by the children, youth and families department to assist the parent in adjusting the conditions that render the parent unable to properly care for the child.State ex rel.

Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Jerry K., 2015-NMCA-047, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-004.\n\nGrounds for termination to be shown by clear and convincing evidence.— In proceedings seeking the termination of parental rights, the grounds for any attempted termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. The clear and convincing evidence standard requires proof stronger than a mere \"preponderance\" and yet something less than \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\"In re Doe, 1982-NMCA-094, 98 N.M. 340, 648 P.2d 798, cert. deniedsub nom. Cook v. Brownfield, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794.\n\nQuantum of proof required concerning evidence as to parents' unfitness must be such as to clearly and convincingly show parents' unfitness. A mere preponderance of the evidence is insufficient.Huey v. Lente, 1973-NMSC-098, 85 N.M. 597, 514 P.2d 1093.\n\nBecause of the fundamental rights involved in a termination proceeding, the burden of proof of clear and convincing evidence is something stronger than a mere preponderance and yet something less than beyond a reasonable doubt.State ex rel. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Natural Mother, 1981-NMCA-103, 96 N.M. 677, 634 P.2d 699.\n\nThe findings to support termination must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.State ex rel. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Natural Mother, 1981-NMCA-103, 96 N.M. 677, 634 P.2d 699.\n\nA trial court's decision in termination of parental rights cases will be upheld if its findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence and if it applied the proper rule of law.State ex rel. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Minjares, 1982-NMSC-065, 98 N.M. 198, 647 P.2d 400.\n\nEvidence that the mother had continually neglected her children by failing to complete and progress in substance abuse treatment and by continuing to place herself in situations involving domestic violence and suspected criminal activity was sufficient to support a finding of neglect.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Vanessa C., 2000-NMCA-025, 128 N.M. 701, 997 P.2d 833, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 690, 997 P.2d 822.\n\nClear and convincing evidence supported termination.— Where the parent was abusing drugs and physically neglecting the child; the child tested positive for opiates; the parent was unsuccessfully discharged from an addiction-recovery program; and the parent failed to keep home visit, therapy, and urinalyses appointments, tested positive for marijuana; failed to attend substance abuse group meetings; was not able to provide a safe and stable living environment for the parent or the child, failed to comply with the department's treatment plan and to use the department's recommended services, and lacked a commitment to the child, clear and convincing evidence supported termination of the parent's parental rights.State ex rel. Children, Youth and Families Dep't v. Laura J., 2013-NMCA-057, 301 P.3d 860, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-003.\n\nSeparate finding of parental unfitness not required for termination.— Parental unfitness is inherent in a finding by the court of any of the statutory conditions: abandonment, neglect or abuse; and no separate showing or finding by the court with reference to unfitness is necessary.In re Adoption of J.J.B., 1995-NMSC-026, 119 N.M. 638, 894 P.2d 994, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 860, 116 S. Ct. 168, 133 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1995).\n\nClear and convincing evidence necessary to support abandonment.— In proceedings seeking to terminate parental rights on grounds of abandonment, the court must be satisfied, by clear and convincing evidence, that the best interests of the child will be served by severing the parent-child relationship.In re Samantha D., 1987-NMCA-082, 106 N.M. 184, 740 P.2d 1168, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.\n\nProof of abandonment.— To prove abandonment (1) parental conduct, evidencing a conscious disregard of obligations owed to the child, and (2) that such conduct led to the disintegration of the parent-child relationship must be established; evidence of the disintegration of the parent-child relationship is of no consequence if not caused by the parent's conduct.In re Adoption of J.J.B., 1995-NMSC-026, 119 N.M. 638, 894 P.2d 994, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 860, 116 S. Ct. 168, 133 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1995).\n\nThe presumption of abandonment imposes on the parent against whom it is directed the burden of going forward to rebut or meet the presumption; however, it does not shift the burden of proof which remains on the person seeking termination of parental rights.In re Adoption of J.J.B., 1995-NMSC-026, 119 N.M. 638, 894 P.2d 994, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 860, 116 S. Ct. 168, 133 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1995).\n\nThe presumption of abandonment that arrives through the statutory factors is completely rebutted by showing that a parent lacks responsibility for the destruction of the parent-child relationship.In re Adoption of J.J.B., 1995-NMSC-026, 119 N.M. 638, 894 P.2d 994, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 860, 116 S. Ct. 168, 133 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1995).\n\nPresumption of abandonment rebutted by evidence that parents did not cause disintegration of parent-child relationship.— In proceedings seeking to terminate parental rights on the grounds of abandonment, where the district court found all of the conditions set forth in 32A-4-28(B)(3) NMSA 1978, but did not enter any findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding the cause of the disintegration of the parent-child relationship between daughter and respondents, the district court erred in terminating parental rights on the grounds of abandonment, because a party seeking termination of parental rights has the burden of proving that the objective parental conduct is the cause of the destruction of the parent-child relationship, and in this case, there was no evidence that respondents caused the delays that contributed to the disintegration of the parent-child relationship with daughter; the suspension of visitation that lasted for several years, based on an unsubstantiated allegation that there may have been child pornography in the home, and the consequent disintegration of the parent-child relationship cannot be blamed on the respondents.State ex rel. CYFD v. Donna E., 2017-NMCA-088.\n\nIntent to abandon.— A parent need not have a subjective intent to abandon the child for abandonment to have occurred; rather, abandonment is defined by the outward behavior of the parent as perceived and interpreted by others and there is no inquiry into the parent's concealed and unexpressed intentions.In re Adoption of J.J.B., 1995-NMSC-026, 119 N.M. 638, 894 P.2d 994, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 860, 116 S. Ct. 168, 133 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1995).\n\nAuthority of court after mother's consent declared invalid.— Since the mother's consent to adoption has been declared invalid in keeping with the best interests of the child, the trial court retains the power to determine custody in the absence of a legally valid consent, and it is within the authority of the trial court to continue the child in the custody of the couple seeking to adopt her. Although they lacked standing to petition the court for adoption, they were not left without remedy, since they did have standing to seek relief.In re Samantha D., 1987-NMCA-082, 106 N.M. 184, 740 P.2d 1168, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.\n\nClear and convincing evidence that the conditions and causes of neglect and abuse were unlikely to change.— In termination of parental rights proceeding, there was clear and convincing evidence to prove that the conditions and causes of neglect and abuse were unlikely to change in the foreseeable future where father, due to his repeated incarcerations, was unable to participate in parenting classes, retain stable housing, follow the recommendations from his substance abuse and mental health assessments, and participate in scheduled visits with his children.State ex rel. CYFD v. Nathan H., 2016-NMCA-043, cert. denied.\n\nEvidence of conditions and causes of neglect and abuse.— Evidence sufficient to support finding that conditions and causes of neglect and abuse were unlikely to change.State ex rel. Human Servs. Dep't v. Wayne R.N., 1988-NMCA-048, 107 N.M. 341, 757 P.2d 1333.\n\nIncarceration.— Even though incarceration alone is not an appropriate reason to terminate parental rights, where the father was convicted of the murder of the mother, his subsequent long-term incarceration was sufficient to establish that the child was neglected, and that termination of his parental rights was justified.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Joe R., 1997-NMSC-038, 123 N.M. 711, 945 P.2d 76.\n\nComponents of \"unfit\" mother not required findings by trial court.— Since the ultimate fact is that a mother is unfit, the trial court is not required to make findings as to the components of \"unfit\" because those components are not ultimate facts.State Health & Social Servs. Dep't v. Smith, 1979-NMCA-004, 93 N.M. 348, 600 P.2d 294, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 532, 591 P.2d 286 (decided under prior law).\n\nAppellate issue to determine substantial evidence of components of \"unfit\".— Having found the ultimate fact that the mother is unfit, the appellate issue does not involve the sufficiency of findings as to the components of \"unfit\"; rather, the appellate issue is whether there was substantial evidence of each of the components so that the finding of the ultimate fact was supported by the evidence.State Health & Social Servs. Dep't v. Smith, 1979-NMCA-004, 93 N.M. 348, 600 P.2d 294, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 532, 591 P.2d 286.\n\nEffect of abuse of sibling.— While abuse of a sibling may be insufficient to justify terminating parental rights, it is evidence that should be considered in determining whether a child has been placed in danger.State ex rel. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Tommy A. M., 1987-NMCA-043, 105 N.M. 664, 735 P.2d 1170.\n\nIV. SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.\n\nAbandonment.— Where the children, youth and families department arranged a visit between the parent and the child, and the parent could not visit at the appointed time because the parent was incarcerated in Colorado; the child moved to Georgia to live with an aunt; when the parent was released from incarceration, the CYFD attempted to set up a home visit with the parent in Colorado, but the parent refused because the parent was traveling to Georgia; the CYFD attempted to set up visits between the child and the parent in Georgia, but could not reach the parent and the parent never attempted to reach the CYFD; when the parent returned to Colorado, the CYFD arranged for calls to the child at the aunt's home and when the parent complained that the aunt wasn't answering the calls and when the parent's comments to the child became inappropriate, the CYFD set up standing calls to the child at the child's therapists office; after the parent failed twice to reach the child at the therapist's office, the parent stopped trying and had no contact with the child for five months, the evidence showed that the parent consciously disregarded the parent's obligations to the child and as a result, the parent-child relationship disintegrated and the trial court properly terminated the parent's parental rights based on abandonment.State ex rel. CYFD v. Benjamin O., 2009-NMCA-039, 146 N.M. 60, 206 P.3d 171.\n\nSufficient evidence to support termination of parental rights.— Where father did not dispute that child was a neglected child, and where the children, youth and families department (department) presented evidence that father was not consistent in attending treatment or counseling services despite numerous referrals, that both the clinical therapist and psychologist indicated that services were needed, that father missed two substance abuse assessments and only completed a mental health assessment less than two weeks prior to the second termination hearing, that father's participation in drug screenings was inconsistent, that father did not have stable housing as required by his treatment plan, and that father was inconsistent in his contact with the department even though he was ordered to maintain contact as part of his treatment plan, there was sufficient evidence for the district court to conclude that father had not alleviated the causes and conditions that led to child being taken into custody and that he would not do so in the foreseeable future, despite reasonable efforts by the department to assist father. The evidence supported termination of father's parental rights in child.State ex rel. CYFD v. William C., Jr., 2017-NMCA-058.\n\nSufficient evidence to support termination of mother's parental rights.— Where child was brought into children, youth and families department (CYFD) custody two months prior to mother pleading no contest to neglecting child due to her domestic violence, substance abuse, and mental health issues, and where, over the next several years, several attempts at visitation between child and mother took place, after which child exhibited negative, and sometimes violent, behavioral issues, and where mother argued that CYFD failed to present sufficient evidence that (1) the conditions and causes of the neglect and abuse were unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, (2) CYFD made reasonable efforts to assist mother in adjusting the conditions that rendered her unable to properly care for child, (3) termination of parental rights was in child's best interests, and (4) child was adoptable, the district court's decision to terminate parental rights were supported by clear and convincing evidence that child was severely traumatized and her state of mind was not conducive to reunification with mother, and it was reasonable for the district court to conclude that mother could not safely parent child based on evidence of child's continued pattern of severe behavioral issues following contact with mother. Clear and convincing evidence supported the district court's finding that the causes and conditions of neglect were not alleviated and were unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, that CYFD made reasonable efforts to reunify child and mother, and that termination of parental rights was in child's best interests.State ex rel. CYFD v. Josie G., 2021-NMCA-063, cert. denied.\n\nTermination of parental rights was in child's best interest.— In a termination of parental rights case, where the children, youth and families department presented evidence of neglect based on father's plea of no contest to neglect of child, evidence that mother's contact with child was inconsistent, leading child to be confused about his future and causing child to become emotionally volatile, which resulted in acts of self-harm and low tolerance regarding conflict with peers, and evidence that father had shown an inability to follow the laws of the state of New Mexico and that his ability to change was uncertain, and where CYFD was not required to make reasonable efforts to assist father in adjusting the conditions that rendered him unable to care for the child because father stipulated to a finding that reunification with child was futile based on father's potential penitentiary sentence on pending criminal charges, there was sufficient evidence to support the district court's finding that it was in child's best interests to terminate father's parental rights.State ex rel. CYFD v. Raymond D., 2017-NMCA-067.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where although parent gave parent's best effort to comply with a treatment plan, because of parent's personality disorder and because of the psychological trauma and emotional damage that the children suffered while in the parent's care, the parent could not safely parent the children and meet their psychological and emotional needs in the forseeable future; children had suffered from sexual and physical abuse; children had a long history of foster care and parent was emotionally depressed and not emotionally available to the children; although parent had obtained mental health treatment, the parent stopped treatment two years prior to the termination hearing; the parent did not exercise the parent's visitation rights with one child for a two year period; and the parent sent another child back to the parent's spouse knowing that the spouse had sexually abused the child, there was sufficient evidence to support termination of parental rights.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families v. Athena H., 2006-NMCA-113, 140 N.M. 390, 142 P.3d 978.\n\nSufficient evidence of reasonable efforts to assist a parent in adjusting conditions.— In a termination of parental rights proceeding that began after a two-month-old child was found to have sustained multiple fractures, including twenty-three rib fractures and four skull fractures in various stages of healing, facial bruising, liver lacerations, brain bleeding, and a possible detached retina while in the care of her mother and father, and where the children, youth and families department (department) prepared a family treatment plan for father, went over the treatment plan with father, detailing ways the father could comply with the plan, provided father with the department's contact information, and scheduled appointments for a court-ordered psychosocial assessment, and where father did not show up for the appointments, did not participate in the psychosocial assessment, made no attempts to contact the department when he was incarcerated and failed to contact the department during any period of time when he was out of custody, and where father failed to show any interest in his child's specialized needs that required a high level of care, the district court did not err in finding that the conditions and causes of child's neglect and abuse were unlikely to change in the foreseeable future despite reasonable efforts by the department under 32A-4-28(B)(2) NMSA 1978 and that termination was in the child's best interest.State ex rel. CYFD v. Keon H., 2018-NMSC-033,rev'g2017-NMCA-004, 387 P.3d 313.\n\nThere was clear and convincing evidence to support the district court's decision that CYFD made reasonable efforts to assist father.— In a case involving the termination of parental rights, where the district court concluded that it was unlikely that father's inability to parent his children would change in the foreseeable future despite the Children, Youth and Families Department's (CYFD) reasonable efforts to assist him, and where father claimed that CYFD did not make reasonable efforts to assist him in adjusting the conditions that rendered him unable to properly care for his children because CYFD did not provide him with specific contact information or direction to the services he was referred to and because he was not given sufficient time to work the case plan, there was clear and convincing evidence to support the district court's decision based on evidence that CYFD attempted to assist father repeatedly during the pendency of his case, but father repeatedly demonstrated an unwillingness to engage with his treatment plan, never participated in a psychological evaluation as ordered by the court, and missed twenty percent of all scheduled visitation and refused to acknowledge the circumstances that brought his children into CYFD custody.State ex rel. CYFD v. Brian F., 2023-NMCA-087.\n\nEvidence supported presumptive abandonment.— The evidence did not support a finding that the causes and conditions of the father's neglect were unlikely to change in the foreseeable future where after the father was released from prison, he participated in all programs that CYFD recommended; he made substantial changes in this life to ensure the return of his children; and he held a stable job, established a support system, ceased to use drugs, and stayed clear of his past gang life, but the evidence supported the district court's termination of the father's parental rights based on the father's presumptive abandonment of the children where a parent-child bond with one child had disintegrated and had never existed with the other child; the children lived in the home of foster parents for an extended time and developed a parent-child relationship with the foster parents; the father had limited contact with the children during his incarceration; and the father made minimal effort to have the children placed with relatives.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Hector C., 2008-NMCA-079, 144 N.M. 222, 185 P.3d 1072, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-004, 144 N.M. 47, 183 P.3d 932.\n\nSubstantial evidence.— Evidence which established that the father failed to be involved in the children's lives prior to his incarceration; his failure to provide a safe and stable home by dealing in drugs in their home; his decision to leave the children's home when they were very young; his decision to violate the terms of his probation resulting in his incarceration; his failure to provide for the children or to protect them from the mother's neglect both prior to and during his incarceration; his knowledge that the mother used drugs and had a history of neglecting her children; his failure to contact the children while incarcerated; the termination of the father's parental rights to another child under similar circumstances; the father's parole to Florida; CYFD continued to offer reunification services to the father while he was incarcerated and after he was paroled, was substantial evidence of neglect, that the father was unlikely to properly parent the children in the future, that the department made reasonable efforts to assist the father, that the father abandoned the children and that aggravated circumstance existed that made further efforts to assist the father unnecessary.State ex rel., Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. William M., 2007-NMCA-055, 141 N.M. 765, 161 P.3d 262, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-005, 141 N.M. 762, 161 P.3d 259.\n\nAbandonment found.— Termination of a mother's parental rights was proper since the evidence established a rebuttable presumption of abandonment which the mother failed to overcome.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. John D., 1997-NMCA-019, 123 N.M. 114, 934 P.2d 308.\n\nDisintegration of parent-child relationship.— Substantial evidence beyond reasonable doubt supported court's termination of parental rights due to disintegration of parent-child relationship.Laurie R. v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 1988-NMCA-055, 107 N.M. 529, 760 P.2d 1295.\n\nEvidence held sufficient to terminate parental rights.— Trial court's findings for termination of the mother's parental rights were supported by clear and convincing evidence, since the human services department [health care authority department] made reasonable efforts to assist her in improving her ability to care for her children, which efforts proved ultimately futile.State ex rel. Human Serv. Dep't v. Dennis S., 1989-NMCA-032, 108 N.M. 486, 775 P.2d 252, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 485, 775 P.2d 251.\n\nTermination of a mother's parental rights to four children was justified by clear and convincing evidence that the children were abused and neglected, the conditions and causes of the abuse and neglect were unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, and the children, youth and families department made reasonable efforts to assist the mother in adjusting the conditions which rendered her unable to properly care for the children.State v. Eventyr J., 1995-NMCA-087, 120 N.M. 463, 902 P.2d 1066.\n\nWhere department made minimal but statutorily sufficient efforts to assist mother, but there were no signs that the parent-child relationship would likely change for the better in the foreseeable future, parental rights were rightfully terminated.In re Elizabeth H., 2002-NMCA-061, 132 N.M. 299, 47 P.3d 859, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 397, 49 P.3d 76.\n\nTrial court was justified in terminating parental rightsto a four-year old child who had been adjudicated as a neglected child after being diagnosed as having nonorganic failure to thrive, where there was clear and convincing evidence to support the court's finding that the conditions and causes of the neglect were unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.State ex rel. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Williams, 1989-NMCA-008, 108 N.M. 332, 772 P.2d 366, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 273, 771 P.2d 981.\n\nV. INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.\n\nInsufficient evidence for termination of parental rights.— Where CYFD claimed that the parental rights of the petitioner should be terminated, because the petitioner failed to understand the harm that had been done to the petitioner's children and because the petitioner failed to take responsibility for the causes that had prompted the department to take custody of the children; CYFD's claims were based on the facts that had initially caused CYFD to take the petitioner's children into custody; and since the time when CYFD had taken the children into custody, the petitioner had successfully addressed the petitioner's alcohol and drug dependency, the petitioner regularly attended AA meetings, the petitioner made some, but not all, required child support payments, and the petitioner complied with all other requirements of CYFD's treatment plan; the petitioner made positive behavioral changes and learned skills to manage emotional moods; the petitioner recognized that the petitioner had made some poor choices regarding the petitioner's personal life that had affected the children; and the petitioner was openly affectionate with the children and the children were attached to the petitioner, the evidence did not support a determination that the causes and conditions of abuse and neglect were unlikely to change in the foreseeable future or that the petitioner had presumptively abandoned the children.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Lance K., 2009-NMCA-054, 146 N.M. 286, 209 P.3d 778, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-004, 146 N.M. 641, 213 P.3d 791.\n\nInsufficient evidence of \"active efforts\" requirement.— Where father's parental rights to his three children were terminated following the district court's adjudication of neglect, and where father argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the district court's finding that the Children, Youth and Families Department (CYFD) made \"active efforts\" to reunite father and children and prevent the breakup of the Indian family, the undisputed evidence presented by CYFD of the efforts to reunite father and children was not sufficient to reasonably support the district court's finding that CYFD made the \"active efforts\" to provide father with remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the family, where the evidence showed that CYFD had not provided active assistance in obtaining services for father, had not developed or proposed alternative ways of meeting father's need for parenting classes in light of his difficulty with computer technology, had not facilitated in-person visits with children, had not monitored father's progress, had not provided assistance to father in obtaining appropriate housing for him and children, and had not assessed either the home father ultimately found without CYFD assistance prior to the termination of his parental rights or father's ability to care for children in his North Dakota home without creating a likelihood of serious emotional or physical damage to children.CYFD v. James M., 2023-NMCA-025, cert. denied.\n\nInsufficient evidence of abandonment.— Under 32A-4-28(B)(2) NMSA 1978, the children, youth and families department (CYFD) must establish that a child has been neglected or abused and that the conditions and causes of the neglect and abuse are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future despite reasonable efforts by CYFD or other appropriate agency to assist the parent in adjusting the conditions that render the parent unable to properly care for the child, and CYFD must also demonstrate that termination serves the physical, mental and emotional welfare and needs of the child, including the likelihood of the child being adopted if parental rights are terminated.State ex rel. CYFD v. Alfonso M.E., 2016-NMCA-021.\n\nWhere children, youth and families department (CYFD) moved to terminate father's parental rights one month after his deportation and discontinued its communication shortly thereafter, failed to introduce any other evidence in support of the conclusion that father's past conduct demonstrated that the causes and conditions of neglect persisted at the time of trial, were unlikely to change, and currently impacted father's ability to parent child, and failed to reevaluate father's progress in ameliorating the causes and conditions of neglect, despite father's efforts to comply with significant aspects of his treatment plan, CYFD's subsequent presentation of incomplete evidence was not substantial evidence of a clear and convincing nature that justified termination of father's parental rights under the Abuse and Neglect Act. The district court erred in terminating father's parental rights for abandonment.State ex rel. CYFD v. Alfonso M.E., 2016-NMCA-021.\n\nInsufficient evidence to terminate parental rights of incarcerated parent.— Where the children, youth and families department (CYFD) filed a motion to terminate father's parental rights based on father's \"unavailability\", due to father's incarceration for much of the time his child was in CYFD custody, and for failure to follow the treatment plan adopted by the district court, there was insufficient evidence to support the termination of parental rights, because CYFD's actions were incomplete as to both implementing an appropriate treatment plan for father in facilitating interaction with him during his incarceration and when he was released from incarceration, and therefore CYFD failed in its burden to proffer sufficient evidence of reasonable efforts to assist father with reunification.State ex rel.

The motion for termination of parental rights shall set forth:\n\n(1) the date, place of birth and marital status of the child, if known;\n\n(2) the grounds for termination and the facts and circumstances supporting the grounds for termination;\n\n(3) the names and addresses of the persons or authorized agency or agency officer to whom legal custody might be transferred;\n\n(4) whether the child resides or has resided with a foster parent who desires to adopt the child;\n\n(5) whether the motion is in contemplation of adoption;\n\n(6) the relationship or legitimate interest of the moving party to the child; and\n\n(7) whether the child is subject to the Indian Family Protection Act [32A-28-1 to 32A-28-42 NMSA 1978].\n\nC. Notice of the filing of the motion, accompanied by a copy of the motion, shall be served by the moving party on all other parties, the foster parent, preadoptive parent or relative providing care for the child with whom the child is residing, foster parents with whom the child has resided for six months within the previous twelve months, the custodian of the child, any person appointed to represent any party and any other person the court orders. Service shall be in accordance with the Children's Court Rules for the service of motions, except that foster parents and attorneys of record in this proceeding shall be served by certified mail. The notice shall state specifically that the person served shall file a written response to the motion within twenty days if the person intends to contest the termination. Further notice shall not be required on a parent who has been provided notice previously pursuant to Section 32A-4-17 NMSA 1978 and who failed to make an appearance.\n\nD. When a motion to terminate parental rights is filed, the moving party shall request a hearing on the motion. The hearing date shall be at least thirty days, but no more than sixty days, after service is effected upon the parties entitled to service under this section. The moving party shall also file a motion for court-ordered mediation between the parent and any prospective adoptive parent to discuss an open adoption agreement. If an open adoption agreement is reached at any time before termination of parental rights, it shall be made a part of the court record.\n\nE. In any action for the termination of parental rights brought by a party other than the department and involving a child in the legal custody of the department, the department may:\n\n(1) litigate a motion for the termination of parental rights that was initially filed by another party; or\n\n(2) move that the motion for the termination of parental rights be found premature and denied.\n\nF. When a motion to terminate parental rights is filed, the department shall perform concurrent planning.\n\nG. When a child has been in foster care for not less than fifteen of the previous twenty-two months, the department shall file a motion to terminate parental rights, unless:\n\n(1) a parent has made substantial progress toward eliminating the problem that caused the child's placement in foster care; it is likely that the child will be able to safely return to the parent's home within three months; and the child's return to the parent's home will be in the child's best interests;\n\n(2) the child has a close and positive relationship with a parent and a permanent plan that does not include termination of parental rights will provide the most secure and appropriate placement for the child;\n\n(3) the child is fourteen years of age or older, is firmly opposed to termination of parental rights and is likely to disrupt an attempt to place the child with an adoptive family;\n\n(4) a parent is terminally ill, but in remission, and does not want parental rights to be terminated; provided that the parent has designated a guardian for the child;\n\n(5) the child is not capable of functioning if placed in a family setting. In such a case, the court shall reevaluate the status of the child every ninety days unless there is a final court determination that the child cannot be placed in a family setting;\n\n(6) grounds do not exist for termination of parental rights;\n\n(7) the child is an unaccompanied, refugee minor and the situation regarding the child involves international legal issues or compelling foreign policy issues;\n\n(8) adoption is not an appropriate plan for the child; or\n\n(9) the parent's incarceration or participation in a court-ordered residential substance abuse treatment program constitutes the primary factor in the child's placement in substitute care and termination of parental rights is not in the child's best interest.\n\nH. For purposes of this section, a child shall be considered to have entered foster care on the earlier of:\n\n(1) the date of the first judicial finding that the child has been abused or neglected; or\n\n(2) the date that is sixty days after the date on which the child was removed from the home.\n\nI. The grounds for any attempted termination shall be proved by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nJ. When the court terminates parental rights, it shall appoint a custodian for the child and fix responsibility for the child's support.\n\nK. A judgment of the court terminating parental rights divests the parent of all legal rights and privileges and dispenses with both the necessity for the consent to or receipt of notice of any subsequent adoption proceeding concerning the child. A judgment of the court terminating parental rights shall not affect the child's rights of inheritance from and through the child's biological parents.\n\nL. When the court denies a motion to terminate parental rights, the court shall issue appropriate orders immediately. The court shall direct the parties to file a stipulated order and interim plan or a request for hearing within thirty days of the date of the hearing denying the termination of parental rights.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-4-29, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 123; 1997, ch. 34, § 10; 1999, ch. 77, § 11; 2001, ch. 315, § 1; 2003, ch. 108, § 1; 2005, ch. 189, § 52; 2009, ch. 239, § 49; 2022, ch. 41, § 55.\n\nCross references.— For termination procedures in adoption cases,see32A-5-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor termination of parental rights,seeRule 10-347 NMRA.\n\nFor service of motions,seeRule 10-104 NMRA.\n\nFor motion to terminate parental rights,seeRule 10-470 NMRA.\n\nFor the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978,see25 U.S.C. § 1901.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective July 1, 2022, removed provisions related to Indian children which are now covered by the Indian Family Protection Act, and required that a motion for termination of parental rights set forth whether the child is subject to the Indian Family Protection Act; in Subsection B, Paragraph B(7), after \"subject to the\", deleted \"federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 and, if so\" and added \"Indian Family Protection Act\", deleted Subparagraphs B(7)(a) through B(7)(c); in Subsection C, deleted \"In any case involving a child subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, notice shall also be sent by certified mail to the tribes of the child's parents and upon any 'Indian custodian' as that term is defined in 25 U.S.C.

Section 1912(f)\"; and deleted former Subsection K and redesignated former Subsections L and M as Subsections K and L, respectively.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2022, ch. 41, § 73 provided that the provisions of Laws 2022, ch. 41 apply to all cases filed on or after July 1, 2022.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection D, added the third and fourth sentences; added Paragraph (9) of Subsection G; and added Subsection M.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, deleted former Subsection A(1) through (3), which listed the persons and entities who could initiate a termination proceeding and provides that a motion to terminate parental rights may be made by a party to the proceeding; deleted the former requirement in Subsection B that a motion be signed, verified and filed with the court; deleted former Subsection C, which provided that a parent who has not been a party shall be named a party in the motion and shall be become a party unless the parent has not established a protected liberty interest with respect to the child; in Subsection C, provided that service shall be in accordance with the Children's Court Rules; deleted former Subsection E, which provided that if the identity or whereabouts of a person are unknown, the court could permit service by publication; deleted former Subsection F, which provided that after a motion is filed, the parent shall be advised of the right to counsel and that counsel shall be appointed upon request for any parent who cannot afford counsel or the interests of justice require the appointment; deleted former Subsection G, which provided that the court shall ensure that a guardian ad litem represents the child in all proceedings for termination of parental rights; in Subsection E, changed \"custody\" to \"legal custody\"; and in Subsection G(3), changed \"thirteen years of age\" to \"fourteen years of age\".\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, substituted \"foster care\" for \"the custody of the department\" preceding \"for not less\" in Subsection K; added present Subsection L and redesignated former Subsections L to O as present Subsections M to P.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, inserted Subsections J and K and redesignated subsequent subsections.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, in Subsection D, substituted \"the foster parent, preadoptive parent or relative providing care for the child\" for \"foster parents\" in the first sentence and updated a statutory reference in the last sentence.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective July 1, 1997, added \"unless the court determines that the parent has not established a protected liberty interest in his relationship with the child\" at the end of Subsection C; in Subsection D, in the first sentence, substituted \"all other parties\" for \"the parents of the child, any parent who has not previously been made a party to the proceeding\", deleted \"the department,\" following \"custodian of the child,\" and deleted \"including the child's guardian ad litem,\", in the second sentence, substituted \"service of motions\" for \"service of process\", in the fourth sentence, substituted \"sent by certified mail to\" for \"served upon\" and added the last sentence; inserted \"but no more than sixty days,\" in the second sentence in Subsection H; and made minor stylistic changes in Subparagraph B(7)(b) and in Subsection D.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-55 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where the parent physically abused and neglected the child's siblings; the parent had a history of reoccurring domestic violence that involved drug and alcohol use; three incidences of domestic violence occurred when the child was in utero; the parent failed to follow a treatment plan that included drug testing and counseling to improve family relations and parenting skills; and the parent failed to participate in most of the remedial services and rehabilitative programs provided by the Children, Youth and Families Department that included a program for parenting skills, supervised visitations, drug and alcohol assessment and treatment, mental health and family relations assessment, transportation for the parent's appointments to programs and services provided by the department, there was sufficient evidence to determine that the child was abused and neglected and that the department had made active efforts to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs to prevent the family's break up.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Arthur C., 2011-NMCA-022, 149 N.M. 472, 251 P.3d 729.\n\nBurden of proof for neglect determinations involving the federal Indian Child Welfare Act.— The grounds supporting termination of parental rights in cases involving the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, including the determination that a child has been abused or neglected under § 32A-4-28(B)(2) NMSA 1978, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.State ex rel. CYFD v. Maisie Y., 2021-NMCA-023,overruling in part State ex rel. CYFD v. Yodell B., 2016-NMCA-029, 367 P.3d 881.\n\nWhere the children, youth and families department (CYFD) filed an abuse and neglect petition against appellant (mother), alleging that mother neglected her two-month old child, and where CYFD moved to terminate mother's parental rights to all four of her children, and where, following a termination of parental rights trial, the district court, taking judicial notice of mother's prior adjudications of neglect, terminated mother's parental rights but failed to tie its finding of neglect to evidence presented during the trial, the district court's reliance solely on mother's prior adjudications of abuse and neglect, which were made under a clear and convincing standard, to support its finding that the children were neglected, was inadequate to demonstrate that it made the necessary finding beyond a reasonable doubt to support termination of parental rights.State ex rel. CYFD v. Maisie Y., 2021-NMCA-023,overruling in part State ex rel. CYFD v. Yodell B., 2016-NMCA-029, 367 P.3d 881.\n\n\"Active efforts,\" in a termination of parental rights proceeding, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.— In cases where the federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) applies, a showing of active efforts on the part of the children, youth & families department is required before a parent's parental rights may be terminated, and because § 32A-4-29(I) NMSA 1978, applies the beyond a reasonable doubt standard to the grounds for parental terminations in ICWA cases, New Mexico law requires that active efforts be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.State ex rel. CYFD v. Maisie Y., 2021-NMCA-023,overruling in part State ex rel. CYFD v. Yodell B., 2016-NMCA-029, 367 P.3d 881.\n\nStandard of proof for determinations of \"active efforts\" under the federal Indian Child Welfare Act.— Under the federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), a party seeking to terminate parental rights shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful. \"Active efforts\" are intended primarily to maintain and reunite an Indian child with his or her family or tribal community and connotes a more involved and less passive standard than that of reasonable efforts. The proper standard of proof for determinations under 25 U.S.C. § 1912(d) of the ICWA is the clear and convincing standard, which is applicable to the underlying termination of parental rights proceedings under 32A-4-29(I) NMSA 1978.State ex rel. CYFD v. Yodell B., 2016-NMCA-029, 367 P.3d 881,overruled in part byState ex rel. CYFD v. Maisie Y., 2021-NMCA-023.\n\nIn a termination of parental rights case, where the evidence established that the children, youth and families department (department) permanency planning worker took affirmative steps of meeting with father to create a treatment plan, and referring father to a parenting class, but did little else to assist father in implementing the treatment plan, the department took a passive role by shouldering father with the burden of not only independently locating and obtaining services, but also ensuring the service providers were communicating with the department about his progress. The department did not present clear and convincing evidence that active efforts were made to prevent the breakup of father's family.State ex rel. CYFD v. Yodell B., 2016-NMCA-029, 367 P.3d 881,overruled in part byState ex rel. CYFD v. Maisie Y., 2021-NMCA-023.\n\nPresumption of retroactivity.— Based on the importance of the especially significant interests at stake for children and parents in cases involving the Abuse and Neglect Act, Chapter 32A, Article 4 NMSA 1978, as well as the need to eliminate disparate outcomes in such cases simply by virtue of the position of a case on the judicial docket, the presumption of retroactivity applies to abuse and neglect cases.State ex rel. CYFD v. Ruben C., 2022-NMCA-063, cert. granted.\n\nClarifications of New Mexico law regarding standards of proof in termination of parental rights cases subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act.— The New Mexico court of appeals decision inState ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Maisie Y., 2021-NMCA-023 (Maisie Y.), which held that in cases subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), all grounds to terminate parental rights, including determinations of abuse and neglect, must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, judicial notice of prior adjudications of abuse and neglect made under the clear and convincing evidence standard, without more, is insufficient, and the active efforts requirement of the ICWA must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, will be applied retroactively.State ex rel. CYFD v. Ruben C., 2022-NMCA-063, cert. granted.\n\nApplication of higher standards of proof required byState ex rel. CYFD v. Maisie Y.— Where father's parental rights were terminated prior to the New Mexico court of appeals decision inState ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Maisie Y., 2021-NMCA-023 (Maisie Y.), which held that in cases subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), all grounds to terminate parental rights, including determinations of abuse and neglect, must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, judicial notice of prior adjudications of abuse and neglect made under the clear and convincing evidence standard, without more, is insufficient, and the active efforts requirement of the ICWA must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the district court's termination of father's parental rights required reversal, because it was possible that CYFD may not have met the higher standards of proof required byMaisie Y.State ex rel. CYFD v. Ruben C., 2022-NMCA-063, cert. granted.\n\nJudicial notice of case file.— If the district court feels it necessary to take judicial notice of all or part of a case file in a termination of parental rights proceeding, the court should state what information, specifically, is being judicially noticed and how the court intends to use the judicially noticed information.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Brandy S., 2007-NMCA-135, 142 N.M. 705, 168 P.3d 1129.\n\nRequired filing of termination motion.— Barring exceptional circumstances, the Abuse and Neglect Act requires a termination motion to be filed when the child has been in foster care for 15 out of 22 months.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't. v. Maria C., 2004-NMCA-083, 136 N.M. 53, 94 P.3d 796.\n\nTiming of hearing.— Failure to hold the termination of parental rights hearing within 60 days, as required by Subsection H (now D), does not mandate a dismissal of the motion to terminate parental rights.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Anne McD., 2000-NMCA-020, 128 N.M. 618, 995 P.2d 1060.\n\nNo right to jury trial.— There is no right to a trial by jury in termination of parental rights proceedings provided by either the Children's Code or the state constitution.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. T.J., 1997-NMCA-021, 123 N.M. 99, 934 P.2d 293, cert. denied, 122 N.M. 808, 932 P.2d 498.\n\nDue process rights of incarcerated parent in termination hearing.— Because a fundamental liberty interest is implicated in proceedings involving the termination of parental rights, a parent who is incarcerated and is unable to attend a hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights is entitled to procedural due process, including the right to review and challenge the evidence presented against him and to present evidence on his behalf.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Ruth Anne E., 1999-NMCA-035, 126 N.M. 670, 974 P.2d 164.\n\nWaiver of objection to venue.— Mother, who appealed district court's judgment terminating her parental rights, waived her claim of improper venue, where she failed to raise her venue-statute objection at a time when any error could have been cured promptly. In re Kenny F., 1990-NMCA-004, 109 N.M. 472, 786 P.2d 699,overruled on other grounds byIn re Adoption of J.J.B., 1993-NMCA-145, 117 N.M. 31, 868 P.2d 1256.\n\nLack of notice of issue of continuation of parental rights violates mother's due process rights.— Since the issue of termination of parental rights was not raised in the pleadings, nor properly tried and was mentioned for the first time after closing arguments, when counsel for the father made an oral motion that the parental rights of the mother be terminated, the procedural due process rights of the mother were violated as she was never given notice that the continuation of her parental rights was at issue, she did not have a full opportunity to prepare her case and, consequently, she was not given a full and fair hearing.In re Arnall, 1980-NMSC-052, 94 N.M. 306, 610 P.2d 193.\n\nSufficiency of notice.— Although the summons served upon a father in a termination of parental rights action did not meet the requirements in the statute, there was no showing that the father was prejudiced by the various errors in the notice.Ronald A. v. State ex rel. Human Servs. Dep't, 1990-NMSC-071, 110 N.M. 454, 794 P.2d 371.\n\nPrior proceeding concerned with the fact of neglect is not a jurisdictional barto a later, separate termination proceeding.In re Doe, 1982-NMCA-115, 98 N.M. 442, 649 P.2d 510.\n\nSince neglect proceedings do not result in final judgment on merits,the department is not barred under the \"judgments\" rule from later bringing termination proceedings.In re Doe, 1982-NMCA-115, 98 N.M. 442, 649 P.2d 510.\n\nVerification of pleadings.— Although the human services department [health care authority department] failed to obtain the court's permission prior to filing its amended petitions to terminate parental rights, the court granted permission to file the final amended petition and verification prior to the commencement of trial. Allowance of this amendment rectified any insufficiency in the earlier pleadings not being verified. The court, therefore, was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction.Laurie R. v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 1988-NMCA-055, 107 N.M. 529, 760 P.2d 1295.\n\nAuthority of court after mother's consent declared invalid.— Since the mother's consent to adoption has been declared invalid in keeping with the best interests of the child, the trial court retains the power to determine custody in the absence of a legally valid consent, and it is within the authority of the trial court to continue the child in the custody of the couple seeking to adopt her. Although they lacked standing to petition the court for adoption, they were not left without remedy, since they did have standing to seek relief.In re Samantha D., 1987-NMCA-082, 106 N.M. 184, 740 P.2d 1168, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.\n\nRight to competent counsel.— The right of a parent to counsel includes the right to competent counsel. In a trial the judge has an obligation to facilitate the resolution of the issue of whether that parent has received effective assistance of counsel by holding an evidentiary hearing if he or she expresses concerns that merit such a hearing.In re James W.H., 1993-NMCA-028, 115 N.M. 256, 849 P.2d 1079, cert. deniedsub nom. Hellums v. State, 115 N.M. 545, 854 P.2d 872.\n\nRight to counsel on appeal.— Mother had a right to court-appointed counsel on appeal of a decision terminating her parental rights and counsel had an obligation to present her issues in accordance with the guidelines set forth inState v. Franklin, 1967-NMSC-151, 78 N.M. 127, 428 P.2d 982.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v.

Wendy T., 1994-NMCA-096, 118 N.M. 352, 881 P.2d 712.\n\nSummary judgment may be used to terminate parental rightswhere there are no issues of fact underlying the basis or termination.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Wendy T., 1994-NMCA-096, 118 N.M. 352, 881 P.2d 712.\n\nTermination of parental rights severs the parent's support obligation.Aeda v. Aeda, 2013-NMCA-095, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-009.\n\nWhere a divorce decree ordered respondent to pay monthly child support until respondent's children reached majority, were emancipated or until further order of the court; petitioner subsequently filed for termination of respondent's parental rights; respondent entered an appearance, but did not participate in the case; the termination order made no mention of alteration of the child support order; and petitioner sought to collect child support arrearages under the divorce decree, termination of respondent's parental rights terminated respondent's child support obligations.Aeda v.

A motion for permanent guardianship shall set forth:\n\n(1) the date, place of birth and marital status of the child, if known;\n\n(2) the facts and circumstances supporting the grounds for permanent guardianship;\n\n(3) the name and address of the prospective guardian and a statement that the person agrees to accept the duties and responsibilities of guardianship;\n\n(4) the basis for the court's jurisdiction;\n\n(5) the relationship of the child to the petitioner and the prospective guardian; and\n\n(6) whether the child is subject to the Indian Family Protection Act [32A-28-1 to 32A-28-42 NMSA 1978] and, if so, any additional requirements for that motion as provided pursuant to the Indian Family Protection Act.\n\nC. If the motion is not filed by the prospective guardian, the motion shall be verified by the prospective guardian.\n\nD. Notice of the filing of the motion, accompanied by a copy of the motion, shall be served by the moving party on any parent who has not previously been made a party to the proceeding, the parents of the child, foster parents with whom the child is residing, the foster parent, preadoptive parent or relative providing care for the child with whom the child has resided for six months, the child's custodian, the department, any person appointed to represent any party, including the child's guardian ad litem, and any other person the court orders provided with notice. Service shall be in accordance with the Children's Court Rules for the service of motions. Further notice shall not be required to a parent who has been provided notice previously pursuant to Section 32A-4-17 NMSA 1978 and who failed to make an appearance.\n\nE. The grounds for permanent guardianship shall be proved by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nF. A judgment of the court vesting permanent guardianship with an individual divests the biological or adoptive parent of legal custody or guardianship of the child, but is not a termination of the parent's rights. A child's inheritance rights from and through the child's biological or adoptive parents are not affected by this proceeding.\n\nG. Upon a finding that grounds exist for a permanent guardianship, the court may incorporate into the final order provisions for visitation with the natural parents, siblings or other relatives of the child and any other provision necessary to rehabilitate the child or provide for the child's continuing safety and well-being.\n\nH. The court shall retain jurisdiction to enforce its judgment of permanent guardianship.\n\nI. Any party may make a motion for revocation of the order granting guardianship when there is a significant change of circumstances, including:\n\n(1) the child's parent is able and willing to properly care for the child; or\n\n(2) the child's guardian is unable to properly care for the child.\n\nJ. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the child in all proceedings for the revocation of permanent guardianship if the child is under the age of fourteen. The court shall appoint an attorney for the child in all proceedings for the revocation of permanent guardianship if the child is fourteen years of age or older at the inception of the proceedings.\n\nK. The court may revoke the order granting guardianship when a significant change of circumstances has been proven by clear and convincing evidence and it is in the child's best interests to revoke the order granting guardianship.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-4-32, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 126; 1999, ch. 77, § 12; 2005, ch. 189, § 55; 2009, ch. 239, § 50; 2022, ch. 41, § 56.\n\nCross references.— For process in the Children's Court,seeRule 10-103 NMRA.\n\nFor the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978,see25 U.S.C. § 1901.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective July 1, 2022, required that a motion for permanent guardianship set forth whether the child is subject to the Indian Family Protection Act, removed provisions related to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, and provisions related to Indian children which are now covered by the Indian Family Protection Act; in Subsection B, Paragraph B(6), after \"subject to the\", deleted \"federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978\" and added \"Indian Family Protection Act\", and after \"if so\", added \"any additional requirements for that motion as provided pursuant to the Indian Family Protection Act\", and deleted Subparagraphs B(6)(a) through B(6)(c); in Subsection D, deleted \"In a case involving a child subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, notice shall also be sent by certified mail to the Indian tribes of the child's parents and to any 'Indian custodian' as that term is defined in 25 U.S.C.
