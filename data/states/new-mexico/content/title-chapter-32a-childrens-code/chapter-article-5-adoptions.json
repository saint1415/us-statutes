Bowdoin, 2006-NMCA-013, 138 N.M. 857, 126 P.3d 1221.\n\nPurpose of statutes for adoption isto make provision for the welfare of children and the legislation should be liberally construed to effect that purpose.Barwin v. Reidy, 1957-NMSC-016, 62 N.M. 183, 307 P.2d 175.\n\nAdoption statutes accorded liberal construction.— Adoption statutes are enacted in favor of humanity and are to be accorded a liberal construction by the courts.Hahn v.

Thus, the jurisdictional requirements of the statute for this special proceeding must be strictly followed.Barwin v. Reidy, 1957-NMSC-016, 62 N.M. 183, 307 P.2d 175.\n\nEquitable adoption.— New Mexico courts have recognized the doctrine of equitable adoption.Poncho v.

The provisions of Subsection A of this section do not apply to a child in the department's custody who is being adopted pursuant to the provisions of the Abuse and Neglect Act [Chapter 32A, Article 4 NMSA 1978].\n\nC. When an adoptee is not in the custody of the department or an agency, the adoption is an independent adoption and the provisions of this section and Section 32A-5-13 NMSA 1978 shall apply, except when the following circumstances exist:\n\n(1) a stepparent of the adoptee seeks to adopt the adoptee and prior to the filing of the adoption petition, the adoptee has lived with the stepparent for at least one year since the marriage of the stepparent to the custodial parent and the family has received counseling, as provided for in Section 32A-5-22 NMSA 1978;\n\n(2) a relative within the fifth degree of consanguinity to the adoptee or that relative's spouse seeks to adopt the adoptee, and, prior to the filing of the adoption petition, the adoptee has lived with the relative or the relative's spouse for at least one year; or\n\n(3) a person designated to care for the adoptee in the will of the adoptee's deceased parent seeks to adopt the adoptee, and, prior to the filing of the adoption petition, the adoptee has lived with that person for at least one year.\n\nD.

In all adoptions, prior to any placement being made, the person making the placement shall provide full disclosure.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-5-12, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 139; 1995, ch. 206, § 30.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, added \"full disclosure\" in the section heading; in Paragraph (4) of Subsection A, substituted \"32A-5-13\" for \"32-5-13\"; in Subsection C, substituted \"this section and Section 32A-5-13\" for \"Sections 32-5-12 and 32-5-13\"; in Paragraph (1) of Subsection C, substituted \"32A-5-22\" for \"32-5-22\"; at the end of Subsection D, added \"pursuant to Section 32A-5-13 NMSA 1978\"; and added Subsection E.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 40-7-34 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nLegislative intent.— The obvious legislative intent is two-fold: (1) to restrict the unauthorized placement of children for adoption; and (2) to provide a means whereby the department or an authorized child placement agency could ensure the placement of adoptable children with individuals who have been found by competent authorities to be fit and proper as prospective adoptive parents.In re Doe, 1982-NMCA-094, 98 N.M. 340, 648 P.2d 798.\n\nSection not jurisdictional limit.— There was nothing in former Section 40-7-34A NMSA 1978 suggesting a limitation on the children's court's jurisdiction. Section 40-7-34A NMSA 1978 was merely a statute that limited the court's power to grant a petition for adoption. If the party could not prove the facts necessary, then the statute was of no value to that party. Specifically, unless the foster parent could plead and prove that human services department [health care authority department] placed the children with her for adoption, she was not entitled to the right of adoption former Section 40-7-34A NMSA 1978 provided.In re Adoption of Francisco A., 1993-NMCA-144, 116 N.M. 708, 866 P.2d 1175.\n\nAdoption valid without filing a petition.— Where petitioner filed a request for placement, but did not file a petition for adoption, the biological parent consented to the adoption, and the district court had an opportunity to examine all of the information and evidence that would have been supplied by a petition, the failure to file a petition was not jurisdictional and the adoption decree was valid.In re Adoption of Rebecca M., 2008-NMCA-038, 143 N.M. 554, 178 P.3d 839.\n\nDuties of disclosure found in Subsection E.— Pre-adoption and adoption-related duties of disclosure are found in Subsection E of this section.Young v. Van Duyne, 2004-NMCA-074, 135 N.M. 695, 92 P.3d 1269.\n\nFull disclosure meansmandatory and continuous disclosure, including health, psychological, mental, medication, education, and social histories.Young v. Van Duyne, 2004-NMCA-074, 135 N.M. 695, 92 P.3d 1269.\n\nDisclosure to adoptive parents.— Department had no duty to disclose the post-adoption information regarding the child to the adoptive parents.Young v. Van Duyne, 2004-NMCA-074, 135 N.M. 695, 92 P.3d 1269.\n\nEffect of finality of adoption.— There is no statute or regulation that creates any duty or responsibility of the department and its employees, after an adoption is finalized, with respect to supervision, oversight, operation or maintenance of the home into which a child is placed for adoption, after an adoption becomes final.Young v. Van Duyne, 2004-NMCA-074, 135 N.M. 695, 92 P.3d 1269.\n\nElecting to leave child with ex-spouse for extended period of timeis not a \"placement\" for purposes of adoption.In re Doe, 1982-NMCA-094, 98 N.M. 340, 648 P.2d 798, cert. deniedsub nom. Cook v. Brownfield, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794.\n\nFailure to meet Adoption Act's requirements requires reversal.— Where mother's parental rights were terminated and her child was placed for adoption with child's grandmother, the petition for adoption was invalid where the statutory prerequisites, that the children, youth and families department place the child with the child's grandmother for the purpose of adoption or that the child live with the grandmother for at least one year, were not met.In re Adoption Petition of Darla D. v. Grace R., 2016-NMCA-093.\n\nStepparent adoptions.— The one-year residency provision for stepparent adoptions is not jurisdictional in nature; it is a statutory prerequisite to stepparent adoption and, therefore, the father could not challenge the adoption decree on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction because the one-year residency requirement was not met.In re Adoption of Webber, 1993-NMCA-099, 116 N.M. 47, 859 P.2d 1074.\n\nFoster placement established residence.— The fact that children had lived in their aunt's home for a year, having been placed there by their mother under a foster placement, did not prevent a finding that they were \"residing\" with petitioning-aunt.In re Adoption of Awtrey, 1992-NMCA-118, 114 N.M. 594, 844 P.2d 844.",

A finding by the court that all of the conditions set forth in Subparagraphs (a) through (e) of Paragraph (3) of Subsection B of this section exist shall create a rebuttable presumption of abandonment.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-5-15, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 142; 1995, ch. 206, § 33; 2022, ch. 41, § 60.\n\nCross references.— For the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978,see25 U.S.C. § 1901.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective July 1, 2022, removed a provision related to Indian children which is now covered by the Indian Family Protection Act; and deleted former Subsection D, which provided \"The termination of parental rights involving an Indian child shall comply with the requirements of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978.\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2022, ch. 41, § 73 provided that the provisions of Laws 2022, ch. 41 apply to all cases filed on or after July 1, 2022.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, substituted \"the Adoption Act\" for \"this article\" in Subsection A, in Subsection B, added Subparagraph (3)(f) and made minor stylistic changes in Subparagraphs (3)(d) and (3)(e), and inserted \"Subparagraph (a) through (e) of\" in Subsection C.\n\nA biological father's conduct prior to a child's birthcannot be used as a basis for finding that the father caused the disintegration of the parent-child relationship.Helen G. v.

If the parents are separated and living in different communities, in order to hold a noncustodial parent responsible for the neglect of the parent having actual physical custody of the child, it must be established that the noncustodial parent knew or should have known of the condition of the child, that the child was without proper care by the custodial parent because of the faults or habits of that parent, and when able to do so, to provide that care.In re Adoption of J.J.B., 1993-NMCA-145, 117 N.M. 31, 868 P.2d 1256,rev'd in part on other grounds, 1995-NMSC-026, 119 N.M. 638, 894 P.2d 994, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 860, 116 S.

Venue shall be in the court for the county in which the child is physically present or in the county from which the child was placed. The proceeding may be initiated by any of the following:\n\n(1) the department;\n\n(2) an agency; or\n\n(3) any other person having a legitimate interest in the matter, including a petitioner for adoption, the child's guardian, the child's guardian ad litem or attorney in another action, a foster parent, a relative of the child or the child.\n\nB. A petition for termination of parental rights shall be signed and verified by the petitioner, be filed with the court and set forth:\n\n(1) the date, place of birth and marital status of the child, if known;\n\n(2) the grounds for termination and the facts and circumstances supporting the grounds for termination;\n\n(3) the names and addresses of the person, authorized agency or agency officer to whom custody might be transferred;\n\n(4) the basis for the court's jurisdiction;\n\n(5) that the petition is in contemplation of adoption;\n\n(6) the relationship or legitimate interest of the applicant to the child; and\n\n(7) whether the child is an Indian child.\n\nC. Notice of the filing of the petition, accompanied by a copy of the petition, shall be served by the petitioner on the parents of the child, the child's guardian, the legal custodian of the child, the person with whom the child is residing, the individuals with whom the child has resided within the past six months and the department. Service shall be in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts for the service of process in a civil action in this state, with the exception that the department may be served by certified mail. The notice shall state specifically that the person served shall file a written response to the petition within twenty days if the person intends to contest the termination.\n\nD. If the identification or whereabouts of a parent is unknown, the petitioner shall file a motion for an order granting service by publication or an order stating that service by publication is not required. A motion for an order granting service by publication shall be supported by the affidavit of the petitioner, the agency or the petitioner's attorney detailing the efforts made to locate the parent. Upon being satisfied that reasonable efforts to locate the parent have been made and that information as to the identity or whereabouts of the parent is still insufficient to effect service in accordance with SCRA, Rule 1-004, the court shall order service by publication or order that publication is not required because the parent's consent is not required pursuant to the provisions of Section 32A-5-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nE. The court shall, upon request, appoint counsel for an indigent parent who is unable to obtain counsel or if, in the court's discretion, appointment of counsel for an indigent parent is required in the interest of justice. Payment for the appointed counsel shall be made by the petitioner pursuant to the rate determined by the supreme court of New Mexico for court-appointed attorneys.\n\nF. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the child in all contested proceedings for termination of parental rights. If the child is fourteen years of age or older and in the custody of the department, the child's attorney appointed pursuant to the Abuse and Neglect Act [Chapter 32A, Article 4 NMSA 1978] shall represent the child in any proceedings for termination of parental rights under this section.\n\nG. Within thirty days after the filing of a petition to terminate parental rights, the petitioner shall request a hearing on the petition. The hearing date shall be at least thirty days after service is effected upon the parent of the child or completion of publication.\n\nH. The grounds for any attempted termination shall be proved by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nI. If the court terminates parental rights, it shall appoint a custodian for the child. Upon entering an order terminating the parental rights of a parent, the court may commit the child to the custody of the department, the petitioner or an agency willing to accept custody for the purpose of placing the child for adoption.\n\nJ. A judgment of the court terminating parental rights divests the parent of all legal rights. Termination of parental rights shall not affect the child's right of inheritance through the former parent.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-5-16, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 143; 1997, ch. 34, § 11; 2001, ch. 162, § 3; 2009, ch. 239, § 54; 2022, ch. 41, § 61.\n\nCross references.— For termination procedures in abuse and neglect cases,see32A-4-29 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts,see1-001 NMRA.\n\nFor process in the Children's Court,seeRule 10-103 NMRA.\n\nFor the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978,see25 U.S.C. § 1901.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective July 1, 2022, removed provisions related to Indian children which are now covered by the Indian Family Protection Act; in Subsection B, deleted Subparagraphs B(7)(a) through B(7)(c); in Subsection C, deleted \"In any case involving an Indian child, notice shall also be served on the child's Indian tribe pursuant to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978\"; in Subsection H, deleted \"In any proceeding involving an Indian child, the grounds for any attempted termination shall be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and meet the requirements set forth in the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978\"; and in Subsection I, deleted \"In any termination proceeding involving an Indian child, the court shall, in any termination order, make specific findings that the requirements of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 were met\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2022, ch. 41, § 73 provided that the provisions of Laws 2022, ch. 41 apply to all cases filed on or after July 1, 2022.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Paragraph (3) of Subsection A, after \"guardian ad litem\", added \"or attorney\" and in Subsection F, added the last sentence.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, deleted \"an agency\" preceding \"a foster parent\" in Paragraph A(3); substituted \"the individuals\" for \"any person\" in Subsection C; and in Subsection E substituted \"an indigent parent who is unable\" for \"any parent who is unable\", deleted \"for financial reasons\" following \"to obtain counsel\", inserted \"for an indigent parent\" following \"appointment of council\" and inserted \"pursuant to the rate determined by the supreme court of New Mexico for court-appointed attorneys\" at the end of the subsection.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective July 1, 1997, made a minor stylistic change in Subsection C; and in Subsection D, divided the former first sentence into the present first and second sentences by inserting the language \"or an order stating that service by publication is not required. A motion for an order granting service by publication shall be\", and, at the end of the third sentence, added \"or order that publication is not required because the parent's consent is not required pursuant to the provisions of Section 32A-5-19 NMSA 1978\".\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-55 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nWaiver of objection to venue.— Mother, who appealed district court's judgment terminating her parental rights, waived her claim of improper venue, where she failed to raise her venue-statute objection at a time when any error could have been cured promptly.In re Kenny F., 1990-NMCA-004, 109 N.M. 472, 786 P.2d 699,overruled on other grounds by,In re Adoption of J.J.B., 1993-NMCA-145, 117 N.M. 31, 868 P.2d 1256;rev'd in part on other grounds, 1995-NMSC-026, 119 N.M. 638, 894 P.2d 994, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 860, 116 S. Ct. 168, 133 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1995).\n\nAppointment of counsel not required.— Where the parent did not request counsel and there was nothing in the record to indicate that the parent was indigent at the time of the consent hearing or that justice required the appointment of counsel, and the parent participated in the consent hearing, asked questions of witnesses, testified, and made a statement on the parent's own behalf, the parent did not show that the parent was entitled to counsel at the consent hearing.In re Adoption of Homer F., 2009-NMCA-082, 146 N.M. 845, 215 P.3d 783.\n\nThe court must advise parent of right to counsel upon a showing of indigency.— In a termination of parental rights proceeding, where the mother's indigency was pointed out to the court at the first hearing, it was incumbent upon the court to advise the mother of her statutory right to counsel upon a showing of indigency, and the district court's failure to do so violated the mother's rights under the Adoption Act and was in derogation of the mother's due process rights.In re Adoption Petition of Darla D. v. Grace R., 2016-NMCA-093.\n\nDistrict court has a duty to inquire about the adequacy of a guardian ad litem.— In a termination of parental rights proceeding, where the guardian ad litem was selected by petitioners' counsel, where the record was silent as to what information, if any, the guardian ad litem received from petitioners concerning the case, and where the guardian ad litem was not present at the hearing on her appointment, the judicial duty to ensure that procedures implicating a parent's due process rights are conducted with scrupulous fairness required the district court to confirm the guardian ad litem was properly informed as to her responsibilities under New Mexico law, was not biased and was able to adequately represent the child's interest; the district court's failure to inquire about the adequacy of the guardian ad litem's representation of the child's interest was an abuse of discretion.In re Adoption Petition of Darla D. v. Grace R., 2016-NMCA-093.\n\nLack of notice of issue of continuation of parental rights violates mother's due process rights.— Since the issue of termination of parental rights was not raised in the pleadings, nor properly tried and was mentioned for the first time after closing arguments, when counsel for the father made an oral motion that the parental rights of the mother be terminated, the procedural due process rights of the mother were violated as she was never given notice that the continuation of her parental rights was at issue, she did not have a full opportunity to prepare her case and, consequently, she was not given a full and fair hearing.In re Arnall, 1980-NMSC-052, 94 N.M. 306, 610 P.2d 193.\n\nSufficiency of notice.— Although the summons served upon a father in a termination of parental rights action did not meet the requirements in the statute, there was no showing that the father was prejudiced by the various errors in the notice.Ronald A. v. State ex rel. Human Servs. Dep't, 1990-NMSC-071, 110 N.M. 454, 794 P.2d 371.\n\nPrior proceeding concerned with the fact of neglect is not a jurisdictional barto a later, separate termination proceeding.In re Doe, 1982-NMCA-115, 98 N.M. 442, 649 P.2d 510.\n\nSince neglect proceedings do not result in final judgment on merits,the department is not barred under the \"judgments\" rule from later bringing termination proceedings.In re Doe, 1982-NMCA-115, 98 N.M. 442, 649 P.2d 510.\n\nVerification of pleadings.— Although the human services department [health care authority department] failed to obtain the court's permission prior to filing its amended petitions to terminate parental rights, the court granted permission to file the final amended petition and verification prior to the commencement of trial. Allowance of this amendment rectified any insufficiency in the earlier pleadings not being verified. The court, therefore, was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction.Laurie R. v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 1988-NMCA-055, 107 N.M. 529, 760 P.2d 1295.\n\nAuthority of court after mother's consent declared invalid.— Since the mother's consent to adoption has been declared invalid in keeping with the best interests of the child, the trial court retains the power to determine custody in the absence of a legally valid consent, and it is within the authority of the trial court to continue the child in the custody of the couple seeking to adopt her. Although they lacked standing to petition the court for adoption, they were not left without remedy, since they did have standing to seek relief.In re Samantha D., 1987-NMCA-082, 106 N.M. 184, 740 P.2d 1168, cert denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Family Law - New Mexico Expands Due Process Rights of Parents in Termination of Parental Rights: In re Ruth Anne E.,\" 31 N.M.L.

Consent to adoption or relinquishment of parental rights to the department or an agency licensed by the state of New Mexico shall be required of the following:\n\n(1) the adoptee, if fourteen years of age or older, except when the court finds that the adoptee does not have the mental capacity to give consent;\n\n(2) the adoptee's mother;\n\n(3) the adoptee's proposed adoptive parent;\n\n(4) the presumed father of the adoptee;\n\n(5) the adoptee's acknowledged father;\n\n(6) the department or the agency to whom the adoptee has been relinquished that has placed the adoptee for adoption or the department or the agency that has custody of the adoptee; provided, however, that the court may grant the adoption without the consent of the department or the agency if the court finds the adoption is in the best interests of the adoptee and that the withholding of consent by the department or the agency is unreasonable; and\n\n(7) the guardian of the adoptee's parent when, pursuant to provisions of the Uniform Probate Code [Chapter 45 NMSA 1978], that guardian has express authority to consent to adoption.\n\nB.

Mark J. H., 2008-NMSC-002, 143 N.M. 246, 175 P.3d 914.\n\nConsent required to alter parent-child relationship.— Courts are powerless to alter the natural parent-child relationship and create an artificial one in its stead without a consent agreement, unless circumstances exist under which consent is unnecessary or may be waived.Barwin v. Reidy, 1957-NMSC-016, 62 N.M. 183, 307 P.2d 175.\n\nSince adoption may be refused to petitioners who have the strongest endorsement of the parents, it follows that the office of the requirement of consent for adoption is to indicate the willingness of the parents that the natural relationship be swept away and a new one created in its stead.Barwin v. Reidy, 1957-NMSC-016, 62 N.M. 183, 307 P.2d 175.\n\nWritten consent to proposed adoption,duly acknowledged before a notary public, is made the overt act by which the agreement of the parent to an adoption proceeding shall be manifested.Barwin v.

Reidy, 62 N.M. 183, 307 P.2d 175 (1957).\n\nConsent binds no one unless court acts.— The giving of consent in an adoption case is indicative of the subjective state of mind of the parents - expressive only of the individuals and binding no one unless the court shall choose to act thereon.Barwin v. Reidy, 1957-NMSC-016, 62 N.M. 183, 307 P.2d 175.\n\nWhile parents have no property right in their children,as long as they properly discharge their responsibilities they are entitled to the custody and the natural affection and allegiance of their children, who should not be taken from them and given to others by adoption unless the parents have manifested their wish and agreement to do so.Barwin v.

A consent to adoption or relinquishment of parental rights required pursuant to the provisions of the Adoption Act shall be implied by the court if the parent, without justifiable cause, has:\n\n(1) left the adoptee without provision for the child's identification for a period of fourteen days; or\n\n(2) left the adoptee with others, including the other parent or an agency, without provisions for support and without communication for a period of:\n\n(a) three months if the adoptee was under the age of six years at the commencement of the three-month period; or\n\n(b) six months if the adoptee was over the age of six years at the commencement of the six-month period.\n\nB.

Since the entire right may be so lost, there is no reason why a portion of the right, the specification of the persons in whose favor consent to adoption is given, may not be the subject of voluntary waiver.Barwin v.

The purpose of the putative father registry is to protect the parental rights of fathers who affirmatively assume responsibility for children they may have fathered and to expedite adoptions of children whose biological fathers are unwilling to assume responsibility for their children by registering with the putative father registry or otherwise acknowledging their children. The registry does not relieve the obligation of mothers to identify known fathers.\n\nB. A putative father registry shall be established by the department of health to record the names and addresses of:\n\n(1) any person adjudicated by a court of this state to be the father of a child;\n\n(2) any person who has filed with the registry, before or after birth of a child out of wedlock, a notice of intent to claim paternity of the child;\n\n(3) any person who has filed with the registry an instrument acknowledging paternity; or\n\n(4) any person adjudicated by a court of another state or territory of the United States to be the father of an out-of-wedlock child, when a certified copy of the court order has been filed with the registry.\n\nC. A person filing a notice of intent to claim paternity of a child or an acknowledgment of paternity shall include in the notice the following:\n\n(1) his name;\n\n(2) his current address;\n\n(3) the mother's name and any other identifying information requested by the department of health; and\n\n(4) the child's name, if known, and any other identifying information requested by the department of health.\n\nD. If the person filing the notice of intent to claim paternity of a child or acknowledgment changes his address, the person shall notify the department of health of his new address in the manner prescribed by the department of health.\n\nE. A person who has filed a notice of intent to claim paternity may at any time revoke a notice of intent to claim paternity previously filed. Upon receipt by the registry of the notice of revocation, the revoked notice of intent to claim paternity shall be deemed a nullity nunc pro tunc.\n\nF. No registration fee shall be charged for registering the intent to claim paternity of a child or acknowledgment of paternity. The department of health may charge a reasonable fee as prescribed by regulation for processing searches of the putative father registry.\n\nG. An unrevoked notice of intent to claim paternity of a child may be introduced in evidence by any party in any proceeding in which that fact may be relevant.\n\nH. If a father-child relationship has not been established pursuant to the New Mexico Uniform Parentage Act [40-11A-101 to 40-11A-106 NMSA 1978], a petitioner for adoption of or termination of parental rights regarding a child shall obtain a certificate of search of the putative father registry.\n\nI. If a petitioner for adoption of or termination of parental rights regarding a child has reason to believe that the conception or birth of the child may have occurred in another state, the petitioner shall also obtain a certificate of search from the putative father registry, if any, in that state.\n\nJ. The department of health shall furnish to the requester a certificate of search of the registry on request of any court, a state agency, the department, the petitioner's attorney or the mother of the child. The information shall not be disclosed to any other person, except upon order of the court for good cause shown. The requester shall furnish the department with a stamped, self-addressed reply envelope.\n\nK. A certificate provided by the department of health shall be signed on behalf of the department of health and state that:\n\n(1) a search has been made of the registry; and\n\n(2) a registration containing the information required to identify the registrant:\n\n(a) has been found and is attached to the certificate of search; or\n\n(b) has not been found.\n\nL.

Subject to any rules established by the New Mexico supreme court, a certificate of search of the registry of paternity in this or another state is admissible in a proceeding for adoption of or termination of parental rights regarding a child and, if relevant, in other legal proceedings.\n\nN. The department of health may promulgate any regulations or forms necessary to implement the provisions of this section.\n\nO. Any person who intentionally and unlawfully releases information from the putative father registry to the public or makes any other unlawful use of the information in violation of the provisions of this section is guilty of a petty misdemeanor and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-19-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-5-20, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 147; 2009, ch. 215, § 18.\n\nCross references.— For birth registration,see24-14-13 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective January 1, 2010, deleted former Subsection H, which provided for disclosure of the names and addresses of persons listed with the registry and added Subsections H through M.",

Unconditional consents or relinquishments are preferred, and, therefore, conditional consents or relinquishments shall be for good cause and approved by the court. However, if the condition is for a specific petitioner or the condition requires the other parent to consent before the decree of adoption is entered, the condition shall be deemed for good cause. In any event, all conditions permitted under this subsection shall be met within one hundred eighty days of the execution of the conditional consent or relinquishment or the conclusion of any litigation concerning the petition for adoption.

A hearing before the court for the purpose of taking a consent or relinquishment shall be heard by the court within seven days of request for setting.\n\nG. No consent to adoption or relinquishment of parental rights shall be valid if executed within forty-eight hours after the adoptee's birth.\n\nH. A consent to or relinquishment for adoption shall not be withdrawn prior to the entry of a decree of adoption unless the court finds, after notice and opportunity to be heard is afforded to the petitioner, to the person seeking the withdrawal and to the agency placing a child for adoption, that the consent or relinquishment was obtained by fraud.

Only a prospective adoptive parent, acting alone, through an agency or through an attorney who is licensed in this state, shall make payments for services relating to the adoption or to the placement of the adoptee for adoption for allowed expenses only to third-party vendors, as reasonably practical. These payments shall consist of reasonable and actual fees or charges for:\n\n(1) the services of an agency in connection with an adoption;\n\n(2) medical, hospital, nursing, pharmaceutical, traveling or other similar expenses incurred by a mother or the adoptee in connection with the birth or any illness of an adoptee;\n\n(3) reasonable counseling services relating to the adoption;\n\n(4) living expenses of a mother and her dependent children, including the adoptee, for a reasonable time before the birth or placement of the adoptee and for no more than six weeks after the birth or placement of the adoptee;\n\n(5) expenses incurred for the purposes of full disclosure;\n\n(6) legal services, court costs and traveling or other administrative expenses connected with an adoption, including any legal service performed for a parent who consents to the adoption of a child or relinquishes the child to an agency;\n\n(7) preparation of a pre-placement study and of a post-placement report during the pendency of the adoption proceeding; or\n\n(8) any other service or expense the court finds is reasonably necessary for services relating to the adoption or to the placement of the adoptee for adoption.\n\nC. Any person who makes payments that are not permitted pursuant to the provisions of this section is in violation of the Adoption Act and subject to the penalties set forth in Section 32A-5-42 NMSA 1978.\n\nD. Any person who threatens or coerces a parent to complete the relinquishment of parental rights or to complete the consent to an adoption, by demanding repayment of expenses or by any other threat or coercion, shall be liable to the parent for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nE. The accounting required in Subsection A of this section is not applicable to stepparent adoptions or to adoptions under the provisions of the Abuse and Neglect Act [Chapter 32A, Article 4 NMSA 1978], unless ordered by the court.\n\nF.

The parents of the adoptee and the petitioner may agree to contact between the parents and the petitioner or contact between the adoptee and one or more of the parents or contact between the adoptee and relatives of the parents. An agreement shall, absent a finding to the contrary, be presumed to be in the best interests of the child and shall be included in the decree of adoption. The agreement may also include contact between siblings and the adoptee based on a finding that it is in the best interests of the adoptee and the adoptee's siblings and a determination that the siblings' parent, guardian or custodian has consented to the agreement. The contact may include exchange of identifying or nonidentifying information or visitation between the parents or the parents' relatives or the adoptee's siblings and the petitioner or visitation between the parents or the parents' relatives or the adoptee's siblings and the adoptee. An agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall be considered an open adoption.\n\nB. The court may appoint a guardian ad litem for the adoptee. The court shall adopt a presumption in favor of appointing a guardian ad litem for the adoptee when visitation between the biological family and the adoptee is included in an agreement; however, this requirement may be waived by the court for good cause shown. When an adoptive placement is made voluntarily through an agency or pursuant to Section 32A-5-13 NMSA 1978, the court may, in its discretion, appoint a guardian ad litem. If the child is fourteen years of age or older, the court may appoint an attorney for the child. In all adoptions other than those in which the child is placed by the department, the court may assess the parties for the cost of services rendered by the guardian ad litem or the child's attorney. The duties of the guardian ad litem or child's attorney end upon the filing of the decree, unless otherwise ordered by the court.\n\nC. In determining whether the agreement is in the adoptee's best interests, the court shall consider the adoptee's wishes, but the wishes of the adoptee shall not control the court's findings as to the best interests of the adoptee.\n\nD. Every agreement entered into pursuant to provisions of this section shall contain a clause stating that the parties agree to the continuing jurisdiction of the court and to the agreement and understand and intend that any disagreement or litigation regarding the terms of the agreement shall not affect the validity of the relinquishment of parental rights, the adoption or the custody of the adoptee.\n\nE. The court shall retain jurisdiction after the decree of adoption is entered, if the decree contains an agreement for contact, for the purpose of hearing motions brought to enforce or modify an agreement entered into pursuant to the provisions of this section. The court shall not grant a request to modify the agreement unless the moving party establishes that there has been a change of circumstances and the agreement is no longer in the adoptee's best interests.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-5-35, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 162; 1995, ch. 206, § 41; 2001, ch. 162, § 8; 2005, ch. 189, § 68; 2009, ch. 239, § 57.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection A, added the third sentence; and in the fourth sentence, in two places, after \"parent's relatives\", added \"or the adoptee's siblings\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, in Subsection A, provided that an agreement entered into pursuant to the is section shall be considered an open adoption; in Subsection B, provided that the court shall adopt a presumption in favor of appointing a guardian ad litem; that the requirement that the court adopt the presumption may be waived for good cause; that if the child is fourteen years of age or older, the court may appoint an attorney for the child; that in adoptions other than those in which the child is placed by the department, the court may assess the parties costs for the services of the child's attorney and that the duties of the child's guardian ad litem or attorney end upon the filing of the decree; and deleted the former provision in Subsection D that this section does not apply to a biological parent who has voluntarily relinquished parental rights and consented to the adoption.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, in Subsection B, substituted \"included in an agreement\" for \"contemplated\" in the second sentence and added the third sentence; added the last sentence of Subsection D; and inserted \"if the decree contains an agreement for contract\" in Subsection E.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, in Subsection D, made a minor stylistic change and substituted \"terms of the agreement shall not affect the validity of the relinquishment of parental rights, the adoption or the custody\" for \"terms of the agreement after the entry of the decree of adoption shall not affect the validity of the adoption or the custody\".\n\nFormal agreement required.— Open adoption provided by this section requires a formal agreement between birth parents and prospective adoptive parents.Vigil v.

The petitioner and the adoptee shall attend the hearing unless the court for good cause waives a party's appearance. Good cause may include burdensome travel requirements.\n\nB. The petitioner shall file all documents required pursuant to the Adoption Act and serve the department with copies of the documents simultaneously with the request for hearing on the petition for adoption.\n\nC. If any person who claims to be the biological father of the adoptee has appeared before the court and filed a written petition or response seeking custody and assuming financial responsibility of the adoptee, the court shall hear evidence as to the merits of the petition. If the court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the person is not the biological father of the adoptee or that the child was conceived through an act of rape or incest, the petition shall be dismissed and the person shall no longer be a party to the adoption. If the court determines that the person is the biological father of the adoptee, the court shall further determine whether the person qualifies as a presumed or acknowledged father whose consent is necessary for adoption, pursuant to Section 32A-5-17 NMSA 1978. If the court determines that the person is the biological father, but does not qualify as a presumed or acknowledged father, the court shall adjudicate the person's rights pursuant to the provisions of the Adoption Act.\n\nD. If the mother or father of the adoptee has appeared before the court and filed a written petition that alleges the invalidity of the mother's or father's own consent or relinquishment for adoption previously filed in the adoption proceeding, the court shall hear evidence as to the merits of the petition. If the court determines that the allegations have not been proved by a preponderance of the evidence, the petition shall be dismissed. If the court determines that the allegations of the petition are true, the consent or relinquishment for adoption shall be held invalid, and the court shall determine, in the best interests of the adoptee, the person who shall have custody of the child.\n\nE. The petitioner shall present and prove each allegation set forth in the petition for adoption by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nF. The court shall grant a decree of adoption if it finds that the petitioner has proved by clear and convincing evidence that:\n\n(1) the court has jurisdiction to enter a decree of adoption affecting the adoptee;\n\n(2) the adoptee has been placed with the petitioner for a period of ninety days if the adoptee is under the age of one year at the time of placement or for a period of one hundred eighty days if the adoptee is one year of age or older at the time of placement, unless, for good cause shown, the requirement is waived by the court;\n\n(3) all necessary consents, relinquishments, terminations or waivers have been obtained;\n\n(4) the post-placement report required by Section 32A-5-31 NMSA 1978 has been filed with the court;\n\n(5) service of the petition for adoption has been made or dispensed with as to all persons entitled to notice pursuant to provisions of Section 32A-5-27 NMSA 1978;\n\n(6) at least ninety days have passed since the filing of the petition for adoption, except the court may shorten or waive this period of time in cases in which the child is being adopted by a stepparent, a relative or a person named in the child's deceased parent's will pursuant to provisions of Section 32A-5-12 NMSA 1978;\n\n(7) the petitioner is a suitable adoptive parent and the best interests of the adoptee are served by the adoption;\n\n(8) if visitation between the biological family and the adoptee is contemplated, that the visitation is in the child's best interests;\n\n(9) if the adoptee is foreign-born, the child is legally free for adoption and a certificate issued by the United States secretary of state that certifies the adoption as a convention adoption has been filed with the court;\n\n(10) the results of the criminal records check required pursuant to provisions of the Adoption Act have been received and considered; and\n\n(11) if the adoption involves the interstate placement of the adoptee, the requirements of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children [32A-11-1 NMSA 1978] have been met.\n\nG. In addition to the findings required by Subsection F of this section, the court in any decree of adoption shall make findings with respect to each allegation of the petition.\n\nH. If the court determines that any of the requirements for a decree of adoption pursuant to provisions of Subsections E and F of this section have not been met or that the adoption is not in the best interests of the adoptee, the court shall deny the petition and determine, in the best interests of the adoptee, the person who shall have custody of the child.\n\nI. The decree of adoption shall include the new name of the adoptee and shall not include any other name by which the adoptee has been known or the names of the former parents. The decree of adoption shall order that from the date of the decree, the adoptee shall be the child of the petitioner and accorded the status set forth in Section 32A-5-37 NMSA 1978.\n\nJ. A decree of adoption shall be entered within six months of the filing of the petition if the adoptee is under the age of one year at the time of placement or twelve months if the adoptee is one year of age or older at the time of placement, except that the time may be extended by the court upon request of any of the parties or upon the court's own motion for good cause shown.\n\nK. A decree of adoption may not be attacked upon the expiration of one year from the entry of the decree.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-5-36, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 163; 1995, ch. 206, § 42; 2003, ch. 294, § 5; 2003, ch. 321, § 5; 2022, ch. 41, § 67.\n\nCross references.— For the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978,see25 U.S.C. § 1901.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective July 1, 2022, removed provisions related to Indian children which are now covered by the Indian Family Protection Act; in Subsection F, deleted former Paragraphs F(11) and F(12) and redesignated former Paragraph F(13) as Paragraph F(11); in Subsection K, deleted \"provided, however, that in any adoption involving an Indian child, the Indian child's parent or Indian custodian may petition the court pursuant to the provisions of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 to invalidate the adoption.\"; and deleted Subsection L.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2022, ch. 41, § 73 provided that the provisions of Laws 2022, ch. 41 apply to all cases filed on or after July 1, 2022.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, substituted \"documents\" for \"same\" near the middle of Subsection B; inserted \"and a certificate issued by the United States secretary of state that certifies the adoption as a convention adoption has been filed with the court\" following \"free for adoption\" at the end of Paragraph F(9); and substituted \"the Adoption Act\" for \"Section 32A-5-14 NMSA 1978\" following \"pursuant to provisions of\" near the middle of Paragraph F(10). Laws 2003, ch. 294, § 5 and Laws 2003, ch. 321, § 5 enacted identical amendments to this section. The section was set out as amended by Laws 2003, ch. 321, § 5.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, substituted \"32A-5-17\" for \"32-5-17\" near the end of Subsection C; in Subsection F, substituted \"32A-5-31\" for \"32-5-31\" in Paragraph (4), substituted \"32A-5-27\" for \"32-5-27\" in Paragraph (5), substituted \"32A-5-12\" for \"32-5-12\" in Paragraph (6), and substituted \"32A-5-14\" for \"32-5-14\" in Paragraph (10); corrected the subsection reference in Subsection G; in Subsection I, substituted \"32A-5-37\" for \"32-5-37\"; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 40-7-49 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nJurisdiction to determine custody, adoption or other disposition.— Since court had jurisdiction of the petitions relating to certain children upon the basis they were abandoned children, it was within the jurisdiction of the court: (a) to return these children to the custody of their natural parents; or, (b) to grant the petitions for the adoption of the children; or, (c) to refuse either of the foregoing, and make other temporary or permanent disposition and provision for these children, all to be determined upon one single consideration - the welfare of the children.Barwin v. Reidy, 1957-NMSC-016, 62 N.M. 183, 307 P.2d 175.\n\nPersonal jurisdiction required.— An integral facet of a valid adoption is the requirement that personal jurisdiction must first be acquired by the court over the parties seeking to adopt the child, over the child, and over the parents of the child, and any guardian or agency having custody or control of the child.In re Adoption of Bradfield, 1982-NMCA-047, 97 N.M. 611, 642 P.2d 214.\n\nConsent considered before merits of adoption.— The court has no right to consider the merits or demerits of an adoption petition insofar as it concerns the welfare of a child, unless it has in the first instance determined that the consent of a natural parent may be dispensed with.Nevelos v. Railston, 1959-NMSC-013, 65 N.M. 250, 335 P.2d 573.\n\nParent did not qualify as an acknowledged father.— Where the biological father of the child knew that the mother was pregnant; the father registered with the putative father registry after receiving notice of the pending adoption of the child and two months after the child's birth and placement with the adoptive parents; and the father filed a petition in the adoption proceeding to establish paternity, the father was not an \"acknowledged father\" and had no statutory right to withhold consent to the child's adoption.Helen G. v. Mark J. H., 2008-NMSC-002, 143 N.M. 246, 175 P.3d 914.\n\nParents' knowledge of identity of petitioners not condition of jurisdiction.— As the court may or may not decree adoption in favor of persons recommended by the natural parents, it seems most unlikely the legislature intended to impose as a condition to the exercise of the court's jurisdiction knowledge of the identity of petitioners in adoption on the part of the natural parents because even when that circumstance exists, and possibly the further circumstance that the natural parents have investigated the qualifications of the petitioners and given them their unqualified approval, the court may still refuse to decree adoption, the selection of a foster parent being a judicial act and the responsibility being that of the court.Barwin v. Reidy, 1957-NMSC-016, 62 N.M. 183, 307 P.2d 175.\n\nChild's welfare paramount.— The paramount issue in an adoption proceeding is the welfare of the child.In re Adoption of Bradfield, 1982-NMCA-047, 97 N.M. 611, 642 P.2d 214.\n\nWelfare of child not measured altogether by economic factors.— In an adoption proceeding, the welfare and best interest of a child are not measured altogether by material and economic factors; parental love and affection must find some place in the scheme.Gutierrez v. N.M. Dep't of Pub. Welfare, 1964-NMSC-129, 74 N.M. 273, 393 P.2d 12.\n\nCounseling not grounds for reopening adoption.— The fact that the mother had not received pre-consent counseling was not a proper ground upon which to reopen an adoption.In re Adoption of Drummond, 1997-NMCA-094, 123 N.M. 727, 945 P.2d 457.\n\nAdoption denied where only for securing greater social security check.— Although there is no contention that the petitioner's home was not a proper one, nor is there any intimation that either the petitioner or the natural mother was not a proper person to have custody of the children, the adoption was denied as it was an adoption in name only, lacking all of the elements of the complete severance of the children's ties and relationship with their mother contemplated by the law and within the intent of New Mexico adoption statutes as it was only for the purpose of securing a greater social security check.Gutierrez v. N.M. Dep't of Pub. Welfare, 1964-NMSC-129, 74 N.M. 273, 393 P.2d 12.\n\nEntry of order without effect where no adoption existed.— While an order of adoption may be entered nunc pro tunc to cure irregularities that do not affect the jurisdiction of the court, it cannot serve to bring into existence an adoption when no adoption could in fact be deemed to have existed before.In re Adoption of Bradfield, 1982-NMCA-047, 97 N.M. 611, 642 P.2d 214.\n\nAuthority of court after mother's consent declared invalid.— Where the mother's consent to adoption has been declared invalid in keeping with the best interests of the child, the trial court retains the power to determine custody in the absence of a legally valid consent, and it is within the authority of the trial court to continue the child in the custody of the couple seeking to adopt her. Although they lacked standing to petition the court for adoption, they were not left without remedy, since they did have standing to seek relief.In re Samantha D., 1987-NMCA-082, 106 N.M. 184, 740 P.2d 1168, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.\n\nDeath of child prior to final hearing.— The granting of an adoption where the child sought to be adopted has died prior to the final hearing has no effect, as the death deprives the trial court of jurisdiction.In re Adoption of Bradfield, 1982-NMCA-047, 97 N.M. 611, 642 P.2d 214.\n\nCourt may grant or refuse revocation of consent prior to decree.— Prior to the entry of an adoption decree, the court may grant or refuse revocation of consent, giving due consideration to the circumstances in the particular case, as, for example, the matters giving rise to execution of consent in the first place, a showing or failure to show change of those matters; the situation of the proposed adoptive parents; the length of time which has elapsed since consent has been given; the extent to which the adoptive petitions have relied and acted upon the consent; and all those matters pertaining to the past, present and future welfare of the child.Barwin v. Reidy, 1957-NMSC-016, 62 N.M. 183, 307 P.2d 175.\n\nConsent may not be arbitrarily revoked.— All that New Mexico statutes require is that consent be filed in the proceedings. Consent may not be arbitrarily revoked prior to adoption, at least where the petitioners for adoption have acted upon the consent and taken the child into their home.Barwin v. Reidy, 1957-NMSC-016, 62 N.M. 183, 307 P.2d 175.\n\nVisitation rights of nonparent.— Although granting visitation in an adoption case to a nonparent does affect a parent's custody rights, this is not sufficient reason to apply a blanket rule against such decrees. If at some time the visitation is no longer in the child's best interests, the court may reconsider it. However, because granting visitation rights does infringe on a parent's custody, it is appropriate to limit this decision to situations when the party seeking visitation has acted in a custodial or parental capacity.In re Adoption of Francisco A., 1993-NMCA-144, 116 N.M. 708, 866 P.2d 1175.\n\nConsent presumed in child's best interest, absent fraud.— Where natural mother pled on motion to revoke consent that the consent was involuntary in that it was signed too soon after birth, while in the hospital, and while in a state of emotional upset, such petition failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, since legislature, by enactment of this section, created a presumption that once there has been a consent by the natural parent, absent fraud, it is in the best interests of the child to proceed with the adoption.In re Adoption of Doe, 1975-NMCA-009, 87 N.M. 253, 531 P.2d 1226, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 239, 531 P.2d 1212.\n\nChallenges to decree.— By statutorily placing a definite time limitation for attacking adoption decrees, the legislature intended to ensure that adopted children were given status equal to that of children begotten by marriage; therefore, father's motion for relief from judgment filed five years after the final adoption decree was entered was time-barred.In re Adoption of Webber, 1993-NMCA-099, 116 N.M. 47, 859 P.2d 1074.\n\n\"Exceptional circumstance\" exception to one-year limitation.— Where the best interests of the child demand it, the exceptional circumstance provision of 1-060B (6) NMRA should be used to override the one-year statute of limitations on reopening an adoption decree.In re Adoption of Drummond, 1997-NMCA-094, 123 N.M. 727, 945 P.2d 457.",

In stepparent adoptions, the adoptee shall take the new name designated by the petitioner in the petition so long as the petitioner's spouse and the child, if over the age of fourteen years, consent to the new name. The name change need not be requested in the petition.\n\nB. After adoption, the adoptee and the petitioner shall sustain the legal relation of parent and child as if the adoptee were the biological child of the petitioner and the petitioner were the biological parent of the child. The adoptee shall have all rights and be subject to all of the duties of that relation, including the right of inheritance from and through the petitioner, and the petitioner shall have all rights and be subject to all duties of that relation, including right of inheritance from and through the adoptee.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-5-37, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 164; 2005, ch. 189, § 69.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, changed \"ten years\" to \"fourteen years\" and provided that the name change need not be requested in the petition in Subsection A.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 40-7-52 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nAdoption, by all tests, is a status like any other relational status.— It is created by acts of the parties plus the effect of law; it is a relationship which cannot be terminated by the sole will of the parties; it is the source of a bundle of rights, duties and obligations, and is of great interest to the state. It should, then, be treated by the courts in the same way they treat other types of domestic status.Delaney v. First Nat'l Bank, 1963-NMSC-160, 73 N.M. 192, 386 P.2d 711.\n\nAdopted children in same legal position as those begotten by marriage.— The legislature has evinced an understanding that adopted children should be placed in the same legal position and are to receive the same consideration as children begotten by the marriage.Hahn v. Sorgen, 1946-NMSC-015, 50 N.M. 83, 171 P.2d 308.\n\nAdopted child on level with natural child in construing will.— Wills must be construed in harmony with the public policy of placing an adopted child on a level with natural children.Delaney v. First Nat'l Bank, 73 N.M. 192, 386 P.2d 711 (1963).\n\nThe public policy in New Mexico is to treat adopted children the same as natural children. An adopted child is grouped with lineal descendants in determining the amount of the decedent's estate which is exempt from inheritance tax, and also imposes an inheritance tax upon estates passing to parent or parents, husband, wife, lineal descendants or legally adopted child.Delaney v. First Nat'l Bank, 1963-NMSC-160, 73 N.M. 192, 386 P.2d 711.\n\nBoth parents must join adoption application before child heir of both.— A child adopted does not become the heir of both adopting parents unless both join in the application.Dodson v. Ward, 1925-NMSC-046, 31 N.M. 54, 240 P. 991.\n\nChild adopted by stepfather may not inherit from natural paternal grandparent.— Where a child was adopted by her stepfather after her natural father's death, but before her natural paternal grandmother's death, the adopted child could not inherit from her natural grandmother.In re Estate of Holt, 1981-NMSC-011, 95 N.M. 412, 622 P.2d 1032.\n\nChallenges to decree.— By statutorily placing a definite time limitation for attacking adoption decrees, the legislature intended to ensure that adopted children were given status equal to that of children begotten by marriage; therefore, father's motion for relief from judgment filed five years after the final adoption decree was entered was time-barred.In re Adoption of Webber, 1993-NMCA-099, 116 N.M. 47, 859 P.2d 1074.\n\nVisitation rights of nonparent.— Former Section 40-7-52 NMSA 1978 did not limit the children's court's authority to fashion a decree that is in the child's best interests and that includes, if appropriate, visitation rights for third parties with whom the child has close ties. The primary purpose of that statute was to ensure that adopted children can inherit from their adoptive parents.In re Adoption of Francisco A., 1993-NMCA-144, 116 N.M. 708, 866 P.2d 1175.\n\nAm.
