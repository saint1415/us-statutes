Const., art. IV, § 23, was effective June 14, 2019, 90 days after the adjournment of the legislature.\n\nThe child protective services task force is not a public body subject to the Open Meetings Act.— The Open Meetings Act, 10-15-1 to 10-15-4 NMSA 1978, applies to any \"public body\" and the act provides that it applies to all meetings of a quorum of members of any board, commission, administrative adjudicatory body or other policymaking body of any state agency or any agency or authority of any county, municipality, district or political subdivision. The child protective services task force, which was created by a house joint memorial during the 2019 legislative session for the purpose of making recommendations to generally improve the safety and well-being of children in the care of the child protective services system, is not subject to the Open Meetings Act, because it is not a policymaking entity as it holds a purely advisory role and exists only to make recommendations to real policymakers.Applicability of Open Meetings Act to Child Protective Services Task Force(1/30/20), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2020-01.",
