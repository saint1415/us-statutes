Approval from the public child placing agency in the receiving state for a provisional or approved placement is required as provided for in the rules of the interstate commission.\n\nE. The procedures for making and the request for an assessment shall contain all information and be in a form as provided for in the rules of the interstate commission.\n\nF. Upon receipt of a request from the public child placing agency of the sending state, the receiving state shall initiate an assessment of the proposed placement to determine its safety and suitability.

The interstate commission may develop uniform standards for the assessment of the safety and suitability of interstate placements.\n\nARTICLE 6. PLACEMENT AUTHORITY\n\nA. Except as otherwise provided in this compact, no child subject to this compact shall be placed into a receiving state until approval for such placement is obtained.\n\nB. If the public child placing agency in the receiving state does not approve the proposed placement, then the child shall not be placed. The receiving state shall provide written documentation of any such determination in accordance with the rules promulgated by the interstate commission.

If the proposed placement is not approved, any interested party shall have standing to seek an administrative review of the receiving state's determination;\n\n(1) the administrative review and any further judicial review associated with the determination shall be conducted in the receiving state pursuant to its applicable administrative procedures act; and\n\n(2) if a determination not to approve the placement of the child in the receiving state is overturned upon review, the placement shall be deemed approved; provided, however, that all administrative or judicial remedies have been exhausted or the time for such remedies has passed.\n\nARTICLE 7.

The public child placing agency in the receiving state shall provide, or arrange for the provision of, supervision and services for the child, including timely reports, during the period of the placement.\n\nE. Nothing in this compact shall be construed as to limit the authority of the public child placing agency in the receiving state from contracting with a licensed agency or person in the receiving state for an assessment or the provision of supervision or services for the child or otherwise authorizing the provision of supervision or services by a licensed agency during the period of placement.\n\nF. Each member state shall provide for coordination among its branches of government concerning the state's participation in, and compliance with, the compact and interstate commission activities through the creation of an advisory council or use of an existing body or board.\n\nG.

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.

The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states.\n\nC. The interstate commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the interstate commission pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by and with the authority of the member states.\n\nD. The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws.

The interstate commission may propose amendments to this compact for enactment by the member states. No amendment shall become effective and binding on the member states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the member states.\n\nARTICLE 15. WITHDRAWAL AND DISSOLUTION\n\nA. Withdrawal:\n\n(1) once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every member state; provided that a member state may withdraw from the compact specifically repealing the statute that enacted the compact into law;\n\n(2) withdrawal from this compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same. The effective date of withdrawal shall be the effective date of the repeal of the statute;\n\n(3) the withdrawing state shall immediately notify the president of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state.

Binding Effect of the Compact:\n\n(1) all lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the interstate commission, are binding upon the member states;\n\n(2) all agreements between the interstate commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms; and\n\n(3) in the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any member state, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that member state.\n\nARTICLE 18. INDIAN NATIONS, TRIBES AND PUEBLOS\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision in this compact, the interstate commission may promulgate guidelines to permit Indian nations, tribes and pueblos to utilize the compact to achieve any or all of the purposes of the compact as specified in Article 1.
