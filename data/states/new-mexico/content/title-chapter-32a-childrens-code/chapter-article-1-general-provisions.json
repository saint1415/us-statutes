      "text": "The Children's Code shall be interpreted and construed to effectuate the following legislative purposes:\n\nA. first to provide for the care, protection and wholesome mental and physical development of children coming within the provisions of the Children's Code and then to preserve the unity of the family whenever possible. A child's health and safety shall be the paramount concern. Permanent separation of a child from the child's family, however, would especially be considered when the child or another child of the parent has suffered permanent or severe injury or repeated abuse. It is the intent of the legislature that, to the maximum extent possible, children in New Mexico shall be reared as members of a family unit;\n\nB. to provide judicial and other procedures through which the provisions of the Children's Code are executed and enforced and in which the parties are assured a fair hearing and their constitutional and other legal rights are recognized and enforced;\n\nC. to provide a continuum of services for children and their families, from prevention to treatment, considering whenever possible prevention, diversion and early intervention, particularly in the schools;\n\nD. to provide children with services that are sensitive to their cultural needs;\n\nE. to reduce overrepresentation of minority children and families in the juvenile justice, family services and abuse and neglect systems through early intervention, linkages to community support services and the elimination of discrimination;\n\nF. to provide for the cooperation and coordination of the civil and criminal systems for investigation, intervention and disposition of cases, to minimize interagency conflicts and to enhance the coordinated response of all agencies to achieve the best interests of a child victim; and\n\nG. to provide continuity for children and families appearing before the children's court by assuring that, whenever possible, a single judge hears all successive cases or proceedings involving a child or family.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-1-3, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 12; 1999, ch. 77, § 1; 2009, ch. 239, § 6.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, in Subsection A added the second sentence and in the next-to-last sentence inserted \"or another child of the parent has\".\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, added Subsection E.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 239, § 71, provided that the provisions of this act apply to all children who, on July 1, 2009, are on release or are otherwise eligible to be placed on release as if the Juvenile Public Safety Advisory Board Act had been in effect at the time they were placed on release or became eligible to be released.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-2 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— The New Mexico constitution and double jeopardy statute, Section 30-1-10 NMSA 1978, do not prohibit the state from prosecuting defendants for child abuse because CYFD previously investigated defendants for child abuse and the tribal court previously held a custody hearing on the same issues. In the previous proceedings, the civil sanctions imposed on the defendant were remedial rather than punitive.State v. Diggs, 2009-NMCA-099, 147 N.M. 122, 217 P.3d 608, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 362, 223 P.3d 359.\n\nIntent of code.— The Children's Code is intended to protect children from the consequences of their own acts so long as it is \"consistent with the protection of the public interest,\" and it establishes a system of treatment, care and rehabilitation for children who have committed either \"delinquent acts\" or who are neglected or in need of supervision.State v. Favela, 1978-NMSC-010, 91 N.M. 476, 576 P.2d 282,overruled on other grounds byState v. Pitts, 1986-NMSC-011, 103 N.M. 778, 714 P.2d 582.\n\nThe Children's Code has as its central focus children who are alleged to be delinquent, in need of supervision, abused, or neglected.In re Guardianship of Lupe C., 1991-NMCA-050, 112 N.M. 116, 812 P.2d 365.\n\nWith respect to neglected children, the legislative purposes contained in the Children's Code emphasize a legislative objective of keeping the family together whenever possible, separating the child from his parents and family only when necessary for his welfare, and providing services to assist the child and the family.In re Guardianship of Lupe C., 1991-NMCA-050, 112 N.M. 116, 812 P.2d 365.\n\nBest interests of children is paramount consideration.— Parents do not have an absolute right to their children, for any right is secondary to the best interests and welfare of the children.In re Samantha D., 1987-NMCA-082, 106 N.M. 184, 740 P.2d 1168, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.\n\nProceedings to further stated purposes and policies.— The court is expected to conduct children's court proceedings in a manner that will further the purposes and policies stated in this section.State v. Doe, 1981-NMCA-140, 97 N.M. 263, 639 P.2d 72, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039, and cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1136, 102 S. Ct. 2965, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1354 (1982).\n\nChildren's Code must be read in entiretyand each section interpreted so as to correlate as faultlessly as possible with all other sections, in order that the ends sought to be accomplished by the legislature shall not be thwarted.State v. Doe, 1980-NMCA-147, 95 N.M. 88, 619 P.2d 192.\n\nParents' right to custody not absolute.— Parents have a natural and legal right to custody of their children. This right is prima facie and not an absolute right. This right, however, must yield when the best interests and welfare of the child are at issue.Roberts v. Staples, 1968-NMSC-109, 79 N.M. 298, 442 P.2d 788.\n\nPlacement with one other than minor's parent.— The court did not violate the spirit and intent of the Children's Code by placing a 16-year-old girl in the custody of a woman who had helped to rear her and had been found to be a positive influence over her where the child felt compelled to run away from her mother's household and would in all likelihood continue to refuse to live with her mother since the children's court is vested with a broad discretion in hearing and deciding matters under it.In re Doe, 1975-NMCA-131, 88 N.M. 505, 542 P.2d 1195.\n\nCommittal to youth authority in best interests of child.— Since the evidence revealed that a child committing involuntary manslaughter had engaged in other violent behavior, the children's court could have reasonably determined that transferring the custody of the child to the youth authority was consistent with the child's best interests, the interests of the child's family, and the interests of the public.State v. Cody R., 1991-NMCA-127, 113 N.M. 140, 823 P.2d 940, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 23, 821 P.2d 1060.\n\nSubject of act adequately expressed in title.— Since the \"subject\" of the act is children and that subject is clearly expressed, a provision within the act authorizing a change in the custody of a neglected child is a detail provided for accomplishing the legislative purpose of protecting children and such detail need not be set forth in the title of the bill to comply with the requirement of N.M. Const., art. IV, § 16, that the subject of every bill be clearly expressed in its title.State ex rel. Health & Soc. Servs. Dep't v. Natural Father, 1979-NMCA-090, 93 N.M. 222, 598 P.2d 1182.\n\nRight to be treated as childis a statutory, not a constitutional, right.State v. Doe, 1978-NMCA-025, 91 N.M. 506, 576 P.2d 1137.\n\nSame constitutional standards apply to juveniles as to adults.State v. Henry, 1967-NMSC-265, 78 N.M. 573, 434 P.2d 692.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment on Neller v. State, 79 N.M. 528, 445 P.2d 949 (1968), see 9 Nat. Resources J. 310 (1969).\n\nFor survey, \"Children's Court Practice in Delinquency and Need of Supervision Cases Under the New Rules,\" see 6 N.M.L. Rev. 331 (1976).\n\nFor article, \"The New Mexico Children's Code: Some Remaining Problems,\" see 10 N.M.L. Rev. 341 (1980).\n\nFor note, \"Children's Code - Neglect - State ex rel.

Children, Youth & Families Dep't (In re Candice Y.), 2000-NMCA-035, 128 N.M. 813, 999 P.2d 1045, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 207, 4 P.3d 35.\n\nHuman services department [health care authority department] not \"person\".— State health and social services (now human services) department was not a \"person\" within the meaning of the Children's Code. Thus, the department need not be made a party to nor was its presence required in any action filed pursuant to the Children's Code where it may be ordered to assume certain responsibilities pursuant to the Children's Code.In re Doe, 1975-NMCA-152, 88 N.M. 632, 545 P.2d 491.\n\nEx parte conduct rule inapplicable to guardians ad litem.— Rule 16-402 NMRA of the Rules of Professional Conduct does not prohibit guardians ad litem from communicating ex parte with department of children, youth and families social workers; although attorneys, guardians ad litem do not have typical attorney-client relationships with children, and are therefore not bound by that rule.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. George F., 1998-NMCA-119, 125 N.M. 597, 964 P.2d 158, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 654, 964 P.2d 818.\n\nLegal custody provides the right to determine placement of children.— Absent an abuse of its discretion, when the children, youth and families department (department) has legal custody of a child, the department alone is permitted to determine where and with whom the child will be placed.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Jerry K., 2015-NMCA-047, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-004.\n\nWhere father pleaded no contest to the allegation that his children were neglected as a result of father's inability to discharge his responsibilities to and for them because of incarceration, and where the district court ordered the children into the legal custody of the children, youth and families department (department), the department had the sole discretionary authority, absent an abuse of discretion, to decide with whom the children would be placed, despite father's own preferences for placement of the children.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Jerry K., 2015-NMCA-047, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-004.\n\n\"Legal custody\" continues until terminated by appropriate authority.— A parent has a legal right to the custody of his child unless that right had been terminated, however temporarily, by appropriate authority.State v. Sanders, 1981-NMCA-053, 96 N.M. 138, 628 P.2d 1134.\n\nA parent's legal right to custody of a child does not end until entry of, and the giving of notice of, a judgment in compliance with Rule 62(a), N.M.R. Child. Ct. (now 10-352 NMRA), requiring a signed written judgment and disposition.State v. Sanders, 1981-NMCA-053, 96 N.M. 138, 628 P.2d 1134.\n\nAge references are to years of age, not mental age.— The numerous references to age in the Children's Code are references to years of age, not mental age.State v. Doe, 1982-NMCA-028, 97 N.M. 598, 642 P.2d 201, cert denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Navajo Grandparents - 'Parent' or 'Stranger' - A Child Custody Determination,\" see 9 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. There is established in the district court for each county a division to be known as the children's court. The district court of each judicial district shall designate one or more district judges to sit as judge of the children's court.\n\nB. The supreme court shall adopt rules of procedure not in conflict with the Children's Code governing proceedings in the children's court, including rules and procedures for juries.\n\nC. If, in a criminal action, it appears to a court other than the children's court division of the district court that jurisdiction is properly within the children's court division, the other court shall transfer the matter to the children's court division. Upon transfer, the children's court division obtains jurisdiction over the matter for proceedings in accordance with the provisions of the Children's Code.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-1-5, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 14.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-4 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nNo constitutional violation.— Since the 1921 juvenile court law was applicable only to special statutory proceedings set up therein, it did not abrogate the jurisdiction of district courts over minors and therefore was not in violation of N.M. Const., art. VI, § 13.In re Santillanes, 1943-NMSC-011, 47 N.M. 140, 138 P.2d 503.\n\nDivision created.— The Juvenile Code (now Children's Code) created a division of the district court.Peyton v. Nord, 1968-NMSC-027, 78 N.M. 717, 437 P.2d 716.\n\nCourt not inferior to district court.— The N.M. const., art. VI, § 1, authorizing creation of inferior courts did not require that jurisdiction of district courts over juveniles, provided in N.M. const., art. VI, § 13, be transferred to courts inferior to district courts; the juvenile court (now children's court) created in 1955 was not a court inferior to the district court but rather a division of the district court and was constitutionally created.Peyton v. Nord, 1968-NMSC-027, 78 N.M. 717, 437 P.2d 716.\n\nJurisdiction of court.— A condition of probation in a criminal sexual contact case, prohibiting defendant from having direct or indirect contact with all children under the age of 18, including the victim of his crimes, did not amount to a \"de facto\" termination of parental rights, necessitating jurisdiction within the children's court.State v. Garcia, 2005-NMCA-065, 137 N.M. 583, 113 P.3d 406.\n\nRight to disqualify judge.— The fact that the Juvenile Code (now Children's Code) created special procedures and special handling for minors accused of criminal offenses, and no provision is made in the Juvenile Code (now Children's Code) for the disqualification of a juvenile (now children's court) judge, does not mean that the provisions of Section 38-3-9 NMSA 1978 are inapplicable to juvenile (now children's) court proceedings. The juvenile (now children's court) judge is none other than the district judge serving in another division of the district court and the juvenile is a party to the action or proceeding and entitled to exercise the right of disqualification given her by Section 38-3-9 NMSA 1978.Frazier v. Stanley, 1972-NMSC-028, 83 N.M. 719, 497 P.2d 230.\n\nWhen judge not proper respondent in habeas corpus proceeding.— Juvenile (now children's) court justice is not the proper party in habeas corpus proceeding since only the person having the physical custody of a petitioner (here the sheriff), and who is able to produce him in court, may properly be named as respondent in the habeas corpus proceeding.Peyton v. Nord, 1968-NMSC-027, 78 N.M. 717, 437 P.2d 716.\n\nLaw reviews.— For survey, \"Children's Court Practice in Delinquency and Need of Supervision Cases Under the New Rules,\" see 6 N.M.L.

Except as provided by Subsection C, D or E of this section, the children's court attorney may represent the state in any matter arising under the Children's Code when the state is the petitioner or complainant. The children's court attorney shall represent the petitioner in matters arising under the Children's Code when, in the discretion of the judge, the matter presents legal complexities requiring representation by the children's court attorney, whether or not the state is petitioner or complainant, but not in those matters when there is a conflict of interest between the petitioner or complainant and the state. A petitioner or complainant may be represented by counsel in any matter arising under the Children's Code.\n\nC. In cases involving civil abuse or civil neglect and the periodic review of their dispositions, the attorney selected by and representing the department is the children's court attorney. The attorney selected by and representing the department shall provide the district attorney of the appropriate judicial district with a copy of any abuse or neglect petition filed in that judicial district. Upon the request of the district attorney, the attorney selected by and representing the department shall provide the district attorney with reports, investigations and pleadings relating to any abuse or neglect petition.\n\nD. In cases involving families in need of court-ordered services, the periodic review of their dispositions and voluntary placements, the attorney selected by and representing the department is the children's court attorney. The attorney selected by and representing the department shall provide the district attorney of the appropriate judicial district with a copy of any family in need of court-ordered services petition filed in that judicial district. Upon the request of the district attorney, the attorney selected by and representing the department shall provide the district attorney with reports, investigations and pleadings relating to any family in need of court-ordered services petition.\n\nE. In cases involving a child subject to the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act [32A-6A-1 to 32A-6A-30 NMSA 1978] that also involves civil abuse, civil neglect or a family in need of court-ordered services, the attorney selected by and representing the department is the children's court attorney. In cases involving a child subject to the provisions of the Children's Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Act that does not also involve civil abuse, civil neglect or a family in need of court-ordered services, the district attorney is the ex-officio children's court attorney.\n\nF. In those counties where the children's court attorney has sufficient staff and the workload requires it, the children's court attorney may delegate children's court functions to a staff attorney.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-1-6, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 15; 1995, ch. 206, § 3; 2005, ch. 189, § 2.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added the phrase \"court-ordered\" in Subsection D.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, added \"or E\" following \"D\" and made minor stylistic changes in Subsections A and B; in Subsection C, substituted \"with a copy of any abuse or neglect petition\" for \"reports, investigations and pleadings related to charges of abuse and neglect\" and added the last sentence; in Subsection D, substituted the language at the end beginning \"with a copy\" for \"reports, investigations and pleadings related to charges of abuse and neglect filed in that judicial district\"; added Subsection E; and redesignated former Subsection E as Subsection F.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-5 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nJudge's interference with children's court attorney not permitted.— A judge is without authority to direct the juvenile probation office to refrain from referring juvenile cases to the district attorney without the judge's prior written consent, or to relieve the district attorney as children's court attorney and to appoint private attorneys to act and to be compensated out of the district attorney's budget, and to do so constitutes bad faith, malicious abuse of judicial power and willful misconduct in office.In re Martinez, 1982-NMSC-115, 99 N.M. 198, 656 P.2d 861.\n\nAttorney has authority to execute affidavit of disqualification of judge.— The power and duty of the children's court attorney to represent the state necessarily includes the authority to execute an affidavit of disqualification of a judge when the disqualification is done on behalf of the state.Smith v. Martinez, 1981-NMSC-066, 96 N.M. 440, 631 P.2d 1308.\n\nDistrict attorneys' pay.— The legal basis for continuing to pay district attorneys at their pre-Children's Code rate is found in N.M.

This language does not prohibit municipalities from drafting ordinances that proscribe specific conduct of children which is unlawful if committed by adults, however, the procedures within the Children's Code control the manner in which children may be taken into custody, taken into protective custody, or adjudicated. A municipal curfew, which attempted to criminalize behavior involving juveniles, and a program, which purportedly took children into protective custody, implicated the Children's Code procedures and protections.ACLU v.

The construction that this section gives the children's court the exclusive jurisdiction to act and that Section 40-10-15A(1) NMSA 1978 limits when that authority is to be exercised, gives effect to both statutes.State ex rel.

Avinger, 1985-NMCA-097, 104 N.M. 355, 721 P.2d 781,aff'd, 1986-NMSC-032, 104 N.M. 255, 720 P.2d 290 (decided under prior law).\n\nSection 40-10-15A NMSA 1978 limits the court's exercise of jurisdiction in a \"neglected child\" proceeding if that proceeding could result in the modification of another state's custody decree if the other state has not given up jurisdiction.State ex rel. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Avinger, 1986-NMSC-032, 104 N.M. 255, 720 P.2d 290 (decided under prior law).\n\nSubsection B of former Section 32-1-9 NMSA 1978 did not limit district court's jurisdiction.— The words \"exclusive original jurisdiction\" used in Subsection B of former Section 32-1-9 NMSA 1978 (now Section 32A-1-8 NMSA 1978) were not intended to limit or abrogate the jurisdiction of the district court.In re Arnall, 1980-NMSC-052, 94 N.M. 306, 610 P.2d 193.\n\nNeglect proceeding is not bar to termination proceeding.— A prior proceeding concerned with the fact of neglect is not a jurisdictional bar to a later, separate termination proceeding.In re Doe, 1982-NMCA-115, 98 N.M. 442, 649 P.2d 510,overruled byState v. Roper, 1996-NMCA-073, 122 N.M. 126, 921 P.2d 322.\n\nJurisdiction to be affirmatively established when defendant's minority at issue.— Exclusive original jurisdiction over juveniles under 18 years of age is vested in the children's court and where the minority of the defendant appears during the course of the trial, the jurisdiction of the trial court must, at that point, be affirmatively established.Trujillo v. Cox, 1965-NMSC-050, 75 N.M. 257, 403 P.2d 696.\n\nJurisdiction over persons contributing to delinquency of minor.— Insofar as the juvenile law purported to confer \"exclusive original jurisdiction\" on juvenile (now children's) courts over persons contributing to the delinquency of juveniles it was invalid since the constitution vested sole and exclusive jurisdiction for the trial of all felony cases in the district courts.State v. McKinley, 1949-NMSC-010, 53 N.M. 106, 202 P.2d 964.\n\nAge references are to years of age, not mental age.— The numerous references to age in the Children's Code are references to years of age, not mental age.State v. Doe, 1982-NMCA-028, 97 N.M. 598, 642 P.2d 201, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nEffect of petition alleging child in need of supervision.— A child in need of supervision means a child in need of care or rehabilitation, and where the petition alleged that the child was in need of supervision, there was no merit to the claim that the petition was jurisdictionally deficient.In re Doe, 1975-NMCA-131, 88 N.M. 505, 542 P.2d 1195.\n\nVested with sole jurisdiction.— The sole jurisdiction over juveniles in the state of New Mexico has been vested in the juvenile (now children's) court. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-131.\n\nJurisdiction of other courts.— There is no limitation in the Children's Code providing that only children's courts may issue subpoenas to children. Therefore, if a witness fails to appear as ordered, the court with jurisdiction over the case may issue a bench warrant for that witness' arrest, whether or not that witness is a child. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-14.\n\nLegal proceedings to prevent withholding of medical treatment.— The state of New Mexico has authority under state law to pursue any legal remedies, including the authority to initiate legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction, as may be necessary to prevent the withholding of medically indicated treatment from disabled infants with life-threatening conditions. 1985 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 85-05.\n\nBeing found within county without more, held not to suffice.— Juveniles who are merely found within a county in which a particular juvenile (now children's) court has jurisdiction, but who are not otherwise within the provisions of the code, may not be held. For a child under 18 years of age to be within the provisions of the Juvenile Code (now Children's Code) so as to permit him to be taken into custody and lawfully held requires that the juvenile shall have fallen into one of the following situations: (1) violated a law of the state or ordinance or regulation of a political subdivision of the state; (2) has by habitual disobedience of parental or other authority become habitually disobedient, wayward or uncontrollable; (3) is habitually truant from home or school; and (4) habitually deports himself in a manner to injure or endanger the morals, health or welfare of himself or others. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-52 (rendered under prior law).\n\nJuvenile to be cited to children's court by police officer.— No town or city police officer may knowingly cite a juvenile offender into any court other than the juvenile (now children's) court; and if a juvenile is mistakenly cited into any other court, the case must be transferred to the juvenile (now children's) court. That court may, in its discretion, allow the juvenile to be treated as an adult, and taken before another court of competent jurisdiction, but all cases of traffic violations by juveniles must first be submitted to the juvenile (now children's) court, as that court has exclusive original jurisdiction. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-199.\n\nApprehension for violation of state law or prohibited habitual conduct.— Juvenile Code (now Children's Code) does not authorize the apprehension and holding of juveniles unless a state law is violated or the juvenile is charged with habitual conduct specifically prohibited. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-52 (rendered under prior law).\n\nAllegation of habitual conduct by officer.— It is a practical impossibility for an apprehending officer to truthfully allege habitual conduct in the case of a runaway, except, of course, where the juvenile's past record is, in fact, known and can be presented. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-52 (rendered under prior law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"The Freedom of the Press vs. The Confidentiality Provisions in the New Mexico Children's Code,\"see4 N.M.L.

Proceedings in the court under the provisions of the Children's Code shall begin in the county where the child resides, or in the case of an eligible adult pursuant to the Fostering Connections Act [Chapter 32A, Article 26 NMSA 1978], where the eligible adult resides. If delinquency is alleged, the proceeding may also be begun in the county where the act constituting the alleged delinquent act occurred or in the county in which the child is detained. Neglect, abuse, family in need of court-ordered services or mental health proceedings may also begin in the county where the child is present when the proceeding is commenced. A transfer may be made if the residence of the child or eligible adult changes or for other good cause.\n\nB. In neglect, abuse, family in need of court-ordered services or adoption proceedings for the placement of an Indian child, the court shall, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, transfer the proceeding to the jurisdiction of the Indian child's tribe upon the petition of the Indian child's parent, the Indian child's guardian or the Indian child's tribe. The transfer shall be barred if there is an objection to the transfer by a parent of the Indian child or the Indian child's tribe.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-1-9, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 18; 1999, ch. 196, § 1; 2005, ch. 189, § 5; 2020, ch. 52, § 1.\n\nThe 2020 amendment,effective May 20, 2020, revised certain venue and transfer of venue provisions for proceedings under the Fostering Connections Act; in Subsection A, after \"where the child resides\", added \"or in the case of an eligible adult pursuant to the Fostering Connections Act, where the eligible adult resides\", and added \"A transfer may be made if the residence of the child or eligible adult changes or for other good cause\"; deleted former Subsections B and C and redesignated former Subsection D as Subsection B; and deleted former Subsection D.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, changed \"custodian\" to \"guardian\" in Subsection D.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, inserted \"or after\" in the second sentence of Subsection C, in Subsection D, inserted \"Indian\" preceding \"child's parents\" in the first sentence, and \"Indian\" preceding \"child or\" in the third sentence.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-13 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nTransfer barred.— Where a transfer of jurisdiction to tribal court was raised for the first time on appeal, application of the statute was not allowed because the issue was not properly preserved.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Andrea M., 2000-NMCA-079, 129 N.M. 512, 10 P.3d 191.\n\nIntent of section.— The legislature intended to create a mechanism which would allow both the children's court and the district court to exercise full subject matter jurisdiction in criminal matters.State v. Garcia, 1979-NMSC-049, 93 N.M. 51, 596 P.2d 264.\n\nDistrict court was required to send matter to children's courtif defendant was not adult when the offense charged allegedly was committed.State v. Doe, 1980-NMCA-147, 95 N.M. 88, 619 P.2d 192.\n\nRemand from state district court to children's court.— On habeas corpus petitions by state prisoners, the federal courts are concerned only with basic constitutional questions, and whether a juvenile under New Mexico law is entitled to a remand from the state district court to the juvenile (now children's) court because of defects in the waiver of jurisdiction presents a procedural question ordinarily to be determined by the New Mexico courts.Salazar v. Rodriguez, 371 F.2d 726 (10th Cir. 1967).\n\nTraffic offenses not deemed delinquent acts.— Municipal and magistrate courts can exercise jurisdiction over children for traffic offenses which are not designated delinquent acts under the Children's Code. 1972 Op.

A court has reason to know that a child is an Indian child if:\n\n(1) an Indian tribe asserts that the child may be eligible for membership;\n\n(2) any party in the proceeding, officer of the court involved in the proceeding or an Indian organization informs the court that the child is an Indian child;\n\n(3) any party at the hearing, officer of the court present at the hearing, Indian tribe or Indian organization informs the court that information has been discovered indicating that the child is an Indian child;\n\n(4) the child indicates to the court that the child is an Indian child;\n\n(5) the court is informed that the domicile or residence of the child, the child's parent, the child's guardian or the child's Indian custodian is on a reservation or in an Alaska native village;\n\n(6) the court is informed that the child is or has been under the jurisdiction of a tribal court;\n\n(7) the court is informed that the child or the child's parent possesses an identification card or other record indicating membership in an Indian tribe;\n\n(8) testimony or documents presented to the court indicate that the child may be an Indian child; or\n\n(9) any other indicia provided to the court or within the court's knowledge indicate that the child is an Indian child.\n\nE. If a court has reason to know that a child is an Indian child but does not have sufficient evidence to determine whether the child is an Indian child, the court shall:\n\n(1) treat the child as an Indian child until the court determines, on the record, that the child is not an Indian child; and\n\n(2) require the department or another party to submit a report, declaration or testimony on the record that the department or other party made active efforts to identify and work with all of the Indian tribes of which there is reason to know the child may be a member or be eligible for membership to verify whether the child is an Indian child.\n\nF.

(now 10-211 NMRA), is that every child has the right to be represented by an attorney and that a child is not capable of making a knowing and intelligent waiver of that right.State v. Doe, 1980-NMCA-179, 95 N.M. 302, 621 P.2d 519.\n\nStatements made before advised by counsel inadmissible.— Where the statements of the defendant, a child, show he believed in the truth of statements witnesses made to the police, the defendant's statements were made to the police after the police took him into custody and at a time when he was not advised by counsel, and under this section the statements were inadmissible.State v.

Doe, 1979-NMCA-032, 93 N.M. 143, 597 P.2d 1183.\n\nChildren require opportunity to be heard.— Since the children's court made a dispositional ruling without giving the attorney for the children an opportunity to be heard, and since the attorney nevertheless sought to speak on behalf of the children, but the children's court interrupted and effectively denied the children the opportunity to be heard, the portions of the judgments committing each of the children to the department of corrections (now corrections department) were vacated to afford the children an opportunity to be heard before a new dispositional judgment is to be entered.State v. Doe, 1977-NMCA-050, 90 N.M. 404, 564 P.2d 207.\n\nA child has the right to address the children's court before disposition; the children's court should offer a child the opportunity to address the court before pronouncing sentence.State v.

Santiago Rene O., 1991-NMCA-139, 113 N.M. 148, 823 P.2d 948.\n\nNo reversal where court fails to advise of rights.— Although the court has a statutory obligation to advise children before it of their rights under the Children's Code and other laws at each separate appearance, that obligation must be read in light of the legislative purposes expressed in the code, and since the child did not claim any prejudice nor claim that he was not otherwise advised by his attorney of his constitutional or other legal rights, the appellate court would not reverse a commitment order for failure of the trial court to advise the child of his rights.In re Doe, 1975-NMCA-124, 88 N.M. 481, 542 P.2d 61.\n\nWaiver of right must be done intelligently.— Waiver of a right created by the constitution, a statute or a court-promulgated rule must be done intelligently and knowingly if the right is to be denied the one claiming it.State ex rel.

If the order appealed from grants the legal custody of the child to or withholds it from one or more of the parties to the appeal, the appeal shall be heard at the earliest practicable time.\n\nC. If the court of appeals does not dismiss the petition and order the child released, it shall affirm the court's judgment or it shall modify the court's judgment and remand the child to the jurisdiction of the court for disposition consistent with the appellate court's decision on the appeal.

Hovey, 1987-NMSC-080, 106 N.M. 300, 742 P.2d 512.\n\nIssue of parental rights to be raised by parent.— The state, prosecuting the probation revocation petition of a child in need of supervision, can appropriately challenge the custody arrangements made by the court, but since those custody arrangements and thus their effect on parental rights are of limited duration, the issue of parental rights is one to be raised by the parent and not by the state; a violation of due process can be urged only by those who can show an impairment of their rights in the application of the statute to them.In re Doe, 1975-NMCA-131, 88 N.M. 505, 542 P.2d 1195.\n\nCourt's discretion not to be disturbed absent showing of abuse.— Exercise of the court's discretion should not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a showing of manifest abuse.In re Doe, 1975-NMCA-131, 88 N.M. 505, 542 P.2d 1195.\n\nSupreme court review on appeal or writ of error.— A proceeding under act relating to dependent and neglected children was not a special proceeding, but was a civil action, and the judgment therein was reviewable in the supreme court on appeal or writ of error.Blanchard v. State ex rel. Wallace, 1925-NMSC-018, 30 N.M. 459, 238 P. 1004.\n\nTransfer order may be summarily affirmed.— Summary affirmance was due on order transferring a juvenile from children's court to be tried as an adult even though juvenile filed a timely memorandum in opposition to affirmance, and though continuing to contest summary disposition, he provided no reasons why the summary disposition should not be made.State v. Greg R., 1986-NMCA-096, 104 N.M. 778, 727 P.2d 86, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 761, 726 P.2d 1391.\n\nSupreme court without jurisdiction to review interlocutory order.— Where in an adoption proceeding based upon written consent of the parents to the adoption of their infant child, the trial court granted the parents' motion to withdraw their previous consent, and at the same time retained jurisdiction to declare the child found to be a dependent and neglected child, a ward of the court, and place it under the control and direction of New Mexico department of public welfare (now health care authority department), leaving temporary custody of the child with the adoptive parents pending further order of the court, the order was interlocutory in nature and the supreme court was without jurisdiction to review it.In re Adoption of Helms, 1955-NMSC-024, 59 N.M. 177, 281 P.2d 140.\n\nReview of best interests determination.— The best interests determination of the children's court attorney is subject to judicial review by the children's court and by the New Mexico court of appeals.State v.

Whenever legal custody of an adjudicated child is vested in someone other than the child's parents, including an agency, institution or department of this state, if the court, after notice to the parents or other persons legally obligated to support the child and after a hearing, finds that the parents or other legally obligated persons are financially able to pay all or part of the costs and expenses of the support and treatment, the court may order the parents or other legally obligated persons to pay to the custodian in the manner the court directs a reasonable sum that will cover all or part of the expenses of the support and treatment of the child subsequent to the entry of the custody order. The court may use the child support guidelines set forth in Section 40-4-11.1 NMSA 1978 to calculate a reasonable payment. If the parents or other legally obligated persons willfully fail or refuse to pay the sum ordered, the court may proceed with contempt charges and the order for payment may be filed and if filed shall have the effect of a civil judgment.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 32A-1-19, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 28; 2005, ch. 189, § 9; 2021, ch. 15, § 3.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective June 18, 2021, prohibited courts from requiring children subject to the provisions of the Delinquency Act, or their families, to pay court costs, certain expenses, fees or fines; and completely rewrote Subsection B.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, provided in Subsection A that the fees of a child's attorney shall be a charge upon the funds of the court.\n\nDecisions under prior law.— In light of the similarity of the provisions, annotations decided under former Section 32-1-41 NMSA 1978 have been included in the annotations to this section.\n\nAssessment of deposition costs.— The children's court cannot assess deposition costs against the human services department [health care authority department] in a child abuse and neglect proceeding.State ex rel.
