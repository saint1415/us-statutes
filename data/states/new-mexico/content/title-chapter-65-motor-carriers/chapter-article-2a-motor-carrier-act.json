The protesting carrier's proof should include, without limitation, a demonstration with reasonable specificity of the nature of the existing full service being provided, the volume of passengers transported, economic analysis related to expenses and revenues of the full-service operation and the anticipated economic, business or functional effect of the proposed service on the existing provision of, or rates for, full-service transportation within the full-service territory;\n\n(3) the department may allow other interested persons to intervene, either generally or on the basis of specific facts or issues.

In considering the potential effect on provision of transportation services to the public in regard to such an application, the department shall consider all evidence presented pertaining to such potential effect, including evidence of the effect that diversion of revenue or traffic may have on the provision of full-service passenger service to the community.

The plain language of § 65-2A-33(J) of the MCA demonstrates that the legislature intended to allow an authorized transportation service carrier to sue a transportation services carrier who operates without authorization.Albuquerque Cab Co., Inc. v.
