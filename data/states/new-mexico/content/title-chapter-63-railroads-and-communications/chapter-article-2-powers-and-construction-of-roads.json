To secure the payment of such bonds, notes or obligations or the bonds or obligations of any other corporation that may be issued in its interest, or for any of the above purposes or to raise funds therefor, it may mortgage or convey in trust its corporate property or any part thereof and the rights, privileges, powers and franchises in connection therewith or appurtenant thereto;\n\nO. to grant to any railroad corporation the right to use in common with it its railroad and telegraph lines or any part thereof.

The land required for such new line may be acquired by contract with the owners thereof or by condemnation, as provided by law, as in the case of the original line;\n\nR. to increase or diminish its capital stock if at any time it appears that the amount thereof, as fixed in its articles of incorporation, is either more or less than is actually required for constructing, equipping, operating and maintaining its road and telegraph lines. Such increase or decrease shall not be made except by a vote of stockholders representing at least two-thirds of the subscribed capital stock. A certified copy of the proceedings of the meeting and its action in the premises, under the seal of the corporation, shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state and be, by the secretary of state, attached to the articles of incorporation on file in the secretary of state's office; and\n\nS. to consolidate with one or more railroad corporations or under the laws of any other state or territory, its capital stock, properties, roads, equipments, adjuncts, franchises, claims, demands, contracts, agreements, obligations, debts, liabilities and assets of every kind and description upon such terms and in such manner as may be agreed upon by the respective boards of directors; provided no such consolidation shall take effect until it has been ratified and confirmed in writing by stockholders of the respective corporations representing three-fourths of the subscribed capital stock of their respective corporations. In case of such consolidation, articles of incorporation and consolidation shall be prepared setting forth:\n\n(1) the name of the new corporation;\n\n(2) the purpose for which it is formed;\n\n(3) the place where its principal business is to be transacted;\n\n(4) the term for which it is to exist, which shall not exceed fifty years;\n\n(5) the number of its directors, which shall not be less than five nor more than eleven, and the names and residences of the persons appointed to act as such until their successors are elected and qualified;\n\n(6) the amount of its capital stock, which shall not exceed the amount actually required for the purposes of the new corporation, as estimated by competent engineers, and the number of shares into which it is divided;\n\n(7) the amount of stock actually subscribed and by whom;\n\n(8) the termini of its road and branches;\n\n(9) the estimated length of its road and branches;\n\n(10) that at least ten percent of its subscribed capital stock has been paid in;\n\n(11) the names of the constituent corporations and the terms and conditions of consolidation in full. The articles of incorporation and consolidation shall be signed and countersigned by the presidents and secretaries of the several constituent corporations and sealed with their corporate seals. There shall be annexed thereto memoranda of the ratification and confirmation thereof by the stockholders of each constituent corporation, which must be respectively signed by stockholders representing at least three-fourths of the capital stock of their respective corporations. When completed, the articles shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state, and thereupon the constituent corporations named therein must be deemed and held to have become extinct in all courts and places and the new corporation shall be deemed and held in all courts and places to have succeeded to all their several capital stocks, properties, roads, equipments, adjuncts, franchises, claims, demands, contracts, agreements, assets, choses and rights in action, of every kind and description, both at law and in equity, and to be entitled to possess, enjoy and enforce the same and every thereof, as fully and completely as either and every of its constituents might have done had no consolidation taken place. The consolidated or new corporation shall also, in all courts and places, be deemed and held to have become subrogated to its several constituents and each thereof in respect to all their contracts and agreements with other parties and all their debts, obligations and liabilities of every kind and nature to any persons, corporations or bodies politic. The new corporation shall sue and be sued in its own name in any and every case in which any or either of its constituents might have sued or might have been sued, at law or in equity, had no such consolidation been made. Such consolidated or new corporation shall possess, enjoy and exercise all its franchises, properties, powers, privileges, abilities, rights and immunities under the provisions of this chapter, and shall conduct its business according to its provisions and be subject to all its pains and penalties. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to impair the obligation of any contract to which any of such constituents were parties at the date of consolidation. All such contracts may be enforced by action or suit, as the case may be, against the consolidated corporation and satisfaction obtained out of the property that, at the date of the consolidation, belonged to the constituent, that was a party to the contract in action or suit, as well as out of any other property belonging to the consolidated corporation; and\n\n(12) every railroad corporation, in addition to the foregoing, shall have such further powers as may be necessary or convenient to enable it to exercise and enjoy, fully and completely, all the powers granted by this chapter and, generally all such powers as are usually conferred upon, required and exercised by railroad corporations and, in the exercise of its powers and every thereof, shall have and enjoy all the rights, privileges, abilities and capacities that are enjoyed by natural persons.\n\nHistory:Laws 1878, ch. 1, ch.

Eastern Ry. of N.M., 1910-NMSC-051, 15 N.M. 591, 110 P. 852.\n\nAbutting property owner is entitled to compensation for damagesresulting from construction of railroad on a street.N.M. R.R. Co. v. Hendricks, 1892-NMSC-025, 6 N.M. 611, 30 P. 901.\n\nIn computing damages resulting to abutting property ownerfrom construction of a railroad on a street, the damages are determined by comparing the value of the property immediately before and after the construction of the road.N.M. R.R. Co. v. Hendricks, 1892-NMSC-025, 6 N.M. 611, 30 P. 901.\n\nRate-making power of state corporation commission (now public regulation commission) to control.— The power granted in Subsection K yields to the rate-making power of the state corporation commission (now public regulation commission).San Juan Coal & Coke Co. v. Santa Fe, S.J. & N. R.R., 1931-NMSC-039, 35 N.M. 512, 2 P.2d 305.\n\nNature of rates fixed below maximum.— In view of this section and N.M. Const., art. XI, intrastate freight rates specified in a regularly filed and published tariff schedule, if below the maximum fixed by the legislature, and remaining uncanceled, are legislature-made or commission-made rates, as distinguished from purely carrier-made rates.Kemp Lumber Co. v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry., 1932-NMSC-020, 36 N.M. 126, 9 P.2d 387 (decided under art. XI, N.M. constitution, now repealed and replaced).\n\nSufficiency of pleadings.— Averment by railroad in trespass action that it had \"adopted such location\" was sufficient against demurrer, without allegation that it was done by its board of directors.Arizona & Colo. R.R. Co. v. Denver & Rio Grande R.R. Co., 1906-NMSC-007, 13 N.M. 345, 84 P. 1018,aff'd, 233 U.S. 601, 34 S. Ct. 691, 58 L. Ed. 1111 (1914).\n\nGenerally, as to recovery where statute sets maximum rates.— A statute fixing maximum rates amounts to a declaration that rates below maximum are just and reasonable. For a shipper to recover damages for overcharges, it must establish that rates exceed the schedule.Kemp Lumber Co. v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry., 1932-NMSC-020, 36 N.M. 126, 9 P.2d 387.\n\nAm.

The 1915 Code compilers substituted \"which belonged to the territory of New Mexico\" for \"which now belong to this territory or may hereafter become the property of this territory,\" making this section applicable to former territorial lands, while 19-7-57 NMSA 1978 might be applicable only to other state lands. However, insofar as land granted to the territory by the federal government is concerned, the same opinion of the attorney general appears still applicable, since it holds that such lands cannot be given away but must be used for the purposes and in the manner provided by the acts of congress which made the donations.\n\nCross references.— For state and municipalities not to aid private enterprise,seeN.M.
