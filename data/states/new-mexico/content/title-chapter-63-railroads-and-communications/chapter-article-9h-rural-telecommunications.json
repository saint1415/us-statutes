      "text": "The legislature declares that it remains the policy of the state of New Mexico to maintain for rural customers availability of access to telecommunications services at affordable rates. Furthermore, it is the policy of this state to have comparable long distance service rates, as established by the commission, for comparable markets or market areas. To the extent that it is consistent with maintaining availability of access to service at affordable rates for rural customers, it is further the policy of this state to encourage competition and reduce regulation in the telecommunications industry, thereby allowing access by the public to resulting rapid advances in telecommunications technology. It is the purpose of the Rural Telecommunications Act of New Mexico to permit a regulatory framework that will allow an orderly transition for rural telephone carriers from a regulated telecommunications industry to a competitive market environment consistent with the federal act. Further, the legislature finds that as part of such regulatory framework, it is necessary to provide disparate regulatory treatment between rural telephone carriers and non-rural telephone carriers in order to assist with accomplishing the goals established by the above declared policies. Disparate regulatory treatment is particularly necessary for those citizens who reside in rural New Mexico, because those rural areas constitute the bulk of the surface area within the boundaries of the state. Disparate regulatory treatment for rural telephone carriers requires relaxed regulation for rural telephone carriers with the objective of reducing the cost of regulation as well as the regulatory burden, permitting pricing flexibility and expediting required rate approvals, all in a manner consistent with both the purpose of an orderly transition from regulation to a competitive market environment and the federal act.\n\nHistory:Laws 1999, ch. 295, § 2.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 1999, ch. 295, § 16 made the Rural Telecommunications Act of New Mexico effective July 1, 1999.",

      "text": "A. The commission shall implement and maintain a \"state rural universal service fund\" to maintain and support universal service that is provided by eligible telecommunications carriers, including commercial mobile radio services carriers, as are determined by the commission. As used in this section, \"universal service\" means basic local exchange service, comparable retail alternative services at affordable rates, service pursuant to a low-income telephone assistance plan and broadband internet access service to unserved and underserved areas as determined by the commission.\n\nB. The fund shall be financed by a surcharge on intrastate retail public telecommunications services to be determined by the commission, excluding services provided pursuant to a low-income telephone assistance plan billed to end-user customers by a telecommunications carrier, and excluding all amounts from surcharges, gross receipts taxes, excise taxes, franchise fees and similar charges. For the purpose of funding the fund, the commission has the authority to apply the surcharge on intrastate retail public telecommunications services provided by telecommunications carriers, including commercial mobile radio services and voice over internet protocol services, at a competitively and technologically neutral rate or rates to be determined by the commission. The commission may establish the surcharge as a percentage of intrastate retail public telecommunications services revenue or as a fixed amount applicable to each communication connection. For purposes of this section, a \"communication connection\" means a voice-enabled telephone access line, wireless voice connection, unique voice over internet protocol service connection or other uniquely identifiable functional equivalent as determined by the commission. Such surcharges shall be competitively and technologically neutral. Money deposited in the fund is not public money, and the administration of the fund is not subject to the provisions of law regulating public funds. The commission shall not apply this surcharge to a private telecommunications network; to the state, a county, a municipality or other governmental entity; to a public school district; to a public institution of higher education; to an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo; or to Native American customers who reside on tribal or pueblo land.\n\nC. The fund shall be competitively and technologically neutral, equitable and nondiscriminatory in its collection and distribution of funds, portable between eligible telecommunications carriers and additionally shall provide a specific, predictable and sufficient support mechanism as determined by the commission that ensures universal service in the state.\n\nD. The commission shall:\n\n(1) establish eligibility criteria for participation in the fund consistent with federal law that ensure the availability of universal service at affordable rates. The eligibility criteria shall not restrict or limit an eligible telecommunications carrier from receiving federal universal service support;\n\n(2) provide for the collection of the surcharge on a competitively neutral basis and for the administration and disbursement of money from the fund;\n\n(3) determine those services and areas requiring support from the fund;\n\n(4) provide for the separate administration and disbursement of federal universal service funds consistent with federal law; and\n\n(5) establish affordability benchmark rates for local residential and business services that shall be utilized in determining the level of support from the fund. The process for determining subsequent adjustments to the benchmark shall be established through a rulemaking.\n\nE. All incumbent telecommunications carriers and competitive carriers already designated as eligible telecommunications carriers for the fund shall be eligible for participation in the fund. All other carriers that choose to become eligible to receive support from the fund may petition the commission to be designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier for the fund. The commission may grant eligible carrier status to a competitive carrier in a rural area upon a finding that granting the application is in the public interest. In making a public interest finding, the commission may consider at least the following items:\n\n(1) the impact of designation of an additional eligible carrier on the size of the fund;\n\n(2) the unique advantages and disadvantages of the competitor's service offering; and\n\n(3) any commitments made regarding the quality of telephone service.\n\nF. The commission shall adopt rules, including a provision for variances, for the implementation and administration of the fund in accordance with the provisions of this section. The rules shall enumerate the appropriate uses of fund support and any restrictions on the use of fund support by eligible telecommunications carriers. The rules shall require that an eligible telecommunications carrier receiving support from the fund pursuant to Subsection K, L, M or N of this section must expend no less than sixty percent of the support it receives to deploy and maintain broadband internet access services in rural areas of the state. The rules also shall provide for annual reporting by eligible telecommunications carriers verifying that the reporting carrier continues to meet the requirements for designation as an eligible telecommunications carrier for purposes of the fund and is in compliance with the commission's rules, including the provisions regarding use of support from the fund.\n\nG. The commission shall, upon implementation of the fund, select a neutral third-party administrator to collect, administer and disburse money from the fund under the supervision and control of the commission pursuant to established criteria and rules promulgated by the commission. The administrator may be reasonably compensated for the specified services from the surcharge proceeds to be received by the fund pursuant to Subsection B of this section. For purposes of this subsection, the commission shall not be a neutral third-party administrator.\n\nH. The fund established by the commission shall ensure the availability of universal service as determined by the commission at affordable rates in rural areas of the state; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed as granting any authority to the commission to impose the surcharge on or otherwise regulate broadband internet access services.\n\nI. The commission shall ensure that intrastate switched access charges are equal to interstate switched access charges established by the federal communications commission as of January 1, 2006. Nothing in this section shall preclude the commission from considering further adjustments to intrastate switched access charges based on changes to interstate switched access charges.\n\nJ. To ensure that providers of intrastate retail communications service contribute to the fund and to further ensure that the surcharge determined pursuant to Subsection B of this section to be paid by the end-user customer will be held to a minimum, the commission shall adopt rules, or take other appropriate action, to require all such providers to participate in a plan to ensure accurate reporting.\n\nK. The commission shall authorize payments from the fund to incumbent local exchange carriers, in combination with revenue-neutral rate rebalancing up to the affordability benchmark rates. Beginning in 2018, the commission shall make access reduction support payments in the amount made from the fund in base year 2014, adjusted each year thereafter by:\n\n(1) the annual percentage change in the number of access lines served by the incumbent local exchange carriers receiving such support for the prior calendar year, as compared to base year 2014; and\n\n(2) changes in the affordability benchmark rates that have occurred since 2014.\n\nL. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection K of this section, the annual amount of access reduction support payments for an eligible incumbent local exchange carrier in 2024, 2025 and 2026 shall be equal to the annual access reduction support payments for that eligible incumbent local exchange carrier for the year 2023. Access reduction support payments shall be terminated after December 31, 2026.\n\nM. The commission shall determine the methodology to be used to authorize payments to all other carriers that apply for and receive eligible carrier status; provided that:\n\n(1) an eligible incumbent telecommunications carrier that is not eligible for funding pursuant to rate rebalancing in Subsection K of this section and that has been previously authorized pursuant to Subsection N of this section for need-based support may apply for ongoing fund support;\n\n(2) the commission shall award an applicant ongoing fund support at no less than the average access line amount of funding support for comparable carriers; provided that an eligible telecommunications carrier receiving fund support pursuant to this subsection shall not offer basic local exchange residential and business services at rate levels lower than the rates for such services charged by any of the comparable carriers used for the determination of the level of support;\n\n(3) the commission shall act upon a request for ongoing fund support within one hundred twenty days of the filing of the request; and\n\n(4) nothing in this section shall limit the commission's authority to adopt rules pursuant to Subsection F of this section regarding appropriate uses of fund support and any restrictions on the use of the fund support by eligible telecommunications carriers.\n\nN. The commission may also authorize payments from the fund to incumbent rural telecommunications carriers or to telecommunications carriers providing comparable retail alternative services that have been designated as eligible telecommunications carriers serving in rural areas of the state upon a finding, based on factors that may include a carrier's regulated revenues, expenses or investment, by the commission that such payments are needed to ensure the widespread availability and affordability of universal service. The commission shall decide cases filed pursuant to this subsection with reasonable promptness, with or without a hearing, but no later than six months following the filing of an application seeking payments from the fund, unless the commission finds that a longer time will be required, in which case the commission may extend the period for an additional three months.\n\nO. The commission shall adopt rules that establish and implement a broadband program to provide funding to eligible telecommunications carriers for the construction and maintenance of broadband infrastructure. Each year, an amount equal to thirty million dollars ($30,000,000) less the amounts expended pursuant to Subsections K, L, M and N of this section shall be dedicated to the broadband program.\n\nP. Rules adopted pursuant to Subsection O of this section shall require that the commission:\n\n(1) consider applications for funding on a technology-neutral basis;\n\n(2) submit applications for funding to the connect New Mexico council for prioritization and alignment with the statewide broadband plan to ensure digital equity and digital inclusion; and\n\n(3) require that the awards of support be consistent with federal universal service support programs.\n\nQ. The total obligations of the fund determined by the commission pursuant to this section, plus administrative expenses and a prudent fund balance, shall not exceed a cap of thirty million dollars ($30,000,000) per year. The commission shall evaluate the amount of the cap in an appropriate proceeding to be completed by June 30, 2019 and consider whether, based on the then-current status of the fund, the cap should be modified, maintained or eliminated.\n\nR. By October 1 of each year, the commission shall make a report to the legislature regarding the status of the fund, including:\n\n(1) relevant data relating to implementation of the broadband program and the progress toward digital equity and digital inclusion in rural areas of the state;\n\n(2) recommendations for changes to the structure, size and purposes of the fund and whether the cap on the fund provided for in Subsection Q of this section should be modified, maintained or eliminated; and\n\n(3) the service areas that received funding awards from the broadband program and the amounts of those awards.\n\nS.

Under 63-9H-11 NMSA 1978, a PRC order must be upheld if the order substantially complies with the Rural Telecommunications Act of New Mexico, 63-9H-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.N.M. Exch. Carrier Grp. v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2016-NMSC-015.\n\nWhere the public regulation commission's (PRC) surcharge rate order, adopting a three percent consumer surcharge rate to be collected and placed in the state rural universal telephone communication services fund, would have resulted in a projected fund deficit, the order was arbitrary, not supported by substantial evidence, and in violation of the PRC's own rules which required that the surcharge be large enough to allow for a prudent fund balance.N.M. Exch. Carrier Grp. v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2016-NMSC-015.\n\nWhere the public regulation commission adopted a rule order which amended 2005 rules which set forth the procedures for administering and implementing the state rural universal service fund, there was not substantial evidence in the record to support a finding that the newly adopted funding formula was adequate to satisfy the requirements of 63-9H-6(C) and (K) NMSA 1978, that the surcharge be large enough to allow for a prudent fund balance.N.M. Exch. Carrier Grp. v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2016-NMSC-015.\n\nCommission's order permanently barring carrier from ever filing a petition in the future was beyond the scope of the commission's authority.— Where appellant petitioned the New Mexico public regulation commission (commission) for designation as an eligible telecommunications carrier (ETC) to receive low-income federal universal service support funds pursuant to the federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, and where the hearing examiner recommended that the petition be dismissed with prejudice and that appellant be banned from ever again filing a petition to obtain an ETC designation, the commission erred in adopting the hearing examiner's recommendation, because while the hearing examiner may recommend dismissal of a proceeding, and the commission has the power to dismiss a proceeding on its own motion, the commission lacks express or implied statutory authority to dismiss an ETC designation with prejudice to permanently bar a carrier from ever again seeking an ETC designation.Q Link Wireless LLC v.

Rates for retail rural public telecommunications services provided by an incumbent rural telecommunications carrier shall be subject to regulation by the commission only in the manner and to the extent authorized by this section.\n\nB. An incumbent rural telecommunications carrier shall file tariffs for all retail public telecommunications services that, other than residential local exchange service, shall be effective after ten days' notice to its customers and the commission. An incumbent rural telecommunications carrier shall remain subject to complaint by an interested party subject to Section 63-9H-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. An incumbent rural telecommunications carrier may increase its rates for residential local exchange service in the manner provided in Subsection B of this section to comply with requirements imposed by any federal or state law or rule. The procedures of Subsections D, E and F of this section shall not apply to increases under this subsection.\n\nD. Except as provided in Subsection C of this section, rates for residential local exchange service may be increased by an incumbent rural telecommunications carrier only after sixty days' notice to all affected subscribers. The notice of increase shall include:\n\n(1) the reasons for the rate increase;\n\n(2) a description of the affected service;\n\n(3) an explanation of the right of the subscriber to petition the commission for a public hearing on the rate increase;\n\n(4) a list of local exchange areas that are affected by the proposed rate increase; and\n\n(5) the dates, times and places for the public informational meetings required by this section.\n\nE. An incumbent rural telecommunications carrier that proposes to increase its rates for residential local exchange service pursuant to Subsection D of this section shall hold at least one public informational meeting in each public regulation commissioner's district as established by the Public Regulation Commission Apportionment Act [Chapter 8, Article 7 NMSA 1978] in which there is a local exchange area affected by the rate change.\n\nF. Residential local exchange service rates increased by an incumbent rural telecommunications carrier pursuant to Subsections D and E of this section shall be reviewed by the commission only upon written protest signed by two and one-half percent of all affected subscribers or upon the commission staff's own motion for good cause. The protest shall specifically set forth the particular rate or charge as to which review is requested, the reasons for the requested review and the relief that the persons protesting desire. If a proper protest is presented to the commission within sixty days from the date notice of the rate change was sent to affected subscribers of an incumbent rural telecommunications carrier, the commission may accept and file the complaint and, upon proper notice, may suspend the rates at issue during the pendency of the proceedings and reinstate the rates previously in effect and shall hold and complete a hearing thereon within ninety days after filing to determine if the rates as proposed are fair, just and reasonable. The commission may, within sixty days after close of the hearing, enter an order adjusting the rates at issue, except that the commission shall not set any rate below the intrastate cost of providing the service, which shall include the cost methodology and rate of return authorized by the federal communications commission. In the order, the commission may order a refund of amounts collected in excess of the rates and charges as approved at the hearing, which may be paid as a credit against billings for future services. If the complaint is denied, the commission shall enter an order denying the complaint within sixty days after the close of the hearing, and the rates shall be deemed approved. For purposes of this section, cost shall also include a reasonable amount of joint and common costs incurred by the telecommunications carrier in its operations and may include other accounting adjustments authorized by the commission.\n\nG. An incumbent rural telecommunications carrier may at any time elect to file an application with the commission requesting the commission to prescribe fair, just and reasonable rates for the carrier, based on the carrier's revenue, expenses and investment in accordance with traditional rate-making principles factors that may include the carrier's revenues, expenses or investment, in a manner consistent with the policy calling for relaxed regulation of incumbent rural telecommunications carriers expressed in Section 63-9H-2 NMSA 1978 and Subsection C of Section 63-9H-4 NMSA 1978. The commission shall decide cases filed under this subsection with reasonable promptness but no later than nine months following the filing of an application, unless the commission finds that a longer time will be required, in which case the commission may extend the period for an additional three months.\n\nH. Rates for local exchange, vertical and long distance service to retail end-user customers may be reduced to a level equal to, but not below, the intrastate cost, which shall include the cost methodology and rate of return authorized by the federal communications commission. If an incumbent rural telecommunications carrier loses its exemption pursuant to Section 251 of the federal act, the rate for a service, excluding basic service, must cover the cost of the service, including the imputed rate of wholesale service elements as may be required by the commission. The cost of long distance service must also include any interexchange access rates charged to another telecommunications carrier for the service.\n\nI. An incumbent rural telecommunications carrier operating pursuant to this section shall have the ability to offer or discontinue offering special incentives, discounts, packaged offerings, temporary rate waivers or other promotions, or to offer individual contracts.\n\nHistory:Laws 1999, ch. 295, § 7; 2005, ch. 335, § 2; 2013, ch. 194, § 5.\n\nCross references.— For the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996,seeTitles 15, 18, and 47 of the United States Code.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective June 14, 2013, provided for rate increases and for the determination of fair, just and reasonable rates; in Subsection B, in the first sentence, after \"ten days' notice to\", added \"its customers and\" and after \"the commission\", deleted \"and publication in a local newspaper in the incumbent service area\"; added Subsection C; in Subsection D, in the first sentence of the introductory paragraph, added \"Except as provided in Subsection C of this section\"; deleted former Subsection D, which provided for rate increases by incumbent rural telecommunications carriers for residential local exchange service; in Subsection E, after \"local exchange service\", added \"pursuant to Subsection D of this section\"; in Subsection F, in the first sentence, after \"carrier pursuant to\", changed \"Subsection D\" to \"Subsections D and E\"; and in Subsection G, in the first sentence, after \"telecommunications carrier\", deleted \"that serves less than five percent of the state's aggregate statewide subscriber lines\" and after \"for the carrier based on\", deleted \"the carrier's revenue, expense and investment in accordance with traditional rate-making principles\" and added the reminder of the sentence, and added the second sentence.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, deleted the former provision of Subsection E, which provided that if the commission adjusted rates after a hearing, the rate shall not be set below the intrastate cost of service that will include the cost and rate of return pursuant to Section 63-9H-6D NMSA 1978; provided in Subsection E that if the commission adjusts rates after a hearing, the rate shall not be set below the intrastate cost of service which shall include the cost methodology and rate of return authorized by the federal communications commission; deleted the former provision of Subsection G, which provided that rates may not be reduced below the intrastate cost which shall include the cost and rate of return pursuant to Section 63-9H-6D NMSA 1978 and provided in Subsection E that rates shall not be reduced below the intrastate cost which shall include the cost methodology and rate of return authorized by the federal communications commission.",
