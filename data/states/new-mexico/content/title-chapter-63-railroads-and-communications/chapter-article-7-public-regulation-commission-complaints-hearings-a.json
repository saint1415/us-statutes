      "heading": "Public regulation commission; term defined; office",
      "text": "The term \"commission\", as used in Chapter 63, Article 7 NMSA 1978, means the public regulation commission. The office of the commission shall be located in the city of Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nHistory:Laws 1912, ch. 78, § 1; Code 1915, § 5373; C.S. 1929, § 134-1106; 1941 Comp., § 74-701; 1953 Comp., § 69-7-1; Laws 1998, ch. 108, § 50; 2001, ch. 245, § 2.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Chapter 63, Article 7, 63-7-1 to 63-7-23 NMSA 1978, would have been repealed by Laws 1998, ch. 108, § 82, effective July 1, 2003. However, Laws 2003, ch. 23, § 1 and Laws 2003, ch. 416, § 5 repealed Laws 1998, ch. 108, § 82 before the repeal took effect.\n\nCross references.— For creation of commission,seeN.M. Const., art. XI, § 1.\n\nFor duties of commission,seeN.M. Const., art. XI, § 2.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, substituted \"term defined; office\" for \"terms defined; office organization\" in the section heading; and rewrote the first sentence, which formerly read \"The terms 'commission' and 'clerk' or 'chief clerk' where used in this article shall mean, respectively, the public regulation commission and the chief clerk of the commission.\"\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective January 1, 1999, amended this section to change \"state corporation commission\" to \"public regulation commission\" to reflect the January 1, 1999 repeal of former Article XI, § 1 of the New Mexico Constitution.\n\nGenerally, as to power to fix rates.— The power to fix rates is an attribute of sovereignty, legislative in its nature and delegated by the constitution to the corporation commission (now public regulation commission) which was intended to have all the power to fix rates, and the legislature to have none of it.Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. N.M. SCC, 1977-NMSC-032, 90 N.M. 325, 563 P.2d 588.\n\nNo power to make rates retroactive.— Neither the applicable constitutional provisions nor the pertinent statutes provide the commission with permission to make rates retroactive.Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. N.M. SCC, 1977-NMSC-032, 90 N.M. 325, 563 P.2d 588.\n\nEconomic scheme as a whole to be looked at.— The commission has a constitutional mandate to consider a telephone company's earnings, investments and expenditures as a whole within the state in promulgating rates; it is not confined solely to the cost-of-service formula.Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. N.M. SCC, 1977-NMSC-032, 90 N.M. 325, 563 P.2d 588.\n\nValue of service may be looked at.— Under some circumstances the value of telephone service may be entitled to more weight than an estimate of cost of service, which necessarily involves many allocations on a more or less arbitrary basis.Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. N.M. SCC, 1977-NMSC-032, 90 N.M. 325, 563 P.2d 588.\n\nLatest available economic information should be utilizedby the commission in order to insure that projected figures bear a meaningful relation to future as well as past and present fiscal realities.Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. N.M. SCC, 1977-NMSC-032, 90 N.M. 325, 563 P.2d 588.\n\nDetermining level of subsidies to telephone users is commission function.Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. N.M. SCC, 1977-NMSC-032, 90 N.M. 325, 563 P.2d 588.\n\nRate-making power of commission is plenary,except as restricted by those principles of constitutional law which would have limited its exercise if it had been intrusted to the legislature.Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. N.M. SCC, 1977-NMSC-032, 90 N.M. 325, 563 P.2d 588.\n\nBond requirement.— Where the supreme court's order prior to review fixed interim telephone rates to be in force under bond for one year, and after review the court found substantial evidence in the record to show that these rates were just and reasonable, it held that there was no necessity that a bond be provided.Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. N.M. SCC, 1977-NMSC-032, 90 N.M. 325, 563 P.2d 588.\n\nGiven by implication of law.— The authority to grant rates under bond, as a lawful and necessary adjunct to the effectual exercise of the power to fix interim rates, is given by implication of law.Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. N.M. SCC, 1977-NMSC-032, 90 N.M. 325, 563 P.2d 588.\n\nGenerally, as to duty to formulate rates.— It is inherent in the commission's constitutional mandate that it has the authority to refuse to fix telephone rates when it does not have substantial evidence from which fair rates can be reasonably calculated or determined. Under such circumstances the commission has a duty to deny the rates, and thus it cannot be said that under all situations, without regard for the state of the evidence, the commission has a duty to formulate rates.Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. N.M. SCC, 1977-NMSC-032, 90 N.M. 325, 563 P.2d 588.\n\nDuty affirmative, not passive.— The commission has an ongoing, affirmative duty to establish rules and regulations, issue orders, examine records, conduct investigations, grant continuances and do all other things necessary to insure that the public has fair telephone rates and that the utility is fairly treated; its role is not a passive one.Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. N.M. SCC, 1977-NMSC-032, 90 N.M. 325, 563 P.2d 588.\n\nWhere constitutional duty to fix interim rates.— The commission, when it had found that the rates of the telephone company were not fair and reasonable and when it became obvious that it would be a considerable length of time before permanent rates could be fixed, had a constitutional duty to fix interim rates that would minimize the confiscation of the company's property, and failure to increase the rates was an unconstitutional confiscation of the company's property without due process of law.Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. N.M. SCC, 1977-NMSC-032, 90 N.M. 325, 563 P.2d 588.\n\nPublic policy enters into the apportionment of rates,and it is incumbent upon the commission to make public policy decisions and to change proposed rates that do not comport therewith.Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. N.M. SCC, 1977-NMSC-032, 90 N.M. 325, 563 P.2d 588.\n\nGenerally, as to construction and maintenance of railroad crossing.— The state corporation commission (now public regulation commission) has the power to require a railway company to construct and maintain a crossing at grade whenever it finds that the company's tracks are intersected by any kind of way open to the public as a matter of right for vehicular travel. The commission's power includes the power to require the company to do anything which will make the crossing \"good and sufficient,\" that is, safe and convenient for public use. The commission can order the railroad company to construct and maintain a crossing at grade at its own expense, except when the state highway department (now department of transportation) is involved in the construction or reconstruction of the crossing. When the state highway department (now department of transportation) is involved, it will pay the costs of making the crossing's surface level with the rails. The railroad must bear the remaining construction costs as well as all maintenance costs. 1974 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 74-07.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 13 Am.

      "text": "A. With respect to transmission companies, the commission shall:\n\n(1) fix, determine, supervise, regulate and control all charges and rates of telegraph, telephone and other transmission companies within the state;\n\n(2) determine any matters of public convenience and necessity with respect to matters subject to its regulatory authority as provided by law;\n\n(3) change, amend and rescind rates;\n\n(4) enforce its rules through administrative sanctions and in the courts; and\n\n(5) carry out all other duties and have all other powers provided by law.\n\nB. In fixing rates of telephone and telegraph companies, due consideration shall be given to the earnings, investments and expenditures as a whole within the state. The commission shall include in that consideration the earnings, investments and expenditures derived from or related to the sale of directory advertising and other directory listing services.\n\nC. The commission may subpoena witnesses and documents, enforce its subpoenas through any court and, through the court, punish for contempt.\n\nD. The commission has the power, after notice and hearing of record, to determine and decide any question and to issue orders relating to its powers and duties.\n\nE. An interested party may appeal from a final order of the commission by filing a notice of appeal with the supreme court asking for review of the order within thirty days of the final order. The appellant shall pay to the commission any costs of preparing and transmitting the record to the court.\n\nF. The pendency of an appeal shall not automatically stay the order appealed from. The appellant may seek to obtain a stay from the commission or the supreme court.\n\nG. The appeal shall be on the record of the hearing before the commission and shall be governed by the appellate rules applicable to administrative appeals. The supreme court shall affirm the commission's order unless it is:\n\n(1) arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion;\n\n(2) not supported by substantial evidence in the record; or\n\n(3) otherwise not in accordance with law.\n\nH. In the case of a failure or refusal of any person to comply with an order of the commission within the time prescribed in the order or within thirty days after the order is entered, whichever is later, unless a stay has been granted, the commission shall seek enforcement of the order in the district court. The enforcement hearing shall be held on an expedited basis. At the hearing, the sole question shall be whether the person has failed to comply with or violated the order.\n\nHistory:Laws 1998, ch. 108, § 52; 2023, ch. 100, § 21.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective July 1, 2024, removed duties and responsibilities from the public regulation commission due to the transfer of certain duties and responsibilities to the department of transportation; in the section heading, deleted \"transportation and\", and after \"companies\", deleted \"and common carriers\"; and in Subsection A, in the introductory clause, after \"respect to\", deleted \"transportation and\", and after \"companies\", deleted \"and common carriers\", in Paragraph A(1), after \"rates of\", deleted \"railway, express\", after \"telephone\", deleted \"sleeping car and other transportation\", and after \"companies\", deleted \"and common carriers\", deleted former Paragraphs A(3) and A(4) and redesignated former Paragraphs A(5) through A(7) as Paragraphs A(3) through A(5), respectively.\n\nAdoption of conclusions from a previous proceeding denied due process.— Where the PRC entered an order in a case that determined the price floor for promotional offerings by the utility intervenor; in a second case, the PRC incorporated findings from the first case into the order entered in the second case; the findings were based on evidence in the first case, and appellant was a party to the second case but not to the first case, appellant's due process rights were violated because appellant was denied the opportunity to present evidence and to examine and cross-examine witnesses regarding the PRC's decision in the first case.TW Telecom of N.M., LLC v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2011-NMSC-029, 150 N.M. 12, 256 P.3d 24.\n\nAppeals from final orders.— The public regulation commission (PRC) was not authorized to issue orders of removal under the former provisions of N.M. Const., art. XI, § 7 that were repealed effective January 1, 1999; instead, Section 8-8-21 NMSA 1978 authorized the parties to treat final orders of the state corporation commission that were not removed to the supreme court prior to that date as final orders of the PRC for purposes of appeal under this section.U.S. W. Commc'ns, Inc. v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 1999-NMSC-024, 127 N.M. 375, 981 P.2d 789.\n\nImputation of telephone directory revenue to set telephone rates.— New Mexico's imputation of the telephone directory revenue of plaintiff's subsidiary to plaintiff's telephone services for telephone rate setting purposes did not interfere with interstate commerce and plaintiff's challenge to the imputation was a challenge to an order affecting rates that was barred under the Johnson Act, 28 U.S.C. §1342.U.S. West Inc. v. Tristani, 182 F.3d 1202 (10th Cir. 1999).",

The commission may impose an administrative fine on a telecommunications provider for any act or omission that the provider knew or should have known was a violation of any applicable law or rule or order of the commission.\n\nC. Except in the case of disputes between telecommunications providers, an administrative fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) may be imposed for each violation or each of multiple violations arising out of the same facts up to a maximum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000); or an administrative fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) may be imposed for each day of a continuing violation arising out of the same facts up to a maximum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the commission may impose an administrative fine not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) for a single violation:\n\n(1) that results in substantial harm to the customers of the telecommunications provider or substantial harm to the public interest; or\n\n(2) for failure to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity required by law or for operation outside the scope of that certificate.\n\nD.

The commission may initiate a proceeding to impose an administrative fine within two years from the date of the commission's discovery of the violation, but in no event shall a proceeding be initiated more than five years after the date of the violation. This limitation shall not run against any act or omission constituting a violation under this section for any period during which the telecommunications provider has fraudulently concealed the violation.\n\nH. The commission shall consider mitigating and aggravating circumstances in determining the amount of administrative fine imposed.\n\nI. For purposes of establishing a violation, the act or omission of any officer, agent or employee of a telecommunications provider, within the scope of such person's authority, duties or employment, shall be deemed the act or omission of the telecommunications provider.\n\nJ. Any telecommunications provider or other person aggrieved by an order assessing an administrative fine may appeal the order to the supreme court of New Mexico.
