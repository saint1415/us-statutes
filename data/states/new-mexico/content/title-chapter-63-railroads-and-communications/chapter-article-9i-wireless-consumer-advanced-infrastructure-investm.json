An authority shall not enter into an exclusive agreement with a wireless provider for the use of a right of way in:\n\n(1) constructing, installing, maintaining, modifying, operating or replacing a utility pole; or\n\n(2) collocating a small wireless facility on a utility pole or wireless support structure.\n\nC. An authority may charge a wireless provider a rate or fee for the provider's use of a right of way in constructing, installing, maintaining, modifying, operating or replacing a utility pole, or in collocating a small wireless facility, in the right of way only if:\n\n(1) the authority otherwise may, under law, charge the rate or fee;\n\n(2) the authority charges other communications service providers for their use, if any, of the right of way; and\n\n(3) the rate or fee:\n\n(a) is competitively neutral as compared to other users, if any, of the right of way, unless the other users are exempt under law from paying a rate or fee for their use of the right of way;\n\n(b) is not in the form of a franchise or other fee based on revenue or customer counts;\n\n(c) is reasonable and nondiscriminatory; and\n\n(d) annually, does not exceed an amount equal to two hundred fifty dollars ($250) multiplied by the number of small wireless facilities placed by the wireless provider in the right of way and in the authority's jurisdiction.\n\nD. An authority may adjust the rate it charges for the use of a right of way, but no more often than once a year and by no more than an amount equal to one-half the annual change, if any, in the most recent consumer price index for all urban consumers for New Mexico, as published by the United States department of labor. An authority that adjusts that rate shall notify all wireless providers charged the pre-adjusted rate of the prospective adjustment and shall make the adjustment effective sixty days or more following that notice.\n\nE. Except as otherwise provided in the Wireless Consumer Advanced Infrastructure Investment Act, and subject to the approval of an application as provided in Section 4 of that act [63-9I-4 NMSA 1978], a wireless provider may collocate small wireless facilities and construct, install, modify, mount, maintain, operate and replace utility poles associated with the collocation of a small wireless facility along, across, on or under the right of way.\n\nF. If a wireless provider or the provider's contractor causes damage to the authority's property or right of way while the provider or contractor occupies, installs, repairs or maintains a small wireless facility, wireless support structure or utility pole in the right of way, the authority may require the provider to return the property to its pre-damage condition according to the authority's requirements and specifications if the requirements and specifications are competitively neutral and reasonable and upon written notice of the requirement to the provider. If the provider does not, within a reasonable period after receiving the notice, repair the property as required by the authority, the authority may make the repairs and charge the provider the reasonable, documented cost of the repairs.\n\nG. A wireless provider that deploys a utility pole or small wireless facility in a right of way shall construct, maintain and locate it so as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel on, or endanger the public in, the right of way, damage or interfere with another utility facility in the right of way or interfere with another utility's use of its facility in the right of way. In constructing and maintaining its utility pole or small wireless facility, the wireless provider shall comply with the national electrical safety code and all applicable laws for the protection of underground and overhead utility facilities. An authority shall treat a wireless provider's utility poles and small wireless facilities in a right of way as it does the facilities, if any, of other utilities in the right of way; however, the authority may adopt reasonable regulations concerning the separation of the wireless provider's utility poles and small wireless facilities from other utility facilities in the right of way to prevent damage to, or interference with, the facilities or to prevent interference with a utility's use of its facility or facilities in, or to be placed in, the right of way.\n\nH. Subject to Subsection E of Section 4 of the Wireless Consumer Advanced Infrastructure Investment Act, an authority may require, as they pertain to small wireless facilities located in design districts or historic districts, reasonable, technically feasible, non-discriminatory and technologically neutral design or concealment measures and reasonable measures for conforming to the design aesthetics of design districts or historic districts, as long as the measures do not have the effect of prohibiting a wireless provider's technology. As used in this subsection:\n\n(1) \"design district\" means an area zoned or otherwise designated by municipal ordinance and for which a municipality maintains and uniformly enforces unique design and aesthetic standards; and\n\n(2) \"historic district\" means a group of buildings, properties or sites that fall within the category defined in 47 C.F.R. 1.1307(a)(4) and are:\n\n(a) listed in the national register of historic places or formally determined eligible for listing in that register by the keeper of the register in accordance with the nationwide programmatic agreement found in 47 C.F.R. Part 1, Appendix C; or\n\n(b) designated as a historic district in accordance with the Historic District and Landmark Act [Chapter 3, Article 22 NMSA 1978].\n\nI. Without the authority's discretionary and written consent, which the authority shall give in a nondiscriminatory way, a wireless provider shall not install a new utility pole in a right of way adjacent to a street or thoroughfare that is:\n\n(1) fifty feet wide or less; and\n\n(2) adjacent to single-family residential lots or other multifamily residences or to undeveloped land designated for residential use by zoning or deed restrictions.\n\nJ. A wireless provider that installs a new utility pole or small wireless facility in a right of way as described in Subsection H of this section shall comply with applicable private deed restrictions and other private restrictions affecting the area.\n\nK. A wireless provider shall notify an authority in writing of its intention to discontinue its use of a small wireless facility or utility pole. The notice shall inform the authority of the time and the way in which the wireless provider intends to remove the small wireless facility or utility pole. The wireless provider is responsible for the costs of the removal. The authority may require the wireless provider to return the property to its pre-installation condition according to the authority's reasonable and nondiscriminatory requirements and specifications. If the wireless provider does not complete the removal within forty-five days after the notice, the authority may complete the removal and assess the costs of removal against the wireless provider. The permit for the small wireless facility or utility pole expires upon removal.\n\nHistory:Laws 2018, ch. 17, § 3 and Laws 2018, ch. 69, § 3.\n\nDuplicate laws.— Laws 2018, ch. 17, § 3 and Laws 2018, ch. 69, § 3, both effective September 1, 2018, enacted identical new sections.

An authority may prohibit, regulate or charge for the collocation of a small wireless facility only as provided in this section and Sections 3 [63-9I-3 NMSA 1978], 6 [63-9I-6 NMSA 1978] and 7 [63-9I-7 NMSA 1978] of the Wireless Consumer Advanced Infrastructure Investment Act.\n\nC. A small wireless facility collocated on a utility pole or wireless support structure that extends ten or fewer feet above the pole or structure in a right of way in any zone is classified as a permitted use and is not subject to zoning review or approval.\n\nD. An authority may require an applicant to obtain one or more permits to collocate a small wireless facility in a right of way if the requirement is of general applicability to users of the right of way. An applicant seeking to collocate, within an authority's jurisdiction, up to twenty-five small wireless facilities, all of which are substantially the same type, on substantially the same types of structures may file a consolidated application for the collocation of the facilities. An applicant shall not file with an authority more than one consolidated application in any five-business-day period. The applicant shall include in a consolidated application an attestation that, unless a delay in collocation is caused by the lack of commercial power or fiber at the site, the collocation will begin within one hundred eighty days after the permit issuance date. The authority and the provider may subsequently agree to extend that period.\n\nE. An authority shall:\n\n(1) without bias, accept and process applications and issue permits to collocate small wireless facilities;\n\n(2) within thirty days after receiving an application, determine and notify the applicant of whether the application is complete and:\n\n(a) for an incomplete application, specifically identify the information missing from it; and\n\n(b) deem the application complete if the applicant is not notified within the thirty-day period;\n\n(3) within ninety days after receiving a completed application, approve or deny it and deem the application approved if that approval or denial is not given within the ninety-day period. The authority may request an extension of the ninety-day period, and the authority and applicant may agree to extend that period. An applicant shall not unreasonably deny an authority's request to extend the period;\n\n(4) approve a completed application unless the application does not conform with:\n\n(a) applicable codes or local laws concerning: 1) public safety; 2) design for utility poles, but only to the extent that the standards the codes or laws impose are objective; 3) stealth and concealment, but only to the extent that the restrictions the codes or laws impose are reasonable; and 4) the spacing of ground-mounted equipment in a right of way; and\n\n(b) requirements imposed by the authority in accordance with Subsection H of Section 3 of the Wireless Consumer Advanced Infrastructure Investment Act; and\n\n(5) if it denies an application, document the basis for the denial, including the specific code or law on which the denial was based, and send that documentation to the applicant on or before the date the application is denied.\n\nF. In the ninety-day period after an authority receives an application to collocate a small wireless facility, the authority may:\n\n(1) provide public notice of the application and an opportunity for written public comment on the application; and\n\n(2) submit the written public comment to the applicant and request that the applicant respond to it.\n\nG. If an authority determines that applicable codes or laws require that a utility pole or wireless support structure be replaced before an application for collocation is approved, the authority may condition approval of the application on that replacement. That replacement is subject to Section 3 of the Wireless Consumer Advanced Infrastructure Investment Act.\n\nH. An applicant whose application is denied may cure the deficiencies identified by the authority and submit a revised application within thirty days after the denial for no additional fee. The authority shall base its review of the revised application only on the deficiencies cited in the denial and shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty days after receiving it.\n\nI. If an application is for the collocation of multiple small wireless facilities, the authority may:\n\n(1) treat as separate those for which incomplete information has been provided, that do not qualify for consolidated treatment or that are denied; and\n\n(2) issue separate permits for the collocations that it approves.\n\nJ. An authority shall not:\n\n(1) directly or indirectly require an applicant to perform services unrelated to the collocation for which approval is sought, such as the making of in-kind contributions to the authority of reserving fiber, conduit or pole space on the wireless provider's utility pole;\n\n(2) require an applicant to provide more information to obtain a permit than the authority requires of a communications service provider that is not a wireless provider and that requests a permit to attach facilities to a structure; however, the authority may require the applicant to certify that the small wireless facilities to be collocated conform with the federal communications commission's regulations concerning radio frequency emissions;\n\n(3) institute, either expressly or de facto, a moratorium on the acceptance or processing of applications or on the issuance of permits or other approvals, if any, for the collocation of small wireless facilities; or\n\n(4) except as otherwise provided in Subsection K of this section, require an application, approval or permit or impose a fee, rate or other charge for:\n\n(a) the routine maintenance of a small wireless facility;\n\n(b) the replacement of a small wireless facility with one that is substantially similar in size to, the same size as or smaller than it, as long as the wireless provider that owns the wireless facility notifies the authority of the replacement at least ten days before the replacement; or\n\n(c) the installation, maintenance, operation, placement or replacement of a micro wireless facility that is, in accordance with applicable codes, suspended on cables strung between utility poles or wireless structures. As used in this subparagraph, \"micro wireless facility\" means a small wireless facility less than twenty-four inches long, fifteen inches wide and twelve inches high whose exterior antenna, if any, is less than eleven inches long.\n\nK. An authority may require a permit to engage, within rights of way, in activities that are identified in Paragraph (4) of Subsection J of this section and that affect traffic patterns or require lane closures.\n\nL. The collocation for which a permit is issued shall begin within one hundred eighty days after the permit issuance date, unless the authority and the wireless provider agree to extend that period or a delay in collocation is caused by the lack of commercial power or fiber at the site. The permit gives the wireless provider the right to:\n\n(1) collocate the small wireless facility; and\n\n(2) subject to applicable relocation requirements, the requirements imposed on the authority by Section 3 of the Wireless Consumer Advanced Infrastructure Investment Act and to the wireless provider's right to terminate collocation at any time:\n\n(a) operate and maintain the small wireless facility for at least ten years; and\n\n(b) renew the permit for the same period, unless the authority finds that the small wireless facility does not conform with the applicable codes and local laws set forth in Paragraph (4) of Subsection E of this section.\n\nM. An authority may charge an applicant an application fee in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100) or less for each of up to five small wireless facilities and fifty dollars ($50.00) or less for each additional small wireless facility whose collocation is requested in a single application.\n\nN. The approval of an application under the Wireless Consumer Advanced Infrastructure Investment Act does not authorize the provision of a service or authorize the installation, placement, maintenance or operation of a wireline backhaul facility in a right of way.\n\nO. The Wireless Consumer Advanced Infrastructure Investment Act shall not be deemed to allow a person, without the consent of the property owner, to collocate a small wireless facility on a privately owned utility pole, a privately owned wireless support structure or private property.\n\nHistory:Laws 2018, ch. 17, § 4 and Laws 2018, ch. 69, § 4.\n\nDuplicate laws.— Laws 2018, ch. 17, § 4 and Laws 2018, ch. 69, § 4, both effective September 1, 2018, enacted identical new sections.
