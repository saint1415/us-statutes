N.M. 2001).\n\nPurpose of bond.— The auto dealer's bond in Section 66-4-7 NMSA 1978 is to protect purchasers from failure of title and is applicable to other acts of alleged fraud or misrepresentation which cause a failure of title.Morey v.

Zangara Dodge, Inc., 2008-NMCA-064, 144 N.M. 61, 183 P.3d 946.\n\nBond was intended not only for protection of a purchaserof an automobile from the bonded dealer, but also a wholesale seller.Commercial Ins.

National Union Fire Ins. Co., 1965-NMSC-073, 75 N.M. 313, 404 P.2d 137.\n\nCreditor unprotected by bond.— Where decedent automobile dealer could not obtain a license to do business as an automobile dealer or obtain a statutory dealer's bond and dealer's friend obtained bond and license for him, customer who gave car to dealer which he subsequently sold and then dealer died was not entitled to protection of statutory dealer's bond since customer was in reality a creditor unprotected by bond.Kerr v. Schwartz, 1970-NMSC-126, 82 N.M. 63, 475 P.2d 457.\n\nSection not applicable.— This section is not applicable where a vehicle was intended to be collateral on a loan and not a purchase.Bennett v. Western Sur. Co., 1980-NMSC-108, 95 N.M. 13, 618 P.2d 357.\n\nFraud not consummated until after title hypothecated to bank.— Bonding company is liable under its policy on the ground that although it was not in force when possession and title to the car were fraudulently taken on January 16, 1957, and the surety bond was issued on the following January 21, and the bond would not be retroactive for frauds perpetrated prior to its effective date, though the fraud might have been conceived prior to the issuance of the bond, it was not consummated until after the title to the automobile was hypothecated to the bank and defendant received the proceeds of the loan some time after the effective date of the bond.Commercial Ins. Co. v. Watson, 261 F.2d 143 (10th Cir. 1958).\n\nNoncompliance with title transfer provisions not failure of title.— The provisions refer to the duties of the dealer and transferee, but noncompliance therewith cannot be considered a failure of title, fraudulent misrepresentation, or breach of warranty as to freedom from liens on a motor vehicle.Prince v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 1965-NMSC-073, 75 N.M. 313, 404 P.2d 137.\n\nFact that alleged principal was licensed automobile dealerunder Section 64-8-1, 1953 Comp. (similar to Section 66-4-1 NMSA 1978) and had, likewise, procured the bond required by Section 64-8-6, 1953 Comp. (similar to this section), was considered favorably in determination that agency relationship existed.State v. DeBaca, 1971-NMCA-092, 82 N.M. 727, 487 P.2d 155.\n\nSection did not apply to mobile homes.— Section 64-8-6, 1953 Comp. (similar to this section), did not apply to the purchase of mobile homes; its bond requirements applied only to the sale of motor vehicles, and a mobile home, being without motive power, could not be a motor vehicle within the meaning of Section 64-8-6, 1953 Comp.Lewallen v. Elmore Mobile Homes, Inc., 1976-NMCA-056, 89 N.M. 323, 551 P.2d 1370.",
