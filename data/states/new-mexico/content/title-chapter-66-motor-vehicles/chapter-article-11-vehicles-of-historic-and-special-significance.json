      "text": "Recognizing the importance of constructive leisure pursuits by New Mexico citizens, this act [66-11-1 to 66-11-5 NMSA 1978] is intended to encourage responsible participation in the hobby of collecting, preserving, restoring and maintaining motor vehicles of historic and special interest. Further, New Mexico, recognizing that the current pattern of resource recycling leads to an ever-shortening period of existence for vehicles of historic or special interest establishes this act to ensure the preservation of our American heritage as it relates to the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. Further, this act recognizes that a vehicle representative of this heritage, being held by a hobbyist, finds significance as an historic or special interest vehicle through a personal relevance to the life of the collector holding it and through a general relevance as an example-artifact of the transportation history of New Mexico.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 64-41-1, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 35, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For special \"horseless carriage\" plates,see66-3-27 NMSA 1978.",
