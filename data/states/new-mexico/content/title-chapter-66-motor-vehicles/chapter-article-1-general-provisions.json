Lomas Auto Mall, 600 F.Supp.2d 1173 (D. N.M. 2009).\n\nMole.— The \"mole\" which is a piece of equipment weighing 100 tons and which is used to move employees and supplies in and out of a tunnel under construction and to remove excavated material out of the tunnel was not special equipment, nor does it come within the general descriptive terms of the definition of special mobile equipment.Gibbons & Reed Co. v.

It was made up of an engine to drive the unit and extendable metal arms used to drill into the well hole. Very little room existed on the truck bed for other items which could be hauled. The cab of the truck was large enough to carry three to four people and to haul items of property. No impediments existed which would restrain the truck's use on the public highways. It did not qualify as a special mobile equipment vehicle under the exemption to vehicle registration. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-27.\n\nDefinition of \"school bus\" may be used in other enactments.— It would not be unreasonable for the corporation commission (now public regulation commission) to look to the legislature's definition of the term \"school bus\" in the former Motor Vehicle Act for a guide to interpreting the exemption provided in the Motor Carrier Act (see now Section 65-2-126 NMSA 1978). 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-110.\n\nWell servicing unit.— While it is true that a \"well servicing unit\" is not included in the statutory definition of special mobile equipment, it would appear that the unit was designed solely and exclusively for the purpose of transporting the particular machinery for which it is designed and for the accommodation of driver for the same. It is not designed primarily for the transportation of persons or property save as an incident of its use at an appropriate location. A well servicing unit is within the general terms of \"special mobile equipment.\" 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-115.\n\nCable spool carrier.— A two wheeled piece of equipment, hitched to a pickup, which tows it, which has no floor, is structured from pipe lengths, is about four feet in height, carries a spool of cable, is never on a public highway except when it is moved from one job to another, the primary purpose being to provide a platform from which the cable is unrolled, is a special mobile equipment vehicle. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-148.\n\nMotor vehicle hauling exceptional loads over roads.— A special motor vehicle rented by a New Mexico firm from an Arizona company and used to haul an exceptional load over New Mexico roads was not \"special mobile equipment,\" despite the fact that it was not normally used for transportation of property over highways. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-95.",
