      "text": "A. Except as provided in Subsection K of this section, cigarettes shall not be sold or offered for sale in New Mexico unless:\n\n(1) the cigarettes have been tested in accordance with the test method and meet the performance standard specified in this section;\n\n(2) a written certification has been filed by the manufacturer with the state fire marshal in accordance with Section 4 [57-2B-4 NMSA 1978] of the Fire-Safer Cigarette and Firefighter Protection Act; and\n\n(3) the cigarettes have been marked in accordance with Section 5 [57-2B-5 NMSA 1978] of that act.\n\nB. Testing of cigarettes shall be conducted in accordance with the American society of testing and materials standard E2187-04 standard test method for measuring the ignition strength of cigarettes and shall be conducted on ten layers of filter paper. No more than twenty-five percent of the cigarettes tested in a test trial in accordance with this section shall exhibit full-length burns. Forty replicate tests shall constitute a complete test trial for each cigarette tested. The performance standard required by this section shall only be applied to a complete test trial. Written certifications shall be based upon testing conducted by a laboratory that has been accredited pursuant to standard ISO/IEC 17025 of the international organization for standardization or other comparable accreditation standard required by the state fire marshal.\n\nC. Laboratories conducting testing in accordance with this section shall implement a quality control and quality assurance program that includes a procedure that will determine the repeatability of the testing results. The repeatability value shall be no greater than 0.19.\n\nD. Testing performed or sponsored by the state fire marshal to determine a cigarette's compliance with the performance standard required by this section shall be conducted in accordance with this section.\n\nE. This section does not require additional testing if cigarettes are tested consistent with the Fire-Safer Cigarette and Firefighter Protection Act for any other purpose.\n\nF. Each cigarette listed in a certification submitted pursuant to Section 4 of the Fire-Safer Cigarette and Firefighter Protection Act that uses lowered permeability bands in the cigarette paper to achieve compliance with the performance standard set forth in this section shall have at least two nominally identical bands on the paper surrounding the tobacco column. At least one complete band shall be located at least fifteen millimeters from the lighting end of the cigarette. For cigarettes on which the bands are positioned by design, there shall be at least two bands fully located at least fifteen millimeters from the lighting end and ten millimeters from the filter end of the tobacco column or ten millimeters from the labeled end of the tobacco column for non-filtered cigarettes.\n\nG. A manufacturer of a cigarette that the state fire marshal determines cannot be tested in accordance with the test method prescribed in Subsection B of this section shall propose a test method and performance standard for the cigarette to the state fire marshal. Upon approval of the proposed test method and a determination by the state fire marshal that the performance standard proposed by the manufacturer is equivalent to the performance standard prescribed in Subsection B of this section, the manufacturer may employ that test method and performance standard to certify the cigarette pursuant to Section 4 of the Fire-Safer Cigarette and Firefighter Protection Act. If the state fire marshal determines that another state has enacted reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards that include a test method and performance standard that are the same as those contained in the Fire-Safer Cigarette and Firefighter Protection Act, and the state fire marshal finds that the officials responsible for implementing those requirements have approved the proposed alternative test method and performance standard for a particular cigarette proposed by a manufacturer as meeting the fire safety standards of that state's law or regulation under a legal provision comparable to this section, the state fire marshal shall authorize that manufacturer to employ the alternative test method and performance standard to certify that cigarette for sale in New Mexico, unless the state fire marshal demonstrates a reasonable basis why the alternative test should not be accepted under the Fire-Safer Cigarette and Firefighter Protection Act. All other applicable requirements of this section shall apply to the manufacturer.\n\nH. Each manufacturer shall maintain copies of the reports of all tests conducted on all cigarettes offered for sale for a period of three years and shall make copies of the reports available to the state fire marshal and the attorney general upon written request. Any manufacturer who fails to make copies of the reports available within sixty days of receiving a written request may be assessed a civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each day after the sixtieth day that the manufacturer does not make the copies available.\n\nI. The state fire marshal may adopt a subsequent American society of testing and materials standard test method for measuring the ignition strength of cigarettes upon a finding that the subsequent method does not result in a change in the percentage of full-length burns exhibited by any tested cigarette when compared to the percentage of full-length burns the same cigarette would exhibit when tested in accordance with the American society of testing and materials standard E2187-04 and the performance standard in Subsection B of this section.\n\nJ. The state fire marshal shall review the effectiveness of this section and report findings and make recommendations to the legislature every three years.\n\nK. The requirements of Subsection A of this section shall not prohibit:\n\n(1) wholesale or retail dealers from selling their existing inventory of cigarettes on or after the effective date of this section if the wholesale or retail dealer can establish that state tax stamps were affixed to the cigarettes prior to the effective date and the wholesale or retail dealer can establish that the inventory was purchased prior to the effective date in comparable quantity to the inventory purchased during the same period of the prior year; or\n\n(2) the sale of cigarettes solely for the purpose of consumer testing. For purposes of this subsection, the term \"consumer testing\" means an assessment of cigarettes that is conducted by a manufacturer, or under the control and direction of a manufacturer, for the purpose of evaluating consumer acceptance of the cigarettes, utilizing only the quantity of cigarettes that is reasonably necessary for an assessment.\n\nL. The Fire-Safer Cigarette and Firefighter Protection Act shall be interpreted and construed to effectuate its general purpose and to make that act uniform with the laws of those states that have enacted reduced cigarette ignition propensity laws as of the date that the Fire-Safer Cigarette and Firefighter Protection Act is enacted.\n\nHistory:Laws 2009, ch. 265, § 3.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2009, ch. 265, § 13 made Laws 2009, ch. 265, § 3 effective January 1, 2010.",

Each manufacturer shall submit to the state fire marshal a written certification attesting that each cigarette listed in the certification has been tested in accordance with the test method and meets the performance standard in Section 3 [57-2B-3 NMSA 1978] of the Fire-Safer Cigarette and Firefighter Protection Act.\n\nB. Each cigarette listed in the certification shall be described with the following information:\n\n(1) the brand or the trade name on the package;\n\n(2) the style, such as light or ultralight;\n\n(3) the length in millimeters;\n\n(4) the circumference in millimeters;\n\n(5) the flavor, such as menthol or chocolate, if applicable;\n\n(6) whether the cigarette has a filter or is a nonfilter cigarette;\n\n(7) the package description, such as soft pack or box;\n\n(8) the marking pursuant to Section 5 [57-2B-5 NMSA 1978] of the Fire-Safer Cigarette and Firefighter Protection Act;\n\n(9) the name, address and telephone number of the laboratory, if different than the manufacturer that conducted the test; and\n\n(10) the date that the testing occurred.\n\nC.

Each cigarette certified under this section shall be recertified every three years.\n\nE. For each cigarette listed in a certification, a manufacturer shall pay to the state fire marshal a fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250). The state fire marshal may adjust the amount of the fee by rule on an annual basis as necessary to defray the costs of processing, testing, enforcement and oversight activities required by the Fire-Safer Cigarette and Firefighter Protection Act, but in no case shall the fee exceed four hundred dollars ($400). The state fire marshal may establish the amount of the fee by rule on an annual basis.\n\nF. If a manufacturer has certified a cigarette pursuant to this section, and thereafter makes any change to the cigarette that is likely to alter its compliance with the reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards required by the Fire-Safer Cigarette and Firefighter Protection Act, that cigarette shall not be sold or offered for sale in New Mexico until the manufacturer retests the cigarette in accordance with the testing standards set forth in Section 3 of that act and maintains records of that retesting as required by Section 3 of that act. Any altered cigarette that does not meet the performance standard set forth in Section 3 of that act shall not be sold in New Mexico.\n\nHistory:Laws 2009, ch. 265, § 4.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2009, ch. 265, § 13 made Laws 2009, ch. 265, § 4 effective January 1, 2010.",
