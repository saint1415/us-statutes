      "text": "Every contract, agreement, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce, any part of which trade or commerce is within this state, is unlawful.\n\nHistory:Laws 1891, ch. 10, § 1; C.L. 1897, § 1292; Code 1915, § 1685; C.S. 1929, § 35-2901; 1941 Comp., § 51-1101; 1953 Comp., § 49-1-1; Laws 1979, ch. 374, § 1; 1987, ch. 37, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For unfair trade practices generally,see57-12-1 to 57-12-22 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor provision that actions of cooperative associations are not in restraint of trade,see53-4-42 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor cooperative marketing associations not being in restraint of trade,see76-12-18 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, deleted the Subsection A designation from the beginning, deleted \"hereby declared to be\" preceding \"unlawful\", and deleted Subsection B, concerning controlling the quantity, price or exchange of goods in restraint of trade.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nUnderlying purposes behind both federal and state antitrust laws are same,to establish a public policy of first magnitude; that is, promoting the national interest in a competitive economy.United Nuclear Corp. v. General Atomic Co., 1979-NMSC-036, 93 N.M. 105, 597 P.2d 290, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 911, 100 S. Ct. 222, 62 L. Ed. 2d 145 (1979).\n\nState action immunity doctrine.— The rationale underlying the state action immunity doctrine does not apply to causes of action brought pursuant to the New Mexico Antitrust Act, which does not implicate the relationship between federal and state governments.City of Sunland Park v. Macias, 2003-NMCA-098, 134 N.M. 216, 75 P.3d 816, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 179, 74 P.3d 1071.\n\nState's trusts policy subject to legislature's control and modification.— The policy of the state with reference to trusts and combinations in restraint of trade as declared in 57-1-1 to 57-1-3 NMSA 1978 is within the control of the legislature and subject to modification by it.Elephant Butte Alfalfa Ass'n v. Rouault, 1926-NMSC-009, 33 N.M. 136, 262 P. 185.\n\nTo be violative, contract's object or operation must restrict trade.— In order for a contract to be violative of the statute, it must have been one having for its object, or which would operate to restrict trade or commerce, or control the quantity, price or exchange of article in question.State v. Gurley, 1919-NMSC-017, 25 N.M. 233, 180 P. 288.\n\nMere refusal to sell, in itself, does not provide basis for reliefunder this section.Rogers v. Consolidated Distribs., Inc., 1981-NMCA-010, 95 N.M. 467, 623 P.2d 587.\n\nCovenants not to compete.— Covenants not to compete that restrict employment present competing principles: the freedom to contract and the freedom to work. A covenant not to compete is enforceable if the restrictions imposed are reasonable. Whether there is a reasonable restraint depends on the facts of a particular case. Covenants not to compete with reasonable restraints will be enforced when they are not against public policy, and any detriment to the public interest in the possible loss of the services of the covenantor is more than offset by the public benefit arising out of the preservation of the freedom of contract.KidsKare v. Mann, 2015-NMCA-064.\n\nIn an action to enforce a covenant not to compete, where the covenant specifically provided for the amendment of any provision found by a court to be overbroad or otherwise unenforceable, and further provided for the enforceability to the maximum extent deemed reasonable by such court, and that all provisions not found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, were to remain intact and enforceable, the district court did not err in reforming the covenant not to compete because the parties agreed to the type of reformation performed by the district court.KidsKare v. Mann, 2015-NMCA-064.\n\nTime period and distance restrictions in covenant not to compete were reasonable.— In an action to enforce a covenant not to compete, a one-year time period and thirty-mile distance restriction were deemed reasonable and enforceable where the defendant conceded that a restriction of one or two years is frequently found to be reasonable in the field of dentistry and evidence showed that ninety percent of plaintiff's patients came from within a thirty-mile radius.KidsKare v. Mann, 2015-NMCA-064.\n\nFifteen-year noncompetition covenant in contract for sale of insurance business was not voidas a restraint of trade.Bowen v. Carlsbad Ins. & Real Estate, Inc., 1986-NMSC-060, 104 N.M. 514, 724 P.2d 223.\n\nConspiracy to fix prices is per se restraint of trade;this means that the reasonableness of the prices is not an issue, i.e., the \"rule of reason\" does not apply to per se restraints of trade.State v. Ray Bell Oil Co., 1983-NMCA-068, 101 N.M. 368, 683 P.2d 50, cert. quashed, 101 N.M. 362, 683 P.2d 44, appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 1030, 105 S. Ct. 498, 83 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1984).\n\nTying arrangementexists when a seller conditions a buyer's purchase of a desired product (the tying product) on the buyer's agreement to purchase an undesired product (the tied product); a requirement by a manufacturer that its dealers purchase all of the manufacturer's products is a tying arrangement often referred to as \"full-line forcing,\" while a requirement that only a portion of the products be stocked is referred to as \"representative-line forcing.\"Smith Mach. Corp. v. Hesston, Inc., 1985-NMSC-004, 102 N.M. 245, 694 P.2d 501.\n\nTying analysis should apply even though the business relationship at issue is solely between a manufacturer and a dealer without directly involving the ultimate consumer.Smith Mach. Corp. v. Hesston, Inc., 1985-NMSC-004, 102 N.M. 245, 694 P.2d 501.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"New Mexico Restraint of Trade Statutes - A Legislative Proposal,\" see 9 N.M.L.

PARTIAL, REASONABLE OR INCIDENTAL RESTRAINT.\n\nPartial and reasonable restraints with consideration are valid.— Contracts only in partial restraint of any particular trade or employment, if founded upon a sufficient consideration, are valid and enforceable, if the restraint be confined within limits which are no larger and wider than the protection of the party with whom the contract is made may reasonably require. Nichols v. Anderson, 1939-NMSC-028, 43 N.M. 296, 92 P.2d 781; Excelsior Laundry Co. v. Diehl, 1927-NMSC-007, 32 N.M. 169, 252 P. 991.\n\nSome restrictive franchise provisions may be valid.— Franchise agreement prohibiting sale of competing products from a specified location was a partial and reasonable restraint of trade and did not violate this section. Yarborough v. Harkey, 1960-NMSC-064, 67 N.M. 204, 354 P.2d 137.\n\nAnti-competition agreement void unless incidental to general or principal transaction.— A naked agreement by one party not to engage in business in competition with another party is in contravention of public policy and therefore void, unless such agreement and restriction be incidental to some general or principal transaction. Its main object must not be to stifle competition. Nichols v. Anderson, 1939-NMSC-028, 43 N.M. 296, 92 P.2d 781; Gross, Kelly & Co. v. Bibo, 1914-NMSC-085, 19 N.M. 495, 145 P. 480.\n\nRefraining from engaging in business valid if subsidiary.— An agreement to refrain from engaging in a certain business or profession within reasonable limits of time and place is valid if subsidiary to other legitimate purposes such as the sale or disposal of property, business or good will. Nichols v. Anderson, 1939-NMSC-028, 43 N.M. 296, 92 P.2d 781; Thomas v. Gavin, 1910-NMSC-060, 15 N.M. 660, 110 P. 841; Gallup Elec. Light Co. v. Pacific Improvement Co., 1911-NMSC-012, 16 N.M. 86, 113 P. 848; Gross, Kelly & Co. v. Bibo, 1914-NMSC-085, 19 N.M. 495, 145 P. 480; Gonzales v. Reynolds, 1929-NMSC-018, 34 N.M. 35, 275 P. 922.\n\nIII. PROOF OF RESTRAINT.\n\nCompliance with federal substantive law as it relates to oligopolies.— To ensure uniform application of federal and state laws in antitrust actions under the Antitrust Act, 57-1-1 to 57-1-15 NMSA 1978, involving oligopolies, such as the tobacco industry, which are by nature interdependent such that it is likely that when one company acts in a certain manner, the other firms will determine whether it is in their best interest to follow the leader's action, plaintiffs must meet the standard of federal substantive antitrust law which requires that to show that there was an unlawful agreement, plaintiffs must present evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that defendants acted independently or plaintiffs cannot meet their burden of establishing a genuine issue of material fact to withstand summary judgment for defendants. Romero v. Philip Morris, Inc., 2010-NMSC-035, 148 N.M. 713, 242 P.3d 280,rev'g, 2009-NMCA-022, 145 N.M. 658, 203 P.3d 873.\n\nEvidence of \"plus factors\" did not exclude the possibility of independent action.— Where plaintiffs alleged that defendants engaged in an agreement to fix the price of cigarettes; defendants were large manufacturers of cigarettes; defendant Philip Morris reduced wholesale prices on all brands; the other defendants followed the price reductions; defendants then began to increase wholesale prices in near lock-step fashion; and plaintiffs offered evidence of parallel pricing behavior, the economies of the market place, motivation to conspire, condensation of price tiers, actions contrary to self-interest, conspiratorial meetings in foreign markets, a smoking and health conspiracy, defendants monitoring the market through a business data service, opportunities to conspire, and pricing decisions made at high levels, the district court properly granted summary judgment for defendants, because plaintiffs' evidence was just as consistent with lawful, independent actions as it was with price fixing and did not exclude independent conduct that was required to raise a genuine issue of material fact that there was an agreement among defendants to fix the price of cigarettes and, because defendants offered evidence of fierce retail competition that undermined the plausibility of a price-fixing agreement, that wholesale prices did not exceed the wholesale price levels that existed at the time defendants began to lower prices until almost five years later, and that plaintiffs' expert acknowledged that it was just as likely that defendants would have behaved in the same manner if they were acting independently and not under a price-fixing agreement. Romero v. Philip Morris, Inc., 2010-NMSC-035, 148 N.M. 713, 242 P.3d 280,rev'g2009-NMCA-022, 145 N.M. 658, 203 P.3d 873.\n\nConscious parallelism.— Behavior of market participants that is characterizable as mere conscious parallelism, which is parallel price changes by firms in a concentrated market who recognize their independence, does not satisfy the conspiracy element required by 57-1-1 NMSA 1978. Romero v. Philip Morris, Inc., 2009-NMCA-022, 145 N.M. 658, 203 P.3d 873;rev'd, Romero v. Philip Morris, Inc., 2010-NMSC-035,148 N.M. 713, 242 P.3d 280.\n\nEvidence to rule out conscious parallelism.— Testimony by a qualified economics expert that the character or degree of parallelism actually exhibited by prices exceeds the parallelism that economic theory predicts would result from independent competitive behavior is evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that firms in a concentrated market acted independently. Romero v. Philip Morris, Inc., 2009-NMCA-022, 145 N.M. 658, 203 P.3d 873;rev'd, Romero v. Philip Morris, Inc., 2010-NMSC-035, 148 N.M. 713, 242 P.3d 280.\n\nWhere the plaintiff alleged that cigarette manufacturers conspired during a seven year period to fix the prices of cigarettes in New Mexico and where the plaintiff's evidence showed that during the seven year period the tobacco industry exhibited an unprecedented degree of parallelism; what had previously been ten price tiers had been consolidated into two price tiers; twelve in-tandem increases occurred in the prices of both premium and discount cigarettes; the multi-variable, multi-price-tier parallelism went well beyond the price leadership within a single-tier market demonstrated by the cigarette industry prior to the introduction of generic cigarettes; and the parallelism involved parallelism among market tiers that formerly had been in vigorous competition, the evidence allowed a reasonable fact finder to reject conscious parallelism as a plausible explanation for the parallelism in the cigarette industry, thereby leaving the competing inference of conspiracy as the most likely explanation for the parallelism. Romero v. Philip Morris, Inc., 2009-NMCA-022, 145 N.M. 658, 203 P.3d 873;rev'd, Romero v. Philip Morris, Inc., 2010-NMSC-035, 148 N.M. 713, 242 P.3d 280.\n\nTo establish an antitrust law violation,the plaintiff must show a conspiracy or combination among two or more persons and an unreasonable restraint of trade due to this combination or conspiracy. Clough v. Adventist Health Sys., Inc., 1989-NMSC-056, 108 N.M. 801, 780 P.2d 627.\n\nMere contacts and communications, or the mere opportunity to conspire, among antitrust defendants is insufficient evidence from which to infer an anticompetitive conspiracy in the context of the denial of hospital surgical privileges. Clough v. Adventist Health Sys., Inc., 1989-NMSC-056, 108 N.M. 801, 780 P.2d 627.\n\nMust show scheming and attempt to combine with others.— Where contract between distributor and manufacturer is alleged to violate antitrust acts as in restraint of trade, it is not enough to show that the manufacturer has schemed and labored to effect restraint of trade. It must be shown that it has contracted or combined with others to that end. W.T. Rawleigh Co. v. Jones, 1935-NMSC-056, 39 N.M. 381, 47 P.2d 906.\n\nProof of per se illegal tying arrangement.— To prevail on a claim that a tying arrangement is per se illegal, a plaintiff must prove the existence of three distinct elements: (1) a scheme involving two distinct products whereby a buyer must purchase the tied product in order to obtain the tying product; (2) a seller possessing sufficient economic power in the tying product market to appreciably restrain competition in the tied product market; and (3) an arrangement affecting a not insubstantial amount of commerce. Smith Mach. Corp. v. Hesston, Inc., 1985-NMSC-004, 102 N.M. 245, 694 P.2d 501.\n\nPrima facie case of per se antitrust violation in tying arrangement was presentedwhere dealer was compelled to purchase tractors in order to obtain windrowers and other equipment, where manufacturer's economic power in tying product was demonstrated by a 30% market share and where amount of commerce foreclosed ranged from $100,000 to $300,000. Smith Mach. Corp. v. Hesston, Inc., 1985-NMSC-004, 102 N.M. 245, 694 P.2d 501.\n\nIndictment which shows only large profit alleges no violation.— An indictment under this section or 57-1-2 NMSA 1978 alleging a contract whereby another would obtain the selling agency for all broom corn produced by farmers in the vicinity, and would sell it to defendant at $150 per ton, when it was then worth $350 per ton, did not show a violation of the statute. State v. Gurley, 1919-NMSC-017, 25 N.M. 233, 180 P. 288.\n\nAllegations insufficient if related only to interstate sales.— Allegations of the proposed counterclaim held insufficient where, even though filed pursuant to New Mexico statutes, they related solely to purchases and sales made in interstate commerce and contained no allegations of an unlawful agreement, combination or conspiracy to restrict or monopolize trade or commerce within the state of New Mexico as required by 57-1-1 through 57-1-3 NMSA 1978. State ex rel. Pennsylvania Transformer Div. v. Electric. City Supply Co., 1964-NMSC-136, 74 N.M. 295, 393 P.2d 325.\n\nBoth interstate and intrastate violations alleged.— Assuming, arguendo, that the New Mexico antitrust and price discrimination statutes involved apply only to intrastate commerce, plaintiffs' affidavit accompanying their opposition to the defendant's motions to dismiss averred that plaintiffs complained of unfair competition within New Mexico as well as between New Mexico and Texas distributors, and since the mere fact that plaintiffs' volume had increased would not negate the possibility of actual harm, the motions to dismiss were denied. Ingram v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 252 F. Supp. 674 (D.N.M. 1966).\n\nIssue of competition involves questions of geographic proximity and marketing practices.Where one defendant company had distributed entirely through jobbers and with the company itself absorbing any loss as a result of price reductions in the area during the period in question so that all jobbers retained the same profit margin before and after the alleged price discrimination, and furthermore, where the nearest jobber to plaintiff was too distant geographically (54 miles) to be considered in competition with him, it was held that plaintiff itself negated any possibility of establishing a competitive relationship with defendant under either the United States or New Mexico antitrust laws, and that defendant's pricing policies, different from the policies of the other defendants, were inconsistent with plaintiffs' conspiracy count which basically alleged selective price reductions to monopolize the gasoline distributors market; thus, in the absence of any basis for allegations of competition or conspiracy on the part of defendant, the claims against it were dismissed and its motion for summary judgment was granted. Ingram v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 252 F. Supp. 674 (D.N.M. 1966).\n\nTranscript must show lack of alleged violator's justification.— Where plaintiff sued board of realtors alleging a combination in restraint of trade, a combination tending to monopolize trade and that he was injured by the alleged combination, but where there was no reference in the transcript to items which tended to show or raise a factual issue as to lack of justification for the board's practices, as was required by former 21-2-1(15)(6), 1953 Comp., the trial court's summary judgment was affirmed on procedural grounds by the court of appeals. Wilson v. Albuquerque Bd. of Realtors, 1971-NMCA-090, 82 N.M. 717, 487 P.2d 145.\n\nPreclusion based on insufficiency of evidence.— Where a plaintiff argued that preclusion should not have applied because he was not given an opportunity in the state case to pursue discovery to prove his conspiracy claims and that defendants intentionally withheld information in the state case, and where the plaintiff maintained that because the state court summary judgment was based on insufficiency of the evidence, rather than litigation of actual factual issues, preclusion did not apply, preclusion still applied; the plaintiff was afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate his claims, there was no evidence that defendants had fraudulently withheld evidence, and the state court had considered the merits of all the claims. Clough v. Rush, 959 F.2d 182 (10th Cir. 1992).\n\nWholesalers may refuse to sell when goods used illegally.— These provisions do not make it unlawful for either a wholesaler or a group of wholesalers to refuse to sell their goods to a firm or individual intending to use them in contravention of law. 1943 Op.

The attorney general may bring an action under Subsection A of this section on behalf of the state, a political subdivision thereof or any public agency.\n\nC. In any action under this section, any defendant, as a partial or complete defense against a damage claim, may, in order to avoid duplicative liability, be entitled to prove that the plaintiff purchaser or seller in the chain of manufacture, production, or distribution who paid any overcharge or received any underpayment, passed on all or any part of such overcharge or underpayment to another purchaser or seller in such chain.\n\nD. For the purposes of this section, \"business or property\" includes business or nonbusiness purchases and business and nonbusiness injuries.\n\nHistory:Laws 1891, ch. 10, § 3; C.L. 1897, § 1294; Laws 1907, ch. 18, § 1; Code 1915, § 1687; C.S. 1929, § 35-2903; 1941 Comp., § 51-1103; 1953 Comp., § 49-1-3; Laws 1979, ch. 374, § 5.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The cases annotated under 57-1-1 NMSA 1978 are also applicable to this section.\n\nStanding.— Plaintiff alleged that defendant forced merchants who accepted defendants' credit cards to also accept defendant's debit cards which resulted in higher debit processing fees for merchants who were forced to pass the cost on to their customers in the form of higher prices for retail goods; plaintiff sought class certification on behalf of New Mexico consumers; plaintiff was not a consumer or a competitor in the market for credit and debit card services provided by defendants; plaintiff's allegations did not show that plaintiff was directly harmed by the actions of defendants or that plaintiff was indirectly harmed through the chain of distribution of the debit card services; plaintiff was a consumer of goods sold by merchants who happened to be part of the affected market; the merchants who were directly affected by the alleged tying arrangement and who were a better plaintiff had participated in litigation against defendants under federal antitrust laws; plaintiff's damages were speculative because the charges paid by plaintiff on retail items were based on numerous independent factors other than the fees charged by defendants; apportioning damages among class members would be a complex task; and there was a risk of duplicative damages that were paid in prior federal antitrust litigation based on the same issue, plaintiff lacked standing to bring a claim against defendants under the New Mexico Antitrust Act for the alleged tying scheme that forced merchants to accept defendants' debit cards at inflated transaction-fee rates.Nass-Romero v. Visa USA, Inc., 2012-NMCA-058, 279 P.3d 772.\n\nTransfer of counterclaim sharing factual questions with other action.— Where an antitrust counterclaim and actions already pending in another district share numerous complex factual questions, transfer of the antitrust counterclaim is necessary to prevent duplicate discovery, eliminate any possibility of conflicting pretrial rulings and conserve time and effort for the parties, the witnesses and the judiciary.In re Uranium Indus. Antitrust Litigation, 466 F.

Ed. 2d 145.\n\nMost effective relief is declaring contract void.— Because the New Mexico Antitrust Act does not provide for treble damages as available to federal litigants, the ability to have a contract declared void is the most effective tool provided by New Mexico law.United Nuclear Corp. v.

The demand shall:\n\n(1) be served upon the person in the manner required for service of process in this state, or, if the person cannot be found or does not reside or maintain a principal place of business within this state, in the manner required for service of process in the state in which the person resides, maintains a principal place of business or can be found;\n\n(2) describe the nature of the conduct under investigation;\n\n(3) describe the class or classes of documents or objects with sufficient definiteness to permit them to be fairly identified, if the production of documents or objects is requested;\n\n(4) contain a copy of the written interrogatories, if answers to written interrogatories are sought;\n\n(5) prescribe a reasonable time at which the person must appear to testify, within which to answer the written interrogatories or within which the document or object must be produced;\n\n(6) specify a place for the taking of testimony or for production and designate a person who may be an authorized employee of the attorney general, to be custodian of the document or object; and\n\n(7) contain a copy of Subsections B, C and D of this section.\n\nNo demand to produce a document or object for inspection and copying shall contain any requirement which would be unreasonable or improper if contained in a subpoena duces tecum issued in a civil proceeding by a district court of this state.\n\nThe district court shall approve the demand if it finds that the attorney general has reasonable cause to believe that a person has information or may be in possession, custody or control of any document or other tangible object relevant to a civil investigation for violation of Section 57-1-1 or 57-1-2 NMSA 1978 and that the demand is proper in form. A demand shall not be issued without approval of the district court.\n\nB. If a person fails to comply with the written demand served upon him under the provisions of Subsection A of this section, the attorney general may file in the district court of the county in which the person resides or in which he maintains a principal place of business within this state or of the county of Santa Fe if the person neither resides nor has a principal place of business in this state a petition for an order to enforce the demand. Notice of hearing the petition and a copy of the petition shall be served upon the person, who may appear in opposition to the petition.

Upon motion by the person and for good cause shown, the court may make any further protective order in the proceedings that justice requires.\n\nC. Prior to the filing of an action under the provisions of the Antitrust Act for the violation under investigation, any testimony taken or material produced under this section shall be kept confidential by the attorney general unless confidentiality is waived by the person being investigated and the person who has testified, answered interrogatories or produced material, or disclosure is authorized by the court. All court records, including docket, application, petitions, motions and other papers filed under this section shall be open to inspection only to the attorney general and the person upon whom the demand for which inspection is sought has been served, unless otherwise ordered by the court.\n\nD. Any person compelled to appear under this section and required to testify under oath may be accompanied, represented and advised by counsel. An objection may properly be made, received and entered upon the record when it is claimed that such person is entitled to refuse to answer the question on grounds of any constitutional or other legal right or privilege.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 57-1-5, enacted by Laws 1979, ch. 374, § 6.\n\nRecompilations.— Laws 1979, ch. 374, § 18, recompiles former 57-1-5 NMSA 1978, relating to limitation of purchases, as 57-1-18 NMSA 1978.\n\nConstitutionality of civil investigative demands.— Constitutional restrictions on government searches and seizures do not impose a requirement that civil investigative demands (CID) issue only upon a reasonable cause to believe that the Antitrust Act has been or is being violated. The federal constitution requires only that for the issuance of an administrative subpoena the inquiry must be within the authority of the agency, the demand must not be too indefinite, and the information must be reasonably relevant to the purposes of the investigation; also, N.M. Const., art. II, § 10 does not require a \"probability\" showing that the federal constitution does not. Moreover, probable cause does not have the same meaning in the context of administrative searches as it does in the context for searches for evidence of crimes.Wilson Corp. v. State ex rel. Udall, 1996-NMCA-049, 121 N.M. 677, 916 P.2d 1344, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 644, 916 P.2d 844, and cert. denied, 519 U.S. 964, 117 S. Ct. 388, 136 L. Ed. 2d 304.\n\nRequirements for enforcement of civil investigative demands.— The attorney general need not show reasonable cause to believe that the Antitrust Act has been or is being violated before a court can enforce a civil investigative demand (CID); this section is satisfied if the attorney general makes a sworn showing that: the attorney general is conducting an investigation to determine whether the Antitrust Act has been or is being violated, the information sought is relevant to the investigation, and there is reasonable cause to believe that the recipient of the CID possesses the information. If the attorney general makes the necessary showing, the person challenging the CID bears the burden of establishing some impropriety in the CID, such as the absence of proper use, the privileged nature of the information, or the unreasonable burden imposed by the CID.Wilson Corp. v. State ex rel. Udall, 1996-NMCA-049, 121 N.M. 677, 916 P.2d 1344, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 644, 916 P.2d 844, and cert. denied, 519 U.S. 964, 117 S. Ct. 388, 136 L. Ed. 2d 304.\n\nSummary judgment quashing investigations improper.— A summary judgment quashing civil investigative demands (CIDs) on the ground that the attorney general's purpose in seeking them was improper was not warranted since the evidence raised genuine questions of material fact regarding the purpose of the CIDs.Brewer Oil Co. v.
