The duration of the express warranty shall be not less than one year after first delivery of the assistive device to the consumer. In the absence of a written warranty from the manufacturer, the manufacturer shall be deemed to have expressly warranted to the consumer of an assistive device that for a period of one year from the date of first delivery to the consumer, the assistive device will be free from any nonconformity.\n\nB. If a new assistive device does not conform to an applicable express warranty and the consumer reports the nonconformity to the manufacturer, dealer or lessor and makes the assistive device available for repair during the warranty period, the nonconformity shall be repaired at no charge to the consumer.\n\nC. If, after a reasonable attempt to repair, the nonconformity is not repaired, the manufacturer, at the direction of the consumer, shall:\n\n(1) accept return of the assistive device and replace it with a comparable new assistive device and refund any collateral costs within thirty days;\n\n(2) accept return of the assistive device and refund to the consumer and to any holder of a perfected security interest in the consumer's assistive device, as their interest may appear, the full purchase price plus any finance charge amount paid by the consumer at the point of sale and collateral costs; or\n\n(3) if the consumer was a lessee, accept return of the assistive device, refund to the lessor and to any holder of a perfected security interest in the assistive device, as their interest may appear, the current value of the written lease and refund to the consumer the amount that the consumer paid pursuant to the written lease plus any collateral costs.\n\nD. A reasonable allowance for use may be charged to the consumer based on the number of days that the consumer used the assistive device before the consumer first reported the nonconformity to the manufacturer, dealer or lessor.\n\nE. To receive a comparable new assistive device or a refund due pursuant to Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection C of this section, a consumer shall offer to transfer possession of the nonconforming assistive device to the manufacturer. No later than thirty days after the offer, the manufacturer shall provide the consumer with a comparable new assistive device or a refund. When the manufacturer provides the new assistive device or refund, the consumer shall return the nonconforming assistive device to the manufacturer, along with any endorsements necessary to transfer legal possession to the manufacturer.\n\nF. To receive a refund due pursuant to Paragraph (3) of Subsection C of this section, a lessor shall offer to transfer possession of the nonconforming assistive device to the manufacturer. No later than thirty days after the offer, the manufacturer shall provide the refund to the lessor and to any holder of a perfected security interest in the assistive device as his interest may appear. When the manufacturer provides the refund, the lessor shall provide to the manufacturer any endorsements necessary to transfer legal possession to the manufacturer.\n\nG. No person shall enforce the lease against the consumer after the consumer receives a refund due pursuant to Paragraph (3) of Subsection C of this section.\n\nH. No assistive device returned by a consumer or lessor in this or any other state because of a nonconformity shall be resold or re-leased in this state unless full disclosure of the reasons for return is made to any prospective buyer or lessee.\n\nHistory:Laws 1998, ch. 29, § 3.",
