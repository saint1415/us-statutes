      "text": "Chapter 57, Article 12 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Unfair Practices Act\".\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 49-15-1, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 268, § 1; 2003, ch. 167, § 8; 2003, ch. 168, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For provisions relating to unfair insurance practices,seeChapter 59A, Article 16 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, substituted \"Chapter 57, Article 12 NMSA 1978\" for \"This act\".\n\nLaws 2003, ch. 167, § 8, effective July 1, 2003, enacted identical amendments to this section. The section was set out as amended by Laws 2003, ch. 168 § 1.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nApplication to hospitals.— In an unfair practices claim for medical negligence, the inquiry hinges on whether the medical negligence and the unfair practices claims are coterminous or indistinguishable, that is, whether they rely on the same facts and rely on a judgment as to the actual competence of the medical practitioner for resolution. If they do, an unfair practices claim is not appropriate. If they do not, an unfair practices claim may be viable, depending on the facts.Grassie v. Roswell Hosp. Corp., 2011-NMCA-024, 150 N.M. 283, 258 P.3d 1075, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-002.\n\nWhere plaintiff claimed damages against a hospital for medical malpractice and unfair practices; the unfair practices claim was based on the hospital's billboard and internet advertising that described the hospital's team of physicians, nurses and technicians and the hospital's emergency room goal to provide 24-hour, seven-day-a-week access to qualified physicians, the resolution of the issue whether the advertising was materially misleading did not rely on the actions of the medical personnel and the unfair practices claim was sufficiently separate from the medical competence of the doctors and nurses to allow the unfair practice claim to proceed.Grassie v. Roswell Hosp. Corp., 2011-NMCA-024, 150 N.M. 283, 258 P.3d 1075, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-002.\n\nAuthority to determine burial arrangements.— Where a cemetery sold two adjoining burial plots to a husband and wife; in the course of excavating the burial plot for the deceased husband the cemetery discovered the remains of a unidentified body in the wife's burial plot; the wife elected to convert the husband's single burial plot into a double burial plot, the cemetery did not violate the Unfair Practices Act when it sold the burial plots because the cemetery did not knowingly make a misrepresentation of fact that both burial plots were available.Eisert v. Archdiocese of Santa Fe, 2009-NMCA-042, 146 N.M. 179, 207 P.3d 1156, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-004, 146 N.M. 641, 213 P.3d 791.\n\nConflict with federal law.— In action against moving company for fraud, breach of contract, and unfair practices, the specific preclusion of punitive damages under the Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act, former 49 U.S.C. § 11707 created a conflict with the Unfair Trade Practices Act (Chapter 57, Article 12 NMSA 1978) and therefore federal law controlled.Margetson v. United Van Lines, 785 F. Supp. 917 (D.N.M. 1991).\n\nUniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act.— The Unfair Practices Act is modeled after the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act.Stevenson v. Louis Dreyfus Corp., 1991-NMSC-051, 112 N.M. 97, 811 P.2d 1308.\n\nLiberal construction.— Because the Unfair Practices Act constitutes remedial legislation, its provisions are liberally interpreted to facilitate and accomplish its purposes and intent.State ex rel. Stratton v. Gurley Motor Co., 1987-NMCA-063, 105 N.M. 803, 737 P.2d 1180, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 781, 737 P.2d 893.\n\nRemedies not exclusive.— Causes of action may be maintained under both the New Mexico Unfair Trade Practices Act and the New Mexico Unfair Insurance Practices Act.N.M. Life Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Quinn & Co., 1991-NMSC-036, 111 N.M. 750, 809 P.2d 1278.\n\nClaims must be based on regular course of trade or commerce.— Claims made under the Unfair Practices Act must be based on conduct occurring in defendant's regular course of trade or commerce.Klein v. Bronstein, 39 B.R. 20 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1984).\n\nConduct complained of must have occurred in the regular course of business.— Where plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking a determination that a debt arising from a prepetition state court default judgment against bankruptcy debtors in connection with their sale of a mobile home to plaintiffs was non-dischargeable, and where the default judgment included an award of treble damages under the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act (UPA), §§ 57-12-1 through § 57-12-26 NMSA 1978, treble damages were not proper because the UPA does not apply to the purchase and sale of the mobile home on which the default judgment was based. The sale was an isolated consumer transaction and one of the requirements of the UPA to apply is that the conduct complained of must have occurred in the regular course of business.In re Crespin, 551 B.R. 886 (2016).\n\nA business has standing under the Unfair Practices Act to sue a competitor for misrepresentation.— A business has standing under the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act to sue a competitor for misrepresentations that damage the business by misleading or confusing the consuming public when the unfair practice occurs in connection with the sale of goods or services.First Nat'l Bancorp Inc. v. Alley, 76 F.Supp.3d 1261 (D.N.M. 2014).\n\nWhere it was alleged that defendants, an investment services firm, confused and misled former and potential customers of plaintiff, a competitor investment firm, by using a name confusingly similar to plaintiff's name, by creating a website that was confusingly similar to plaintiff's website, and by making misleading statements to plaintiff's existing or potential customers, denial of defendants' motion to dismiss was appropriate because plaintiff was likely to be damaged and may have suffered monetary losses due to defendants' misrepresentations.First Nat'l Bancorp Inc. v. Alley, 76 F.Supp.3d 1261 (D.N.M. 2014).\n\nPreemption by federal law.— Claim under the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act was preempted by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.Nechero v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co., 795 F. Supp. 374 (D.N.M. 1992).\n\nThe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) did not preempt an insured's pre-plan fraud claims against its insurer.Woodworker's Supply, Inc. v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 170 F.3d 985 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\nClaims against Medicare program operator not preempted.— Plaintiffs' claims under the Unfair Practices Act that alleged a \"Medicare Plus Choice\" program operator disseminated knowingly false and misleading statements and representations to thousands of elderly and disabled beneficiaries regarding rates and benefits in order to induce them to enroll, and that the recipients relied on the statements and misrepresentations to enroll but then saw their benefits unilaterally reduced by the operator, were not preempted either expressly by former 42 U.S.C. § 1396w-26(b)(3)(B) or by the doctrine of conflict preemption.Palmer v. St. Joseph Healthcare P.S.O., Inc., 2003-NMCA-118, 134 N.M. 405, 77 P.3d 560, cert. dismissed, 2004-NMCERT-010, 136 N.M. 542, 101 P.3d 808.\n\nFailure of evidence to support claim.— Where evidence was never presented that a party knowingly made any false or misleading statement of any kind in connection with the negotiation of an oral agreement, the evidence failed to present or support an issue essential to the legal sufficiency of the asserted claim, and the trial court erred when it denied a motion for a directed verdict on an Unfair Practices Act violation claim.Stevenson v. Louis Dreyfus Corp., 1991-NMSC-051, 112 N.M. 97, 811 P.2d 1308;Aetna Fin. Co. v. Gaither, 1994-NMSC-082, 118 N.M. 246, 880 P.2d 857;Parker v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., 1995-NMCA-086, 121 N.M. 120, 909 P.2d 1.\n\nMisrepresentation claim was a viable claim.— Where, in January 2006, plaintiff retained defendant to file suit against a high school and a school district under the premises liability provision of the Tort Claims Act; defendant never filed suit within the statute of limitations; plaintiff sued defendant for legal malpractice and misrepresentation; the statute of limitations ran in September 2006; in October 2006, defendant assured plaintiff that the statute of limitations had not run; in August 2007, defendant realized that the case was barred, but did not disclose this fact to plaintiff until the spring of 2008; plaintiff claimed that defendant failed to inform plaintiff that defendant had not done any work on the case; and plaintiff did not allege any damages other than the loss of the underlying suit against the high school and school district, plaintiff could pursue the misrepresentation claim both because plaintiff might have suffered actual damages as a result of defendant's misrepresentations and because fraudulent misrepresentation does not require actual damages.Encinias v. Whitener Law Firm, P.A., 2013-NMSC-045,rev'g2013-NMCA-003, 294 P.3d 1245.\n\nEvidence did not support plaintiff's claim.— Where plaintiff retained defendant to file a tort claim against a school district; defendant failed to file the lawsuit within the statute of limitations; plaintiff sued defendant for violation of the Unfair Practices Act based on allegedly misleading advertisements about defendant's abilities made on a magnet in a phone book and in a television commercial; in the television commercial, defendant was featured as saying \"don't accept a quick check until you check with me\" and mentioned car accidents; and the phone book magnet had the same language printed on it and listed defendant's areas of practice as \"serious injuries, auto accidents, and wrongful death\", plaintiff failed to make a prima facie case for a claim under the act.Encinias v. Whitener Law Firm, P.A., 2013-NMCA-003, 294 P.3d 1245, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-012,rev'd, 2013-NMSC-045.\n\nAct does not apply.— Several developers' action under the New Mexico Unfair Trade Practices Act, was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim because the developers failed to show that the UTPA applied to opponents of a shopping center.Saylor v. Valles, 2003-NMCA-037, 133 N.M. 432, 63 P.3d 1152.\n\nDismissal of claim in error.— Where, under the facts pleaded, it is possible that plaintiffs could show that defendant failed to deliver the quality or quantity of goods or services contracted for, dismissal of claim for violation of Unfair Practices Act was in error.Dellaria & Carnes v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 2004-NMCA-132, 136 N.M. 552, 102 P.3d 111.\n\nWhether bank breached its duty under the Unfair Practices Actby failing to disclose a new policy to its customers, and whether that omission was made in bad faith will require proof of whether and when members received notice of the policy.Brooks v. Norwest Corp., 2004-NMCA-134, 136 N.M. 599, 103 P.3d 39, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-012, 136 N.M. 665, 103 P.3d 1097.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Consumer Class Actions Under the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act,\" see 4 N.M.

      "text": "As used in the Unfair Practices Act:\n\nA. \"person\" means, where applicable, natural persons, corporations, trusts, partnerships, associations, cooperative associations, clubs, companies, firms, joint ventures or syndicates;\n\nB. \"seller-initiated telephone sale\" means a sale, lease or rental of goods or services in which the seller or the seller's representative solicits the sale by telephoning the prospective purchaser and in which the sale is consummated entirely by telephone or mail, but does not include a transaction:\n\n(1) in which a person solicits a sale from a prospective purchaser who has previously made an authorized purchase from the seller's business; or\n\n(2) in which the purchaser is accorded the right of rescission by the provisions of the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. 1635, or regulations issued pursuant thereto;\n\nC. \"trade\" or \"commerce\" includes the advertising, offering for sale or distribution of any services and any property and any other article, commodity or thing of value, including any trade or commerce directly or indirectly affecting the people of this state;\n\nD. \"unfair or deceptive trade practice\" means an act specifically declared unlawful pursuant to the Unfair Practices Act, a false or misleading oral or written statement, visual description or other representation of any kind knowingly made in connection with the sale, lease, rental or loan of goods or services or in the extension of credit or in the collection of debts by a person in the regular course of the person's trade or commerce, that may, tends to or does deceive or mislead any person and includes:\n\n(1) representing goods or services as those of another when the goods or services are not the goods or services of another;\n\n(2) causing confusion or misunderstanding as to the source, sponsorship, approval or certification of goods or services;\n\n(3) causing confusion or misunderstanding as to affiliation, connection or association with or certification by another;\n\n(4) using deceptive representations or designations of geographic origin in connection with goods or services;\n\n(5) representing that goods or services have sponsorship, approval, characteristics, ingredients, uses, benefits or quantities that they do not have or that a person has a sponsorship, approval, status, affiliation or connection that the person does not have;\n\n(6) representing that goods are original or new if they are deteriorated, altered, reconditioned, reclaimed, used or secondhand;\n\n(7) representing that goods or services are of a particular standard, quality or grade or that goods are of a particular style or model if they are of another;\n\n(8) disparaging the goods, services or business of another by false or misleading representations;\n\n(9) offering goods or services with intent not to supply them in the quantity requested by the prospective buyer to the extent of the stock available, unless the purchaser is purchasing for resale;\n\n(10) offering goods or services with intent not to supply reasonable expectable public demand;\n\n(11) making false or misleading statements of fact concerning the price of goods or services, the prices of competitors or one's own price at a past or future time or the reasons for, existence of or amounts of price reduction;\n\n(12) making false or misleading statements of fact for the purpose of obtaining appointments for the demonstration, exhibition or other sales presentation of goods or services;\n\n(13) packaging goods for sale in a container that bears a trademark or trade name identified with goods formerly packaged in the container, without authorization, unless the container is labeled or marked to disclaim a connection between the contents and the trademark or trade name;\n\n(14) using exaggeration, innuendo or ambiguity as to a material fact or failing to state a material fact if doing so deceives or tends to deceive;\n\n(15) stating that a transaction involves rights, remedies or obligations that it does not involve;\n\n(16) stating that services, replacements or repairs are needed if they are not needed;\n\n(17) failing to deliver the quality or quantity of goods or services contracted for;\n\n(18) violating the Tobacco Escrow Fund Act [6-4-14 to 6-4-24 NMSA 1978];

and\n\nE. \"unconscionable trade practice\" means an act or practice in connection with the sale, lease, rental or loan, or in connection with the offering for sale, lease, rental or loan, of any goods or services, including services provided by licensed professionals, or in the extension of credit or in the collection of debts that to a person's detriment:\n\n(1) takes advantage of the lack of knowledge, ability, experience or capacity of a person to a grossly unfair degree; or\n\n(2) results in a gross disparity between the value received by a person and the price paid.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 49-15-2, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 268, § 2; 1969, ch. 208, § 1; 1971, ch. 240, § 1; 1987, ch. 187, § 1; 1989, ch. 309, § 1; 1995, ch. 18, § 2; 1999, ch. 171, § 1; 2003, ch. 167, § 9; 2009, ch. 197, § 25; 2019, ch. 214, § 1.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective June 14, 2019, revised the definition of \"unfair or deceptive trade practice\" as used in the Unfair Practices Act, prohibited differential pricing or service based on the buyer's gender or perceived gender identity, and provided an exception; and added Paragraph D(19).\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, added Paragraph (18) of Subsection D.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, substituted \"means\" for \"includes\" near the beginning of Subsection A; inserted \"federal\" preceding \"Consumer Credit Protection\" in Paragraph B(2); in Subsection D, substituted \"an act specifically declared unlawful pursuant to the Unfair Practices Act, a\" for \"any\" preceding \"false or misleading\" and deleted \"but is not limited to\" at the end.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, inserted \"including services provided by licensed professionals\" in Subsection E.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, added \"unless the purchaser is purchasing for resale\" at the end of Subsection D(9).\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective June 16, 1989, added Subsection B and redesignated Subsections B through D as Subsections C through E.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, added \"but is not limited to\" at the end of the introductory paragraph of Subsection C and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to §§ 1 and 2 of the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\n\nPleading.— Section 57-12-2D NMSA 1978 does not set forth separate claims but rather sets forth a non-exhaustive list of conduct which might, independently, constitute a violation of the NMUPA.Guidance Endodontics LLC v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 728 F.Supp.2d 1170 (D.N.M. 2010).\n\nThe New Mexico lottery is not a person under the Unfair Practices Act, 57-12-1 NMSA 1978.Stansell v. N.M. Lottery, 2009-NMCA-062, 146 N.M. 417, 211 P.3d 214.\n\nA viable Unfair Practices Act claimneed not allege a direct representation by the defendant to the claimant or to the public, a commercial transaction between the claimant and the defendant, or detrimental reliance by the claimant on a deceptive statement by the defendant.Lohman v. Daimler-Chrysler Corp., 2007-NMCA-100, 142 N.M. 437, 166 P.3d 1091, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-005, 141 N.M. 762, 161 P.3d 259.\n\nPlaintiff did not prove a viable claim.— Where plaintiff asked defendant, who was an art appraiser, to determine whether the art owned by an estate was valuable; before viewing the art and after defendant explained the purpose of an appraisal and the fees associated with the process, it was apparent that plaintiff did not want to hire defendant to appraise the art, but wanted to dispose of the art; defendant purchased two paintings from plaintiff for $4,500, and later sold the paintings for $35,000 to an art dealer; the paintings were later sold to an art collector who sold the paintings at auction for $600,000; and plaintiff sued defendant for violation of the Unfair Practices Act, plaintiff did not prove a viable claim under the Unfair Practices Act because an essential element of a claim under the Unfair Practices Act that gives standing to a buyer is that a buyer purchase goods or services from a seller and plaintiff never acquired any goods or services from defendant.Hicks v. Eller, 2012-NMCA-061, 280 P.3d 304, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-005.\n\nStanding.— The Unfair Practices Act provides standing only to buyers of goods and services.Santa Fe Custom Shutters & Doors, Inc. v. Home Depot USA, Inc., 2005-NMCA-051, 137 N.M. 524, 113 P.3d 347, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-005, 137 N.M. 522, 113 P.3d 345.\n\nViolation of act not shown.— Defendant's Home Depot's activities in marketing plaintiff's shutters and installation services to defendant's own customers was not a sale of marketing services to plaintiff for purposes of Subsection D of this section.Santa Fe Custom Shutters & Doors, Inc. v. Home Depot USA, Inc., 2005-NMCA-051, 137 N.M. 524, 113 P.3d 347, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-005, 137 N.M. 522, 113 P.3d 345.\n\nA business has standing under the Unfair Practices Act to sue a competitor for misrepresentation.— A business has standing under the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act to sue a competitor for misrepresentations that damage the business by misleading or confusing the consuming public when the unfair practice occurs in connection with the sale of goods or services.First Nat'l Bancorp Inc. v. Alley, 76 F.Supp.3d 1261 (D.N.M. 2014).\n\nWhere it was alleged that defendants, an investment services firm, confused and misled former and potential customers of plaintiff, a competitor investment firm, by using a name confusingly similar to plaintiff's name, by creating a website that was confusingly similar to plaintiff's website, and by making misleading statements to plaintiff's existing or potential customers, denial of defendants' motion to dismiss was appropriate because plaintiff was likely to be damaged and may have suffered monetary losses due to defendants' misrepresentations.First Nat'l Bancorp Inc. v. Alley, 76 F.Supp.3d 1261 (D.N.M. 2014).\n\nKnowing and willful use of ambiguity as to material fact constituted an unfair or deceptive trade practice.— In a class action lawsuit, where individuals who purchased a Black & Decker coffeemaker at a New Mexico Wal-Mart store from 2009 to 2013 claimed that a trademark licensing agreement, whereby Applica Consumer Products, Inc. (Applica) paid royalties to Black & Decker in exchange for Applica's ability to use the Black & Decker name and trademarks in the sale of small kitchen appliances, including the coffeemaker at issue, but where there was no corporate affiliation between Black & Decker and Applica, and Black & Decker did not design, manufacture, distribute, or warrant the coffeemaker, was an unfair or deceptive trade practice, and where defendants argued that under the federal Lanham Act, the ultimate source or manufacturer of a product need not be identified by a brand name as long as the trademark owner exercises sufficient oversight over the nature and quality of the goods sold under its licensed mark and that if the Lanham Act allowed Applica to market the coffeemaker, the arrangement could not constitute a violation of the Unfair Practices Act (UPA), NMSA 1978, §§ 57-12-1 to -26, the district court did not err in concluding that Applica's use of the Black & Decker trademark on the coffeemaker constituted an unfair or deceptive trade practice, because the New Mexico legislature did not intend to require courts to apply Lanham Act precedent in deciding UPA claims, and the Black & Decker name on the product packaging would tend to deceive a reasonable consumer, and defendants should have known that potential purchasers of the coffeemaker would likely regard information about the coffeemaker being a Black & Decker product as material.Puma v. W-Mart Stores East, 2023-NMCA-005, cert. granted.\n\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order disgorgement of unjust gains for defendants' unfair trade practices.— In a class action lawsuit, where individuals who purchased a Black & Decker coffeemaker at a New Mexico Wal-Mart store from 2009 to 2013 claimed that a trademark licensing agreement, whereby Applica Consumer Products, Inc. (Applica) paid royalties to Black & Decker in exchange for Applica's ability to use the Black & Decker name and trademarks in the sale of small kitchen appliances, including the coffeemaker at issue, but where there was no corporate affiliation between Black & Decker and Applica, and Black & Decker did not design, manufacture, distribute, or warrant the coffeemaker, was an unfair or deceptive trade practice, and where defendants argued that under the federal Lanham Act, the ultimate source or manufacturer of a product need not be identified by a brand name as long as the trademark owner exercises sufficient oversight over the nature and quality of the goods sold under its licensed mark and that if the Lanham Act allowed Applica to market the coffeemaker, the arrangement could not constitute a violation of the Unfair Practices Act (UPA), NMSA 1978, §§ 57-12-1 to -26, and where the district court concluded that Applica's use of the Black & Decker trademark on the coffeemaker constituted an unfair or deceptive trade practice, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order disgorgement of unjust gains for defendants' unfair trade practices, because Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of producing evidence permitting at least a reasonable approximation of the amount of the wrongful gain.Puma v. W-Mart Stores East, 2023-NMCA-005, cert. granted.\n\nMany factors figure into issue of materiality.Smoot v. Physicians Life Ins. Co., 2004-NMCA-027, 135 N.M. 265, 87 P.3d 545.\n\nUnfair Practices Act imposes duty to disclose material factsreasonably necessary to prevent any statements from being misleading.Smoot v. Physicians Life Ins. Co., 2004-NMCA-027, 135 N.M. 265, 87 P.3d 545.\n\nExistence of duty is dependent on materialityof the facts.Smoot v. Physicians Life Ins. Co., 2004-NMCA-027, 135 N.M. 265, 87 P.3d 545.\n\nDegree of deception required.— Subsection D(14) of this section does not require that the defendant's conduct actually deceive a consumer; it permits recovery even if the conduct only tends to deceive.Smoot v. Physicians Life Ins. Co., 2004-NMCA-027, 135 N.M. 265, 87 P.3d 545.\n\nIntentional and unintentional statements.— This article applies to all misleading or deceptive statements, whether intentionally or unintentionally made.Ashlock v. Sunwest Bank, 1988-NMSC-026, 107 N.M. 100, 753 P.2d 346,overruled on other grounds byGonzales v. Surgidev Corp., 1995-NMSC-036, 120 N.M. 133, 899 P.2d 576.\n\nIntent to deceive not element of \"unfair or deceptive trade practice\"but a knowing representation is required.Richardson Ford Sales, Inc. v. Johnson, 1984-NMCA-007, 100 N.M. 779, 676 P.2d 1344.\n\nWhen a debt collection agency knowingly sent letters to the plaintiff containing deceptive representations, whether or not the agency intended to deceive the plaintiff was irrelevant.Russey v. Rankin, 911 F. Supp. 1449 (D.N.M. 1995).\n\nAn attorney who, by the practice and procedure of collection he employed in his dealings with a debt collection agency, knowingly effectuated the sending of letters containing deceptive representations, and thus violated the Unfair Trade Practices Act.Russey v. Rankin, 911 F. Supp. 1449 (D.N.M. 1995).\n\nThe \"knowingly made\" requirementis met if a party was actually aware that the statement was false or misleading when made, or in the exercise of reasonable due diligence should have been aware that the statement was false or misleading.Stevenson v. Louis Dreyfus Corp., 1991-NMSC-051, 112 N.M. 97, 811 P.2d 1308.\n\nThe \"knowingly made\" requirementin Subsection D is met if a party was actually aware that the statement was false or misleading when made or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have been aware that the statement was false or misleading.Russey v. Rankin, 911 F. Supp. 1449 (D.N.M. 1995).\n\nPlaintiff did not establish a violation of the Unfair Practices Act where no proof was offered that defendant knew that misrepresentations as to insurance coverage were false or misleading.Teague-Strebeck Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Ins. Co., 1999-NMCA-109, 127 N.M. 603, 985 P.2d 1183, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 391, 981 P.2d 1209.\n\nA claim under this act was supported by evidence that defendant insurer knew that the rates were inadequate prior to the time the agreement went into effect and did not disclose its method for deciding whether to add a surcharge to the preliminary premium or increase annual rates, and that plaintiff would not have contracted with defendant if it had that information.Woodworker's Supply, Inc. v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 170 F.3d 985 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\nInsufficient evidence of unfair trade practices.— In an action for breach of contract, where plaintiff hired defendant to design and construct a replacement irrigation well on plaintiff's property, and although a written contract was not executed, plaintiff's understanding of the agreement, as told to him by defendant, was that defendant would construct a well that would be fully adequate for plaintiff's irrigation purposes, that it would be capable of producing 2,500 to 3,000 gallons of water per minute, and that it would last at least fifty years, and where, after three-and-a-half years, the well stopped working, the district court did not err in denying plaintiff's claim for unfair trade practices, because, although plaintiff established that defendant made false or misleading misrepresentations, there was no evidence that the false or misleading representations were knowingly made.Robey v. Parnell, 2017-NMCA-038.\n\nInsufficient evidence of unconscionable trade practices.— In an action for breach of contract, where plaintiff hired defendant to design and construct a replacement irrigation well on plaintiff's property, and although a written contract was not executed, plaintiff's understanding of the agreement, as told to him by defendant, was that defendant would construct a well that would be fully adequate for plaintiff's irrigation purposes, that it would be capable of producing 2,500 to 3,000 gallons of water per minute, and that it would last at least fifty years, and where, after three-and-a-half years, the well stopped working, the district court did not err in denying plaintiff's claim for unconscionable trade practices, because plaintiff did not meet his burden of providing evidence that the value received was grossly disproportionate to the price paid, other than arguing that he received less than 10 percent of the longevity he was promised.Robey v. Parnell, 2017-NMCA-038.\n\nJury instruction as to knowing misrepresentation.— Jury instruction stating that plaintiff had the burden of proving that defendant had knowingly made misrepresentations, including failing to deliver the quantity of goods and services contracted for, while inartfully drafted, accurately stated the law; it did not equate simple breach of contract with knowing misrepresentation, but required plaintiff to establish a knowing misrepresentation by defendant in relation to the goods and services contracted for.Diversey Corp. v. Chem-Source Corp., 1998-NMCA-112, 125 N.M. 748, 965 P.2d 332.\n\nRefusal to acknowledge liability.— Bank's refusal to acknowledge liability, pursuant to the \"FTC Holder Rule\", on a contract for a mobile home assigned to it from the original seller was an unfair practice under Subsection D(15).Jaramillo v. Gonzales, 2002-NMCA-072, 132 N.M. 459, 50 P.3d 554, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 288, 47 P.3d 447.\n\nSingle or multiple instances.— This article makes no distinction between single or multiple instances of prohibited conduct.Ashlock v. Sunwest Bank, 1988-NMSC-026, 107 N.M. 100, 753 P.2d 346,overruled on other grounds byGonzales v. Surgidev Corp., 1995-NMSC-036, 120 N.M. 133, 899 P.2d 576.\n\nThe Unfair Trade Practices Act does not require a showing of multiple violations.Hale v. Basin Motor Co., 1990-NMSC-068, 110 N.M. 314, 795 P.2d 1006.\n\nFailure to deliver contracted services.— Where a bank advertised through the mail and in the newspapers that it would provide an interest-bearing account, the advertisements were representations knowingly made by the bank in connection with the offering of a service, as a direct result of the advertising and of subsequent discussions with a bank employee, the plaintiff transferred monies into an account for the express purpose of earning such interest, and the plaintiff sued because of the bank's failure to pay interest as advertised and as was indicated to him by the bank when his funds were transferred, since the entire series of acts clearly occurred in the regular course of the bank's business, the bank's refusal to remedy the situation patently resulted in its failure to deliver the quality of services contracted for, contrary to Subsection D(17).Ashlock v. Sunwest Bank, 1988-NMSC-026, 107 N.M. 100, 753 P.2d 346,overruled on other grounds byGonzales v. Surgidev Corp., 1995-NMSC-036, 120 N.M. 133, 899 P.2d 576.\n\nFailure to defend or indemnify in qui tam actions.— Claims under the Unfair Practices Act failed where defendant insurance companies had no duty to defend nor indemnify plaintiff against a qui tam action that the federal government brought, and plaintiff did not allege any facts tending to show that defendants knowingly misled it or made any false statement.New Mem. Assocs. v. Credit Gen. Ins. Corp., 973 F. Supp. 1027 (D.N.M. 1997).\n\n\"New demonstrator\" is not deceptive.— Car dealer's statement that a vehicle was a \"new demonstrator\" was not intended to suggest that the vehicle was unused or \"new,\" and therefore did not violate the Unfair Trade Practices Act.Hale v. Basin Motor Co., 1990-NMSC-068, 110 N.M. 314, 795 P.2d 1006.\n\nClaim of unconscionable trade practice requires some duty of defendant.— Even if Unfair Practices Act applies to insurance companies, insured failed to present evidence to support claim that failure to explain policy to insured constituted unconscionable trade practice where insured had duty to read and familiarize himself with the policy and insurer had no duty to explain that insured was not covered while driving girlfriend's car.State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Price, 1984-NMCA-036, 101 N.M. 438, 684 P.2d 524, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 362, 683 P.2d 44,overruled on other grounds byEllingwood v. N.N. Investors Life Ins. Co., 1991-NMSC-006, 111 N.M. 301, 805 P.2d 70.\n\nAllegations sufficient to go forward.— Allegations that a bank engaged in an unconscionable trade practice by taking advantage of the defendants' lack of ability and capacity due to their advancing age, by charging excessive overdraft fees, by misrepresenting the nature of an advance note, by allegedly thwarting the defendants' attempt at obtaining financing elsewhere, and by attempting foreclosure on the defendants' ranch were sufficient to go forward on defendants' broad counterclaim of unconscionable trade practices.Portales Nat'l Bank v. Ribble, 2003-NMCA-093, 134 N.M. 238, 75 P.3d 838.\n\nNegligent failure to obtain insurance coverage.— The claim of negligent failure to obtain insurance coverage presupposes that there was no coverage. Since the jury determined that the property was in fact covered, the claim of negligent failure to obtain coverage fails.Paiz v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 1994-NMSC-079, 118 N.M. 203, 880 P.2d 300.\n\nAbuse by counselor did not create claim under this act.— In an action against a hospital for damages sustained as the result of a sexual assault by a counselor, where plaintiff failed to show that the hospital's advertising was false or misleading in connection with the sale of its goods and services, she failed to establish a claim under the Unfair Practices Act.Eckhardt v. Charter Hosp., 1998-NMCA-017, 124 N.M. 549, 953 P.2d 722.\n\nBecause alleged misrepresentations are unconnected to good or service,the claim does not fall within the parameters of the Unfair Practices Act.Eden v. Voss, 105 Fed. Appx. 234 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\nSale of completed house is not sale of goods or servicesfor purposes of Subsection D of this section.McElhannon v. Ford, 2003-NMCA-091, 134 N.M. 124, 73 P.3d 827.\n\nConstruction services rendered prior to completion of a residential home are \"any services\" as defined in this section.— In a dispute between parties to a contract for the construction of a new home, where construction company, after experiencing financial difficulties, ceased operations and failed to construct and deliver the home to plaintiffs, the district court erred in dismissing as a matter of law plaintiff's claim for unfair trade practices, because in the absence of language expressly including or excluding construction services, construction services rendered prior to the completion of a residential home are \"any services\" as defined in this section.Fogelson v. Wallace, 2017-NMCA-089, cert. granted.\n\nRoyalties.— The payment of royalties, including any associated deductions for post-production oil and gas costs, is not connected to goods and services but to realty, and claim alleging underpayment of royalties does not fall within the ambit of the Unfair Practices Act.Elliott Indus. Ltd. P'ship v. BP Am. Prod. Co., 407 F.3d 1091 (10th Cir. 2005).\n\nErroneous financial advice.— Where defendant provided financial services to plaintiff, which included management of plaintiff's securities account; at defendant's recommendation, plaintiff purchased a deferred variable annuity; defendant subsequently erroneously advised plaintiff that plaintiff could withdraw money from the annuity to purchase an office building without incurring any tax liability; plaintiff withdrew the money from the annuity; the IRS determined that the withdrawal was subject to income tax, increased plaintiff's tax liability by the amount withdrawn, and assessed additional taxes, interest and penalties; and plaintiff would not have withdrawn money from the annuity but for defendant's misrepresentation that the withdrawal would be tax free, defendant's erroneous advise was given in connection with the sale of financial services to plaintiff and was subject to the Uniform Practices Act.Maese v. Garrett, 2014-NMCA-072, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-006.\n\nEvidence of good faith.— The mere fact of a bad result and breach of warranty by a defendant contracted to perform repairs did not require a finding that the defendant acted in violation of this article, where the defendant acted in good faith and there was substantial evidence that the defendant did not knowingly make any false or misleading statement or other misrepresentation of any kind.Hubbard v. Albuquerque Truck Ctr. Ltd., 1998-NMCA-058, 125 N.M. 153, 958 P.2d 111.\n\nViolation of act shown.— Substantial evidence existed of violations of this act, where the aggrieved party testified that the signature on a construction contract was not his own, and the jury was allowed to compare it to authentic samples of his signature, and where testimony was given that the contractor billed for material used on other construction projects, that the invoices were illegible and that other problems existed. The fact that any errors in the billings may have been unintentional does not remove the conduct from the prohibitions of this act.Page & Wirtz Constr. Co. v. Solomon, 1990-NMSC-063, 110 N.M. 206, 794 P.2d 349.\n\nSignature loans were substantively and procedurally unconscionable.— Where defendants marketed and originated unsecured signature loans of between $50 and $300 to the working poor who provided proof of steady employment but who were either unbanked or underbanked and who were significantly less-educated than the general population and financially unsophisticated individuals; the loans carried APRs of between 1,147.14 and 1,500 percent and were payable in biweekly installments over a year; defendants exploited the borrower's disadvantage by describing loans in terms of a misleading daily rate, advertising loans for 50 percent off when the discount was the interest on the first installment on the loan, encouraged borrowers to increase the principal of their loans or to take out another loan, withheld amortization schedules from customers which revealed that the loans were interest-only loans for extended periods of time, and leveraged borrowers' cognitive and behavioral weakness that caused borrowers to focus in the promise of quick cash rather than on the long-term costs of the loans and the borrowers' ability to repay the loans; and the terms of defendants' loan contracts were non-negotiable, the loans were substantively and procedurally unconscionable under the common law and violated the Unfair Practices Act.State ex rel. King v. B&B; Inv. Grp. Inc., 2014-NMSC-024.\n\nViolation of act not shown.— Granting of the company's counterclaim for malicious abuse of process was proper in part pursuant to where the district court could have found that the builder lacked a reasonable basis for believing that the company made a knowing misrepresentation about the deposit because the company merely offered the builder the option of receiving either a partial cash refund, less the cost of the time-study door, or the full amount in store credit.Dawley v. La Puerta Architectural Antiques, Inc., 2003-NMCA-029, 133 N.M. 389, 62 P.3d 1271.\n\nPlaintiff failed to plausibly state a claim under the NMUPA.— Where plaintiff, an eye surgery center that reduced its operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, brought an action against defendant, an insurance company that issued to plaintiff a commercial property policy, for violation of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act, §§ 57-12-1 to -26 NMSA 1978, alleging that defendant used ambiguity as to the offered coverage, offered, and charged a premium for, first-party all-risk insurance coverage, and then denied coverage, and withheld coverage on a basis it failed to disclose to plaintiff, the claim was dismissed, because plaintiff's complaint did not identify which statement or statements at issue were false or misleading, failed to allege facts in its complaint to show that any misrepresentation tended to deceive or mislead any person, and failed to allege facts to show that such defendant's conduct occurred in the regular course of defendant's business. A complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements necessary to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.Albuquerque Ambulatory Eye Surgery Ctr. LLC v. Transportation Ins. Co., 566 F. Supp.3d 1178 (D. N.M. 2021)\n\nSummary judgment proper.— In an action alleging unconscionable trade practices, summary judgment upheld where plaintiff failed to meet his burden to rebut bank's prima facie evidence that the overdraft fee was not grossly disproportionate to the value received.Hernandez v. Wells Fargo Bank New Mexico, 2006-NMCA-018, 139 N.M. 68, 128 P.3d 496.\n\nAct not in conflict with federal law.— The Unfair Practices Act (this article) and federal legislation are not in conflict, and 15 U.S.C. § 57b (e) has not preempted the New Mexico act.Ashlock v. Sunwest Bank, 1988-NMSC-026, 107 N.M. 100, 753 P.2d 346,overruled on other grounds byGonzales v. Surgidev Corp., 1995-NMSC-036, 120 N.M. 133, 899 P.2d 576.\n\nFederal court definitions inapplicable to terms defined in this section.— Since this section defines both \"unfair or deceptive\" and \"unconscionable\" trade practices, relying on 57-12-4 NMSA 1978 to apply federal court definitions of those terms would not be giving effect to the statute.Richardson Ford Sales, Inc. v. Johnson, 1984-NMCA-007, 100 N.M. 779, 676 P.2d 1344.\n\nClaim preempted by federal law.— Plaintiff's action seeking to prevent defendants from selling furniture \"deceptively similar\" to that of the plaintiff did not involve a state claim of unfair competition, where the protection plaintiff sought was protection against copying designs and his claim was therefore preempted by federal law.Ernest Thompson Fine Furniture Maker, Inc. v. Youart, 1990-NMCA-012, 109 N.M. 572, 787 P.2d 1255.\n\nNonunique items must be offered in amounts related to demand.— Pursuant to Subsection D(10), nonunique items or commodities must be offered in supplies to satisfy reasonably expected public demand, and of course, the test for determining the expected public demand is subjective and would depend on variable factors concerning the type of sale and the commodity involved. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-123.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Consumer Class Actions Under the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act,\" see 4 N.M.L.

Bronstein, 39 B.R. 20 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1984).\n\nThree essential elements of a claim under the Unfair Practices Act.— A successful plaintiff must prove (1) the defendant made an oral or written statement, a visual description or a representation of any kind that was either false or misleading; (2) the false or misleading representation was knowingly made in connection with the sale, lease, rental, or loan of goods or services in the regular course of the defendant's business; and (3) the representation was of the type that may, tends to, or does deceive or mislead any person.Dollens v. Wells Fargo Bank, 2015-NMCA-096.\n\nWhere defendant bank, as the agent of its borrower and as the licensed agency representing an insurance company in the sale of mortgage accidental death insurance policies for which it is a policyholder and beneficiary, knowingly created the perception that it would have a system in place or take some active role in the claims process to protect decedent's family's financial security in the event of an accidental death, decedent's family had a reasonable expectation that defendant bank would honor a request of the insurer, whose policy it sold, not to foreclose on decedent's house while a claim is pending or to otherwise credit back to the account any fees that were incurred while the insurer processed the claim. Where defendant bank failed to challenge evidence that it created a reasonable expectation that it would communicate and work together with the insurance company to prevent foreclosure during a pending accidental death claim, the district court did not err in finding a violation of the Unfair Practices Act.Dollens v. Wells Fargo Bank, 2015-NMCA-096.\n\nInsufficient evidence of unfair trade practices.— In an action for breach of contract, where plaintiff hired defendant to design and construct a replacement irrigation well on plaintiff's property, and although a written contract was not executed, plaintiff's understanding of the agreement, as told to him by defendant, was that defendant would construct a well that would be fully adequate for plaintiff's irrigation purposes, that it would be capable of producing 2,500 to 3,000 gallons of water per minute, and that it would last at least fifty years, and where, after three-and-a-half years, the well stopped working, the district court did not err in denying plaintiff's claim for unfair trade practices, because, although plaintiff established that defendant made false or misleading misrepresentations, there was no evidence that the false or misleading representations were knowingly made.Robey v. Parnell, 2017-NMCA-038.\n\nInsufficient evidence of unconscionable trade practices.— In an action for breach of contract, where plaintiff hired defendant to design and construct a replacement irrigation well on plaintiff's property, and although a written contract was not executed, plaintiff's understanding of the agreement, as told to him by defendant, was that defendant would construct a well that would be fully adequate for plaintiff's irrigation purposes, that it would be capable of producing 2,500 to 3,000 gallons of water per minute, and that it would last at least fifty years, and where, after three-and-a-half years, the well stopped working, the district court did not err in denying plaintiff's claim for unconscionable trade practices, because plaintiff did not meet his burden of providing evidence that the value received was grossly disproportionate to the price paid, other than arguing that he received less than 10 percent of the longevity he was promised.Robey v. Parnell, 2017-NMCA-038.\n\nEstablishing an unfair or deceptive practice by misrepresentation.— To establish an unfair or deceptive trade practice by misrepresentation, a plaintiff must show that defendant made a false statement, the defendant made the statement in connection with the sale of services and knew that the statement was false, the defendant made the statement in the regular course of trade or commerce, and the statement was one which may, tends to, or does deceive or mislead any person.OR&L Const. v. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co., 2022-NMCA-035.\n\nWhere plaintiff, a construction business that conducts, among other things, roof repair, including \"torch-down\" roofing, a technique which uses a flaming torch to heat and seal tar paper onto a roof, purchased a general commercial liability insurance policy through an insurance broker, who was authorized to sell insurance products supplied by defendant, an insurance company, and where defendant transmitted to the broker a copy of the insurance policy, which specifically precluded coverage for damages caused by torch-down roofing, and where plaintiff, unaware of the exclusion, submitted a claim for coverage after a fire occurred at a home while plaintiff was performing torch-down roofing, and where defendant denied plaintiff's insurance claim relying on the torch-down roofing exclusion, and where plaintiff claimed that defendant made several material misrepresentations, the district court did not err in denying plaintiff's claim, because defendant failed to point to anywhere in the record demonstrating that defendant made any false statements or material misrepresentations. Defendant was entitled to rely on the torch-down roofing exclusion because the plaintiff had notice of the exclusion as a matter of law.OR&L Const. v. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co., 2022-NMCA-035.\n\nSummary judgment was proper where plaintiff's claim was not connected to any goods or services she purchased.— Where in 2010, defendants began manufacturing and selling several products, including magnets, flasks, and cards, bearing plaintiff's image with the caption, \"I'm going to be the most popular girl in rehab!\", and where in 2014, plaintiff filed an action under the Unfair Practices Act (UPA), §§ 57-12-1 through § 57-12-26 NMSA 1978, the district court did not err in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment because the UPA gives standing only to buyers of goods or services, and plaintiff failed to demonstrate how her claim, which is not connected to any goods or services she purchased, falls with the purview of the UPA.Vigil v. Taintor, 2020-NMCA-037, cert. denied.\n\nCar dealer's representationthat car was a demonstrator and failure to disclose prior ownership that car was actually a rental car states a claim under the Unfair Practices Act, the Motor Vehicle Dealers Franchise Act and for common law fraud.Salmeron v. Highlands Ford Sales, Inc., 271 F. Supp. 2d 1314 (D.N.M. 2003).\n\nA buyer-seller relationship is ordinarily not fiduciary in nature.— Where plaintiff, a grower and harvester of chile peppers, and defendant, a dehydration chile plant that purchases, processes, and dehydrates different varieties of chile, entered into a contract where plaintiff would deliver raw chile peppers to defendant, which would then wash, dehydrate, weigh and pay for the chile, and where plaintiff filed a lawsuit against defendant when there was a dispute as to how much chile was delivered and how much was paid for, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to defendant on plaintiff's claim that defendant breached its fiduciary duty, because an essential feature and consequence of a fiduciary relationship is that the fiduciary becomes bound to act in the interests of its beneficiary and not itself, and this dynamic does not inhere in the ordinary buyer-seller relationship.Valerio v. San Mateo Enterprises, Inc., 2017-NMCA-059.\n\nKnowing and willful use of ambiguity as to material fact constituted an unfair or deceptive trade practice.— In a class action lawsuit, where individuals who purchased a Black & Decker coffeemaker at a New Mexico Wal-Mart store from 2009 to 2013 claimed that a trademark licensing agreement, whereby Applica Consumer Products, Inc. (Applica) paid royalties to Black & Decker in exchange for Applica's ability to use the Black & Decker name and trademarks in the sale of small kitchen appliances, including the coffeemaker at issue, but where there was no corporate affiliation between Black & Decker and Applica, and Black & Decker did not design, manufacture, distribute, or warrant the coffeemaker, was an unfair or deceptive trade practice, and where defendants argued that under the federal Lanham Act, the ultimate source or manufacturer of a product need not be identified by a brand name as long as the trademark owner exercises sufficient oversight over the nature and quality of the goods sold under its licensed mark and that if the Lanham Act allowed Applica to market the coffeemaker, the arrangement could not constitute a violation of the Unfair Practices Act (UPA), 57-12-1 to 57-12-26 NMSA 1978, the district court did not err in concluding that Applica's use of the Black & Decker trademark on the coffeemaker constituted an unfair or deceptive trade practice, because the New Mexico legislature did not intend to require courts to apply Lanham Act precedent in deciding UPA claims, and the Black & Decker name on the product packaging would tend to deceive a reasonable consumer, and defendants should have known that potential purchasers of the coffeemaker would likely regard information about the coffeemaker being a Black & Decker product as material.Puma v. W-Mart Stores East, 2023-NMCA-005, cert. granted.\n\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order disgorgement of unjust gains for defendants' unfair trade practices.— In a class action lawsuit, where individuals who purchased a Black & Decker coffeemaker at a New Mexico Wal-Mart store from 2009 to 2013 claimed that a trademark licensing agreement, whereby Applica Consumer Products, Inc. (Applica) paid royalties to Black & Decker in exchange for Applica's ability to use the Black & Decker name and trademarks in the sale of small kitchen appliances, including the coffeemaker at issue, but where there was no corporate affiliation between Black & Decker and Applica, and Black & Decker did not design, manufacture, distribute, or warrant the coffeemaker, was an unfair or deceptive trade practice, and where defendants argued that under the federal Lanham Act, the ultimate source or manufacturer of a product need not be identified by a brand name as long as the trademark owner exercises sufficient oversight over the nature and quality of the goods sold under its licensed mark and that if the Lanham Act allowed Applica to market the coffeemaker, the arrangement could not constitute a violation of the Unfair Practices Act (UPA), 57-12-1 to 57-12-26 NMSA 1978, and where the district court concluded that Applica's use of the Black & Decker trademark on the coffeemaker constituted an unfair or deceptive trade practice, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order disgorgement of unjust gains for defendants' unfair trade practices, because Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of producing evidence permitting at least a reasonable approximation of the amount of the wrongful gain.Puma v. W-Mart Stores East, 2023-NMCA-005, cert. granted.\n\nDescriptors on cigarette label were deceptive to a reasonable consumer.— Where consumers brought consolidated actions against a cigarette manufacturer alleging that the manufacturer's labeling of its cigarettes as natural, organic, and additive-free deceived them into believing that the cigarettes were safer and healthier than other cigarettes, and where defendant claimed that a disclaimer on the label of the cigarette package expressly stated that the lack of additives does not mean a safer cigarette, the natural and organic descriptors were found to be deceptive to a reasonable consumer, because the disclaimer was limited to the lack of additives, but said nothing about natural or organic which are descriptors that convey a message that the cigarettes are less harmful than other cigarettes.In re Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co. Mktg. & Sales, 288 F.Supp.3d 1087 (2017).\n\nWrongful conduct rule barred unfair trade practices claim.— Where plaintiffs brought an action against defendant pharmacist who allegedly filled prescriptions for plaintiffs for improper and dangerous amounts of opioids and other controlled substances, asserting claims for unfair, deceptive, and unconscionable trade practices in violation of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act (NMUPA), 57-12-1 to 57-12-26 NMSA 1978, and where plaintiffs admitted in court pleadings that they worked in concert with a nurse practitioner to present fraudulent prescriptions to defendant's pharmacy and to share those drugs with the nurse practitioner, plaintiffs were barred from asserting their claims because they are based on plaintiffs' own illegal conduct, acquiring narcotics through fraudulent prescriptions. Claims under the NMUPA may be dismissed under the wrongful conduct rule if the plaintiff's conduct is prohibited under a criminal statute, there is a sufficient causal nexus between the plaintiff's illegal conduct and plaintiff's damages, and the defendant's culpability is not greater than the plaintiff's.Inge v. McClelland, 257 F.Supp.3d 1158 (D. N.M. 2017).\n\nTransportation motor carriers may bring a competitive injury claim under the Unfair Practices Act.— Where taxi company brought a diversity action against defendant, a ride-share service, on the theory that the ride-share service should have, but did not, comply with the New Mexico Motor Carrier Act (MCA), §§ 65-2A-1 through 65-2A-41 NMSA 1978, when it first entered the city market, and where defendant moved to dismiss, arguing that New Mexico law bars plaintiff from pursuing a cause of action for competitive injury damages under the Unfair Practices Act (UPA), §§ 57-12-1 through 57-12-26 NMSA 1978, the district court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, because the UPA generally precludes companies from asserting a cause of action against their competitors, but the legislature carved out an exception to the UPA's general prohibition of competitive injury lawsuits. The plain language of § 65-2A-33(J) of the MCA demonstrates that the legislature intended to allow an authorized transportation service carrier to sue a transportation services carrier who operates without authorization.Albuquerque Cab Co., Inc. v.

The willful misrepresentation of the age or condition of a motor vehicle by any person, including regrooving tires or performing chassis repair, without informing the purchaser of the vehicle that the regrooving or chassis repair has been performed, is an unlawful practice within the meaning of the Unfair Practices Act, unless the alleged misrepresentation is based wholly on repair of damage, the disclosure of which was not required pursuant to Subsection C of this section. The failure to provide an affidavit pursuant to Subsection B of this section when there has been repair for which disclosure is required shall constitute prima facie evidence of willful misrepresentation.\n\nB. Except as provided in Subsections C and D of this section, a seller of a motor vehicle shall furnish at the time of sale of a motor vehicle an affidavit that:\n\n(1) describes the vehicle; and\n\n(2) states to the best of the seller's knowledge whether there has been an alteration or chassis repair due to wreck damage.\n\nC. No affidavit shall be required pursuant to this section if the flat rate manual cost of the alteration or chassis repair is less than six percent of the sales price of the vehicle.\n\nD. In the case of a private-party sale of a vehicle, an affidavit shall be furnished only upon the request of the purchasing party.\n\nE. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection D of Section 57-12-10 NMSA 1978, the award of three times actual damages as provided for in that section shall be in lieu of any award of punitive damages based only on those facts constituting the unfair or deceptive trade practice or unconscionable trade practice.\n\nF. Any person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 49-15-5.1(B), enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 274, § 1, and recompiled as 1953 Comp., § 49-15-5.1 by Laws 1977, ch. 181, § 4; 1981, ch. 361, § 1; 1991, ch. 232, § 1; 1995, ch. 10, § 1.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, substituted \"Subsections C and D of this section\" for \"this subsection\" in the introductory paragraph of Subsection B; in Subsection C, substituted the language beginning \"the flat rate manual\" for \"the vehicle is a new vehicle and the cost of the alteration or chassis repair is less than three hundred dollars ($300)\" and deleted the former second sentence, defining \"new vehicle\"; and deleted \"to another private party\" following \"vehicle\" and \"private\" following \"purchasing\" in Subsection D.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, in Subsection A, added the language beginning with \"unless the alleged misrepresentation\" at the end of the first sentence and added the second sentence; added Subsections C and E; redesignated Subsection C as Subsection D and Subsection D as Subsection F; and made a minor stylistic change in Subsection B.\n\n\"Altered\" construed.— Within the context of Subsection B, goods are \"altered\" if, as measured against the reasonable expectations of the consumer, the characteristics or value of the motor vehicle are affected in a meaningful way.Hale v. Basin Motor Co., 1990-NMSC-068, 110 N.M. 314, 795 P.2d 1006.\n\n\"Due to wreck damage\" construed.— The phrase \"due to wreck damage\" in Subsection B(2) modifies only \"chassis repair\" and not \"alteration.\"Hale v. Basin Motor Co., 1990-NMSC-068, 110 N.M. 314, 795 P.2d 1006.\n\nAlteration found.— Evidence showing that right front fender was replaced, right door frame was straightened, holes were drilled in the door panel to pull out a dent, sheet metal in the damaged area was ground down and resurfaced with body filler, and the damaged area was repainted was sufficient to support finding that vehicle was altered within the meaning of Subsection B.Hale v. Basin Motor Co., 1990-NMSC-068, 110 N.M. 314, 795 P.2d 1006.\n\nArbitration agreement that barred punitive damages did not constitute an unconscionable contract term.— Where plaintiff purchased a 2018 chevrolet vehicle from defendants, and in the process of purchasing the vehicle, plaintiff signed an order agreement and bill of sale, which contained an arbitration provision and a damages limitation provision stating that the dealer was not liable for punitive damages arising out of the sale or use of the vehicle, and where plaintiff filed a complaint in district court, alleging that in the process of purchasing the vehicle, the dealership failed to accurately convey the car's prior damage in order to sell a defective product, and where defendants moved to compel arbitration under the agreement, and where plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the arbitration agreement should not be enforced because the contract was unconscionable, primarily because the punitive damages limitation provision restricts access to statutorily mandated treble damages under the Unfair Practice Act provided by the legislature, the district court did not err in its determination that the contract and the arbitration provision must be enforced, because although the damages provision was facially one-sided in that it disclaimed any punitive damages against the car dealer only, the contract was not unconscionable because the only damages the provision at issue excluded were common law punitive damages not granted by the legislature, leaving the statutory treble damages available to plaintiff.Rojas v.

      "text": "Nothing in the Unfair Practices Act shall apply to actions or transactions expressly permitted under laws administered by a regulatory body of New Mexico or the United States, but all actions or transactions forbidden by the regulatory body, and about which the regulatory body remains silent, are subject to the Unfair Practices Act.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 49-15-6, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 268, § 6; 1999, ch. 171, § 2.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, added the language beginning \"but all\" to the end.\n\nActions of a regulatory agency.— The plain language of the statute indicates that the phrase \"actions or transactions expressly permitted under laws administered by a regulatory body\" is not limited to formal regulations promulgated by an agency. Based on the language of 57-12-7 NMSA 1978 and the New Mexico cases interpreting the statutory exemption, an agency can administer laws expressly permitting an action or transaction through ways other than formal regulation. Plaintiffs' UPA claim asserting that defendant used the term \"lights\" or \"lowered tar and nicotine\" on Marlboro Lights or Cambridge Lights cigarette packages without disclosing the tar and nicotine content of the cigarettes according to FTC testing method on the cigarette packages violates the UPA is not barred by implied conflict preemption principles because the evidence before the court was that it would not be \"impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements\" and a finding that the use of descriptors on the cigarette packages without supporting numerical tar and nicotine disclosures on the packages is deceptive would not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.Mulford v. Altria Group, Inc., 506 F. Supp. 2d 733 (D.N.M. 2007).\n\nRegulatory defense.— Although it is true that the insurance division does administer the regulatory laws governing the issuance of insurance policies in New Mexico, the insurance division has never specifically addressed the subject of modal premiums, and both the Insurance Code and the regulations are silent on the subject. Thus, an insurance company's non-disclosure of certain information regarding its modal premium practices is not \"expressly permitted\" by the insurance division. Accordingly, the regulatory defense set forth in 57-12-7 NMSA 1978 that would exclude transactions expressly permitted under New Mexico regulatory law does not apply.Azar v. Prudential Ins.Co. of Am., 2003-NMCA-062, 133 N.M. 669, 68 P.3d 909.\n\nExpress permission is required to create an exemption.— To exempt an activity or a transaction from the coverage of the Unfair Practices Act, an agency must expressly, and not implicitly, permit the specific activity or transaction, including the manner in which the activity or transaction is done.Quynh Truong v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2010-NMSC-009, 147 N.M. 583, 227 P.3d 73,rev'g2008-NMCA-051, 143 N.M. 831, 182 P.3d 814.\n\nNotice of exemption.— For an action or a transaction to be deemed expressly permitted and thereby exempted from the coverage of the Unfair Practices Act, the permission must be within the authority of the regulatory body to grant and must be specifically articulated in a public document.Quynh Truong v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2010-NMSC-009, 147 N.M. 583, 227 P.3d 73,rev'g2008-NMCA-051, 143 N.M. 831, 182 P.3d 814.\n\nAn express exemption of certain actions or transactions from the coverage of the Unfair Practices Act does not apply retroactively.Quynh Truong v. Allstate Ins.

Allstate Ins. Co., 2010-NMSC-009, 147 N.M. 583, 227 P.3d 73,rev'g2008-NMCA-051, 143 N.M. 831, 182 P.3d 814.\n\nUse of a computer program to evaluate insurance claims was not expressly permitted.— Where plaintiffs alleged that the insurer violated the Unfair Practices Act by using claims processing computer programs that were programmed to underestimate and underpay plaintiffs' insurance claims below their true value; the superintendent of insurance adopted an independent market conduct examination that randomly sampled and noted no objections to the insurer's general claims handling practices within the historical period in which plaintiffs' claims had arisen; the market conduct examination did not make any conclusions about the design or manner of use of the insurer's claims processing computer programs; and the market conduct examination and the superintendent's order did not mention the computer programs or any express grant of permission to use the computer programs, the use of the insurer's computer programs was not expressly permitted by the superintendent of insurance and was not exempt from the coverage of the Unfair Practices Act.Quynh Truong v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2010-NMSC-009, 147 N.M. 583, 227 P.3d 73,rev'g2008-NMCA-051, 143 N.M. 831, 182 P.3d 814.\n\nThis section requiresthat actions be expressly permitted by a regulatory body.Summit Prop., Inc. v.

At a minimum, the regulatory body must actually administer the regulatory laws with respect to the party claiming the exemption, thereby exercising at least the modicum of oversight that the exempting language indicates is required. In effect, this means the regulatory body must render permission to engage in the business of the transaction through licensing, registration or some similar manifestation of \"permitting\" the business activity.State ex rel.

The court shall award attorney fees and costs to the party charged with an unfair or deceptive trade practice or an unconscionable trade practice if it finds that the party complaining of such trade practice brought an action that was groundless.\n\nD. The relief provided in this section is in addition to remedies otherwise available against the same conduct under the common law or other statutes of this state.\n\nE. In any class action filed under this section, the court may award damages to the named plaintiffs as provided in Subsection B of this section and may award members of the class such actual damages as were suffered by each member of the class as a result of the unlawful method, act or practice.\n\nF. A party to a court action for a private remedy pursuant to this section may request in writing during the thirty-day period following service of the summons and complaint on all parties named in the action that the parties attempt to settle the claim in early mediation. If a request for mediation is made, the parties shall choose a mutually acceptable mediator and enter into mediation within sixty days of the appointment of an acceptable mediator unless otherwise agreed by the parties. A request for mediation may be rescinded at any time if agreed to by all parties.\n\nG. If the parties do not agree on a mutually acceptable mediator, the court shall appoint the mediator. If the early mediation pursuant to this section is entered into within sixty days following the appointment of the mediator, the parties suing on the basis of unfair, deceptive or unconscionable trade practices or acts under the Unfair Practices Act shall be required to pay no more than fifty dollars ($50.00) toward the cost of the mediation and the other party shall pay the remainder of such cost, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. If a person is seeking injunctive relief in accordance with Subsection A of this section, the person may pursue the claim for injunctive relief without following the mediation requirements of this subsection and Subsection F of this section.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 49-15-8, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 268, § 8; 1971, ch. 240, § 4; 1977, ch. 181, § 3; 1987, ch. 187, § 2; 2005, ch. 187, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 3 of the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added Subsection F to provide that a party to a court action for a private remedy may request mediation of the claim and that if a request for mediation is made, the parties shall select an acceptable mediator and that a request for mediation may be rescinded if the parties agree; added Subsection G to provide that if the parties do not agree upon a mediator, the court shall appoint a mediator, that if mediation is entered into within 60 days after appointment of a mediator, the party suing shall be required to pay not more than $50 of the cost of mediation and that a person seeking injunctive relief may pursue the claim for injunctive relief without following the mediation requirements.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, added the second sentence of Subsection B and rewrote Subsection C.\n\nAttorney fees.— Where plaintiff was successful on certain claims brought against defendant, but was not successful on an Unfair Trade Practices Act claim; the court ruled that defendant was only entitled to attorney fees incurred in defending the Unfair Trade Practices Act claim; and defendant did not identify what portion of defendants' attorney fees were attributable to defending the Unfair Trade Practices Act or demonstrate that it was difficult or impossible to segregate the work in defending the Unfair Trade Practices Act claim from plaintiff's other claims, the court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that defendant was not entitled to any attorney fees.Dean v. Brizuela, 2010-NMCA-076, 148 N.M. 548, 238 P.3d 917.\n\nAward of attorney fees permitted on successful claims only.— In a class action lawsuit, where individuals who purchased a Black & Decker coffeemaker at a New Mexico Wal-Mart store from 2009 to 2013 claimed that a trademark licensing agreement, whereby Applica Consumer Products, Inc. (Applica) paid royalties to Black & Decker in exchange for Applica's ability to use the Black & Decker name and trademarks in the sale of small kitchen appliances, including the coffeemaker at issue, but where there was no corporate affiliation between Black & Decker and Applica, and where Black & Decker did not design, manufacture, distribute, or warrant the coffeemaker, was an unfair or deceptive trade practice, and where defendants argued that federal permitted such trademark agreements and therefore allowed Applica to market the coffeemaker under the Black & Decker trademark, and where the district court concluded that Applica's use of the Black & Decker trademark on the coffeemaker constituted an unfair or deceptive trade practice and that the named plaintiffs were entitled to statutory damages, but the class was not entitled to damages because it could not establish actual damages, the district court did not abuse its discretion in its award of attorney fees to the named plaintiffs regarding the UPA claim, but the court abused its discretion in its award of attorney fees related to class certification because the class was not a successful party.Puma v. W-Mart Stores East, 2023-NMCA-005, cert. granted.\n\nA viable Unfair Practices Act claimneed not allege actual monetary or property loss.Lohman v. Daimler-Chrysler Corp., 2007-NMCA-100, 142 N.M. 437, 166 P.3d 1091, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-005, 141 N.M. 762, 161 P.3d 259.\n\nThe Unfair Practices Act does not provide a cause of action for competitive injury claims.— Where plaintiff, a company that provides railway construction and repair services to BNSF railway company, sued plaintiff's business competitor in district court raising several claims, including an Unfair Practices Act (UPA) claim, alleging that the competitor operated its business without satisfying the mandatory licensing requirements, and sought damages under the UPA on a theory that had the competitor disclosed its licensure status, BNSF would have awarded to plaintiff contracts that were awarded to its competitor, plaintiff did not have a cause of action under the UPA, because the history of the UPA indicates that the legislature intended to limit the zone of interest protected from unfair trade practices by the UPA to consumers, not competitors.GandyDancer, LLC v. Rock House CGM, LLC, 2019-NMSC-021,rev'g2018-NMCA-064, 429 P.3d 338.\n\nBusiness's standing to bring a private right of action against competitor.— A business may have a private right of action against a business competitor under the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act provided that the conduct alleged involves trade practices that either implicate consumer protection concerns or are addressed to the market generally.Gandydancer, LLC v. Rock House CGM, LLC, 2018-NMCA-064, cert. granted.\n\nWhere plaintiff, a construction company that provides railroad contracting services to BNSF railway company (BNSF), submitted a complaint to the New Mexico construction industries division, alleging defendant, a competing construction company, had performed unlicensed construction work in violation of the Construction Industries Licensing Act, and where plaintiff sued defendant in district court raising several claims, including an Unfair Practices Act (UPA) claim, alleging that defendant operated its business without satisfying the mandatory licensing requirements, induced plaintiff's former employees to divulge confidential trade secrets, and used those trade secrets to convince BNSF to hire defendant instead of plaintiff without disclosing to BNSF that it was unlicensed, the district court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of standing, because the conduct alleged in plaintiff's complaint involved trade practices addressed to the market generally or otherwise implicated consumer protection concerns.Gandydancer, LLC v. Rock House CGM, LLC, 2018-NMCA-064, cert. granted.\n\nAppellate attorney fees.— A plaintiff who prevails on appeal of an action brought under the Unfair Practices Act is entitled to an award of appellate attorney fees under 57-12-19C NMSA 1978. An award of fees on appeal furthers the public policies of encouraging individuals to pursue their Unfair Practices Act claims and reimbursing plaintiffs and their counsel for enforcing the Unfair Practices Act.Aguilera v. Palm Harbor Homes, Inc., 2004-NMCA-120, 136 N.M. 422, 99 P.3d 672, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-010, 136 N.M. 541, 101 P.3d 807.\n\nClass actions.— Because 57-10-12 NMSA 1978 provides that a successful private plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees and costs; may recover the greater of actual damages or statutory damages even if proof of damages or loss or intent to deceive or take unfair advantage of a person cannot established; may recover the greater of treble actual or statutory damages upon a showing that the deceptive or unconscionable trade practice is willful; and are entitled to collect more than their actual damages as opposed to members who sue as a class, a private plaintiff has a individual remedy under 57-10-12 NMSA 1978 that is superior to the remedy the plaintiff would have as a member of a class action and is grounds for the denial of a class certification under Rule 1-023(B)(3) NMRA.Brooks v. Norwest Corp., 2004-NMCA-134, 136 N.M. 599, 103 P.3d 39, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-012, 136 N.M. 665, 103 P.3d 1097.\n\nReliance on deceptive conduct.— Consistent with a national trend to interpret consumer protection statutes, like the Unfair Practices Act, such that plaintiffs need not prove reliance, and consistent with the absence of language in the act requiring reliance, a plaintiff need not allege or prove that she relied on defendant's purported deceptive conduct in order to recover under the Act.Smoot v. Physicians Life Ins. Co.,, 2004-NMCA-027, 135 N.M. 265, 87 P.3d 545.\n\nProof of link required.— While it is true that the Unfair Practices Act requires proof of a casual link between conduct and loss, there is nothing in the language of the act requiring proof of a link between conduct and purchase or sale.Smoot v. Physicians Life Ins. Co.,2004-NMCA-027, 135 N.M. 265, 87 P.3d 545.\n\nPrevailing party on some, but not all claims.— Where plaintiff sued defendant for several claims, including tortious interference with prospective contractual relations and violation of the New Mexico Unfair Trade Practices Act; the trial court dismissed most of plaintiff's claims and directed a verdict against plaintiff on the tortious interference claim; and a jury awarded plaintiff damages on the UTPA claim, plaintiff was a prevailing party and was entitled to attorney's fees and costs.Knight v. Snap-On Tools Corp., 3 F.3d 1398 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nWhere plaintiff prevailed on one, but not all of plaintiff's claims under the New Mexico Unfair Trade Practices Act, defendant was not entitled to attorney's fees and costs.Knight v. Snap-On Tools Corp., 3 F.3d 1398 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nFailure to file answer bringing partial directed verdict.— In a civil suit by the state under the Pyramid or Multilevel Sales Act and the Unfair Practices Act, defendant's right to trial by jury was not infringed upon by the trial court's granting of a partial directed verdict against him on the issue of liability and the court's rejection of requested jury instructions, including requested special interrogatories to the jury, where defendant failed to file an answer to the complaint filed by the state, but only filed a document entitled \"Declaration of Status\", and challenged the jurisdiction of the court and the constitutionality of the Pyramid or Multilevel Sales Act (now Pyramid Promotional Schemes Act, 57-13-1 et seq.).State ex rel. Stratton v. Sinks, 1987-NMCA-092, 106 N.M. 213, 741 P.2d 435.\n\nActual damages required.— To obtain financial recovery under the Unfair Practices Act, the deceptive trade practice must have caused plaintiffs to suffer actual damages.Chavarria v. Fleetwood Retail Corp., 2005-NMCA-082, 137 N.M. 783, 115 P.3d 799,rev'd on other grounds,Chavarria v. Fleetwood Retail Corp., 2006-NMSC-046, 140 N.M. 478, 143 P.3d 717.\n\nFailure to deliver mobile home with custom features.— Award of Unfair Practices Act damages for defendant's failure to deliver a mobile home with certain custom features ordered by plaintiffs are damages that appear to relate to promises made by defendant during the sale itself and thus are properly awarded under the UPA.Chavarria v. Fleetwood Retail Corp., 2005-NMCA-082, 137 N.M. 783, 115 P.3d 799,rev'd on other grounds,Chavarria v. Fleetwood Retail Corp., 2006-NMSC-046, 140 N.M. 478, 143 P.3d 717.\n\nFailure to prove \"loss of money or property\".— Where the aggrieved party did not produce evidence of loss of money or property as a result of a contractor's forgery of a construction contract and overbilling, recovery was limited to $300.Page & Wirtz Constr. Co. v. Solomon, 1990-NMSC-063, 110 N.M. 206, 794 P.2d 349.\n\nRecovery of cost of repair or diminished value.— Car buyers who claimed recovery for the cost of repairs were limited to only recovering the cost of such repairs ($840) even though the difference between the fair market value of the vehicle before and after the damage took place was $1,000, because a party may recover only the smaller of these items.Hale v. Basin Motor Co., 1990-NMSC-068, 110 N.M. 314, 795 P.2d 1006.\n\nMeasure of damages for erroneous financial advice.— The proper measure of damages in cases where negligent financial or tax advise has led a plaintiff to incur additional tax liability is the difference between what the plaintiff would have owed absent the negligence and what the plaintiff paid because of the negligence, plus incidental damages.Maese v. Garrett, 2014-NMCA-072, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-006.\n\nRecovery of damages due to erroneous financial advice.— Where defendant provided financial services to plaintiff, which included management of plaintiff's securities account; at defendant's recommendation, plaintiff purchased a deferred variable annuity; defendant subsequently erroneously advised plaintiff that plaintiff could withdraw money from the annuity to purchase of an office building without incurring any tax liability; plaintiff withdrew the money from the annuity; the IRS determined that the withdrawal was subject to income tax, increased plaintiff's tax liability by the amount withdrawn, and assessed $77,623 in additional taxes, interest and penalties; and plaintiff would not have withdrawn money from the annuity but for defendant's misrepresentation that the withdrawal would be tax free, plaintiff suffered a compensable loss and the district court's damages award to plaintiff in the amount of $77,623 was correct.Maese v. Garrett, 2014-NMCA-072, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-006.\n\nRecovery limited absent actual losses.— In the absence of actual losses, plaintiff was still entitled to recover the statutory damages of $100; he was only required to put on evidence of his actual damages as it pertained to recovery of actual damages.Jones v. GMC, 1998-NMCA-020, 124 N.M. 606, 953 P.2d 1104.\n\nFederal diversity jurisdiction.— In unfair trade practices action, federal court did not err in assuming diversity jurisdiction based on amount in controversy of $50,000, where treble damages sought were $41,028.51 and the plaintiff sought reasonable attorney's fees and costs.Miera v. Dairyland Ins. Co., 143 F.3d 1337 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\nIn an action involving Unfair Practices Act claims proceeding in a federal court pursuant to its diversity jurisdiction, the potential award under this section of attorney fees and treble damages, in addition to compensatory damages, should be considered in determining whether the plaintiff satisfies the jurisdictional amount-in-controversy requirement.Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Soc'y v. Manganaro, 342 F.3d 1213 (10th Cir. 2003).\n\nTriple damages.— The permissive language of Subsection B leads to the conclusion that it was within the legislature's contemplation that in some cases, but not all, the false or misleading statement would be made at the outset with the intent to deceive, and in such cases triple damages would not be unwarranted. Conversely, it suggests also that the legislature anticipated other situations wherein the statement would not be intentionally unfair or deceptive, but could become a false or misleading representation at some time during the life of the transaction.Ashlock v. Sunwest Bank, 1988-NMSC-026, 107 N.M. 100, 753 P.2d 346,overruled on other grounds by Gonzales v. Surgidev Corp., 1995-NMSC-036, 120 N.M. 133, 899 P.2d 576.\n\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in denying treble damages based on its findings regarding the record in the case and other remedies awarded.Woodworker's Supply, Inc. v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 170 F.3d 985 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\nWillfully defined.— The legislature contemplated proof of some culpable mental state to demonstrate \"willfully\", as set forth in Subsection B of 57-12-8 NMSA 1978; willful conduct is the intentional doing of an act with knowledge that harm may result.Atherton v. Gopin, 2015-NMCA-003, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-012.\n\nMeaning of \"groundless\" claim.— In enacting Subsection C, the legislature intended the term \"groundless\" to have the same meaning as \"frivolous\" as used in Rule 16-301 NMRA. The rule provides in applicable part that \"[a] lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\"G.E.W. Mech. Contractors v. Johnston Co., 1993-NMCA-081, 115 N.M. 727, 858 P.2d 103.\n\nThe simple fact that the defendant prevailed on an unfair practices claim does not establish that the claim is groundless; rather, the defendant must show that there is no arguable basis in law or fact to support the cause of action and the claim is not supported by a good-faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.Marchman v. NCNB Tex. Nat'l. Bank, 1995-NMSC-041, 120 N.M. 74, 898 P.2d 709.\n\nDismissal of the plaintiffs' claims on the grounds of forum non conveniens did not reflect on the merits of the claims and could not be construed as a ruling that the claims were groundless.Marchman v. NCNB Tex. Nat'l. Bank, 1995-NMSC-041, 120 N.M. 74, 898 P.2d 709.\n\nDefendant not entitled to attorney fees merely for prevailing against plaintiff's claims.— In an action for breach of contract and unfair trade practices, where plaintiff hired defendant to design and construct a replacement irrigation well on plaintiff's property, and although a written contract was not executed, plaintiff's understanding of the agreement, as told to him by defendant, was that defendant would construct a well that would be fully adequate for plaintiff's irrigation purposes, that it would be capable of producing 2,500 to 3,000 gallons of water per minute, and that it would last at least fifty years, and where, after three-and-a-half years, the well stopped working, the district court did not err in denying defendant's request for attorney fees even though defendant prevailed on plaintiff's unfair practices claim, because plaintiff's claim was not groundless and there was nothing in the record to support defendant's conclusory assertion that plaintiff failed to make a proper argument.Robey v. Parnell, 2017-NMCA-038.\n\nAward of punitive damages not excessive.— Because the ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages awarded was smaller than the statutory ratio in Subsection B of this section for similar conduct, the award of punitive damages was not excessive.Bogle v. Summit Inv. Co., 2005-NMCA-024, 137 N.M. 80, 107 P.3d 520.\n\nRestitution is an appropriate remedy for unconscionable loans.— Where defendants marketed and originated signature loans that carried the substantively unconscionable and invalid APRs of between 1,147.14 and 1,500 percent, the proper remedy was to strike the unconscionable interest term, enforce the remainder of the loan contracts without the unconscionable term, apply the statutory default interest rate of 15 percent simple interest pursuant to 56-8-3 NMSA 1978, and require defendants to refund all money collected on the loans in excess of 15 percent of the principal as restitution for their unconscionable trade practices.State ex rel. King v. B&B Inv. Grp. Inc., 2014-NMSC-024.\n\nAward of attorney fees.— To be entitled to attorneys fees, it is not enough to show that the plaintiff did not prevail on such claims. The defending party must also establish that, at the time such claim was filed, the claim was initiated in bad faith or there was no credible evidence to support it.Jones v. Beavers, 1993-NMCA-100, 116 N.M. 634, 866 P.2d 362, cert. denied, 116 N.M. 290, 861 P.2d 971.\n\nEven though plaintiff elected not to recover on his claim under the Unfair Practices Act, but chose to recover damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, he was entitled to an award of attorney's fees under Subsection C.Garcia v. Coffman, 1997-NMCA-092, 124 N.M. 12, 946 P.2d 216, cert. denied, 123 N.M. 626, 944 P.2d 274.\n\nAn award of attorneys' fees and costs is not limited to a specific percentage of recovery and includes attorneys' fees and costs on appeal.Jones v. GMC, 1998-NMCA-020, 124 N.M. 606, 953 P.2d 1104.\n\nAttorney's fees properly awarded to a defendant even though the plaintiff withdrew an unfair practices claim prior to trial, where the plaintiff failed to use the appropriate language in its motion to have the claim dismissed and there was confusion as to whether that was the plaintiff's intent.Buckingham v. Ryan, 1998-NMCA-012, 124 N.M. 498, 953 P.2d 33.\n\nRequirement in Subsection C of this section regarding attorneys' fees applies to fees on appeal as well as fees at the district court level.Aguilera v. Palm Harbor Homes, Inc., 2004-NMCA-120, 136 N.M. 422, 99 P.3d 672, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-010, 136 N.M. 541, 101 P.3d 807.\n\nSubsection C of this section allows the award of attorney fees in Unfair Practices Act cases, and Rule 12-403 NMRA simply provides a procedure for requesting the appellate portion of those allowable fees.Aguilera v. Palm Harbor Homes, Inc., 2004-NMCA-120, 136 N.M. 422, 99 P.3d 672, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-010, 136 N.M. 541, 101 P.3d 807.\n\nAward of fees and costs.— Where plaintiff, a construction business that conducts, among other things, roof repair, including \"torch-down\" roofing, a technique which uses a flaming torch to heat and seal tar paper onto a roof, purchased a general commercial liability insurance policy through an insurance broker, who was authorized to sell insurance products supplied by defendant, an insurance company, and where defendant transmitted to the broker a copy of the insurance policy, which specifically precluded coverage for damages caused by torch-down roofing, and where plaintiff, unaware of the exclusion, submitted a claim for coverage after a fire occurred at a home while plaintiff was performing torch-down roofing, and where defendant denied plaintiff's insurance claim relying on the torch-down roofing exclusion, and where the district court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that plaintiff had reasonable notice of the torch-down roofing exclusion as a matter of law and awarded costs to defendant, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding costs and fees where it affirmatively explained, in a detailed twelve-page order, its reasons for awarding fees and costs in a manner that was not contrary to logic or reason.OR&L Const. v. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co., 2022-NMCA-035.\n\nPrevailing parties are entitled to award of reasonable attorney fees.— Where tenants brought action against apartment owner and manager for violations of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act (UPA), §§ 57-12-1 through § 57-12-26 NMSA 1978, and the New Mexico Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act (UORRA), §§ 47-8-1 through § 47-8-52 NMSA 1978, and where the parties reached a settlement agreement on all issues except attorney fees, plaintiffs were entitled to reasonable attorney fees, notwithstanding the fact that the damage award was small, because plaintiffs successfully prosecuted their UPA and UORRA claims; the amount involved and the results obtained are only one factor among several the court may consider to determine a reasonable attorney fee.Fallen v. GREP Southwest, LLC, 247 F.Supp.3d 1165 (2017).\n\nMultiplier applied to a lodestar attorney fee.— To the extent a lodestar value does not take into account the factors that justify a multiplier, the district court has discretion to apply a multiplier factor to a lodestar fee awarded in an action under the Unfair Practices Act, 57-12-1 et seq. NMSA 1978.Atherton v. Gopin, 2012-NMCA-023, 272 P.3d 700.\n\nWhere plaintiff recovered $5,200.00 plus attorney fees in an action under the Unfair Practices Act, 57-12-1 et seq. NMSA 1978; plaintiff calculated attorney fees of $35,759.10; and the court awarded plaintiff attorney fees of $39,608.40 based on the lodestar method, the court had discretion to apply a multiplier factor to the lodestar fee to the extent a lodestar value did not take into account the factors that justify a multiplier.Atherton v. Gopin, 2012-NMCA-023, 272 P.3d 700.\n\nAppellate fees recoverable.— Subsection C does not by its own terms limit itself to fees and costs incurred at the trial court level. The award of attorney fees and costs on appeal is entirely consistent with the statutory purpose of creating a private remedy to redress wrongs resulting from unfair or deceptive trade practices.Hale v. Basin Motor Co., 1990-NMSC-068, 110 N.M. 314, 795 P.2d 1006.\n\nThe district court has the authority to award attorney fees on appeal even if an arbitration panel lacked the authority to do so.Aguilera v. Palm Harbor Homes, Inc., 2004-NMCA-120, 136 N.M. 422, 99 P.3d 672, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-010, 136 N.M. 541, 101 P.3d 807.\n\nAn award of fees on appeal furthers the public policies of encouraging individuals to pursue their Unfair Practices Act claims and reimbursing plaintiffs and their counsel for enforcing the Unfair Practices Act.Aguilera v. Palm Harbor Homes, Inc., 2004-NMCA-120, 136 N.M. 422, 99 P.3d 672, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-010, 136 N.M. 541, 101 P.3d 807.\n\nTreble damages and punitive damages exclusive.— Recovery of both statutory treble damages and punitive damages based upon the same conduct would be improper. In Subsection D, the legislature created a new statutory remedy in addition to those otherwise available, but did not suggest that a party would be entitled to multiple awards of damages arising out of the same conduct.Hale v. Basin Motor Co., 1990-NMSC-068, 110 N.M. 314, 795 P.2d 1006.\n\nThe Unfair Practices Act does not permit a jury to award punitive damages; it only permits a judge to award up to treble damages for a willful violation of the Act.McLelland v. United Wis. Life Ins. Co., 1999-NMCA-055, 127 N.M. 303, 980 P.2d 86, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 389, 981 P.2d 1207.\n\nProvision in arbitration agreement that barred punitive damages, but did not bar statutory treble damages, did not constitute an unconscionable contract term.— Where plaintiff purchased a 2018 chevrolet vehicle from defendants, and in the process of purchasing the vehicle, plaintiff signed an order agreement and bill of sale, which contained an arbitration provision and a damages limitation provision stating that the dealer was not liable for punitive damages arising out of the sale or use of the vehicle, and where plaintiff filed a complaint in district court, alleging that in the process of purchasing the vehicle, the dealership failed to accurately convey the car's prior damage in order to sell a defective product, and where defendants moved to compel arbitration under the agreement, and where plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the arbitration agreement should not be enforced because the contract was unconscionable, primarily because the punitive damages limitation provision restricts access to statutorily mandated treble damages under the Unfair Practice Act provided by the legislature, the district court did not err in its determination that the contract and the arbitration provision must be enforced, because although the damages provision was facially one-sided in that it disclaimed any punitive damages against the car dealer only, the contract was not unconscionable because the only damages the provision at issue excluded were common law punitive damages not granted by the legislature, leaving the statutory treble damages available to plaintiff.Rojas v. Reliable Chevrolet (NM), LLC, 2024-NMCA-003.\n\nArbitration clause barred.— Regulation mandating arbitration clause in title insurance contract is in conflict with 59A-16-30 NMSA 1978 and this section; therefore, plaintiff in suit against title company may have statutory claims heard in a court of law.Lisanti v.

Whenever the attorney general has reason to believe that any person may be in possession, custody or control of an original or copy of any book, record, report, memorandum, paper, communication, tabulation, map, chart, photograph, mechanical transcription or other tangible document or recording which he believes to be relevant to the subject matter of an investigation of a probable violation of the Unfair Practices Act, he may, prior to the institution of a civil proceeding, execute in writing and cause to be served upon the person a civil investigative demand requiring such person to produce documentary material and permit the inspection and copying of the material. The demand of the attorney general shall not be a matter of public record and shall not be published by him except by order of the court.\n\nB. Each demand shall:\n\n(1) state the general subject matter of the investigation;\n\n(2) describe the classes of documentary material to be produced with reasonable certainty;\n\n(3) prescribe the return date within which the documentary material is to be produced, which in no case shall be less than ten days after the date of service; and\n\n(4) identify the members of the attorney general's staff to whom such documentary material is to be made available for inspection and copying.\n\nC. No demand shall:\n\n(1) contain any requirement which would be unreasonable or improper if contained in a subpoena duces tecum issued by a court of this state; or\n\n(2) require the disclosure of any documentary material which would be privileged, or which for any other reason would not be required by a subpoena duces tecum issued by a court of this state;\n\n(3) require the removal of any documentary material from the custody of the person upon whom the demand is served except in accordance with the provisions of Subsection E.\n\nD. Service of the demand may be made by:\n\n(1) delivering a duly executed copy thereof to the person to be served, or if the person is not a natural person, to the statutory agent for the person or to any officer of the person to be served; or\n\n(2) delivering a duly executed copy thereof to the principal place of business in this state of the person to be served; or\n\n(3) mailing by registered or certified mail a duly executed copy of the demand addressed to the person to be served at his principal place of business in this state, or, if the person has no place of business in this state, to his principal office or place of business.\n\nE. Documentary material demanded pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be produced for inspection and copying during normal business hours at the principal office or place of business of the person served or may be inspected and copied at such other times and places as may be agreed upon by the person served and the attorney general.\n\nF. No documentary material produced pursuant to a demand, or copies thereof, shall, unless otherwise ordered by the district court in the county in which the person resides or has his principal place of business, or is about to [perform] or is performing the practice which is alleged to be unlawful under the Unfair Practices Act, for good cause shown, be produced for inspection or copying by anyone other than an authorized employee of the attorney general, nor shall the contents thereof be disclosed to anyone other than an authorized employee of the attorney general, or in court in an action relating to a violation of the Unfair Practices Act.\n\nG. At any time before the return date of the demand, a petition to set aside the demand, modify the demand or extend the return date thereon may be filed in the district court in the county in which the person resides or has his principal place of business, or is about to [perform] or is performing the practice which is alleged to be unlawful under the Unfair Practices Act, and the court upon a showing of good cause may set aside the demand, modify it or extend the return date of the demand.\n\nH. After service of the investigative demand upon him, if any person neglects or refuses to comply with the demand, the attorney general may invoke the aid of the court in the enforcement of the demand. In appropriate cases the court shall issue its order requiring the person to appear and produce the documentary material required in the demand and may upon failure of the person to comply with the order punish the person for contempt.\n\nI.

A dealer is prohibited from using the term \"documentary fee\" for \"charges other than those actually required by law for processing of documents.\" It does not include fees for document preparation, which may be assessed as a component of dealer transfer service fees.

The issuance of the writ requires that there be a threatened departure of the defendant or removal of property from the jurisdiction and a resulting defeat of the court's power to give effective in personam relief due to its loss of control over the defendant's person or property. In the absence of a threat to abscond, the writ may not be used as a form of coercing payment of a debt, no matter how just, nor as a form of punishment, no matter how deserved. Once the purposes of the writ and conditions of the bond have been fulfilled, the writ and the bond are discharged. Failure to comply with the conditions of a ne exeat bond results in forfeiture of the bond.Atherton v. Gopin, 2015-NMCA-087.\n\nThe writ of ne exeat is collateral to an Unfair Practices Act judgment.— Issuance of the writ does not depend on an actual violation of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act, 57-12-1 NMSA 1978 et seq. (UPA). This section permits the issuance of a writ of ne exeat when the attorney general has a reasonable belief that any person is using or is about to use any method, act or practice which is declared by the UPA to be unlawful and reasonable belief that any such person is about to remove himself from the state, or is about to remove his property or assets from the state. The writ is a means to effectuate a remedy for UPA violations by keeping a party within the jurisdiction of the court, but it is not itself a remedy, and it is necessarily collateral to any UPA judgment that may be entered.Atherton v. Gopin, 2015-NMCA-087.\n\nFollowing entry of summary judgment for over $2,500,000 against defendant for violations of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act, 57-12-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., the district court issued a writ of ne exeat and ordered defendant to post a ne exeat bond in the amount of $100,000 based on evidence that defendant was about to remove assets from the jurisdiction of the district court, and following a hearing where the district court found that there was evidence that defendant had engaged in complex financial transactions for the purpose of preventing collection of the judgment, that defendant had dissipated assets during the pendency of the case, including the sale of property, and that defendant, who failed to appear at the hearing, had previously testified under oath that he would attend all future hearings in the case and would not flee the jurisdiction, the district court increased the ne exeat bond to $500,000 to prevent further dissipation of assets within the jurisdiction of the court and to secure defendant's appearance at future proceedings. Based on the collateral nature of the writ of ne exeat, the modification of the ne exeat bond order was within the district court's jurisdiction to enforce its judgment in the underlying case notwithstanding the appeal of that judgment.Atherton v. Gopin, 2015-NMCA-087.\n\nNe exeat bond amount.— A ne exeat bond amount is within the district court's discretion, but the bond amount may not be excessive or oppressive.Atherton v. Gopin, 2015-NMCA-087.\n\nFollowing entry of summary judgment for over $2,500,000 against defendant for violations of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act, 57-12-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., the district court issued a writ of ne exeat and ordered defendant to post a ne exeat bond in the amount of $100,000 based on evidence that defendant was about to remove assets from the jurisdiction of the district court, and following a hearing where the district court found that there was evidence that defendant had engaged in complex financial transactions for the purpose of preventing collection of the judgment, that defendant had dissipated assets during the pendency of the case, including the sale of property, and that defendant, who failed to appear at the hearing, had previously testified under oath that he would attend all future hearings in the case and would not flee the jurisdiction, the district court increased the ne exeat bond to $500,000 to prevent further dissipation of assets within the jurisdiction of the court and to secure defendant's appearance at future proceedings. The district court did not abuse its discretion in setting the bond amount where the total bond amount, including the increase, was well under the total amount of the judgment of approximately $2.5 million, and where defendant did not argue on appeal that the bond amount was excessive or oppressive.Atherton v. Gopin, 2015-NMCA-087.\n\nSufficient evidence to support district court's decision to increase ne exeat bond amount.— Following entry of summary judgment for over $2,500,000 against defendant for violations of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act, 57-12-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., the district court issued a writ of ne exeat and ordered defendant to post a ne exeat bond in the amount of $100,000 based on evidence that defendant was about to remove assets from the jurisdiction of the district court, and following a hearing where the district court found that there was evidence that defendant had engaged in complex financial transactions for the purpose of preventing collection of the judgment, that defendant had dissipated assets during the pendency of the case, including the sale of property, and that defendant, who failed to appear at the hearing, had previously testified under oath that he would attend all future hearings in the case and would not flee the jurisdiction, the district court increased the ne exeat bond to $500,000 to prevent further dissipation of assets within the jurisdiction of the court and to secure defendant's appearance at future proceedings. Where evidence established that defendant owned certain real property, that he entered into a real estate contract for sale of the property and transferred his interest in the property to his wife just days before judgment was entered in the underlying case, the district court could reasonably find that the sale and transfer of the property constituted dissipation of assets. There was sufficient evidence to support the district court's decision to increase the ne exeat bond.Atherton v. Gopin, 2015-NMCA-087.\n\nDue process required during hearing on motion for writ of ne exeat.— Due process is required during a hearing on a motion for writ of ne exeat, and is provided when a defendant has timely notice, a reasonable opportunity to be heard, a reasonable opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses and present evidence, representation by counsel, and a hearing before an impartial decisionmaker.Atherton v. Gopin, 2015-NMCA-087.\n\nFollowing entry of summary judgment for over $2,500,000 against defendant for violations of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act, 57-12-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., the district court issued a writ of ne exeat and ordered defendant to post a ne exeat bond in the amount of $100,000 based on evidence that defendant was about to remove assets from the jurisdiction of the district court, and following a hearing where the district court found that there was evidence that defendant had engaged in complex financial transactions for the purpose of preventing collection of the judgment, that defendant had dissipated assets during the pendency of the case, including the sale of property, and that defendant, who failed to appear at the hearing, had previously testified under oath that he would attend all future hearings in the case and would not flee the jurisdiction, the district court increased the ne exeat bond to $500,000 to prevent further dissipation of assets within the jurisdiction of the court and to secure defendant's appearance at future proceedings. Defendant's right to due process of law was not violated where defendant filed a response in opposition to the motion for writ of ne exeat, in which he disputed that he was dissipating assets from the state, where defendant had notice of and was present and represented by counsel at the hearing on the initial motion, where there was no indication in the record that defendant was denied the opportunity to present witnesses at the hearing, and where defendant submitted exhibits for the district court's review.Atherton v.

Historically, where the removal of property would defeat the purpose of a ne exeat writ, the order in the writ may detain property as well as the person. At common law, a ne exeat writ, including a bond, may be conditioned on preservation of assets. This section does not prohibit bonds related to assets or property. Therefore, since the statute is silent as to these bonds, the statute does not abrogate the common law.Atherton v. Gopin, 2015-NMCA-087.\n\nFollowing entry of summary judgment for over $2,500,000 against defendant for violations of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act (UPA), 57-12-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., the district court issued a writ of ne exeat and ordered defendant to post a ne exeat bond in the amount of $100,000 based on evidence that defendant was about to remove assets from the jurisdiction of the district court, and following a hearing where the district court found that there was evidence that defendant had engaged in complex financial transactions for the purpose of preventing collection of the judgment, that defendant had dissipated assets during the pendency of the case, including the sale of property, and that defendant, who failed to appear at the hearing, had previously testified under oath that he would attend all future hearings in the case and would not flee the jurisdiction, the district court increased the ne exeat bond to $500,000 to prevent further dissipation of assets within the jurisdiction of the court and to secure defendant's appearance at future proceedings. Issuance of the bond order conditioned on preservation of assets was not contrary to the UPA, because the UPA does not abrogate the common law, which permitted a ne exeat bond to be conditioned on preservation of assets.Atherton v.

A door-to-door sale includes seller initiated telephone sales. A door-to-door sale does not include a transaction:\n\n(a) made pursuant to prior negotiations in the course of a visit by the buyer to a retail business establishment having a fixed permanent location where the goods are exhibited or the services are offered for sale on a continuing basis;\n\n(b) in which the consumer is accorded the right of rescission by the provisions of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. 1635, or regulations issued pursuant thereto;\n\n(c) in which the buyer has initiated the contract and the goods or services are needed to meet a bona fide immediate personal emergency of the buyer, and the buyer furnishes the seller with a separate dated and signed personal statement in the buyer's handwriting describing the situation requiring immediate remedy and expressly acknowledging and waiving the right to cancel the sale within three business days;\n\n(d) in which the buyer has initiated the contract and specifically requested the seller to visit the buyer's home for the purpose of repairing or performing maintenance upon the buyer's personal property. If in the course of such a visit the seller sells the buyer the right to receive additional services or goods other than replacement parts necessarily used in performing the maintenance or in making the repairs, the sale of those additional goods or services would not fall within this exclusion;\n\n(e) pertaining to the sale or rental of real property, to the sale of insurance or to the sale of securities or commodities by a broker-dealer registered with the securities and exchange commission; or\n\n(f) in which a consumer acquires the use of goods under the terms of a rental-purchase agreement made pursuant to the provisions of the Rental-Purchase Agreement Act, with an initial rental period of one week or less, by placing a telephone call to a lessor and by requesting that specific goods be delivered to the consumer's residence or such other place as the consumer directs and consummation of the rental-purchase agreement occurs after the goods are delivered;\n\n(4) \"place of business\" means the main or permanent branch office or local address of a seller;\n\n(5) \"purchase price\" means the total price paid or to be paid for the consumer goods or services, including all interest and service charges; and\n\n(6) \"seller\" means any person, partnership, corporation or association engaged in the door-to-door sale of consumer goods or services.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 57-12-21, enacted by Laws 1987, ch. 212, § 1; 1995, ch. 38, § 13; 2019, ch. 123, § 2.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective July 1, 2019, replaced Washington's birthday with President's day and Columbus day with Indigenous Peoples' day, and added Armistice day, as exceptions to the definition of \"business day\" as used in this section; in Subsection C, Paragraph C(1), after \"New Year's day\", deleted \"Washington's birthday\" and added \"President's day\", after \"Labor day\", deleted \"Columbus\" and added \"Indigenous Peoples'\", and after the next occurrence of \"day\", added \"Armistice day and\".\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, inserted Subparagraph C(3)(f) and made stylistic changes.\n\nAm.

A person shall not utilize an automated telephone dialing or push-button or tone-activated address signaling system with a prerecorded message to solicit persons to purchase goods or services unless there is an established business relationship between the persons and the person being called consents to hear the prerecorded message.\n\nB. It is unlawful under the Unfair Practices Act for a person to make a telephone solicitation for a purchase of goods or services:\n\n(1) without disclosing within fifteen seconds of the time the person being called answers the name of the sponsor and the primary purpose of the contact;\n\n(2) that misrepresents the primary purpose of a telephone solicitation of a residential subscriber as a \"courtesy call\", a \"public service information call\" or some other euphemism;\n\n(3) under the guise of research or a survey when the real intent is to sell goods or services;\n\n(4) without disclosing, prior to commitments by customers, the cost of the goods or services, all terms, conditions, payment plans and the amount or existence of any extra charges such as shipping and handling;\n\n(5) that are received before 9:00 a.m. or after 9:00 p.m.;\n\n(6) using automatic dialing equipment unless the telephone immediately releases the line when the called party disconnects;\n\n(7) using automatic dialing equipment that dials and engages the telephone numbers of more than one person at a time but allows the possibility of a called person not being connected to the calling person for some period not exceeding that established by the federal trade commission at 16 C.F.R. Sections 310(b)(1)(iv) and 310.4(b)(4); and\n\n(8) in which credit card numbers are requested before the prospective purchaser expresses a desire to use a credit card to pay for the purchase.\n\nC. It is unlawful for a person to:\n\n(1) make a telephone solicitation of a residential subscriber whose telephone number has been on the national do-not-call registry, established by the federal trade commission, for at least three months prior to the date the call is made; or\n\n(2) use a method to block or otherwise intentionally circumvent a residential subscriber's use of a caller identification service pursuant to the Consumer No-Call Act [repealed].\n\nD. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"established business relationship\" means a relationship that:\n\n(a) was formed, prior to a telephone solicitation, through a voluntary, two-way communication between a seller or telephone solicitor and a residential subscriber, with or without consideration, on the basis of an application, purchase, ongoing contractual agreement or commercial transaction between the parties regarding products or services offered by the seller or telephone solicitor; and\n\n(b) currently exists or has existed within the immediately preceding twelve months;\n\n(2) \"local exchange company\" means a telecommunications company that provides the transmission of two-way interactive switched voice communications within a local exchange area;\n\n(3) \"residential subscriber\" means a person who has subscribed to residential telephone service from a local exchange company or the other persons living or residing with such person; and\n\n(4) \"telephone solicitation\" means a voice or telefacsimile communication over a telephone line for the purpose of encouraging the purchase or rental of or investment in property, goods or services and includes a communication described in this subsection through the use of automatic dialing and recorded message equipment or by other means, but \"telephone solicitation\" does not include a communication:\n\n(a) to a residential subscriber with that subscriber's prior express invitation or permission;\n\n(b) by or on behalf of a person with whom a residential subscriber has an established business relationship;\n\n(c) made for the sole purpose of urging support for or opposition to a political candidate or ballot issue;\n\n(d) made for the sole purpose of conducting political polls or soliciting the expression of opinions, ideas or votes; or\n\n(e) by a person who is a duly licensed real estate broker pursuant to Section 61-29-11 NMSA 1978, who is a resident of the state and whose telephone call to the consumer is for the sole purpose of selling, exchanging, purchasing, renting, listing for sale or rent or leasing real estate in accordance with the provisions for which he or she is licensed and not in conjunction with any other offer.\n\nHistory:Laws 1989, ch. 309, § 2; 2003, ch. 167, § 10.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law. The Consumer No-Call Act, 57-12A-1 to 57-12A-7 NMSA 1978, was repealed on July 25, 2003, the date the federal communications commission adopted the delivery restrictions rules, 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200 (2004).\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, added \"prohibited telephone solicitation\" in the section heading; in Subsection A, substituted \"established\" for \"existing\" following \"there is an\"; rewrote Subsection B; and added Subsections C and D.\n\nSection applies to cellular telephone users as well as landline telephone users.— Where plaintiff, a consumer who received robo-calls designed to sell a type of discounted medical benefit plan, brought an action against a telemarketer and its purported agent, alleging that defendants violated the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act, §§ 57-12-1 through 57-12-26 NMSA 1978 (NMUPA), by repeatedly calling her cellular telephone and refusing to identify themselves, and where defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that § 57-12-22(C)(1) only prohibits calls to landline telephones and not to cellular telephones, defendant's motion to dismiss was denied because the plain meaning of this section prohibits calls to all telephone numbers on the national do-not-call registry regardless of whether the telephone number belongs to a wireless telephone or a landline telephone. The purpose of this section of the NMUPA is to reduce unwanted telephone solicitation.Mohon v. Agentra LLC, 400 F. Supp. 3d 1189 (D. N.M. 2019).\n\nPhone owner stated a claim under the Unfair Practices Act.— Where plaintiff alleged that defendants, or defendants' agents on defendants' behalf, made telephone solicitations to plaintiff at his cellular number more than once within twelve months despite the fact his phone number had been continuously listed on the federal Do Not Call Registry at all relevant times, and that during one call, plaintiff had a conversation with a telemarketer for over fifteen seconds, but at no time during the call did the telemarketer identify the seller or sponsor of the call, but instead used a fake name, and where defendants argued that plaintiff's allegations were insufficient to establish a violation of the Unfair Practices Act (UPA), claiming that the relevant provisions of the UPA apply only to solicitations made to residential land lines and that the UPA intended to exclude cell phone users, the district court denied defendants' motion to dismiss, because plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to state a claim under § 57-12-22(B)(1) NMSA 1978, and there is nothing in the UPA that would indicate the legislature intended to exclude wireless telephone users from provisions related to unwanted telephone solicitations.Mestas v.
