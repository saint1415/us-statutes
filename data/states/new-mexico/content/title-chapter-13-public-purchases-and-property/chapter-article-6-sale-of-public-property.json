Att'y Gen. No. 63-106.\n\nAgreements should contain express condition regarding approval requirement.— The board of regents of the New Mexico school for the deaf could solicit bids from purchasers for the sale of property over $50.00 (now $5,000) in value and could enter into an agreement of sale with individuals, subject to the express provision that such sale would not be final or binding upon the institution until or unless approved by the state board of finance. 1963 Op.

However, if the current resale value of the property leased exceeds $5,000, the department of finance and administration must, pursuant to this section, approve any extensions. And, if a lease is extended so that it extends beyond the 25-year period specified in 13-6-3 NMSA 1978, legislative approval is required. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-57.\n\nExclusive rights to private or religious group.— If the public body concerned desires to enter into a lease of real property to any private party or religious group and proposes to give exclusive right of possession and occupancy to lands and buildings, the state board of finance must give its approval pursuant to this section. 1964 Op.

Att'y Gen. No. 61-123.\n\nInsofar as a soil conservation district (now soil and water conservation district) does have power of sale of its assets, this power is subject to regulation by the legislature. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-125.\n\nWhen permission not necessary.— When the use permitted by lease of a public body is temporary or brief, and limited to hours when the property is not needed for public purposes, the approval of the state board of finance is not necessary, and the public body may or may not authorize such usage according to its discretion. 1964 Op.

Att'y Gen. No. 64-13.\n\nWhen reimbursement necessary.— Because of the requirement of N.M. Const., art. IX, § 14, it is incumbent upon any public agency or commission to obtain reimbursement for any actual expenses occasioned by reason of permitted private use of public facilities. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-92.\n\nLong-term lease with boys school permissible.— A municipality may enter into a long-term lease with the New Mexico boys school for land and buildings for the purpose of setting up a recreation center for the community and the surrounding area, and which will be under the control and supervision of the municipality. 1968 Op.

Att'y Gen. No. 80-10.\n\nPower to credit where no specific directions.— In the absence of a specific direction the director (secretary) of the department of finance and administration has the power to credit the money received from a sale of the state police headquarters to whatever fund of the state police he deems appropriate. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-56.\n\nHighway department condemnation proceeds.— Even though legislative approval prior to condemnation by the state highway department is not necessary under 42-2-3 NMSA 1978, this section still controls the distribution of proceeds from the sale or condemnation. 1969 Op.

No. 69-56.\n\nGenerally.— If the consideration for any sale, trade or lease by a state agency, board, department, commission or institution shall be for consideration of $100,000 or more (and for a period exceeding 25 years), it is subject to the ratification and approval of the state legislature prior to such sale, trade or lease becoming effective. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-143.\n\nCondemnation is sale of property.1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-144.\n\n99-year lease.— Lease of 99 years entered into by board of directors of Los Lunas hospital and training school had to be approved pursuant to the provisions of this section. Under this section the duration of the lease and remuneration could be negotiated by the parties subject to the approval of either the legislature or the state board of finance depending upon the amount of money involved. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-28.\n\nWhen other party is also public agency.— Requirement under this section for prior approval by the state legislature is applicable even though the other party to such agreement may be another public agency such as the state land office or the state highway commission [state transportation commission], since the statutory exemption applies only to such bodies. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-143.\n\nState fair commission.— This section necessitates legislative confirmation of any lease of realty of the New Mexico state fair commission for a period exceeding 25 years and which involves a consideration of $100,000 or more. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-92.\n\nExtension of leases.— State law does not require the state fair commission to use a bid or request for proposal when extending leases beyond the term of an existing contract. However, if the current resale value of the property leased exceeds $5,000, the department of finance and administration must, pursuant to this section, approve any extensions. And, if a lease is extended so that it extends beyond the 25-year period specified in this section, legislative approval is required. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-57.\n\nWhen approval not needed.— The state highway department (now state highway and transportation department [department of transportation]) may condemn lands belonging to the intertribal Indian ceremonial association without legislative approval if the provisions of 42-2-3 NMSA 1978 are complied with. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-144.\n\nSchool districts not mentioned.— School districts are not here mentioned at all and certainly it cannot be argued that local school districts are agencies, boards, departments, commissions or institutions of this state. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-54.",
