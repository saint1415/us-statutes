added A new Subsection C and redesignated former Subsection C as Subsection D; added new Subsections E through G and redesignated former Subsections D through J as Subsections H through N, respectively; and in Subsection K, after \"Subsection\", deleted \"E or F\" and added \"I or J\".\n\nThe second 2015 amendment,effective July 1, 2015, provided that a business or contractor is ineligible to receive a certificate of preference and is subject to administrative penalties if the administrative hearings office makes a finding that the business or contractor provided false information to the taxation and revenue department or did not perform as specified in a bid or proposal;

      "text": "A. The Procurement Code shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its purposes and policies.\n\nB. All references in law to the Public Purchases Act [repealed] shall be construed to be references to the Procurement Code.\n\nC. The purposes of the Procurement Code are to provide for the fair and equitable treatment of all persons involved in public procurement, to maximize the purchasing value of public funds and to provide safeguards for maintaining a procurement system of quality and integrity.\n\nHistory:Laws 1984, ch. 65, § 2.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nThe Public Purchases Act, referred to in Subsection B, was compiled as 13-1-1 to 13-1-27 NMSA 1978, and was repealed by Laws 1984, ch. 65, § 175, effective November 1, 1984.\n\nPurposes.— The Procurement Code protects against the evils of favoritism, nepotism, patronage, collusion, fraud, and corruption in the award of public contracts.Planning & Design Solutions v. City of Santa Fe, 1994-NMSC-112, 118 N.M. 707, 885 P.2d 628.\n\nDuty of fair and equitable treatment.— The duty of good faith and fair dealing in the bidding process required that the city abide by the strictures of the Procurement Code and the purchasing manual. Specifically, the criteria provided by the city were an implied contract that if any bids were accepted, the acceptance would be based on these criteria and no others.Planning & Design Solutions v. City of Santa Fe, 1994-NMSC-112, 118 N.M. 707, 885 P.2d 628.\n\nBreach of implied contract to follow Procurement Code.— By unlawfully introducing, considering, and relying on a criterion not listed in the request, the city breached an informal contract that it would follow the Procurement Code and the purchasing manual in considering each bid. Thus, though no formal contract was ever concluded between the parties, the city's conduct was a breach of an implied contract for which damages will lie.Planning & Design Solutions v. City of Santa Fe, 1994-NMSC-112, 118 N.M. 707, 885 P.2d 628.\n\nLicensed contractors only.— Reading the Procurement Code and the Construction Industries Licensing Act, Chapter 60, Article 13 NMSA 1978, together, it is clear that the legislature intended (1) that public contracts should be awarded only to licensed contractors and (2) that purchasing authorities should be relieved from the necessity of making an independent investigation into the qualifications and fiscal responsibility of a contractor who is not licensed at the time of bidding. Thus, the doctrine of substantial compliance does not apply to the requirement of 60-13-12B NMSA 1978 that a contractor have a valid license when submitting a bid on a public contract.BC&L Pavement Servs. v. Higgins, 2002-NMCA-087, 132 N.M. 490, 51 P.3d 533.",

      "text": "A. Except as otherwise provided in the Procurement Code, that code shall apply to every expenditure by state agencies and local public bodies for the procurement of items of tangible personal property, services and construction. That code also applies to concession contracts at the New Mexico state fair in excess of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), whether those concession contracts generate revenue and earnings or expand funds.\n\nB. When a procurement involves the expenditure of federal funds, the procurement shall be conducted in accordance with mandatory applicable federal law and regulations. When mandatory applicable federal law or regulations are inconsistent with the provisions of the Procurement Code, compliance with federal law or regulations shall be compliance with the Procurement Code.\n\nHistory:Laws 1984, ch. 65, § 3; 1994, ch. 143, § 1; 2005, ch. 131, § 1.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, amended Subsection A to provide that the Procurement Code increase the applicability of the code for concession contracts at the state fair from ten to twenty thousand dollars.\n\nThe 1994 amendment,effective July 1, 1994, in Subsection A, deleted \"and\" preceding \"construction\" and added the language following \"construction\".\n\nAn incorporated electric cooperativeis neither a state agency nor a local public body; therefore, the Procurement Code does not apply to it.Fratello v. Socorro Elec. Corp., 1988-NMSC-058, 107 N.M. 378, 758 P.2d 792.\n\nCooperative formed pursuant to the Joint Powers Agreements Act.— An agreement entered into by 30 school districts forming a cooperative pursuant to the Joint Powers Agreements Act, Section 11-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., for the purpose of procuring and delivering educational services, was required to comply with the provisions of the Procurement Code.State ex rel. Educ. Assmts. Sys. v. Cooperative Educ. Servs., 1993-NMCA-024, 115 N.M. 196, 848 P.2d 1123.\n\nApplicable to municipalities.— The Procurement Code applies to all nonfederal expenditures by state agencies and local public bodies for the procurement of items of tangible personal property, services, and construction.Planning & Design Solutions v. City of Santa Fe, 1994-NMSC-112, 118 N.M. 707, 885 P.2d 628.\n\nThe Procurement Code applies to contingent-fee contracts for legal services.— The proper procedure for expending public funds when a state agency recovers money from a court judgment or settlement, according to Ch. 6, Art. 10 NMSA 1978, generally requires that the recovered money, which belongs to the state agency, should be paid into the state treasury, and any payments of the lawyers' fees from public money should be made pursuant to legislative appropriation and further made upon warrants drawn by the secretary of the department of finance and administration upon the state treasury, but assuming that the state agency or local public body has the constitutional or statutory authority to enter into contingency-fee contracts for legal services, the Procurement Code applies to such agreements, because at the conclusion of a contingent-fee matter, when a lawyer withdraws their fee and any costs from the fund that the lawyer recovers for a state agency or a local public body, the government body makes an \"expenditure\" for legal services under 13-1-30(A) NMSA 1978, and the Procurement Code applies to every expenditure by state agencies and local public bodies for the procurement of tangible personal property, services, and construction. The application of the Procurement Code to a state agency's or local public body's selection of a contractor providing legal services necessarily includes the Procurement Code's central rule that government contracts be awarded following a competitive, sealed process and also includes several specific safeguards that are designed to deter conflicts of interest, undue influence,quid pro quoconduct, and the appearance thereof. 2023 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2023-07.\n\nPrivate non-profit corporations.— The standard to be applied when determining whether private non-profit corporations that lease hospitals from government entities meet the definition of \"local public bodies\" under this section and are, therefore, subject to the Procurement Code is whether under the totality of the circumstances the private entity is so intertwined with a public entity that the private entity becomes an alter ego of the public entity.Memorial Med. Ctr. v. Tatsch Constr., Inc., 2000-NMSC-030, 129 N.M. 677, 12 P.3d 431.\n\nThe youth conservation corps commission, which is administratively attached to the New Mexico energy, minerals and natural resources department, is subject to the Procurement Code.— The Procurement Code applies to every expenditure by state agencies and local public bodies for the procurement of items of tangible personal property, services and construction, and therefore, the youth conservation corps commission (YCCC), which is administratively attached to the New Mexico energy, minerals and natural resources department and which transfers funds from the state to competitively selected recipients to carry out public projects with corps members, is subject to the Procurement Code, because the distribution of YCCC funds to develop, administer and manage public projects for its youth corps members is a service as defined in the Procurement Code. 2024 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 24-12.\n\nThe Procurement Code does not prohibit a business significantly owned by a legislator from applying for and receiving federal CARES relief funds.— The Procurement Code does not prohibit a business significantly owned by a legislator from applying for and receiving federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) relief funds, because CARES relief grants do not result in the acquisition of tangible personal property, services or construction. Accordingly, the Procurement Code does not apply to the application for CARES relief grants by a business in which the legislator has an interest. 2021 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2021-03.\n\nAgreement to administer deferred compensation program.— The public employees' retirement board's administrator's agreement with the company provided professional services by administering and marketing the state's deferred compensation program must be let for proposals pursuant to the Procurement Code to the extent the administrator receives as compensation an amount exceeding $20,000, although the administrator's sole compensation under the contract derives from sales commission, etc., from the underwriter. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-35.\n\nFederal law governed state agency on aging's designation of area agencies on aging,and such agencies need not qualify for sole source status under this article. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-72.\n\nPurchase of computer voting devices.— Section 1-9-14 NMSA 1978, governing computer voting devices, does not bar application of the Procurement Code to the purchase of internal computers used to record and tabulate votes, and the Procurement Code applies to such machines used for such purposes after November 1, 1984, the effective date of the Procurement Code. 1988 Op.

A central purchasing office, in an invitation for bids or a request for proposals, may require all or any part of a sealed bid or a competitive sealed proposal to be submitted electronically if the office determines that an electronic submission will be advantageous to the procurement process. If electronic submission is required:\n\n(1) no hard copy documentation shall be submitted to the central purchasing office prior to the award of the contract, except as specifically identified in the invitation for bids or the request for proposals;\n\n(2) the invitation for bids or request for proposals shall specify an opening date and time, a fixed closing date and time and an email account or other secure electronic location to which the electronic bid or proposal shall be submitted;\n\n(3) sealed bids submitted electronically shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids.

Educ. Assessments Sys. v. Coop. Educ. Servs., 1993-NMCA-024, 115 N.M. 196, 848 P.2d 1123.\n\nApplicability of section to school districts.— The provision of Section 22-5-4N NMSA 1978 of the [Public] School Code, requiring that contracts for expenditure of money be made in accordance with the Procurement Code, requires school boards to contract according to all but two sections of the entire Procurement Code; this means that all bidding requirements of the Code, including the exemptions in this section, apply to school district contracts.Morningstar Water Users Ass'n v. Farmington Mun. Sch. Dist. No. 5, 1995-NMSC-052, 120 N.M. 307, 901 P.2d 725.\n\nTariff permitting utility to recover costs of relocationrequired by a local ordinance did not violate the New Mexico Procurement Code by failing to provide for the seeking of bids by local governments because it fell within the specific statutory exception for purchases of utility facilities.City of Albuquerque v. New Mexico Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2003-NMSC-028, 134 N.M. 472, 79 P.3d 297.\n\nSale of water services by municipality to school district.— A municipality and a school district fall within the definition of \"local public bodies\" in Section 13-1-67 NMSA 1978, and, thus, a transaction involving the purchase of water services by the school district from the water utility of the municipality is within the exemptions of Subsections A and D because the municipality is a local public body selling water services to another local public body and the school district is purchasing \"publicly provided\" water.Morningstar Water Users Ass'n v. Farmington Mun. Sch. Dist. No. 5, 1995-NMSC-052, 120 N.M. 307, 901 P.2d 725.\n\nEmergency requirements not applicable to exempt transaction.— The emergency provisions of Section 13-1-127 NMSA 1978 did not apply to a contract for the purchase of water services by a school district from the water utility of a municipality which was within the exemptions contained in Subsections A and D of this section.Morningstar Water Users Ass'n v. Farmington Mun. Sch. Dist. No. 5, 1995-NMSC-052, 120 N.M. 307, 901 P.2d 725.\n\nWorkers' compensation administration case manager's fee not exempt as a litigation expense.— The services provided by a case manager under the worker's compensation administration (WCA) are not incurred in connection with litigation. A WCA case manager's fees are not an expense of litigation pursuant to Subsection R of this section, but are incurred following a determination that a worker is injured or disabled and entitled to benefits under the WCA, and ongoing coordination of the healthcare services is required.Trace v. University of N.M. Hosp., 2015-NMCA-083.\n\nIn a workers' compensation case, where the case manager's contract with the workers' compensation administration, to coordinate health care services provided to worker, expired, the workers' compensation judge (WCJ) erred in finding that the case manager's services constituted a litigation expense exempt from the Procurement Code, and the WCJ was without statutory authority to order that the case manager continue providing services as worker's case manager in the absence of a contract under the Procurement Code.Trace v. University of N.M. Hosp., 2015-NMCA-083.\n\nPrepayment prohibition applies to tangible personal property, services and construction.— Each subsection of 13-1-158 NMSA 1978 governing payment for purchases, including the prohibition on prepayment, specifically references \"services\" in addition to construction or items of tangible personal property, and therefore a central purchasing office or procuring agency is prohibited from prepaying for the purchase of any service or construction, unless prepayment is authorized by exemption of the purchase under 13-1-98 NMSA 1978. 2024 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2024-04.\n\nThe Procurement Code does not allow partial payment prior to certification of receipt of services, construction or items of tangible property.— Section 13-1-158(A) NMSA 1978 prohibits the payment of any warrant, check or negotiable instrument unless an exception applies or the agency certifies the services, construction, or items of tangible property have been received and meet specifications, and therefore a partial payment prior to that certification of receipt would be an impermissible payment under the plain language of the Procurement Code. 2024 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2024-04.\n\nMulti-year contracts are permissible, but must otherwise meet the Procurement Code's specific conditions required for such agreements.— A procuring agency may prepay for web-based and electronic subscriptions so long as the purchase is under $10,000, and therefore prepayment of a multi-year contract for electronic subscriptions not exceeding ten thousand dollars does not violate 13-1-158(A) NMSA 1978, while multi-year contracts exceeding ten thousand dollars, although permissible, do not fall within the exemption specified in 13-1-98(J) NMSA 1978, and therefore a procuring agency may not pay for the services prior to the agency's certification that the services have been received and meet specifications. 2024 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2024-04.\n\nThe Procurement Code generally prohibits prepayment for the purchase of items of tangible personal property.— Where the purchase of items of tangible personal property is subject to the Procurement Code, there is a general rule against prepayment. 2023 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2023-04.\n\nA municipality's purchase of a firetruck is not exempt from the Procurement Code's general rule against prepayment.— The Procurement Code generally prohibits prepayment for the purchase of items of tangible personal property, 13-1-158 NMSA 1978, an exception of which are those purchases that are excluded from the Procurement Code's scope, and therefore where a municipality is considering purchasing a firetruck, an item subject to the Procurement Code, under a statewide price agreement with the National Association of State Procurement Officials, the municipality may not prepay for the firetruck and may only pay for the truck after the municipality's central purchasing office certifies that the truck has been received and meets the specifications that the municipality bargained for. Moreover, the fact that the municipality could get a discount for prepayment and the fact that the vendor would provide the municipality with a performance bond following the receipt of any prepayment do not operate as exceptions to the Procurement Code's general rule against prepayment. 2023 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2023-04.\n\nSelf-dealing by non-state-employed council members does not violate the Procurement Code.— The Procurement Code does not prohibit members of the New Mexico council for purchasing from persons with disabilities (council) from voting to approve a contract subject to the State Use Act, 13-1C-1 to 13-1C-7 NMSA 1978, between a state agency or local public body and a council member or a company in which the council member has a financial interest. Procurements under the State Use Act are exempt from the requirements of the Procurement Code, and therefore the Procurement Code's conflict of interest provisions do not prohibit a council member from participating in an award of a contract subject to the State Use Act. 2020 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2020-07.\n\nHome rule municipality's sponsorship to planned parenthood of New Mexico does not implicate the Procurement Code.— The Procurement Code, pursuant to 13-1-98(K) NMSA 1978, does not apply to municipalities having adopted home rule charters and having enacted their own purchasing ordinances, and therefore, where the Albuquerque city council passed a floor amendment to the city's operating budget bill, which added $250,000 for a council-directed sponsorship to planned parenthood of New Mexico, a private corporation, the Procurement Code was not implicated, because the city of Albuquerque has adopted a home rule charter and has enacted its own purchasing ordinance. The city's own procurement ordinance therefore governs all purchasing transactions of the city, including a transaction between the city of Albuquerque and planned parenthood of New Mexico, and shall serve to exempt the city from all provisions of the New Mexico Procurement Code. 2022 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2022-07.\n\nScope of exemption provision.— Only when centralized control was thought to be harmful or unproductive of savings were exemptions allowed by the former Public Purchases Act. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-87.\n\nWhen public notice and competitive bidding required.— A professional legal services contract in excess of $1,000 between a state agency and legislator may be awarded only after public notice and competitive bidding. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-23.\n\nAttempt to add exemption.— Section 73-20-45H NMSA 1978 attempts to add an exemption to the former State Purchasing Act by reference to that act. Properly the State Purchasing Act should have been amended. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-110.\n\nEffect.— Section 73-20-45H NMSA 1978, having the same object as and being prior and repugnant to the former Public Purchases Act, is repealed by implication. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-110.\n\nJail facilities exemptions.— Laws 1987, ch. 348, § 2 amended this section to permit local public bodies to enter into contracts with an independent contractor for construction and operation of a jail facility without competitive bidding. The financing and design of a jail facility are also exempt from this article, as long as the local public body does not have a direct contractual relationship with the parties responsible for designing and financing the facility. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-47.\n\nContract for professional services of insurance agency exempt.— A contract whereby an insurance agency would provide technical or professional services to the central purchasing office of a local public body for a fee would have been exempt from the former Public Purchases Act. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-135.\n\nSale of manual by state employee.— The Procurement Code does not apply to the sale of a manual by a state employee to the New Mexico state department of Public safety [public safety department], as long as the department purchases the manual from the copyright holder. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-42.",

In addition to the requirement for the prime contractor and subcontractors to be registered as provided in Section 13-4-13.1 NMSA 1978, bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which requirements may include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery and suitability for a particular purpose. Those criteria such as discounts, transportation costs and total or life-cycle costs that will affect the bid price shall be objectively measurable, which shall be defined by rule. The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that are not set forth in the invitation for bids. A bid submitted by a prime contractor that was not registered as required by Section 13-4-13.1 NMSA 1978 shall not be considered for award. A bid submitted by a registered prime contractor that includes any subcontractor that is not registered in accordance with that section may be considered for award following substitution of a registered subcontractor for any unregistered subcontractor in accordance with Section 13-4-36 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. If the lowest responsible bid has otherwise qualified, and if there is no change in the original terms and conditions, the lowest bidder may negotiate with the purchaser for a lower total bid in order to avoid rejection of all bids for the reason that the lowest bid was up to ten percent higher than budgeted project funds. Such negotiation shall not be allowed if the lowest bid was more than ten percent over budgeted project funds.\n\nHistory:Laws 1984, ch. 65, § 78; 1987, ch. 348, § 4; 2005, ch. 98, § 1.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, in Subsection A, added the requirement that prime contractors and subcontractors be registered as criteria for bid evaluation; provided that a bid submitted by a prime contractor who is not registered shall not be considered for award; and provided that a bid by a registered prime contractor that includes a bid by any subcontractor who is not registered may be considered for award after the substitution of a registered subcontractor for any unregistered subcontractor.\n\nEvaluation of bids.— All the acts in question by the city - introducing a locality requirement after the bids were opened, awarding the contract to the fourth-ranked bidder, and rejecting the proposals after making a contract award - were arbitrary and capricious.

A construction manager at risk delivery method may be used when a governing body determines that it is in its interest to use that method on a specific educational facility construction project, provided that the construction manager at risk shall be selected pursuant to the provisions of this section.\n\nB. The governing body shall form a selection committee of at least three members with at least one member being an architect or engineer. The selection committee shall develop an evaluation process, including a multiphase procedure consisting of two or three steps. A two-step procedure may be used when the total amount of money available for the project is less than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) and shall include a request for qualifications and an interview. A three-step procedure shall consist of a request for qualifications, a request for proposals and an interview.\n\nC. A request for qualifications shall be published in accordance with Section 13-1-104 NMSA 1978 and shall include at a minimum the following:\n\n(1) a statement of the minimum qualifications for the construction manager at risk, including the requirements for:\n\n(a) a contractor's license for the type of work to be performed, issued pursuant to the Construction Industries Licensing Act [Chapter 60, Article 13 NMSA 1978];\n\n(b) registration pursuant to Section 13-4-13.1 NMSA 1978; and\n\n(c) a minimum bond capacity;\n\n(2) a statement of the scope of work to be performed, including:\n\n(a) the location of the project and the total amount of money available for the project;\n\n(b) a proposed schedule, including a deadline for submission of the statements of qualification;\n\n(c) specific project requirements and deliverables;\n\n(d) the composition of the selection committee;\n\n(e) a description of the process the selection committee shall use to evaluate qualifications;\n\n(f) a proposed contract; and\n\n(g) a detailed statement of the relationships and obligations of all parties, including the construction manager at risk, agents of the governing body, such as an architect or engineer, and the governing body;\n\n(3) a verification of the maximum allowable construction cost; and\n\n(4) a request for a proposal bond as required by Section 13-1-146 NMSA 1978.\n\nD.

Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties or unless otherwise specified in the invitation for bids, request for proposals or other solicitation, within fifteen days from the date the central purchasing office or using agency receives written notice from the contractor that payment is requested for services or construction completed or items of tangible personal property delivered on site and received, the central purchasing office or using agency shall issue a written certification of complete or partial acceptance or rejection of the services, construction or items of tangible personal property.\n\nC.

Ethics Comm'n No. 2024-04.\n\nSection does not allow partial payment prior to certification of receipt of services, construction or items of tangible property.— Section 13-1-158(A) NMSA 1978 prohibits the payment of any warrant, check or negotiable instrument unless an exception applies or the agency certifies the services, construction, or items of tangible property have been received and meet specifications, and therefore a partial payment prior to that certification of receipt would be an impermissible payment under the plain language of the statute. 2024 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2024-04.\n\nTangible personal property must be delivered in order to meet the \"receipt\" requirement for delivery of goods.— To the extent the tangible personal property is not subject to an exclusion from the prepayment prohibition, goods must be, as a general matter, delivered on site and received by the agency to constitute \"receipt\" for purposes of 13-1-158(A) NMSA 1978, and therefore the plain language of the statute would preclude a contract term allowing goods to be stored by the vendor. If the goods remained in the vendor's possession, it would be impractical for the agency to make the inspection required by 13-1-157 NMSA 1978. 2024 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2024-04.\n\nMulti-year contracts are permissible, but must otherwise meet the Procurement Code's specific conditions required for such agreements.— A procuring agency may prepay for web-based and electronic subscriptions so long as the purchase is under $10,000, and therefore prepayment of a multi-year contract for electronic subscriptions not exceeding ten thousand dollars does not violate 13-1-158(A) NMSA 1978, while multi-year contracts exceeding ten thousand dollars, although permissible, do not fall within the exemption specified in 13-1-98(J) NMSA 1978, and therefore a procuring agency may not pay for the services prior to the agency's certification that the services have been received and meet specifications. 2024 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2024-04.\n\nGeneral rule against prepayment.— Where the purchase of items of tangible personal property is subject to the Procurement Code, there is a general rule against prepayment. 2023 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2023-04.\n\nMunicipality prohibited from prepaying for the purchase of a firetruck.— The Procurement Code generally prohibits prepayment for the purchase of items of tangible personal property, an exception of which are those purchases that are excluded from the Procurement Code's scope, and therefore where a municipality is considering purchasing a firetruck, an item subject to the Procurement Code, under a statewide price agreement with the National Association of State Procurement Officials, the municipality may not prepay for the firetruck and may only pay for the truck after the municipality's central purchasing office certifies that the truck has been received and meets the specifications that the municipality bargained for. Moreover, the fact that the municipality could get a discount for prepayment and the fact that the vendor would provide the municipality with a performance bond following the receipt of any prepayment do not operate as exceptions to the Procurement Code's general rule against prepayment. 2023 Op.
