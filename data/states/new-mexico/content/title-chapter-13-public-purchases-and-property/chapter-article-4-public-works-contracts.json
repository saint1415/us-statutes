      "heading": "Public works contracts.Section 13-4-1",
      "text": "It is the duty of every office, department, institution, board, commission or other governing body or officer thereof of this state or of any political subdivision thereof to award all contracts for the construction of public works or for the repair, reconstruction, including highway reconstruction, demolition or alteration thereof, to a resident contractor whenever practicable.\n\nHistory:Laws 1933, ch. 50, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 6-501; 1953 Comp., § 6-6-1; Laws 1965, ch. 185, § 1; 1984, ch. 66, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For county buildings upon change of county seat,see4-34-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor contracts for courthouses, jails or bridges after approval of bond issue,see4-49-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor employees to be residents,see10-1-6 to 10-1-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nAward to resident contractor is mandatory.— The formula in Section 13-4-2E NMSA 1978 is a working definition of practicality such that the \"whenever practicable\" of Section 13-4-1 NMSA 1978 is measured by the formula in Section 13-4-2E NMSA 1978 and if a resident contractor bids within five percent of a nonresident contractor, the governmental entity has no discretion but to award the contract to the resident contractor.Bradbury & Stamm Constr. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs of Bernalillo Cnty., 2001-NMCA-106, 131 N.M. 293, 35 P.3d 298.\n\nResident contractor construed.— The \"whenever practicable\" language of Section 13-4-1 is measured by the formula set out in Section 13-4-2(E), so that it is no longer necessary for a governmental entity to make a written finding why an award to the resident contractor is not 'practicable' under the circumstances,\" as prevailing authority before 1984 demanded; if a resident contractor does not bid within 5 percent of a nonresident contractor's low bid, the legislature has decided as a matter of law that the taxpayer will not be burdened with the additional expenditure of a local preference, and the governmental entity need not justify its decision to go out of state.Ballard v. Chavez, 1994-NMSC-007, 117 N.M. 1, 868 P.2d 646.\n\n\"Practicable\" defined.— \"Practicable\" has been defined by the courts to mean something which is capable of being performed or effected under the prevailing circumstances. In making a determination of practicability or nonpracticability, the public body involved must necessarily consider the availability of funds, reliability of the contractor, time factors involved in the construction and other aspects incident to such construction project. 1965 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-05.\n\nWhen written finding required.— An express written finding is required if a New Mexico contractor is not awarded such contract, spelling out the basis for such finding. 1965 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-05.\n\nEffect on Ute dam contracts.— The provisions of this article have definite application to the proposed public works project for the construction of the Ute dam. Consequently, any contract executed in violation of this article is void and of no effect, unless a finding is made and a valid substantiation given as to why such award to a non-New Mexico contractor is not \"practicable.\" 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-80.\n\nEffect on New Mexico interstate stream commission.— The provisions of this article have application to a proposed construction project to be awarded by the New Mexico interstate stream commission. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-80.\n\nLegislative intent.— It is apparent that the legislature clearly intended that public construction projects come within the safeguards of the former Public Purchases Act, and be awarded whenever practicable to New Mexico contractors. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-80.\n\nPreclusion from bidding.— New Mexico contractors may not properly be precluded from bidding upon public works construction projects financed from state funds. Under the former Public Purchases Act, however, the state purchasing agent was invested with certain discretion in the awarding or rejection of bids. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-80.\n\nLaw reviews.— For survey of construction law in New Mexico, see 18 N.M.L. Rev. 331 (1988).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —64 Am.

When a public body awards a contract using a formal request for proposals process, not including contracts awarded on a point-based system, the public body shall award an additional:\n\n(1) eight percent of the total weight of all the factors used in evaluating the proposals to a resident contractor or Native American resident contractor; or\n\n(2) ten percent of the total weight of all the factors used in evaluating the proposals to a resident veteran contractor or Native American resident veteran contractor that has annual gross revenues of up to six million dollars ($6,000,000) in the preceding tax year.\n\nD.

The procedures provided in Sections 13-1-172 through 13-1-183 NMSA 1978 or in an applicable purchasing ordinance apply to a protest to a public body concerning the awarding of a contract in violation of this section.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 13-4-2, enacted by Laws 1984, ch. 66, § 2; 1988, ch. 84, § 3; 1989, ch. 310, § 2; 1997, ch. 1, § 3; 1997, ch. 2, § 3; 2001, ch. 174, § 1; 2011 (1st S.S.), ch. 3, § 5; 2012, ch. 56, § 5; 2012, ch. 56, § 6; 2016, ch. 5, § 2; 2022, ch. 6, § 3.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 2016, ch. 5, § 4, effective July 1, 2016, repealed Laws 2012, ch. 56, § 6, which was to become effective July 1, 2022. For provisions of former section,seethe 2015 NMSA 1978 onNMOneSource.com.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective July 1, 2022, increased the preference for New Mexico resident contractors, increased the maximum allowable gross revenue for resident veteran contractors to qualify for certain preferences, amended existing provisions giving a preference to resident contractors and resident veteran contractors to include Native American resident contractors and Native American resident veteran contractors, defined \"Native American resident contractor\" and Native American resident veteran contractor\" for purposes of this section, and removed a provision that prohibited a business from claiming a preference for more than ten consecutive years; in Subsection A, added new Paragraphs A(3) and A(4) and redesignated former Paragraphs A(3) through A(6) as Paragraphs A(5) through A(8), respectively; in Subsection B, Paragraph B(1), after \"resident contractor\", added \"or Native American resident contractor\", after \"to be\", deleted \"five\" and added \"eight\", and in Paragraph B(2), after \"resident veteran contractor\", added \"or Native American resident veteran contractor\", and after \"annual gross revenues of up to\", deleted \"three million dollars ($3,000,000)\" and added \"six million dollars ($6,000,000)\"; in Subsection C, Paragraph C(1), deleted \"five\" and added \"eight\", and after \"resident contractor\", added \"or Native American resident contractor\", and in Paragraph C(2), after \"resident veteran contractor\", added \"or Native American resident veteran contractor\", and after \"annual gross revenues of up to\", deleted \"three million dollars ($3,000,000)\" and added \"six million dollars ($6,000,000)\"; in Subsection D, in Paragraph D(1), after the paragraph designation, deleted \"five\" and added \"eight\", and after \"resident contractor\", added \"or Native American resident contractor\", and in Paragraph D(2), after \"resident veteran contractor\" and added \"or Native American resident veteran contractor\", and after \"annual gross revenues of up to\", deleted \"three million dollars ($3,000,000)\" and added \"six million dollars ($6,000,000)\"; in Subsection E, after the first occurrence of \"resident veteran,\", added \"Native American resident veteran\", and after the next occurrence of \"resident\", added \"Native American resident\"; in Subsection F, deleted \"A resident veteran contractor shall not benefit from the preference pursuant to this section for more than ten consecutive years. A person that is an owner of a business that is a resident veteran contractor shall not benefit from the preference pursuant to this section for more than ten consecutive years\"; and in Subsection G, after \"resident veteran contractor preference\", added \"or a Native American resident contractor preference and a Native American resident veteran contractor preference\".\n\nThe 2016 amendment,effective July 1, 2016, reduced the maximum revenue that a resident veteran contractor can earn to receive the veteran contractor preference, merged the former tiered preferences into one ten percent preference, set a ten consecutive year maximum time for a vendor to use the resident veteran contractor preference, and limited the benefit to one business concurrently; in Subsection B, in Paragraph (1), after the semicolon, added \"or\", in Paragraph (2), after \"annual\", added \"gross\", and after \"revenues of\", deleted \"one million dollars ($1,000,000) or less\" and added \"up to three million dollars ($3,000,000) in the preceding tax year\", and deleted Paragraphs (3) and (4) which provided for a tiered resident veteran contractor preference; in Subsection C, Paragraph (1), after the semicolon, added \"or\", in Paragraph (2), after \"annual\", added \"gross\", and after \"revenues of\", deleted \"one million dollars ($1,000,000) or less\" and added \"up to three million dollars ($3,000,000) in the preceding tax year\", and deleted Paragraphs (3) and (4), which provided for a tiered resident veteran contractor preference; in Subsection D, Paragraph (1), after the semicolon, added \"or\", in Paragraph (2), after \"annual\", added \"gross\", and after \"revenues of\", deleted \"one million dollars ($1,000,000) or less\" and added \"up to three million dollars ($3,000,000) in the preceding tax year\", and deleted Paragraphs (3) and (4), which provided for a tiered resident veteran contractor preference; deleted former Subsection F, which limited the former tiered resident veteran contractor preferences to an aggregate of ten million dollars ($10,000,000) in purchases by public bodies from all resident veteran contractors receiving preferences; and added a new Subsection F.\n\nThe 2012 amendment,effective July 1, 2012, gave resident veteran businesses a preference; in the title, deleted \"Resident contractor defined\"; in Subsection A, in Paragraph (5), after \"Section 13-1-22 NMSA 1978\", added the remainder of the sentence and added Paragraph (6); in Subsection B, added Paragraphs (2) through (4); in Subsection C, in the introductory sentence, after \"proposals process\", added the remainder of the sentence, in Paragraph (1), after \"evaluating the proposals\", deleted \"shall be awarded\" and after \"resident contractor\", deleted \"based on the resident contractor possessing a valid resident contractor certificate; or\", and added Paragraphs (2) through (4); in Subsection D, in the introductory sentence, added \"When a public body makes a purchase using a formal request for proposal process, and\" and after \"point-based system\", deleted \"a\" and added the remainder of the sentence, in Paragraph (1), at the beginning of the sentence, deleted \"resident contractor shall be awarded the equivalent of\", after \"total possible points to\", deleted \"be awarded based on the\" and added \"a\", and after \"resident contractor\", deleted \"possessing a valid resident contractor certificate\", and added Paragraphs (2) through (4); in Subsection E, after \"proposal is submitted by\", deleted \"both resident and\" and added \"a combination of resident veteran, resident or\", after \"nonresident contractors, the\", deleted \"resident contractor\", after \"Subsection B\", deleted \"or\", after \"Subsection B, C\", added \"or D\", after \"this section shall be\", deleted \"reduced\" and added \"calculated\", and after \"will be performed by\" deleted \"a nonresident\" and added \"each\"; and added Subsections F and G.\n\nThe 2011 (1st. S.S.) amendment,effective October 5, 2011, provided a five percent advantage to bids and proposals by resident contractors; eliminated the practice of brokering the preference through joint bids or proposals by resident and non-resident contractors by reducing the preference by the percentage of the contract performed by the nonresident contractor; eliminated the preference for New York state business enterprises; provided the procedure for protesting violations of this section; deleted former Sections A through E, which defined \"resident contractor\", \"New Mexico resident contractor\", \"New York state business enterprise\", and \"affiliate\", provided for awarding a contract to a resident contractor when the bid by the resident contractor is made lower, by the application of a five percent preference, than the lowest bid from a nonresident contractor, and provided for the certification of resident contractors and the issuance of a certification number by the state purchasing agent; and added new Subsections A through E.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, in Subsection B, deleted residency requirements for the majority of stockholders and those who have a beneficial interest in the corporations, partnerships, and trusts who bid with a New Mexico resident contractor in Paragraphs (1) and (2); deleted \"and the individual shall be a citizen of and domiciled in the state\" from Paragraph (3); deleted the paragraph designation D(1) and deleted Paragraph D(2), which contained the definition for \"beneficially owned\" or \"beneficial interest\".\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective January 24, 1997, inserted \"means a New Mexico resident contractor or a New York state business enterprise\" in Subsection A; designated Subsection B and added \"'New Mexico resident contractor' means\" at the beginning; deleted \"New Mexico\" preceding \"Unemployment Compensation Law\" in Paragraph B(4); added Subsection C and redesignated former Subsections B through D as Subsections D through F and substituted \"Subsection E\" for \"Subsection C\" near the end of Subsection F(3).\n\nConstitutionality.— Plaintiff shareholder's privileges and immunities claim under Article 4, § 2 of the United States Constitution was granted where defendant/state burdened the right to own a business by discriminating against owners solely on the basis of citizenship, and plaintiff was able to establish that § 13-1-21A(2) under the former Procurement Contract Code was a better-tailored statute than this section.C.S. McCrossan Constr., Inc. v. Rahn, 96 F. Supp. 2d 1238 (D.N.M. 2000) (decided prior to 2001 amendment, which amended residency requirement provision).\n\nEqual protection.— This section does not violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution because encouraging economic development and supporting the state's road construction industry are legitimate purposes of the resident contractor preference statute.C.S. McCrossan Constr., Inc. v. Rahn, 96 F. Supp. 2d 1238 (D.N.M. 2000).\n\nApplication.— Where a county in New Mexico decided to build a jail and bypassed the resident preference for contractors found in Subsection E, the court of appeals found that the resident preference formula applied to all bids for public works contracts and had to be followed.Bradbury & Stamm Constr. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 2001-NMCA-106, 131 N.M. 293, 35 P.3d 298.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —64 Am.

Every contract or project in excess of sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) that the state or any political subdivision thereof is a party to for construction, alteration, demolition or repair or any combination of these, including painting and decorating, of public buildings, public works or public roads of the state and that requires or involves the employment of mechanics, laborers or both shall contain a provision stating the minimum wages and fringe benefits to be paid to various classifications of laborers and mechanics, which shall be based upon the wages and benefits that will be determined by the director to be prevailing for the corresponding classifications of laborers and mechanics employed on contract work of a similar nature in the state or locality, and every contract or project shall contain a stipulation that the contractor, subcontractor, employer or a person acting as a contractor shall pay all mechanics and laborers employed on the site of the project, unconditionally and not less often than once a week and without subsequent unlawful deduction or rebate on any account, the full amounts accrued at time of payment computed at wage rates and fringe benefit rates not less than those determined pursuant to Subsection B of this section to be the prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates issued for the project.\n\nB. Annually, no later than October 1, the director shall determine prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates to take effect the next January 1 for respective classifications of laborers and mechanics employed on public works projects at the same wage rates and fringe benefit rates used in collective bargaining agreements between labor organizations and their signatory employers that govern predominantly similar classifications of laborers and mechanics for the locality of the public works project and the crafts involved; provided that:\n\n(1) if the prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates cannot reasonably and fairly be determined in a locality because no collective bargaining agreements exist, the director shall determine the prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates for the same or most similar classification of laborer or mechanic in the nearest and most similar neighboring locality in which collective bargaining agreements exist;\n\n(2) the director shall give due regard to information obtained during the director's determination of the prevailing wage rates and the prevailing fringe benefit rates made pursuant to this subsection;\n\n(3) any interested person shall have the right to submit to the director written data, personal opinions and arguments supporting changes to the prevailing wage rate and prevailing fringe benefit rate determination;\n\n(4) prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates determined pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be compiled as official records and kept on file in the director's office, and the records shall be updated in accordance with the applicable rates used in subsequent collective bargaining agreements;\n\n(5) an appeal of the prevailing wage determination pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not have the effect of creating a stay of the implementation of the rate; and\n\n(6) during the pendency of an appeal, whether before the labor and industrial commission or in a court, a court of competent jurisdiction may grant a stay of the implementation of the wage rate based on a motion made by a party or an interested person, provided the court gives an opportunity for any interested person to be heard on the matter.\n\nC. The prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates to be paid shall be posted by the contractor or person acting as a contractor in a prominent and easily accessible place at the site of the work; provided that there shall be withheld from the contractor, subcontractor, employer or a person acting as a contractor so much of accrued payments as may be considered necessary by the director or contracting officer of the state or political subdivision to pay to laborers and mechanics employed on the project the difference between the prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates required by the director to be paid to laborers and mechanics on the work and the wage rates and fringe benefit rates received by the laborers and mechanics and not refunded to the contractor, subcontractor, employer or a person acting as a contractor or the contractor's, subcontractor's, employer's or person's agents.\n\nD. Certified weekly payroll records of a contracting agency are subject to inspection pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act [Chapter 14, Article 2 NMSA 1978]; provided that the request shall be fulfilled within twenty days of receipt of the written request.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law applicable to public works contracts or agreements, the director may, with cause:\n\n(1) issue investigative or hearing subpoenas for the production of documents or witnesses pertaining to public works prevailing wage projects; and\n\n(2) attach and prohibit the release of any assurance of payment required under Section 13-4-18 NMSA 1978 for a reasonable period of time beyond the time limits specified in that section until the director satisfactorily resolves any probable cause to believe a violation of the Public Works Minimum Wage Act or its implementing rules has taken place.\n\nF. A person may file with the director a complaint that a contractor, subcontractor, employer or person acting as a contractor on the project has failed to pay the person wages or fringe benefits at the rates required by the Public Works Minimum Wage Act. Within thirty days after the filing of the complaint, either party may request in writing a mediation to resolve the complaint.\n\nG. The director shall, within thirty days of the filing of the complaint, commence an investigation of the allegations contained in the complaint. The director shall, within seventy-five days after the completion of mediation or if no mediation is requested, within seventy-five days after the filing of the complaint, make a determination supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law whether there has been an underpayment of wages or fringe benefits or other violation of the Public Works Minimum Wage Act; provided that if the complaint is of a continuing or significantly complex nature or involves multiple projects or job sites, the director may extend the time in which to make a determination by up to six months by providing written notice and an explanation to all parties of the need to extend the time. Prior to issuing a determination, the director shall provide the contractor, subcontractor, employer or other person against whom the complaint has been filed with an opportunity to respond to the complaint and provide any exculpatory evidence.\n\nH. If the director determines that there has been an underpayment of wages or fringe benefits or a violation of the Public Works Minimum Wage Act, the director shall, in the absence of a voluntary resolution by the parties and within thirty days of making that determination, order the withholding of accrued payments as provided in Subsection C of this section.\n\nI. The director shall issue rules necessary to administer and accomplish the purposes of the Public Works Minimum Wage Act.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 6-6-6, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 35, § 1; 1979, ch. 35, § 1; 1991, ch. 224, § 1; 2005, ch. 253, § 1; 2009, ch. 206, § 3; 2020, ch. 47, § 1; 2022, ch. 5, § 1.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective May 18, 2022, provided that prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates are to be determined annually by October 1 to take effect the next January 1, provided that an appeal of the prevailing wage determination does not stay implementation of the rate, and provided that during the pendency of an appeal, whether before the labor and industrial commission or in a court, a court of competent jurisdiction may grant a stay of the implementation of the wage rate upon motion by a party or an interested person, as long as the court gives an opportunity for any interested person to be heard on the matter; and in Subsection B, in the introductory paragraph, after \"Annually\", added \"no later than October 1\", and after the first occurrence of \"fringe benefit rates\", added \"to take effect the next January 1\", and added Paragraphs B(5) and B(6).\n\nThe 2020 amendment,effective May 20, 2020, provided a process to resolve prevailing wage complaints, and increased penalties; in Subsection A, replaced each occurrence of \"classes\" with \"classifications\"; in Subsection B, in the introductory clause, added \"Annually\", after \"respective\", deleted \"classes\" and added \"classifications\", and deleted \"classes or\" preceding the next occurrence of \"classifications\", in Paragraph B(1), deleted \"class or\" preceding \"classifications\"; in Subsection C, after \"provided that there\", deleted \"may\" and added \"shall\", and after \"considered necessary by the\", added \"director\"; added a new Subsection D and redesignated former Subsection D as Subsection E; and added new Subsections F through H and redesignated the succeeding subsection accordingly.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection A, after \"stating the minimum wages\", added \"and fringe benefits\"; after \"based upon the wages\", added \"and benefits\"; after \"payment computed at wage rates\", added \"and fringe benefit rates\" and after \"not less than those\", deleted \"stated in the minimum wage rates\" and added \"determined pursuant to Subsection B of this section to be the prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates\"; deleted former Subsection B, which provided that the director shall conduct a continuing program for obtaining and compiling wage-rate information; added Subsection B; and in Subsection C, at the beginning of the sentence, deleted \"scale of wages\" and added \"prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates\"; after \"the difference between the\", deleted \"rates of wages\" and added \"prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates\"; and after \"mechanics on the work and the\", changed \"rates received by such laborers\" to \"wage rates and fringe benefit rates received by the laborers\".\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective July 1, 2005, increased the threshold amount of a contract or project from $20,000 to $60,000 in Subsection A and added Subsection D to provide that the director may with cause issue subpoenas for production of documents or witnesses and attach and prohibit the release of any assurance payment until the director resolves any probable cause to believe that a violation has occurred.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective July 1, 1991, substituted \"director of the labor and industrial division of the labor department\" for \"director\" and for \"chief of the labor and industrial bureau\" throughout the section; inserted \"subcontractor, employer or any person acting as a contractor\" following \"contractor\" near the middle of the introductory paragraph and in two places in Subsection B; in the introductory paragraph, substituted \"contract or project\" for \"contract based upon these specifications\" near the middle and \"minimum wage rates issued for the project\" for \"advertised specifications\" at the end; in Subsection B, inserted \"or person acting as a contractor\" near the beginning and substituted \"employed on the project the difference between the rates of wages required by the director of the labor and industrial division of the labor department\" for \"employed by the contractor or subcontractor on the work the difference between the rates of wages required by the contract\" near the middle; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nThe word \"determine\" is synonymous with \"ascertain\".City of Albuquerque v. Burrell, 1958-NMSC-070, 64 N.M. 204, 326 P.2d 1088.\n\nPrivate non-profit corporations.— The standard to be applied when determining whether private non-profit corporations that lease hospitals from government entities meet the definition of \"political subdivision\" under this section is whether under the totality of the circumstances the private entity is so intertwined with a public entity that the private entity becomes an alter ego of the public entity.Memorial Med. Ctr. v. Tatsch Constr., Inc., 2000-NMSC-030, 129 N.M. 677, 12 P.3d 431.\n\nProcurement Code not applicable to non-state fair concession contracts.— Where plaintiff, a for-profit corporation providing dental services, was awarded a contract to provide dental services for Albuquerque public schools (APS) in response to a request for information (RFI) issued by APS, which stated that all services performed per an award for the RFI must be performed at no cost to APS and that successful applicants would be directed to bill medicaid, other third-party payers or provide services pro bono, and where plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory judgment requesting an order declaring that the RFI was subject to the Procurement Code, the district court did not err in dismissing plaintiff's complaint, because APS's RFI falls under the definition of a concession contract, and under the clear language of 13-1-30(A) NMSA 1978, non-state fair concession contracts are not covered by the Procurement Code.Mira Consulting, Inc. v. Board of Educ., 2017-NMCA-009.\n\nSection inapplicable when telecommunication system replaced.— This section did not apply to a contract whereby the telecommunications system in a state university was simply replaced without any construction or alteration of the buildings and when cables were installed in preexisting tunnels.Universal Commc'n Sys. v. Smith, 1986-NMSC-076, 104 N.M. 754, 726 P.2d 1384.\n\nThe director has a nondiscretionary duty to set prevailing wage rates in accordance with collective bargaining agreements.— This section imposes a mandatory, nondiscretionary duty on the director of the labor relations division of the New Mexico department of workforce solutions (director) to set prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates according to collective bargaining agreements for all public works projects costing more than sixty thousand dollars to which the state or any political subdivision is a party. This section also imposes a continuing duty on the director to update the prevailing wage and prevailing benefit rates according to applicable rates used in subsequent collective bargaining agreements.N.M. Bldg. and Constr. Trades Council v. Dean, 2015-NMSC-023.\n\nWhere petitioners, an alliance of craft unions representing the interests of thousands of New Mexico employees working on public works projects throughout the state, sought a writ of mandamus ordering the director of the labor relations division of the New Mexico department of workforce solutions (director) to set prevailing wage and prevailing benefit rates in accordance with the Public Works Minimum Wage Act, §§ 13-4-10 to -17 NMSA 1978, mandamus was proper because 13-4-11 NMSA 1978 imposes a mandatory, nondiscretionary duty on the director to set prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates according to collective bargaining agreements for all public works projects costing more than sixty thousand dollars to which the state or any political subdivision is a party.N.M. Bldg. and Constr. Trades Council v. Dean, 2015-NMSC-023.\n\nSection violated.— Classification of and wage payments to an employee is in violation of this section, when the interpretation and application of standard job classifications and descriptions were not based upon the prevailing wages being paid on contract work of a similar nature to corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics performing the same work as that employee performed.L.H. Lacy Co. v. State Labor & Indus. Comm'n, 1976-NMSC-065, 89 N.M. 563, 555 P.2d 684.\n\nSection resembles Davis-Bacon Act.— The New Mexico statute is practically identical with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C.S. § 276a), and if a contractor was challenging the law the New Mexico supreme court would readily accept the reasoning of the United States supreme court.City of Albuquerque v. Burrell, 1958-NMSC-070, 64 N.M. 204, 326 P.2d 1088.\n\nDuty to determine prevailing ways.— Before promulgation of an order setting the minimum wage scale to be paid on public works a determination must be made of the prevailing wages being paid in a locality for like work.City of Albuquerque v. Burrell, 1958-NMSC-070, 64 N.M. 204, 326 P.2d 1088.\n\nEmployer cannot be ordered to pay additional wages.— This section expressly confers the power to determine the prevailing wage but does grant the power to order an employer to pay the additional wages determined to be due his laborers. If it is determined that a person or firm has failed to pay the prevailing minimum wages, then the certification procedure outlined in Paragraphs [Subsections] A and B of Section 13-4-14 NMSA 1978 must be followed.Grauerholtz v. New Mexico Labor & Indus. Comm'n, 1986-NMSC-071, 104 N.M. 674, 726 P.2d 351.\n\nHealth benefits are part of prevailing wage.— The health benefits provided pursuant to Executive Order No. 2007-49, issued on October 25, 2007, titled \"State of New Mexico Contractor Health Coverage Requirement\", which directs executive branch state agencies that solicit and award contracts after January 1, 2008 to require prospective contractors to offer health care coverage to their New Mexico employees as part of their procurement submittal, is a valid, enforceable contract that may be accounted for as part of the prevailing wage. 2008 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 08-05.\n\nSection preempted.— This act is preempted by the federal government's predetermined wage rate only when the New Mexico rate is lower than that predetermined by the federal government. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-114.\n\nWhen section applies.— When the political subdivision contracts with another entity to carry out public works, the public works minimum wage rates apply. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-100.\n\nWhen section does not apply.— When a school board acts as both the contractor and political subdivision, this section does not apply. One entity cannot contract with itself under this section. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-100.\n\nSubmission of false wage rate data may be perjury or false swearing.1964 Op. Att'y Gen.

The director shall certify to the contracting agency the names of persons or firms the director has found to have failed to pay wages or fringe benefits due employees under the Public Works Minimum Wage Act [13-4-10 to 13-4-17 NMSA 1978] and the amount of arrears. The contracting agency shall pay or cause to be paid to the affected laborers and mechanics, from any accrued payments withheld under the terms of the contract or designated for the project, three times the amount of any wages or fringe benefits found due to the workers pursuant to the Public Works Minimum Wage Act. The director shall, after notice to the affected persons, distribute a list to all departments of the state giving the names of persons or firms the director has found to have willfully violated the Public Works Minimum Wage Act. No contract or project shall be awarded to the persons or firms appearing on this list or to any firm, corporation, partnership or association in which the persons or firms have an interest until three years have elapsed from the date of publication of the list containing the names of the persons or firms. A person to be included on the list to be distributed may appeal the finding of the director as provided in the Public Works Minimum Wage Act.\n\nB. If the accrued payments withheld under the terms of the contract, as mentioned in Subsection A of this section, are insufficient to reimburse all the laborers and mechanics with respect to whom there has been a failure to pay the wages or fringe benefits required pursuant to the Public Works Minimum Wage Act, the laborers and mechanics shall have the right of action or intervention or both against the contractor or person acting as a contractor and the contractor's or person's sureties, conferred by law upon the persons furnishing labor and materials, and, in such proceeding, it shall be no defense that the laborers and mechanics accepted or agreed to less than the required rate of wages or voluntarily made refunds. The director shall refer such matters to the district attorney in the appropriate county, and it is the duty and responsibility of the district attorney to bring civil suit for wages and fringe benefits due and other damages provided for in Subsection C of this section.\n\nC. In the event of an aggregate underpayment of wages or fringe benefits greater than five hundred dollars ($500) to an employee subject to the Public Works Minimum Wage Act or implementing rules, the contractor, subcontractor, employer or a person acting as a contractor responsible for the underpayment shall be liable to any affected employee for three times the amount of the employee's unpaid wages or fringe benefits. In addition, the contractor, subcontractor, employer or person acting as a contractor shall be liable to any affected employee for one hundred dollars ($100) for each calendar day on which a contractor, subcontractor, employer or person acting as a contractor has willfully required or permitted the employee to work in violation of the provisions of the Public Works Minimum Wage Act.\n\nD. In an action brought pursuant to Subsection C of this section, the court shall award, in addition to all other remedies, attorney fees and costs incurred on behalf of an employee adversely affected by a violation of the Public Works Minimum Wage Act by a contractor, subcontractor, employer or person acting as a contractor.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 6-6-8, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 35, § 4; 1991, ch. 224, § 4; 2005, ch. 253, § 3; 2009, ch. 206, § 6; 2020, ch. 47, § 3.\n\nThe 2020 amendment,effective May 20, 2020, increased the penalties for failure to pay required wage rates; in Subsection A, after \"director has found to have\", deleted \"disregarded their obligations to\" and added \"failed to pay wages or fringe benefits due\", and after \"designated for the project\", added \"three times the amount of\"; in Subsection B, after \"fringe benefits due and\", deleted \"liquidated\" and added \"other\"; in Subsection C, after \"In the event of\", deleted \"any violation of\" and added \"an aggregate underpayment of wages or fringe benefits greater than five hundred dollars ($500) to an employee subject to\", after \"a contractor responsible for the\", deleted \"violation\" and added \"underpayment\", after the first occurrence of \"any affected employee for\", added \"three times the amount of\", after the next occurrence of \"any affected employee for\", deleted \"liquidated damages beginning with the first day of covered employment in the sum of\", and after \"willfully required or permitted\", deleted \"an individual laborer or mechanic\" and added \"the employee\"; and in Subsection D, after \"the court\", deleted \"may\" and added \"shall\", and after \"attorney fees and costs\", deleted \"to\" and added \"incurred on behalf of\".\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection A, in the second sentence, after \"any wages\", added \"or fringe benefits\"; in Subsection B, after \"pay the wages\", added \"or fringe benefits\" and in the last sentence, after \"civil suit for wages\", added \"and fringe benefits\"; in Subsection C, after \"employee's unpaid wages\", added \"or fringe benefits\"; and in Subsection D, after \"subcontractor\", changed \"employee\" to \"employer\".\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective July 1, 2005, changed the amount of liquidated damages in Subsection C from $10 to $100 and added Subsection D to provide that the court may award attorney fees and costs to an employee adversely affected by a violation of the Public Works Minimum Wage Act.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective July 1, 1991, substituted \"director of the labor and industrial division of the labor department\" and \"director\" for \"labor commissioner\" and \"commissioner\" throughout the section; in Subsection A, inserted \"or designated for the project\" in the second sentence and \"or project\" in the fourth sentence; in Subsection B, substituted \"as mentioned in Subsection A of this section\" for \"as aforesaid\" and inserted \"or person acting as a contractor\" in the first sentence and substituted \"provided for in Subsection C of this section\" for \"provided herein\" at the end of the Subsection; inserted \"employer or any person acting as a contractor\" in three places in Subsection C; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nDirector cannot order employer to pay additional wages, but must follow certification procedure.— Section 13-4-11 NMSA 1978 expressly confers upon the labor commissioner (now director of the labor and industrial division) the power to determine the prevailing wage for purposes of the Public Works Minimum Wage Act. The commissioner (director) does not have the power to order an employer to pay the additional wages determined to be due his laborers. If the commissioner (director) has determined that a person or firm has failed to pay the prevailing minimum wages, then the certification procedure outlined in Subsections A and B must be followed.Grauerholtz v. New Mexico Labor & Indus. Comm'n, 1986-NMSC-071, 104 N.M. 674, 726 P.2d 351.\n\nPrivate right of action.— Where plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, sued under the Public Works Minimum Wage Act, 13-4-10 to -17 NMSA 1978 (1937, as amended through 2011), alleging that they were not compensated the appropriate wage rate for all hours worked on a renovation project for the university of New Mexico, the district court erred in concluding that the act does not confer a private right of action, because the plain language in Subsections C and D contemplate a private right of action in which an employer can be liable to an employee for unpaid wages and attorney fees, separate from the administrative scheme contained in Subsections A and B, and broadly interpreting the act to imply a private right of action under Subsections C and D would further the remedial purpose of the act, rather than frustrate it.Cates v.

Bd. of Regents, 2014-NMCA-083.\n\nAn illegal provision in a contract may be severed if it is non-essential to an otherwise valid contract.— Where plaintiffs, a class of workers who provided various electrical services on a construction project in which defendants were involved, sued defendants for statutory minimum wage violations, including violation of the Public Works Minimum Wage Act (PWMWA), entered into a settlement agreement with defendants, a condition of which was in violation of federal law regarding income tax and social security withholding for back wages, severance of the non-essential, illegal provision and enforcement of the agreement was the appropriate remedy, because where the purpose and subject matter of a contract are legal, but the contract contains an illegal provision, the general rule is that a court may enforce the valid portions of a contract in favor of a party who has not engaged in serious misconduct if the illegal term is not an essential part of the agreed exchange.Garcia v.

If a contractor fails to deliver the required performance and payment bonds, the contractor's bid shall be rejected, its bid security shall be enforced to the extent of actual damages. Award of the contract shall be made pursuant to the Procurement Code [13-1-28 to 13-1-199 NMSA 1978] in the following manner:\n\n(1) a performance bond satisfactory to the state agency or local public body, executed by a surety company authorized to do business in this state and said surety to be approved in federal circular 570 as published by the United States treasury department or the state board of finance or the local governing authority, in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the price specified in the contract; and\n\n(2) a payment bond satisfactory to the state agency or local public body, executed by a surety company authorized to do business in this state and said surety to be approved in federal circular 570 as published by the United States treasury department or the state board of finance or the local governing authority, in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the price specified in the contract, for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material to the contractor or its subcontractors for the performance of the work provided for in the contract.\n\nB.

The state purchasing agent or the central purchasing office may reduce the amount of the payment bond required prior to solicitation of not less than fifty percent of the contract price if it is determined that it is in the best interest of the state agency or local public body to do so.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nPurpose of Little Miller Act.— The Little Miller Act [13-4-18 to 13-4-20 NMSA 1978] was enacted to protect suppliers of materials under any subcontract involving a state construction project.State ex rel. Elec. Supply Co. v. Kitchens Constr., Inc., 1988-NMSC-013, 106 N.M. 753, 750 P.2d 114.\n\nBond requirements.— The Little Miller Act [(13-4-18 to 13-4-20 NMSA 1978] requires a bond conditioned for the performance and completion of contract according to its terms, in \"compliance with all requirements of law,\" and also for payment of labor and materials and is more encompassing than the federal Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. § 270A.Employment Sec. Comm'n v. C.R. Davis Contracting Co., 1969-NMSC-174, 81 N.M. 23, 462 P.2d 608.\n\nSection gives remedy comparable to mechanic's lien.— Sections 13-4-18 and 13-4-19 NMSA 1978 are intended to provide a remedy comparable to a mechanic's lien to materialmen who provide supplies for a state government construction project.State ex rel. W.M. Carroll & Co. v. K.L. House Constr. Co., 1982-NMSC-150, 99 N.M. 186, 656 P.2d 236.\n\nNot a lien statute.— The Little Miller Act [13-4-18 to 13-4-20 NMSA 1978] is not a lien statute; it merely provides a remedy for recovery of monies due for the doing of work or the furnishing of material on a state construction project.State ex rel. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co. v. KNC, Inc., 1987-NMSC-063, 106 N.M. 140, 740 P.2d 690.\n\nBond required for public highway construction.— This section requires that a bond be given when the state enters into a contract for the construction of a public highway.Am. Sur. Co. v. Gilmore Oil Co., 83 F.2d 249 (10th Cir. 1936).\n\nII. PERSONS AND ENTITIES PROTECTED.\n\nBond inurement.— Under New Mexico law prior to the passage of this act (Laws 1923, ch. 136), a public contractor's bond inured to the benefit of furnishers of labor, material, and supplies to the principal.First Nat'l Bank v. Caples, 17 F.2d 87 (5th Cir. 1927).\n\nPublic also protected.— Bond required of road contractor under this section is not only for protection of laborers and materialmen, but also for the protection of the public in tending to lower prices of labor and material by assuring payment of all claims.Silver v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., 1935-NMSC-098, 40 N.M. 33, 53 P.2d 459.\n\nThird-tier suppliersof materials to government construction projects are entitled to protection under New Mexico's Little Miller Act [13-4-18 to 13-4-20 NMSA 1978].Nichols Corp. v. Bill Stuckman Constr., Inc., 1986-NMSC-077, 105 N.M. 37, 728 P.2d 447.\n\nSection applies to third-tier suppliers.— The Little Miller Act [13-4-18 to 13-4-20 NMSA 1978] applies to suppliers of materials under any subcontract involving a state construction project, including third-tier suppliers.State ex rel. W.M. Carroll & Co. v. K.L. House Constr. Co., 1982-NMSC-150, 99 N.M. 186, 656 P.2d 236.\n\nWhen materialman may sue.— A bond to the state, conditioned for the performance by a highway contractor of the obligation of his contract, one of which obligations is to pay for materials used, may be sued on by a materialman.Southwestern Portland Cement Co. v. Williams, 1926-NMSC-052, 32 N.M. 68, 251 P. 380.\n\nIII. SURETY LIABILITY.\n\nSurety's liability to employee leasing company.— General contractor's surety was liable to employee leasing company which furnished labor for project covered by surety's bond since leasing company hired the laborers, paid them weekly, and then billed general contractor in accordance with the terms of their contract.Eastland Fin. Servs. v. Mendoza, 2002-NMCA-035, 132 N.M. 24, 43 P.3d 375.\n\nExceptions to \"supplies\".— The word \"supplies,\" used in the statute and in a contractor's bond, does not include premiums on workmen's compensation and public liability insurance, and recovery cannot be had against the surety for failure to pay such items.Anderson v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co., 1940-NMSC-054, 44 N.M. 483, 104 P.2d 906.\n\nSurety's liability in absence of bond.— Where surety company signed bond to which the contract was attached, it was bound by the provision in the contract that \"the contractor will give bond guaranteeing the payment of labor and materials\" as required by statute, although such bond was never actually given, and the surety company was liable to the materialman.Southwestern Sash & Door Co. v. Am. Employers' Ins. Co., 1933-NMSC-025, 37 N.M. 212, 20 P.2d 928.\n\nRights of surety.— A surety that issues performance and payment bonds, and then satisfies claims against the contractor by paying laborers and materialmen, has superior rights as against the contractor's secured creditors to final progress payments and retainage funds held by the project owner.New Mexico State Hwy. & Transp. Dep't v. Gulf Ins. Co., 2000-NMCA-007, 128 N.M. 634, 996 P.2d 424.\n\nWhen no release of surety.— Failure of school board to retain 15% of the contract price for a school building from the contractor, until final settlement, does not release the surety from liability to the laborers or materialmen.Southwestern Sash & Door Co. v. Am. Employers' Ins. Co., 1933-NMSC-025, 37 N.M. 212, 20 P.2d 928.\n\nExtension of surety liability.— Although the general rule is that the liability of a surety cannot be extended beyond the fair import of the undertaking in the bond, this rule has certain exceptions: (1) where bonds are given pursuant to statute for a public or quasi-public purpose; or (2) when by special provision of statute the conditions and obligations prescribed in the statute requiring the bond must be read into the bond, whether contained therein or not, and in such cases, the liability of a surety will be determined by the conditions and obligations prescribed in the statute, in the first instance, on principles of public policy, and the second, by force of statutory provision.Employment Sec. Comm'n v. C.R. Davis Contracting Co., 1969-NMSC-174, 81 N.M. 23, 462 P.2d 608.\n\nPunitive damages.— Although statutes requiring the filing of contractor's bonds and the terms of surety bonds, like New Mexico's Little Miller Act, are generally liberally construed to effect legislative intent and the purpose of the bond, clearly the language of the surety bond did not extend to liability for punitive damages.State ex rel. Conley Lott Nichols Mach. Co. v Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., 1983-NMCA-112, 100 N.M. 440, 671 P.2d 1151.\n\nIV. TIME TO SUE.\n\nUnless a governmental entity directly contracts for a shorter time-to-sue provisionwith either the contractor or the surety, a shorter time-to-sue provision contained in a performance bond is unenforceable.City of Santa Fe v. Travelers Casualty & Surety Co., 2010-NMSC-010, 147 N.M. 699, 228 P.3d 483.\n\nEnforceability of time-to-sue provisions in performance bond.— Where a municipality contracted with a contractor to repair a tank; the contract did not contain a time-to-sue provision; the contractor obtained a performance bond from the surety; the performance bond contained a two year time-to-sue provision; the municipality declared the contractor in default and demanded performance from the surety; and the municipality sued the surety more than two years after the municipality declared the default, the two year time-to-sue provision in the performance bond was unenforceable and the six year statute of limitation under Section 37-1-3 NMSA 1978 applied.City of Santa Fe v. Travelers Casualty & Surety Co., 2010-NMSC-010, 147 N.M. 699, 228 P.3d 483.\n\nTimeliness of notice.— Where contractor furnished bond provided for under this section and timely notice was given to contractor's surety only if a substitute item, the last one furnished on the job, was legally sufficient, notice was too late, since contractor had not been informed of the proposed change as required by contract provisions dealing with changes, and the item, never installed, was held not to be the last item furnished under the contract.Crane O'Fallon Co. v. Via, 1952-NMSC-101, 56 N.M. 772, 251 P.2d 260.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"The Miller Act in New Mexico - Materialman's Right to Recover on Prime's Surety Bond in Public Works Contracts - Notice as Condition Precedent to Action,\" see 9 Nat.

      "text": "A. The state shall have the right to sue on the payment bond for all taxes due arising out of construction services rendered under a contract, in respect of which a payment bond is furnished under Section 13-4-18 NMSA 1978 by a contractor that does not have its principal place of business in New Mexico, and to prosecute such action to final execution and judgment for the sum due. The court may allow, as part of the costs, interest and reasonable attorney fees.\n\nB. Every person, firm or corporation that has furnished labor or materials in the prosecution of work provided for in a contract, in respect of which a payment bond is furnished under Section 13-4-18 NMSA 1978, and that has not been paid in full for the labor or materials before the expiration of a period of ninety days after the day on which the last of the labor was done or performed or materials were furnished or supplied for which claim is made, shall have the right to sue on the payment bond for the amount of the balance unpaid at the time of the institution of the suit and to prosecute such action to final execution and judgment for the sum or sums justly due for the labor done or performed or materials furnished to be used in the construction of the project; provided, however, that sums justly due shall be determined according to the subcontract or other contractual relationship directly with the contractor furnishing the payment bond. A person having a direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor but no contractual relationship, express or implied, with the contractor furnishing the payment bond shall have a right of action upon the payment bond upon giving written notice to the contractor, within ninety days from the date on which the person did or performed the last of the labor or furnished or supplied the last of the materials for which the claim is made, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed and the name of the party to whom the materials were furnished or supplied or for whom the labor was done or performed. Notice shall be served by mailing the notice by registered mail, postage prepaid, in an envelope addressed to the contractor at any place the contractor maintains an office or conducts business or at the contractor's residence or in any manner in which the service of summons in civil process is authorized by law.\n\nC. The claimant in the suit shall notify the obligee named in the bond of the beginning of such action, stating the amount claimed, and no judgment shall be entered in the action within thirty days after giving notice. The obligee and any person, firm, corporation or the state having a cause of action on the bond may be admitted on motion as a party to the action, and the court shall determine the rights of all parties thereto. If the amount realized on the bond is insufficient to discharge all claims in full, the amount shall be distributed among the parties entitled thereto pro rata.\n\nD. Except for suits by the state with respect to taxes that shall be brought in the name of the revenue processing division of the taxation and revenue department, every suit instituted under this section shall be brought in the name of the state for the use of the person suing in the district court in any judicial district in which the contract was to be performed and executed or where the claimant resides, but no such suit, including one brought by the revenue processing division, shall be commenced after the expiration of one year after the date of final settlement of the contract. The date of final settlement, for purposes of this section, is that date set by the obligee in the final closing and settlement of payment, if any, due the contractor. The state shall not be liable for the payment of any costs or expenses of any such suit.\n\nE. The obligee named in the bond is authorized and directed to furnish to any person, firm or corporation making application therefor that submits an affidavit that the person, firm or corporation has supplied labor or materials for such work and payment has not been made or that the person, firm or corporation is being sued on any such bond or to furnish to the revenue processing division of the taxation and revenue department a certified copy of the bond and the contract for which it was given, which copy shall be prima facie evidence of the contents, execution and delivery of the original, and, in case final settlement of the contract has been made, a certified statement of the date of such settlement, which shall be conclusive as to such demand upon it. Applicants shall pay for the certified copies and certified statements such fees as the obligee fixes to cover the cost of preparation.\n\nHistory:Laws 1923, ch. 136, § 2; C.S. 1929, § 17-202; 1941 Comp., § 6-512; Laws 1953, ch. 65, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 6-6-12; Laws 1975, ch. 251, § 2; 2015, ch. 109, § 1.\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective June 19, 2015, authorized a court to award costs, including interest and reasonable attorney fees when the state sues for taxes due arising out of construction services rendered under a public works contract, and clarified that a person who has furnished labor or materials under a public works contract and has not been paid in full, may sue for the amount due for the labor performed or materials furnished under the public works contract; added new Subsection A and redesignated the succeeding subsections accordingly; in Subsection B, after \"firm or corporation\", deleted \"who\" and added \"that\", after \"furnished labor or\", deleted \"material\" and added \"materials\", after \"provided for in\", deleted \"such\" and added \"a\", after \"and\", deleted \"who\" and added \"that\", after \"paid in full\", deleted \"therfor\" and added \"for the labor or materials\", after \"labor was done or performed\", deleted \"by him\", after \"or\", deleted \"material was\" and added \"materials were\", after \"furnished or supplied\", deleted \"by him\", after \"for which\", deleted \"such\", after \"claim is made\", deleted \"and the state, in respect of which a payment bond is furnished under Section 13-4-18 NMSA 1978, by a contractor who does not have its principal place of business in New Mexico, for all taxes due arising out of construction services rendered under the contract\", after \"right to sue on\", deleted \"such\" and added \"the\", after \"for the amount of the balance\", deleted \"thereof\", after \"institution of\", deleted \"such\" and added \"the\", after \"sums justly due\", deleted \"him; provided, however, that any\" and added \"for the labor done or performed or materials furnished to be used in the construction of the project; provided, however, that sums justly due shall be determined according to the subcontract or other contractual relationship directly with the contractor furnishing the payment bond.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nLegislative intent.— If no relief is available under this section, the legislature has decreed that the risk of loss must fall on the contractor or subcontractor who undertakes performance of a contract on a state project, rather than on the taxpayers who presumably have already paid all or most of the costs of the project.Hydro Conduit Corp. v. Kemble, 1990-NMSC-061, 110 N.M. 173, 793 P.2d 855 (1990).\n\nStatutory remedy comparable to mechanic's lien.— The public policy behind the Little Miller Act [13-4-18 to 13-4-20 NMSA 1978] is to provide protection for suppliers in the public contracts arena similar to the statutory materialmen's lien.Hasse Constr. Co. v. KBK Fin., Inc., 1999-NMSC-023, 127 N.M. 316, 980 P.2d 641.\n\nSection gives remedy comparable to mechanic's lien.— Sections 13-4-18 and 13-4-19 NMSA 1978 are intended to provide a remedy comparable to a mechanic's lien to materialmen who provide supplies for a state government construction project.State ex rel. W.M. Carroll & Co. v. K.L. House Constr. Co., 1982-NMSC-150, 99 N.M. 186, 656 P.2d 236.\n\nEstoppel as a defense.— Estoppel may be a defense in a Little Miller Act [13-4-18 to 13-4-20 NMSA 1978] case.State ex rel. Electric Supply Co. v. Kitchens Constr., Inc., 1988-NMSC-013, 106 N.M. 753, 750 P.2d 114.\n\nEstoppel.— Supplier was not estopped from pursuing its claim under the Little Miller Act [13-4-18 to 13-4-20 NMSA 1978] against the general contractor and the surety, where the supplier made no affirmation to the general contractor concerning notification of the subcontractor's failure to make payments, and there was no conduct on the supplier's part for the general contractor to have relied on to its detriment.State ex rel. Electric Supply Co. v. Kitchens Constr., Inc., 1988-NMSC-013, 106 N.M. 753, 750 P.2d 114.\n\nSupplemental complaint after one year allowed where not prejudicial.— A district court's decision to allow the filing of a supplemental complaint to eliminate any alleged jurisdictional defects more than one year after the filing of the initial complaint is in keeping with the remedial nature of the statute, where there is no prejudice shown by the filing of the supplemental complaint.State ex rel. Goodmans Office Furnishings, Inc. v. Page & Wirtz Constr. Co., 1984-NMSC-103, 102 N.M. 22, 690 P.2d 1016.\n\nNotice requirement for a workers' compensation insurer's claim of a lien right against a performance bond,given in connection with a state construction project, was governed by the Mechanic's Lien Act, 48-2-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., and not by the Little Miller Act [13-4-18 to 13-4-20 NMSA 1978].State ex rel. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co. v. KNC, Inc., 1987-NMSC-063, 106 N.M. 140, 740 P.2d 690.\n\nBurden of proof.— The supplier of materials does not have the burden to prove that the materials were actually delivered to the project. The supplier is not required to prove anything beyond the fact that it supplied the materials to the subcontractor for and in the prosecution of the work provided for in the construction contract and also supplied the material for the project.State ex rel. Solsbury Hill, LLC v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 2012-NMCA-032, 273 P.3d 1, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-003.\n\nWhere plaintiff showed that plaintiff supplied material to a subcontractor for installation in a municipal construction project; the invoices for which plaintiff asserted its claim were for material for the project; plaintiff supplied material for the project in prosecution of the work provided for in the contract for the project, plaintiff was entitled to recover its claim for unpaid invoices for material supplied on the surety's payment bond even though plaintiff failed to prove that plaintiff actually delivered the material and that the material was actually incorporated into the project.State ex rel. Solsbury Hill, LLC v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 2012-NMCA-032, 273 P.3d 1, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-003.\n\nAttorney fees.— Attorney fees are awardable as a sum or sums justly due under Section 13-4-19 NMSA 1978 where the contract between the subcontractor and supplier provides for an award of attorney fees incurred by the supplier in endeavoring to collect amounts due and unpaid under the supplier's credit agreement with the subcontractor.State ex rel. Solsbury Hill, LLC v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 2012-NMCA-032, 273 P.3d 1, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-003.\n\nII. PERSONS AND ENTITIES PROTECTED.\n\nMaterialman's right to payment on bond.— Prompt payment provision, as incorporated in the subcontractor-supplier contract, provided an adequate basis for the subcontractor to refuse to pay the supplier or its secured creditor and instead pay the materialman who had provided supplies to the supplier.Hasse Constr. Co. v. KBK Fin., Inc., 1999-NMSC-023, 127 N.M. 316, 980 P.2d 641.\n\nSurety's liability to employee leasing company.— General contractor's surety was liable to employee leasing company which furnished labor for project covered by surety's bond since leasing company hired the laborers, paid them weekly, and then billed general contractor in accordance with the terms of their contract.Eastland Fin. Servs. v. Mendoza, 2002-NMCA-035, 132 N.M. 24, 43 P.3d 375.\n\nIII. NOTICE.\n\nGenerally.— The statute is remedial in nature and its principal purpose is to protect the supplier of labor and materials, and it should be liberally construed to effectuate the obvious legislative intent. However, the court cannot, in the guise of liberality, justify completely ignoring the very prerequisite (notice) which the legislature prescribed as a condition precedent to the accrual of any right against the contractor's bond.State ex rel. Komac Paint & Wallpaper Store v. McBride, 1964-NMSC-108, 74 N.M. 233, 392 P.2d 577.\n\nWritten notice is mandatoryas a strict condition precedent to the existence of any right of action upon the payment bond.State ex rel. State Elec. Supply Co. v. McBride, 1968-NMSC-146, 79 N.M. 467, 444 P.2d 978.\n\nPurpose of notice requirement.— The requirement under Subsection A that a claimant give written notice within 90 days is a necessary prerequisite to recovery. This notice requirement acts as a protection against unlimited and unascertainable contingent liabilities.State ex rel. W.M. Carroll & Co. v. K.L. House Constr. Co., 1982-NMSC-150, 99 N.M. 186, 656 P.2d 236.\n\nNotice within 90 days from final performance.— Under express language of this section, identical with that of the Miller Act, the supplier who has no direct contractual relation with the general contractor is given a right of action against the bond only upon compliance with the condition precedent to suit \" 'upon giving written notice to said contractor' within ninety days from the date of final performance.\"State ex rel. Komac Paint & Wallpaper Store v. McBride, 1964-NMSC-108, 74 N.M. 233, 392 P.2d 577.\n\nNotice \"for which such claim is made\".— The statute requires written notice of claim within 90 days of the date the last item of material \"for which such claim is made\" was delivered by the supplier to the subcontractor.State ex rel. State Elec. Supply Co. v. McBride, 1968-NMSC-146, 79 N.M. 467, 444 P.2d 978.\n\nSubstantial compliance with notice required.— The supplier's right of action to recover on the general contractor's bond comes into being only upon substantial compliance with the notice required by the legislature.State ex rel. Komac Paint & Wallpaper Store v. McBride, 1964-NMSC-108, 74 N.M. 233, 392 P.2d 577.\n\nNotice substantially complied with statutory requirements.— Where the supplier of materials for a municipal construction project last supplied material for the project on May 3, 2007; the supplier mailed notices of claim on May 22, 2007 by certified mail to each of the contractor's addresses as reported by the contractor to the New Mexico public regulation commission, as shown by the commission's on-line records; the contractor actually received notice; the amount claimed for material did not include amounts for tools or equipment; and the notice stated that the amounts due were substantially accurate, the supplier substantially complied with the notice requirements of Section 13-4-19 NMSA 1978.State ex rel. Solsbury Hill, LLC v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 2012-NMCA-032, 273 P.3d 1, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-003.\n\nTimeliness of notice.— Supplying an item not called for by plans and specifications or demanded by a change or other authorization or installed as a part of the construction did not provide a basis for determining the last day on which materials were supplied.Crane O'Fallon Co. v. Via, 1952-NMSC-101, 56 N.M. 772, 251 P.2d 260.\n\nTimeliness of notice to obligee.— Where the supplier of material for a municipal construction project filed suit against the surety of the payment bond for the project in September 2007; the supplier mailed notice of its claim on the bond to the municipality in July 2009; and the district court entered a judgment in October 2007, the municipality was not prejudiced, because the judgment had not been entered before the municipality received notice.State ex rel. Solsbury Hill, LLC v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 2012-NMCA-032, 273 P.3d 1, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-003.\n\nEarly notice deemed timely.— A supplier may give adequate notice to a contractor prior to the expiration of the 90-day time limit of Subsection A and may give notice and file suit for nonpayment prior to delivery of the last items to the contractor.State ex rel. Goodmans Office Furnishings, Inc. v. Page & Wirtz Constr. Co., 1984-NMSC-103, 102 N.M. 22, 690 P.2d 1016.\n\nSufficiency of notice.— Acknowledgment of receipt of claim of subcontractor for materials and supplies, under contractor's bond, by state highway department was insufficient notice to surety of such claim.Silver v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., 1935-NMSC-098, 40 N.M. 33, 53 P.2d 459.\n\nIV. AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE.\n\nDamages recoverable.— The Little Miller Act clearly and unequivocally limits recovery against a surety to all just claims for labor performed, and materials and supplies furnished; nothing is said about recovery for loss of profits or \"delay damages,\" and the court would decline to extend the meaning and purpose of the statute any further than the clear language would take it.Herzog Contracting Corp. v. A & S Constr. Co., 1988-NMSC-022, 107 N.M. 6, 751 P.2d 690.\n\nReasonable attorney's fees should be includedin a suit on the bond where the written terms of the contract sued upon expressly provided for the allowance of attorney's fees.State ex rel. Nichols v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., 1983-NMCA-112, 100 N.M. 440, 671 P.2d 1151.\n\nPrejudgment interest.— Where the open account credit agreement between the supplier of materials and a subcontractor on a municipal construction project provided for interest at 18% per year, prejudgment interest was awardable as a sum justly due under Section 13-4-19 NMSA 1978 at the rate of 18% per year against the surety on the payment bond for the project.State ex rel. Solsbury Hill, LLC v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 2012-NMCA-032, 273 P.3d 1, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-003.\n\nSubcontractor who held a judgment against contractor for debt owed under contract could sue contractor's surety for all contract liability under the bond, including amounts representing prejudgment interest, those amounts being \"justly due\" from contractor.State ex rel. Bob Davis Masonry, Inc. v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., 1994-NMSC-106, 118 N.M. 558, 883 P.2d 144.\n\nPost-judgment interest.— Where the open account credit agreement between the supplier of materials and a subcontractor on a municipal construction project provided for interest at 18% per year, post-judgment interest was awardable as a sum justly due under Section 13-4-19 NMSA 1978 at the rate of 18% per year against the surety on the payment bond for the project.State ex rel. Solsbury Hill, LLC v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 2012-NMCA-032, 273 P.3d 1, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-003.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"The Miller Act in New Mexico - Materialman's Right to Recover on Prime's Surety Bond in Public Works Contracts - Notice as Condition Precedent to Action,\" see 9 Nat.
