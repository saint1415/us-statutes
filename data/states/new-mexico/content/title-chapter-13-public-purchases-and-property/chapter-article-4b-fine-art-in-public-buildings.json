      "text": "A. No person except an artist who owns or possesses a work of fine art which the artist has created shall intentionally commit or authorize the intentional commission of any physical defacement, mutilation, alteration or destruction of a work of fine art in public view. As used in this section, \"intentional physical defacement, mutilation, alteration or destruction\" includes any such action taken deliberately or through gross negligence.\n\nB. The artist shall retain the right to claim and receive credit under his own name or under a reasonable pseudonym or, for just and valid reason, to disclaim authorship of his work of fine art. Credit shall be determined in accord with the medium of expression and the nature and extent of the contribution of the artist to the work of fine art.\n\nC. The artist or any bona fide union or other artists' organization authorized in writing by the artist for such purpose may commence an action in district court without having as prerequisites to a suit any need for:\n\n(1) damages already incurred;\n\n(2) a showing of special damages, if any; or\n\n(3) general damages in any monetary amount to recover or obtain any of the following:\n\n(a) injunctive relief or declaratory relief;\n\n(b) actual damages;\n\n(c) reasonable attorneys' and expert witness fees and all other costs of the action; or\n\n(d) any other relief which the court deems proper.\n\nD. In determining whether a work of fine art is of recognized quality, the court shall rely on the opinions of artists, art dealers, collectors of fine art, curators of art museums, restorers and conservators of fine art and other persons involved with the creation or marketing of fine art.\n\nE. The provisions of this section shall, with respect to the artist, or if any artist is deceased, his heir, legatee, or personal representative, continue until the fiftieth anniversary of the death of such artist, and continue in addition to any other rights and duties which may now or in the future be applicable and, except as provided in Subsection F of this section, may not be waived except by an instrument in writing expressly so providing which is signed by the artist and refers to specific works with identification and such waiver shall only apply to work so identified.\n\nThe attorney general may, if the artist is deceased, assert the rights of the artist on the artist's behalf and commence an action for injunctive relief with respect to any work of art which is in public view.\n\nF. If a work of fine art in public view cannot be removed from a building without substantial physical defacement, mutilation, alteration, or destruction of such work, the rights and duties created under this section, unless expressly reserved by an instrument in writing signed by the owner of such building and properly recorded prior to the installation of such art, shall be deemed waived. Such instrument, if recorded, shall be binding on subsequent owners of such building.\n\nG. If the owner of a building wishes to remove a work of fine art which is a part of that building but which can be removed from the building without substantial harm to such fine art, the rights and duties created under this section shall apply unless the owner has diligently attempted without success to notify the artist or, if the artist is deceased, his heir, legatee or personal representative in writing of his intended action affecting the work of fine art, or unless he did provide notice and that person failed within ninety days either to remove the work or to pay for its removal. If such work is removed at the expense of the artist, his heir, legatee or personal representative, title to the fine art shall be deemed to be in such person.\n\nHistory:Laws 1987, ch. 70, § 3.",
