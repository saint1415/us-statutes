      "text": "The purpose of the Construction Industries Licensing Act is to promote the general welfare of the people of New Mexico by providing for the protection of life and property by adopting and enforcing codes and standards for construction, alteration, installation, connection, demolition and repair work. To effect this purpose, it is the intent of the legislature that:\n\nA. examination, licensing and certification of the occupations and trades within the jurisdiction of the Construction Industries Licensing Act be such as to ensure or encourage the highest quality of performance and to require compliance with approved codes and standards and be, to the maximum extent possible, uniform in application, procedure and enforcement;\n\nB. there be eliminated the wasteful and inefficient administrative practices of dual licensing, duplication of inspection, nonuniform classification and examination of closely related trades or occupational activities and jurisdictional conflicts; and\n\nC. contractors be required to furnish and maintain evidence of responsibility.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 67-35-4, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 199, § 4; 1978 Comp., § 60-13-4, recompiled as § 60-13-1.1 by Laws 1989, ch. 6, § 2.\n\nStatutory policy.— The policy of the CILA is best served by imposing proportional liability on general contractors who hire unlicensed independent contractors to do dangerous work requiring a license for foreseeable injuries those independent contractors suffer due to their lack of qualifications. A general contractor who negligently hires an unqualified independent contractor to perform dangerous work may be liable for injuries to that same unqualified independent contractor.Tafoya v. Rael, 2008-NMSC-057, 145 N.M. 4, 193 P.3d 551.\n\nPurpose of this act is to protect the publicfrom incompetent and irresponsible builders, and in view of the severity of the sanctions and the forfeitures which could be involved, courts are reluctant to construe the act more broadly than necessary for achievement of its purpose; its provisions should not be transformed into an \"unwarranted shield for the avoidance of a just obligation.\"Olivas v. Sibco, Inc., 1975-NMSC-027, 87 N.M. 488, 535 P.2d 1339.\n\nAdministrative probable cause and administrative warrant requirements.— Administrative probable cause exists based on either specific evidence of an existing violation or a showing that reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an inspection are satisfied with respect to a particular establishment. The warrant application must inform the judicial officer of the substance of the complaint so that it can determine whether the alleged conditions, if true, constitute a violation.N.M. Construction Indus. Div. v. Cohen, 2019-NMCA-071.\n\nAdministrative search warrant was required.— Where the New Mexico construction industries and manufactured housing division (division) received a written complaint regarding unsafe conditions on respondent's rental property and a written complaint regarding multiple additions that had occurred on the property without the proper permits or inspections, and where the division's inspectors attempted to inspect the property to look for code violations but were denied access by respondent, the district court erred in ordering the division to inspect the property, because although the district court's order found that the division had statutory authority to conduct an inspection, the order lacked a determination of whether probable cause supported an administrative search warrant and no exception to the warrant requirement applied.N.M. Construction Indus. Div. v. Cohen, 2019-NMCA-071.",

1979, ch. 46, § 1; 1979, ch. 49, § 1; 1986, ch. 107, § 1; 1987, ch. 283, § 1; 1989, ch. 6, § 4; 1997, ch. 181, § 2; 1997, ch. 235, § 1; 1999, ch. 130, § 1.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1978, ch. 66, § 1, repealed former 67-35-3, 1953 Comp. (former 60-13-3 NMSA 1978), as amended by Laws 1977, ch. 377, § 1, relating to definition of \"contractor,\" and enacted a new 67-35-3, 1953 Comp.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, added Paragraph D(18); deleted \"but not limited to\" preceding \"constructing\" in Subsection A, preceding \"plumbing fixtures\" in Paragraph D(8), and preceding \"handyman repairs\" in Paragraph D(14); and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nThe 1997 amendments.— Laws 1997, ch. 181, § 2, amending this section effective July 1, 1997 by adding a new Paragraph D(17) relating to persons performing needed repairs or maintenance to commercial property when the total amount paid for a single undertaking does not exceed $5,000, was approved April 10, 1997. However, Laws 1997, ch. 235, § 1, amending this section by adding new Paragraph D(17) relating to weatherization projects not exceeding $2,000, but not giving effect to the changes made by the first 1997 amendment, was approved April 11, 1997. This section was set out as amended by Laws 1997, ch. 235, § 1. See 12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nContractor must have a license.— An individual who qualifies as a contractor under the definition of \"contractor\" in the Construction Industries Licensing Act is required to have a contractor's license when performing the specific acts described in the Construction Industries Licensing Act, regardless of whether the individual can be classified as an employee of a licensed contractor under the common law control test.Reule Sun Corp. v. Valles, 2010-NMSC-004, 147 N.M. 512, 226 P.3d 611,rev'g2008-NMCA-115, 144 N.M. 736, 191 P.3d 1197,overrulingLatta v. Harvey, 1960-NMSC-046, 67 N.M. 72, 352 P.2d 649 andCampbell v. Smith, 1961-NMSC-059, 68 N.M. 373, 362 P.2d 523.\n\nCommon law control test does not apply.— The common law control test for determining whether an individual is an employee does not apply to determine whether an individual is required to have a license under the Construction Industries Licensing Act. An unlicensed contractor's classification as an employee of a licensed contractor under the common law control test does not exempt the unlicensed contractor from the licensing requirements of the Construction Industries Licensing Act.Reule Sun Corp. v. Valles, 2010-NMSC-004, 147 N.M. 512, 226 P.3d 611,rev'g2008-NMCA-115, 144 N.M. 736, 191 P.3d 1197,overrulingLatta v. Harvey, 1960-NMSC-046, 67 N.M. 72, 352 P.2d 649 andCampbell v. Smith, 1961-NMSC-059, 68 N.M. 373, 362 P.2d 523.\n\nFormer Contractors' License Law of 1939 was not unconstitutionalas a denial of due process since the legislature could enact laws in the exercise of its police powers, provided only that the exercise was not so unreasonable as to amount to confiscation of property or a denial of the right to engage in a particular trade, occupation or profession.Kaiser v. Thomson, 1951-NMSC-037, 55 N.M. 270, 232 P.2d 142.\n\nFiling requirement does not bar eligibility for exemption.— The filing requirement in this section is directory, not mandatory, and as such does not to constitute a bar to the plaintiff's eligibility for the intended exemption.Stokes v. Tatman, 1990-NMSC-113, 111 N.M. 188, 803 P.2d 673.\n\n\"Contractor\" status requires control of installation.— The ordering and delivering of materials or the mere arranging for their installation does not bring suppliers of materials into the realm of the definition of \"contractor\" under subsection A where they are not, and their contracts do not place them, in control of the installation.Verchinski v. Klein, 1987-NMSC-003, 105 N.M. 336, 732 P.2d 863.\n\n\"Contractor\" status requires control of employees.— Where an employee leasing contractor that provided construction workers to the general contractor and the general contractor supervised and controlled the workers on the construction site, the employee leasing contractor did not act in the capacity of a contractor.Eastland Fin. Servs. v. Mendoza, 2002-NMCA-035, 132 N.M. 24, 43 P.3d 375.\n\nContractor when promise to mine and move copper ore.— A party who contracts to \"perform certain mining work on copper siliceous ores\" and to \"pay for all labor, work, mining expenses, material, explosives and moving commercial copper ores to specified stockpile location\" is a contractor within the terms of 67-16-2, 1953 Comp. (now repealed).Salter v. Kindom Uranium Corp., 1960-NMSC-040, 67 N.M. 34, 351 P.2d 375.\n\nContractor when no hourly wage, time slips, or employee tax forms.— Defendant was not an employee of the person for whom he had contracted to construct a trailer park, and was therefore required to obtain a contractor's license, where he never received an hourly wage, did not submit time slips or employee tax forms, and the evidence was uncontroverted that the work performed fell within the requirements of Subsection A.Mascarenas v. Jaramillo, 1991-NMSC-014, 111 N.M. 410, 806 P.2d 59.\n\nContracts for \"incidental\" work exempted under former law.— Failure to reemploy the word \"incidental\" in the 1945 amendment did not leave the former Contractors' License Act applicable to contracts for work which was only \"incidental\" to the occupations or pursuits named as being exempted from the act.B. & R. Drilling Co. v. Gardner, 1951-NMSC-004, 55 N.M. 118, 227 P.2d 627.\n\nTest as to independent contractor or employee.— The principal test to determine whether one is an independent contractor or an employee is whether the employer has any control over the manner in which the details of the work are to be accomplished. Mere suggestions by the employer or the \"directing control essential to coordinate the several parts of a larger undertaking\" does not affect the relationship. It is the right to control, not the exercise of it, that furnishes the test.Campbell v. Smith, 1961-NMSC-059, 68 N.M. 373, 362 P.2d 523,overruled on other grounds bySundance Mech. & Util. Corp. v. Atlas, 1990-NMSC-031, 109 N.M. 683, 789 P.2d 1250.\n\nIndependent contractor for assessment work.— Where plaintiff, an expert miner, who was working his adjoining claims was hired to watch defendant's claim and to do defendant's assessment work to consist of 70 feet of tunnel for an agreed price per foot, the details of the work to be left entirely to plaintiff, plaintiff was acting as an independent contractor in the assessment work.Campbell v. Smith, 1961-NMSC-059, 68 N.M. 373, 362 P.2d 523,overruled on other grounds bySundance Mech. & Util. Corp. v. Atlas, 1990-NMSC-031, 109 N.M. 683, 789 P.2d 1250.\n\nRemoval of structures included.— Although the removal of structures is not specifically included within the items named, the section provides that contracting includes the altering of buildings, and altering has some meaning other than constructing, repairing, installing or demolishing; otherwise, all of the words would not have been used in the section.Fleming v. Phelps-Dodge Corp., 1972-NMCA-060, 83 N.M. 715, 496 P.2d 1111.\n\nNeither the asserted contract for removal of a structure from plaintiff's land nor the removal process itself involves building or improving the structures (Subsection D(11)), or building, installations, repairs or alterations on a farm or ranch owned, occupied or operated by plaintiff (Subsection D(12)). Therefore, these exclusions do not exclude the asserted contract of removal from the meaning of \"constructing.\"Fleming v. Phelps-Dodge Corp., 1972-NMCA-060, 83 N.M. 715, 496 P.2d 1111.\n\nNo license required for contract to drill well.— A contract for drilling a well to supply water for agricultural purposes fell within the exceptions to which the former Contractors' License Act of 1939 did not apply.B. & R. Drilling Co. v. Gardner, 1951-NMSC-004, 55 N.M. 118, 227 P.2d 627.\n\nNo license requirement for cleaning activity.— Where construction work had been completed without objection and the only dispute centered around the amount of offset defendant should be allowed as costs for cleaning up the work site, the cleanup activity involved did not require a contractor's license according to the definitions of this section.Olivas v. Sibco, Inc., 1975-NMSC-027, 87 N.M. 488, 535 P.2d 1339.\n\nLicense required in partnership's name.— Contractors' License Law, 67-16-2, 1953 Comp. (now repealed), and the rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto, compelled partnerships to be licensed to hold a license in the partnership name.Crumpacker v. Adams, 1967-NMSC-060, 77 N.M. 633, 426 P.2d 781.\n\nNecessary to establish that license required.— Defendant, seeking to invoke 67-16-14, 1953 Comp. (now repealed), prohibiting an unlicensed contractor from maintaining an action, must establish that plaintiff was in fact required to be licensed.Crumpacker v. Adams, 1967-NMSC-060, 77 N.M. 633, 426 P.2d 781.\n\nEffect of knowledge of other party's lack of license.— Formerly the fact that defendants in an action to establish and foreclose mechanic's lien knew at the time they entered into contract with plaintiff that latter was not duly licensed did not estop them from asserting plaintiff's noncompliance with former licensing statute.Kaiser v. Thomson, 1951-NMSC-037, 55 N.M. 270, 232 P.2d 142.\n\nStanding to attack constitutionality under former law.— Duly licensed contractors operating unmolested under the former act creating the license board (now abolished) were not in position to question constitutionality of the act where no proceeding was pending, contemplated or threatened by the board to revoke their licenses and no other action was contemplated by the board which would affect them adversely.Brockman v. Contractors Licensing Bd., 1944-NMSC-038, 48 N.M. 304, 150 P.2d 125.\n\nHighway contractors are included within definition of term \"contractor\"as used in the former Contractors' License Law. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-69.\n\nHourly worker not necessarily exempt.— The fact that a person undertakes to do work for another at an hourly rate does not necessarily by that fact alone exempt him from the definition of \"contractor\" under former law. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6332.\n\nConstruction for own use on own land not included.— Under former version of this section (67-16-2, 1953 Comp.), a person constructing billboards for his own use on his own land did not need to be licensed as a contractor, as such person did not \"undertake\" to construct, alter, repair, add to or improve anything within the meaning of that section. \"Undertakes\" as used in the statutory definition of \"contractor,\" necessarily meant \"undertakes with another,\" and did not include work done by a person alone for his own uses. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-24.\n\nBowling alley, related fixtures subject to regulation.— Bowling alleys and fixtures related thereto, as in the installation of a bar, are fabricated into a building under a performance contract and for a lump sum and are not considered to be personalty; therefore, the operation in question is subject to regulation under the former act. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-155.\n\nMere moving of completed structure is not included under lawsapplied to contractors' licensing. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5653.\n\nWhen completion and moving of house included.— In the event a house had been wholly constructed elsewhere and moved to the site, the person so moving and setting the house upon the site was not within the provisions of the Contractors' Licensing Law (now repealed). In the event the prefabrication took place in sections and the house or structure was completed on the site, then the persons completing it, if all the other provisions of the law were applicable were under the former law pertaining to the contractors' licensing board (now abolished). 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5653.\n\nSale of prefabricated structure not included.— In view of the rule requiring strict interpretation of licensing statutes, a person who sells prefabricated structures is in no way included in the terms and provisions of the former Contractors' Licensing Law, whether he sells the structure delivered on the building site or whether the structure is sold F.O.B. manufacturer's plant. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5653.\n\nInstallation of turbine water well pump.— A person who installs a turbine water well pump need not obtain a contractor's license. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-28.\n\nProspect and contract miners not subject to act.— Generally speaking, the term \"project\" is not specifically applicable to prospect or development mining operations, but more recognizable as used in commercial or domestic realty terminology; accordingly, under former law, prospect and contract miners were not subject to this act. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-105.\n\nAgency or political subdivision of state not covered under former law.— Under former 67-16-3, 1953 Comp. of the Contractors' License Law, an agency or political subdivision of the state was not required to have a contractor's license for any classification as set forth in the rules and regulations of that law. That section confined the necessity for securing licenses to \"any person, firm, co-partnership, corporation, association or other organization, or any combination thereof.\" Neither the state, its agencies or political subdivisions were mentioned in this list of business entities. Furthermore, the state could not be included in any of such business entities because the state was a body politic and not an association, society or corporation. Thus, the contractors' license board (now abolished) had no authority to license a water or soil conservation district in New Mexico. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-48.\n\nAm.

The contractor, if he has not previously been issued a license, shall upon becoming the apparent successful bidder apply to the division for a license. The director shall issue a license to the contractor in accordance with the provisions of the Construction Industries Licensing Act.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 67-35-15, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 199, § 15; 1969, ch. 224, § 5; 1977, ch. 245, § 174; 1983, ch. 105, § 5; 1989, ch. 6, § 11.\n\nContractor must have a license.— An individual who qualifies as a contractor under the definition of \"contractor\" in the Construction Industries Licensing Act is required to have a contractor's license when performing the specific acts described in the Construction Industries Licensing Act, regardless of whether the individual can be classified as an employee of a licensed contractor under the common law control test.Reule Sun Corp. v. Valles, 2010-NMSC-004, 147 N.M. 512, 226 P.3d 611,rev'g2008-NMCA-115, 144 N.M. 736, 191 P.3d 1197,overrulingLatta v. Harvey, 1960-NMSC-046, 67 N.M. 72, 352 P.2d 649 andCampbell v. Smith, 1961-NMSC-059, 68 N.M. 373, 362 P.2d 523.\n\nCommon law control test does not apply.— The common law control test for determining whether an individual is an employee does not apply to determine whether an individual is required to have a license under the Construction Industries Licensing Act. An unlicensed contractor's classification as an employee of a licensed contractor under the common law control test does not exempt the unlicensed contractor from the licensing requirements of the Construction Industries Licensing Act.Reule Sun Corp. v. Valles, 2010-NMSC-004, 147 N.M. 512, 226 P.3d 611,rev'g2008-NMCA-115, 144 N.M. 736, 191 P.3d 1197,overrulingLatta v. Harvey, 1960-NMSC-046, 67 N.M. 72, 352 P.2d 649 andCampbell v. Smith, 1961-NMSC-059, 68 N.M. 373, 362 P.2d 523.\n\nConstruction work performed by an employee contractor.— Where a licensed general contractor employed an unlicensed individual to stucco defendants' home; the general contractor did not pay the individual a salary, but on a contract-to-contract basis; the general contractor did not withhold taxes from the individual's compensation; the individual had tax identification numbers and paid the individual's own taxes; and the individual performed the work under the complete direction and control of the general contractor, the individual was a contractor under the Construction Industries Licensing Act and was required to possess a contractor's license to perform the work.Reule Sun Corp. v. Valles, 2010-NMSC-004, 147 N.M. 512, 226 P.3d 611,rev'g2008-NMCA-115, 144 N.M. 736, 191 P.3d 1197,overrulingLatta v. Harvey, 1960-NMSC-046, 67 N.M. 72, 352 P.2d 649 andCampbell v. Smith, 1961-NMSC-059, 68 N.M. 373, 362 P.2d 523.\n\nPurpose.— The purpose of the former Contractors' License Law was to require licensing of those engaged in the contracting business to protect the public from unqualified contractors.Cancienne, Inc. v. Southwest Cmty. Inns, Inc., 1969-NMSC-110, 80 N.M. 512, 458 P.2d 587.\n\nLicensed contractors only.— Reading the Procurement Code, Section 13-1-28 NMSA 1978 et seq., and the Construction Industries Licensing Act, Chapter 60, Article 13 NMSA 1978, together, it is clear that the legislature intended (1) that public contracts should be awarded only to licensed contractors and (2) that purchasing authorities should be relieved from the necessity of making an independent investigation into the qualifications and fiscal responsibility of a contractor who is not licensed at the time of bidding. Thus, the doctrine of substantial compliance does not apply to the requirement of Section 60-13-12B NMSA 1978 that a contractor have a valid license when submitting a bid on a public contract.BC&L Pavement Servs., Inc. v. Higgins, 2002-NMCA-087, 132 N.M. 490, 51 P.3d 533.\n\nTransfer of license between contractor and subcontractor prohibited.— This article requires both a contractor and subcontractor to be licensed and prohibits transferring a license or certificate of qualification to another.State v. Jenkins, 1989-NMCA-044, 108 N.M. 669, 777 P.2d 908.\n\nHaving an electrical contractor's license did not exempt partyfrom requirements of the former Contractors' License Law. An action is barred under 67-16-14, 1953 Comp. (now repealed), because of the lack of a contractor's license.Chavas v. Esper, 1966-NMSC-169, 76 N.M. 666, 417 P.2d 802.\n\nLicense required in partnership name.— Former Contractors' License Law (67-16-1, 1953 Comp. et seq.) (now repealed), and the rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto, compel partnerships required to be licensed to hold a license in the partnership name.Crumpacker v. Adams, 1967-NMSC-060, 77 N.M. 633, 426 P.2d 781.\n\nThe admission of a person as a partner with a licensed contractor required the issuance of a new contractor's license to the partnership under former law.Nickels v. Walker, 1964-NMSC-177, 74 N.M. 545, 395 P.2d 679.\n\nType of work to be covered by license.— No person shall engage in business of a contractor unless the construction industries commission (division) has issued him a license which covers the type of work to be undertaken.Peck v. Ives, 1972-NMSC-053, 84 N.M. 62, 499 P.2d 684.\n\nWork done within ambit of party's license.— Defendant's contention that plaintiff's action was barred by 67-16-6 and 67-16-17 1953 Comp. (now repealed), for failure of plaintiff to have contractor's license to perform the work he did was without merit, as plaintiff had a contractor's license which authorized him to do excavating, trenching, welding, water supply, sewage, including disposal and gas lines and the work done involved the cutting and threading of steel braces and welding said braces to steel plates, which fell within that part of plaintiff's contractor's license which authorized plaintiff to contract welding work.Dunson Contractors v. Koury, 1966-NMSC-138, 76 N.M. 723, 418 P.2d 66.\n\nContractor when promise to mine and move copper ore.— A party who contracts to \"perform certain mining work on copper siliceous ores\" and to \"pay for all labor, work, mining expenses, material, explosives and moving commercial copper ores to specified stockpile location\" is a contractor within the terms of 67-16-3, 1953 Comp. (now repealed).Salter v. Kindom Uranium Corp., 1960-NMSC-040, 67 N.M. 34, 351 P.2d 375.\n\nEmployee, not independent contractor, when performance controlled.— Where plaintiff was hired by defendant for drilling purposes, and where defendant retained at all times right of control of performance of the work as well as right to direct manner in which the work would be done, the plaintiff was an employee, not an independent contractor and was not barred from recovery under 67-16-3 and 67-16-14, 1953 Comp. (now repealed), for failure to obtain a contractor's license.Latta v. Harvey, 1960-NMSC-046, 67 N.M. 72, 352 P.2d 649.\n\nAgent not personally liable for principal.— This act does not alter the general rule that an agent is not liable on a contract the agent enters into on behalf of a disclosed principal, even if the principal does not possess a contractor's license and the agent does.Kreischer v. Armijo, 1994-NMCA-118, 118 N.M. 671, 884 P.2d 827.\n\nLicense required maintenance of contract breach action.— Where the work performed was fabricating materials or supplies or using the same in the performance of contracting work and electrical installation, a contractor's license was required under former Contractors' License Law and therefore plaintiff could not maintain an action for breach of contract.Cancienne, Inc. v. Southwest Cmty. Inns, Inc., 1969-NMSC-110, 80 N.M. 512, 458 P.2d 587.\n\nEstablishment of necessity for license required before action barred.— Defendant, seeking to prohibit an unlicensed contractor from maintaining an action, was required to establish that plaintiff was required by 67-16-2, 1953 Comp. (now repealed), to be licensed.Crumpacker v. Adams, 1967-NMSC-060, 77 N.M. 633, 426 P.2d 781.\n\nNo quantum meruit recovery where license required.— One who has shown himself to be required to have contractor's license cannot recover under quantum meruit in absence of such license.Campbell v. Smith, 1961-NMSC-059, 68 N.M. 373, 362 P.2d 523,overruled on other grounds bySundance Mech. & Util. Corp. v. Atlas, 1990-NMSC-031, 109 N.M. 683, 789 P.2d 1250.\n\nAllegation of contractor's license treated as tried with parties' consent.— Where appellants made no objection to evidence of contractor's license and raised neither the jurisdiction nor the limitation question at trial, and requested no findings on either question, requirement of allegation of contractor's license was matter of public policy and did not, otherwise, bear any relation to the cause of action; and appellant cannot object to appellate court treating issue tried with consent of the parties as though it had been raised by pleadings.Daughtrey v. Carpenter, 1970-NMSC-151, 82 N.M. 173, 477 P.2d 807.\n\nEvidence as to license.— Evidence of certain receipts and decals issued by licensing authority to plaintiff, along with plaintiff's own testimony that he was licensed, constitutes acceptable evidence, especially when it is joined with testimony from an official of the New Mexico construction industries commission (division), the agency which now licenses contractors, that plaintiff had been licensed at all pertinent times.Kennedy v. Lynch, 1973-NMSC-085, 85 N.M. 479, 513 P.2d 1261.\n\n\"Best evidence rule\" not applicable to proof of license.— It is plaintiff's licensed status which must be proved and not contents of particular document; therefore, \"best evidence rule\" or Rule 1002, N.M.R. Evid. (now see Rule 11-1002), does not apply.Kennedy v. Lynch, 1973-NMSC-085, 85 N.M. 479, 513 P.2d 1261.\n\nSame person shall not be designated as supervisorin more than one electrical contractor's license. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-77.\n\nUse of unlicensed persons for plumbing and irrigating systems.— Under former law, the New Mexico school for the deaf could employ unlicensed persons for making installation of plumbing in the buildings of a dairy farm located in an unpopulated area; also, an irrigating system could be installed without regard to the licensing requirements of 67-22-2, 1953 Comp., and connections could be made to water tanks, troughs, etc., by licensed plumbers. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-61.\n\nMunicipality's licensing and regulating rights taken away.— Right of a municipality to both license and regulate resident and nonresident contractors has been taken away by the comprehensive nature of the Construction Industries Licensing Act except in certain minor respects. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-72.\n\nPrior contractors', etc., licenses supplanted.— The Construction Industries Licensing Act provides for issuance of a contractor's license which supplants all prior contractors', plumbers' and electricians' licenses. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-72.\n\nRequirements of electrical contractor's license under former law.— When a business, regardless of the nature of its organization (partnership, corporation, etc.) is formed with the intention of entering into the electrical contracting business, it should obtain an electrical contractor's license by written application stating the name of the business designated as holder and the qualified person named as supervisor. The supervisor must be the master electrician. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-77.\n\nPersons, etc., contracting on percentage basis covered by former law.— The contractors' license board (now abolished) could license persons, firms, partnerships and corporations that were contractors on a percentage basis and otherwise were within the coverage of 67-16-2, 1953 Comp. (now repealed). Agents and employees of contractors needed no license, even though they were employed on a percentage basis. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-04.\n\nSalesmen taking orders for remodelingon behalf of licensed building concerns were not required to be licensed by the contractors' license board (now abolished). 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-04.\n\nSpecial license not required for general contractor.— A general contractor for construction of homes and other buildings, but who was not specially licensed as a painter or decorator contractor, was not required by 67-16-17, 1953 Comp. (now repealed), to subcontract the painting and decorating, as his license as a general contractor enabled him to do the painting or hire help to do it for him. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-67.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Constitutional Limitations on the Exercise of Judicial Functions by Administrative Agencies,\" see 7 Nat. Resources J. 599 (1972).\n\nAm.

An unlicensed contractor who has performed unlicensed work may settle the claims against him without becoming licensed if the claims arise from his first offense and he pays an administrative fee calculated pursuant to Paragraph (1) of Subsection D of this section. In addition to the administrative fee, an additional ten percent of the amount of the administrative fee shall be assessed as a service fee.\n\nF.

An occasional or isolated act of this type by an agent of a foreign corporation is obviously not a part of the continuous, usual and ordinary business of the corporation which, in this case, would be building or construction. A foreign corporation must do something in addition to merely designating a statutory agent for service in order to meet the requirement of \"maintaining an office.\" 1962 Op. Att'y Gen.

D.N.M. 2006).\n\nNotice of contemplated action sufficient.— The notice of contemplated action in this case was sufficient to provide the licensee with notice, even though it did not state that the qualifying party certificate was in jeopardy; the licensee knew the general nature of the proceedings against him and that is all that notice pleading requires. Further, the licensee waived the lack of notice issue by appearing at the administrative hearing and defending on the merits.Oden v. State, Regulation & Licensing Dep't, 1996-NMSC-022, 121 N.M. 670, 916 P.2d 1337.\n\nContractor's fiduciary capacity imposed by law binding on him.— Fiduciary capacity of contractor who was advanced money pursuant to construction contracts was imposed by law, rather than implied by law, and existed independent of any express understanding he had with the owner governing the same obligation. Since obtaining state license by contractor is prerequisite to entering construction industry in New Mexico, obligation and duties imposed under this section were binding upon contractor prior to any dealings he had with the owner, and a bankruptcy court's finding that the contractor was acting in a fiduciary capacity within the meaning of federal bankruptcy law, is not clearly erroneous.In re Romero, 535 F.2d 618 (10th Cir. 1976).\n\nThis section imposes fiduciary duty upon contractors who have been advanced money pursuant to construction contracts.In re Romero, 535 F.2d 618 (10th Cir. 1976).\n\nAm.

Phelps-Dodge Corp., 1972-NMCA-060, 83 N.M. 715, 496 P.2d 1111.\n\nUnlicensed contractor should not be able to recover for the fabrication of his clients' cabinets and countertops in light of the fact that, under his view of the agreement, he did not charge anything for installation, because under his legal theory, contractor is in effect asking the court to excuse the construction work he performed without a license and exempt him from the requirements of the Construction Industries Licensing Act.Gamboa v. Urena, 2004-NMCA-053, 135 N.M. 515, 90 P.3d 534, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-005, 135 N.M. 565, 92 P.3d 10.\n\nWhen recovery prohibited.— The statute only prohibits an unlicensed contractor from bringing or maintaining an action \"for the collection of compensation\" for construction work, and therefore, recovery by cross-plaintiff was prohibited only if its action on note and mortgage was one for collection of compensation for a construction contract.Institute for Essential Hous., Inc. v. Keith, 1966-NMSC-067, 76 N.M. 492, 416 P.2d 157.\n\nTo establish that plaintiff is precluded from recoveryby this section requires proof that cabinets were \"fabricated\" into the structure within the meaning of 60-13-3C(1) NMSA 1978 (now see 60-13-3D(1) NMSA 1978).American Builders Supply Corp. v. Enchanted Builders, Inc., 1972-NMSC-012, 83 N.M. 503, 494 P.2d 165.\n\nRecipient of work can recover payments madeon a contract to an unlicensed contractor.Mascarenas v. Jaramillo, 1991-NMSC-014, 111 N.M. 410, 806 P.2d 59.\n\nNo license requirement for cleanup activity.— When construction work had been completed without objection and the only dispute centered around the amount of offset defendant should be allowed as costs for cleaning up the work site, the cleanup activity involved did not require a contractor's license according to the definitions of 60-13-3 NMSA 1978 and was therefore not governed by this section.Olivas v. Sibco, Inc., 1975-NMSC-027, 87 N.M. 488, 535 P.2d 1339.\n\nSubstantial compliance with licensing requirement.— The doctrine of substantial compliance developed in California, which has a licensing act similar to that of New Mexico, is applicable in New Mexico. The three elements of substantial compliance are: (1) appellant held a valid license at the time of contracting; (2) appellant readily secured a renewal of his license; and (3) the responsibility and competence of plaintiff's managing officer were officially confirmed throughout period of performance of contract.Peck v. Ives, 1972-NMSC-053, 84 N.M. 62, 499 P.2d 684.\n\nSince appellant has violated provisions of the act as to aggregate dollar amount of contract for which he is financially responsible at any one time, and thus taken himself out of the duly licensed category, he has \"substantially complied\" with the licensing requirements to such a degree that he is not barred from bringing suit.Peck v. Ives, 1972-NMSC-053, 84 N.M. 62, 499 P.2d 684.\n\nA contractor was in substantial compliance with the act, despite an inadvertent lapse in his license prior to entering into and performing a construction contract; the cancellation of his license occurred for reasons beyond his control and not for reasons of incompetence or discipline, the contractor readily secured a renewal of his license, and the contractor exhibited fiscal responsibility and competence by complying immediately upon becoming aware of the default.Koehler v. Donnelly, 1992-NMSC-058, 114 N.M. 363, 838 P.2d 980.\n\nNo substantial compliance.— Subcontractor did not \"substantially comply\" with licensing requirements to the degree necessary to avoid being barred under this section from bringing suit where he was not licensed at the time he entered into the contract, his efforts to secure a new license when his performance under the subcontract was near completion did not constitute the securing of a \"renewal\" of his license, and his efforts to secure a license did not confirm his responsibility and competence throughout the period of performance.Roth v. Thompson, 1992-NMSC-011, 113 N.M. 331, 825 P.2d 1241.\n\nParty mining copper ore considered contractor.— A party who contracts to \"perform certain mining work on copper siliceous ores\" and to \"pay for all labor, work, mining expenses, material, explosives and moving commercial copper ores to specified stockpile location\" is contractor within the terms of this section.Salter v. Kindom Uranium Corp., 1960-NMSC-040, 67 N.M. 34, 351 P.2d 375.\n\nEmployee not independent contractor where performance controlled.— Since plaintiff was hired by defendant for drilling purposes, and since defendant retained at all times the right of control of performance of work as well as the right to direct manner in which the work would be done, the plaintiff was an employee, not an independent contractor, and was not barred from recovery under this act for failure to obtain contractor's license.Latta v. Harvey, 1960-NMSC-046, 67 N.M. 72, 352 P.2d 649.\n\nEffect of knowledge contractor not licensed.— Under former law, fact that defendants in action to establish and foreclose mechanic's lien knew at the time they entered into contract with plaintiff that latter was not duly licensed did not estop them from asserting plaintiff's noncompliance with the statute.Kaiser v. Thomson, 1951-NMSC-037, 55 N.M. 270, 232 P.2d 142.\n\nAllegation required that contractor duly licensed.— Former law required allegation that contractor was duly licensed at time cause of action arose.Kaiser v. Thomson, 1951-NMSC-037, 55 N.M. 270, 232 P.2d 142.\n\nRaising issue of noncompliance with licensing requirements.— If a complaint on its face shows that compliance with requirement that a contractor be licensed is essential to cause of action, the issue of noncompliance may be raised and dealt with as a matter of law.American Builders Supply Corp. v. Enchanted Bldrs., Inc., 1972-NMSC-012, 83 N.M. 503, 494 P.2d 165.\n\nFailure to allege license is affirmative defense.— The defense of failure to allege license under the statute is affirmative in nature, and should be pleaded.American Builders Supply Corp. v. Enchanted Bldrs., Inc., 1972-NMSC-012, 83 N.M. 503, 494 P.2d 165.\n\nFailure to allege license is equivalent to failure to state claim.— Since failure to allege license under the act is fatal to complaint, it may be asserted at any time that complaint fails to state claim on which relief can be granted. American Builders Supply Corp. v. Enchanted Bldrs., Inc., 1972-NMSC-012, 83 N.M. 503, 494 P.2d 165.\n\nEvidence of license treated as tried by parties' consent.— Where appellants made no objection to evidence of contractor's license and raised neither jurisdiction nor limitation question at trial, and requested no findings on either question, the requirement of allegation of a contractor's license was a matter of public policy and did not, otherwise, bear any relation to the cause of action; and appellant cannot object to appellate court treating issue tried with consent of the parties as though it had been raised by the pleadings.Daughtrey v. Carpenter, 1970-NMSC-151, 82 N.M. 173, 477 P.2d 807.\n\nDefault judgment on crossclaim.— Subcontractor's failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted by alleging in his crossclaim that he was duly licensed as a contractor did not deprive the district court of jurisdiction to enter a default judgment on the crossclaim.Sundance Mech. & Util. Corp. v. Atlas, 1990-NMSC-031, 109 N.M. 683, 789 P.2d 1250.\n\nAm.

A person shall not engage in the occupation or trade of journeyman unless he holds a certificate of competence issued by the division for the occupation or trade in which he desires to engage.\n\nB. The categories for certificates of competence are: journeyman electrician, journeyman plumber, journeyman gas fitter, journeyman pipe fitter, journeyman sheet metal worker, journeyman boiler operator, residential wireman and journeyman welder working on pipelines, collection lines or compressor stations.\n\nC. An applicant for a certificate of competence shall be required to take an examination approved and adopted by the division as to his knowledge of the orders and rules governing the occupation or trade for which a certificate is sought, and as to his technical knowledge and ability pertaining to his particular trade. The examination may be oral, written or demonstrative or any combination thereof, as required by rules of the commission.\n\nD. The division shall issue a certificate of competence to any journeyman welder working on pipelines, collection lines or compressor stations who shows evidence of having satisfactorily completed an examination administered by an independent testing organization or public utility employing engineers registered with the state, such examination meeting the minimum pipeline safety standards set by the public regulation commission.\n\nE. Applications for certificates of competence shall be in the form and shall contain such information and attachments as the division prescribes.\n\nF. The division shall establish a reasonable fee for any examination or issuance of certificate of competence.\n\nG. A person is not eligible to take an examination for a certificate of competence unless he has had two years' experience in the occupation or trade for which a certificate of competence is sought, or the equivalent thereof as determined by the commission, or has successfully completed a course in the trade approved by the vocational education division of the state department of public education.\n\nH. Employment of an apprentice working under the direct supervision of a certified journeyman is not prohibited by the Construction Industries Licensing Act.\n\nI. A person is eligible to take an examination for a journeyman electrician certificate of competence after at least:\n\n(1) four years of accredited training in the electrical trade;\n\n(2) four years of apprenticeship in the electrical trade;\n\n(3) four years of practical experience in the electrical trade, of which two years are in the commercial trade, industrial trade or the equivalent as determined by the commission; or\n\n(4) successfully completing an electrical trade program approved by the vocational education division of the state department of public education and two years of practical experience in the commercial electrical trade.\n\nJ.

An application for renewal that is not accompanied by proof of completion of the continuing education requirements is incomplete and shall not be processed. The continuing education requirements in this subsection shall only apply to a journeyman electrician with the designation \"EE-98J\" or \"JE98\". This does not apply to EE98.\n\nL.

If a permit has been issued for construction of a new residential building, that residential building shall not be occupied until a certificate of occupancy has been issued certifying compliance with all codes and standards.\n\nD. The commission shall make rules and regulations pertaining to the issuance of permits and the setting of reasonable fees to be paid by the applicant for a permit. The regulations shall provide a procedure for the issuance of permits outside the corporate limits of a municipality where inspection is made by a state inspector or a municipal inspector serving as a part-time state inspector and for inspections within a municipality where the inspection is done exclusively by a full-time state inspector. Each trade bureau by regulation may require a reasonable bond or surety in the penal sum of five hundred dollars ($500) or more, but not to exceed fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500), with such bureau named as obligee and conditioned for the payment of inspection fees provided in the Construction Industries Licensing Act. Nothing in this section shall preclude municipalities from making inspections in accordance with the Construction Industries Licensing Act or rules and regulations pursuant to that act or from establishing a schedule of fees to be paid by an applicant for a permit.\n\nE.

Sweazea, 1968-NMCA-008, 78 N.M. 781, 438 P.2d 525.\n\nRestrictions on municipal permitting or inspection.— The construction industries division of the regulation and licensing department does not have the authority to place special requirements on a local jurisdiction's approval of construction permits or inspection of construction projects. 2011 Op. Att'y Gen. 11-06\n\nFailure to adopt temporary or permanent CID program requirements.— The construction industries division of the regulation and licensing department does not have the authority to refuse inspection services to a local jurisdiction because the local jurisdiction failed to adopt temporary or permanent CID program requirements for the approval of construction permits or inspection of construction projects. 2011 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 11-06.\n\n\"Permit\" as used in this sectionrefers to a \"building permit\" or \"installation permit.\" 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-72.\n\nMunicipalities and trade boards not given coextensive authority.— It is unreasonable to interpret this section as giving municipalities and trade boards coextensive authority to require permits and inspections within municipalities. That interpretation would produce the possibility that citizens of a municipality might have to obtain two permits and submit to double inspections for their construction work, which would be contrary to purposes of the Construction Industries Licensing Act, one of which is to eliminate duplication of inspections. 1974 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 74-13.\n\nConstruction Industries Licensing Act covers practically entire field of construction industryand leaves municipalities only the right to make inspections or rules and regulations pursuant thereto, and to establish a schedule of fees to be paid by applicant for a permit. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-72.\n\nRight of municipality to both license and regulate resident and nonresident contractors has been taken away by the comprehensive nature of the Construction Industries Licensing Act except in certain minor respects. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-72.\n\nMunicipality's power to tax contractors.— Legislature intended all occupations should be taxed under former Section 3-38-3 NMSA 1978, and the mere fact they are not included in suggested classifications which a municipality could choose to use does not prevent taxation of resident or nonresident contractors with a minimum tax of $5.00 and a maximum of $25.00 for an occupation license, unless municipality has issued a license to a contractor under any other law. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-72.\n\nMunicipality's power to enact rules, make inspections.— All municipalities have power to enact rules and regulations and make inspections pursuant to the Construction Industries Licensing Act, and charge for building or installation permits, but can add no requirements whatsoever thereto, except possibly as to character and quality of installations, and even this admits of some doubt, if the work passes state inspection. 1969 Op.
