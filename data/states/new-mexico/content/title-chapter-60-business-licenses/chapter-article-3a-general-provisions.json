      "text": "Chapter 60, Articles 3A, 5A, 6A, 6B, 6C, 6E, 7A, 7B and 8A NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Liquor Control Act\".\n\nHistory:Laws 1981, ch. 39, § 1; 1984, ch. 85, § 9; 2015, ch. 3, § 27; 2015, ch. 102, § 1.\n\n2015 Multiple Amendments.— Laws 2015, ch. 3, § 27 and Laws 2015, ch. 102, § 1 enacted different amendments to this section that can be reconciled. Pursuant to 12-1-8 NMSA 1978, Laws 2015, ch. 102, § 1, as the last act signed by the governor is set out above and incorporates both amendments. The amendments enacted by Laws 2015, ch. 3, § 27 and Laws 2015, ch. 102, § 1 are described below. To view the session laws in their entirety,seethe XX session laws onNMOneSource.com.\n\nThe nature of the difference between the amendments is that Laws 2015, ch. 3, § 27 deleted references to Articles 4B and 4C while Laws 2015, ch. 102, § 1 only deleted the reference to Article 4C.\n\nLaws 2015, ch. 102, § 1,effective July 1, 2015, moved \"Chapter 60\" to the beginning of the sentence; after \"4B\", deleted \"4C\"; and after \"6C\", added \"6E\".\n\nLaws 2015, ch. 3, § 27,effective July 1, 2015, moved \"Chapter 60\" to the beginning of the sentence; after \"Articles 3A\", deleted \"4B, 4C\"; and after \"6C\", added \"6E\".\n\nVeto of severability clause unconstitutional.— The governor's veto of Laws 1981, ch. 39, § 129, the severability clause of the Liquor Control Act, was unconstitutional under N.M. Const., art. IV, § 22, because that act does not appropriate money and the governor's power of partial veto is limited to bills appropriating money.Chronis v. State ex rel. Rodriguez, 1983-NMSC-081, 100 N.M. 342, 670 P.2d 953.\n\nTransfer of license despite municipal disapproval.— Under the Liquor Control Act, the director of the alcohol and gaming division of the New Mexico regulation and licensing department may approve a transfer of a license despite municipal disapproval. The director must so act if the governing body fails to submit evidence supporting its decision or if, on its face, the governing body's decision is not based on evidence pertaining to the specific prospective transferee or location.Southland Corp. v. Manzagol, 1994-NMSC-099, 118 N.M. 423, 882 P.2d 14.\n\nThe host of a private event where liquor is served is not required to obtain a license from the alcohol and gaming division.— The Liquor Control Act, 60-3A-1 to 60-7B-13 NMSA 1978, regulates the manufacture, wholesale distribution, and retail sales of alcoholic beverages in the state through a comprehensive licensing scheme of businesses, premises and individuals authorized to sell or serve alcohol to the public, but there is no provision in the Liquor Control Act pertaining to private parties, which are defined by regulation as an event open only to invited guests and not open or advertised to the general public and does not include alcohol industry promotional events or other events with a commercial purpose, and therefore, a chamber of commerce and its guests would not be in violation of the Liquor Control Act if the event is held in accordance with the definition of a private party by maintaining a list of invited guests, and denying entry to those not on the list, not advertising the event to the general public, and avoiding activities that would indicate the event is being held for a commercial purpose.Application of the New Mexico Liquor Control Act to a Private Function where Liquor is Served(12/4/20), Att'y Gen.

      "text": "A. It is the policy of the Liquor Control Act that the sale, service and public consumption of alcoholic beverages in the state shall be licensed, regulated and controlled so as to protect the public health, safety and morals of every community in the state; and it is the responsibility of the director to investigate the qualifications of all applicants for licenses under that act, to investigate the conditions existing in the community in which the premises for which any license is sought are located before the license is issued, to the end that licenses shall not be issued to persons or for locations when the issuance is prohibited by law or contrary to the public health, safety or morals.\n\nB. It is the intent of the Liquor Control Act that each person to whom a license is issued shall be fully liable and accountable for the use of the license, including but not limited to liability for all violations of the Liquor Control Act and for all taxes charged against the license.\n\nHistory:Laws 1981, ch. 39, § 2.\n\nFederal preemption.— New Mexico's regulatory scheme of airlines' alcoholic beverage services provided to passengers is impliedly preempted as it falls within the field of aviation safety that Congress intended federal law to occupy exclusively. However, the Twenty-first Amendment of the United States Constitution requires a balancing of New Mexico's core powers and the federal interests underlying the FAA.US Airways, Inc. v. O'Donnell, 627 F.3d 1318 (10th Cir. 2010).\n\nNew Mexico Liquor Control Act is exercise of police powerof the state, for the welfare, health, peace, temperance and safety of its people.Baca v. Grisolano, 1953-NMSC-028, 57 N.M. 176, 256 P.2d 792.\n\nLicense not property right, but privilege in constitutional sense.— A liquor license is a privilege and not property within the meaning of the due process and contract clauses of the constitutions of this state and the nation, and in them licensees have no vested property rights.Baca v. Grisolano, 1953-NMSC-028, 57 N.M. 176, 256 P.2d 792.\n\nThe licensee has no vested property right in a liquor license as it is a privilege and not property.Yarbrough v. Montoya, 1950-NMSC-006, 54 N.M. 91, 214 P.2d 769.\n\nSale of liquor not inherent privilege of United States or state citizenship.— Retail sale of intoxicating liquor is not reckoned among the inherent privileges of a citizen of the United States or the state, but is a business which is attended with dangers to the community so that it may be entirely prohibited or authorized under such conditions as will limit its evil propensities to the utmost degree.Yarbrough v. Montoya, 1950-NMSC-006, 54 N.M. 91, 214 P.2d 769.\n\nAs between state and licensee, liquor license is mere revocable privilegevesting no property rights in the licensee.Nelson v. Naranjo, 1964-NMSC-209, 74 N.M. 502, 395 P.2d 228.\n\nLiability of lessors.— Lessors of a liquor license are fully liable and accountable for debts incurred by the lessee in the course of his use of the license.Gavin Maloof & Co. v. Sw. Distrib. Co., 1987-NMSC-103, 106 N.M. 413, 744 P.2d 541.\n\nIn a case against an absent owner-lessor of a liquor license, arising out of the lessee's service of alcohol to an intoxicated patron who injured third parties (the plaintiffs), Section 41-11-1A NMSA 1978, enacted in 1983, under which the absent owner-lessor is liable for the acts of a lessee not in the employ of the licensee, was not applicable. At the time of the injury in 1982 the cause of action created by Subsection B of this section inured to the plaintiffs as a vested right, and the court could not apply Section 41-11-1A NMSA 1978 retroactively against the plaintiffs and divest them of that right.Ashbaugh v. Williams, 1987-NMSC-120, 106 N.M. 598, 747 P.2d 244.\n\nThe lessor of a liquor license can be held liable under the terms of Section 60-7A-16 NMSA 1978 (sales to intoxicated persons) if a violation is proved.Williams v. Ashbaugh, 1986-NMCA-073, 120 N.M. 731, 906 P.2d 263,aff'd, 1987-NMSC-120, 106 N.M. 598, 747 P.2d 244.\n\nPurpose of liquor control legislation is to regulate and restrainand not to promote, and any loosening of that policy is the business of the legislature, not of the courts.State ex rel. Maloney v. Sierra, 1970-NMSC-144, 82 N.M. 125, 477 P.2d 301; 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-03.\n\nPurpose of liquor control legislation.— The Liquor Control Act is a police regulation and its purpose is, as stated therein, to protect the public health, safety and morals of every community in the state. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-68.\n\nPower to control distribution, sale and consumption of alcoholic liquors is vested in legislature.In exercising its power, the New Mexico legislature has enacted laws providing a uniform, comprehensive regulatory scheme governing those areas where the state's interest is preeminent. 1980 Op.

Baize, 1958-NMSC-064, 64 N.M. 168, 326 P.2d 367.\n\nNor instruction to find beyond reasonable doubt required.— The refusal of the court to instruct the jury they must find beyond a reasonable doubt that beer alleged to have been sold contained more than one-half of one percent alcohol was not error.State v. Spahr, 1958-NMSC-103, 64 N.M. 395, 328 P.2d 1093.\n\nMeaning of \"dispenser\".— Dispenser is any person \"selling, offering for sale or having in his possession with intent to sell, alcoholic liquors by the drink or in packages\" and a dispenser \"sells\" by the drink, not just \"serves,\" and the word \"sell\" is not limited to liquor in packages.State ex rel. Maloney v. Sierra, 1970-NMSC-144, 82 N.M. 125, 477 P.2d 301.\n\n\"Licensed premises\".— Since this section limits the use of the license only to the \"licensed premises,\" this section will not permit the licensing of two or more totally independent structures under a single liquor license where one of the structures is already licensed as a full service lounge and the licensee proposes to operate a restaurant which would provide full service liquor sales in another structure located several hundred yards away from the lounge. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-10.\n\nElectoral history determines whether city and county separate \"local option districts\".— In order for a city to constitute a separate local option district, it is essential that the city have a population in excess of five thousand residents and that the city have voted in favor of the sale of alcoholic liquors within its distinct limits, and will depend on the electoral history of the governmental subdivisions with respect to the approval of the sale of alcoholic liquors within their respective geographical limits. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-116,overruled by1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-15.\n\nVeterans' clubs qualify for \"club\" license.— Legally constituted chapters of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars do qualify for the issuance of a \"club\" license under this section. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-118.\n\nMeaning of \"beverage\".— Fitness for beverage purposes is an essential attribute of intoxicating liquor, and, notwithstanding a liquor contains the requisite amount of alcohol, it is not an intoxicating liquor if it is unfit for beverage purposes. The word \"beverage,\" as used in the statutes relating to intoxicating liquors, means a liquor that is capable of being drunk, and, in determining whether a liquor is capable of being used as a beverage, the test applied is not limited to the case of an average individual with average tastes. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-190.\n\nAlcoholic concoction within scope of liquor laws if \"beverage\".— In order to permit salted (cooking) wines to be sold in food store outlets without the payment of excise tax, the question must first be, either judicially or administratively, determined: \"is the concoction in question capable of being used as a beverage?\" If the answer is in the affirmative, then because of its alcoholic content, it would definitely be within the scope of the law pertaining to the sale of alcoholic liquors. If the question is answered in the negative, then no liquor tax would have to be paid on it and the product could be marketed in food stores without a license. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-190.\n\nMeaning of \"package\".— In keeping with the usages expressed by and implied from the term \"package,\" such refers to the individual bottles, cans or crocks, as the case may be. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-243.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —45 Am.
