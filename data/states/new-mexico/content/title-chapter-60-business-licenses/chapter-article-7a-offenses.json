A violation of this section does not bar recovery by the wholesaler for the total indebtedness of the retailer, dispenser, canopy licensee, restaurant licensee, club licensee or governmental licensee or its lessee.\n\nHistory:Laws 1981, ch. 39, § 71; 1985, ch. 39, § 1.\n\nFailure to collect invoices.— Where the liquor wholesaler did not promptly bring an action to recover the amount due on invoices that had remained unpaid for more than thirty days, but continued to deliver more liquor to the retailer without receiving immediate payment, the wholesaler extended credit to the retailer in violation of this section.N.M. Beverage Co. v. Blything, 1985-NMSC-039, 102 N.M. 533, 697 P.2d 952.\n\nCredit extended during initial 30 days.— Credit sales made within the initial 30-day period before the retailer falls behind in payments on his account are not declared violations of this section, and 60-8A-5 NMSA 1978 does not bar a wholesaler from bringing an action to collect debts arising from such credit sales.Pucci Distrib. Co. v. Stephens, 1987-NMSC-075, 106 N.M. 228, 741 P.2d 831.\n\nTime period for credit sales.— Since 15 days is a reasonable amount of time for a wholesale liquor distributor to determine what bills are past due from purchasers, any credit sales of liquor made to debtor by the wholesale liquor distributors within the first 45 days from the date of the first unpaid invoice are in conformance with the requirements of this section and are collectable, while any credit sales made after this forty-five day period demonstrate an implicit agreement to extend credit and, thus, are in violation of this section and uncollectable.Sholer v. Bank of Albuquerque (In re Gallegos), 68 B.R. 584 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1986) (decided under former Section 60-10-8 NMSA 1978).\n\nConduct violative of section.— Where, from a review of the invoices submitted, it is obvious that wholesale liquor distributors were extending credit long after the debtor had been in arrears in excess of 30 days, such implied agreement to extend credit is conduct prohibited by this section.Sholer v. Bank of Albuquerque (In re Gallegos), 68 B.R. 584 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1986) (decided under former Section 60-10-8 NMSA 1978).\n\nTo violate this section, a liquor wholesaler must continue to make credit sales to a liquor retailer knowing at the time that the retailer is more than 30 calendar days behind in its credit payments to the wholesaler.Gavin Maloof & Co. v. Sw. Distrib. Co., 1987-NMSC-103, 106 N.M. 413, 744 P.2d 541.\n\nWholesaler may collect despite violation.— The purpose of the 1985 amendment was to eliminate the forfeiture and allow the wholesaler to collect its debt even though there may be a violation of this section.D & M, Inc. v. United N.M. Bank, 114 B.R. 274 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1990).\n\nLiquor wholesalers' superpriority liens created by former Section 60-6B-3E NMSA 1978 were prior to a bank's perfected security interest even if there was a violation of this section.D & M, Inc. v.
