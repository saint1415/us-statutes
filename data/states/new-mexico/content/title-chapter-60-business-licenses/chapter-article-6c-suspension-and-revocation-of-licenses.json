      "text": "A. The director may suspend or revoke the license or permit or fine the licensee in an amount not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or both, when the director finds that a licensee has:\n\n(1) violated any provision of the Liquor Control Act [60-3A-1 NMSA 1978] or any rule or order promulgated pursuant to that act;\n\n(2) been convicted of a felony pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Code [30-1-1 NMSA 1978], the Liquor Control Act or federal law; or\n\n(3) permitted the licensee's licensed premises to remain a public nuisance in the neighborhood where it is located after written notice from the director that investigation by the department has revealed that the establishment is a public nuisance in the neighborhood.\n\nB. The director shall suspend or revoke the license or permit and may fine the licensee in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or both, when the director finds that any licensee or:\n\n(1) the licensee's employee or agent knowingly has sold, served, delivered or given an alcoholic beverage to a minor in violation of Section 60-7B-1 NMSA 1978 or to an intoxicated person in violation of Section 60-7A-16 NMSA 1978, on two separate occasions within any twelve-month period; or\n\n(2) the licensee's agent has made any material false statement or concealed any material facts in the licensee's application for the license or permit granted the licensee pursuant to the provisions of the Liquor Control Act.\n\nC. A licensee aggrieved by a revocation, suspension or fine proposed to be imposed by the director pursuant to this section shall be entitled to the hearing procedures set forth in Chapter 60, Article 6C NMSA 1978 before the revocation, suspension or fine shall be effective.\n\nD. A charge filed against a licensee by the department and the resulting disposition of the charge shall be reported to the department of public safety.\n\nE. For purposes of this section, \"licensee\" includes any person issued an alcoholic beverage delivery permit.\n\nHistory:Laws 1981, ch. 39, § 97; 1993, ch. 68, § 11; 1998 (1st S.S.), ch. 16, § 1; 2021, ch. 7, § 17.\n\nCross references.— For cancellation of license for nonuse, failure to engage in business,see60-6B-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective July 1, 2021, defined \"licensee\" for purposes of this section, eliminated a requirement to report a charge against a licensee to local law enforcement, and made technical amendments; in Paragraph B(1), after \"served\", added \"delivered\"; in Subsection D, after \"department of public safety\", deleted \"and local law enforcement agencies whose jurisdictions include the licensed establishment\"; and added Subsection E.\n\nThe 1998 (1st S.S.) amendment,effective August 2, 1998, deleted former Subsection C, relating to penalties for selling, serving or delivering alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person or a minor through a drive-up window, redesignated the subsequent subsections accordingly, and made a minor stylistic change in present Subsection C.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, inserted \"or administrative fine\" in the catchline; rewrote the introductory paragraph of Subsection A which read \"A liquor control hearing officer may suspend or revoke the license or fine the licensee, or both when he finds that any licensee has\"; rewrote Paragraph (2) of Subsection A which read \"made any material false statement in his application for the license granted him under the provisions of the Liquor Control Act\"; deleted \"suffered or\" at the beginning of Paragraph (3) of Subsection A; added current Subsections B to D; redesignated former Subsection B as Subsection E; substituted \"department of public safety\" for \"state police\" and \"jurisdictions\" for \"jurisdiction\" in Subsection E; and made a minor stylistic change.\n\nCriminal conviction is not a condition precedent to the imposition of a fine.— The criminal conviction of a server under Section 60-7B-1 NMSA 1978 is not a condition precedent to the imposition of a civil fine on the licensee pursuant to Subsection A of Section 60-6C-1 NMSA 1978.Town & Country Food Stores, Inc. v. N. M. Regulation & Licensing Dep't, 2012-NMCA-046, 277 P.3d 490.\n\nWhere, in a sting operation, the licensee's employee sold beer to a minor; a hearing officer found that the licensee violated Section 60-7B-1 NMSA 1978 and imposed a fine on the licensee; and the district attorney dismissed charges filed against the employee after the employee completed a pre-prosecution program, the criminal conviction of the employee was not a condition precedent to the imposition of the fine under Subsection A of Section 60-6C-1 NMSA 1978.Town & Country Food Stores, Inc. v. N. M. Regulation & Licensing Dep't, 2012-NMCA-046, 277 P.3d 490.\n\nSuperintendent has inherent power to cancel and revoke licenses.— The chief of the division (now director of alcohol and gaming division), having power to grant liquor licenses under the provisions of the Liquor Control Act has likewise inherent power to cancel and revoke any license which he finds has been, for any reason, issued without authority or issued in conflict with the statutes governing and limiting the issuance thereof.Baca v. Grisolano, 1953-NMSC-028, 57 N.M. 176, 256 P.2d 792.\n\nPresumption that valid license originally issued.— This section, in setting up grounds for revocation of a license, obviously implies that a prior valid license had been issued and the grounds of revocation enumerated in the statute relate to misconduct of one kind or another on the part of the licensee.Baca v. Grisolano, 1953-NMSC-028, 57 N.M. 176, 256 P.2d 792.\n\nMistake of facts in issuing license ground for revocation.— A license issued under a mistake of facts necessary to authorize its issuance may be revoked; and the officer issuing it is not estopped by his conduct in issuing it to revoke or cancel it. Such a proceeding does not come under the statute authorizing a revocation of a license because of misconduct of the holder.Baca v. Grisolano, 1953-NMSC-028, 57 N.M. 176, 256 P.2d 792.\n\nSale of liquor on Sunday.— Making a sale of intoxicating liquor on Sunday was grounds for revocation of dispenser's license.Kearns v. Aragon, 1959-NMSC-102, 65 N.M. 119, 333 P.2d 607.\n\nRevocation needs evidential support.— Action of chief of division (now director of alcohol and gaming division) in revoking a license on the ground that it was issued illegally must be supported by some evidence of probative value, or else the decision of the liquor authority must be set aside.Baca v. Chaffin, 1953-NMSC-006, 57 N.M. 17, 253 P.2d 309.\n\nAs sale of liquor during prohibited hours.— Where proprietor permits his employees to sell liquor during prohibited hours, he would be liable under the statute for the violation and his license would be subject to revocation. 1945 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 45-4680.\n\nFailure to pay wholesaler not grounds for revocation.— No retailer, dispenser or club licensee subjects himself to a suspension or revocation of his license by failing to pay his bills to a licensed wholesaler within 30 days from the date of delivery. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-153.\n\nPremises remaining public nuisance.— A hearing officer may revoke a liquor license after hearing where the licensee permits his premises to remain a public nuisance after written notice from the director. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-15.\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico law relating to administrative law, see 12 N.M.L. Rev. 1 (1982).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —45 Am.

      "text": "A. Whenever a person lodges a signed, written complaint with the department alleging that a licensee has violated any of the provisions of the Liquor Control Act [60-3A-1 NMSA 1978], unless the complaint is deficient on its face, the director shall request that the department of public safety investigate the complaint.\n\nB. The department of public safety shall investigate the complaint and make a written report to the director.\n\nC. If the director believes from the report that probable cause exists for filing charges against the licensee for the revocation or suspension of the licensee's license or permit or for fining the licensee, or for both, the director or the director's designee shall file in the department a charge against the licensee in the name of the state, stating the nature of the grounds relied upon for the filing, the approximate date of the alleged violation and the names and addresses of the witnesses who are expected to give testimony or evidence against the licensee.\n\nD. After charges have been filed, the director shall issue a signed order for the licensee to appear at a hearing to explain, on the basis of any ground set out in the charge, why the license or permit should not be revoked or suspended or why the licensee should not be fined, or both.\n\nE. The director shall keep the original of the charge and the order to show cause on file in the director's office.\n\nF. The director shall appoint a hearing officer no later than ten days prior to the date set for the hearing at which the licensee shall appear to explain why the licensee's license or permit should not be revoked or suspended or why the licensee should not be fined, or both.\n\nG. The director shall have a copy of the charge and a copy of the order to show cause sent to the licensee or the licensee's resident agent at the agent's last known address by certified mail at least fourteen days before the date set for the hearing on the order to show cause.\n\nH. At a hearing on an order to show cause, the director shall cause a record of hearing to be made, which shall record:\n\n(1) the style of the proceedings;\n\n(2) the nature of the proceedings, including a copy of the charge and a copy of the order to show cause;\n\n(3) the place, date and time of the hearing and all continuances or recesses of the hearing;\n\n(4) the appearance or nonappearance of the licensee;\n\n(5) if the licensee appears with an attorney, the name and address of the attorney;\n\n(6) a record of all evidence and testimony and a copy or record of all exhibits introduced in evidence;\n\n(7) the findings of fact and law as to whether the licensee has violated the Liquor Control Act as set out in the charge; and\n\n(8) the decision of the director.\n\nI. If the licensee fails to appear without good cause at the time and place designated in the order to show cause for the hearing, the director shall order the nonappearance of the licensee to be entered in the record of hearing and shall order the license or permit revoked or suspended or the licensee fined, or both, on all the grounds alleged in the charge and shall cause the record of hearing to show the particulars in detail. In such a case, there shall be no reopening, appeal or review of the proceedings unless pursued by a co-owner of a license who did not receive notice of the hearing.\n\nJ. If the licensee admits guilt on all grounds set out in the charge, the director shall order the revocation or suspension of the license or permit or the licensee fined, or both, and cause a record of hearing to be made showing the facts and particulars of the director's order of revocation or suspension of the license or permit or fine of the licensee, or both. In such a case, there shall be no review or appeal of the proceedings.\n\nK. If the licensee appears at the hearing and does not testify or denies guilt of any of the grounds set out in the charge, the hearing shall proceed as follows:\n\n(1) the director or the hearing officer shall administer oaths to all witnesses, the department shall cause all testimony and evidence in support of the grounds alleged in the charge to be presented in the presence of the licensee and the director shall allow the licensee or the licensee's attorney to cross-examine all witnesses;\n\n(2) the licensee shall be allowed to present testimony and evidence the licensee may have in denial or in mitigation of the grounds set out in the charge;\n\n(3) the department shall have the right to cross-examine the licensee or any witness testifying in the licensee's favor;\n\n(4) the department shall present any evidence or testimony in rebuttal of that produced by the licensee;\n\n(5) the director or the hearing officer shall make a finding on each ground alleged and a finding of the guilt or innocence of the licensee on each ground;\n\n(6) if the licensee is found guilty on any ground alleged and proved, the director shall make an order of revocation or suspension of the license or permit or fine of the licensee, or both; and\n\n(7) the rules of evidence shall not be required to be observed, but the order of suspension or revocation or fine, or both, shall be based upon substantial, competent and relevant evidence and testimony appearing in the record of hearing.\n\nL. No admission of guilt, admission against interest or transcript of testimony made or given in a hearing pursuant to this section shall be received or used in criminal proceedings wherein the licensee is a defendant; provided, however, if the licensee commits perjury in a hearing, the evidence shall be admissible in a perjury trial if otherwise competent and relevant.\n\nM. The director shall adopt reasonable rules setting forth uniform standards of penalties concerning fines and suspensions imposed by the director.\n\nN. For purposes of this section, \"licensee\" includes a person issued an alcoholic beverage delivery permit.\n\nHistory:Laws 1981, ch. 39, § 100; 1993, ch. 68, § 13; 2021, ch. 7, § 19.\n\nCross references.— For service of process,seeRule 1-004 NMRA.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective July 1, 2021, included \"permits\" within the provisions of the section, allowed license co-owners, who did not receive notice of a hearing, to appeal or reopen proceedings in cases where the licensee failed to appear at a hearing, defined \"licensee\" for purposes of this section, and made technical amendments; after \"license\", added \"or permit\" throughout; in Subsection I, after \"review of the proceedings\", added \"unless pursued by a co-owner of a license who did not receive notice of the hearing\"; and added Subsection N.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, rewrote this section to the extent that a detailed comparison is impracticable.\n\nOffer of proof.— In administrative proceedings, where a party's proffered evidence is denied on the ground of relevance, the party has a right to make an offer of proof to show on appeal what the content of the evidence was as well as testimony in regard to the evidence that would bear on relevance.ERICA, Inc. v. N.M. Regulation & Licensing Dep't, 2008-NMCA-065, 144 N.M. 132, 184 P.3d 444.\n\nPurpose of proceeding.— The object of an administrative proceeding to revoke a liquor license is not intended as a punishment of the licensee. The purpose is to ensure so far as possible the decent and orderly conduct of a business affecting the public health, morals, safety and welfare.Kearns v. Aragon, 1959-NMSC-102, 65 N.M. 119, 333 P.2d 607.\n\nProceeding in nature of civil action.— A proceeding before the chief of division of liquor control (now director of alcohol and gaming division) to revoke a liquor license is not a criminal proceeding; rather it is an administrative proceeding in the nature of a civil action.Kearns v. Aragon, 1959-NMSC-102, 65 N.M. 119, 333 P.2d 607;Lake v. Garcia, 1978-NMSC-035, 91 N.M. 608, 577 P.2d 1254.\n\nSection requires the director to sign order to show cause issued to licensee.Absent the director's signature, the process is void. Any order issued pursuant to defective process is null and void for lack of jurisdiction.Lasley v. Baca, 1981-NMSC-041, 95 N.M. 791, 626 P.2d 1288.\n\nRevocation proceedings are not governed by rules of criminal prosecutions.In such proceedings the offense need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt.Kearns v. Aragon, 1959-NMSC-102, 65 N.M. 119, 333 P.2d 607.\n\nCertain constitutional defenses not available.— The constitutional defenses of unreasonable search and seizure and self-incrimination are not available in revocation proceedings.Kearns v. Aragon, 1959-NMSC-102, 65 N.M. 119, 333 P.2d 607.\n\nTestimony of entrapped witnesses competent.— In proceedings before the chief of division of liquor control (now director of alcohol and gaming division), even assuming that the action of the state police officers constituted entrapment, this fact alone does not render witnesses' testimony unsubstantial, incompetent, irrelevant or incredible. The mere circumstance, standing alone, that the state's witnesses were engaged in a species of entrapment does not render their testimony unworthy of belief.Kearns v. Aragon, 1959-NMSC-102, 65 N.M. 119, 333 P.2d 607.\n\nLicense cannot be cancelled by operation of lawas to do so would relieve the chief of division (now director of alcohol and gaming division) of his duties to make a determination of facts authorizing the cancellation and to effect the cancellation pursuant thereto.Crowe v. State ex rel. McCulloch, 1971-NMSC-017, 82 N.M. 296, 480 P.2d 691.\n\nDetermination of facts required prior to cancellation.— Before cancelling a license pursuant to this duty, the chief of division (now director of alcohol and gaming division) must, of necessity, determine the facts which would authorize the cancellation.Crowe v. State ex rel. McCulloch, 1971-NMSC-017, 82 N.M. 296, 480 P.2d 691.\n\nWhen order suspending license fatally defective.— Order suspending liquor license was fatally defective in that the record did not contain a copy of the charge and a copy of the order to show cause, as required by this section.Jumbo, Inc. v. State ex rel. Branch, 1970-NMSC-025, 81 N.M. 223, 465 P.2d 280.\n\nLiquor control hearing officer presides only at hearings that result from formal chargeslooking toward suspension or revocation of an existing license.
