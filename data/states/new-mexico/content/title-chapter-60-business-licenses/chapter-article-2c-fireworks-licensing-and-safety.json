To the extent that municipalities have regulatory authority over specified devices, those devices are subject to double regulation as long as municipal regulations do not conflict with the requirements of this article. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-11.\n\nThis article denies all municipalities, including those with home rule charters, from regulating fireworks other than as provided by the statute. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen.
