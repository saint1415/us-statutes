The legislature not only provided for the selection of persons eminent in their field and gave them authority to grant and/or refuse and revoke licenses, but further provided in Section 60-1-9 NMSA 1978 (now Section 60-1A-11 NMSA 1978) that the commission's determinations should be final and conclusive and not subject to any appeal.Ross v.

The petitioners should have been afforded the opportunity to submit financial or other necessary information so that the commission could properly exercise its discretion in granting or refusing a license.Ross v. State Racing Comm'n, 1958-NMSC-117, 64 N.M. 478, 330 P.2d 701 (decided under former law).\n\nStrict liability may be imposedby the state as a right to participate in horse races or to hold a license to do so.Sanderson v.

A license is a privilege and not a right within the meaning of the due process clause of the state and federal constitutions and in it licensees have no vested property rights.Sanderson v. N.M. State Racing Comm'n, 1969-NMSC-031, 80 N.M. 200, 453 P.2d 370 (decided under former law).\n\nState racing commission has no common-law or inherent powersand can act only as to those matters which are within the scope of its delegated authority. 1979 Op.

Att'y Gen. No. 79-15 (rendered under former law).\n\nCommission may allow race meet to occur at two different locations.— The commission is not prohibited from allowing a race meet to occur at two different locations, and may approve a licensee's application for a race meet that begins at one of the licensee's facilities and concludes at another of the licensee's facilities. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen.

An application for a racetrack license shall be submitted in writing on forms designated by the commission. An applicant shall affirm that information contained in the application is true and accurate. The application shall be signed by the applicant or the applicant's agent, and the signature shall be notarized.\n\nC. A racetrack license shall be valid for a period not to exceed one year.

The commission may schedule a date for a hearing on the application for a new racetrack license to determine the eligibility of the applicant pursuant to the Horse Racing Act or as needed for determining the eligibility for the renewal of a racetrack license. The applicant shall be notified of the hearing at least five days prior to the date of the hearing. The applicant has the right to present testimony in support of the application. Notice shall be mailed to the address of the applicant appearing upon the application for the racetrack license. Notice of the hearing date, time and location shall be postmarked by United States mail five days prior to the date of the hearing. Deposit of the hearing notice in United States mail constitutes notice.\n\nI. If, after a hearing on the application, the commission finds the applicant ineligible pursuant to the provisions of the Horse Racing Act or rules adopted by the board, the racetrack license shall be denied.\n\nJ.

Upon renewal, the commission shall determine the racing days that will be allotted to each applicant upon terms and conditions established by the commission.\n\nK. A person shall not have a direct, indirect or beneficial interest of any nature, whether or not financial, administrative, policymaking or supervisory, in more than two horse racetracks in New Mexico. For purposes of this subsection, a person shall not be considered to have a direct, indirect or beneficial interest in a horse racetrack if the person owns or holds less than ten percent of the total authorized, issued and outstanding shares of a corporation that is licensed to conduct a race meet in New Mexico, unless the person has some other direct, indirect or beneficial interest of any nature, whether or not financial, administrative, policymaking or supervisory, in more than two licensed horse racetracks.\n\nL. To determine interest held in a racetrack, to the extent that the interest is based on stock ownership:\n\n(1) stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a corporation, partnership, estate or trust shall be considered as being owned proportionately by its shareholders, partners or beneficiaries;\n\n(2) an individual shall be considered as owning the stock, directly or indirectly, if it is held by an immediate family member. For purposes of this paragraph, an \"immediate family member\" includes only the individual's siblings, spouse or children; and\n\n(3) stock constructively owned by a person by reason of the application of Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be considered to be actually owned by the person; and stock shall be constructively owned by an individual by reason of the application of Paragraph (2) of this subsection if the purpose of the constructive ownership is to make a person other than the individual applicant appear as the owner of the stock.\n\nM. A corporation holding a racetrack license shall not issue to a person shares of its stock amounting to ten percent or more of the total authorized, issued and outstanding shares, and a corporation holding a racetrack license shall not issue shares of its stock that would, when combined with that stock transferee's existing shares owned, total more than ten percent of the total authorized, issued and outstanding shares of the corporation, unless:\n\n(1) the corporation gives written notice to the commission at least sixty days before the contemplated stock transfer that the person to whom the stock is being transferred will become an owner of ten percent or more of the total authorized, issued and outstanding shares of the corporation; and\n\n(2) the corporation receives written approval from the commission of the proposed transfer.\n\nN.

The statutory language refers to approval of contracts and thus presupposes an existing contract. Once the contract is entered, submission of the contract to the state racing commission for its approval is to be required, and if there is no submission for approval, the possible penalty is cancellation or revocation of the racing license.Sierra Blanca Sales Co. v.
