      "text": "A. Before a new license authorized by the Liquor Control Act [60-3A-1 NMSA 1978] may be issued by the director, the applicant for the license shall:\n\n(1) submit to the director a written application for the license under oath, in the form prescribed by and stating the information required by the director, together with a nonrefundable application fee of two hundred dollars ($200);\n\n(2) submit to the director for approval a description, including floor plans, in a form prescribed by the director, that shows the proposed licensed premises for which the license application is submitted. The area represented by the approved description shall become the licensed premises;\n\n(3) submit the name and street address of a New Mexico resident who is not a felon, who has power of attorney and authority to bind the applicant to matters related to liquor sales and operations and upon whom the director may serve any notice related to ownership or operation of the license, including any notice of charge pursuant to Chapter 60, Article 6C NMSA 1978;\n\n(4) if the applicant is a corporation, be required to submit as part of its application the following:\n\n(a) a certified copy of its articles of incorporation or, if a foreign corporation, a certified copy of its certificate of authority;\n\n(b) the names and addresses of all officers and directors and those stockholders owning ten percent or more of the voting stock of the corporation and the amounts of stock held by each stockholder; provided, however, a corporation may not be licensed if an officer, manager, director or holder of more than a ten percent interest in the applicant entity would not be eligible to hold a license pursuant to the Liquor Control Act; and\n\n(c) such additional information regarding the corporation as the director may require to assure full disclosure of the corporation's structure and financial responsibility;\n\n(5) if the applicant is a limited partnership, submit as part of its application the following:\n\n(a) a certified copy of its certificate of limited partnership;\n\n(b) the names and addresses of all general partners and of all limited partners contributing ten percent or more of the total value of contributions made to the limited partnership or entitled to ten percent or more of the profits earned or other income paid by the limited partnership. A limited partnership shall not receive a license if a partner or holder of a ten percent or greater interest in the applicant entity designated in this subsection would not be eligible to hold a license issued pursuant to the Liquor Control Act; and\n\n(c) such additional information regarding the limited partnership as the director may require to assure full disclosure of the limited partnership's structure and financial responsibility;\n\n(6) if the applicant is a limited liability company, submit as part of its application the following:\n\n(a) a copy of the articles of organization, with a copy of the certificate of filing with the public regulation commission;\n\n(b) the name and addresses of all the managing members and all of the nonmanaging members that own a greater than ten percent interest in the limited liability company. Any direct or indirect parent entity of the limited liability company with an interest of ten percent or more in the applicant entity shall submit application forms and qualify to hold a license; and\n\n(c) such additional information regarding the limited liability company as the director may require to assure full disclosure of the limited liability company's structure and financial responsibility;\n\n(7) if the applicant is a trust, submit as part of its application:\n\n(a) the names and addresses of the trustees;\n\n(b) the names and addresses of any beneficiaries having control over the property of the trust or receiving regular and substantial distributions of principal and income from the trust. Any beneficiary receiving regular and substantial distributions from the trust shall qualify to hold a license. The director may request a copy of the trust agreement for review, which trust agreement need not become part of the application. Affidavits as to the operation and distribution of the principal and income may be requested in lieu of, or in addition to, the copy of the trust agreement that is supplied for review by the department; and\n\n(c) such additional information regarding the trust as the director may require to assure full disclosure of the trust's structure and financial responsibility; and\n\n(8) obtain approval for the issuance from the governing body of the local option district in which the proposed licensed premises are to be located in accordance with the provisions of the Liquor Control Act.\n\nB. Except for individual officers, directors, shareholders, members or partners of entities that are publicly traded on a national stock exchange and for individuals who have been fingerprinted for another New Mexico license and had no prior criminal or arrest record, every applicant for a new license or for a transfer of ownership of a license shall file with the application two complete sets of fingerprints taken under the supervision of and certified to by an officer of the New Mexico state police, a county sheriff, a municipal chief of police, a police officer in a foreign country or an individual qualified to take fingerprints by virtue of training or experience, for each of the following individuals:\n\n(1) if the applicant is a person, for the applicant;\n\n(2) if the applicant or the holder of a ten percent or greater interest in the applicant entity is a corporation, for each principal officer, for each member of the board of directors and for each stockholder with a ten percent or greater interest in the applicant entity;\n\n(3) if the applicant or the holder of a ten percent or greater interest in the applicant entity is a general partnership, for each partner;\n\n(4) if the applicant or the holder of a ten percent or greater interest in the applicant entity is a limited partnership, for each general partner, for each limited partner holding a ten percent or greater interest in the applicant entity and for any principal officers of the limited partnership;\n\n(5) if the applicant or the holder of a ten percent or greater interest in the applicant entity is a limited liability company, for each managing member, for each member who owns a ten percent or greater interest in the applicant entity and for any principal officer of the limited liability company; and\n\n(6) if the applicant is a trust, for each trustee and for each beneficiary who has control over trust property and income or who receives substantial and regular distributions from the trust.\n\nC. Upon submission of a sworn affidavit from each person who is required to file fingerprints stating that the person has not been convicted of a felony in any jurisdiction and pending the results of background investigations, a temporary license for ninety days may be issued. The temporary license may be extended by the director for an additional ninety days if the director determines there is not sufficient time to complete the background investigation or obtain reviews of fingerprints from appropriate agencies. A temporary license shall be surrendered immediately upon order of the director.\n\nD. An applicant who files a false affidavit shall be denied a license. When the director determines a false affidavit has been filed, the director shall refer the matter to the attorney general or district attorney for prosecution of perjury.\n\nE. If an applicant is not a resident of New Mexico, fingerprints may be taken under supervision and certification of comparable officers in the state of residence of the applicant.\n\nF. Before issuing a license, the department shall hold a public hearing within thirty days after receipt of the application pursuant to Subsection K of this section.\n\nG. An application for transfer of ownership shall be filed with the department no later than thirty days after the date a person acquired an ownership interest in a license. It shall contain the actual date of sale of the license and shall be accompanied by a sworn affidavit from the owner of record of the license agreeing to the sale of the license to the applicant as well as attesting to the accuracy of the information required by this section to be filed with the department. A license shall not be transferred unless it will be placed into operation in an actual location within one hundred twenty days of issuance of the license, unless for good cause shown the director grants an additional extension for a length of time determined by the director.\n\nH. Whenever it appears to the director that there will be more applications for new licenses than the available number of new licenses during any time period, a random selection method for the qualification, approval and issuance of new licenses shall be provided by the director. The random selection method shall allow each applicant an equal opportunity to obtain an available license, provided that all dispenser's and retailer's licenses issued in a calendar year shall be issued to residents of the state. For the purposes of random selection, the director shall also set a reasonable deadline by which applications for the available licenses shall be filed. A person shall not file more than one application for each available license and no more than three applications per calendar year.\n\nI. After the deadline set in accordance with Subsection H of this section, no more than ten applications per available license shall be selected at random for priority of qualification and approval. Within thirty days after the random selection for the ten priority positions for each license, a hearing pursuant to Subsection K of this section shall be held to determine the qualifications of the applicant having the highest priority for each available license. If necessary, such a hearing shall be held on each selected application by priority until a qualified applicant for each available license is approved. Further random selections for priority positions shall also be held pursuant to this section as necessary.\n\nJ. All applications submitted for a license shall expire upon the director's final approval of a qualified applicant for that available license.\n\nK. The director shall notify the applicant by certified mail of the date, time and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be held in Santa Fe. The director may designate a hearing officer to take evidence at the hearing. The director or the hearing officer shall have the power to administer oaths.\n\nL. In determining whether a license shall be issued, the director shall take into consideration all requirements of the Liquor Control Act. In the issuance of a license, the director shall specifically consider the nature and number of prior violations of the Liquor Control Act by the applicant or of any citations issued within the prior five years against a license held by the applicant or in which the applicant had an ownership interest required to be disclosed under the Liquor Control Act. The director shall disapprove the issuance or give preliminary approval of the issuance of the license based upon a review of all documentation submitted and any investigation deemed necessary by the director.\n\nM. Before a new license is issued for a location, the director shall cause a notice of the application for the license to be posted conspicuously, on a sign not smaller than thirty inches by forty inches, on the outside of the front wall or front entrance of the immediate premises for which the license is sought or, if no building or improvements exist on the premises, the notice shall be posted at the front entrance of the immediate premises for which the license is sought, on a billboard not smaller than five feet by five feet. The contents of the notice shall be in the form prescribed by the department, and such posting shall be over a continuous period of twenty days prior to preliminary approval of the license. The director shall prescribe the manner in which the posting may be accomplished by the licensee, the licensee's representative or the director's designee.\n\nN. A license shall not be issued until the posting requirements of Subsection M of this section have been met.\n\nO. All costs of publication and posting shall be paid by the applicant.\n\nP. It is unlawful for a person to remove or deface a notice posted in accordance with this section. A person convicted of a violation of this subsection shall be punished by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars ($300) or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one hundred twenty days or by both.\n\nQ. A person aggrieved by a decision made by the director as to the approval or disapproval of the issuance of a license may appeal to the district court pursuant to the provisions of Section 39-3-1.1 NMSA 1978. If the disapproval is based upon local option district disapproval pursuant to Subsection H of Section 60-6B-4 NMSA 1978, the local option district shall be a necessary party to an appeal. The decision of the director shall continue in force, pending a reversal or modification by the district court, unless otherwise ordered by the court.\n\nHistory:Laws 1981, ch. 39, § 38; 1983, ch. 6, § 1; 1989, ch. 118, § 1; 1993, ch. 329, § 4; 1998, ch. 55, § 1; 1998, ch. 93, § 1; 1999, ch. 265, § 74; 2003, ch. 246, § 2; 2007, ch. 220, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For definitions of \"department\" and \"director,\" see 60-3A-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the Parental Responsibility Act, see Chapter 40, Article 5A NMSA 1978.\n\nFor procedures governing administrative appeals to the district court, see Rule 1-074 NMRA.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, added Paragraph (3) of Subsection A; eliminated the exception that corporations whose stock is listed on a national securities exchange do not have to provide the names and addresses of officers and directors and stockholders; eliminated from Paragraph (3) of Subsection A the requirement that a corporation state the name of its resident agent and the requirement that a power of attorney authorize the resident agent to conduct the corporation's business in New Mexico; adds Paragraphs (6) and (7) of Subsection A; excepted certain persons from the requirement to submit fingerprints; and added Paragraphs (1) through (6) of Subsection B.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, substituted \"two hundred dollars ($200)\" for \"one hundred fifty dollars ($150)\" in Paragraph A(1).\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, in Subsection Q, substituted \"pursuant to the provisions of Section 39-3-1.1 NMSA 1978\" for \"pursuant to the provisions of Section 12-8A-1 NMSA 1978.\"\n\n1998 amendments.— Laws 1998, ch. 55, § 71, amending Subsection Q to provide for appeals pursuant to Section 12-8A-1 (compiled as Section 39-3-1.1 NMSA 1978), was approved March 9, 1998. However, Laws 1998, ch. 93, § 1, amending Subsection G by deleting \"documentation of the actual purchase price paid for the license\" following \"shall contain\" near the beginning of the second sentence and revising the last sentence to permit the director to grant extensions for a period of time determined by the director, was approved March 10, 1998. The section is set out as amended by Laws 1998, ch. 93, § 1. See 12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, substituted \"shall\" for \"must\" in Subparagraph (c) of Paragraph (3) of Subsection A; deleted the former last sentence of Subsection B, which read: \"Licenses may be issued by the department pending the results of any investigation based on the fingerprints submitted\"; added present Subsections C, D, and G, redesignating former Subsections C through M accordingly and making related reference changes in Subsections I and O; rewrote the last sentence of Subsection M; deleted \"retailer's or dispenser's\" before \"license\" and \"where alcoholic beverages are not then being sold\" after \"location\" near the beginning of Subsection N; deleted \"the hearing for the\" after \"prior to\" near the end of Subsection N; and added the present second sentence of Subsection R.\n\nSection applies to transfer of license.— Although this section and Section 60-6B-10 NMSA 1978 refer only to a license \"issued\", the sections apply equally to the transfer of a license; therefore, the decision by the director of the alcohol and gaming division of the department of regulation and licensing granting an application for transfer of a liquor license was reviewable by way of the statutory appeal provided in Subsection M (now Q) of this section.Regents of Univ. of N.M. v. Hughes, 1992-NMSC-049, 114 N.M. 304, 838 P.2d 458.\n\nPosting requirements must be satisfied before license issued.— This section clearly shows that there is no authority on the part of the chief of liquor control (now director of division of alcohol and gaming) to issue any license until the provisions in the statute with reference to posting are fulfilled.Baca v. Grisolano, 1953-NMSC-028, 57 N.M. 176, 256 P.2d 792.\n\nPosting conspicuous notice mandatory.— This section specifies how and where the notice of application shall be posted. It is precise and clear. This statute is mandatory.Baca v. Grisolano, 1953-NMSC-028, 57 N.M. 176, 256 P.2d 792.\n\n\"Conspicuous\" defined.— The word \"conspicuous\" means: \"Obvious to the eye or mind; plainly visible, manifest, attracting or tending to attract attention, as by reason of size, brilliance, contrast or station.\"Baca v. Grisolano, 1953-NMSC-028, 57 N.M. 176, 256 P.2d 792.\n\nMeaning of \"such posting\".— The language \"such posting\" in the last sentence of former Subsection C (now Subsection M) means that it must be conspicuous and it must be on the front entrance of the immediate premises.Baca v. Grisolano, 1953-NMSC-028, 57 N.M. 176, 256 P.2d 792.\n\nWhen notice not posted \"conspicuously\".— A notice was not posted conspicuously where it was posted back on unimproved property at a distance sufficient so that it could not be read by anyone at the edge of the highway and at the fence at the front of the premises but could be read only by those who took the trouble to climb over, or crawl through and go back to the post to read the notice thereon placed.Baca v. Grisolano, 1953-NMSC-028, 57 N.M. 176, 256 P.2d 792.\n\nPurpose of posting requirement.— The purpose behind the requirement that there be a posting of the liquor license application is to give notice to any interested person who may wish to protest it.Yarbrough v. Montoya, 1950-NMSC-006, 54 N.M. 91, 214 P.2d 769.\n\nProtests acceptable in either oral or written form.— As no provision is made for a hearing of the protest of individuals, it seems that this section concerning posting of notice contemplates protests may be in writing or oral.Baca v. Grisolano, 1953-NMSC-028, 57 N.M. 176, 256 P.2d 792;Yarbrough v. Montoya, 1950-NMSC-006, 54 N.M. 91, 214 P.2d 769.\n\nRight of appeal from director's decision limited.— Since a right of appeal exists only with reference to the issuance or refusal to issue of liquor licenses, and appeal does not lie from a decision of the chief of the division of liquor control (now director of alcohol and gaming division) denying application for the change of location in authorized use of the existing license.Taggader v. Montoya, 1949-NMSC-068, 54 N.M. 18, 212 P.2d 1049.\n\nGenerally, court cannot modify or overrule director's orders.— As long as the chief of the division of liquor control (now director of alcohol and gaming division) acts within the provisions of the law, courts cannot modify or overrule his administrative orders, or otherwise question the expediency or wisdom shown in issuing or revoking of liquor licenses.Yarbrough v. Montoya, 1950-NMSC-006, 54 N.M. 91, 214 P.2d 769.\n\nDistrict court cannot usurp administrative functions.— The district court does not have the administrative function of determining whether or not a liquor permit should be granted. The Liquor Control Act gives the court authority only to determine whether, upon the facts and law, the action of the official in cancelling the license was based upon an error of law or was unsupported by substantial evidence or clearly arbitrary or capricious; otherwise it would be a delegation of administrative authority to the district court in violation of the constitution.Floeck v. Bureau of Revenue, 1940-NMSC-014, 44 N.M. 194, 100 P.2d 225;Baca v. Grisolano, 1953-NMSC-028, 57 N.M. 176, 256 P.2d 792.\n\nDistrict court cannot pass upon legislative policy.— It is not for the courts to pass upon the wisdom of a legislative policy which removes from the municipality or county a segment of home rule which has long been associated with the liquor traffic.Sprunk v. Ward, 1947-NMSC-060, 51 N.M. 403, 186 P.2d 382.\n\nCourt's authority under section is limitedto determining whether under the facts and law, the action of the chief (now director of alcohol and gaming division) was based on error of law, was not supported by substantial evidence or was patently arbitrary or capricious.Yarbrough v. Montoya, 1950-NMSC-006, 54 N.M. 91, 214 P.2d 769.\n\nLicense renewal pending approval.— Where the liquor chief (now director of alcohol and gaming division) had suspended a liquor license, but the district court had set this order aside, the dealer was entitled to a renewal license subject to revocation or termination in case the district court's judgment should be reversed, on appeal.State v. Romero, 1944-NMSC-054, 49 N.M. 127, 158 P.2d 850.\n\nAggrieved person needs direct interest to obtain relief.— A person aggrieved must be a person having a direct interest, pecuniary or otherwise, one different from the public as a whole.Padilla v. Franklin, 1962-NMSC-083, 70 N.M. 243, 372 P.2d 820.\n\nAggrieved person must differ from interests of public.— Individual and institutional appellants who did not set forth nor show such a direct or pecuniary interest in the matter in controversy as to make them \"aggrieved persons\" were not entitled to relief under this section, since their interests in the public health, safety and morals of a community were no different than the interests of the public as a whole.Runyan v. Jaramillo, 1977-NMSC-061, 90 N.M. 629, 567 P.2d 478.\n\nJurisdiction of appeal from decision of district court.— The court of appeals had original appellate jurisdiction over an order of the division; however, for judicial economy and because the court of appeals requested direction as to the application of case law, the supreme court could decide the merits of the case.City of Santa Fe v. Woodard, 1996-NMSC-058, 122 N.M. 449, 926 P.2d 302.\n\nStanding necessary for appeal.— Present owner of a liquor license which he claimed was within the 10-mile limit which could prevent the issuance of a new license to opposing party, had a direct pecuniary interest as distinguished from the public as a whole, and was an aggrieved person who had standing to appeal the decision of the chief of division of liquor control (now director of alcohol and gaming division).Runyan v. Jaramillo, 1977-NMSC-061, 90 N.M. 629, 567 P.2d 478.\n\nOne appealing solely as remonstrant lacks standing.— One who appeals solely as a remonstrant challenging the jurisdiction of the chief of division (now director of alcohol and gaming division) in regard to the issuance of licenses to other applicants has no standing under this section.Padilla v. Franklin, 1962-NMSC-083, 70 N.M. 243, 372 P.2d 820.\n\nWrit of mandamus available as remedy when no right to appeal.— The fact that a city has no right to an appeal does not mean that it cannot bring an action for a writ of mandamus.City of Santa Rosa v. Jaramillo, 1973-NMSC-119, 85 N.M. 747, 517 P.2d 69.\n\nWhen issuance of writ of mandamus erroneous.— Where a letter from the division of liquor control (now director of alcohol and gaming division) clearly shows that the application had been considered and in fact that the application cannot be processed because the quota of one license to each 2000 people has been more than filled in Rio Arriba county, there can be no doubt this amounted to a final decision on the division's part to refuse the application. A decision is a determination arrived at after consideration, an opinion formed, or a course of action decided upon. The applicant's remedy upon being advised of the decision was by appeal to the district court of Santa Fe county as expressly provided by this section. It follows that the district court erred in entering its judgment ordering the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandamus.Armijo v. Armijo, 1967-NMSC-102, 77 N.M. 742, 427 P.2d 258.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment on Continental Oil Co. v. Oil Conservation Comm'n, 70 N.M. 310, 373 P.2d 809 (1962), see 3 Nat.

Such debts shall constitute a lien on the license, and the lien shall be deemed to have arisen on the date when the debt was originally incurred.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 60-6B-3, enacted by Laws 1991, ch. 257, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For definition of \"director,\" see 60-3A-3G NMSA 1978.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1991, ch. 257, § 2 repeals former 60-6B-3 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1984, ch. 58, § 2, relating to transfer of licenses, and enacts the above section, effective June 14, 1991.\n\nGeneral lien law not applicable.— General lien law does not apply to a claim made under this section.D & M, Inc. v. United N.M. Bank, 114 B.R. 274 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1990).\n\nNotice of lien.— This section does not require that notice of the lien be recorded to effectuate the liquor wholesaler's lien.In re What D'Ya Call It, Inc., 1986-NMSC-098, 105 N.M. 164, 730 P.2d 467.\n\nThis section does not require notice of the lien to be filed to perfect the liquor wholesaler's lien. Automatic perfection of the wholesaler's lien occurs on the date the debt is incurred. The statute allows a wholesale liquor distributor to forego the requirement of filing a financing statement each time a credit sale is made to a retail distributor.D & M, Inc. v. United N.M. Bank, 114 B.R. 274 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1990).\n\nPriority of lien.— A lien pursuant to this section has a superpriority status over other lienholders, including the tax lien in favor of the state, unless the latter liens were perfected under Section 7-1-38 NMSA 1978 or under applicable general law prior to the date the licensee incurred debts owed to wholesaler creditors.In re What D'Ya Call It, Inc., 1986-NMSC-098, 105 N.M. 164, 730 P.2d 467.\n\nLiquor wholesalers have a superpriority lien over all lien holders, with the exception of the New Mexico taxation and revenue department, if the tax lien is perfected pursuant to Section 7-1-38 NMSA 1978. The tax lien is effective as of the date the notice is filed.D & M, Inc. v. United N.M. Bank, 114 B.R. 274 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1990).\n\nLiquor wholesalers' superpriority liens created by this section were prior to a bank's perfected security interest even if there was a violation of Section 60-7A-9 NMSA 1978, governing credit extension by wholesalers.D & M, Inc. v. United N.M. Bank, 114 B.R. 274 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1990).\n\nThis section does not allow the wholesaler to claim priority for each subsequent sale as of the date of the first transaction. Instead, each separate credit sale creates a separate lien. All liens other than tax liens become subordinate to the wholesaler's liens regardless of the date of perfection.D & M, Inc. v. United N.M. Bank, 114 B.R. 274 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1990).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —Security interests in liquor licenses, 56 A.L.R.4th 1131.",

Prior to the approval of the issuance of a new license, and prior to the approval of a transfer permitted by Section 60-6B-3 or 60-6B-12 NMSA 1978, the director shall notify the governing body of the director's preliminary approval of the issuance or transfer of the license. Notice to the governing body shall be by certified mail.\n\nB. A governing body that has received a notice of preliminary approval of the issuance or transfer of a license from the department may approve or disapprove the issuance or transfer of the license in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\nC. Within forty-five days after receipt of a notice of preliminary approval from the department, the governing body shall hold a public hearing on the question of whether the department should approve the proposed issuance or transfer.\n\nD. The governing body shall give notice of the public hearing, as required by Subsection C of this section, and the notice shall:\n\n(1) be published at least twice, with the initial notice published at least thirty days before the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation within the territorial limits of the governing body;\n\n(2) in addition to required print publication, be published on a local option district's web site, if the district has a web site;\n\n(3) set forth:\n\n(a) the date, time and place of the hearing;\n\n(b) the name and address of the licensee;\n\n(c) the action proposed to be taken by the department;\n\n(d) the location of the licensee's premises; and\n\n(e) such other information as may be required by the department; and\n\n(4) be sent by certified mail to the applicant.\n\nE. The governing body may designate a hearing officer to conduct the hearing. A record shall be made of the hearing.\n\nF. The governing body may disapprove the issuance or transfer of the license if:\n\n(1) the proposed location is within an area where the sale of alcoholic beverages is prohibited by the laws of New Mexico;\n\n(2) the issuance or transfer would be in violation of a zoning or other ordinance of the governing body; or\n\n(3) the issuance or transfer would be detrimental to the public health, safety or morals of the residents of the local option district.\n\nG. Within thirty days after the public hearing, the governing body shall notify the department as to whether the governing body has approved or disapproved the proposed issuance or transfer of the license. If the governing body fails to either approve or disapprove the issuance or transfer of the license within thirty days after the public hearing, the director may give final approval to the issuance or transfer of the license.\n\nH. If the governing body disapproves the issuance or transfer of the license, it shall notify the department within the time required by Subsection G of this section setting forth the reasons for the disapproval. A copy of the minutes of the public hearing shall be submitted to the department by the governing body with the notice of disapproval. If the governing body disapproves of the issuance or transfer of the license, the director shall disapprove the issuance or transfer of the license.\n\nI. If the governing body approves the issuance or transfer of the license, it shall notify the department within the time required by Subsection G of this section of its approval. If the governing body approves of the issuance or transfer of the license, the director shall approve the issuance or transfer of the license.\n\nHistory:Laws 1981, ch. 39, § 40; 2015, ch. 102, § 6.\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective July 1, 2015, changed the notice requirements for a hearing prior to the approval of the issuance of a new liquor license or of a transfer of a liquor license; in Subsection A, after \"prior to the approval of\", deleted \"any\" and added \"a\", after \"Section\", deleted \"39 or 113 of the Liquor Control Act\" and added \"60-6B-3 or 60-6B-12 NMSA 1978\", after \"governing body of\", deleted \"his\" and added \"the director's\"; in Subsection B, after \"governing body\", deleted \"which\" and added \"that\"; in the introductory sentence of Subsection D, after \"D.\", deleted \"Notice of the public hearing required by Subsection C of this section shall be given by\", and after \"governing body\", deleted \"by\" and added \"shall give notice of the public hearing, as required by Subsection C of this section, and the notice shall\"; in Paragraph (1) of Subsection D, after \"(1)\", deleted \"publishing a notice of the date, time and place of the hearing at least once a week for two consecutive weeks\" and added \"be published at least twice, with the initial notice published at least thirty days before the hearing\", and after the semicolon, deleted \"The notice shall\"; added Paragraph (2) of Subsection D; redesignated the phrase \"set forth:\" as Paragraph (3) of Subsection D; added new Subparagraph D(3)(a) and redesignated the succeeding subparagraphs accordingly; deleted the paragraph designation from former Paragraph (2) of Subsection D and deleted \"sending a notice\"; designated the language from former Paragraph (2) of Subsection D as Paragraph (4) of Subsection D; in Paragraph (4) of Subsection D, after \"(4)\", added \"be sent\", and after \"mail to the applicant\", deleted \"of the date, time and place of the public hearing\".\n\nMotion to intervene held timely.— Indian tribe political chapter's motion to intervene on appeal in a liquor license transfer case was timely filed, where the proposed transfer site was located within the geographical boundaries of the chapter, and the chapter wished to argue on behalf of the state's position on appeal.Thriftway Mktg. Corp. v. State, 1990-NMCA-115, 111 N.M. 763, 810 P.2d 349.\n\nFormal preservation of error not required.— Because applicants at administrative hearings often are not represented by legal counsel, state statutes do not require formal preservation of error before appeal may be taken from these decisions.Dick v. City of Portales, 1994-NMSC-092, 118 N.M. 541, 883 P.2d 127.\n\nSame standard applicable to transfers and issuance of new licenses.— Once voters approve the sale of alcoholic beverages in a community and the proposed location meets zoning and ordinance requirements, denial of either the transfer of a license, or issuance of a new license, must be based on a finding of health, safety, or moral hazards at the location.City of Santa Fe v. Woodard, 1996-NMSC-058, 122 N.M. 449, 926 P.2d 302.\n\nTransfer of license despite municipal disapproval.— Under the Liquor Control Act, Section 60-3A-1 NMSA 1978, the director of the alcohol and gaming division of the New Mexico regulation and licensing department may approve a transfer of a license despite municipal disapproval. The director must so act if the governing body fails to submit evidence supporting its decision or if, on its face, the governing body's decision is not based on evidence pertaining to the specific prospective transferee or location.Southland Corp. v. Manzagol, 1994-NMSC-099, 118 N.M. 423, 882 P.2d 14.\n\nCity's disapproval of new license not supported by evidence.— Since there was an absence of substantial evidence to support the conclusion of negative impact upon the health, safety, or morals of residents of the area, the city's disapproval of a restaurant license to sell beer and wine was properly disregarded by the director.City of Santa Fe v. Woodard, 1996-NMSC-058, 122 N.M. 449, 926 P.2d 302.\n\nDay care and transfer of liquor license.— Where evidence was presented to the hearing officers showing that a day care was not an accredited institution and that its employees and owner were not licensed teachers, there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the day care was not a \"school\" for the purposes of a liquor license transfer.Concerned Residents for Neighborhood Inc. v. Shollenbarger, 1991-NMCA-105, 113 N.M. 667, 831 P.2d 603,overruled on other grounds byRegents of Univ. of N.M. v. Hughes, 1992-NMSC-049, 114 N.M. 304, 838 P.2d 458.\n\nDiscretion of director.— The word \"may\" as used in Subsection G invests the director with discretion as to whether to give final approval to the issuance or transfer of a license when a governing body of a county has failed to either approve or disapprove the issuance or transfer of the license within 30 days after a public hearing.Thriftway Mktg. Corp. v. State, 1992-NMCA-092, 114 N.M. 578, 844 P.2d 828.\n\nDisapproval of transfer.— City council's decision to disapprove transfer of a liquor license as part of the administrative licensing process had to be supported by substantial evidence using whole record review.Dick v. City of Portales, 1994-NMSC-092, 118 N.M. 541, 883 P.2d 127.\n\nDisapproval of transfer based on moral considerations.— To support a disapproval of the transfer of ownership of a liquor license alone, any detriment to the morals of the residents of the local option district must relate to the qualifications of the transferee to hold the license.Dick v. City of Portales, 1994-NMSC-092, 118 N.M. 541, 883 P.2d 127.\n\nIn a proceeding regarding the transfer of a liquor license, testimony that a greater availability of alcohol would increase the possibility of accidents involving harm in the community was based upon speculation and was irrelevant; it was relevant, if at all, only to general safety concerns and was unsubstantiated with statistics based on facts relevant to the local community. Disapproval of a liquor license transfer must be based upon authentic facts related to a specific prospective licensee or location.Town & Country Food Stores, Inc. v. Hughes, 1994-NMSC-093, 118 N.M. 545, 883 P.2d 131.\n\nThe city commission failed to support its finding that the particular liquor license transfer would be detrimental to the safety of the residents and therefore its disapproval was invalid.Town & Country Food Stores, Inc. v. Hughes, 1994-NMSC-093, 118 N.M. 545, 883 P.2d 131.\n\nConstitutionality of moral considerations.— The delegation to a municipality of the legislative authority to disapprove the transfer of a liquor license on moral as well as on safety and health grounds is within the traditional definition of the state's police power and thus constitutional.Dick v. City of Portales, 1993-NMCA-125, 116 N.M. 472, 863 P.2d 1093,rev'd on other grounds, 1994-NMSC-092, 118 N.M. 541, 883 P.2d 127.\n\nNo authority to restrict licensee's operation as condition for approval of waiver.— This section confers no express authority on local government to limit or restrict the operation of a licensee as a condition for approving the waiver of the distance requirement imposed by the predecessor of Section 60-6B-10 NMSA 1978, nor can such authority be inferred in view of the state's preemptive role in the regulation of liquor establishments. 1980 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 80-23.\n\nDelegation of liquor law functions to local governments strictly construed.— Although there is no present question concerning the propriety of certain statutes delegating liquor law functions to local governments, such statutes must be strictly construed against any greater delegation of legislative power than clearly appears in the language used. 1980 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 80-23.",

A license may be granted for a proposed licensed premises if a person has obtained a waiver from a local option district governing body for the proposed licensed premises. A license may be granted for a proposed licensed premises if a person has obtained a restaurant A license or a restaurant B license pursuant to Section 60-6A-4 NMSA 1978. For the purposes of this section, all measurements taken in order to determine the location of licensed premises in relation to churches or schools shall be the straight line distance from the property line of the licensed premises to the property line of the church or school. This provision shall not apply to a church that has been designated as a historical site by the cultural properties review committee and that does not have a regular congregation.\n\nHistory:Laws 1981, ch. 39, § 45; 1986, ch. 29, § 1; 1997, ch. 223, § 1; 2021, ch. 7, § 34.\n\nCross references.— For cultural properties review committee, see 18-6-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective July 1, 2021, provided that a license may be granted for a \"proposed licensed premises\" if a person has obtained a restaurant A license or a restaurant B license; and added \"A license may be granted for a proposed licensed premises if a person has obtained a restaurant A license or a restaurant B license pursuant to Section 60-6A-4 NMSA 1978.\".\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective June 20, 1998, deleted \"before the effective date of the Liquor Control Act\" at the end of the third sentence, deleted the former fourth and fifth sentences relating to a waiver being granted for licensed premises of at least fifteen stories in class A counties after the effective date of that act, and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nThe phrase \"property line of the licensed premises\" in Section 60-6B-10 NMSA 1978refers to the outer boundary of the licensed premises themselves, that is, the premises actually used to sell, serve, or consume alcohol.City of Santa Fe v. Tomada, 2014-NMCA-022, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-001.\n\nMeasurement to the boundary of the licensed premises.— Where the straight-line distance from the actual licensed premises to the north boundary of the school grounds was 377.53 feet and the straight-line distance from the boundary of the real property on which the licensed premised was located to the school grounds was 155.05 feet, the location of the licensed premises did not violate the distance prohibition of Section 60-6B-10 NMSA 1978.City of Santa Fe v. Tomada, 2014-NMCA-022, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-001.\n\nSection applies to transfer of license.— Although Section 60-6B-2 NMSA 1978 and this section refer only to a license \"issued\", the sections apply equally to the transfer of a license; therefore, the decision by the director of the alcohol and gaming division of the regulation and licensing deparment granting an application for transfer of a liquor license was reviewable by way of the statutory appeal provided in Subsection M (now Q) of 60-6B-2 NMSA 1978.Regents of Univ. of N.M. v. Hughes, 1992-NMSC-049, 114 N.M. 304, 838 P.2d 458.\n\nFunctional test to be used.— Courts should apply a functional test to decide whether property located within 300 feet of a proposed licensed premises is or is not a school; however, this does not mean that only the building or other structure used for educational purposes falls within the definition of \"school\" and that adjacent property, even if used for a parking lot, may not be considered as meeting the functional test: any such adjacent land used for school purposes, which may include the parking of vehicles used by students in attending classes or otherwise participating in educational or instructional activities, may fall within the definition of \"school\".Regents of Univ. of N.M. v. Hughes, 1992-NMSC-049, 114 N.M. 304, 838 P.2d 458.\n\nStandards for waiver must be defined and uniformly applied.— Any action taken by a home rule municipality to condition its consent to waive the distance requirement of this section must have uniform application to all persons requesting the waiver and must contain definable standards for the imposition of those conditions. 1980 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 80-23.\n\nWaiver may not be conditioned on restriction of operations.— There is no express authority for a local government to limit or restrict the operation of a licensee as a condition for approving the waiver of the distance requirement imposed by this section, nor can such authority be inferred in view of the state's preemptive role in the regulation of liquor establishments. 1980 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 80-23.\n\nTo determine proximity of proposed liquor establishmentto an established church or school, the measurement should be made between the limits of the real property of the church or school within which the ordinary and usual activities incident to such institutions are conducted and that portion of the structure in which alcoholic beverages are actually to be sold. 1974 Op.
