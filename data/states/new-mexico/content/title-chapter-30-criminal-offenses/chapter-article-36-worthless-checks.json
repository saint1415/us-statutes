Cruz, 2011-NMSC-038, 150 N.M. 548, 263 P.3d 890,rev'g2010-NMCA-011, 147 N.M. 753, 228 P.3d 1173.\n\nA violation of the Worthless Check Act does not require a contemporaneous transaction.State v.

Cruz, 2011-NMSC-038, 150 N.M. 548, 263 P.3d 890,rev'g2010-NMCA-011, 147 N.M. 753, 228 P.3d 1173.\n\nChecks issued to members of an Indian tribe.— Where defendant issued checks to pay the wages of three members of an Indian tribe for performing work on a construction project that was located on Indian land; the checks were delivered to the payees on Indian land; the checks were signed by defendant outside Indian land; defendant gave the checks to an employee of defendant's construction company at a meeting place that was located outside Indian land for delivery to the payees; the payees cashed the checks at a store that was located outside Indian land; and defendant's bank dishonored the checks for insufficient funds, New Mexico had jurisdiction to prosecute defendant for issuing worthless checks.State v.

Cruz, 2010-NMCA-011, 147 N.M. 753, 228 P.3d 1173,rev'd, 2011-NMSC-038, 150 N.M. 548, 263 P.3d 890.\n\nSection not void for vagueness.— This section gives one notice of the prohibited act; it is not void for vagueness.State v. Libero, 1978-NMCA-055, 91 N.M. 780, 581 P.2d 873, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324.\n\n\"Issue\" and \"giving\" same.— The term \"issue\" in this section is used in the same sense as \"giving\" a check in 30-36-3 NMSA 1978, and \"giving\" a worthless check constitutes a representation that the drawer has credit with the drawee bank for the amount involved.State v. Libero, 1978-NMCA-055, 91 N.M. 780, 581 P.2d 873, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324.\n\n\"Issue\" and \"give\" mean delivery to holder with passing of interestfrom one to another. To violate this section, one must issue the check in exchange for value, with the requisite intent and knowledge.State v. Libero, 1978-NMCA-055, 91 N.M. 780, 581 P.2d 873, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324.\n\nTiming of delivery of goods/services and issuance of checks.— The fact that the goods and services were delivered before the check was issued did not signify that an exchange did not occur within the meaning of this section. A worthless check is given for something of value if the worthless check is issued as part of a contemporaneous transaction between the parties in which something of value is exchanged for the check, without regard to whether the thing of value is delivered before or after the worthless check is issued.State v. Platt, 1992-NMCA-110, 114 N.M. 721, 845 P.2d 815, cert. denied, 114 N.M. 501, 841 P.2d 549.\n\nSection inapplicable to postdated checks.— Where neither evidence nor inference contradicts testimony that a check was postdated, defendant's motion to dismiss the charge as to the check should be sustained as the Worthless Check Act does not apply to postdated checks.State v. Downing, 1971-NMCA-122, 83 N.M. 62, 488 P.2d 112.\n\nFalse pretenses.— Giving a worthless check constitutes a representation that the drawer has credit with the drawee bank for the amount involved, and such representation relates to an existing fact, so that under former law a prosecution for obtaining money by false pretenses could be maintained.State v. Tanner, 1917-NMSC-017, 22 N.M. 493, 164 P. 821.\n\nFinding of intent to defraud was supported by evidencewhere defendant cashed a $20.00 check on a bank in which he had no account, the next day cashed a $75.00 check on another bank with which he had just opened an account and made a $25.00 deposit, and on the following morning before leaving town without checking out of motel cashed a $35.00 check on that bank.State v. McKay, 1969-NMCA-009, 79 N.M. 797, 450 P.2d 435.\n\nIntent lacking.— To issue a check in payment of an outstanding account, where credit was not given on the strength of check so issued, was not a violation of the statute, because there was no intent to defraud which is the gist of the offense.State v. Davis, 1921-NMSC-003, 26 N.M. 523, 194 P. 882.\n\nSufficient bank credit.— Conviction for issuance of a fraudulent check was reversed upon evidence showing an arrangement with the bank whereby defendant was to deposit drafts drawn on various commission houses, and the bank was to honor checks drawn by defendant, and that at the time the check was presented, defendant's credit with the bank was sufficient, according to the bank's own records, to cover it.State v. Thompson, 1933-NMSC-021, 37 N.M. 229, 20 P.2d 1030.\n\nCompulsion as defense.— Where defendant claimed that an individual who was \"bigger and tougher\" than he forced him to write and cash a bad check under threat of bodily harm, and that this person was present in the store when he cashed the check, but store employees testified that defendant came into the store alone, defense of compulsion failed.State v. Lee, 1967-NMCA-017, 78 N.M. 421, 432 P.2d 265.\n\nKnowledge of motel clerk.— Whether motel clerk knew, had been expressly notified or had reason to believe that defendant did not have sufficient funds on deposit in the bank to insure payment on presentation of the check was for the jury to decide.State v. McKay, 1969-NMCA-009, 79 N.M. 797, 450 P.2d 435.\n\nInformation sufficient.— Where information charged defendant with issuing worthless checks contrary to this section and 30-36-5B NMSA 1978, reference to the latter section was surplusage, since the information was sufficient without reference to the penalty.State v. Ferris, 1969-NMCA-093, 80 N.M. 663, 459 P.2d 462.\n\nMalicious prosecution action not maintainable.— One charged with having issued a fraudulent check or draft cannot maintain a malicious prosecution action where he has obtained dismissal of charge by voluntarily paying the claim and costs of prosecution.Marchbanks v. Young, 1943-NMSC-024, 47 N.M. 213, 139 P.2d 594.\n\nCourt inquiry into defendant's consideration of bankruptcy might constitute reversible error.— In a trial for issuing worthless checks, the court's inquiry into defendant's consideration of bankruptcy might well have detracted from the presumption of innocence to which defendant was entitled, and constituted reversible error, because his answers may have tainted the opinion of the jury in deciding whether or not defendant's disavowals of intent to deceive or knowledge of insufficient funds should be believed in view of his past history as a debtor.State v. Caputo, 1980-NMCA-032, 94 N.M. 190, 608 P.2d 166.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 32 Am.

Ferris, 1969-NMCA-093, 80 N.M. 663, 459 P.2d 462.\n\nTotaling provisions severable.— While the \"totaling\" provisions of this section are void, they may be severed from this section, leaving the remaining portion thereof consistent with 30-36-4 NMSA 1978, which makes an offense out of each worthless check issued.State v. Ferris, 1969-NMCA-093, 80 N.M. 663, 459 P.2d 462.\n\nFrivolous to infer rest of statute unconstitutionally vague.— An inference that because the totaling provision of this section was held unconstitutionally vague, other parts of the Worthless Check Act (30-36-1 to 30-36-9 NMSA 1978) are also unconstitutionally vague was frivolous.State v. Libero, 1978-NMCA-055, 91 N.M. 780, 581 P.2d 873, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324.\n\nQuashing of information unwarranted.— The trial court correctly held that defendant could not be punished under Subsection B of this section by \"totaling\" two checks, but erred in quashing the information, since defendant could still be punished for each worthless check that he had issued.State v. Conners, 1969-NMCA-096, 80 N.M. 662, 459 P.2d 461.\n\nSince defendant was convicted of issuing four worthless checks, he could have been sentenced for each offense under the portion of this section remaining after severance of the provisions on totaling; therefore, the trial court erred in dismissing the information.State v. Ferris, 1969-NMCA-093, 80 N.M. 663, 459 P.2d 462.\n\nReinstatement of charges not double jeopardy.— Dismissal of the information before the entering of a plea because of the unconstitutional vagueness of the \"totaling\" provision of this section did not place defendant in jeopardy, and, therefore, reinstatement of the information did not subject him to double jeopardy.State v. Ferris, 1969-NMCA-093, 80 N.M. 663, 459 P.2d 462.\n\nFelony degree for violation of Subsection B.— The offense of issuing a worthless check over $25.00 is a \"felony\" but could not constitute a \"fourth degree felony\" because the minimum sentence imposed for issuing worthless checks is less than the stated sentence for fourth degree felonies.State v. Muzio, 1987-NMCA-006, 105 N.M. 352, 732 P.2d 879.\n\nSentence not severable.— A sentence of six to eight years for utterance of fraudulent checks by habitual criminal could not be considered a sentence of five years for uttering fraudulent checks since judgment was not severable.Jordan v. Swope, 1932-NMSC-015, 36 N.M. 84, 8 P.2d 788.\n\nTotaling provisions vague.— The cumulative provisions in this section relating to penalties are vague, indefinite and uncertain. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen.

Young, 1943-NMSC-024, 47 N.M. 213, 139 P.2d 594.\n\nPrima facie presumption inapplicable without notice.— Where although defendant unquestionably had insufficient funds in his account with a bank to cover a $35.00 check, the state failed to prove that defendant had received notice of dishonor at least 10 days (now 3 days) before trial, the state could not rely on the prima facie evidence rule as to intent to defraud set forth in Subsection B of this section.State v. McKay, 1969-NMCA-009, 79 N.M. 797, 450 P.2d 435.\n\nPrima facie intent to defraud.— Where the only evidence relative to the dishonor of a $20.00 check was that it was dishonored because defendant had no account in the bank on which it was drawn, there was prima facie intent to defraud under Subsection A.State v. McKay, 1969-NMCA-009, 79 N.M. 797, 450 P.2d 435.\n\nIntent to defraud.— Evidence that defendant entered store and after furnishing identification cashed $25.00 check drawn on a Texas bank with which he had no account or credit was prima facie evidence of an intent to defraud under this section.State v. Lee, 1967-NMCA-017, 78 N.M. 421, 432 P.2d 265.\n\nEffect of discharge in bankruptcy.— On its face, this act addresses the passing of worthless checks with the intent to defraud, and a defendant's prosecution for violation of such law is not precluded by filing for or obtaining a discharge in bankruptcy.State v. Muzio, 1987-NMCA-006, 105 N.M. 352, 732 P.2d 879.\n\nPurpose of notice.— Under the language of the Worthless Check Act the purpose of notice and of the 10-day period (now 3 business days) is to make it easier for the state, upon prosecution, to prove necessary knowledge and intent; such knowledge and intent can, however, be proved without use of the statutory act if desired. 1965 Op.

No. 65-197.\n\nThreat of prosecution not authorized.— The specific language of Section 30-22-6 NMSA 1978, relating to compounding a crime, controls over the more general language of the Worthless Check Act by making it a crime to include in the notice of dishonor a threat to institute criminal proceedings unless payment is made within 10 days (now 3 business days). 1965 Op.
