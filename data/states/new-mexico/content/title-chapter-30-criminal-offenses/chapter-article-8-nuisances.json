      "text": "A public nuisance consists of knowingly creating, performing or maintaining anything affecting any number of citizens without lawful authority which is either:\n\nA. injurious to public health, safety, morals or welfare; or\n\nB. interferes with the exercise and enjoyment of public rights, including the right to use public property.\n\nWhoever commits a public nuisance for which the act or penalty is not otherwise prescribed by law is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-8-1, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 8-1.\n\nCross references.— For polluting of water being public nuisance,see30-8-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor provisions on abatement of public nuisance,see30-8-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor conduct offensive to public well-being,see30-8-12 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor house of prostitution being public nuisance,see30-9-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor gambling and gambling houses being public nuisance,see30-19-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor provision making forest fire burning without proper precaution a public nuisance,see30-32-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nNuisance must affect group of people.— A public nuisance must affect a considerable number of people or an entire community or neighborhood.Environmental Improvement Div. v. Bloomfield Irrigation Dist., 1989-NMCA-049, 108 N.M. 691, 778 P.2d 438, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 681, 777 P.2d 1325.\n\nThis section applies to \"anything affecting any number of citizens\", which means a considerable number of people or an entire community or neighborhood.State ex rel. Vill. of Los Ranchos de Albuquerque v. City of Albuquerque, 1994-NMSC-126, 119 N.M. 150, 889 P.2d 185.\n\nAnticipatory nuisance.— Anticipatory nuisance is a valid cause of action.State ex rel. Vill. of Los Ranchos de Albuquerque v. City of Albuquerque, 1994-NMSC-126, 119 N.M. 150, 889 P.2d 185.\n\nActs of municipality under governmental authority.— In the absence of a showing of fraud, collusion, or illegality, a city's constitutional and statutory authority to construct public highways and bridges constitutes a valid defense to a claim of nuisance per se.City of Albuquerque v. State ex rel. Vill. of Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, 1991-NMCA-015, 111 N.M. 608, 808 P.2d 58, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 524, 828 P.2d 957 (1992).\n\nActs which the law authorized to be done, if carried out and maintained in the manner authorized by law, where a public entity acts under its governmental authority, do not constitute public nuisances per se.City of Albuquerque v. State ex rel. Vill. of Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, 1991-NMCA-015, 111 N.M. 608, 808 P.2d 58, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 524, 828 P.2d 957 (1992).\n\nAbsent a showing that a project is, or will be, conducted or maintained in a manner contrary to law, a city is lawfully empowered to initiate and construct such project, and the project is not subject to abatement as a public nuisance per se, because the construction, operation, and maintenance of a highway or bridge in a lawful manner does not constitute a public nuisance.City of Albuquerque v. State ex rel. Vill. of Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, 1991-NMCA-015, 111 N.M. 608, 808 P.2d 58, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 524, 828 P.2d 957 (1992).\n\nPublic works as public nuisance.— Public works projects are fundamentally different from private construction projects. A public project carries with it the presumption that it is for the public good; proof that it will be a nuisance must be balanced against its benefit for the public as a whole.State ex rel. Vill. of Los Ranchos de Albuquerque v. City of Albuquerque, 1994-NMSC-126, 119 N.M. 150, 889 P.2d 185.\n\nDue authorization of public works.— If the public works project is in existence and poses a present nuisance, due authorization is a qualified defense; courts may or may not decide that despite the defense the project is still a nuisance. However, if the project has yet to be constructed and is challenged as an anticipatory nuisance in fact, due authorization is an absolute defense; courts will summarily conclude that there is no basis for a finding of nuisance.State ex rel. Vill. of Los Ranchos de Albuquerque v. City of Albuquerque, 1994-NMSC-126, 119 N.M. 150, 889 P.2d 185.\n\nContamination of underground water.— Where a sewage treatment facility is operated by a city in a manner which results in the contamination of the underground water to such a degree that it is offensive or dangerous for human consumption or use, is injurious to public health, safety and welfare and interferes with the exercise and enjoyment of public rights, including the right to use public property, the city has created a public nuisance within the meaning of this section. Relief in the nature of a mandatory injunction requiring abatement of the nuisance by ordering the city to extend its waterlines to residences in and outside its limits free of hookup charges would not be a \"donation\" in violation of N.M. Const., art. IX, § 14.State ex rel. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n v. City of Hobbs, 1974-NMSC-064, 86 N.M. 444, 525 P.2d 371.\n\nShooting range.— Use of private property as a trap shooting range was not a \"public right,\" and, thus, the actions of adjoining landowners in making complaints to the sheriff who shut down the range for an investigation did not support a claim under this section.State ex rel. Smith v. Riley, 1997-NMCA-063, 123 N.M. 453, 942 P.2d 721.\n\nEntrance to house.— \"Stoop\" or concrete platform 14 1/2 inches off ground located outside back door of premises which was only means of entrance and exit was not a public nuisance as defined by statute, nor a private nuisance.Jellison v. Gleason, 1967-NMSC-033, 77 N.M. 445, 423 P.2d 876.\n\nIllegal sale of alcoholic beverages is not a statutory nuisanceper se nor is it a common law nuisance per se.State v. Davis, 1958-NMSC-130, 65 N.M. 128, 333 P.2d 613.\n\nDamages.— Compensatory damages are not available for statutory public nuisance, as abatement of the nuisance is the prescribed remedy.New Mexico v. General Elec. Co., 335 F. Supp. 2d 1185 (D.N.M. 2004).\n\nRemedy in public nuisance actions.— In public nuisance cases, abatement of the nuisance is the remedy prescribed by statute, but damages, including noneconomic damages, may be appropriate in actions involving mixed public and private nuisances, so long as the plaintiff can show that they have suffered harm of a kind different from that suffered by other members of the public exercising the right common to the general public that was the subject of the interference. 2024 Op. Atty Gen. No. 2024-05.\n\nLaunching rockets.— Construction and launching of rockets without adequate supervision and without adequate safeguards being provided to protect the persons involved as well as other persons and property which could be harmed by such a dangerous mechanism would be a public nuisance under this section. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-134.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"The Availability of the Affirmative Defenses of Assumption of Risk and the 'Sale Defense' Against Common Law Public Nuisance Actions; United States v.

The use of uniform traffic citations is authorized for the enforcement of this section.

A civil action to abate a public nuisance may be brought, by verified complaint in the name of the state without cost, by any public officer or private citizen, in the district court of the county where the public nuisance exists, against any person, corporation or association of persons who shall create, perform or maintain a public nuisance.\n\nC. When judgment is against the defendant in an action to abate a public nuisance, he shall be adjudged to pay all court costs and a reasonable fee for the complainant's attorney, when the suit is not prosecuted exclusively by the attorney general or a district attorney.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-8-5, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 8-5.\n\nCross references.— For control of contagious diseases and dangerous conditions by health authorities,see24-1-15 to 24-1-19, 24-1-21 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor admissibility of evidence in proceedings hereunder,see30-9-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor procedure in seeking injunction,seeRules 1-065 and 1-066 NMRA.\n\nInjunction authorized.— Injunctive relief could be employed to protect the public health, morals, safety and welfare from irreparable injury by a public nuisance.State ex rel. Marron v. Compere, 1940-NMSC-041, 44 N.M. 414, 103 P.2d 273.\n\nCrime not enjoinable as such.— Where a ground of equitable jurisdiction to enjoin otherwise exists, the claim to such relief is not to be denied merely because the act complained of constitutes a crime, but a crime may not in and of itself be made an independent ground for injunction; hence, trial court could not extend authority of its restraint against defendant from maintaining a certain premises for purposes of lewdness, assignation or prostitution throughout entire county, and its attempt to do so fell squarely within the interdiction that equity may not be employed to forestall the commission of a crime.State v. Robertson, 1957-NMSC-060, 63 N.M. 74, 313 P.2d 342.\n\nMotion picture.— Injunction of motion picture as nuisance because of \"lewdness\" would be in the nature of censorship and prior restraint.State ex rel. Murphy v. Morley, 1957-NMSC-087, 63 N.M. 267, 317 P.2d 317.\n\nBond as enforcement device.— A trial judge has both the statute and the discretion inherent in his broad equitable powers to draw upon in providing means for the enforcement of order restraining defendant from using, occupying or maintaining a certain premises for purposes of lewdness, assignation or prostitution, by requiring a bond of defendant, so long as its effect is confined to the premises in question.State v. Robertson, 1957-NMSC-060, 63 N.M. 74, 313 P.2d 342.\n\nCivil action.— Action brought under general equity powers for protection of public morals is a civil action.State ex rel. Murphy v. Morley, 1957-NMSC-087, 63 N.M. 267, 317 P.2d 317.\n\nStanding to sue for pollution abatement.— Action brought by attorney general and certain private citizens for injunction to abate alleged public nuisance caused by emissions from coal-burning power plant should have been dismissed in trial court since environmental improvement agency (now environment department) had primary jurisdiction over pollution control and means were available to compel agency to perform its duties, should it fail to do so.State ex rel. Norvell v. Arizona Pub. Serv. Co., 1973-NMSC-051, 85 N.M. 165, 510 P.2d 98.\n\nSufficiency of complaint.— Where the nuisance complained of is a nuisance per se, and denounced as such in the statute, it is sufficient for the complaint to allege its existence in the language of the statute.State v. Robertson, 1957-NMSC-060, 63 N.M. 74, 313 P.2d 342.\n\nInjunction power of court.— Injunction under general equity powers of court to protect public morals could not be had where complaint was brought under statute providing for injunction and abatement of nuisance and forfeiture of premises on proof that \"lewdness, assignation or prostitution\" existed there.State ex rel. Murphy v. Morley, 1957-NMSC-087, 63 N.M. 267, 317 P.2d 317.\n\nRecovery of pecuniary damages is not providedby this section.

Supp. 838 (D.N.M. 1994).\n\nStatute provides alternative means for abating noxious odors.— Where air quality standards or regulations have not been established as to what constitutes \"air pollution\" and thus no violation of the Air Quality Control Act (Sections 74-2-1 to 74-2-17 NMSA 1978) or regulations and standards is apparent, the public nuisance law may provide an alternative means for the environmental improvement division (now environment department) to abate noxious odors. 1978 Op.

      "text": "A. When the public nuisance sought to be abated under the provisions of Section 30-8-8 NMSA 1978 is a house of prostitution, as defined in Section 30-9-8 NMSA 1978, in addition to injunctive relief, the remedies and presumptions provided in this section apply.\n\nB. For the purposes of this section and Section 30-8-8 NMSA 1978, two or more convictions of any person or persons occurring at least one week apart within a period of one year for violation of either Section 30-9-2 or 30-9-3 NMSA 1978 arising out of conduct engaged in at the place described in an abatement action creates a presumption that the place is a house of prostitution. However, this presumption shall not arise unless the person against whom the abatement action is brought is shown to have had actual knowledge or to have received written notice from law enforcement officials of the convictions upon which the presumption is based. The knowledge must have been acquired or the notice given no more than thirty days after the date of the convictions. For the purpose of this section the \"date of the convictions\" is the date upon which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or a judgment of guilty entered in the case charging the crime is final and unappealable.\n\nC. If, in an abatement action brought under Section 30-8-8 NMSA 1978, a binding admission is made by the defendant or the court concludes that a house of prostitution exists at the location alleged, the court may, as part of its judgment:\n\n(1) direct the removal from the house of prostitution all movable personal property used in conducting the house of prostitution and shall direct the sale of that property in the same manner as personal property is sold when seized under a writ of execution; and\n\n(2) order the closing of the house of prostitution for a period of one year and prohibit any person entering it except under conditions specified in the order.\n\nD.
