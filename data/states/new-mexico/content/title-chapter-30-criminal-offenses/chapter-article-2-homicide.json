      "text": "A. Murder in the first degree is the killing of one human being by another without lawful justification or excuse, by any of the means with which death may be caused:\n\n(1) by any kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing;\n\n(2) in the commission of or attempt to commit any felony; or\n\n(3) by any act greatly dangerous to the lives of others, indicating a depraved mind regardless of human life.\n\nWhoever commits murder in the first degree is guilty of a capital felony.\n\nB. Unless he is acting upon sufficient provocation, upon a sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion, a person who kills another human being without lawful justification or excuse commits murder in the second degree if in performing the acts which cause the death he knows that such acts create a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to that individual or another.\n\nMurder in the second degree is a lesser included offense of the crime of murder in the first degree.\n\nWhoever commits murder in the second degree is guilty of a second degree felony resulting in the death of a human being.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-2-1, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 2-1; 1980, ch. 21, § 1; 1994, ch. 23, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For attempt to commit a felony,see30-28-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor homicide by vehicle,see66-8-101 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor homicide instructions,seeUJI 14-201 NMRA et seq.\n\nFor instruction on the essential elements of felony murder,seeUJI 14-202 NMRA.\n\nThe 1994 amendment,effective July 1, 1994, added \"resulting in the death of a human being\" at the end of the last paragraph of Subsection B.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 1994, ch. 23, § 4 provided that the provisions of Laws 1994, ch. 23, § 1 apply only to persons sentenced for crimes committed on or after July 1, 1994.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nDepraved mind murder.— A number of elements must be considered in appraising whether a defendant has displayed the requisite depraved mind pursuant to Section 30-2-1A(3) NMSA 1978. Conviction requires that more than one person be endangered by the defendant's act. The defendant's act must be intentional and of an extremely reckless character. The defendant must possess subjective knowledge that his act was \"greatly dangerous to the lives of others\".State v. Dowling, 2011-NMSC-016, 150 N.M. 110, 257 P.3d 930.\n\nCourts have distinguished depraved mind murder by the number of persons exposed to danger by a defendant's extremely reckless behavior. In general, depraved mind murder convictions have been limited to acts that are dangerous to more than one person. In addition to the number of people endangered, courts have construed depraved mind murder as requiring proof that the defendant had \"subjective knowledge\" that his act was greatly dangerous to the lives of others. This requirement of subjective knowledge serves as proof that the accused \"acted with 'a depraved mind' or 'wicked or malignant heart' and with utter disregard for human life\". To further narrow the class of killings eligible for depraved mind murder, courts have concluded \"that the legislature intended the offense of depraved mind murder to encompass an intensified malice or evil intent.\" In describing that intensified malice, courts have defined the phrase \"depraved mind\" used in the statute and uniform jury instructions as \"[a] corrupt, perverted, or immoral state of mind constituting the highest grade of malice [that equates] with malice in the commonly understood sense of ill will, hatred, spite or evil intent\".State v. Reed, 2005-NMSC-031, 138 N.M. 365, 120 P.3d 447.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Felony murder has its own particular double jeopardy analysis. If the predicate felony and felony murder are unitary, then the predicate felony must be dismissed because it is subsumed within the elements of felony murder.State v. Bernal, 2006-NMSC-050, 140 N.M. 644, 146 P.3d 289.\n\nConvictions of attempted murder and aggravated battery violated double jeopardy.— Where defendant was convicted of attempted murder and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon; defendant's conduct was unitary; the indictment for attempted murder required the state to prove that defendant attempted to commit murder and \"began to do an act which constituted a substantial part of murder\" but failed to commit the offense; the indictment for aggravated battery required the state to prove that defendant touched or applied force to the victims with a deadly weapon intending to injure the victims; the state's theory of the case to support both charges was that defendant beat, stabbed, and slashed the victims; and the state offered the same testimony to prove both charges, the aggravated battery elements were subsumed within the attempted murder elements and defendant's convictions violated the prohibition against double jeopardy.State v. Swick, 2012-NMSC-018, 279 P.3d 747,rev'g2010-NMCA-098, 148 N.M. 895, 242 P.3d 462,overrulingState v. Armendariz, 2006-NMSC-036, 140 N.M. 182, 141 P.3d 526.\n\nIntent.— \"Deliberate intention\" is defined as, arrived at or determined upon as a result of careful thought and the weighing of the consideration for and against the proposed course of action. Intent is subjective and is almost always inferred from other facts in the case, as it is rarely established by direct evidence.State v. Sosa, 2000-NMSC-036, 129 N.M. 767, 14 P.3d 32.\n\nCorpus delicti.— In homicide cases the corpus delicti is established upon proof of the death of the person charged in the information or indictment, and that the death was caused by the criminal act or agency of another. The corpus delicti of a particular offense is established simply by proof that the crime was committed; the identity of the perpetrator is not material.State v. Sosa, 2000-NMSC-036, 129 N.M. 767, 14 P.3d 32.\n\nJury's specification of death penalty is not freakish, capricious, or arbitrarywhere defendant killed the victim in a particularly brutal fashion by striking her in the head three to five times with a sledgehammer and this occurred after the defendant kidnapped the victim by deception, chased her as she attempted to escape and stabbed her two inches deep in the chest with a knife when she struggled, and completely disrobed the victim in an attempt to rape her.State v. Fry, 2006-NMSC-001, 138 N.M. 700, 126 P.3d 516 (decided under prior law).\n\nFair trial.— Where the prosecutor did no more than repeat what the judge had already said to the jury, that is, that the photographs of the victim contained more graphic material than the jurors were allowed to see, and relied on reasonable inferences from the medical investigator's testimony about the graphic nature of the wounds, the prosecutor did not introduce any new information to the jury, and viewing this isolated remark in context with the judge's comments to the jury, with the testimony of the medical investigator, and with the overwhelming evidence of guilt, the remark did not result in a verdict based on passion or prejudice or otherwise deprive defendant of a fair trial.State v. Fry, 2006-NMSC-001, 138 N.M. 700, 126 P.3d 516.\n\nConstitutionality.— Because the statute and court decisions clearly indicate that the element of deliberation is what distinguishes first degree murder from second degree murder, and the distinction between first and second degree murder has been clearly enunciated by the supreme court, this section and former Section 30-2-2 NMSA 1978, relating to malice (now repealed), are not unconstitutional on the grounds that they make impossible an ascertainable distinction between first and second degree murder.State v. Valenzuela, 1976-NMSC-079, 90 N.M. 25, 559 P.2d 402.\n\nNew Mexico Const., art. IV, § 18, relating to the amendment of statutes, did not apply to 40-24-4, 1953 Comp., the former felony murder statute, which was enacted prior to adoption of the constitutional provision.State v. Hines, 1967-NMSC-237, 78 N.M. 471, 432 P.2d 827.\n\nOpen charge of murder gives defendant noticethat he must defend against a charge of unlawfully taking a human life.State v. Stephens, 1979-NMSC-076, 93 N.M. 458, 601 P.2d 428,overruled in part on other grounds byState v. Contreras, 1995-NMSC-056, 120 N.M. 486, 903 P.2d 228.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Defendant's right to freedom from double jeopardy was not violated by punishment for attempted first degree murder, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and criminal sexual penetration.State v. Traeger, 2000-NMCA-015, 128 N.M. 668, 997 P.2d 142,aff'd in part,rev'd in part on other grounds, 2001-NMSC-022, 130 N.M. 618, 29 P.3d 518.\n\nElement of intent is seldom susceptible to direct proof,since it involves the state of mind of the defendant, and it thus may be proved by circumstantial evidence.State v. Manus, 1979-NMSC-035, 93 N.M. 95, 597 P.2d 280,overruled on other grounds bySells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nElements of depraved mind murder.— The elements that are required to support a depraved mind murder conviction are that more than one person must be endangered by defendant's act; defendant's act must be intentional and extremely reckless; defendant must possess subjective knowledge that defendant's act was greatly dangerous to the lives of others; and the act must encompass an intensified malice and evil intent.State v. Dowling, 2011-NMSC-016, 150 N.M. 110, 257 P.3d 930.\n\nSufficient evidence of depraved mind murder.— Where defendant drove a truck at approximately 80 miles per hour for approximately one mile on a four-lane suburban street during the middle of a weekday, striking and injuring a jogger on the street's raised median, then driving onto a sidewalk and striking and killing a second pedestrian; all the while speeding and weaving in and out of traffic, including into oncoming traffic, almost colliding with other vehicles, until defendant crossed all four lanes of the street and finally crashed into a boulder on the raised median, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of depraved mind murder.State v. Dowling, 2011-NMSC-016, 150 N.M. 90, 257 P.3d 930.\n\nAct indicating depraved mind not affected by intent to kill particular individual.— A murder committed by an act which indicates a depraved mind is a first degree murder. The existence of an intent to kill any particular individual does not remove the act from this class of murder.State v. Sena, 1983-NMSC-005, 99 N.M. 272, 657 P.2d 128.\n\nFor legislative history of term \"human being\"in definition of murder, as found throughout homicide statutes.State v. Willis, 1982-NMCA-151, 98 N.M. 771, 652 P.2d 1222.\n\nFair trial.— Defendant's right to fair trial was not violated when, in a prosecution for first degree murder, the state secured an instruction for the lesser included offense of second degree murder and then argued against this lesser included offense at closing, contending that the evidence could only support a first degree murder conviction.State v. Armendarez, 1992-NMSC-012, 113 N.M. 335, 825 P.2d 1245.\n\nCumulative punishment is precluded for shooting at a vehicle and homicide.— New Mexico jurisprudence precludes cumulative punishment for the offenses of causing great bodily harm to a person by shooting at a motor vehicle and the homicide resulting from the penetration of the same bullet into the same person.State v. Montoya, 2013-NMSC-020, 306 P.3d 426,overrulingState v. Gonzales, 1992-NMSC-003, 113 N.M. 221, 824 P.2d 1023,State v. Dominguez, 2005-NMSC-001, 137 N.M. 1, 106 P.3d 563 andState v. Riley, 2010-NMSC-005, 147 N.M. 557, 226 P.3d 656.\n\nWhere defendant and defendant's companions were accosted by a rival gang in front of defendant's family home, guns were pulled on both sides and defendant's sibling was severely wounded by gunshots in the leg and abdomen; while defendant's group were trying to help defendant's sibling in the driveway and stop the bleeding from the gunshot wounds, the person in the rival gang who had been shooting at defendant and defendant's companions returned in a Ford Expedition; when defendant saw gunfire coming from the Expedition, defendant ran into the house and retrieved an AK-47 rifle and began shooting at the Expedition; the driver of Expedition was shot seven times and died; the jury convicted defendant of voluntary manslaughter and shooting into a motor vehicle resulting in great bodily harm, the Double Jeopardy Clause protected defendant from being punished both for the homicide of the victim and for shooting into a vehicle causing great bodily harm to the victim where both convictions were premised on the unitary act of shooting the victim.State v. Montoya, 2013-NMSC-020, 306 P.3d 426,overrulingState v. Gonzales, 1992-NMSC-003, 113 N.M. 221, 824 P.2d 1023,State v. Dominguez, 2005-NMSC-001, 137 N.M. 1, 106 P.3d 563 andState v. Riley, 2010-NMSC-005, 147 N.M. 557, 226 P.3d 656.\n\nLegislature intended to provide multiple punishmentsfor the offenses of second degree murder and shooting into or from a vehicle.State v. Mireles, 2004-NMCA-100, 136 N.M. 337, 98 P.3d 727, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-008, 136 N.M. 492, 100 P.3d 197.\n\nA consideration of second degree murder and shooting from a motor vehicle shows that the sections setting forth these crimes are designed to combat distinct evils, which provides further indicia of legislative intent confirming the presumption that the offenses are separately punishable.State v. Mireles, 2004-NMCA-100, 136 N.M. 337, 98 P.3d 727, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-008, 136 N.M. 492, 100 P.3d 197.\n\nConviction of lesser offense only if supported by evidence.— No statute which purports to authorize an appellate court to sustain a conviction unsupported by the evidence may be approved, and accordingly Laws 1937, ch. 199, § 1 (not compiled), is invalid to the extent that it authorizes a conviction for a lesser included homicide offense when no evidence was contained in the record to prove the essentials of the elements of the offense of which the defendant stands convicted.Smith v. State, 1976-NMSC-085, 89 N.M. 770, 558 P.2d 39.\n\nUnsupported conviction unconstitutional.— A conviction based on a record lacking any relevant evidence as to a crucial element of the offense charged violates due process.Smith v. State, 1976-NMSC-085, 89 N.M. 770, 558 P.2d 39.\n\n\"Torture\".— Murder by strangling and suffocation was not murder by \"torture,\" which was conclusively made first degree murder by Laws 1907, ch. 36, § 1 (40-24-4, 1953 Comp.).State v. Bentford, 1935-NMSC-051, 39 N.M. 293, 46 P.2d 658 (decided under prior law).\n\nConviction of principal in second degree.— A principal in the second degree was guilty of crime the same as the principal in the first degree, and might be tried and convicted, even though the latter has been acquitted or convicted of a lesser degree of the offense.State v. Martino, 1920-NMSC-069, 27 N.M. 1, 192 P. 507.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Defendant's convictions under two theories of first degree murder did not result in contradictory convictions in violation of due process and double jeopardy principles because the two crimes were not inherently or factually contradictory and the jury could have concluded that defendant was guilty under both alternatives, given the evidence.State v. Reyes, 2002-NMSC-024, 132 N.M. 576, 52 P.3d 948.\n\nGuilty verdicts for two alternative theories of first degree murder should be regarded, for sentencing purposes, as a general verdict of first degree murder based on the two theories, thereby avoiding multiple punishments.State v. Reyes, 2002-NMSC-024, 132 N.M. 576, 52 P.3d 948.\n\nConvictions of defendant for both second degree murder and intentional child abuse resulting in death violated his right not to be placed in double jeopardy.State v. Mann, 2000-NMCA-088, 129 N.M. 600, 11 P.3d 564,aff'd, 2002-NMSC-001, 131 N.M. 459, 39 P.3d 124.\n\nDefendant's conviction for both shooting into an occupied motor vehicle under Section 30-3-8 NMSA 1978 and first degree murder under this section was not double jeopardy because the legislature intended to have separate punishments for similar conduct that can result in a violation of both statutes.State v. Gonzales, 1992-NMSC-003, 113 N.M. 221, 824 P.2d 1023.\n\nThere was no double jeopardy violation for convictions for second degree murder and shooting at or from a motor vehicle because the testimony at trial permitted the inference that each conviction was based on distinct conduct and because the two statutes evince legislative intent to impose separate punishments for each crime.State v. Mireles, 2004-NMCA-100, 136 N.M. 337, 98 P.3d 727, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-008, 136 N.M. 492, 100 P.3d 197.\n\nConviction for shooting at a motor vehicle under Section 30-3-8B NMSA 1978 did not preclude the state from seeking a further conviction for first or second degree murder under this section.State v. Garcia, 2005-NMCA-042, 137 N.M. 315, 110 P.3d 531, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-004, 137 N.M. 454, 112 P.3d 1111.\n\nHomicide charge not merged.— The homicide resulting from the great bodily harm was sufficient evidence for the jury to find aggravated sodomy and first degree kidnapping, and there was no merger with the charge of murder of which defendant was acquitted.State v. Melton, 1977-NMSC-014, 90 N.M. 188, 561 P.2d 461.\n\nAggravated burglary and first degree murder not unitary.— First degree murder and aggravated burglary were not unitary acts, and imposition of sentences for both offenses did not violate double jeopardy.State v. Livernois, 1997-NMSC-019, 123 N.M. 128, 934 P.2d 1057.\n\nMerger of lesser offense found.— Where a defendant was charged with numerous counts of child abuse resulting in death or great bodily injury and with murder, but the state did not charge or offer proof that the acts of child abuse arose as separate and distinct episodes, the rule of merger precluded the defendant's conviction and sentence for a crime that is a lesser included offense of a greater charge upon which defendant has also been convicted. Although the state properly may charge in the alternative, where the defendant was convicted of one or more offenses which were merged into the greater offense, he could be punished for only one.State v. Pierce, 1990-NMSC-049, 110 N.M. 76, 792 P.2d 408 (events occurred prior to 1989 amendment to Section 30-6-1 NMSA 1978).\n\nBail.— To be admitted to bail on habeas corpus petition, if proof of capital crime is plain and presumption great, court would not weigh it against other, apparently contradictory, facts and circumstances.Ex parte Wright, 1929-NMSC-093, 34 N.M. 422, 283 P. 53.\n\nProsecutor's comments on defendant's story appropriate.— Prosecutor's comments on the veracity of defendant's story did not deprive defendant of a fair trial. If after a case is presented, the evidence is essentially reduced to which of two conflicting stories is true, a party may reasonably infer, and thus argue, that the other side is lying.State v. Aguilar, 1994-NMSC-046, 117 N.M. 501, 873 P.2d 247, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 859, 115 S. Ct. 168, 130 L. Ed. 2d 105, and cert. denied, 513 U.S. 865, 115 S. Ct. 182, 130 L. Ed. 2d 116 (1994).\n\nII. DELIBERATION AND PREMEDITATION.\n\nSubstantial evidence of deliberate intention.— A deliberate intention refers to the state of mind of the defendant, is rarely subject to proof by direct evidence, and often must be inferred from all the facts and circumstances of the killing.State v. Astorga, 2015-NMSC-007.\n\nWhere law enforcement officer was murdered during a traffic stop, evidence established that defendant had a motive to kill the officer, wanting to avoid arrest because defendant knew that he was wanted on an outstanding warrant, that defendant initially complied with the officer when the officer pulled defendant's vehicle over, that defendant then retrieved his gun while he waited for the officer to approach the vehicle, and when the officer neared the window, defendant fired the gun twice at the officer from point-blank range, that defendant, after the killing, made incriminating statements about having \"blasted that cop\", there was substantial evidence of defendant's deliberate intention to take away the life of the law enforcement officer.State v Astorga, 2015-NMSC-007.\n\nWhere the evidence at trial established that defendant threatened the victim during a confrontation the day prior to the murder and cell phone records revealed that defendant sought out the victim the same morning of the murder, that the victim suffered approximately ninety stab wounds during the attack, indicating that the attack upon victim spanned a prolonged period of time, and that defendant disposed of the murder weapon and clothes he wore during the attack, there was sufficient evidence of defendant's deliberate intent to murder the victim.State v. Smith, 2016-NMSC-007.\n\nSufficient evidence of first-degree deliberate murder.— There was sufficient evidence to allow a trier of fact to reasonably infer that the defendant killed the victim with the deliberate intention to take away her life, where the physical evidence containing a full DNA profile matching defendant was found on the victim's body in semen on her thigh and under the fingernails of her right hand, and also on the paver stone presumed to be the murder weapon, and where evidence of deliberation was established by evidence of a prolonged struggle and a large number of wounds to the victim.State v. Thomas, 2016-NMSC-024.\n\nSufficient evidence of first-degree willful and deliberate murder.— Where defendant was charged with first-degree murder (willful and deliberate), related to the killing of his estranged wife, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's first-degree murder conviction where, at trial, the state presented testimony establishing that strangulation was a likely cause of death that defendant's training as a police officer familiarized him with chokeholds, that defendant and the victim had an abusive relationship where the victim repeatedly informed friends and family of her fear of defendant and concern that he would hurt her or kill her, and that defendant and the victim were involved in a contentious divorce with much dispute about the custody of their children.State v. Farrington, 2020-NMSC-022.\n\nSufficient evidence of deliberate murder.— Where defendant was playing with a folding pocket knife at a party; a fight broke out between defendant and the victim; the victim ran away bleeding heavily and later died at a hospital; defendant made the statement that \"I think I stabbed that fool seven or eight times. I stabbed that fool\"; defendant and defendant's friends acted \"fine, like nothing, like high-fiving each other\"; defendant stabbed the victim thirteen times in the left side of the chest; and the wounds were consistent with a single-edged knife, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of willful and deliberate murder.State v. Guerra, 2012-NMSC-027, 284 P.3d 1076.\n\nWhere an altercation occurred between defendant and the victim; the victim was kneeling on the ground as defendant stood over the victim pointing a rifle at the victim's head; the victim attempted to push the rifle away from the victim's head twice and defendant repositioned the rifle so the rifle it pointed directly at the victim's face; as defendant pointed the rifle at the victim, the victim was pleading with defendant; a witness testified that defendant fired four close range shots directly at the victim; there were five wounds in the victim's body, four of which had penetrated the victim's body; and within an hour after the shooting, defendant interacted with a witness who testified that defendant did not appear to be intoxicated and that defendant made a telephone call to tell someone that defendant would not be at work for a week because defendant was in a \"heap of trouble\", there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that defendant acted with deliberate intent when defendant killed the victim.State v. Largo, 2012-NMSC-015, 278 P.3d 532.\n\nJury could reasonably find that defendant acted with deliberate intent because the physical evidence of the stabbing of the victim showed that the attack was part of a prolonged struggle and that the victim was stabbed multiple times as she tried to escape, and because defendant later made statements that he had hurt, stabbed and murdered a woman.State v. Duran, 2006-NMSC-035, 140 N.M. 94, 140 P.3d 515.\n\nWhere defendant was embittered by the victim's rejection of defendant and the breakup of the relationship between defendant and the victim; defendant tried to hurt the victim by making scandalous accusations to the victim's ex-wife and the police; defendant made methodical plans for a trip from Nevada to New Mexico in pursuit of the victim; defendant surreptitiously followed the victim to the victim's home town in New Mexico and stalked the victim over a period of days; defendant ascertained that the victim was taking an alcohol server class at a local motel, inquired about the time and place of the class, and ascertained when defendant could get the victim alone during a class recess; defendant deliberately lay in wait for the victim; defendant carried a screwdriver with him to the fatal confrontation with the victim; defendant stabbed the victim twenty-one times with the screwdriver; after the stabbing, defendant immediately and calmly walked away and fled the scene of the murder; defendant tried to deceive and evade the authorities; and defendant attempted to concoct a false alibi, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's determination that defendant committed the murder with deliberate intent to kill.State v. Flores, 2010-NMSC-002, 147 N.M. 542, 226 P.3d 641.\n\nSufficient evidence of willful and deliberate murder.— In defendant's trial for first-degree murder for the killing of a police officer and aggravated fleeing, the state presented sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant manifested a deliberate intention to kill the officer, where the evidence established that during a traffic stop, the officer attempted to approach the vehicle when the vehicle suddenly accelerated out of a parking lot, and where defendant later brought the vehicle to a stop and waited for the pursuing officer to catch up, and when the officer approached the vehicle a second time, defendant fired his gun four times at the officer. Moreover, testimony from defendant's accomplice established that prior to the shooting, defendant moved his pistol from a hidden position into a firing position, that defendant stated that he would kill an officer to avoid going back to prison, and that defendant shot the officer twice, paused for a moment, and then shot the officer two more times, which was probative of deliberation and intent to kill.State v. Romero, 2019-NMSC-007.\n\nSufficient evidence to prove identity in first-degree murder trial.— In defendant's trial for first-degree murder, where identity was at issue, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction where the victim's wife and three children witnessed the shooting of victim and testified that defendant was the shooter, where a bystander also testified that she witnessed defendant shoot the victim while he was sitting in a vehicle, and where the state presented physical evidence including a latent print of defendant's palm on the vehicle in which the victim was murdered.State v. Ramirez, 2018-NMSC-003.\n\nInsufficient evidence of deliberate murder.— Where defendant was charged with attempted first degree murder after attending a party that ended with one person dead and the victim seriously injured from multiple gunshot wounds; after arriving at the party, defendant waited outside the hall while defendant's friend went into the hall; defendant was carrying a revolver and the friend was carrying a semiautomatic pistol; when a fight erupted in the hall, defendant walked to the entrance of the hall; defendant's friend shot at the victim several times with the pistol; several witnesses, including the victim, testified that they did not see defendant during the fight; after the shooting started, defendant was seen running with the friend away from the fight as other people were firing at them; defendant returned home and hid the pistol; defendant's friend told the police that defendant had admitted shooting the victim, but at trial denied that defendant had admitted shooting the victim; there was no evidence that defendant had a motive to kill the victim; defendant had a concealed weapon permit; other guests at the party were also carrying weapons; and defendant lied to the police and told one friend not to talk about what happened, the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that defendant acted willfully, deliberately and with premeditated intent to kill the victim.State v. Slade, 2014-NMCA-088, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-008.\n\nWhere defendant and the victims had been drinking and taking drugs earlier in the day; while defendant and the victims were aimlessly driving around, drinking and taking more drugs, defendant, without any evidence of motive, shot and killed the driver and when the passenger, who was sitting in the front seat, screamed and turned around to look at defendant, defendant shot and wounded the passenger; and although multiple shots were fired in quick succession, each victim was shot only once, there was insufficient evidence of deliberation to support defendant's conviction for attempted first degree murder of the passenger.State v. Tafoya, 2012-NMSC-030, 285 P.3d 604.\n\nEvidence of condition of mind of accused at time of crime may be introduced,not only for the purpose of proving the inability to deliberate, but also to prove that the conditions were such that defendant did not in fact, at the time of the killing, form a deliberate intent to kill.State v. Balderama, 2004-NMSC-008, 135 N.M. 329, 88 P.3d 845.\n\nSchizophrenia did not limit defendant's capacity to form deliberate intent to kill.— Where defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and third-degree criminal sexual penetration, based on defendant's admission that he killed the victim and then had sexual intercourse with the victim after she died, and where defendant argued that schizophrenia limited his capacity to form the deliberate intent required to sustain a first-degree murder conviction, evidence that defendant took conscious steps to walk through his house to retrieve a knife, address the victim in a theatrical manner saying that he had a \"present\" for her, and finally manipulate her neck before stabbing her was sufficient for a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt the essential facts required for conviction of first-degree, deliberate intent murder.State v. Martinez, 2021-NMSC-012.\n\nExclusion of expert testimony held error.— The trial court committed reversible error when it sua sponte excluded the expert testimony of defendant's sole witness, a neuropsychologist, who was prepared to testify regarding defendant's neurological deficits, which defendant contends were relevant to whether he formed the deliberate intent to kill.State v. Balderama, 2004-NMSC-008, 135 N.M. 329, 88 P.3d 845.\n\nPeriod of deliberation.— Murder in the first degree is a willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, and although a deliberate intention means an intention or decision arrived at after careful thought and after a weighing of the reasons for the commission of the killing, such a decision may be reached in a short period of time.State v. Lucero, 1975-NMSC-061, 88 N.M. 441, 541 P.2d 430.\n\nBurden of proof.— The burden is on the state to prove that a defendant not only had an opportunity to form deliberate intent but did in fact form a deliberate intent to kill.State v. Motes, 1994-NMSC-115, 118 N.M. 727, 885 P.2d 648.\n\nTransferred intent to kill.— In a homicide case where A shot at B, and the bullet struck C and killed him, the malice or intent followed the bullet.State v. Carpio, 1921-NMSC-063, 27 N.M. 265, 199 P. 1012.\n\nCharge that murder was done willfully, deliberately and premeditatedly and with malice aforethought was sustained by proof that it was committed with a mind imbued with those qualities, though they were directed against a person other than the one killed.State v. Carpio, 1921-NMSC-063, 27 N.M. 265, 199 P. 1012.\n\nTransferred intent applicable to murder and attempted murder.— The doctrine of transferred intent applies to both murder and attempted murder.State v. Gillette, 1985-NMCA-037, 102 N.M. 695, 699 P.2d 626.\n\nPeriod of time to abandon intent.— Just as it requires no period of time to form a deliberate intent to kill, so too, it does not require a certain period of time to abandon a pre-existing depraved mind. Although the initial act of defendant shooting indiscriminately at two people at two different times could have been found by the jury to be a depraved-mind action and one done with a wicked and malignant heart, these actions did not wound or kill the victim or anyone else. It is the criminal intent at the time of the commission of the crime that is determinative.State v. Hernandez, 1994-NMSC-045, 117 N.M. 497, 873 P.2d 243.\n\nQuestion of deliberation and premeditation in murder case was for juryto determine upon a consideration of all the surrounding circumstances tending to show the relation of the parties to each other and the animus of the accused toward the deceased.State v. Smith, 1966-NMSC-128, 76 N.M. 477, 416 P.2d 146.\n\nDirect or circumstantial evidence.— While deliberation and premeditation are essential elements of murder in the first degree, these, like other elements, may be shown by direct evidence or by circumstances from which their existence may be inferred by the jury.State v. Montoya, 1963-NMSC-098, 72 N.M. 178, 381 P.2d 963.\n\nThe essential elements of murder in the first degree, including the elements of deliberation and premeditation, may be shown not only by direct evidence but by circumstances from which their existence may be inferred.State v. Smith, 1966-NMSC-128, 76 N.M. 477, 416 P.2d 146.\n\nEvidence of wounds inflicted in fight was sufficientto support a finding of premeditation, intent to kill and malice.State v. Garcia, 1956-NMSC-058, 61 N.M. 291, 299 P.2d 467.\n\nStriking victim with car.— In case where the defendant struck the deceased with his automobile after an argument between the two and after deceased was seen to strike defendant's mother, the facts and surrounding circumstances warranted a finding by the jury that the killing was malicious, deliberate and premeditated.State v. Montoya, 1963-NMSC-098, 72 N.M. 178, 381 P.2d 963.\n\nForcing car off road.— From evidence that in the course of a high speed police chase defendant made a deliberate sharp turn into the police car, forcing it off the road while driving at a speed of 110 m.p.h., the jury could reasonably have inferred that defendant intended to murder the police officers.State v. Bell, 1972-NMCA-101, 84 N.M. 133, 500 P.2d 418 (affirming conviction of assault on police officers with intent to commit a violent felony).\n\nShooting deceased's fleeing wife.— Where defendant's shooting of decedent's wife occurred within a second or so after the shooting of decedent and as she sought to escape, shooting her under the circumstances had real probative value upon the issues of deliberation and intent, and constituted evidence of a preconceived plan to kill her as well as her husband.State v. Lucero, 1975-NMSC-061, 88 N.M. 441, 541 P.2d 430.\n\nPremeditation is a necessary element in proof of second degree murder.State v. White, 1956-NMSC-038, 61 N.M. 109, 295 P.2d 1019.\n\nIII. FELONY MURDER.\n\nRequirements that a felony must meet before it can be a predicate to felony murder.— There must be a causal relationship between the felony and the homicide, the felony must be independent of or collateral to the homicide, and the felony must be inherently or foreseeably dangerous to human life.State v. Groves, 2021-NMSC-003.\n\nThe felonious purpose test.— A crime's objective is its felonious purpose, and if that purpose is something other than \"to injure or kill,\" the felony may serve as a predicate felony to felony murder.State v. Groves, 2021-NMSC-003.\n\nAggravated fleeing a law enforcement officer does not violate the collateral felony rule and may serve as a predicate felony for felony murder.— The felonious purpose of the aggravated fleeing statute is to flee from law enforcement to avoid apprehension, not to endanger or harm someone. Aggravated fleeing, therefore, does not violate the collateral felony rule and may serve as a predicate felony for felony murder if the defendant acted with the requisite mens rea.State v. Groves, 2021-NMSC-003.\n\nDistrict court erred in concluding that aggravated fleeing may not serve as a predicate felony for felony murder.— Where defendants stole a van from an Albuquerque business, and rather than stopping when they realized that police were in pursuit, they fled, and where, during the pursuit through residential neighborhoods, defendants, driving at speeds of up to 78 mph in a 35 mph zone, ran a stop sign and hit another car resulting in the deaths of two people, the district court erred in concluding that aggravated fleeing a law enforcement officer may not serve as the predicate felony for a felony murder charge. Aggravated fleeing a law enforcement officer may serve as a predicate felony for felony murder because it satisfies the causal requirement, the collateral felony rule, and the requirement that the felony be inherently or foreseeably dangerous to human life.State v. Groves, 2021-NMSC-003.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where the non-conflicting testimony of witnesses established that while defendant was attending a party, defendant visited the victim's apartment several times to buy marijuana; when the supply of marijuana was exhausted, defendant gestured to a screwdriver in defendant's waistband and said that defendant was going to \"jack\" the victim; defendant went to the victim's apartment, started punching the victim and held the screwdriver against the victim's neck; when the victim reached for a gun, defendant took a gun away from the victim, put the gun to the victim's head and pulled the trigger; when the gun failed to fire, defendant pulled the trigger a second time and shot and killed the victim; defendant returned to the party with the gun in defendant's hand; and defendant was showing off the gun and stated that defendant had taken the gun from the victim and \"blasted\" the victim, the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that defendant committed the predicate offense of armed robbery and then intentionally killed the victim during the robbery.State v. Garcia, 2011-NMSC-003, 149 N.M. 185, 246 P.3d 1057.\n\nThe felony murder statute expresses a clear legislative intentthat a killing during the commission of a felony constitutes unitary conduct in every case and a conviction of both the predicate felony and felony murder violates double jeopardy.State v. Frazier, 2007-NMSC-032, 142 N.M. 120, 164 P.3d 1.\n\nWhere there is only one first degree felony convictionwhich also serves as the predicate felony for a felony murder conviction, the legislature did not intend to allow a separate conviction for that same felony.State v. Frazier, 2007-NMSC-032, 142 N.M. 120, 164 P.3d 1.\n\nIt is per se fundamental error for aggravated batteryto be used as an alternative predicate for felony murder.Campos v. Bravo, 2007-NMSC-021, 141 N.M. 801, 161 P.3d 846.\n\nNot all underlying felonies constitute an aggravating circumstance.In fact, the only underlying felonies for felony murder that can serve as an aggravating circumstance for capital sentencing are kidnapping, criminal sexual contact of a minor, and criminal sexual penetration.State v. Fry, 2006-NMSC-001, 138 N.M. 700, 126 P.3d 516.\n\nWhen state proves elements of felony murder,it has proved all of the elements of the capital felony of first degree murder.State v. Fry, 2006-NMSC-001, 138 N.M. 700, 126 P.3d 516.\n\nEligibility for death penalty.---New Mexico requires an aggravating circumstance, in addition to the commission of felony murder, in order to be eligible for the death penalty.State v. Fry, 2006-NMSC-001, 138 N.M. 700, 126 P.3d 516 (decided under prior law).\n\nLimitations to felony murder doctrine.— While the wording of this section is broad, New Mexico has created five main limitations to the felony murder doctrine.State v. O'Kelly, 2004-NMCA-013, 135 N.M. 40, 84 P.3d 88, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-001, 137 N.M. 17, 106 P.3d 578.\n\nAll of New Mexico's felony murder limitations work together to ensure that defendants convicted of felony murder have a culpable mental state consistent with the legislature's retributive and punitive goals.State v. O'Kelly, 2004-NMCA-013, 135 N.M. 40, 84 P.3d 88, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-001, 137 N.M. 17, 106 P.3d 578.\n\nAccomplices.— A defendant cannot be charged with felony murder based on the lethal acts of another person who is not an accomplice.State v. O'Kelly, 2004-NMCA-013, 135 N.M. 40, 84 P.3d 88, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-001, 137 N.M. 17, 106 P.3d 578.\n\nDefendant may not be held liable for depraved mind murder when he or his accomplice did not commit the lethal act that killed an innocent bystander.State v. O'Kelly, 2004-NMCA-013, 135 N.M. 40, 84 P.3d 88, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-001, 137 N.M. 17, 106 P.3d 578.\n\nFelony murder statute constitutional.— Constitutional objection that felony murder statute under which petitioner was convicted was so broad and vague as to be unconstitutional was rejected.Hines v. Baker, 309 F. Supp. 1017 (D.N.M. 1968),aff'd, 422 F.2d 1002 (10th Cir. 1970).\n\nPurpose.— In our felony-murder statute the legislature has permissibly determined that a killing in the commission or attempted commission of a felony is deserving of more serious punishment than other killings in which the killer's mental state might be similar but the circumstances of the killing are not as grave.State v. Ortega, 1991-NMSC-084, 112 N.M. 554, 817 P.2d 1196.\n\nIntent to kill for felony murderneed not be a \"willful, deliberate and premeditated\" intent as contemplated by the definition of first degree murder in Subsection A(1) of this section, nor need the act be \"greatly dangerous to the lives of others, indicating a depraved mind regardless of human life\", as contemplated by the definition in Subsection (A)(3).State v. Ortega, 1991-NMSC-084, 112 N.M. 554, 817 P.2d 1196.\n\nAn intent to kill in the form of knowledge that the defendant's acts \"create a strong probability of death or great bodily harm\" to the victim or another, so that the killing would be only second degree murder under Subsection B of this section if no felony were involved, is sufficient to constitute murder in the first degree when a felony is involved - or so the legislature has determined.State v. Ortega, 1991-NMSC-084, 112 N.M. 554, 817 P.2d 1196.\n\nThe \"malice\" required for murder (both first and second degree), as opposed to manslaughter, is an intent to kill or an intent to do an act greatly dangerous to the lives of others or with knowledge that the act creates a strong probability of death or great bodily harm. The same intent should be required to invest with first degree murder status a killing in the commission of or attempt to commit a first degree or other inherently dangerous felony.State v. Ortega, 1991-NMSC-084, 112 N.M. 554, 817 P.2d 1196.\n\nIn addition to proof that the defendant caused (or aided and abetted) the killing, there must be proof that the defendant intended to kill (or was knowingly heedless that death might result from his conduct). An unintentional or accidental killing will not suffice.State v. Ortega, 1991-NMSC-084, 112 N.M. 554, 817 P.2d 1196.\n\nFelony murder does have a mens rea element, which cannot be presumed simply from the commission or attempted commission of a felony.State v. Ortega, 1991-NMSC-084, 112 N.M. 554, 817 P.2d 1196.\n\nIntent requirement.— The felony-murder intent requirement is satisfied if there is proof that the defendant intended to kill, knew that his actions created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to the victim or another person, or acted in a manner greatly dangerous to the lives of others.State v. Griffin, 1993-NMSC-071, 116 N.M. 689, 866 P.2d 1156.\n\nConclusive presumption disapproved.— To presume conclusively that one who commits any felony has the requisite mens rea to commit first degree murder is a legal fiction which can no longer be supported where the felony is of lesser than first degree.State v. Harrison, 1977-NMSC-038, 90 N.M. 439, 564 P.2d 1321.\n\nMurder during commission of first degree felony.— In a felony murder case where the collateral felony is a first degree felony, the res gestae test shall be used.State v. Harrison, 1977-NMSC-038, 90 N.M. 439, 564 P.2d 1321.\n\nMurder during commission of dangerous lesser degree felony.— In a felony murder charge, involving a collateral felony, which is not of the first degree, that felony must be inherently dangerous or committed under circumstances that are inherently dangerous to support a felony murder conviction.State v. Harrison, 1977-NMSC-038, 90 N.M. 439, 564 P.2d 1321.\n\nRobbery may raise second degree murder to first.— Robbery can be the predicate offense to raise second degree murder to first degree felony murder, under Subsection A(2), where there is a causal relationship between the robbery and the murder, the robbery is independent of or collateral to the murder, and the nature of the robbery is inherently or foreseeably dangerous to human life.State v. Duffy, 1998-NMSC-014, 126 N.M. 132, 967 P.2d 807.\n\nDangerous lesser degree felony high probability of death.— Of the felonies which are not of the first degree, only those known to have a high probability of death may be utilized for a conviction of first degree murder.State v. Harrison, 1977-NMSC-038, 90 N.M. 439, 564 P.2d 1321.\n\nUnderlying felony need not be dangerous.— It is irrelevant that, in the abstract, trafficking a controlled substance by possession with intent to distribute is not necessarily a dangerous crime. The standard applied to defendant was, while engaging in that particular felony, and as a consequence of the felony, defendant intended to kill.State v. Bankert, 1994-NMSC-052, 117 N.M. 614, 875 P.2d 370.\n\nJury to determine dangerousness.— Both the nature of the felony and the circumstances of its commission may be considered to determine whether it was inherently dangerous to human life; this is for the jury to decide, subject to review by the appellate courts.State v. Harrison, 1977-NMSC-038, 90 N.M. 439, 564 P.2d 1321.\n\nIt was proper for the jury to determine whether the crime of criminal sexual contact was inherently dangerous for purposes of felony murder.State v. Mora, 1997-NMSC-060, 124 N.M. 346, 950 P.2d 789.\n\nSequence not determinative.— If a homicide occurs within the res gestae of a felony, the felony murder provision of the statute is applicable, and whether the homicide occurred before or after the actual commission of the felony is not determinative of the applicability of the felony murder provision.State v. Flowers, 1971-NMSC-091, 83 N.M. 113, 489 P.2d 178;Nelson v. Cox, 1960-NMSC-005, 66 N.M. 397, 349 P.2d 118.\n\nIntent not determinative.— Killing by person engaged in commission of a felony was first degree murder by both the principal and accessory present aiding and abetting, whether the killing was intentional or accidental.State v. Smelcer, 1924-NMSC-059, 30 N.M. 122, 228 P. 183.\n\nVoluntary intoxication no defense to first degree felony murder.— Intoxication is not a defense to second degree murder and, therefore, is also not a defense to first degree felony murder.State v. Pando, 1996-NMCA-078, 122 N.M. 167, 921 P.2d 1285.\n\nFelony murder applicable to attempts.— The felony murder provision is clearly applicable once conduct in furtherance of the commission of a felony has progressed sufficiently to constitute an attempt to commit the felony, and an attempt has been accomplished when an overt act, in furtherance of and tending to effect the commission of the felony, has been performed or undertaken with intent to commit the felony.State v. Flowers, 1971-NMSC-091, 83 N.M. 113, 489 P.2d 178.\n\nWhere the evidence clearly supported a reasonable inference that defendant had already formed the intent to take the automobile and was in the process of executing that intent when the shooting occurred and before the death of decedent, an instruction on the felony murder rule was appropriate.State v. Flowers, 1971-NMSC-091, 83 N.M. 113, 489 P.2d 178.\n\nCrime of attempted felony murder does not exist in New Mexicoand the trial court cannot have jurisdiction over such a charge. Since the trial court lacks jurisdiction, there is no basis for a claim of double jeopardy, and on remand, the prosecution may file an alternate, proper charge.State v. Price, 1986-NMCA-036, 104 N.M. 703, 726 P.2d 857, cert. quashed, 104 N.M. 702, 726 P.2d 856.\n\nPrecise felony to be named in charge.— Before defendant can be convicted of felony murder, he must be given notice of the precise felony with which he is being charged and the name of the felony underlying the charge must be either contained in the information or indictment or furnished to the defendant in sufficient time to enable him to prepare his defense.State v. Hicks, 1976-NMSC-069, 89 N.M. 568, 555 P.2d 689.\n\nAttempt subsumed under offense named.— Conviction of first degree murder under the felony murder rule for an attempt to commit a felony when the charge under the indictment alleged the completion of the felony did not infringe fundamental rights of defendant, since the attempt to commit the crime charge is a necessarily included offense.State v. Turnbow, 1960-NMSC-081, 67 N.M. 241, 354 P.2d 533.\n\nFelony murder requires absence of independent intervening force.— In a felony murder, the death must be caused by the acts of the defendant or his accomplice without an independent intervening force.State v. Adams, 1979-NMSC-032, 92 N.M. 669, 593 P.2d 1072;State v. Perrin, 1979-NMSC-050, 93 N.M. 73, 596 P.2d 516.\n\nCriminal sexual penetration as predicate felony.— Applying the strict-elements test, first degree criminal sexual penetration (CSP) is not a lesser included offense of second degree murder and, accordingly, first degree CSP could properly serve as a predicate for applying the felony-murder doctrine.State v. Campos, 1996-NMSC-043, 122 N.M. 148, 921 P.2d 1266.\n\nFalse imprisonment as predicate felony.— Based on evidence that the victim was forced into the back of a two-door car at gunpoint and was beaten with a gun as he was driven to an isolated location where he was shot, and that defendant and her accomplices were armed and had been drinking throughout the evening, a rational jury could find that defendant committed the crime of false imprisonment \"under circumstances or in a manner dangerous to human life\" as the predicate felony for felony murder.State v. Smith, 2001-NMSC-004, 130 N.M. 117, 19 P.3d 254.\n\nShooting at or from a motor vehicle may not serve as the predicate felony for felony murder.— Under the collateral felony rule, the predicate felony must be independent of or collateral to the homicide, and the predicate felony cannot be a lesser-included offense of second-degree murder. Shooting at or from a motor vehicle is an elevated form of aggravated battery, a lesser-included offense of second-degree murder, and thus cannot be used as a predicate for felony murder, so where defendant was convicted of first-degree felony murder, the underlying felony of which was shooting from a motor vehicle, defendant's felony murder conviction was vacated because the crime of shooting at or from a motor vehicle lacks an independent felonious purpose from that required under second-degree murder.State v. Marquez, 2016-NMSC-025.\n\nNew rule that shooting at or from a motor vehicle cannot be used as a predicate for felony murder applies retroactively.— InState v. Marquez, 2016-NMSC-025, the New Mexico supreme court determined that shooting at or from a motor vehicle is an elevated form of aggravated battery and thus cannot be used as a predicate for felony murder; shooting at or from a motor vehicle does not have a felonious purpose independent from the purpose of endangering the physical health of the victim because shooting from a motor vehicle must be accomplished with reckless disregard for the safety of a person.Marquezestablished a new substantive rule that narrowed the range of punishable conduct that could support a felony murder conviction, and therefore should be given retroactive effect.Rudolfo v. Steward, 2023-NMSC-013.\n\nRetroactive application of new substantive rule established inState v. Marquez.— Where petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder under a general verdict at a trial in which the jury instructions contained two alternative theories for the jury to use as a basis for the first-degree murder conviction: felony murder predicated on shooting at or from a motor vehicle and willful and deliberate murder, and where, on direct appeal, the New Mexico supreme court vacated petitioner's conviction for felony murder, holding that the crime of shooting at or from a motor vehicle may not serve as the predicate felony in support of a felony murder charge, and where, in a petition for habeas corpus, petitioner claimed that the supreme court's holding applies retroactively and that his conviction for willful and deliberate murder must also be vacated, the district court erred in denying petitioner's habeas petition, because a general verdict must be reversed if one of the alternative bases of conviction is legally inadequate, and in this case it is impossible to determine whether the general verdict was based on the legally invalid theory of felony murder or on willful and deliberate murder.Rudolfo v. Steward, 2023-NMSC-013.\n\nShooting at or from a motor vehicle cannot serve as the underlying felony sustaining a felony murder conviction.— Where defendant was convicted of first-degree felony murder predicated on the underlying felony of shooting at or from a motor vehicle, the New Mexico supreme court vacated defendant's conviction of felony murder because shooting at or from a motor vehicle is an elevated form of aggravated battery, and thus cannot be used as a predicate for felony murder.State v. Baroz, 2017-NMSC-030.\n\nShooting at dwelling as predicate felony.— Applying the strict-elements test, shooting at a dwelling is not a lesser included offense of second degree murder, and the offense could serve as a predicate for applying the felony-murder doctrine.State v. Varela, 1999-NMSC-045, 128 N.M. 454, 993 P.2d 1280.\n\nConvictions for felony murder and shooting at a dwellingviolated defendant's right to be protected from double jeopardy.State v. Varela, 1999-NMSC-045, 128 N.M. 454, 993 P.2d 1280.\n\nInsufficient evidence that defendant committed the predicate felony of shooting at a dwelling or occupied building.— Where defendant was convicted of felony murder predicated on the felony of shooting at a dwelling or occupied building, the evidence established that defendant and his companions targeted the victims in the course of a gunfight that took place in front of a dwelling, but did not shoot at or target the dwelling. Therefore, the evidence is not sufficient to support a conviction of felony murder predicated on the felony of shooting at a dwelling.State v. Comitz, 2019-NMSC-011.\n\nSentences for kidnapping and felony murder not double jeopardy.— Sentences for both kidnapping and felony murder did not violate double jeopardy since the kidnapping was sufficiently separated in time and space from the murder to establish two distinct crimes.State v. Kersey, 1995-NMSC-054, 120 N.M. 517, 903 P.2d 828.\n\nWhere the conduct underlying defendant's convictions for aggravated kidnapping and first degree felony murder was not unitary, the district court did not violate double jeopardy by convicting and sentencing defendant for both first degree felony murder and aggravated kidnapping.State v. Foster, 1999-NMSC-007, 126 N.M. 646, 974 P.2d 140.\n\nUnitary conduct in commission of murder and robbery.— Since the defendant's conduct in stabbing and robbing a cabdriver was unitary, the elements of armed robbery were subsumed by the elements of felony murder in the course of an armed robbery and conviction and sentencing of the defendant for both felony murder and the underlying felony of armed robbery violated double jeopardy.State v. Contreras, 1995-NMSC-056, 120 N.M. 486, 903 P.2d 228.\n\nConvictions for felony murder and robbery, because they arise out of unitary conduct, violate the defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy.State v. Duffy, 1998-NMSC-014, 126 N.M. 132, 967 P.2d 807.\n\nWhere armed robbery provided the underlying felony for defendant's first degree murder conviction, the elements of the former crime were subsumed within the elements of the murder offense and, therefore, reversal of defendant's conviction and sentence for armed robbery was required.State v. Foster, 1999-NMSC-007, 126 N.M. 646, 974 P.2d 140.\n\nConduct not unitary.— Convictions for both felony murder and armed robbery do not violate double jeopardy principles where the evidence supports an inference that there were two distinct uses of force.State v. Reyes, 2002-NMSC-024, 132 N.M. 576, 52 P.3d 948.\n\nEvidence of holdups inadmissible.— Evidence of two \"holdups\" perpetrated by defendant just prior to murder for which he is charged, and concerning which there is no evidence of robbery, was inadmissible.Roper v. Territory, 1893-NMSC-026, 7 N.M. 255, 33 P. 1014.\n\nNot felony murder of cofelon where killing committed by resisting victim.— A coperpetrator of a felony cannot be charged under this section with the felony murder of a cofelon when the killing is committed by the intended robbery victim while resisting the commission of the offense.Jackson v. State, 1979-NMSC-013, 92 N.M. 461, 589 P.2d 1052.\n\nDefendant was not entitled to a manslaughter instruction where there was no evidence that the victim was the source of the provocation.— Where defendant was convicted of felony murder, the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter was not improper where defendant argued at trial that the source of the provocation was his accomplice, not the victim, and it is settled law that the victim of voluntary manslaughter must be the source of the provocation. A third party, such as an accomplice, cannot properly support a provocation defense under New Mexico law, and thus there was no evidence of provocation that could reduce the charge of murder to manslaughter.State v. Sloan, 2019-NMSC-019.\n\nIV. GREATLY DANGEROUS ACTS.\n\nDepraved mind murder requires extremely reckless conductevidencing indifference for the value of human life.State v. Ibn Omar-Muhammad, 1985-NMSC-006, 102 N.M. 274, 694 P.2d 922.\n\nIndicators of a depraved mind.— The four indicators of a depraved mind are as follows: (1) more than one person was endangered by the defendant's act, (2) the defendant's act was intentional and extremely reckless, (3) the defendant had subjective knowledge that his act was greatly dangerous to the lives of others, and (4) the defendant's act encompassed an intensified malice or evil intent.State v. Candelaria, 2019-NMSC-004.\n\nIn defendant's trial for depraved mind murder, there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction where defendant fired a gun at a vehicle occupied by four people, striking and killing an eight-year-old child sitting in the backseat of the vehicle, and where the evidence presented at trial established that defendant admitted firing two shots at the vehicle and that defendant knew that there were multiple people in the vehicle, and from the evidence presented the jury could have reasonably come to the conclusion that defendant acted intentionally, that shooting at a vehicle full of people qualifies as outrageously reckless conduct with a depraved kind of wantonness or total indifference for the value of human life, that defendant's act of shooting at the vehicle was greatly dangerous to the life of more than one person, and that defendant had subjective knowledge of the risk he posed to the lives of those in the vehicle.State v. Candelaria, 2019-NMSC-004.\n\nNo such crime as attempted \"depraved mind\" murder.— The crime of attempted \"depraved mind\" murder does not exist since in order to convict for such an offense, the jury would have to find that the defendant intended to perpetrate an unintentional killing, a logical impossibility.State v. Johnson, 1985-NMCA-074, 103 N.M. 364, 707 P.2d 1174, cert. quashed, 103 N.M. 344, 707 P.2d 552.\n\nDefendant must subjectively know of risks.— The depraved mind provision of this section requires proof that the defendant had subjective knowledge of the risk involved in his actions.State v. Ibn Omar-Muhammad, 1985-NMSC-006, 102 N.M. 274, 694 P.2d 922.\n\nSubjective knowledge that acts are \"greatly dangerous to the lives of others\".— Where defendants fired at a truck they presumed was empty, killing the victim inside, subjective knowledge that their acts were greatly dangerous to the lives of others is present if those acts were very risky and, under the circumstances known to them, the defendants should have realized this very high degree of risk.State v. McCrary, 1984-NMSC-005, 100 N.M. 671, 675 P.2d 120.\n\nIntoxication may be considered.— In a prosecution for depraved mind murder, evidence of intoxication may be considered by the jury when determining the required mens rea of \"subjective knowledge,\" and failure to give the defendant's instruction on intoxication was reversible error.State v. Brown, 1996-NMSC-073, 122 N.M. 724, 931 P.2d 69.\n\nVehicular homicide by reckless conductis lesser included offense of depraved mind murder by vehicle.State v. Ibn Omar-Muhammad, 1985-NMSC-006, 102 N.M. 274, 694 P.2d 922, modified byState v. Cleve, 1999-NMSC-017, 127 N.M. 240, 980 P.2d 23.\n\nV. SECOND DEGREE MURDER.\n\nSecond degree murder statute is designedto discourage and punish the unlawful killing of people.State v. Mireles, 2004-NMCA-100, 136 N.M. 337, 98 P.3d 727, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-008, 136 N.M. 492, 100 P.3d 197.\n\nGeneral-intent crime.— As a \"knowledge crime,\" second degree murder is a general-intent crime.State v. Campos, 1996-NMSC-043, 122 N.M. 148, 921 P.2d 1266.\n\nKnowledge required of defendant.— Second degree murder requires that the defendant know that his actions create a strong probability of death or great bodily harm.State v. Mireles, 2004-NMCA-100, 136 N.M. 337, 98 P.3d 727, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-008, 136 N.M. 492, 100 P.3d 197.\n\nThe district court erred in modifying the mens rea element in the uniform jury instruction for second-degree murder.— In defendant's trial for second-degree murder, where defendant claimed that he did not know that his shotgun was loaded prior to shooting and killing his friend, the district court erred in accepting the state's modified jury instruction which changed the mens rea element for second-degree murder to \"knew or should have known\" that defendant's acts created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to the victim, because adding \"should have known\" to the mens rea element was a misstatement of law, and when a jury instruction directs the jury to find guilt based upon a misstatement of the law, a finding of juror misdirection is unavoidable. The second-degree murder statute's plain language and New Mexico's uniform jury instructions on second-degree murder require that the defendant possess knowledge of the probable consequences of his or her acts.State v. Suazo, 2017-NMSC-011.\n\nSufficient evidence supports retrial after reversal of second-degree murder conviction.— Where defendant's conviction for second-degree murder was reversed on appeal, there was sufficient evidence to support a retrial where it was undisputed that defendant killed his friend with a shotgun and there was sufficient evidence to support a reasonable jury's conclusion that, based on ambiguous evidence regarding who loaded the gun and when it was loaded, and the steps defendant took after the crime to conceal evidence, that defendant knew the gun was loaded and knew that pulling the trigger would cause great bodily harm or death to the victim, and that there was not enough evidence to constitute sufficient provocation to reduce the crime to manslaughter.State v. Suazo, 2017-NMSC-011.\n\nElement of deliberation excluded.— The legislature intended to exclude from second degree murder the element of deliberation but not to exclude otherwise intentional killings from that crime; under New Mexico's statutory scheme, murder consists of two categories of intentional killings: those that are willful, deliberate, and premeditated; and those that are committed without such deliberation and premeditation but with knowledge that the killer's acts create a strong probability of death or great bodily harm.State v. Garcia, 1992-NMSC-048, 114 N.M. 269, 837 P.2d 862.\n\nIncludes intentional murder.— Fact that 1980 amendments require only the elements of a killing in the performance of an act which the defendant knows creates the requisite probability does not mean that second degree murder excludes intentional murders.State v. Johnson, 1985-NMCA-074, 103 N.M. 364, 707 P.2d 1174, cert. quashed, 103 N.M. 344, 707 P.2d 552.\n\nMens rea with respect to actual victim not necessary.— To be guilty of second degree murder, it is sufficient that the defendant have the necessary mens rea with respect to the individual toward whom the defendant's lethal act was directed; it is not necessary, however, that the defendant have this mens rea with respect to the actual victim of that act.State v. Lopez, 1996-NMSC-036, 122 N.M. 63, 920 P.2d 1017.\n\nSecond degree murder, assisted suicide, not same offense.— The second degree murder statute (Subsection B) is aimed at preventing an individual from actively causing the death of someone contemplating suicide, whereas the assisting suicide statute (Section 30-2-4 NMSA 1978) is aimed at preventing an individual from providing someone contemplating suicide with the means to commit suicide. Thus, the two statutes do not condemn the same offense.State v. Sexson, 1994-NMCA-004, 117 N.M. 113, 869 P.2d 301, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 215, 870 P.2d 753.\n\nSuicide pact not exemption from conviction for murder.— The existence of a suicide pact does not exempt someone from a conviction for committing murder. However, that general rule may not apply if the means of attempted suicide used presents the same risk to both of the parties at the same time, such as when a couple drive off a cliff together. Such is not the case when the victim is killed by a rifle, the trigger of which is pulled by the defendant.State v. Sexson, 1994-NMCA-004, 117 N.M. 113, 869 P.2d 301, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 215, 870 P.2d 753.\n\nThere was enough evidence to support a conviction of second degree murder because there was sufficient evidence to show that the defendant actively participated in a suicide by holding the gun to the victim's head and pulling the trigger.State v. Sexson, 1994-NMCA-004, 117 N.M. 113, 869 P.2d 301, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 215, 870 P.2d 753.\n\nCause of death.— Evidence that defendant orchestrated the beating of the victim, that he used both his fists and a baseball bat to hit the victim, that the victim's condition worsened shortly thereafter, and that the victim died, permitted the jury to make a reasonable inference that the acts of the defendant constituted a significant cause of the victim's death and that there was no other independent event that broke the chain of events from the beating to the victim's death.State v. Huber, 2006-NMCA-087, 140 N.M. 147, 140 P.3d 1096, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-007, 140 N.M. 279, 142 P.3d 360.\n\nSufficient evidence of second degree murder.— Where defendant lived with the victim for approximately one and a half months before the victim disappeared; a few weeks later, the victim's decomposed body was discovered wrapped in a blue air mattress and sheets, and covered with a mattress in an alley approximately 500 feet from defendant's apartment; defendant's parent testified that the parent sent a blue air mattress and a set of sheets to defendant; grid marks on the air mattress resembled the grid marks of a shopping cart; there was a shopping cart at the scene; shopping carts were found in defendant's apartment; DNA found on a pair of jeans near the body provided a possible link between the body and defendant; and the victims' blood was found on the carpet in defendant's apartment, the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find defendant guilty of second degree murder.State v. Schwartz, 2014-NMCA-066, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-006.\n\nSufficient evidence of second degree murder.— In defendant's murder trial, where the evidence showed that defendant was in the passenger seat of a truck that drove by the victim's residence, that a witness observed the \"muzzle flash\" from shots fired from the passenger side window of the truck in which defendant was the passenger, that the shots fired resulted in the victim's death, and where defendant admitted at trial that he knew that shooting in the direction of a group of people in a residential area presented a danger to human life, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant killed the victim and knew that his acts created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to the victim or any other human being; the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction of second-degree murder.State v. Baroz, 2017-NMSC-030.\n\nThere was probable cause to charge second-degree murder where the evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable belief that defendant committed the crime.— Where defendant was charged with second-degree murder and the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter, and where the district court judge found that there was no probable cause to bind defendant over for trial on second-degree murder and entered an order binding defendant over for trial on voluntary manslaughter alone, the district court erred in failing to find probable cause where the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing showed that defendant pointed a gun at the victim based on little provocation other than an argument about the charge for cleaning up the vomit in the back seat of defendant's car, that defendant opened his car door to reprimand the victim for slamming the door, got out of his car to pull out his gun, and pointed it at the unarmed victim, who was walking around the car from the rear passenger's side door at the time, that defendant failed to drive away from the victim when defendant had the opportunity to do so, and that although the victim threatened to run defendant over with defendant's own car, defendant, without a verbal warning, opened fire before the victim stepped into the vehicle and before the victim assumed control over the vehicle The undisputed evidence supports a reasonable belief that an ordinary person of average disposition in defendant's position would not have been provoked to the point of utilizing lethal force, but would instead have taken available opportunities to attain a position of safety from an unarmed man in no immediate position to pose a threat to defendant's safety.State v. Benedict, 2022-NMCA-030, cert. granted.\n\nVI. MANSLAUGHTER.\n\nDistinction between murder and manslaughter.— To reduce the killing from murder to voluntary manslaughter all that is required is sufficient provocation to excite in the mind of the defendant such emotions as either anger, rage, sudden resentment or terror as may be sufficient to obscure the reason of an ordinary man, and to prevent deliberation and premeditation, and to exclude malice, and to render the defendant incapable of cool reflection.State v. Harrison, 1970-NMCA-071, 81 N.M. 623, 471 P.2d 193, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 668, 472 P.2d 382.\n\nManslaughter is included in charge of murder.State v. Rose, 1968-NMSC-091, 79 N.M. 277, 442 P.2d 589, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1028, 89 S. Ct. 626, 21 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1969);State v. Lopez, 1942-NMSC-064, 46 N.M. 463, 131 P.2d 273;State v. La Boon, 1960-NMSC-118, 67 N.M. 466, 357 P.2d 54.\n\nUnder appropriate circumstances, where there is evidence that the defendant acted as a result of sufficient provocation, a charge of manslaughter could properly be said to be included in a charge of murder, and, accordingly, it would not be error to submit N.M.U.J.I. Crim. 2.20 (now seeUJI 14-220) to the jury; however, it cannot seriously be maintained that manslaughter is invariably \"necessarily included\" in murder, since different kinds of proof are required to establish the distinct offenses.Smith v. State, 1976-NMSC-085, 89 N.M. 770, 558 P.2d 39.\n\nOne indicted of murder could be found guilty of manslaughter,provided there was sufficient evidence on that issue.United States v. Densmore, 1904-NMSC-004, 12 N.M. 99, 75 P. 31.\n\nEffect of unsupported manslaughter conviction.— It is error for the court to submit to the jury an issue of whether defendant was guilty of voluntary manslaughter when the facts establish either first or second degree murder, but could not support a conviction of voluntary manslaughter and, accordingly, upon acquittal of murder and conviction of voluntary manslaughter, a reversal and discharge of the accused is required.Smith v. State, 1976-NMSC-085, 89 N.M. 770, 558 P.2d 39.\n\nInstruction not appropriate.— In prosecution for first degree murder, where the uncontradicted evidence was that defendant killed her husband with two and possibly three well placed shots into his person, which shots were fired at close range while the victim was lying down on the couch and while defendant stood over him, immediately after a discussion about the victim leaving the defendant, and that the shots came from a pistol purchased by appellant earlier the day of the homicide, no foundation existed for instruction on involuntary manslaughter.State v. Gardner, 1973-NMSC-034, 85 N.M. 104, 509 P.2d 871, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 851, 94 S. Ct. 145, 38 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1973).\n\nVoluntary manslaughter instruction refused where no provocation.— Defendant could not create the provocation which would reduce murder to manslaughter, and his requested instruction on attempted voluntary manslaughter was therefore properly refused.State v. Durante, 1986-NMCA-024, 104 N.M. 639, 725 P.2d 839.\n\nDefendant in first degree murder prosecution was not entitled to voluntary manslaughter instruction where there was no evidence of provocation on the part of victim.State v. Brown, 1998-NMSC-037, 126 N.M. 338, 969 P.2d 313.\n\nUse of too great force as manslaughter.— Defendant's choice of deadly force when confronted with a possible battery of less than deadly force would sustain a conviction of voluntary manslaughter, but not for murder.State v. McLam, 1970-NMCA-129, 82 N.M. 242, 478 P.2d 570.\n\nVII. DEFENSES.\n\nGeneral rule as to insanity.— The rule of law applicable to the defense of insanity in criminal cases is that, at the time of committing the act, the accused, as a result of disease of the mind, (a) did not know the nature and quality of the act or (b) did not know that it was wrong or (c) was incapable of preventing himself from committing it.State v. White, 1954-NMSC-050, 58 N.M. 324, 270 P.2d 727.\n\nThe state met its burden of showing that defendant was sane when he murdered the victim.— Where defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and third-degree criminal sexual penetration (CSP), based on defendant's admission that he killed the victim and then had sexual intercourse with the victim after she died, and where defendant argued that the state failed to present sufficient evidence that he was sane at the time the crimes were committed, but where the state presented expert testimony that although defendant suffered from schizophrenia, he could have prevented himself from committing the crimes, the state met its burden by presenting evidence sufficient for a reasonable juror to find that defendant could have stopped himself from killing the victim, despite defendant's schizophrenia diagnosis.State v. Martinez, 2021-NMSC-012.\n\nProof of derangement short of insanity.— In a murder trial, proof of mental derangement short of insanity is admissible, as evidence of lack of deliberation or premeditated design; this contemplates full responsibility, but only for the crime actually committed.State v. Padilla, 1959-NMSC-100, 66 N.M. 289, 347 P.2d 312.\n\nReduction of charge to second degree murder.— The court should have instructed the jury that they might consider mental defects and mental condition in ascertaining whether or not defendant had the power to deliberate the acts charged, so as to reduce the charge from first degree murder to second degree murder.State v. Padilla, 1959-NMSC-100, 66 N.M. 289, 347 P.2d 312.\n\nNo reduction of charge to manslaughter.— While a disease or defect of the mind may render an accused incapable of cool deliberation and premeditation and may be sufficient to reduce the charge against him from first to second degree murder, it does not follow that such mental condition may reduce the charge to voluntary manslaughter.State v. Chambers, 1972-NMSC-069, 84 N.M. 309, 502 P.2d 999.\n\nUse of expert evidence on incapacity.— Nothing compels the trier of the facts to disregard the nonexpert testimony and to accept the opinions of defendant's medical experts as to his probable state of mind and incapacity to control his will at the time of committing a criminal act. The jury is not required to accept these expert opinions and disregard all other evidence bearing on the question of his mental and emotional state, nor is the trial court bound to accept these expert opinions and dismiss the charges of first and second degree murder.State v. Smith, 1969-NMCA-016, 80 N.M. 126, 452 P.2d 195.\n\nVoluntary intoxication is no defense to murder in second degree.State v. Gray, 1969-NMCA-102, 80 N.M. 751, 461 P.2d 233;State v. Williams, 1966-NMSC-145, 76 N.M. 578, 417 P.2d 62.\n\nIn this state, no specific intent to kill is required for a conviction for second degree murder; hence, voluntary intoxication is no defense to such a charge.State v. Tapia, 1970-NMSC-004, 81 N.M. 274, 466 P.2d 551.\n\nIntoxication may reduce depraved mind murder.— Evidence of intoxication may be considered to reduce first degree depraved mind murder to second degree murder, but it may not be used to reduce second degree murder to voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter, or to completely excuse the defendant from the consequences of his unlawful act.State v. Brown, 1996-NMSC-073, 122 N.M. 724, 931 P.2d 69.\n\nJury to determine effect of intoxication.— In a homicide case the defendant is entitled to have the jury determine the degree and effect of his intoxication upon his mental capacity and deliberative powers; however, the evidence as to intoxication must be substantial and must relate to defendant's condition as of the time of the commission of the homicide, or be so closely related in time that it can reasonably be inferred that the condition continued to the time of the commission of the homicide.State v. Williams, 1966-NMSC-145, 76 N.M. 578, 417 P.2d 62.\n\nLack of justification not element of homicide.— Every killing of a person by another is presumed to be unlawful, and only when it can be shown to be excusable or justifiable will it be held otherwise; when the evidence permits, excuse of justification may be raised as a defense and decided by the fact finder, but initially, the absence of excuse or justification is not an element of homicide to be proven by the prosecution.State v. Noble, 1977-NMSC-031, 90 N.M. 360, 563 P.2d 1153.\n\nDefendant to raise reasonable doubt.— Defendant, of course, did not have the burden of proving that he killed in self-defense. All he was required to do was produce evidence which would raise a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors.State v. Harrison, 1970-NMCA-071, 81 N.M. 623, 471 P.2d 193, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 668, 472 P.2d 382.\n\nIssue of self-defense for jury.— The line of demarcation between a homicide which amounts to voluntary manslaughter and one which amounts to justifiable homicide in self-defense is not always clearly defined and depends upon the facts of each case as it arises. Those facts are for the jury, under instructions from the court, laying down the principles of law governing the same, as was done in this case.State v. Harrison, 1970-NMCA-071, 81 N.M. 623, 471 P.2d 193, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 668, 472 P.2d 382.\n\nDefendant not entitled to self-defense instruction.— In defendant's murder trial, where the evidence demonstrated that defendant provoked the situation when defendant and his father drove to the victim's residence and shouted \"southside,\" and where the victim and others in the yard of the residence approached the truck in which defendant was the passenger, it was not reasonable for defendant to have used deadly force, and because defendant voluntarily entered into the situation, he cannot avail himself of the law of self-defense; the district court did not err in rejecting defendant's self-defense instruction.State v. Baroz, 2017-NMSC-030.\n\nInstruction improper.— Defendant in homicide prosecution claiming self-defense was not entitled to instruction on justifiable homicide under belief that deceased was about to have carnal intercourse with defendant's wife.State v. Greenlee, 1928-NMSC-020, 33 N.M. 449, 269 P. 331.\n\nJustifiable killing.— Where defendant was violently assaulted by deceased, and then defendant drew his pistol and fired two shots at deceased which killed him instantly, such killing was not cruel and unusual within statutes defining murder, since the killing was justifiable.Territory v. Fewel, 1888-NMSC-018, 5 N.M. 34, 17 P. 569.\n\nDefense of chastity.— In murder prosecution, the refusal of an instruction that the defense of one's person included, in the case of a woman, the protection of her chastity and that if, under the circumstances, she had reason to believe that the attack would lead to the sexual abuse of her person, she would be justified in using such force as was necessary, even to the extent of taking the life of her assailant, to protect her honor and chastity and her body from sexual abuse, was erroneous where the defense was that accused killed decedent to protect herself from an attempted rape.State v. Martinez, 1924-NMSC-075, 30 N.M. 178, 230 P. 379.\n\nDefense of habitation.— Where defense of habitation was invoked in homicide case, the danger or apparent danger was to be considered from standpoint of prisoner at time shot was fired, and not according to facts as they developed at trial.State v. Couch, 1946-NMSC-047, 52 N.M. 127, 193 P.2d 405.\n\nInstruction that injury to dwelling to be felonious so as to justify killing must be of a substantial character constituted prejudicial error.State v. Couch, 1946-NMSC-047, 52 N.M. 127, 193 P.2d 405.\n\nDefendant's use of force in response to lawful defense of habitation was not objectively reasonable and therefore he was not entitled to a self-defense instruction.— In defendant's trial for first-degree murder, the district court did not err in denying defendant's requested jury instruction on self-defense where the uncontested evidence demonstrated that defendant's provocative acts constituted a basis for the householder and her guest to reasonably believe that defendant intended to commit a violent felony upon one or more of the dwellers in the habitation, and because the householder or her guest were entitled to use deadly force under such circumstances, defendant's responsive use of deadly force in firing a gunshot into the residence was not an objectively reasonable act of self-defense.State v. Galindo, 2024-NMSC-004.\n\nKilling in prevention of crime.— A well-founded belief that a known felony was about to be committed will extenuate a homicide committed in prevention of the supposed crime, and this upon a principle of necessity; but when the necessity ceases, and the supposed felon flees, and thereby abandons his proposed design, a killing in pursuit, however well-grounded the belief may be that he intended to commit a felony, will not extenuate the offense of the pursuer.Brown v. Martinez, 1961-NMSC-040, 68 N.M. 271, 361 P.2d 152.\n\nMurder while resisting arrest.— Killing of person making authorized arrest is murder but where the arrest is illegal, the offense is reduced to manslaughter, unless the proof shows express malice toward the deceased. If the outrage of an attempted illegal arrest has not excited the passions, a killing will be murder.Territory v. Lynch, 1913-NMSC-038, 18 N.M. 15, 133 P. 405,overruled byState v. Chamberlain, 1991-NMSC-094, 112 N.M. 723, 819 P.2d 673.\n\nInstruction not proper in absence of awareness of arrest.— Where defendant in homicide case was unaware that an attempt to arrest him was to be made, his action in killing the officer was to be viewed as in any other case, and instruction as to illegality of arrest reducing the offense to manslaughter was properly refused.State v. Middleton, 1920-NMSC-066, 26 N.M. 353, 192 P. 483.\n\nMurder while resisting search.— Homicide committed in resisting deputy sheriff who was searching defendant's house without a warrant was first degree murder if such resistance constituted a felony, as when the deputy had been engaged in serving any process, rule or order of court, or judicial writ, and instruction leaving jury to determine degree of murder was erroneous.State v. Welch, 1933-NMSC-084, 37 N.M. 549, 25 P.2d 211.\n\nVIII. INDICTMENT AND INFORMATION.\n\nOpen charge of murder sufficient notice.— A charge of murder in violation of statutes pertaining to first and second degree murder and voluntary and involuntary manslaughter is not a charge of mutually exclusive crimes, nor is it a charge of distinct and separate offenses; rather, the charge is an open charge of murder, a form of charging approved, under which the jury is to be instructed on the degrees of the unlawful killing for which there is evidence, and it gave defendant notice that he must defend against a charge of unlawfully taking a human life.State v. King, 1977-NMCA-042, 90 N.M. 377, 563 P.2d 1170,overruled on other grounds byState v. Reynolds, 1982-NMSC-091, 98 N.M. 527, 650 P.2d 811.\n\nAllegation of murderous intent not required.— Murder indictment may omit direct charge of purpose or intent to kill, as part of overt act alleged as a crime.Territory v. Montoya, 1912-NMSC-015, 17 N.M. 122, 125 P. 622.\n\nTransferred intent need not be charged.— Where the defendant, indicted on an \"open\" charge of murder, contends that since he was not charged under the specific transferred intent subsection that the instruction on that theory was improper, the defendant misapprehends the nature of this theory. Transferred intent is merely the doctrine that allows the elements of malice or intent to be demonstrated when an \"innocent\" nonoriginal victim is killed, and therefore, it is not necessary to charge the defendant with transferred intent because the indictment specifically informed the defendant of the crime and what he must be prepared to meet.State v. Hamilton, 1976-NMSC-082, 89 N.M. 746, 557 P.2d 1095.\n\nAggravating circumstances not alleged.— Death penalty proceedings are not precluded where the indictment does not allege the existence of aggravating circumstances. Since aggravating circumstances are not elements of the crime of murder, an indictment is not deficient for failure to allege them.State v. Morton, 1988-NMCA-063, 107 N.M. 478, 760 P.2d 170 (decided under prior law).\n\nCharge sufficiently specific.— The charge, \"by shooting him with a gun,\" gave defendant sufficient particulars of the offense alleged to enable the defendant to prepare a defense.State v. Smith, 1966-NMSC-128, 76 N.M. 477, 416 P.2d 146.\n\nAdequate charge on cause of victim's death.— An indictment for first degree murder, in other respects sufficient, which concluded in the following language, \"did strike and beat the said Juan Trujillo, giving to him, the said Juan Trujillo, in and upon the top of the head of him the said Juan Trujillo, one mortal contusion bruise, fracture and wound, of which said mortal wound, the said Juan Trujillo thence continually languished until . . . he there died\" charged that deceased died of the mortal wound alleged to have been inflicted by defendant.Territory v. Lobato, 1913-NMSC-030, 17 N.M. 666, 134 P. 222,aff'd, 242 U.S. 199, 37 S. Ct. 107, 61 L. Ed. 244 (1916).\n\nDistrict attorney may obtain indictment for first degree murder following second degree indictment.— Where a defendant is originally indicted for second degree murder, but later the district attorney reviews the case and decides the evidence supports first degree murder, he may seek and obtain a second indictment, this time for first degree murder.State v. Sena, 1983-NMSC-005, 99 N.M. 272, 657 P.2d 128.\n\nMay not charge first degree murder in information based on second degree bind-over.— A prosecutor is not authorized to charge first degree murder in an information based on a magistrate's bind-over order for trial on second degree murder.State v. McCrary, 1982-NMCA-003, 97 N.M. 306, 639 P.2d 593.\n\nIndictment charging first degree murder would support second degree murder conviction.Territory v. McGinnis, 1900-NMSC-019, 10 N.M. 269, 61 P. 208,overruled on other grounds byState v. Deltenre, 1966-NMSC-187, 77 N.M. 497, 424 P.2d 782, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 976, 87 S. Ct. 1171, 18 L. Ed. 2d 136 (1967).\n\nWaiver of indictment not constitutionally required.— Defendant's rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution were not violated when his murder prosecution was based upon an information filed by the district attorney, despite the fact that he never waived his right to be tried by indictment.State v. Vaughn, 1971-NMSC-015, 82 N.M. 310, 481 P.2d 98, cert. denied, 403 U.S. 933, 91 S. Ct. 2262, 29 L. Ed. 2d 712 (1971).\n\nInformation charging murder sufficient.— Information charging that defendant did \"murder\" a named person was sufficient apprisal of offense charged.State v. Roy, 1936-NMSC-048, 40 N.M. 397, 60 P.2d 646.\n\nInformation permits submission of felony murder.— Under an information charging murder in the ordinary form, it was not improper to permit introduction of proof that murder was committed in perpetrating a felony.State v. Smith, 1947-NMSC-035, 51 N.M. 184, 181 P.2d 800.\n\nInformation permits voluntary manslaughter.— Although information charged only first degree murder, submission of voluntary manslaughter was not error.State v. Burrus, 1934-NMSC-036, 38 N.M. 462, 35 P.2d 285.\n\nAppropriate crime charged.— The offense of murder and the offense of child abuse resulting in the child's death are not the same, nor is the same proof required for the two offenses, since generally speaking, murder requires an intent, whereas child abuse does not require an intent, and therefore, the indictment properly charged defendant with first degree murder.State v. Gutierrez, 1975-NMCA-121, 88 N.M. 448, 541 P.2d 628.\n\nIX. EVIDENCE AND PROOF.\n\nConsistency in the verdict is not necessary.— An alleged inconsistency between a convicted offense and acquitted offenses does not require reversal because it is equally possible that the jury, convinced of guilt, properly reached its conclusion on the compound offense, and then through mistake, compromise, or lenity, arrived at an inconsistent conclusion on the lesser offense. A criminal defendant is sufficiently protected against jury irrationality or error by the independent review of the sufficiency of the evidence as to those counts upon which a defendant is convicted.State v. Veleta, 2023-NMSC-024.\n\nAlleged inconsistency in conviction of first-degree murder and acquittal of second-degree murder did not require reversal.— Where defendant was charged with numerous crimes in connection with a dispute over missing drugs during which the victim was shot and killed, and where, at the conclusion of the trial, the jury entered verdict forms convicting defendant of willful and deliberate first-degree murder, felony murder in the first-degree, kidnapping, conspiracy, and tampering with evidence, and also entered verdict forms acquitting defendant of second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter, and where defendant argued that reversal was warranted because the guilty verdict for first-degree murder was legally inconsistent with his acquittals for second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter, reversal was not warranted, because when the evidence is sufficient to support the verdict of conviction, an appellate court will not speculate as to why the jury acquitted a defendant of other charges, even if the conviction and acquittal are allegedly inconsistent, and in this case, it was undisputed, and the record reflects, that the state presented sufficient evidence to support the conviction of willful and deliberate first-degree murder.State v. Veleta, 2023-NMSC-024.\n\nEvidence sufficient for conviction.— Where defendant testified that the victim pounded on the door of defendant's house, that the victim stated that the victim would spray defendant's house with bullets, and that as the victim started to drive away, the victim leaned over in a way that made defendant believe that the victim was reaching for a gun; defendant then shot and killed the victim; and there was evidence that the victim had been shot in the back, there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to determine that defendant was not acting in self-defense or as a result of legally sufficient provocation and to support defendant's conviction of second degree murder.State v. Herrera, 2014-NMCA-007, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nSufficient evidence to prove first-degree murder.— Where defendant was charged with first-degree murder, aggravated burglary, unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, larceny of a firearm, and theft of a credit card, and where the state presented evidence that defendant possessed a rifle of the same caliber used to kill the victim, that he threatened someone with the rifle on the same day of the murder and just across the street from the victim's home, that DNA was present on a water bottle found in the victim's home, that, after the murder, defendant drove the victim's truck, that he attempted to sell the victim's jewelry, that he carried a pistol matching the description of the victim's stolen gun, that he recruited accomplices to use the victim's stolen credit cards and checks to commit additional crimes, that he admitted to multiple people that he shot a woman after he broke into her home, and that he instructed his girlfriend where to find more of the victim's stolen property, there was sufficient evidence that a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the murder.State v. Stallings, 2020-NMSC-019.\n\nAggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances.— Standard of proof in the weighting process that the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances is neither constitutionally nor statutorily required.State v. Fry, 2006-NMSC-001, 138 N.M. 700, 126 P.3d 516.\n\nAdmission of unavailable accomplice's tape recorded custodial police interviewwas not harmless error because it provided key evidence directly inculpating defendant convicted of felony murder, and remaining circumstantial evidence against him, although strong, was disputed.State v. Johnson, 2004-NMSC-029, 136 N.M. 348, 98 P.3d 998.\n\nDefendant entitled to details.— A defendant in a murder case is entitled to know the exact date and the approximate time of day, the exact place where the body was found, and a description and identification details of the means or weapon used.State v. Mosley, 1965-NMSC-081, 75 N.M. 348, 404 P.2d 304.\n\nAdmissibility of evidence in discretion of court.— The admissibility of evidence is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.State v. Armstrong, 1956-NMSC-053, 61 N.M. 258, 298 P.2d 941.\n\nCorpus delicti rule.— A defendant's extrajudicial statements may be used to establish the corpus delicti when the prosecution is able to demonstrate the trustworthiness of the confession and introduce some independent evidence of a criminal act.State v. Wilson, 2011-NMSC-001, 149 N.M. 273, 248 P.3d 315.\n\nProof of corpus delicti.— Where defendant was charged with first degree abuse of a child resulting in death; the child died without any physical signs of trauma; defendant confessed to suffocating the child with a blanket; the evidence confirmed the statements made by defendant in the confession; the evidence also showed that the child was in normal respiratory and cardiovascular health on the day prior to the child's death, the child had not been breathing before the child was taken to an emergency room even though there was no underlying medical condition that would kill the child, defendant made false statements to police and medical personnel about the child's medical record suggesting that defendant portrayed the child as chronically sick to cover up a crime, and the cause of death was consistent with a blockage to the mouth and nose, the corpus delicti of the crime was established because the evidence corroborated the trustworthiness of defendant's confession and independently showed that the child died from a criminal act.State v. Wilson, 2011-NMSC-001, 149 N.M. 273, 248 P.3d 315.\n\nTo prove the corpus delicti in a homicide case, the state must show that the person whose death is alleged is in fact dead and that his death was criminally caused.State v. Coulter, 1973-NMCA-019, 84 N.M. 647, 506 P.2d 804.\n\nIn homicide cases the corpus delicti is established upon proof of the death of the person charged in the information or indictment, and that the death was caused by the criminal act or agency of another.State v. Armstrong, 1956-NMSC-053, 61 N.M. 258, 298 P.2d 941.\n\nIn homicide cases, if it was shown that person whose death was alleged in indictment was in fact dead, and that his death was criminally caused, the corpus delicti was sufficiently proven; circumstantial evidence would be sufficient, and eyewitness testimony was unnecessary.State v. Chaves, 1921-NMSC-105, 27 N.M. 504, 202 P. 694.\n\nProof adequate.— Where it is obvious from the evidence that deceased died as a result of wounds inflicted by someone with some sharp object at the time in question, the corpus delicti has been adequately proven.State v. Casaus, 1963-NMSC-194, 73 N.M. 152, 386 P.2d 246.\n\nEffect of lack of proof of corpus delicti.— Where there was no substantial evidence of corpus delicti in homicide case, verdict finding defendant guilty of second degree murder would be set aside on appeal.State v. Woodman, 1920-NMSC-028, 26 N.M. 55, 188 P. 1101.\n\n\"Substantial evidence\" of cause of death.— Where the pathologist testified that death \". . . was the direct result of complications from the bullet wounds, the complications being infection . . .,\" and that the cause of death was gunshot wounds, this is \"substantial evidence\" as that term has been defined in New Mexico decisions.State v. Ewing, 1968-NMCA-071, 79 N.M. 489, 444 P.2d 1000.\n\nSufficient evidence that defendant was the shooter in attempted murder case.— Where defendant was convicted of two counts of attempted first degree murder with a firearm and two counts of shooting at or from a motor vehicle, and where defendant claimed that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove that he was the shooter, there was sufficient evidence presented to allow the jury to conclude that defendant was the shooter based on testimony from the male victim that he and defendant had been in an altercation a week before the shooting, that during this altercation, defendant stated that he was going to kill the victim, that on the night of the shooting, the male victim and the female victim both observed defendant driving towards them in a brown Oldsmobile Cutlass, that the two victims recognized the Oldsmobile Cutlass as defendant's vehicle that they had seen him drive many times over the course of the thirteen years knowing him, that the female victim had previously seen defendant with a 9 mm firearm, testimony from another witness that on the night of the shooting, defendant showed up at her residence unannounced shortly after 10:00 p.m., and that defendant told her that he had shot at two people, and testimony from officers that 9 mm shell casings were found in defendant's vehicle as well as on street where the shooting occurred, and that forensic examinations determined that all the casings were fired from the same firearm.State v. Bryant, 2023-NMCA-016, cert. denied.\n\nEffect of medical treatment of victim on cause of death.— Surgical operation undertaken to save one from the probable fatal effect of a wound did not preclude homicide conviction unless it clearly appeared that maltreatment of the wound, and not the wound itself, was the sole cause of the death.Territory v. Yee Dan, 1894-NMSC-004, 7 N.M. 439, 37 P. 1101.\n\nUse of circumstantial evidence.— Circumstantial evidence is sufficient to establish guilt in a prosecution for homicide; those circumstances must point unerringly to the defendant and be incompatible with and exclude every reasonable hypothesis other than guilt.State v. Coulter, 1973-NMCA-019, 84 N.M. 647, 506 P.2d 804.\n\nThreats made by accused admissible.— Threats made by accused to kill some person not definitely designated were admissible with other explanatory matter on issue of corpus delicti especially when made shortly before commission of crime.State v. Martinez, 1919-NMSC-022, 25 N.M. 328, 182 P. 868.\n\nEvidence of motive.— Evidence of facts which could not operate on mind of defendant were inadmissible to show motive.State v. Allen, 1920-NMSC-015, 25 N.M. 682, 187 P. 559.\n\nDeceased's reputation and disposition.— Trial court in second degree murder prosecution properly excluded proffered testimony which defense wanted to use to corroborate the testimony of other witnesses which showed the deceased's reputation and disposition for fighting, his violent temper and his conduct as a bully.State v. Snow, 1972-NMCA-138, 84 N.M. 399, 503 P.2d 1177, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 390, 503 P.2d 1168.\n\nEscape evidence admitted to show depraved mind.— District court did not abuse its discretion in determining that evidence of defendant's unauthorized departure from a Colorado juvenile detention facility was admissible at his trial for murder, where the court properly could have concluded that defendant's reasons for eluding the police were circumstantial evidence relevant to the jury's determination of whether his acts indicated a depraved mind regardless of human life and whether he had a subjective knowledge of the risk involved in his actions.State v. Omar-Muhammad, 1987-NMSC-043, 105 N.M. 788, 737 P.2d 1165.\n\nPolygraph test results.— Polygraph test results may be admitted when qualifications of the polygraph operator establish his expertise, there is testimony to establish the reliability of the testing procedure employed as approved by the authorities in the field and there is evidence to show the validity of the tests made on the particular subject. However, requirements that polygraph tests be stipulated to by both parties and that no objection be made at trial to their introduction are mechanistic, inconsistent with due process and repugnant to the New Mexico rules of evidence.State v. Dorsey, 1975-NMSC-040, 88 N.M. 184, 539 P.2d 204 (affirming court of appeals, which had ruled polygraph results offered by defendant admissible to show intent and provocation);aff'g, 1975-NMCA-022, 87 N.M. 323, 532 P.2d 912.\n\nPhotographs of body.— Question of inflammation and possible prejudice, created by admission into evidence of photographs of body of alleged victim in murder trial, is left to the discretion of the trial judge absent a showing of abuse of that discretion.State v. Gardner, 1973-NMSC-034, 85 N.M. 104, 509 P.2d 871, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 851, 94 S. Ct. 145, 38 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1973).\n\nThe admission into evidence in a murder trial of photographs of the decedent taken during her autopsy is proper if they are reasonably relevant to material issues in the trial, showing the identity of the victim, and the number and location of the wounds inflicted upon her body.State v. Ho'o, 1982-NMCA-158, 99 N.M. 140, 654 P.2d 1040, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 148 655 P.2d 160.\n\nPhotographs of the body of the victim were relevant to the issues of the case in that they were used by the doctors to describe the injuries and condition of the body, and served to clarify and illustrate the testimony of witnesses and to corroborate other evidence. The admission of photographs into evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and absent a showing of an abuse the trial court's discretion will not be disturbed.State v. Coulter, 1973-NMCA-019, 84 N.M. 647, 506 P.2d 804.\n\nAdmission of hearsay constitutionally impermissible under circumstances.— Admission of extra-judicial statements attributed to children of murder victim was reversible error where the children were not called as witnesses, because defendant was thereby denied his constitutional right of confrontation.State v. Lunn, 1971-NMCA-048, 82 N.M. 526, 484 P.2d 368.\n\nEffect of admission of illegal evidence.— In prosecution for first or second degree murder under Laws 1891, ch. 80, §§ 4, 5, 1063, 1064, 1897 C.L., repealed by Laws 1907, ch. 36, § 23, verdict of first degree murder could not stand unless it was apparent that no injury resulted from admission of illegal evidence.Territory v. Armijo, 1894-NMSC-003, 7 N.M. 428, 37 P. 1113.\n\nTranscript of taped confession.— Where the state conceded (during closing arguments) that the transcript of defendant's taped confession was erroneous, and the district court, counsel for the prosecution, and the defense counsel urged the jury to rely upon the tapes over the transcript as evidence, any misleading statements in the transcript were adequately corrected so that defendant's due process rights were not violated.State v. Boeglin, 1987-NMSC-002, 105 N.M. 247, 731 P.2d 943.\n\nAccomplice testimony sufficient.— Evidence, consisting primarily of accomplice testimony, was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find that defendant participated in a conspiracy to commit a murder, and actually participated in the murder, as well as the attempted murder of another victim.State v. Sarracino, 1998-NMSC-022, 125 N.M. 511, 964 P.2d 72.\n\nEvidence that defendant and the defendant's accomplice threw victim into the well while he was alive,then covered and finally resealed the well supports an inference that they reached an agreement to kill victim in the course of the robbery, and that both intended his death, supports the jury's verdict of guilty of first degree (felony) murder.State v. Lopez, 2005-NMSC-036, 138 N.M. 521, 123 P.3d 754.overruled on other grounds byState v. Frawley, 2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\nSufficient evidence of first-degree willful, deliberate and premediated murder.— Where defendant was charged with first-degree murder, and where at trial, defendant's first wife testified that defendant brought her to the crime scene to help him locate the shotgun shells used in the murder, that she saw the victim's body lying face down on the floor of the boxcar where the victim lived, that she knew defendant destroyed or concealed the clothes and shoes he wore during the murder, and that she lied to police about defendant's role in the killing because she was afraid of him, and where defendant's second wife testified that defendant told her that he shot the victim because the victim molested defendant's first wife when she was a teenager, and where an expert witness's testimony, that the victim died of being shot in the head with a shotgun fired at close range, corroborated defendant's ex-wives' testimony, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for willful, deliberate and premeditated murder.State v. Gutierrez, 2021-NMSC-008.\n\nEvidence sufficient for conviction.— Where defendant admitted that defendant shot toward a house multiple times with two different weapons while a party was in progress; other witnesses testified that defendant opened fire on the house without any one firing back at defendant; and the shots defendant fired at the house killed one victim, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's felony murder conviction.State v. Torrez, 2013-NMSC-034.\n\nWhere, following a fight at a bar between the victim and a conspirator, defendant and a conspirator assaulted the victim at a conspirator's residence and tied the victim up; defendant guarded the victim with a knife; another conspirator gave the victim an overdose of heroin; defendant and conspirators carried the victim to the victim's car and drove the car to a church; the victim was still alive; defendant tried three times to snap the victim's neck, a conspirator tried to suffocate the victim with a plastic bag, and defendant tried to strangle the victim with the victim's shoelaces; defendant and the conspirators left the church; after consulting with other conspirators, defendant and a conspirator returned to the church and set the victim and the victim's car on fire; and the victim's death was caused by the drug overdose and the fire, there was substantial evidence that defendant willfully, deliberately murdered the victim.State v. Gallegos, 2011-NMSC-027, 149 N.M. 704, 254 P.3d 655.\n\nEvidence that on the day deceased was shot, defendant visited the deceased's home on three different occasions, an argument developing between the two during the second visit and that when defendant returned for the third time he shot a witness and the deceased, along with the inferences the jury was entitled to draw from the evidence, was sufficient to sustain conviction of first degree murder.State v. Riggsbee, 1973-NMSC-109, 85 N.M. 668, 515 P.2d 964.\n\nWhere defendant had armed himself with a rock before entering victim's apartment, admitted striking the victim with the rock when she caught him in the house, and stated that she fell and hit her head against a table, the facts and circumstances unerringly established appellant's guilt of first degree murder beyond any reasonable doubt.State v. Jimenez, 1972-NMSC-073, 84 N.M. 335, 503 P.2d 315;State v. Sanders, 1994-NMSC-043, 117 N.M. 452, 872 P.2d 870;State v. Rojo, 1999-NMSC-001, 126 N.M. 438, 971 P.2d 829;State v. Trujillo, 2002-NMSC-005, 131 N.M. 709, 42 P.3d 814.\n\nThere was sufficient evidence to support a conviction for second degree murder where there was testimony that the defendant was present at the stabbing scene and argued with the victim, the knife belonged to the defendant, a witness saw the defendant with the knife, observed him open it, and testified that he washed blood off of it and instructed the witness to dispose of it, and where nobody else was involved in the altercation, the medical examiner testified that the fatal stab wound could have been made with the defendant's knife, and the defendant was apprehended fleeing from the scene shortly after the stabbing occurred.State v. Gurule, 2004-NMCA-008, 134 N.M. 804, 82 P.3d 975.\n\nWhere defendant was upset and depressed after defendant's girlfriend ended their six-year relationship; defendant made futile attempts to reconcile with defendant's girlfriend; defendant was obsessive about the relationship; defendant's girlfriend began dating the victim; defendant moved to California; while defendant was in California, defendant made statements to a witness in New Mexico that defendant was returning to New Mexico because defendant \"didn't take care of things\" before defendant left New Mexico and how defendant would \"just get everything done\"; when defendant returned to New Mexico, defendant broke into defendant's girlfriend's apartment and left a letter stating that defendant wished to reconcile and making threats regarding the victim; on the day of the murder, defendant and the victim began to argue about defendant's girlfriend; defendant went into defendant's apartment and immediately came running out of the apartment yelling \"I'll kill you\" as defendant began to shoot at the victim; defendant shot first about thirty-eight feet away from the victim and then ran towards the victim and fired four or five more shots; and defendant fired two shots less than four inches from the victim and then shot the victim a final time as the victim was attempting to escape from a car, there was substantial evidence to support the jury's conclusion that defendant killed the victim with deliberate intent.State v. Riley, 2010-NMSC-005, 147 N.M. 557, 226 P.3d 656.\n\nSufficient evidence of first-degree murder.— Where defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder, there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction where cell phone records showed that defendant and one of the shooting victims were in contact on the night of the murders, that text messages from the victim to defendant showed that the victim was upset with defendant, which could support an inference of a conflict between the two, where cell phone tower records indicated that defendant was in the area where the victim was murdered at the approximate time when the murders were believed to have occurred, and where a witness reported seeing defendant with a firearm only a few hours after the approximate time of the murders.State v. Carrillo, 2017-NMSC-023.\n\nSufficient evidence of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder.— Where defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder, and where the state presented evidence at trial that defendant spent the day before the murder with another man who had a motive to kill the victim, that defendant secured for himself and the other man a ride to the apartment complex where the victim lived, that defendant and the other man disappeared from sight before gunshots were heard, that defendant and the other man were seen running back to their vehicle before driving off, and that occupants of the vehicle testified that defendant smelled like burnt matches, which is similar to the smell of gunpowder, there was sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that defendant had the deliberate intent to kill the victim, that he helped in the planning of the crime, and that he actively participated in the actual attempt to kill the victim.State v. Torres, 2018-NMSC-013.\n\nLimitations to felony murder doctrine.— While the wording of this section is broad, New Mexico has created five main limitations to the felony murder doctrine to ensure that defendants convicted of felony murder have a culpable mental state consistent with the legislature's retributive and punitive goals..State v. O'Kelly, 2004-NMCA-013, 135 N.M. 40, 84 P.3d 88, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-001, 137 N.M. 17, 106 P.3d 578.\n\nAccomplices.— A defendant may not be held liable for depraved mind murder when he or his accomplice did not commit the lethal act that killed an innocent bystander.State v. O'Kelly, 2004-NMCA-013, 135 N.M. 40, 84 P.3d 88, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-001, 137 N.M. 17, 106 P.3d 578.\n\nX. JURY INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nRequisites of instructions.— All that can be required of court's instructions is that they properly give to the jury the essential facts which must be established beyond a reasonable doubt before the defendant can be convicted.State v. Anaya, 1969-NMSC-130, 80 N.M. 695, 460 P.2d 60.\n\nFailure to define crime.— An instruction on second degree murder which did not define the offense was insufficient.Territory v. Gutierrez, 1905-NMSC-018, 13 N.M. 138, 79 P. 716.\n\nInstruction on motive required.— Where all the evidence is circumstantial and there is no proof of motive, it was incumbent on trial judge to present a properly framed instruction on motive, instructing the jury that absence of evidence thereof should be considered along with all other circumstances in determining guilt or innocence of one accused of murder.State v. Vigil, 1975-NMSC-013, 87 N.M. 345, 533 P.2d 578.\n\nOffenses submitted depend on supporting evidence.— Defendant in murder trial had the right to have instructions on lesser included offenses submitted to the jury, but this right depended on there being some evidence tending to establish the lesser included offenses.State v. Anaya, 1969-NMSC-130, 80 N.M. 695, 460 P.2d 60.\n\nThe court was only required to charge as to such degrees of murder as evidence tended to sustain. It was the duty of the court to charge as to all such degrees, and failure to do so was error.Territory v. Romero, 1883-NMSC-006, 2 N.M. 474.\n\nAn accused is entitled to an instruction on second degree murder if there is some evidence in the record to support it.State v. Stephens, 1979-NMSC-076, 93 N.M. 458, 601 P.2d 428,overruled in part on other grounds byState v. Contreras, 1995-NMSC-056, 120 N.M. 486, 903 P.2d 228.\n\nEvidence to support instruction on intoxication.— To authorize an instruction on intoxication the record must contain some evidence showing or tending to show that defendant consumed an intoxicant and that the intoxicant affected his mental state at or near the time of the homicide. The instruction does not, however, require expert evidence regarding the effect of intoxication upon defendant's ability to form a deliberate intent to kill.State v. Privett, 1986-NMSC-025, 104 N.M. 79, 717 P.2d 55.\n\nTestimony from accomplices that murder defendant had consumed alcohol and methamphetamine on the evening of the murder, and expert testimony about the effect of those substances on the ability to form intent, was sufficient to warrant an instruction on intoxication.State v. Begay, 1998-NMSC-029, 125 N.M. 541, 964 P.2d 102.\n\nVoluntary intoxication instruction was not appropriate for second degree murder.— Where defendant, who had consumed a large quantify of alcohol and who was walking along a ditch with friends, encountered the victim; the friend began punching and kicking the victim; defendant provided the friend with a knife that the friend used to fatally stab the victim; and at trial, defendant requested an instruction on voluntary intoxication; and defendant was acquitted of conspiring to commit first degree murder and convicted of being an accessory to second degree murder, the voluntary intoxication instruction was not appropriate in the context of accessory liability for second degree murder, because second degree murder is a general intent crime.State v. Jim, 2014-NMCA-089, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-006.\n\nWhere defendant, who had consumed a large quantify of alcohol and who was walking along a ditch with friends, encountered the victim; the friend began punching and kicking the victim; defendant provided the friend with a knife that the friend used to fatally stab the victim; and at trial, defendant requested an instruction on voluntary intoxication; and defendant was acquitted of conspiring to commit first degree murder and convicted of being an accessory to second degree murder, the voluntary intoxication instruction was not appropriate in the context of accessory liability for second degree murder, because second degree murder is a general intent crime.State v. Jim, 2014-NMCA-089, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-006.\n\nSubmission of first degree charge required.— As there was evidence to the effect that the killing occurred while the defendant was in the commission of or an attempt to commit robbery, there was evidence from which the jury could have found that the homicide was committed while in the act of perpetrating a felony and the submission of the charge of first degree murder became a statutory mandate.State v. Torres, 1971-NMSC-039, 82 N.M. 422, 483 P.2d 303,overruled on other grounds byState v. Wilson, 1973-NMSC-093, 85 N.M. 552, 514 P.2d 603. ButseeState v. Harrison, 1977-NMSC-038, 90 N.M. 439, 564 P.2d 1321.\n\nWhere the defendant was engaged in committing a felony at time gun was accidentally discharged, trial court did not err in instructing that under the circumstances the accidental discharge did not reduce the homicide below first degree murder.State v. Smith, 1947-NMSC-035, 51 N.M. 184, 181 P.2d 800.\n\nUnder former law, it was not error for court to charge that there was no evidence to show that the killing of the deceased was justifiable, or that there was any circumstance to bring it within the definition of any degree of murder less than the first where all evidence showed that the killing took place during a robbery.Territory v. Romero, 1883-NMSC-006, 2 N.M. 474.\n\nDepraved mind instruction held improper.— Where defendant was charged with depraved mind murder involving a motor vehicle and the trial court instructed the jury that to find defendant guilty of first degree murder, the jury had to find that defendant drove defendant's vehicle erratically and recklessly for a long distance striking the victims, the jury instruction misstated the law on depraved mind murder, because the instruction did not require the jury to find that defendant's conduct was extremely reckless.State v. Dowling, 2011-NMSC-016, 150 N.M. 110, 257 P.3d 930.\n\nDefendant has burden to introduce evidence for lesser included offense instruction.— The defendant has the burden to come forward with evidence establishing sufficient provocation in order to be entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense.State v. Manus, 1979-NMSC-035, 93 N.M. 95, 597 P.2d 280,overruled on other grounds bySells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nInstruction on lesser degree improper.— Where state established a case which would have sustained conviction of first degree murder, instruction of the court permitting conviction of second degree murder was reversible error.State v. Reed, 1934-NMSC-085, 39 N.M. 44, 39 P.2d 1005.\n\nWhere evidence on charge of first degree murder did not tend to reduce crime to murder in the second degree, court was not authorized to instruct on second degree murder.State v. Granado, 1913-NMSC-017, 17 N.M. 542, 131 P. 497.\n\nWhere evidence showed either first degree murder or excusable homicide, it was proper to instruct the jury that in their verdict they must either find defendant guilty of first degree murder or not guilty, and court properly refused to give instructions in the second or third degrees.Sandoval v. Territory, 1896-NMSC-020, 8 N.M. 573, 45 P. 1125 (decided under prior law).\n\nIn murder prosecution, where evidence showed either murder in the first degree, or nothing, court properly instructed on first degree murder only.Faulkner v. Territory, 1892-NMSC-015, 6 N.M. 464, 30 P. 905.\n\nRefusal by the trial court to give an instruction on second degree murder is appropriate when the evidence simply did not support a finding of second degree murder. There was no evidence that the killing was anything less than deliberate and intentional.State v. Aguilar, 1994-NMSC-046, 117 N.M. 501, 873 P.2d 247, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 859, 115 S. Ct. 168, 130 L. Ed. 2d 105, and cert. denied, 513 U.S. 865, 115 S. Ct. 182, 130 L. Ed. 2d 116 (1994).\n\nInstructions on lesser degree mandatory.— Where there was no eyewitness to killing and death resulted from gunshot wound, and there was no evidence showing the murder was by poison or torture or lying in wait, or that it was perpetrated in committing, or attempting to commit a felony, failure to instruct jury other than on first degree murder was reversible error.Territory v. Padilla, 1896-NMSC-013, 8 N.M. 510, 46 P. 346;Aguilar v. Territory, 1896-NMSC-012, 8 N.M. 496, 46 P. 342.\n\nAdequate felony murder instruction described.— A jury instruction which requires the state to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, a causal relationship between the felony committed and the death of the victim is adequate.State v. Perrin, 1979-NMSC-050, 93 N.M. 73, 596 P.2d 516.\n\nFailure to instruct on the defining element of felony murder is fundamental error.- In a felony murder prosecution where the evidence will support a conviction for either second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter, it is fundamental error for the felony murder essential elements jury instruction to omit the defining requirement that the accused did not act in the heat of passion as a result of the legally adequate provocation that would reduce murder to manslaughter.State v. Montoya, 2013-NMSC-020, 306 P.3d 426.\n\nWhere defendant and defendant's companions were accosted by a rival gang in front of defendant's family home, guns were pulled on both sides and defendant's sibling was severely wounded by gunshots in the leg and abdomen; while defendant's group were trying to help defendant's sibling in the driveway and stop the bleeding, the person in the rival gang who had been shooting at defendant and defendant's companions returned in a Ford Expedition; when defendant saw gunfire coming from the Expedition, defendant ran into the house and retrieved an AK-47 rifle and began shooting at the Expedition; the driver of Expedition was shot seven times and died; the jury was instructed to consider felony murder based on the felony of shooting at the Expedition; the felony murder essential elements instruction omitted any reference to the concept of legally sufficient provocation that distinguished heat of passion voluntary manslaughter from cold blooded second degree murder; and there was ample evidence that the victim's provocative conduct against defendant and defendant's family occurred before defendant shot into the Expedition, the failure to include the distinction between second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter was fundamental error.State v. Montoya, 2013-NMSC-020, 306 P.3d 426.\n\nInstruction on intent when intent clear.— Failure to include the essential element of intent in a jury instruction for felony murder did not constitute fundamental error since the evidence was such that there could be no dispute that the defendant possessed the requisite intent.State v. Livernois, 1997-NMSC-019, 123 N.M. 128, 934 P.2d 1057.\n\nEvidence of premeditation.— Evidence that defendant had talked on numerous occasions of committing violent acts, including murder, and had made such statements on the night of the murder, was sufficient to establish premeditation.State v. Begay, 1998-NMSC-029, 125 N.M. 541, 964 P.2d 102.\n\nWaiver of instructions on lesser included offenses.— Consistent with the constitutional guarantees of a fair trial, the defendant in a first degree murder prosecution may take his chances with the jury by waiving instructions on lesser included offenses, even against the express advice of counsel, and cannot be heard to complain on appeal if he has gambled and lost.State v. Boeglin, 1987-NMSC-002, 105 N.M. 247, 731 P.2d 943.\n\nThe district court did not err by failing to give jury instructions on the lesser included offense.— Where defendant was convicted of attempted first degree murder following an incident where defendant fired a gun multiple times at occupants of a vehicle, and where defendant argued that the district court erred by failing to give a jury instruction on aggravated battery as a lesser included offense of attempted first degree murder, the district court did not err by failing to give jury instructions on the lesser included offense, because defendant requested two jury instructions, both of which were given to the jury, but defendant did not argue for or tender a proposed instruction for a lesser included offense. A defendant cannot be heard to complain if the district court instructed the jury as the defendant desired.State v. Bryant, 2023-NMCA-016, cert. denied.\n\nMissing element cured by separate instruction.— Trial court did not commit fundamental error by omitting the element of unlawfulness from the elements instruction on deliberate-intent first degree murder when the jury also received a separate proper instruction on self-defense.State v. Cunningham, 2000-NMSC-009, 128 N.M. 711, 998 P.2d 176.\n\nFirst and second degree properly submitted.— Where there was evidence presented which tended to indicate that sufficient time elapsed during which the defendant could have weighed his actions and considered their consequences and that the shooting was not in the heat of argument, instructions on first and second degree murder were proper.State v. Aragon, 1973-NMCA-102, 85 N.M. 401, 512 P.2d 974.\n\nAbsent request for instruction, no fundamental error.— Where the defendant does not request that an instruction be given and, consequently, it is not given, the trial court does not commit a fundamental error.State v. Stephens, 1979-NMSC-076, 93 N.M. 458, 601 P.2d 428,overruled in part on other grounds byState v. Contreras, 1995-NMSC-056, 120 N.M. 486, 903 P.2d 228.\n\nSubmission of second degree generally required, in absence of exceptions.— Except in a case where the very means employed in committing a homicide, as by torture, poison or lying in wait supply proof of the deliberation, the intensified malice, necessary to raise the grade of the offense to first degree as a matter of law, or unless it be one committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, a felony where by legislative fiat the circumstances under which the killing occurred render conclusive the presence of such deliberation, it is always necessary to submit second degree and thus permit the jury to say whether it is the one or the other - first or second degree.State v. Ortega, 1966-NMSC-185, 77 N.M. 7, 419 P.2d 219.\n\nIt was necessary to submit second as well as first degree murder to jury to permit them to determine degree of murder except when means employed in perpetrating crime supplied proof of deliberation or when homicide was committed in perpetrating or attempting another felony.State v. Kappel, 1949-NMSC-024, 53 N.M. 181, 204 P.2d 443.\n\nSecond degree instruction on intent.— In a prosecution for felony murder, giving of an unmodified form of UJI 14-210 on second degree murder, which allows for a verdict of guilt provided that, among other things, the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that \"[t]he defendant intended the killing to occur or knew that he was helping to create a strong probability of death or great bodily harm\" was sufficient without giving a general criminal intent instruction, which requires a higher level of criminal intent.State v. Nieto, 2000-NMSC-031, 129 N.M. 688, 12 P.3d 442.\n\nSecond degree instruction with sudden impulse theory.— Where confession of accused had been admitted and in it he stated that he had killed his wife on sudden impulse, it was error to refuse to instruct on second degree murder.State v. Wickman, 1935-NMSC-035, 39 N.M. 198, 43 P.2d 933.\n\nSecond degree instruction with self-defense theory.— Where prosecution attempted to prove first degree murder, perpetrated by lying in wait, and defendant pleaded self-defense, the court properly instructed jury on murder in the second degree.State v. Smith, 1921-NMSC-014, 26 N.M. 482, 194 P. 869.\n\nFailure to instruct on second degree.— When the defendant was convicted of felony murder and related crimes, the refusal to give an instruction on second degree murder was correct because the state proved a nexus between two felonies and the murder that excluded the possibility the murder was not committed in the commission of a felony.State v. McGruder, 1997-NMSC-023, 123 N.M. 302, 940 P.2d 150.\n\nSelf-defense instruction refused where defendant entered store with weapon, prepared to rob.— Where the defendant entered a store with a weapon, prepared to commit armed robbery if the circumstances permitted it, such facts can only reasonably point to the commission of a felony in a situation which is, of itself, \"inherently or foreseeably dangerous to human life,\" and a self-defense instruction is properly refused.State v. Chavez, 1983-NMSC-037, 99 N.M. 609, 661 P.2d 887.\n\nInstruction on defense of another.— Where defendant and the occupants of a house exchanged multiple gun shots; the shots defendant fired at the house killed one victim; defendant was tried for first degree murder with the predicate felony of shooting at a dwelling; defendant requested a jury instruction on defense of another on the grounds that shots from the house were fired in the direction of defendant's vehicle where two of defendant's friends were waiting; defendant's friends testified that they were not aware of any bullets reaching the vicinity of the car; defendant testified that defendant shot back at the house because people in the house were shooting at defendant; and there was no evidence that defendant shot to protect anyone other than defendant, the district court did not err in refusing to instruct on defense of another.State v. Torrez, 2013-NMSC-034.\n\nQuestion as to manner of killing.— Where evidence presented jury question as to manner in which killing occurred, instruction on second degree murder was properly given although state contended that crime constituted first degree murder.State v. Parks, 1919-NMSC-041, 25 N.M. 395, 183 P. 433.\n\nIt was not error to submit issue of second degree murder,where the accused was convicted of a degree of crime properly within the evidence.State v. Armstrong, 1956-NMSC-053, 61 N.M. 258, 298 P.2d 941.\n\nFailure to instruct on lesser included offense of vehicular homicide.— District court committed reversible error in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of vehicular homicide, where the evidence of the defendant's use of marijuana the night before and the morning of the killing could have supported a conviction of vehicular homicide while under the influence of drugs.State v. Omar-Muhammad, 1987-NMSC-043, 105 N.M. 788, 737 P.2d 1165.\n\nAggravated battery lesser included offense of attempted murder.— In a prosecution for attempted murder, the trial court properly instructed the jury on aggravated battery as a lesser included offense at the state's request, because the elements of the lesser crime were a subset of the elements of the charged crime and, further, the defendant could not have committed the greater offense in the manner charged in the indictment without also committing the lesser offense.State v. Meadors, 1995-NMSC-073, 121 N.M. 38, 908 P.2d 731.\n\nConvictions of attempted murder and aggravated battery violated double jeopardy.— Where defendant was convicted of attempted murder and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon; defendant's conduct was unitary; the indictment for attempted murder required the state to prove that defendant attempted to commit murder and \"began to do an act which constituted a substantial part of murder\" but failed to commit the offense; the indictment for aggravated battery required the state to prove that defendant touched or applied force to the victims with a deadly weapon intending to injure the victims; the state's theory of the case to support both charges was that defendant beat, stabbed, and slashed the victims; and the state offered the same testimony to prove both charges, the aggravated battery elements were subsumed within the attempted murder elements and defendant's convictions violated the prohibition against double jeopardy.State v. Swick, 2012-NMSC-018, 279 P.3d 747,rev'g2010-NMCA-098, 148 N.M. 895, 242 P.3d 462,overrulingState v. Armendariz, 2006-NMSC-036, 140 N.M. 182, 141 P.3d 526.\n\nFailure to instruct on aggravated battery.— The jury found the defendant guilty of attempted first degree murder, in that he had a deliberate intention to take the life of the victim, not that he simply had knowledge that his acts created a strong probability of great bodily harm. The jury having thus failed to find the lesser included offense of attempted murder in the second degree, the failure to instruct on aggravated battery was harmless.State v. Escamilla, 1988-NMSC-066, 107 N.M. 510, 760 P.2d 1276.\n\nWhen court has no duty to instruct on voluntary manslaughter.— Where neither prosecution nor defense in a murder trial requested an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, and both defendant and counsel stated that they did not desire such an instruction despite the court's explanation that there was sufficient evidence to warrant it, there was no duty for the trial court to instruct on voluntary manslaughter.State v. Najar, 1980-NMCA-033, 94 N.M. 193, 608 P.2d 169, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 628, 614 P.2d 545.\n\nNo instruction on provocation.— Defendant was not entitled to instructions specifically relating to his theory that a police officer's search of his house was illegal and constituted provocation so as to reduce murder to manslaughter.State v. Chamberlain, 1991-NMSC-094, 112 N.M. 723, 819 P.2d 673.\n\nInstruction on manslaughter improper.— It was error for the court to submit to the jury an issue of whether defendant was guilty of voluntary manslaughter when the facts established either first or second degree murder, but could not support a conviction of voluntary manslaughter and, accordingly, upon acquittal of murder and conviction of voluntary manslaughter, a reversal and discharge of the accused was required.State v. Lopez, 1968-NMSC-092, 79 N.M. 282, 442 P.2d 594.\n\nWhere evidence in prosecution for murder made it clear that defendant did not kill deceased \"upon a sudden quarrel, or in the heat of passion,\" or \"in the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony,\" or \"of a lawful act which might produce death in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection,\" so as to make the act \"manslaughter,\" instruction on manslaughter was not warranted.Territory v. Archuleta, 1911-NMSC-028, 16 N.M. 219, 114 P. 285.\n\nInstruction on voluntary manslaughter improper.— Where defendant, who was walking along a ditch with friends, encountered the victim; defendant's friend began punching and kicking the victim; defendant provided the friend with a knife that the friend used to fatally stab the victim; defendant was convicted of second degree murder; defendant argued that the district court should have instructed the jury on voluntary manslaughter because defendant was provoked by the instigation of the fight by defendant's friends, defendant perceived the victim to be a member of a rival gang that was responsible for a stabbing attack on defendant's friend that occurred within the preceding weeks, and the victim's reaction to the attack provoked defendant's response, defendant failed to establish sufficient provocation to support a voluntary manslaughter instruction.State v. Jim, 2014-NMCA-089, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-006.\n\nVarious theories submitted.— Where the evidence on provocation sufficient to reduce the killing from murder to voluntary manslaughter and the evidence of self-defense was conflicting, such questions were factual ones to be resolved by the jury, and the trial court properly submitted the issues of second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and self-defense to the jury.State v. King, 1977-NMCA-042, 90 N.M. 377, 563 P.2d 1170,overruled on other grounds byState v. Reynolds, 1982-NMSC-091, 98 N.M. 527, 650 P.2d 811.\n\nOverinclusive instruction intolerably confusing.— Defendant convicted of first degree murder for killing the victim by striking her with a cinder block after allegedly raping her was entitled to reversal of conviction, even in absence of objection by defendant at trial, where evidence supported judge's instruction on willful, deliberate or premeditated killing, but did not support instructions on theories of felony murder; murder by act dangerous to others, indicating depraved mind; or murder from deliberate and premeditated design unlawfully and maliciously to effect death of any human being (transferred intent). Such error was fundamental, since an intolerable amount of confusion was introduced into the case, and defendant could have been convicted without proof of all necessary elements.State v. DeSantos, 1976-NMSC-034, 89 N.M. 458, 553 P.2d 1265.\n\nOverinclusiveness reversible error.— Where defendant was indicted only under Subsection A(3) of this section (for felony murder), it was reversible error to include the willful, deliberate language of Subsection A(1) in the jury instructions.State v. Trivitt, 1976-NMSC-004, 89 N.M. 162, 548 P.2d 442.\n\nConfusing instruction on self-defense,critical issue in case, required reversal.State v. Garcia, 1971-NMCA-121, 83 N.M. 51, 487 P.2d 1356.\n\nConfusing instruction raised on appeal.— Giving of a confusing instruction on second degree murder which first included, then excluded, premeditation, was jurisdictional error, and could be first raised on appeal.State v. Buhr, 1971-NMCA-017, 82 N.M. 371, 482 P.2d 74.\n\nObjections to form must be preserved.— Where instructions on second degree murder included the elements of the offense, without uncertainty, and were not misleading, they contained neither jurisdictional defect nor fundamental error; asserted inadequacy as to their form, not called to the attention of the trial court, was not preserved for review.State v. Moraga, 1971-NMCA-103, 82 N.M. 750, 487 P.2d 178.\n\nError in instructions harmless.— Although the jury, not the judge or the district attorney, was to determine the sentence imposed for first degree murder, so that the trial court was in error in failing to submit to the jury a form of verdict calling for the death sentence, the error was harmless and could not be prejudicial to the accused.State v. Sanchez, 1954-NMSC-010, 58 N.M. 77, 265 P.2d 684.\n\nFailure to instruct on lesser charges upheld.— In the murder trial of a prisoner for killing a guard in which the death penalty was sought but not imposed, there was no fundamental miscarriage of justice because of the failure to instruct on second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter with respect to the officer's death, even though as an initial matter the evidence might have been sufficient to support such instructions, where the evidence supporting these lesser included offense instructions was not \"unequivocally strong.\"Trujillo v. Sullivan, 815 F.2d 597 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 929, 108 S. Ct. 296, 98 L. Ed. 2d 256 (1987) (decided under prior law).\n\nRefusal of cumulative instructions.— Where the trial court instructed the jury as to the statutory definition of murder in the first degree; in another instruction listed the essential elements thereof and instructed the jury that each of these elements must be proven to the jury's satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt; defined each of the essential terms, such as willfully, express malice, deliberation, etc.; and gave an instruction concerning the effect on defendant's state of mind from intoxication, it was not error in refusing defendant's requested instructions which were merely cumulative of the court's instruction.State v. Rushing, 1973-NMSC-092, 85 N.M. 540, 514 P.2d 297.\n\nTrial court was not in error when it refused to give defendant's requested instruction on exculpatory statements contained in his confession, since the court adequately instructed on self-defense, and since defendant's own testimony corresponded to the exculpatory matter contained in the confession.State v. Casaus, 1963-NMSC-194, 73 N.M. 152, 386 P.2d 246.\n\nUse of jury instructions.— New Mexico U.J.I. Crim. 2.00 (now seeUJI 14-201) does not change the necessary elements to be proven for a conviction of first degree murder, and it was not error to use it in advance of the effective date.State v. Noble, 1977-NMSC-031, 90 N.M. 360, 563 P.2d 1153.\n\nAnswering jury's questions.— Since, under 40-24-10, 1953 Comp., the jury had sole responsibility for fixing the penalty for murder in the first degree, it was not error for the trial court to answer the jury's inquiry for information relating to the possibility of parole or pardon or a verdict of life imprisonment by quoting applicable constitutional and statutory provisions.State v. Nelson, 1959-NMSC-023, 65 N.M. 403, 338 P.2d 301, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 877, 80 S. Ct. 142, 4 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1959) (decided under prior law).\n\nReview.— On appeal from conviction for second- degree murder, the court must review the evidence as to cause of death in the light most favorable to the state.State v. Ewing, 1968-NMCA-071, 79 N.M. 489, 444 P.2d 1000.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Confusing Law of Criminal Intent in New Mexico,\" see 5 N.M.L.

      "text": "Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice.\n\nA. Voluntary manslaughter consists of manslaughter committed upon a sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion.\n\nWhoever commits voluntary manslaughter is guilty of a third degree felony resulting in the death of a human being.\n\nB. Involuntary manslaughter consists of manslaughter committed in the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to felony, or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death in an unlawful manner or without due caution and circumspection.\n\nWhoever commits involuntary manslaughter is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-2-3, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 2-3; 1994, ch. 23, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For homicide by vehicle,see66-8-101 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor instruction on voluntary manslaughter,seeUJI 14-220.\n\nThe 1994 amendment,effective July 1, 1994, added \"resulting in the death of a human being\" at the end of the second paragraph of both Subsections A and B.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 1994, ch. 23, § 4 provided that the provisions of Laws 1994, ch. 23, § 2 apply only to persons sentenced for crimes committed on or after July 1, 1994.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nCrime and punishment properly separated.— The fact that the former manslaughter statute, 40-24-7, 1953 Comp., merely defined the offense, while 40-24-10, 1953 Comp., provided the penalty, does not mean that the statute was defective or the acts defined not crimes; crime and punishment can be separated and distinguished by the legislature.State v. McFall, 1960-NMSC-084, 67 N.M. 260, 354 P.2d 547 (decided under former law).\n\nApplicability to motor vehicle accidents.— This section, the involuntary manslaughter statute, was in no sense repealed by adoption of the negligent homicide statute (64-22-1, 1953 Comp.), but has been in full force and effect at all times; although cases of death resulting from driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor were taken out from under its operation by adoption of Section 66-8-102 NMSA 1978, which made driving under the influence a felony, because when a death resulted it would not be \"in the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony,\" upon repeal of the negligent homicide statute by Laws 1957, ch. 239, § 7, and reinstatement of the offense of driving under the influence as a misdemeanor by Laws 1955, ch. 184, § 8, the reapplicability of the involuntary manslaughter statute automatically ensued.State v. Deming, 1959-NMSC-074, 66 N.M. 175, 344 P.2d 481 (decided under former law).\n\nManslaughter is one of the four kinds of homicide,and is included within a charge of murder. State v. La Boon, 1960-NMSC-118, 67 N.M. 466, 357 P.2d 54;State v. McFall, 1960-NMSC-084, 67 N.M. 260, 354 P.2d 547.\n\nManslaughter included in murder.— Manslaughter is included in the charge of murder.State v. Rose, 1968-NMSC-091, 79 N.M. 277, 442 P.2d 589, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1028, 89 S. Ct. 626, 21 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1969).\n\nManslaughter not \"necessarily included\" in murder.— Under appropriate circumstances, where there is evidence that the defendant acted as a result of sufficient provocation, a charge of manslaughter could properly be said to be included in a charge of murder, and, accordingly, it would not be error to submit N.M.U.J.I. Crim. 2.20 (seeUJI 14-220 NMRA) to the jury; however, it cannot seriously be maintained that manslaughter is invariably \"necessarily included\" in murder, since different kinds of proof are required to establish the distinct offenses.Smith v. State, 1976-NMSC-085, 89 N.M. 770, 558 P.2d 39.\n\nOpen charge of murder adequate.— A charge of murder in violation of statutes pertaining to first and second degree murder and voluntary and involuntary manslaughter is not a charge of mutually exclusive crimes, nor is it a charge of distinct and separate offenses; rather, the charge is an open charge of murder, a form of charging approved, under which the jury is to be instructed on the degrees of the unlawful killing for which there is evidence, and it gave defendant notice that he must defend against a charge of unlawfully taking a human life.State v. King, 1977-NMCA-042, 90 N.M. 377, 563 P.2d 1170,overruled on other grounds byState v. Reynolds, 1982-NMSC-091, 98 N.M. 527, 650 P.2d 811.\n\nInformation sufficiently particular.— Information charging manslaughter, which enumerated the section defining the offense and the section fixing the penalty, did not contravene N.M. Const., art. II, § 14; although defendant was entitled \"to demand the nature and cause of the accusation,\" against him, that remedy was available by way of a bill of particulars.State v. Romero, 1961-NMSC-139, 69 N.M. 187, 365 P.2d 58.\n\nInformation insufficient.— An information was insufficient which charged that defendants willfully and feloniously killed named person contrary to statute.State v. Gray, 1934-NMSC-018, 38 N.M. 203, 30 P.2d 278.\n\nPermissible to convict accessory of lesser offense.— The fact that the accessory was convicted of involuntary manslaughter while the principal was convicted of voluntary manslaughter is a permissible result under the accessory statute.State v. Holden, 1973-NMCA-092, 85 N.M. 397, 512 P.2d 970, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 380, 512 P.2d 953.\n\nSuspension of convicted attorney.— Plea of guilty to crime of involuntary manslaughter, resulting from driving under the influence, supported recommendation of suspension of defendant attorney from practice of law.In re Morris, 1964-NMSC-235, 74 N.M. 679, 397 P.2d 475.\n\nII. VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.\n\nMeaning of \"unlawful\".— Subsection A defines voluntary manslaughter as \"the unlawful killing of a human being without malice upon a sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion\". From Section 30-2-1 NMSA 1978 it may be inferred that \"unlawful\" means \"without lawful justification or excuse.\"State v. Parish, 1994-NMSC-073, 118 N.M. 39, 878 P.2d 988.\n\nProvocation part of voluntary manslaughter.— Although the court has not ruled unequivocally either that provocation is or is not an \"element\" of voluntary manslaughter, there must be some evidence that the killing was committed upon a sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion in order for a conviction of voluntary manslaughter to stand; in this sense, provocation is a part of voluntary manslaughter.Smith v. State, 1976-NMSC-085, 89 N.M. 770, 558 P.2d 39.\n\nIntent.— Although voluntary manslaughter is a general intent crime, where attempted second degree murder is offered as a greater included offense and sufficient provocation is at issue in the trial, voluntary manslaughter may be a specific intent crime.State v. Jernigan, 2006-NMSC-003, 139 N.M. 1, 127 P.3d 537.\n\nAttempt.— Under limited circumstances, where attempted second degree murder is offered as a greater included offense and sufficient provocation is at issue in the trial, attempted voluntary manslaughter is a crime in New Mexico.State v. Jernigan, 2006-NMSC-003, 139 N.M. 1, 127 P.3d 537.\n\nAttempted voluntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of attempted second degree murder where sufficient provocation is at issue in the trial.State v. Jernigan, 2006-NMSC-003, 139 N.M. 1, 127 P.3d 537.\n\nProvocation and disclosure of provocation.— The provocation and the disclosure of the events constituting the provocation may occur at different times.State v. Munoz, 1992-NMCA-004, 113 N.M. 489, 827 P.2d 1303, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 352, 826 P.2d 573.\n\nNature of sufficient provocation.— To reduce the killing from murder to voluntary manslaughter all that is required is sufficient provocation to excite in the mind of the defendant such emotions as either anger, rage, sudden resentment or terror as may be sufficient to obscure the reason of an ordinary man, and to prevent deliberation and premeditation, and to exclude malice, and to render the defendant incapable of cool reflection.State v. Harrison, 1970-NMCA-071, 81 N.M. 623, 471 P.2d 193, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 668, 472 P.2d 382.\n\nEvidence of provocation sufficient to reduce a charge of second degree murder to voluntary manslaughter must be such as would affect the ability to reason and cause a temporary loss of self control in ordinary person of average disposition.State v. Jackson, 1983-NMCA-007, 99 N.M. 478, 660 P.2d 120,rev'd on other grounds, 1983-NMSC-098, 100 N.M. 487, 672 P.2d 660.\n\nProvocation has subjective and objective components.— Provocation is not strictly subjective. Defendant must demonstrate that defendant's extreme emotions would affect the ability to reason in an ordinary person.State v. Taylor, 2000-NMCA-072, 129 N.M. 376, 8 P.3d 863, cert. quashed, 131 N.M. 64, 33 P.3d 24.\n\nThe law does not permit one who intentionally instigates an assault on another to then rely on the victim's reasonable response to that assault as evidence of provocation sufficient to mitigate the subsequent killing of the victim from murder to manslaughter.State v. Gaitan, 2002-NMSC-007, 131 N.M. 758, 42 P.3d 1207;State v. Munoz, 1992-NMCA-004, 113 N.M. 489, 827 P.2d 1303, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 352, 826 P.2d 573.\n\nWords insufficient provocation.— No mere words, however opprobrious or indecent, were deemed sufficient to arouse ungovernable passion, so as to reduce a homicide from murder to manslaughter.State v. Trujillo, 1921-NMSC-111, 27 N.M. 594, 203 P. 846.See State v. Lujan, 1980-NMSC-036, 94 N.M. 232, 608 P.2d 1114, butsee Sells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nWords alone,however scurrilous or insulting, will not furnish adequate provocation to make a homicide voluntary manslaughter.State v. Castro, 1982-NMSC-125, 592 P.2d 185, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 621, 593 P.2d 62 (1979), butsee Sells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nWords and push insufficient provocation.— Even if it was true, as the defendant had told a witness, that his stepdaughter had pushed him and threatened that her father would come from California and kill him, this would not be adequate to constitute sufficient provocation and to require a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter.State v. Stills, 1998-NMSC-009, 125 N.M. 66, 957 P.2d 51.\n\n\"Informational words\" may constitute adequate provocation.— Informational words, as distinguished from mere insulting words, may constitute adequate provocation. The substance of the informational words spoken, the meaning conveyed by those informational words and the ensuing arguments and other actions of the parties, when taken together, can amount to provocation.Sells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nDiscipline of child not provocation.— Parent disciplining the parent's child, even with a slap to the child's face, is insufficient provocation as a matter of law to reduce the charge of second degree murder to voluntary manslaughter.State v. Taylor, 2000-NMCA-072, 129 N.M. 376, 8 P.3d 863, cert. quashed, 131 N.M. 64, 33 P.3d 284 (2001).\n\nSudden quarrel or passion mandatory.— Evidence of a sudden quarrel or heat of passion, tending to show provocation sufficient to negate malice and reduce the degree of felonious homicide from murder to manslaughter, is indispensable to a conviction for voluntary manslaughter.Smith v. State, 1976-NMSC-085, 89 N.M. 770, 558 P.2d 39.\n\nTo convict of voluntary manslaughter, the jury must have evidence that there was a sudden quarrel or heat of passion at the time of the commission of the crime (in order, under the common-law theory, to show that the killing was the result of provocation sufficient to negate the presumption of malice).Smith v. State, 1976-NMSC-085, 89 N.M. 770, 558 P.2d 39.See State v. Castro, 1979-NMCA-023, 92 N.M. 585, 592 P.2d 185, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 621, 593 P.2d 62.\n\nIt is voluntary manslaughter when the killing is committed upon a sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion.State v. Harrison, 1970-NMCA-071, 81 N.M. 623, 471 P.2d 193, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 668, 472 P.2d 382.\n\nSudden anger or heat of passion and provocation must concurto make a homicide voluntary manslaughter.State v. Castro, 1979-NMCA-023, 92 N.M. 585, 592 P.2d 185, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 621, 593 P.2d 62.\n\nProvocation must concur with sudden anger or heat of passion, such that an ordinary person would not have cooled off before acting.Sells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nEvidence of passion or quarrel sufficient.— Where there was sufficient evidence, even under the circumstances testified to by the appellant herself, from which the jury could find that the shooting occurred in the heat of passion or as the result of a sudden quarrel, there was sufficient evidence to sustain the manslaughter conviction.State v. Rose, 1968-NMSC-091, 79 N.M. 277, 442 P.2d 589, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1028, 89 S. Ct. 626, 21 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1969).\n\nEvidence of \"sudden quarrel\" insufficient.— Evidence which may support an inference of a smoldering desire within the defendant to avenge his former girl friend dating another male by doing away with both of them would not support an inference of a \"sudden quarrel\"; nor can such facts be held to give rise to that provocation recognized in the law as being adequate and proper to negate the presumption of malice.State v. Robinson, 1980-NMSC-049, 94 N.M. 693, 616 P.2d 406.\n\nPassion engendered by fear.— Instruction as to voluntary manslaughter was not error where, from defendant's own testimony, he shot deceased during heat of passion engendered by fear or terror.State v. Vargas, 1937-NMSC-049, 42 N.M. 1, 74 P.2d 62.\n\nTransference of passion theory unauthorized.— Where there was no evidence that such a condition as a sudden quarrel or the heat of passion existed between defendant and his baby boy, the only evidence of quarrel or heat of passion being between defendant and his wife, there was no evidence tending to establish voluntary manslaughter, since the weight of authority is against allowing transference of one's passion from the object of the passion to a related bystander.State v. Gutierrez, 1975-NMCA-121, 88 N.M. 448, 541 P.2d 628.\n\nTo reduce murder to voluntary manslaughter,victim must be source of provocation.State v. Manus, 1979-NMSC-035, 93 N.M. 95, 597 P.2d 280,overruled on other grounds by Sells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nDefendant initiates the provocation.— If the defendant intentionally caused the victim to do acts which the defendant could claim provoked him, he cannot kill the victim and claim that he was provoked; in such case, the circumstances show that he acted with malice aforethought, and the offense is murder.State v. Manus, 1979-NMSC-035, 93 N.M. 95, 597 P.2d 280,overruled on other grounds bySells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nActs of peace officer insufficient.— Acts of a peace officer exercising his duties in a lawful manner cannot rise to the level of sufficient provocation.State v. Martinez, 1982-NMCA-020, 97 N.M. 540, 641 P.2d 1087, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039;State v. Manus, 1979-NMSC-035, 93 N.M. 95, 597 P.2d 280,overruled on other grounds bySells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nExercise of legal right insufficient.— The exercise of a legal right, no matter how offensive, is not such provocation as lowers the grade of homicide from murder to voluntary manslaughter.State v. Manus, 1979-NMSC-035, 93 N.M. 95, 597 P.2d 280,overruled on other grounds bySells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162;State v. Marquez, 1981-NMCA-105, 96 N.M. 746, 634 P.2d 1298.\n\nDistinction between manslaughter and self-defense.— The line of demarcation between a homicide which amounts to voluntary manslaughter and one which amounts to justifiable homicide in self-defense is not always clearly defined and depends upon the facts of each case as it arises; those facts are for the jury, under instructions from the court.State v. Harrison, 1970-NMCA-071, 81 N.M. 623, 471 P.2d 193, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 668, 472 P.2d 382.\n\nSufficient evidence of voluntary manslaughter.— In defendant's trial for voluntary manslaughter, where the evidence established that the victim's actions in repeatedly charging at defendant aroused sufficient fear in defendant, which would affect his ability to reason and cause a temporary loss of self control, but that a reasonable person in the same circumstances would not have used a knife to stab the victim when the victim did not have a weapon, the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find sufficient provocation and that defendant's actions were not taken in self-defense.State v. Fox, 2017-NMCA-029, cert. granted.\n\nSelf-defense and provocation.— Self-defense and provocation supporting a conviction for voluntary manslaughter are not mutually incompatible.State v. Melendez, 1982-NMSC-039, 97 N.M. 738, 643 P.2d 607.\n\nConviction for manslaughter on failure of self-defense plea.— When facts are present which give rise to a plea of self-defense, it is not unreasonable that if the plea fails, the accused should be found guilty of voluntary manslaughter.State v. Harrison, 1970-NMCA-071, 81 N.M. 623, 471 P.2d 193, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 668, 472 P.2d 382;State v. Lopez, 1968-NMSC-092, 79 N.M. 282, 442 P.2d 594.\n\nWhenever the evidence is sufficient to raise a question of self-defense, an instruction on voluntary manslaughter should also be submitted to the jury if the evidence supports sufficient provocation of fear for one's own safety.State v. Abeyta, 1995-NMSC-052, 120 N.M. 233, 901 P.2d 164,overruled on other grounds byState v. Campos, 1996-NMSC-043, 122 N.M. 148, 921 P.2d 1266.\n\nNot manslaughter absent supporting evidence.— Where defendant contended he shot deceased solely to protect himself from a threatened attack, and stated that at the time he shot and killed deceased he was calm and cool, being by nature so disposed, the trial court was correct in refusing to submit the issue of voluntary manslaughter to the jury.State v. Luttrell, 1923-NMSC-024, 28 N.M. 393, 212 P. 739.\n\nUnnecessary force in defending self.— Defendant's choice of deadly force when confronted with a possible battery of less than deadly force would sustain a conviction of voluntary manslaughter but not for murder.State v. McLam, 1970-NMCA-129, 82 N.M. 242, 478 P.2d 570.\n\nKilling of fleeing, would-be felon.— A well-founded belief that a known felony was about to be committed will extenuate a homicide committed in prevention of the supposed crime, and this upon a principle of necessity; but when the necessity ceases, and the supposed felon flees, and thereby abandons his proposed design, a killing in pursuit, however well-grounded the belief may be that he intended to commit a felony, will not extenuate the offense of the pursuer.Brown v. Martinez, 1961-NMSC-040, 68 N.M. 271, 361 P.2d 152.\n\nElements distinguished between crimes.— Voluntary manslaughter and shooting at or from a motor vehicle resulting in great bodily harm have distinct elements.State v. Dominguez, 2005-NMSC-001, 137 N.M. 1, 106 P.3d 563.\n\nDeath not equated with great bodily harm.— Comparing the voluntary manslaughter statute with the shooting at or from a motor vehicle statute and the statutory definition of great bodily harm in Section 30-1-12 NMSA 1978, it is clear that the legislature does not \"equate\" death with great bodily harm.State v. Dominguez, 2005-NMSC-001, 137 N.M. 1, 106 P.3d 563.\n\nVoluntary manslaughter, aggravated battery and kidnapping.— Where defendant shot the victim in the chest in defendant's vehicle, drove the unconscious victim in the vehicle to an isolated area, and shot the victim twice in the head while the victim was still alive; and defendant used two different types of force to shoot the victim in the chest and to keep the victim's unconscious body in the vehicle, defendant's convictions of voluntary manslaughter for shooting the victim in the chest, aggravated battery for shooting the victim in the head, and kidnapping for keeping the victim in defendant's vehicle and transporting the victim to the isolated area were not based on unitary conduct and did not violate defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy.State v. Urioste, 2011-NMCA-121, 267 P.3d 820, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-012.\n\nNo double jeopardy violation for convictions.— Defendant's convictions of voluntary manslaughter and shooting at or from a motor vehicle do not violate double jeopardy.State v. Dominguez, 2005-NMSC-001, 137 N.M. 1, 106 P.3d 563.\n\nSeparate punishments intended.— The legislature intended to punish the crimes of voluntary manslaughter and shooting at or from a motor vehicle separately.State v. Dominguez, 2005-NMSC-001, 137 N.M. 1, 106 P.3d 563.\n\nCumulative punishment is precluded for shooting at a vehicle and homicide.— New Mexico jurisprudence precludes cumulative punishment for the offenses of causing great bodily harm to a person by shooting at a motor vehicle and the homicide resulting from the penetration of the same bullet into the same person.State v. Montoya, 2013-NMSC-020, 306 P.3d 426,overrulingState v. Gonzales, 1992-NMSC-003, 113 N.M. 221, 824 P.2d 1023,State v. Dominguez, 2005-NMSC-001, 137 N.M. 1, 106 P.3d 563 andState v. Riley, 2010-NMSC-005, 147 N.M. 557, 226 P.3d 656.\n\nWhere defendant and defendant's companions were accosted by a rival gang in front of defendant's family home, guns were pulled on both sides and defendant's sibling was severely wounded by gunshots in the leg and abdomen; while defendant's group were trying to help defendant's sibling in the driveway and stop the bleeding from the gunshot wounds, the person in the rival gang who had been shooting at defendant and defendant's companions returned in a Ford Expedition; when defendant saw gunfire coming from the Expedition, defendant ran into the house and retrieved an AK-47 rifle and began shooting at the Expedition; the driver of Expedition was shot seven times and died; the jury convicted defendant of voluntary manslaughter and shooting into a motor vehicle resulting in great bodily harm, the Double Jeopardy Clause protected defendant from being punished both for the homicide of the victim and for shooting into a vehicle causing great bodily harm to the victim where both convictions were premised on the unitary act of shooting the victim.State v. Montoya, 2013-NMSC-020, 306 P.3d 426,overrulingState v. Gonzales, 1992-NMSC-003, 113 N.M. 221, 824 P.2d 1023,State v. Dominguez, 2005-NMSC-001, 137 N.M. 1, 106 P.3d 563 andState v. Riley, 2010-NMSC-005, 147 N.M. 557, 226 P.3d 656.\n\nAccidental killingwill not support conviction of voluntary manslaughter.State v. Lopez, 1968-NMSC-092, 79 N.M. 282, 442 P.2d 594.\n\nDiminished responsibility for manslaughter.— The defense of diminished responsibility is analogous to that of insanity, in that expert testimony on the issue of diminished responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect is not conclusive on the fact finder. The jury is free to believe or disbelieve such testimony, and if such testimony is disbelieved the presumption of full responsibility, which is viewed as included in the presumption of sanity, remains in effect.State v. Holden, 1973-NMCA-092, 85 N.M. 397, 512 P.2d 970, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 380, 512 P.2d 953.\n\nIssue of responsibility properly submitted.— Evidence of insanity may be so overwhelming as to require the direction of a verdict of acquittal, as may be evidence of diminished responsibility. Where the evidence was not of such a quality as to require a directed verdict, the issue of defendant's responsibility for the crime of voluntary manslaughter was properly submitted to the jury.State v. Holden, 1973-NMCA-092, 85 N.M. 397, 512 P.2d 970, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 380, 512 P.2d 953.\n\nEffect of conviction unsupported by evidence.— It is error for the court to submit to the jury an issue of whether defendant was guilty of voluntary manslaughter when the facts establish either first or second degree murder, but could not support a conviction of voluntary manslaughter and, accordingly, upon acquittal of murder and conviction of voluntary manslaughter, a reversal and discharge of the accused is required.State v. Lopez, 1968-NMSC-092, 79 N.M. 282, 442 P.2d 594.\n\nNo double jeopardy violations for sentence enhancements.— Upon conviction of voluntary manslaughter, with firearm enhancement, imposition of a three-year sentence under this section, plus an additional three-year sentence under 31-18-15 NMSA 1978, and an additional one-year firearm enhancement, did not result in multiple punishments for the same offense in violation of double jeopardy.State v. Alvarado, 1997-NMCA-027, 123 N.M. 187, 936 P.2d 869.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where the victim was smoking and injecting methamphetamine; the victim's behavior became increasingly erratic; the victim was playing with two knives; defendant wrestled with the victim, attempting to disarm and restrain the victim; the victim was uncontrollable, violent, and wild; defendant put the victim in a \"choke hold\" on three occasions, but did not choke the victim to unconsciousness; each time defendant released the victim, the victim continued to violently struggle; even though defendant eventually duct taped the victim, the victim continued to struggle; the victim eventually stopped breathing and could not be revived; and the victim's death was caused by cervical compression or neck compression with physical restraint and methamphetamine intoxication as contributing causes, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of voluntary manslaughter.State v. Maples, 2013-NMCA-052, 300 P.3d 739, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-004.\n\nIII. INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter statute excludes all cases of intentional killing,and includes only unintentional killings by acts unlawful, but not felonious, or lawful, but done in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection; the killing must be unintentional to constitute involuntary manslaughter, and, if it is intentional and not justifiable, it belongs in some one of the classes of unlawful homicide of a higher degree than involuntary manslaughter.State v. King, 1977-NMCA-042, 90 N.M. 377, 563 P.2d 1170,overruled on other grounds,State v. Reynolds, 1982-NMSC-091, 98 N.M. 527, 650 P.2d 811.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter was confined to cases where the killing was unintentional.State v. Pruett, 1921-NMSC-110, 27 N.M. 576, 203 P. 840.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter may be committedby both unlawful and lawful acts.State v. Grubbs, 1973-NMCA-096, 85 N.M. 365, 512 P.2d 693,overruled on other grounds,Santillanes v. State, 1993-NMSC-012, 115 N.M. 215, 849 P.2d 358;State v. Yarborough, 1995-NMCA-116, 120 N.M. 669, 905 P.2d 209.\n\nDistinction between lawful and unlawful acts.— In distinguishing between unlawful and lawful acts, the statute applies the language, defined by the courts to mean criminal negligence, only to the lawful act portion of the statute.State v. Grubbs, 1973-NMCA-096, 85 N.M. 365, 512 P.2d 693,overruled on other grounds,Santillanes v. State, 1993-NMSC-012, 115 N.M. 215, 849 P.2d 358;State v. Yarborough, 1995-NMCA-116, 120 N.M. 669, 905 P.2d 209.\n\nCriminal negligence is not element of involuntary manslaughter by unlawful actunder Subsection B, nor the negligence which is a part of Section 30-7-4 NMSA 1978 (relating to negligent use or handling of a weapon).State v. Grubbs, 1973-NMCA-096, 85 N.M. 365, 512 P.2d 693,overruled on other grounds,Santillanes v. State, 1993-NMSC-012, 115 N.M. 215, 849 P.2d 358;State v. Yarborough, 1995-NMCA-116, 120 N.M. 669, 905 P.2d 209.\n\nCriminal negligence required for involuntary manslaughter by lawful act.— A killing by lawful act, to be involuntary manslaughter, depends on whether the lawful act was done in an unlawful manner or without due caution and circumspection. The phrase \"without due caution and circumspection\" has been held to involve the concept of \"criminal negligence,\" which concept includes conduct which is reckless, wanton or willful.State v. Grubbs, 1973-NMCA-096, 85 N.M. 365, 512 P.2d 693,overruled on other grounds,Santillanes v. State, 1993-NMSC-012, 115 N.M. 215, 849 P.2d 358;State v. Yarborough, 1995-NMCA-116, 120 N.M. 669, 905 P.2d 209.\n\nShowing of criminal negligence is requiredfor conviction of involuntary manslaughter, whether based on an \"unlawful act\" or \"lawful act\".State v. Yarborough, 1995-NMCA-116, 120 N.M. 669, 905 P.2d 209,aff'd, 1996-NMSC-068, 122 N.M. 596, 930 P.2d 131.\n\nReckless disregard of others.— Merely driving on the wrong side of the road could be inadvertence and not sufficient to convict, but driving on the wrong side of the road coming up a hill, where visibility was obstructed, showed a heedless and reckless disregard of the rights of others.Garrett v. Howden, 1963-NMSC-222, 73 N.M. 307, 387 P.2d 874.\n\nInadvertently allowing an automobile to encroach upon the wrong side of the road while going up an incline so steep cars beyond its crest may not be seen constitutes a reckless, willful and wanton disregard of consequences to others, and will support conviction for manslaughter if one be killed as a result thereof.State v. Rice, 1954-NMSC-037, 58 N.M. 205, 269 P.2d 751.\n\nNegligent use of weapon.— A conviction of involuntary manslaughter by negligent use of a weapon requires negligence which is ordinary.State v. Grubbs, 1973-NMCA-096, 85 N.M. 365, 512 P.2d 693,overruled on other grounds,Santillanes v. State, 1993-NMSC-012, 115 N.M. 215, 849 P.2d 358;State v. Yarborough, 1995-NMCA-116, 120 N.M. 669, 905 P.2d 209.\n\nUse of firearm enhancement for negligent use.— Under the facts of this case, the state was required to prove that the defendant negligently used a firearm to commit a noncapital felony and this conduct resulted in the death of a human being. Use of a firearm is the same conduct required to enhance the defendant's sentence under Section 31-18-16A NMSA 1978. Because the state would not be required to prove any additional facts in order to have the defendant's sentence enhanced, the firearm enhancement statute is subsumed within the offense of involuntary manslaughter by negligent use of a firearm.State v. Franklin, 1993-NMCA-135, 116 N.M. 565, 865 P.2d 1209.\n\nDefense to involuntary manslaughter.— Defendant charged with involuntary homicide could raise the theory of self-defense and was entitled to a jury instruction on her theory of defense of another. Any anomalies in the evidence will be resolved by the properly instructed jury.State v. Gallegos, 2001-NMCA-021, 130 N.M. 221, 22 P.3d 689, cert. denied, 130 N.M. 459, 26 P.3d 103.\n\nNegligent self-defense as involuntary manslaughter.— If defendant could be viewed as in a position where his safety or the safety of his friend was threatened, and if in an attempt to protect himself or ward off the attackers, defendant inadvertently shot the victim, then his actions could be viewed as a lawful act of self-defense committed in a unlawful manner or without due caution and circumspection, such that an instruction on involuntary manslaughter based on negligent self-defense should have been given.State v. Arias, 1993-NMCA-007, 115 N.M. 93, 847 P.2d 327,overruled on other grounds,State v. Abeyta, 1995-NMSC-052, 120 N.M. 233, 901 P.2d 164,overruled on other grounds,State v. Campos, 1996-NMSC-043, 122 N.M. 148, 921 P.2d 1266.\n\nIf a defendant shoots someone in imperfect self-defense, the charge of murder can only be mitigated to voluntary manslaughter and an instruction on involuntary manslaughter is inappropriate.State v. Abeyta, 1995-NMSC-052, 120 N.M. 233, 901 P.2d 164,overruled on other grounds,State v. Campos, 1996-NMSC-043, 122 N.M. 148, 921 P.2d 1266.\n\nAccidental shooting in process of imperfect self-defense.— While a claim of imperfect self-defense does not give rise to the need for an involuntary manslaughter instruction, a claim of accidental shooting might; furthermore, it is possible for an accidental shooting to occur in the process of imperfect self-defense.State v. Abeyta, 1995-NMSC-052, 120 N.M. 233, 901 P.2d 164,overruled on other grounds,State v. Campos, 1996-NMSC-043, 122 N.M. 148, 921 P.2d 1266.\n\nResisting search.— Homicide committed in resisting deputy sheriff who was searching defendant's house without a warrant was involuntary manslaughter if the resistance constituted a misdemeanor, as when the deputy was merely engaged in the \"execution of his office,\" and instruction leaving jury to determine the degree of murder was erroneous.State v. Welch, 1933-NMSC-084, 37 N.M. 549, 25 P.2d 211.\n\nInflicting a beating is unlawful act.State v. Holden, 1973-NMCA-092, 85 N.M. 397, 512 P.2d 970, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 380, 512 P.2d 953.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter instruction improper.— Inflicting a beating is an unlawful act, and accordingly, there was no basis for an instruction on involuntary manslaughter by lawful act, nor was there any basis for an instruction on manslaughter by unlawful act not amounting to a felony at defendant's trial for murder of his baby boy.State v. Gutierrez, 1975-NMCA-121, 88 N.M. 448, 541 P.2d 628.\n\nNo foundation for involuntary theory.— Where the uncontradicted evidence showed that defendant killed her husband with two and possibly three well-placed shots into his person fired at close range while he lay on the couch and defendant stood over him with a pistol purchased by defendant earlier in the day, and immediately following a discussion about the victim leaving the defendant, no foundation existed for an instruction on involuntary manslaughter, and the trial court properly refused to instruct on this theory of the case.State v. Gardner, 1973-NMSC-034, 85 N.M. 104, 509 P.2d 871, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 851, 94 S. Ct. 145, 38 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1973).\n\nIntentional shooting not involuntary manslaughter.— The killing of a person by intentionally shooting him with a rifle, if not justified by the law of self-defense, would constitute at least an assault with a deadly weapon, and would be a felony, and hence not involuntary manslaughter.State v. Pruett, 1921-NMSC-110, 27 N.M. 576, 203 P. 840.\n\nHomicide by vehicle statute preempts manslaughter statute.— The specific homicide by vehicle statute, Section 66-8-101 NMSA 1978, preempts the involuntary manslaughter statute in unintentional vehicular homicide cases.State v. Yarborough, 1995-NMCA-116, 120 N.M. 669, 905 P.2d 209,aff'd, 1996-NMSC-068, 122 N.M. 596, 930 P.2d 131.\n\nCareless driving statute,Section 66-8-114 NMSA 1978, which requires a showing of only civil negligence, cannot be used as the basis for involuntary manslaughter.State v. Yarborough, 1995-NMCA-116, 120 N.M. 669, 905 P.2d 209,aff'd, 1996-NMSC-068, 122 N.M. 596, 930 P.2d 131.\n\nEvidence insufficient to convict.— Evidence that defendant was driving an unfamiliar car over relatively unfamiliar roads, that 800 feet north of where the accident occurred defendant drove over a hill with a 2% grade with a curve at the bottom of it and did not slow down, that defendant had consumed two beers before the accident, and that, unknown to defendant, the tire that blew out was defective, even when considered cumulatively, failed to disclose the state of mind required to be shown for a conviction under this section.State v. Hayes, 1966-NMSC-260, 77 N.M. 225, 421 P.2d 439.\n\nB. PROXIMATE CAUSE.\n\nProximate cause requisite for conviction.— Unlawful act must constitute proximate cause of the homicide to warrant a conviction of involuntary manslaughter.State v. Seward, 1942-NMSC-002, 46 N.M. 84, 121 P.2d 145.\n\nProximate cause not necessarily direct immediate cause.— The act of defendant must be a proximate cause of death but need not be the direct immediate cause; it is sufficient if the direct cause resulted naturally from the act of accused.State v. Fields, 1964-NMSC-230, 74 N.M. 559, 395 P.2d 908.\n\nProximate cause in reckless driving.— Wanton and reckless operation of an automobile which must be shown as proximate cause of a death in order to secure a conviction for involuntary manslaughter is not different from that required to be shown under former guest statute (Section 64-24-1, 1953 Comp.) before one injured may recover against driver host.State v. Hayes, 1966-NMSC-260, 77 N.M. 225, 421 P.2d 439;State v. Clarkson, 1954-NMSC-007, 58 N.M. 56, 265 P.2d 670.\n\nHeedless or reckless disregard of others.— To establish heedlessness or reckless disregard of the right of others, a particular state of mind that comprehends evidence of an utter irresponsibility on the part of the defendant or of a conscious abandonment of any consideration for the safety of passengers must be established.State v. Hayes, 1966-NMSC-260, 77 N.M. 225, 421 P.2d 439.\n\nCriminal negligence in driving while intoxicated.— The act of an intoxicated person in driving an automobile recklessly might be such criminal negligence as would warrant a finding of manslaughter if such operation of the automobile was the proximate cause of death.State v. Sisneros, 1938-NMSC-049, 42 N.M. 500, 82 P.2d 274.\n\nContributory negligence no defense.— Conduct of the driver of car struck by defendant had no application in trial for manslaughter, since it was the criminal negligence of defendant that caused the deaths of the two victims.State v. Romero, 1961-NMSC-139, 69 N.M. 187, 365 P.2d 58.\n\nEvidence of reckless driving as proximate cause sufficient.— Evidence that defendant struck vehicle in which decedents were riding on a well-lighted street from the rear, that he was driving at a speed of between 60 to 80 m.p.h. in a 35 m.p.h. zone immediately prior to the collision and that he was intoxicated, established beyond any reasonable doubt that his conduct in driving was the proximate cause of the accident, and that it was so reckless, wanton and willful as to show an utter disregard for the rights of others.State v. Romero, 1961-NMSC-139, 69 N.M. 187, 365 P.2d 58.\n\nProximate cause not recklessness.— Where statements of defendant and his companion, which were introduced by the state, and not controverted, negatived any wanton or reckless operation of the car, or any high speed, and were corroborated to a great extent by a witness for the state who was a companion of the deceased at the time of the accident, the evidence did not establish that the proximate cause of the fatal striking of deceased was the wanton or reckless operation of the vehicle by the defendant.State v. Clarkson, 1954-NMSC-007, 58 N.M. 56, 265 P.2d 670.\n\nNor unlawfully carrying weapon.— Involuntary manslaughter was not proved by evidence that a loaded revolver fell to the floor at a public dance and discharged, killing another, since unlawful act of carrying the weapon was not proximate cause of death.State v. Nichols, 1930-NMSC-032, 34 N.M. 639, 288 P. 407.\n\nInstruction on unlawful act improper absent proximate cause.— Unless it could be said that failure of a defendant to have a driver's license in his possession at time and place of accident was the proximate cause of death, an instruction that defendant was guilty of involuntary manslaughter if it was found he operated the automobile without a license or was under influence of intoxicating liquor would be erroneous.State v. Seward, 1942-NMSC-002, 46 N.M. 84, 121 P.2d 145.\n\nIV. EVIDENCE.\n\nProof beyond reasonable doubt.— The burden of proof on the part of the state to support a charge of manslaughter by automobile beyond a reasonable doubt is clearly established in New Mexico.State v. Rice, 1954-NMSC-037, 58 N.M. 205, 269 P.2d 751.\n\nEstablishment of corpus delicti.— In homicide cases, proof of the corpus delicti is established when it is shown that the person whose death is alleged in the information is in fact dead, and that the death was criminally caused.State v. Romero, 1961-NMSC-139, 69 N.M. 187, 365 P.2d 58.\n\nProof of corpus delicti was established beyond a reasonable doubt where witness testified that his wife and son were dead at the scene of the accident, that he took the bodies to South Carolina, and was present when they were interred there.State v. Romero, 1961-NMSC-139, 69 N.M. 187, 365 P.2d 58.\n\nProof of victim's identity mandatory.— In this state, proof that the person killed is the same person as the one charged in the indictment to have been killed is part of the corpus delicti; failure so to prove is more than a variance between the charge and the proof, it is a failure to prove that the crime charged has been committed.State v. Vallo, 1970-NMCA-002, 81 N.M. 148, 464 P.2d 567 (ordering defendant discharged since the judgment was reversed for failure of proof rather than error in the trial proceedings).\n\nMisrepresentation of polygraph's accuracy.— Verdict of jury finding defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter was tainted by introduction of testimony calculated to prejudice the jury by implying that polygraph test was the ultimate in tests for truth, which testimony cast doubts upon the truth and veracity of the defendant in a manner not countenanced by the courts; it would not be allowed to stand.State v. Varos, 1961-NMSC-099, 69 N.M. 19, 363 P.2d 629, distinguished in,State v. Chavez, 1969-NMCA-109, 80 N.M. 786, 461 P.2d 919 (decided under former law).\n\nUnrelated crimes.— Interjection of criminal offenses of narcotics pushing and heroin smuggling in the opening statement and on cross-examination, which offenses were irrelevant to the homicide for which defendant was being tried, constituted reversible error under the circumstances.State v. Garcia, 1971-NMCA-121, 83 N.M. 51, 487 P.2d 1356.\n\nThreat inadmissible.— Threat made by defendant against narcotics agent some 14 months prior to the crime, which did not point with any reasonable certainty to deceased, a police officer, individually or as a member of a class, and about which deceased was not shown to have had any knowledge, was not admissible as bearing on defendant's actions toward deceased or to show why deceased acted as he did.State v. Garcia, 1971-NMCA-121, 83 N.M. 51, 487 P.2d 1356.\n\nAdmitting evidence of threats prejudicial error.— Since a basic contention of defense was that defendant acted in self-defense, improper admission of testimony as to a threat made by defendant was prejudicial error.State v. Garcia, 1971-NMCA-121, 83 N.M. 51, 487 P.2d 1356.\n\nPhotographs of body.— The admission into evidence in a murder trial of photographs of the decedent taken during her autopsy is proper if they are reasonably relevant to material issues in the trial, showing the identity of the victim, and the number and location of the wounds inflicted upon her body.State v. Ho'o, 1982-NMCA-158, 99 N.M. 140, 654 P.2d 1040, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 148, 655 P.2d 160.\n\nV. JURY INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nCriminal negligence instruction.— A showing of criminal negligence is required for a conviction of involuntary manslaughter, and it was fundamental error for the trial court to have not so instructed the jury.State v. Kirby, 1996-NMSC-069, 122 N.M. 609, 930 P.2d 144.\n\nWhere defendant's testimony provided a factual basis for an instruction on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter, the trial court committed reversible error in denying defendant's requested instruction. A trial court must instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter if the defense requests such an instruction and the instruction is warranted under the facts of the case.State v. Munoz, 1992-NMCA-004, 113 N.M. 489, 827 P.2d 1303, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 352, 826 P.2d 573.\n\nProvocation.— Words alone, however scurrilous or insulting, will not furnish adequate provocation to require submission of a voluntary manslaughter instruction. However, if there is evidence to raise the inference that by reason of actions and circumstances the defendant was sufficiently provoked, then the jury should be given the voluntary manslaughter instruction. The substance of the informational words spoken, the meaning conveyed by those informational words, the ensuing arguments and other actions of the parties, when taken together, could amount to provocation. The defendant is entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of murder in the first degree if there is evidence to support, or tending to support, such an instruction.Sells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter instruction.— Where there is sufficient evidence of both criminal negligence and accident, it is proper to grant an involuntary manslaughter instruction.State v. Skippings, 2011-NMSC-021, 150 N.M. 196, 258 P.3d 1008.\n\nThemens reafor involuntary manslaughter is criminal negligence.— An involuntary manslaughter jury instruction is proper only when the evidence presented at trial permits the jury to find the defendant had a mental state of criminal negligence when engaging in the act causing the victim's death.State v. Henley, 2010-NMSC-039, 148 N.M. 359, 237 P.3d 103.\n\nEvidence of excessive self-defense and accident are not a substitute for evidence of criminal negligence.— The confluence of evidence of imperfect self-defense with evidence of accidental shooting is not a substitute for evidence of the criminal negligence mental state required for an involuntary manslaughter conviction, because if the homicide is accidental, defendant acted without a criminally culpable state of mind in performing a lawful act unintentionally killing the victim, and if the homicide occurred as a result of imperfect self-defense, defendant acted intentionally in self-defense and the use of excessive force rendered the killing lawful, whereas, an involuntary manslaughter instruction is proper only where there is evidence of an unintentional killing and amens reaof criminal negligence.State v. Henley, 2010-NMSC-039, 148 N.M. 359, 237 P.3d 103.\n\nEvidence did not support instruction on involuntary manslaughter.— Where the evidence most favorable to defendant showed that defendant was sitting in a car; the victim approached the car and held a gun to defendant's head; defendant grabbed the gun and it discharged; defendant gained control of the gun and fired it at the victim; and defendant then drove away without realizing that the victim had been shot, the evidence failed to establish a mental state of criminal negligence, which is required to support a jury instruction on involuntary manslaughter.State v. Henley, 2010-NMSC-039, 148 N.M. 359, 237 P.3d 103.\n\nEvidence supported instruction on involuntary manslaughter.— Where defendant shot and killed an intruder that failed to identify himself while pounding on defendant's front door at 1:30 a.m., an instruction on involuntary manslaughter was warranted because a reasonable jury could have determined that defendant was either criminally negligent because firing a gun at the door while someone was on the other side of it was a willful disregard of the rights or safety of others and endangered that unknown intruder, that defendant unintentionally killed the intruder based on defendant's theory that he fired a warning shot, or that defendant committed the lawful act of self-defense and unintentionally killed the victim without due caution or circumspection.State v. Cardenas, 2016-NMCA-042, cert. denied.\n\nDefendant was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter instruction as a lesser included offense of second-degree murder.— Where defendant was convicted of second-degree murder based on evidence that he shot and killed the victim, a friend of defendant's, while defendant was playing with a gun that he believed to be unloaded, the district court erred in denying defendant's requested jury instruction on involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of second-degree murder, because there was evidence to support both charges and reasonable minds could differ regarding whether defendant committed involuntary manslaughter by negligent use of a firearm or second-degree murder by aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.State v. Young, 2021-NMCA-049.\n\nSubmission of issue proper.— In prosecution on information charging first degree murder, the submission of voluntary manslaughter was not error.State v. Burrus, 1934-NMSC-036, 38 N.M. 462, 35 P.2d 285.\n\nQuestion of provocation.— Generally, it is for the jury to determine whether there is sufficient provocation under an appropriate instruction on voluntary manslaughter.Sells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nQuestion of degree for jury.— Where the evidence on provocation sufficient to reduce the killing from murder to voluntary manslaughter and the evidence of self-defense was conflicting, such questions were factual ones to be resolved by the jury, and the trial court properly submitted the issues of second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and self-defense to the jury.State v. King, 1977-NMCA-042, 90 N.M. 377, 563 P.2d 1170,overruled on other grounds,State v. Reynolds, 1982-NMSC-091, 98 N.M. 527, 650 P.2d 811.\n\nDefendant entitled to manslaughter instruction.— Any evidence tending to bring homicide within grade of manslaughter entitled defendant to instruction on the law of manslaughter, and it was fatal error to refuse it.State v. Crosby, 1920-NMSC-037, 26 N.M. 318, 191 P. 1079.\n\nIf there is enough circumstantial evidence to raise an inference that the defendant was sufficiently provoked to kill the victim, he is entitled to an instruction on manslaughter.State v. Martinez, 1981-NMSC-016, 95 N.M. 421, 622 P.2d 1041.\n\nDefendant is entitled to instruction on voluntary manslaughterif there is some evidence to support it.State v. Maestas, 1981-NMSC-006, 95 N.M. 335, 622 P.2d 240;State v. Marquez, 1981-NMCA-105, 96 N.M. 746, 634 P.2d 1298.\n\nThe defendant is entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of murder in the first degree if there is evidence to support, or tending to support, such an instruction.Sells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nWhen court has no duty to instruct on voluntary manslaughter.— Where neither prosecution nor defense in a murder trial requested an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, and both defendant and counsel stated that they did not desire such an instruction despite the court's explanation that there was sufficient evidence to warrant it, there was no duty for the trial court to instruct on voluntary manslaughter.State v. Najar, 1980-NMCA-033, 94 N.M. 193, 608 P.2d 169, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 628, 614 P.2d 545.\n\nTrial court's refusal to instruct the jury on voluntary and involuntary manslaughter was not improper where defendant was guilty of transporting a gun by a convicted felon and of endangering another by handling a firearm in a negligent manner, and where there was evidence that he intentionally fired at the victim's vehicle.State v. Salazar, 1997-NMSC-044, 123 N.M. 778, 945 P.2d 996.\n\nAttempted voluntary manslaughter instruction.— Defendant's testimony that he was scared when he believed other party was reaching for a gun provides evidence of sufficient provocation to support an attempted voluntary manslaughter instruction.State v. Jernigan, 2006-NMSC-003, 139 N.M. 1, 127 P.3d 537.\n\nInstructions incomplete.— In homicide prosecution where one of defendant's theories was involuntary manslaughter, and record was replete with testimony that defendant was drunk while he rode around in automobile with deceased and witness, holding and handling sawed-off shotgun, court's refusal to instruct the jury that negligent use of a weapon while under the influence of intoxicant was a petty misdemeanor left jury without a guide to determine whether this was a killing while in the commission of a misdemeanor, and was reversible error.State v. Durham, 1971-NMCA-168, 83 N.M. 350, 491 P.2d 1161.\n\nOverinclusive instruction erroneous.— Where trial court, at commencement of trial, removed the issue of manslaughter by \"commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner or without due caution and circumspection\" from the case, it was reversible error to reinject this false issue into the case by including it in the definition of involuntary manslaughter given the jury in the instructions, and instructing the jury that in order to find defendant guilty it must find that his conduct was of the kind described in the definition.State v. Salazar, 1954-NMSC-062, 58 N.M. 489, 272 P.2d 688.\n\nSufficiency of the evidence assessed against the elements of the crime charged.— Where defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter, and where the jury was instructed on the essential elements of involuntary manslaughter, but the jury instruction contained an additional element not contained in UJI 14-231 NMRA, the additional element did not become an essential element under the statute, because the sufficiency of the evidence is assessed against the elements of the crime charged. Therefore, where the defendant did not dispute that he was properly charged with the statutory elements for involuntary manslaughter, that he was given a meaningful opportunity to defend himself against those charges, or that the evidence was sufficient to convict him of the statutory elements of involuntary manslaughter, defendant was properly convicted of involuntary manslaughter.State v. Carpenter, 2016-NMCA-058.\n\nSeparate instructions not necessary.— Claim that the trial court should have instructed separately on the law applicable to crime of homicide resulting from driving under the influence and resulting from reckless driving was without merit, where jury was adequately instructed as to the proof required in either circumstance.State v. Fields, 1964-NMSC-230, 74 N.M. 559, 395 P.2d 908.\n\nErroneous to submit unsupported issue of manslaughter.— It is error for the court to submit to the jury an issue of whether defendant was guilty of voluntary manslaughter when the facts establish either first or second degree murder, but could not support a conviction of voluntary manslaughter and, accordingly, upon acquittal of murder and conviction of voluntary manslaughter, a reversal and discharge of the accused is required.Smith v. State, 1976-NMSC-085, 89 N.M. 770, 558 P.2d 39.\n\nIt is reversible error to submit, in a murder case, the issue of voluntary manslaughter to the jury where no such issue is involved in the evidence.State v. Luttrell, 1923-NMSC-024, 28 N.M. 393, 212 P. 739;State v. Trujillo, 1921-NMSC-111, 27 N.M. 594, 203 P. 846;State v. Pruett, 1921-NMSC-110, 27 N.M. 576, 203 P. 840;State v. Lujan, 1980-NMSC-036, 94 N.M. 232, 608 P.2d 1114.\n\nBecause misleading to jury.— A party is entitled to have the jury instructed on all correct legal theories of his case which are supported by substantial evidence but in this case the court's refusal to give the involuntary manslaughter instruction was correct where to have given the requested instruction, which included acts for which there was no evidentiary support, would have introduced false issues and would have been misleading to the jury.LaBarge v. Stewart, 1972-NMCA-119, 84 N.M. 222, 501 P.2d 666, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 219, 501 P.2d 663.\n\nNo right to instruction on blood alcohol test refusal.— Nothing in N.M. Const., art. II, §§ 14 or 15, or in statutory or case law, gives defendant in prosecution for manslaughter the legal right to have jury instructed that he had right to refuse to take a blood alcohol test.State v. Fields, 1964-NMSC-230, 74 N.M. 559, 395 P.2d 908.\n\nStanding to complain.— Where the appellant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, he could not complain of error in court's instruction in regard to murder.State v. Carabajal, 1920-NMSC-086, 26 N.M. 384, 193 P. 406.\n\nReview of requested instruction.— Since the instruction on voluntary manslaughter was given at defendant's request, the appeals court can refuse to review since the trial court merely instructed the jury as the defendant requested.State v. Young, 1994-NMCA-061, 117 N.M. 688, 875 P.2d 1119, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 773, 877 P.2d 579.\n\nOmission of words \"without malice\".— Omission of words \"without malice\" in instruction in prosecution for voluntary manslaughter did not decrease amount of proof required to convict.Territory v. Trapp, 1911-NMSC-073, 16 N.M. 700, 120 P. 702,rev'd on other grounds, 225 F. 968 (8th Cir. 1915).\n\nInstruction upon manslaughter which did not tell jury that the killing must be without malice was beneficial rather than harmful to defendant, and he could not complain thereof.State v. Carabajal, 1920-NMSC-086, 26 N.M. 384, 193 P. 406.\n\nFailure to preserve error in instruction.— Defective instruction which failed to advise the jury that defendant's reckless and wanton operation of his automobile must have been proximate cause of victim's death would not be considered on appeal where not raised in the trial court prior to reading of instruction to jury.State v. Clarkson, 1954-NMSC-007, 58 N.M. 56, 265 P.2d 670.\n\nHealth and safety violations.— Subsection B of this section is applicable to violations of the New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Act. 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-32.\n\nWillful violation of a state occupational health and safety standard which causes the death of an employee would appear to constitute a violation of Subsection B of this section. 1973 Op.

Assisting suicide consists of deliberately aiding another in the taking of the person's own life, unless the person aiding another in the taking of the person's own life is a person acting in accordance with the provisions of the End-of-Life Options Act [Chapter 24, Article 7C NMSA 1978].\n\nB. A person who commits assisting suicide is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-2-5, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 2-5; 2021, ch. 132, § 10.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective June 18, 2021, removed criminal liability for aiding another in the taking of another person's life if the person is acting in accordance with the provisions of the End-of-Life Options Act; added new subsection designations \"A\" and \"B\"; in Subsection A, after \"own life\", deleted \"Whoever\" and added \"unless the person aiding another in the taking of the person's own life is a person acting in accordance with the provisions of the End-of-Life Options Act\"; and in Subsection B, added \"A person who\".\n\nPhysician aid in dying is prohibited by this section.— The practice of aid in dying involves a physician deliberately prescribing a lethal dose of barbiturates with the understanding that the patient will self-administer the entire dose to end his or her life, should the patient choose to do so, conduct clearly encompassed by the plain language of 30-2-4 NMSA 1978.Morris v. Brandenburg, 2016-NMSC-027,aff'g2015-NMCA-100, 356 P.3d 564.\n\nConstitutionality.— Where petitioners, two doctors and their patient, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to the effect that either 30-2-4 NMSA 1978, New Mexico's criminal statute prohibiting assisted suicide, did not apply to the conduct defined by petitioners as physician aid in dying, or even if the statute did apply to physician aid in dying, such an application would be unconstitutional, petitioners failed to establish a fundamental liberty interest protected by the inherent rights clause or the due process clause of the New Mexico constitution, because the inherent rights clause has never been interpreted to be the exclusive source for a fundamental constitutional right, and on its own has always been subject to reasonable regulation, and there is a firm legal rationale behind the interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession, the interest in protecting vulnerable groups, including the poor, the elderly, and disabled persons, from abuse, neglect, and mistakes due to the risk of subtle coercion and undue influence in end-of-life situations, and the legitimate concern that recognizing a right to physician aid in dying will lead to voluntary or involuntary euthanasia.Morris v. Brandenburg, 2016-NMSC-027,aff'g2015-NMCA-100, 356 P.3d 564.\n\nConstitutionality.— Aid in dying is not a fundamental liberty interest under the New Mexico constitution, and therefore a mentally competent, terminally ill patient's interest in a physician's assistance in dying is not a fundamental liberty interest protected by the due process clause of N.M. Const., Art. II, § 18 and is not entitled to protection under the state constitutional provision protecting inherent individual rights to life, liberty and happiness provided for in N.M. Const. Art. II, § 4. The district court, holding otherwise, erred in permanently enjoining the state from enforcing 30-2-4 NMSA 1978.Morris v. Brandenberg, 2015-NMCA-100, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nAid in dying is prohibited by this section.— A patient's choice to achieve a peaceful end of life through aid in dying, or the practice of a willing physician providing a lethal dose of a prescribed medication at the request of a mentally competent, terminally ill patient, is the taking of one's own life, and thus suicide within the meaning of this section; a physician's conduct of providing a patient a lethal dose of a prescribed medication, and thus the means to take his or her own life, is prohibited by this section.Morris v. Brandenberg, 2015-NMCA-100, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nSecond degree murder, assisted suicide, not same offense.— The second degree murder statute (Section 30-2-1B NMSA 1978) is aimed at preventing an individual from actively causing the death of someone contemplating suicide, whereas the assisting suicide statute is aimed at preventing an individual from providing someone contemplating suicide with the means to commit suicide. Thus, the two statutes do not condemn the same offense.State v. Sexson, 1994-NMCA-004, 117 N.M. 113, 869 P.2d 301, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 215, 870 P.2d 753.\n\nSuicide pact not exemption from conviction for murder.— The existence of a suicide pact does not exempt someone from a conviction for committing murder. However, that general rule may not apply if the means of attempted suicide used presents the same risk to both of the parties at the same time, such as when a couple drive off a cliff together. Such is not the case when the victim is killed by a rifle, the trigger of which is pulled by the defendant.State v. Sexson, 1994-NMCA-004, 117 N.M. 113, 869 P.2d 301, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 215, 870 P.2d 753.\n\nSuicide pact not assisting suicide.— There was enough evidence to support a conviction of second degree murder because there was sufficient evidence to show that the defendant actively participated in a suicide by holding the gun to the victim's head and pulling the trigger. \"Aiding\", in the context of determining whether one is criminally liable for their involvement in the suicide of another, is intended to mean providing the means to commit suicide, not actively performing the act which results in death.State v. Sexson, 1994-NMCA-004, 117 N.M. 113, 869 P.2d 301, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 215, 870 P.2d 753.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 40 Am.

      "text": "A. Homicide is justifiable when committed by a public officer or public employee or those acting by their command and in their aid and assistance:\n\n(1) in obedience to any judgment of a competent court;\n\n(2) when necessarily committed in overcoming actual resistance to the execution of some legal process or to the discharge of any other legal duty;\n\n(3) when necessarily committed in retaking felons who have been rescued or who have escaped or when necessarily committed in arresting felons fleeing from justice; or\n\n(4) when necessarily committed in order to prevent the escape of a felon from any place of lawful custody or confinement.\n\nB. For the purposes of this section, homicide is necessarily committed when a public officer or public employee has probable cause to believe he or another is threatened with serious harm or deadly force while performing those lawful duties described in this section. Whenever feasible, a public officer or employee should give warning prior to using deadly force.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-2-7, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 2-7; 1989, ch. 222, § 1.\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective June 16, 1989, added the present designation for Subsection A, redesignated former Subsections A through D as Paragraphs (1) through (4) of present Subsection A, and added present Subsection B.\n\nLegislative recognition of common law.— This section and Section 30-2-7 NMSA 1978 are in reality a legislative recognition of the common law which empowered officers to perform their duty of apprehending and bringing felons to the bar of justice.Alaniz v. Funk, 1961-NMSC-140, 69 N.M. 164, 364 P.2d 1033.\n\nArresting officer to use best judgment.— When the state sends an officer to make an arrest for a felony, he must use his best judgment to make the arrest, peaceably if he can, but forcibly if he must.Alaniz v. Funk, 1961-NMSC-140, 69 N.M. 164, 364 P.2d 1033.\n\nUse of necessary force in making arrest.— An officer having the right to arrest an offender may use such force as is necessary to effect his purpose, to the extent of taking life.State v. Vargas, 1937-NMSC-049, 42 N.M. 1, 74 P.2d 62.\n\nDanger of the suspect.— Under this section the crucial consideration is the conduct and dangerousness of the suspect, not the classification of the crime that he or she has committed or is alleged to have committed.State v. Mantelli, 2002-NMCA-033, 131 N.M. 692, 42 P.3d 272, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 737, 42 P.3d 842.\n\nUse of deadly force.— While this section speaks of justifiable homicide, the appellate court reads it as authorizing the use of deadly force by law enforcement officers whether or not the suspect is ultimately killed.State v. Mantelli, 2002-NMCA-033, 131 N.M. 692, 42 P.3d 272, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 737, 42 P.3d 842.\n\nReasonableness a jury question.— Generally, the question of the reasonableness of the actions of the officer in using lethal force to apprehend a felon is a question of fact for the jury.Alaniz v. Funk, 1961-NMSC-140, 69 N.M. 164, 364 P.2d 1033.\n\nIt is apparent, through the inclusion of \"probable cause\" in Subsection B, that the reasonableness of an individual police officer's actions is an objective analysis evaluated from his perspective at the time of the incident and is necessarily a factual inquiry.State v. Mantelli, 2002-NMCA-033, 131 N.M. 692, 42 P.3d 272, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 737, 42 P.3d 842.\n\nSelf-defense authorized.— A self-defense instruction is required whenever a defendant presents evidence sufficient to allow reasonable minds to differ as to all elements of the defense; this is also the standard that should be applied when determining if the jury should be instructed on justifiable homicide by a police officer in accordance with this section.State v. Mantelli, 2002-NMCA-033, 131 N.M. 692, 42 P.3d 272, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 737, 42 P.3d 842.\n\nAlthough an officer must not kill for an escape where the party is in custody for a misdemeanor, if the party assaults the officer with such violence that he had reasonable ground to believe his life in peril, he may justify killing the party.State v. Vargas, 1937-NMSC-049, 42 N.M. 1, 74 P.2d 62.\n\nLarge rocks, hurled by misdemeanant at deputy sheriff in resisting arrest, were dangerous weapons, justifying resort to extreme measures on part of deputy.State v. Vargas, 1937-NMSC-049, 42 N.M. 1, 74 P.2d 62.\n\nDuty not to retreat.— In a wrongful death suit, where the evidence showed that decedent committed at least two felonies in the presence of police officers, the officers' duty, when he fired upon them, was not to retreat but to press forward and place him under physical restraint, and, in so doing, the officers could defend themselves and use deadly force if such were justified by the circumstances.Cordova v. City of Albuquerque, 1974-NMCA-101, 86 N.M. 697, 526 P.2d 1290.\n\nInstruction appropriate.— Officer charged with killing one resisting an arrest for felony was entitled to have jury instructed as to what constitutes justifiable homicide.Territory of New Mexico v. Gutierrez, 1905-NMSC-018, 13 N.M. 138, 79 P. 716.\n\nLaw reviews.— For symposium, \"The Impact of the Equal Rights Amendment on the New Mexico Criminal Code,\" see 3 N.M.L. Rev. 106 (1973).\n\nAm.

      "text": "Homicide is justifiable when committed by any person in any of the following cases:\n\nA. when committed in the necessary defense of his life, his family or his property, or in necessarily defending against any unlawful action directed against himself, his wife or family;\n\nB. when committed in the lawful defense of himself or of another and when there is a reasonable ground to believe a design exists to commit a felony or to do some great personal injury against such person or another, and there is imminent danger that the design will be accomplished; or\n\nC. when necessarily committed in attempting, by lawful ways and means, to apprehend any person for any felony committed in his presence, or in lawfully suppressing any riot, or in necessarily and lawfully keeping and preserving the peace.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-2-8, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 2-8.\n\nImperfect self-defense.— Imperfect self-defense, which occurs when a person uses excessive force while otherwise lawfully engaging in self-defense, is not a true affirmative defense for which a defendant is entitled to an instruction. Any issues raised by a defendant's claim of imperfect self-defense are properly addressed when the jury is instructed on voluntary manslaughter.State v. Herrera, 2014-NMCA-007, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nRecognition of common law.— This section and Section 30-2-6 NMSA 1978 are in reality a legislative recognition of the common law which empowered officers to perform their duty of apprehending and bringing felons to the bar of justice.Alaniz v. Funk, 1961-NMSC-140, 69 N.M. 164, 364 P.2d 1033.\n\nThree elements necessary before self-defense instruction can be givenare: (1) an appearance of immediate danger of death or great bodily harm to the defendant; (2) the defendant was in fact put in such fear; and (3) a reasonable person would have reacted in a similar manner.State v. Martinez, 1981-NMSC-016, 95 N.M. 421, 622 P.2d 1041.\n\nDefendant's use of force in response to lawful defense of habitation was not objectively reasonable and therefore he was not entitled to a self-defense instruction.— In defendant's trial for first-degree murder, the district court did not err in denying defendant's requested jury instruction on self-defense where the uncontested evidence demonstrated that defendant's provocative acts constituted a basis for the householder and her guest to reasonably believe that defendant intended to commit a violent felony upon one or more of the dwellers in the habitation, and because the householder or her guest were entitled to use deadly force under such circumstances, defendant's responsive use of deadly force in firing a gunshot into the residence was not an objectively reasonable act of self-defense.State v. Galindo, 2024-NMSC-004.\n\nMultiple attacker.— While a person may act in self-defense against multiple attackers acting in concert, this principle applies only to the extent that each accomplice poses an immediate danger of death or great bodily harm, thereby necessitating an act of self-defense.State v. Coffin, 1999-NMSC-038, 128 N.M. 192, 991 P.2d 477.\n\nRetaliation.— Self-defense is defined by the objectively reasonable necessity of the action and does not extend to a defendant's act of retaliation for another's involvement in a crime against the defendant.State v. Coffin, 1999-NMSC-038, 128 N.M. 192, 991 P.2d 477.\n\nProvocation by defendant.— A defendant who provokes an encounter, as a result of which the defendant finds it necessary to use deadly force in defense, cannot claim defendant was acting in self-defense.State v. Lucero, 1998-NMSC-044, 126 N.M. 552, 972 P.2d 1143;State v. Chavez, 1983-NMSC-037, 99 N.M. 609, 661 P.2d 887.\n\nExcessive force.— The use of excessive force in self-defense is not reasonable and does not entitle one to a self-defense instruction.State v. Sutphin, 2007 NMSC-045, 142 N.M. 191, 164 P.3d 72.\n\nTo warrant self-defense instruction evidence must raise reasonable doubtin the minds of the jury as to whether or not a defendant accused of homicide did act in self-defense.State v. Martinez, 1981-NMSC-016, 95 N.M. 421, 622 P.2d 1041.\n\nSubjective apprehension of harm necessary.— It was not sufficient to justify the taking of human life that a person had reason to apprehend death or great bodily harm to himself unless he killed his assailant; he must entertain such belief and must be acting upon it.State v. Parks, 1919-NMSC-041, 25 N.M. 395, 183 P. 433.\n\nThreat of great personal injury.— Laws 1853-1854, p. 86, (former 40-24-13, 1953 Comp.), defining homicide as justifiable when committed in lawful self-defense on reasonable ground to apprehend some great personal injury meant something more than apprehension, however imminent, of a mere battery, not amounting to a felony, and required an apparent design either to take the life or inflict great personal injury on the person assailed, amounting to a felony, if carried out, and imminent danger of such design being accomplished.Territory v. Baker, 1887-NMSC-021, 4 N.M. (Gild.) 236, 13 P. 30.\n\nDefense of chastity.— Woman accused of voluntary manslaughter was entitled, on written request, to special instruction on her claim of defense of her chastity.State v. Martinez, 1924-NMSC-075, 30 N.M. 178, 230 P. 379.\n\nDefense of habitation authorized.— The defense of habitation alone, without a statute making it a felony to unlawfully and maliciously injure a house, gave householder the right to meet force with force, and \"an attack upon a dwelling, and especially in the night, the law regards as equivalent to an assault on a man's person, for a man's house is his castle.\"State v. Couch, 1946-NMSC-047, 52 N.M. 127, 193 P.2d 405.\n\nWhile no law countenances wanton slaying, the protection and security of life being the most vital interest of society, the law of habitation and the resistance to the commission of a felony thereon gave householder the right to kill the aggressor, if such killing was necessary or apparently necessary to prevent or repel the felonious aggression.State v. Couch, 1946-NMSC-047, 52 N.M. 127, 193 P.2d 405.\n\nHouseholder not obliged to retreat.— When one's home was attacked in the middle of a dark night by persons riding in an automobile, the householder, being unable to determine what weapons the assailants had, was not obliged to retreat but might pursue his adversaries until out of danger.State v. Couch, 1946-NMSC-047, 52 N.M. 127, 193 P.2d 405.\n\nSubstantial injury to dwelling not necessary.— Instruction that injury to a dwelling, to be felonious so as to justify killing, must be of a substantial character constituted a prejudicial error.State v. Couch, 1946-NMSC-047, 52 N.M. 127, 193 P.2d 405.\n\nProperty other than dwelling.— Under former law, trespass upon real estate not the dwelling house of accused did not of itself justify or excuse killing of trespasser.State v. Martinez, 1929-NMSC-040, 34 N.M. 112, 278 P. 210.\n\nApprehension of suspected felon.— Deadly force in the apprehension of suspected felons is justifiable only when the citizen has probable cause to believe he or she is threatened with serious bodily harm or the use of deadly force.State v. Johnson, 1998-NMCA-019, 124 N.M. 647, 954 P.2d 79.\n\nRequisites of instructions.— It is not imperative that the charge to the jury use the precise terms of the statute; instructions are sufficient which substantially follow the language of the statute or use equivalent language, adequately covering every phase of the case raised by the evidence on which the defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed.State v. Maestas, 1957-NMSC-057, 63 N.M. 67, 313 P.2d 337.\n\nJury to consider threat of danger from defendant's standpoint.— Where defense of habitation is invoked in homicide case, the danger or apparent danger must be considered from the standpoint of accused, and not according to the actual facts as they developed at the trial.State v. Couch, 1946-NMSC-047, 52 N.M. 127, 193 P.2d 405.\n\nThe jury was adequately instructed where it was charged that if it reasonably appeared to the defendant that his brother was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury, then the defendant had a right to use such force as would appear reasonably necessary to repel the attack, and the jury was further instructed to view the matter from defendant's viewpoint, even though it afterward appeared that no injury was intended and no danger existed.State v. Maestas, 1957-NMSC-057, 63 N.M. 67, 313 P.2d 337.\n\nInstruction on right to act in view of wife's health.— Refusal of instruction relating to defendant's right to act in view of his wife's condition and effect which repeated assaults upon the habitation had had upon her health was reversible error.State v. Couch, 1946-NMSC-047, 52 N.M. 127, 193 P.2d 405.\n\nWhen self-defense instruction mandatory.— Where self-defense is involved in a criminal case and there is any evidence, although slight, to establish the same, it is not only proper for the court, but its duty as well, to instruct the jury fully and clearly on all phases of the law on the issues that are warranted by the evidence, even though such defense is supported only by the defendant's own testimony.State v. Heisler, 1954-NMSC-032, 58 N.M. 446, 272 P.2d 660.\n\nEvidence held to support theory of self-defense.— The recovery of a spent bullet, after trial, from under the hood of the defendant's car, and evidence regarding its angle of entry and rifling characteristics consistent with its having been fired by a gun of the type and caliber known by police to be owned by the victim, was not merely cumulative evidence, but was a material piece of demonstrative evidence strengthening the defendant's theory of self-defense.State v. Melendez, 1981-NMCA-027, 97 N.M. 740, 643 P.2d 609,rev'd on other grounds, 1982-NMSC-039, 97 N.M. 738, 643 P.2d 607.\n\nWhen inappropriate.— If the evidence in the case is insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether a defendant accused of a homicide did act in self-defense, any instruction on that issue is properly refused.State v. Heisler, 1954-NMSC-032, 58 N.M. 446, 272 P.2d 660.\n\nInstructions properly refused.— In prosecution for assault with intent to kill, refusal to instruct that person has a right to defend his property from trespass or larceny, and that jury should acquit defendant if it found he shot at prosecuting witness to stop him from removing defendant's property and that such action was necessary to prevent, it was not error where evidence did not show prosecuting witness was on land leased by defendant at time of assault and in light of instructions given.State v. Waggoner, 1946-NMSC-001, 49 N.M. 399, 165 P.2d 122.\n\nLaw reviews.— For symposium, \"The Impact of the Equal Rights Amendment on the New Mexico Criminal Code,\" see 3 N.M.L. Rev. 106 (1973).\n\nAm.

      "text": "A. The acquiring, profiting or anticipating of benefits by reason of the commission of murder where the person committing such crime is convicted of either a capital, first or second degree felony, is against the public policy of this state and is prohibited.\n\nB. In all cases involving devises or bequests, or heirships under the laws of descent and distribution, or cotenancies, or future interests, or community estates, or contracts, whether of real, personal or mixed properties, where a person, who, by committing murder and where such person is convicted of either a capital, first or second degree felony, and might receive some benefit therefrom either directly or indirectly, the common-law maxim to the effect that one cannot take advantage of his own wrong, shall control and be applied to the interpretation, construction and application of all statutes or decisions of this state in order to deprive and prevent him from profiting from such wrongful acts.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-2-10, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 2-10.\n\nApplicability.— This statute clearly requires a conviction of murder. Where defendant was convicted of vehicular homicide, a third degree felony, the forfeiture provision does not apply.Aranda v. Camacho, 1997-NMCA-010, 122 N.M. 763, 931 P.2d 757.\n\nSection distinct from common law.— This section is not merely declaratory of the common law, nor is it a mere extension of or addition to the common-law maxim that a beneficiary may not profit by his own crime.Rose v. Rose, 1968-NMSC-115, 79 N.M. 435, 444 P.2d 762.\n\nNature of prohibition.— If the legislature had intended it as merely declaratory of the common law, it would have been easy to have said that one who is convicted of feloniously causing the death of another shall not benefit therefrom. However, the legislature, by express and unambiguous language, prohibited only those convicted of murder from so profiting.Rose v. Rose, 1968-NMSC-115, 79 N.M. 435, 444 P.2d 762.\n\nMatter for legislature.— This is a legislative matter, and where, in 1942, prior to passage of Laws 1955, ch. 61, providing that a murderer could not inherit the estate of his victim, defendant killed his mother, pleading guilty to murder in the second degree for the crime, the court would refuse to amend or set aside the unambiguous statutes of descent and distribution under which the property of the mother descended to the son.Reagan v. Brown, 1955-NMSC-064, 59 N.M. 423, 285 P.2d 789.\n\nCriminal proceeding determinative.— The question of whether the insured was murdered by the person to whom the property would ordinarily go is one to be judicially determined, the legislature having seen fit to provide that such determination must be ascertained in a criminal proceeding.Rose v. Rose, 1968-NMSC-115, 79 N.M. 435, 444 P.2d 762.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Perils of Intestate Succession in New Mexico and Related Will Problems,\" see 7 Nat.
