      "text": "A. Perjury consists of making a false statement under oath, affirmation or penalty of perjury, material to the issue or matter involved in the course of any judicial, administrative, legislative or other official proceeding or matter, knowing such statement to be untrue.\n\nB. Whoever commits perjury is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-25-1, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 25-1; 2009, ch. 78, § 9.\n\nCross references.— For provision making false swearing to accounts by county officers perjury,see4-44-32 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor perjury in land contest proceedings,see19-7-66 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor bribery of witness,see30-24-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor perjury concerning regulated oil and gas wells,see70-2-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection A, after \"affirmation\", added \"or penalty of perjury\" and after \"official proceeding\" added \"or matter\".\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nEssential elements of perjuryare that the testimony of the defendant in the prior case was false testimony under oath made on a material matter with knowledge that it was false.State v. Naranjo, 1979-NMCA-150, 94 N.M. 413, 611 P.2d 1107,rev'd on other grounds, 1980-NMSC-061, 94 N.M. 407, 611 P.2d 1101.\n\nMateriality essential element of perjury.— Under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States constitution, a defendant is entitled to have the question of materiality submitted to the jury, andState v. Albin, 1986-NMCA-046, 104 N.M. 315, 720 P.2d 1256, andState v. Gallegos, 1982-NMCA-062, 98 N.M. 31, 644 P.2d 545, are overruled to the extent they hold that materiality is an element for the trial court to decide as a matter of law.State v. Benavidez, 1999-NMCA-053, 127 N.M. 189, 979 P.2d 234,aff'd in pertinent part, 1999-NMSC-041, 128 N.M. 261, 992 P.2d 274.\n\n\"Willfulness\" not required.— \"Willfulness\" as an aspect distinct from \"knowledge\" is not a part of the offense established by the statute and the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct on \"willfulness.\"State v. Borunda, 1972-NMCA-018, 83 N.M. 563, 494 P.2d 976, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 562, 494 P.2d 975.\n\nRule for proving perjury.— In prosecution for perjury, it is necessary to prove the falsity of defendant's sworn statements beyond a reasonable doubt. This may be done by the testimony of one witness supported by corroborating evidence or circumstances, but the corroboration must go beyond slight or indifferent particulars; it must strongly support the accusing witness.State v. Borunda, 1972-NMCA-018, 83 N.M. 563, 494 P.2d 976, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 562, 494 P.2d 975;Territory v. Remuzon, 1886-NMSC-019, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 648, 9 P. 598,overruled on other grounds byTerritory v. Lockhart, 1896-NMSC-014, 8 N.M. 523, 45 P. 1106;Territory v. Williams, 1898-NMSC-015, 9 N.M. 400, 54 P. 232;State v. Naranjo, 1980-NMSC-061, 94 N.M. 407, 611 P.2d 1101.\n\nReason for special rule.— Justification for special rule in perjury cases is that it is not unreasonable that a conviction for perjury ought not to rest entirely upon an oath against an oath.State v. Borunda, 1972-NMCA-018, 83 N.M. 563, 494 P.2d 976, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 562, 494 P.2d 975.\n\nRequirements of proof in perjury caseare strictest in law, outside of treason charges.State v. Naranjo, 1979-NMCA-150, 94 N.M. 413, 611 P.2d 1107,rev'd on other grounds, 1980-NMSC-061, 94 N.M. 407, 611 P.2d 1101.\n\nPresumption of truth under oath until dispelled.— In a perjury prosecution, the state must begin with the fact that an accused is clothed with a presumption that one will tell the truth when under oath and that, until this presumption is dispelled, one did tell the truth under oath: if the state does not prove the falsity of the statement under oath, the presumption must prevail that he did tell the truth.State v. Naranjo, 1979-NMCA-150, 94 N.M. 413, 611 P.2d 1107,rev'd on other grounds, 1980-NMSC-061, 94 N.M. 407, 611 P.2d 1101.\n\nKnowledge inferred.— The jury could have inferred that defendant knew his testimony to be false when he gave it through reasoning that an ordinary person under similar circumstances testifying as to a specific date and time as defendant did should have known that his testimony was not true.State v. Montoya, 1966-NMSC-224, 77 N.M. 129, 419 P.2d 970.\n\nPerjury before grand jury.— Penalty provided by former 40-32-1, 1953 Comp., for perjury \"committed in any other case\" applied to a conviction under former 40-32-2, 1953 Comp., for perjury before the grand jury.State v. Reed, 1957-NMSC-009, 62 N.M. 147, 306 P.2d 640, distinguished inState v. Borunda, 1972-NMCA-018, 83 N.M. 563, 494 P.2d 976, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 562, 494 P.2d 975 (decided under prior law).\n\nFalse value given property.— A surety who swore falsely as to value of his property was guilty of perjury.Territory v. Weller, 1883-NMSC-004, 2 N.M. 470.\n\nStatements at variance with previous unsworn statements.— The state is not entitled to a conviction for perjury merely on proof that statements under oath were at variance with previous unsworn statements.State v. Naranjo, 1979-NMCA-150, 94 N.M. 413, 611 P.2d 1107,rev'd on other grounds, 1980-NMSC-061, 94 N.M. 407, 611 P.2d 1101.\n\nEvidence was sufficient to find that defendant testified falselywhen he claimed in a prior homicide trial that he, and not the defendant therein, had committed the murder, where along with direct evidence to that effect, the testimony of four witnesses placed the other man at the scene of the crime, one of whom saw gun in his hand.State v. Borunda, 1972-NMCA-018, 83 N.M. 563, 494 P.2d 976, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 562, 494 P.2d 975.\n\nEvidence establishing that defendant made false statements when he testified that the false testimony of another was correct was sufficient for conviction.State v. Benavidez, 1999-NMCA-053, 127 N.M. 189, 979 P.2d 234,aff'd in pertinent part, 1999-NMSC-041, 128 N.M. 261, 992 P.2d 274.\n\nAllegations of charge must be direct and specific.— Before a charge of perjury can be sustained, the allegations must be direct and specific, the indictment must particularize where the testimony was false, a general allegation of falsity being insufficient, and, if the offense encompasses many allegedly perjurious statements, the defendant must be told in the indictment where and to what extent the statements alleged to have been made by him were false.State v. Naranjo, 1980-NMSC-061, 94 N.M. 407, 611 P.2d 1101.\n\nEvidence admissible.— On trial for perjury for false swearing in a prosecution for adultery, defendant's admissions of marriage were admissible.United States v. Chaves, 1891-NMSC-027, 6 N.M. 180, 27 P. 489;United States v. de Amador, 1891-NMSC-025, 6 N.M. 173, 27 P. 488;United States v. de Lujan, 1891-NMSC-026, 6 N.M. 179, 27 P. 489.\n\nPerjury as basis for post-conviction relief.— Defendant's contention that he was convicted on the basis of perjured testimony given by an informer was not supported with the requisite showing of a factual basis for the claim, and hence his motion for post-conviction relief was properly denied without a hearing.Nieto v. State, 1968-NMCA-045, 79 N.M. 330, 443 P.2d 500.\n\nII. MATERIALITY.\n\n\"Material\" construed.— The false testimony giving rise to a charge of perjury in a grand jury investigation does not actually have to impede or influence the investigation to be material; rather the false testimony is material if it has the capacity or tendency to influence or impede the investigation.State v. Watkins, 1979-NMCA-003, 92 N.M. 470, 590 P.2d 169.\n\nMateriality of testimony.— False testimony is material if it has the capacity or tendency to influence the decision of the tribunal or the inquiring or investigative body, or to impede the proceeding, with respect to matters which such tribunal is competent to consider.State v. Gallegos, 1982-NMCA-062, 98 N.M. 31, 644 P.2d 545, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794,overruled on other grounds byState v. Benavidez, 1999-NMCA-053, 127 N.M. 189, 979 P.2d 234.\n\nA lie removing a murder suspect from the scene of the murder has the capacity or tendency to impede the administration of justice.State v. Gallegos, 1982-NMCA-062, 98 N.M. 31, 644 P.2d 545, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794,overruled on other grounds byState v. Benavidez, 1999-NMCA-053, 127 N.M. 189, 979 P.2d 234.\n\nQuestion of law.— Materiality is a question of law to be decided by the trial court.State v. Gallegos, 1982-NMCA-062, 98 N.M. 31, 644 P.2d 545, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794,overruled on other grounds byState v. Benavidez, 1999-NMCA-053, 127 N.M. 189, 979 P.2d 234.\n\nTestimony held material.— False testimony given by defendant in larceny proceedings, which was designed to establish an alibi, was material to the issues involved in the larceny case and therefore constituted perjury.State v. Montoya, 1966-NMSC-224, 77 N.M. 129, 419 P.2d 970.\n\nAverment of materiality.— Where the indictment fully set forth the question averred to be material, in relation to which the testimony was given, it was sufficient in this respect.Territory v. Lockhart, 1896-NMSC-014, 8 N.M. 523, 45 P. 1106.\n\nEvidentiary basis for determining materiality.— In order for the trial court to make a determination of materiality as a matter of law of an allegedly perjured statement, all that is needed, by way of evidentiary support, is the text of the statement and knowledge of the principal issue in the judicial proceeding in which the statement was made.State v. Albin, 1986-NMCA-046, 104 N.M. 315, 720 P.2d 1256, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 246, 719 P.2d 1267,overruled byState v. Benavidez, 1999-NMCA-53, 127 N.M. 189, 979 P.2d 234.\n\nSince materiality is properly determinable as an issue of law, there cannot appropriately be any evidentiary or factual burden.State v. Albin, 1986-NMCA-046, 104 N.M. 315, 720 P.2d 1256, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 246, 719 P.2d 1267,overruled byState v. Benavidez, 1999-NMCA-53, 127 N.M. 189, 979 P.2d 234.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Lawyers, Linguists, Story-Tellers, and Limited English-Speaking Witnesses,\" see 27 N.M.L. Rev. 77 (1997).\n\nAm.
