      "text": "A. Criminal trespass consists of knowingly entering or remaining upon posted private property without possessing written permission from the owner or person in control of the land. The provisions of this subsection do not apply if:\n\n(1) the owner or person in control of the land has entered into an agreement with the department of game and fish granting access to the land to the general public for the purpose of taking any game animals, birds or fish by hunting or fishing; or\n\n(2) a person is in possession of a landowner license given to him by the owner or person in control of the land that grants access to that particular private land for the purpose of taking any game animals, birds or fish by hunting or fishing.\n\nB. Criminal trespass also consists of knowingly entering or remaining upon the unposted lands of another knowing that such consent to enter or remain is denied or withdrawn by the owner or occupant thereof. Notice of no consent to enter shall be deemed sufficient notice to the public and evidence to the courts, by the posting of the property at all vehicular access entry ways.\n\nC. Criminal trespass also consists of knowingly entering or remaining upon lands owned, operated or controlled by the state or any of its political subdivisions knowing that consent to enter or remain is denied or withdrawn by the custodian thereof.\n\nD. Any person who enters upon the lands of another without prior permission and injures, damages or destroys any part of the realty or its improvements, including buildings, structures, trees, shrubs or other natural features, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and he shall be liable to the owner, lessee or person in lawful possession for civil damages in an amount equal to double the value of the damage to the property injured or destroyed.\n\nE. Whoever commits criminal trespass is guilty of a misdemeanor. Additionally, any person who violates the provisions of Subsection A, B or C of this section, when in connection with hunting, fishing or trapping activity, shall have his hunting or fishing license revoked by the state game commission for a period of not less than three years, pursuant to the provisions of Section 17-3-34 NMSA 1978.\n\nF. Whoever knowingly removes, tampers with or destroys any \"no trespass\" sign is guilty of a petty misdemeanor; except when the damage to the sign amounts to more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), he or she is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to imprisonment in the county jail for a definite term less than one year or a fine not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or to both such imprisonment and fine in the discretion of the judge.\n\nG. This section, as amended, shall be published in all issues of \"Big Game Hunt Proclamation\" as published by the department of game and fish.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-14-1, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 14-1; 1975, ch. 52, § 1; 1979, ch. 186, § 1; 1981, ch. 34, § 1; 1983, ch. 27, § 2; 1991, ch. 58, § 1; 1995, ch. 164, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For authority of conservation officers to enforce these provisions under emergency circumstances,see17-2-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor trespass on state lands,see19-6-3 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor criminal damage to property,see30-15-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor detention or arrest of trespassers upon restricted areas,see30-21-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor removal or destruction of plants near highway,see76-8-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor livestock trespass,see77-14-3 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 1, 1995, added the second sentence in Subsection B and added Subsections F and G.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective July 1, 1991, added Subsection A; redesignated the subsequent subsections accordingly; in Subsection B inserted \"also\" and \"unposted\"; in Subsection D added the language beginning with \"and he shall be liable\"; and added the second sentence in Subsection E.\n\nThe 1983 amendmentdeleted \"petty\" preceding \"misdemeanor\" in Subsections C and D.\n\nCrime defined.— Trespassing, both at common law and by statute, is the entry onto another's property without permission of the owner.State v. Tower, 2002-NMCA-109, 133 N.M. 32, 59 P.3d 1264.\n\nUnauthorized entry.— Where an unauthorized entry merely consists of climbing over a fence, businesses and other open property are protected under the criminal trespass statute.State v. Foulenfont, 1995-NMCA-028, 119 N.M. 788, 895 P.2d 1329.\n\nElements of offense.— For a conviction, Section 30-14-1D NMSA 1978 requires that the defendant both \"entered\" property \"without permission\" and \"damaged\" an improvement on the property.State v. Contreras, 2007-NMCA-119, 142 N.M. 518, 167 P.3d 966.\n\nInstruction on lesser included offense.— When criminal trespass is factually based solely on unlawful entry, not on unlawfully remaining without consent, then criminal trespass is necessarily included within the offense of aggravated burglary of a dwelling house and a defendant is entitled to an instruction on the lesser included offense.State v. Romero, 1998-NMCA-057, 125 N.M. 161, 958 P.2d 119,\n\nKnowledge requirement.— While criminal trespass can, under some circumstances, require knowledge that the trespasser does not have permission to be on the land, New Mexico law also defines other trespass-type offenses that require knowledge only of the trespasser's actions, not of their illegality.Tanberg v. Shlotis, 401 F.3d 1151 (10th Cir. 2005).\n\nPrivate land not properly posted.— If private land is not properly posted under the statutory requirements, then a person can only commit criminal trespass by entering or remaining upon the property knowing that such consent to enter or remain is denied or withdrawn by the owner or occupant thereof.State v. Merhege, 2017-NMSC-016,rev'g2016-NMCA-059, 376 P.3d 867.\n\nProof of knowledge element of criminal trespass.— Where defendant was charged with criminal trespass for running through the front yard of a private residence that was enclosed by a three foot high wall and for attempting to jump over an adjoining fence into the back yard of the residence while fleeing from a police officer at 3:40 a.m., there was sufficient circumstantial evidence for the jury to find that defendant knew that he did not have consent to enter the property based on the wall surrounding the property's front yard, the purpose of defendant's entry, and the time of his entry on the property.State v. Merhege, 2017-NMSC-016,rev'g2016-NMCA-059, 376 P.3d 867.\n\nKnowledge of lack of consent to enter land required.— In defendant's trial for criminal trespass, there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction where the private land did not have a \"no trespassing\" sign, and the landowner did not place defendant on notice that he was not permitted on his property by denying or withdrawing consent to enter his land.State v. Merhege, 2016-NMCA-059, cert. granted.\n\nUniform jury instruction does not accurately describe the mens rea for criminal trespass.— Where defendant was charged with breaking and entering, attempt to commit breaking and entering, criminal trespass, and resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer, and where, at trial, the jury was instructed that in order to find defendant guilty of criminal trespass, they must find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendantknew or should have knownthat permission to enter the land had been denied, in accordance with UJI 14-402 NMRA; § 30-14-1(B) NMSA 1978, however, requires a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant \"knowinglyentered or remained upon the unposted lands of anotherknowingthat such consent to enter or remain was denied or withdrawn by the owner or occupant thereof.\" The \"should have known\" language in the instruction adds civil negligence as an alternative to the statute's requirement of actual knowledge, and thus allows a jury to improperly convict based on its belief that a reasonable person would have understood that access was barred. New Mexico law requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of actual knowledge that permission to enter the land had been denied.State v. Ancira, 2022-NMCA-053, cert. denied.\n\nThis section requires general criminal intent.State v. McCormack, 1984-NMCA-042, 101 N.M. 349, 682 P.2d 742.\n\nWhen one commits burglaryof dwelling house one commits criminal trespass based on that entry.State v. Ruiz, 1980-NMCA-123, 94 N.M. 771, 617 P.2d 160.\n\nUnlawfully entering lands of another.— The only \"act\" involved in criminal trespass, as a lesser offense included within burglary of a dwelling house, is entry upon the lands of another, which requires a \"malicious intent.\"State v. Ruiz, 1980-NMCA-123, 94 N.M. 771, 617 P.2d 160 (decided under prior law).\n\nUnlawful entry is entry not authorized by law,without excuse or justification.State v. Ruiz, 1980-NMCA-123, 94 N.M. 771, 617 P.2d 160.\n\n\"Lands,\" in Subsection B,includes buildings and fixtures and is synonymous with real property.State v. Ruiz, 1980-NMCA-123, 94 N.M. 771, 617 P.2d 160.\n\nSubsection B applies to federal government land.— Where land is owned and operated by the federal government as a proprietor, the state has sovereignty over the land, provided it does not interfere with the use of the federal government, and Subsection A applies.State v. McCormack, 1984-NMSC-006, 100 N.M. 657, 674 P.2d 1117.\n\nDamage to property not required to show malicious intent.— While damage to property would be evidence of malicious intent, such is not required inasmuch as malicious intent may be established by evidence of an intent to vex or annoy or do a wrongful act.State v. Ruiz, 1980-NMCA-123, 94 N.M. 771, 617 P.2d 160 (decided under prior law).\n\nTrespass in watermelon patch.— Trespass of group of boys on land occupied by another and stealing of watermelons thereon, with minor injury to fence, did not constitute a violation of former 40-47-12, 1953 Comp., relating to unlawful injury of fence and crops, a felony, but rather, of former 40-47-5, 1953 Comp., relating to trespassing on improved land with intent to cut, take, etc., trees or crops growing there, a misdemeanor.Brown v. Martinez, 1961-NMSC-040, 68 N.M. 271, 361 P.2d 152.\n\nInjuring house.— An opening of four inches was sufficient to complete the offense of injuring house for purpose of entering and molesting occupant under Laws 1875-1876, ch. 9, § 2, former 40-47-19, 1953 Comp.Territory v. Gallegos, 1913-NMSC-002, 17 N.M. 409, 130 P. 245 (decided under prior law).\n\nCivil liability to injured trespasser.— As a matter of law the use of a gun by owner while stopping trespass or theft of watermelons by group of boys was not permissible, and when owner fired gun he became liable to injured boy.Brown v. Martinez, 1961-NMSC-040, 68 N.M. 271, 361 P.2d 152 (decided under prior law).\n\nApplication to journalist not abridgement of rights.— Application of this section to a journalist who crossed a barricade at a federal government nuclear waste disposal plant did not abridge the first amendment right to peaceably assemble or the right of the press to gather and report news.State v. McCormack, 1984-NMCA-042, 101 N.M. 349, 682 P.2d 742.\n\nCriminal trespass not a lesser included offense of breaking and entering.— Trial court did not err in refusing to give lesser included-offense instructions on criminal trespass and breaking and entering.State v. Andrade, 1998-NMCA-031, 124 N.M. 690, 954 P.2d 755, cert. denied, 124 N.M. 589, 953 P.2d 1087.\n\nEvidence sufficient.— Evidence that defendant repeatedly trespassed onto victim's property and that defendant was the party who looked into victim's windows and followed her was sufficient to support convictions for stalking, harassment and criminal trespass.State v. Duran, 1998-NMCA-153, 126 N.M. 60, 966 P.2d 768, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 533, 972 P.2d 352,overruled on other grounds byState v. Laguna, 1999-NMCA-152, 128 N.M. 345, 992 P.2d 896, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 149, 990 P.2d 823.\n\nInsufficient evidence of criminal trespass.— Where defendant was charged with criminal trespass after he was seen by an officer jumping over a fence surrounding a residence, but where, at trial, the state failed to present any evidence to the jury as to the specific location where the trespass allegedly occurred, there was insufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the crime charged.State v. Fierro, 2024-NMCA-016.\n\nAccess to public waters.— A private landowner cannot prevent persons from fishing in a public stream that flows across the landowner's property, provided the public stream is accessible without trespass across privately owned adjacent lands. 2014 Op. Att'y Gen. 14-04.\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico criminal law, see 16 N.M.L. Rev. 9 (1986).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 75 Am.

Any person who enters upon the lands of another when such lands are posted against trespass at every roadway or apparent way of access is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nC. Any person who drives a vehicle upon the lands of another except through a roadway or other apparent way of access, when such lands are fenced in any manner, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nD. In the event any person enters upon the lands of another without prior permission and injures, damages or destroys any part of the realty or its improvements, including buildings, structures, trees, shrubs or other natural features, he shall be liable to the owner, lessee or person in lawful possession for damages in an amount equal to double the amount of the appraised value of the damage of the property injured or destroyed.\n\nHistory:Laws 1979, ch. 186, § 2; 1983, ch. 27, § 3.\n\nThe 1983 amendmentdeleted \"petty\" preceding \"misdemeanor\" in Subsections A to C.\n\nSurface lessee of land had no standing to sue for trespass and unjust enrichment.— Where plaintiff leased land for purposes of ranching and defendants pumped salt water from beyond the boundaries of the land into a disposal well on the land without the knowledge or consent of plaintiff, plaintiff did not have standing to sue defendants for trespass or unjust enrichment.McNeill v. Rice Eng. & Operating, Inc., 2010-NMSC-015, 148 N.M. 16, 229 P.3d 489.\n\nOwner of land had no standing to sue for trespass for use of land prior to owner's acquisition of the land.— Where defendants pumped salt water from beyond the boundaries of plaintiff's land into a disposal well on plaintiff's land without the knowledge or consent of plaintiff or plaintiff's predecessor in interest, plaintiff did not have standing to sue defendants for trespass for acts that occurred prior to the time plaintiff owned the land.McNeill v. Rice Eng. & Operating, Inc., 2010-NMSC-015, 148 N.M. 16, 229 P.3d 489.\n\nNoneconomic damages are available in trespass and private nuisance actions.— Trespass is a direct infringement of another's right of possession, and private nuisance, which is akin to trespass, is an in personam action for tortious interference with one's use and enjoyment of land.

Wrongful use of public property consists of:\n\n(1) knowingly entering any public property without permission of the lawful custodian or his representative when the public property is not open to the public;\n\n(2) remaining in or occupying any public property after having been requested to leave by the lawful custodian, or his representative, who has determined that the public property is being used or occupied contrary to its intended or customary use or that the public property may be damaged or destroyed by the use; or\n\n(3) depriving the general public of the intended or customary use of public property without a permit.\n\nB. Permits to occupy or use public property may be obtained from the lawful custodian or his representative upon written application which:\n\n(1) describes the public property to be occupied or used; and\n\n(2) states the period of time during which the public property will be occupied or used. The applicant shall pay in advance a reasonable fee or charge for the use of the public property. The fee or charge shall be prescribed by the lawful custodian or his representative.\n\nC.

Whoever commits breaking and entering is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nHistory:Laws 1981, ch. 34, § 2.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where defendant attempted to force entry into an apartment through the front door; the occupants of the apartment struggled to hold the door closed; and defendant pushed the occupants back into the apartment about a foot and stepped into the apartment, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of breaking and entering.State v. Sorrelhorse, 2011-NMCA-095, 150 N.M. 536, 263 P.3d 313, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-008, 268 P.3d 513.\n\nSufficient evidence of \"unauthorized entry\".— An \"entry\", for purposes of the breaking and entering statute, occurs whenever there is an invasion into an enclosed, private, prohibited space. To determine the boundaries of enclosures, the proper question is whether the nature of a structure's composition is such that a reasonable person would expect some protection from unauthorized intrusions.State v. Holt, 2016-NMSC-011,aff'g2015-NMCA-073, 352 P.3d 702.\n\nWhere the evidence established that defendant placed his fingers behind a window screen affixed to a residential dwelling and beyond the boundary created by the window screen, defendant's actions constituted an intrusion into an enclosed, private, prohibited space and constituted an \"entry\" for the purposes of New Mexico's breaking and entering statute. There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for breaking and entering.State v. Holt, 2016-NMSC-011,aff'g2015-NMCA-073, 352 P.3d 702.\n\nSufficient evidence of breaking and entering.— Where defendant was charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of two victims, tampering with evidence and breaking and entering, there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction for breaking and entering where the state presented a witness who testified that she saw defendant break a car window and rummage around inside the car, and where defendant acknowledged breaking into a vehicle, but claimed he entered the vehicle to retrieve his own property from the vehicle. It is immaterial that defendant was breaking in to retrieve his own property, because New Mexico's breaking and entering statute requires no intent to commit a crime upon entering, only the breaking and entering need be shown.State v. Carrillo, 2017-NMSC-023.\n\nSufficient evidence to support breaking and entering conviction.— Where defendant was charged with arson, breaking and entering and violating an order of protection, and where the state presented evidence that defendant had broken into the victim's house through her window on prior occasions, similar to the way the arsonist did on the night of the fire, that defendant's blood was found on a pair of pliers and pruning shears found near the victim's broken window on the night of the fire, tools which the victim did not recognize or notice when she had her window secured earlier that morning, and that defendant had a motive to burn the victim's house down, jealousy following a breakup, there was sufficient evidence for a rational juror to find that defendant broke into the victim's house and set it on fire.State v. Pamphille, 2021-NMCA-002, cert. denied.\n\nIntrusion into the space between a window screen and window is sufficient to warrant a finding of an unauthorized entry for the purposes of the breaking and entering statute.— Where defendant attempted to force entry into a home through a window by removing the window screen from its track, and while holding the screen, defendant's fingers penetrated the area between the window and the screen, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of breaking and entering because the window screen was part of the enclosure around the home, and a reasonable person would expect the window screen to afford some protection from unauthorized intrusions.State v. Holt, 2015-NMCA-073, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-006.\n\nSufficient evidence of breaking and entering.— Where defendant was charged with breaking and entering, attempt to commit breaking and entering, criminal trespass, and resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer, and where, at trial the homeowner testified that he locked his back door, front door, and bathroom window, and that when he returned home, he found defendant asleep in the bathroom, the bathroom window wide open, the window crank that opens the bathroom window broken, the window screen to the window on the floor, and footprints outside the bathroom window, there was sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant broke into the house through the bathroom window without permission.State v. Ancira, 2022-NMCA-053, cert. denied.\n\nCriminal damage to property was a lesser included offense of breaking and entering.— Where defendant attempted to force entry into an apartment through the front door; the occupants of the apartment struggled to hold the door closed; defendant pushed the occupants back into the apartment about a foot and stepped into the apartment; while one occupant of the apartment attempted to call 911, defendant walked away; and when the other occupant opened the door to see which way defendant had gone, defendant returned and began kicking the door, defendant's initial act of trying to force open the door of the apartment and then returning minutes later to kick the door was unitary conduct and defendant's conviction of criminal damage to property, which was a lesser included offense of defendant's conviction of breaking and entering, violated defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy.State v. Sorrelhorse, 2011-NMCA-095, 150 N.M. 536, 263 P.3d 313, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-008, 268 P.3d 513.\n\nNot lesser included offense of aggravated burglary.— Breaking and entering is not a lesser included offense of aggravated burglary because each offense requires an element not included in the other and, by convicting defendant of breaking and entering when he only had notice of an aggravated burglary, the trial court violated his right to notice of the charges against him.State v. Hernandez, 1999-NMCA-105, 127 N.M. 769, 987 P.2d 1156, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 149, 990 P.2d 823.\n\nCriminal trespass not a lesser included offense of breaking and entering.— Trial court did not err in refusing to give lesser included-offense instructions on criminal trespass and breaking and entering.State v. Andrade, 1998-NMCA-031, 124 N.M. 690, 954 P.2d 755, cert. denied, 124 N.M. 589, 953 P.2d 1087.\n\nMistake of fact instruction.— Where defendant was charged with breaking and entering a motel room and the evidence showed that defendant checked into the motel and was assigned room 125, subsequently defendant, who was very intoxicated, was discovered in room 121, in the bathroom, the key card for room 125 was on the ground outside near room 121, and the key card did not have a room number on it, defendant was entitled to an instruction on the defense of mistake of fact.State v. Contreras, 2007-NMSC-119, 142 N.M. 518, 167 P.3d 966.\n\nInstructions.— Even though Subsection A of this section uses the phrase \"unauthorized entry,\" while UJI 14-1410 uses the phrase \"without permission,\" this variation from the strict language of the statute does not, by itself, make the instruction improper.State v. Rubio, 1999-NMCA-018, 126 N.M. 579, 973 P.2d 256.\n\nTrial court's failure to instruct the jury on an \"unauthorized entry\" rather than an \"entry without permission\" was not reversible error where the evidence overwhelmingly supported the conclusion that defendant did not have blanket authority to enter the apartment, or that whatever authority he may have had was freely revocable by the renter.State v. Rubio, 1999-NMCA-018, 126 N.M. 579, 973 P.2d 256.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— Burglary, breaking, or entering of motor vehicle, 72 A.L.R.4th 710.",
