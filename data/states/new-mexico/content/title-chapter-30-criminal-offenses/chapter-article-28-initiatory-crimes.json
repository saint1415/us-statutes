      "text": "Attempt to commit a felony consists of an overt act in furtherance of and with intent to commit a felony and tending but failing to effect its commission.\n\nWhoever commits attempt to commit a felony, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as follows:\n\nA. if the crime attempted is a capital or first degree felony, the person committing such attempt is guilty of a second degree felony;\n\nB. if the crime attempted is a second degree felony, the person committing such attempt is guilty of a third degree felony;\n\nC. if the crime attempted is murder in the second degree, the person committing the attempted murder is guilty of a third degree felony and, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978, the basic sentence of imprisonment is nine years;\n\nD. if the crime attempted is a third degree felony, the person committing such attempt is guilty of a fourth degree felony; and\n\nE. if the crime attempted is a fourth degree felony, the person committing such attempt is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nNo person shall be sentenced for an attempt to commit a misdemeanor.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-28-1, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 28-1; 1978 Comp., § 30-28-1; 2024, ch. 51, § 1.\n\nThe 2024 amendment,effective May 15, 2024, increased the penalty for attempted second-degree murder; and added a new Subsection C and redesignated the succeeding subsections accordingly.\n\nSingle intent crime.— The crime of attempt to commit a felony requires the specific intent to commit the underlying crime.State v. Villa, 2003-NMCA-142, 134 N.M. 679, 82 P.3d 46,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2004-NMSC-031, 136 N.M. 367, 98 P.3d 1017.\n\nLegal adequacy.— If a jury could have found a defendant guilty of attempted second degree murder without determining that he intended to kill his ex-wife, it could have convicted him of an attempt to commit reckless or unintentional second degree murder, a crime that does not exist.State v. Carrasco, 2007-NMCA-152, 143 N.M. 62, 172 P.3d 611, cert. quashed, 2008-NMCERT-011, 145 N.M. 531, 202 P.3d 124.\n\nChild abuse.— There is such a crime as attempt to commit child abuse when the theory of the case is intentional child abuse.State v. Herrera, 2001-NMCA-073, 131 N.M. 22, 33 P.3d 22, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 64, 33 P.3d 284, 182.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where a videotape of a transaction in which the victim's ATM card was inserted into an ATM machine showed that the person using the ATM machine had tattoos on the person's arms, the jury was able to compare stills of the videotape with the tattoos on defendant's arms; and several days after the victim's purse had been stolen, the victim's driver's license was found in defendant's vehicle, and defendant told a police offer that defendant tried to use the victim's ATM card, but the machine ate it, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for attempt to commit unauthorized use of an ATM card of another.State v. Verdugo, 2007-NMCA-095, 142 N.M. 267, 164 P.3d 966, cert. quashed, 2008-NMCERT-001, 150 N.M. 558, 263 P.3d 900.\n\nWhere defendant purchased nine gallons of iodine and possessed over 5,000 pseudoephedrine pills, a quart of acetone, scales, and an air purifier; and most of the pills had been removed from their blister packs, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for attempted trafficking in methamphetamine by manufacturing, even though defendant did not possess all of the materials necessary to manufacture methamphetamine.State v. Brenn, 2005-NMCA-121, 138 N.M. 451, 121 P.3d 1050, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-010, 138 N.M. 494, 122 P.3d 1263.\n\nWhere the evidence showed that defendant purchased thirty-five boxes of matches from several different stores, one right after the other; the matchboxes contained red phosphorous, a key ingredient in the manufacture of methamphetamine; defendant bought the boxes of matches for her sister and turned them over to her sister; defendant knew that the matchboxes were scraped for red phosphorous and that the substance was used in the manufacture of methamphetamine; the matchboxes were going to be used in the manufacture of methamphetamine; and together with her sister, defendant purchased or financed the purchase of Coleman fuel and distilled water, which are ingredients commonly used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, there was substantial evidence to convict defendant of attempted manufacture of methamphetamine.State v. Kent, 2006-NMCA-134, 140 N.M. 606, 145 P.3d 86, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-010, 140 N.M. 674, 146 P.3d 809.\n\nSufficient evidence of attempted second degree murder.— Where the defendant rapidly accelerated his vehicle toward the police officer who had been pursuing him in a high speed chase after the officer got out of his car and the defendant pointed a rifle or a shotgun at the officer after the defendant had already fired three shots at the officer, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the court's finding that the defendant committed attempted second degree murder.State v. Demongey, 2008-NMCA-066, 144 N.M. 333, 187 P.3d 679, cert. quashed, 2011-NMCERT-001, 150 N.M. 558, 263 P.3d 900.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Defendant's convictions for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and attempted murder arising out of unitary conduct did not violate the double jeopardy clause.State v. Armandarez, 2006-NMSC-036, 140 N.M. 182, 141 P.3d 526.\n\nWhere defendant intended to steal the property of only one victim and defendant used separate and discrete acts of force and threats against two victims, defendant's convictions for two counts of attempted armed robbery did not violate the double jeopardy clause.State v. Bernal, 2006-NMSC-050, 140 N.M. 644, 146 P.3d 289.\n\nThe crime of attempted CSP III is subsumed within assault with attempt to commit CSP.State v. Schackow, 2006-NMCA-123, 140 N.M. 506, 143 P.3d 745, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-009, 140 N.M. 542, 144 P.3d 101.\n\nSince defendant was not tried on charge of attempt to commit aggravated battery, which charge was dismissed before any evidence was presented, there was no issue as to double punishment or merged offenses when defendant was tried and convicted of aggravated burglary.State v. Hibbs, 1971-NMCA-100, 82 N.M. 722, 487 P.2d 150.\n\nCrime of attempt to commit a felony (burglary) did not merge with the crime of possession of burglary tools, as the \"overt act\" required in the attempt statute did not necessarily involve possession of burglary tools; hence defendant's sentence for each crime did not constitute double punishment.State v. Everitt, 1969-NMCA-010, 80 N.M. 41, 450 P.2d 927.\n\nDefendant's right to freedom from double jeopardy was not violated by punishment for attempted first degree murder, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and criminal sexual penetration.State v. Traeger, 2000-NMCA-015,128 N.M. 668, 997 P.2d 142,aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 2001-NMSC-022, 130 N.M. 618, 29 P.3d 518.\n\nConvictions of aggravated battery upon a peace officer and attempted first degree murder violated double jeopardy.— Where defendant, who was imprisoned in a county detention center, attacked and stabbed a correctional officer five times with a metal shank, defendant's convictions for attempted murder and aggravated battery of a peace officer did not violate double jeopardy.State v. Urquizo, 2012-NMCA-113, 288 P.3d 919, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-011.\n\nConvictions of attempted murder and aggravated battery violated double jeopardy.— Where defendant was convicted of attempted murder and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon; defendant's conduct was unitary; the indictment for attempted murder required the state to prove that defendant attempted to commit murder and \"began to do an act which constituted a substantial part of murder\" but failed to commit the offense; the indictment for aggravated battery required the state to prove that defendant touched or applied force to the victims with a deadly weapon intending to injure the victims; the state's theory of the case to support both charges was that defendant beat, stabbed, and slashed the victims; and the state offered the same testimony to prove both charges, the aggravated battery elements were subsumed within the attempted murder elements and defendant's convictions violated the prohibition against double jeopardy.State v. Swick, 2012-NMSC-018, 279 P.3d 747,rev'g2010-NMCA-098, 148 N.M. 895, 242 P.3d 462,overrulingState v. Armendariz, 2006-NMSC-036, 140 N.M. 182, 141 P.3d 526.\n\nStatute is general law, inapplicable if special law covers same matter.— Albuquerque's ordinance making it unlawful for any person under the influence to operate a vehicle is enforceable under and consistent with state law. The fact that the ordinance defines an attempted misdemeanor does not render it invalid under this section, which is a general law not applicable if a special law covers the same matter. Moreover, former 64-15-7, 1953 Comp. (similar to 66-7-8 NMSA 1978), specifically authorized Albuquerque to adopt additional traffic regulations.City of Albuquerque v. Chavez, 1978-NMCA-032, 91 N.M. 559, 577 P.2d 457, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 610, 577 P.2d 1256.\n\nOvert act necessary.— To constitute an attempt, defendant must do an overt act in furtherance of and with intent to commit a felony and tending but failing to effect its commission.State v. Lopez, 1969-NMCA-115, 81 N.M. 107, 464 P.2d 23, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 140, 464 P.2d 559,overruled on other grounds byState v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nAn attempt has been accomplished when an overt act, in furtherance of and tending to effect the commission of the felony, has been performed or undertaken with intent to commit the felony.State v. Flowers, 1971-NMSC-091, 83 N.M. 113, 489 P.2d 178).\n\nAttempted murder does not requirethat victim be injured.State v. Gillette, 1985-NMCA-037, 102 N.M. 695, 699 P.2d 626.\n\nOvert act described.— Overt act required hereunder must be more than preparation; it must be in part execution of the intent to commit the crime, and slight acts in furtherance of that intent will constitute an attempt.State v. Trejo, 1972-NMCA-019, 83 N.M. 511, 494 P.2d 173;State v. Stettheimer, 1980-NMCA-023, 94 N.M. 149, 607 P.2d 1167.\n\nPurpose and effort involved.— The word \"attempt\" was more comprehensive than the word \"intent,\" implying both the purpose and the actual effort to carry that purpose into execution.State v. Grayson, 1946-NMSC-025, 50 N.M. 147, 172 P.2d 1019.\n\nNature of attempted act.— If the intended act is not criminal there can be no criminal liability for an attempt to commit it.State v. Lopez, 1969-NMCA-115, 81 N.M. 107, 464 P.2d 23, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 140, 464 P.2d 559 (1970),overruled on other grounds byState v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nAttempt under this section requires intent to commit felony;therefore, this is a specific intent crime and the statutory language states this requisite intent.State v. Dosier, 1975-NMCA-031, 88 N.M. 32, 536 P.2d 1088, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 28, 536 P.2d 1084.\n\nSpecific intent required for attempted first degree murder.— Where defendant shot at officers to escape apprehension during prison break, there was insufficient evidence that defendant had formed a specfic intent to kill as opposed to mere impulsive reactions; there was, therefore, insufficient evidence to convict him for attempted first degree murder.State v. Hernandez, 1998-NMCA-167, 126 N.M. 377, 970 P.2d 149, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 533, 972 P.2d 352.\n\nSufficient evidence of unlawful transportation of a firearm.— Where defendant was convicted of unlawful transportation of a firearm, and where defendant admitted that he was a felon at the time of the charged offense, and where the state presented evidence at trial that he was driving his accomplice around town and was aware that his accomplice had brought a gun into the car, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that defendant transported a firearm.State v. Torres, 2018-NMSC-013.\n\nSufficient evidence of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder.— Where defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder, and where the state presented evidence at trial that defendant spent the day before the murder with another man who had a motive to kill the victim, that defendant secured for himself and the other man a ride to the apartment complex where the victim lived, that defendant and the other man disappeared from sight before gunshots were heard, that defendant and the other man were seen running back to their vehicle before driving off, and that occupants of the vehicle testified that defendant smelled like burnt matches, which is similar to the smell of gunpowder, there was sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that defendant had the deliberate intent to kill the victim, that he helped in the planning of the crime, and that he actively participated in the actual attempt to kill the victim.State v. Torres, 2018-NMSC-013.\n\nIntent must be corroborated by objective facts.— To convict a defendant of an attempt, the required criminal intent must be sufficiently corroborated by objective facts. Such corroboration is required to prevent conviction on the basis of criminal intent alone.State v. Lopez, 1983-NMSC-069, 100 N.M. 291, 669 P.2d 1086.\n\nInstruction on intent essential.— Since specific intent to murder was gist of crime of attempt to commit murder under Laws 1853-1854, p. 92 (former 40-6-10, 1953 Comp.), refusal to instruct on question of intent constituted error.State v. Grayson, 1946-NMSC-025, 50 N.M. 147, 172 P.2d 1019.\n\nIntent instruction.— The crime of attempted sodomy (now criminal sexual penetration, Section 30-9-11 NMSA 1978) was a specific intent crime, and where there were no instructions regarding the element of specific intent, conviction would be reversed.State v. Foster, 1974-NMCA-150, 87 N.M. 155, 530 P.2d 949.\n\nFactual impossibility not defense.— A defense of impossibility is not available to a defendant charged with an attempt to traffic in a controlled substance, i.e., cocaine, where the defendant received money for what he represented as cocaine, but which due to a circumstance unknown to him, in fact was not.State v. Lopez, 1983-NMSC-069, 100 N.M. 291, 669 P.2d 1086.\n\nSection does not apply to attempts regarding controlled substances.— The legislature intended to punish attempts regarding controlled substances under 30-31-25A(3) NMSA 1978 specifically as felonies and consequently, this section does not apply to such attempts covered by 30-31-25A(3) NMSA 1978.State v. Mirabal, 1989-NMCA-057, 108 N.M. 749, 779 P.2d 126, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 713, 778 P.2d 911.\n\n\"Attempt\" inconsistent with completed crime.— For an attempt under this section, the perpetrator must have failed to effect commission of the crime, and if the evidence is of the completed crime, then the crime of \"attempt\" is not involved.State v. Andrada, 1971-NMCA-033, 82 N.M. 543, 484 P.2d 763, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 534, 484 P.2d 754.\n\nEvidence of completed crime.— An attempt to commit a felony is an act done with intent to commit such crime but which fails of completion.State v. Lopez, 1969-NMCA-115, 81 N.M. 107, 464 P.2d 23, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 140, 464 P.2d 559 (1970),overruled on other grounds byState v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nTo instruct on an \"attempt\" where there is no evidence tending to establish failure to complete the crime would present a false issue to the jury.State v. Andrada, 1971-NMCA-033, 82 N.M. 543, 484 P.2d 763, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 534, 484 P.2d 754.\n\nAttempted burglary.— The jury, after it had found that the defendant shattered grocery store window, validly inferred that the window was broken in an attempt to enter and unlawfully take property from inside the store.State v. Serrano, 1964-NMSC-161, 74 N.M. 412, 394 P.2d 262.\n\nAttempted forgery.— It is possible to have a physical act which is an attempt to transfer one's interest in forged item but to have such an attempt thwarted at some stage of perpetration.State v. Tooke, 1970-NMCA-068, 81 N.M. 618, 471 P.2d 188,overruled on other grounds byState v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nEvidence that defendant represented himself as being person named as payee of check, and presented identification to this effect, supported conviction for attempted forgery, regardless of fact that state did not undertake to prove that the checks if presented to drawee bank would not have been paid, or that defendant did not have the right to use the payee's name.State v. Lopez, 1969-NMCA-115, 81 N.M. 107, 464 P.2d 23, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 140, 464 P.2d 559 (1970),overruled on other grounds byState v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nAttempted trafficking in cocaine.— Defendant failed to effect the crime of possession with intent to distribute because he never actually possessed the package containing cocaine which was addressed to him; nevertheless, the fact that he never actually possessed the package did not negate his intent to possess the package, as evidenced by his attempting to pick up the package, nor did it negate his intent to distribute the cocaine, as is evidenced by the amount of cocaine found in the package. Therefore, he was properly convicted of attempted trafficking under this section and 30-31-20A(3).State v. Curry, 1988-NMCA-031, 107 N.M. 133, 753 P.2d 1321, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 132, 753 P.2d 1320.\n\nDefendant was properly convicted for attempted trafficking in cocaine since he committed the overt acts of accepting a sizeable amount of cash from an undercover narcotics officer and engaging in prior discussion of the illicit transaction.State v. Green, 1993-NMSC-056, 116 N.M. 273, 861 P.2d 954.\n\nAttempted sodomy.— Defendant's beating of minor, partially stripping him and straddling him with his fly open constituted active efforts to consummate the crime of sodomy (now criminal sexual penetration) and were more than mere preparation.State v. Trejo, 1972-NMCA-019, 83 N.M. 511, 494 P.2d 173.\n\nMurder during attempt to commit felony.— Felony-murder provision is applicable once conduct in furtherance of the commission of a felony has progressed sufficiently to constitute an attempt to commit the felony.State v. Flowers, 1971-NMSC-091, 83 N.M. 113, 489 P.2d 178.\n\nThere was ample evidence to support a finding that defendant had accomplished an attempt to unlawfully take decedent's automobile before the bullet struck decedent in the head, and that defendant, at the time he killed decedent, was in the act of committing at least this felony.State v. Flowers, 1971-NMSC-091, 83 N.M. 113, 489 P.2d 178.\n\nTransferred intent applicable to attempted murder.— The doctrine of transferred intent applies to both murder and attempted murder.State v. Gillette, 1985-NMCA-037, 102 N.M. 695, 699 P.2d 626.\n\nMultiple counts proper where there are multiple victims.— The single violent act of firebombing a residence with six people inside gives rise to six counts of attempted second degree murder.State v. Johnson, 1985-NMCA-074, 103 N.M. 364, 707 P.2d 1174, cert. quashed, 103 N.M. 344, 707 P.2d 552.\n\nNo such crime as attempted \"depraved mind\" murder.— The crime of attempted \"depraved mind\" murder does not exist since in order to convict for such an offense, the jury would have to find that the defendant intended to perpetrate an unintentional killing, a logical impossibility.State v. Johnson, 1985-NMCA-074, 103 N.M. 364, 707 P.2d 1174, cert. quashed, 103 N.M. 344, 707 P.2d 552.\n\nAttempted second degree murder of unintended victims.— If defendant committed an act, intending to kill someone but knowing that his act created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to others, he is guilty of attempted second degree murder as to the others.State v. Johnson, 1985-NMCA-074, 103 N.M. 364, 707 P.2d 1174, cert. quashed, 103 N.M. 344, 707 P.2d 552.\n\nInformation adequate.— Information charging defendant with attempting to break and enter a certain grocery in the nighttime with intent to take property therefrom, alleged a felony offense, and since under the applicable statutory sections, theft of property of any value would have been a felony, value need not have been specified in the information.State v. Serrano, 1964-NMSC-161, 74 N.M. 412, 394 P.2d 262.\n\nInformation insufficient.— An information that merely stated that crime was committed by assault failed to charge an attempt to commit the crime of murder by poisoning, drowning or strangling contemplated under Laws 1854-1855, p. 92 (former 40-6-10, 1953 Comp.).State v. Grayson, 1946-NMSC-025, 50 N.M. 147, 172 P.2d 1019 (decided under prior law).\n\nCircumstantial evidence.— A conviction of poisoning with intent to kill or injure under Laws 1854-1855, p. 94 (former 40-6-11, 1953 Comp.) could be had on circumstantial evidence.State v. Holden, 1941-NMSC-017, 45 N.M. 147, 113 P.2d 171.\n\nInadmissible hearsay.— In prosecution for murder and attempted murder admission of extra-judicial statements attributed to children of victims was error where the children were not called as witnesses because defendant was denied his constitutional right of confrontation, being deprived of opportunity to cross-examine.State v. Lunn, 1971-NMCA-048, 82 N.M. 526, 484 P.2d 368.\n\nInstruction on abandoned intent not warranted.— Where defendant was charged with aiding and abetting in an attempted rape, and the evidence was uncontradicted that codefendant ripped off victim's shirt and attempted to take off her pants before he stopped his aggression, that the defendant had been in the automobile prior to this action, and was in close proximity at the time, having left the automobile at the request of codefendant, therefore implicating himself in and giving his tacit consent to codefendant's actions, defendant's requested instruction on abandonment of criminal intent was properly refused.State v. LeMarr, 1971-NMSC-082, 83 N.M. 18, 487 P.2d 1088.\n\nInstruction on attempted rape.— In prosecution under federal act for rape on an Indian reservation, the federal court had jurisdiction to instruct on lesser included offenses under state law, and it was error not to instruct on attempted rape and other lesser offenses for which there was some evidence.Joe v. United States, 510 F.2d 1038 (10th Cir. 1974).\n\nDefendant could not create provocation which would reduceattempted murder to attempted manslaughter, and his requested instruction on attempted voluntary manslaughter was therefore properly refused.State v. Durante, 1986-NMCA-024, 104 N.M. 639, 725 P.2d 839.\n\nInstruction on aggravated battery as lesser included offense.— Where there is no showing that the defendant either intended to scare or intended to injure the victim, but the facts clearly show that the defendant intended to kill the victim, the trial court is correct in rejecting an aggravated battery instruction as a lesser included offense of attempted murder with a firearm.State v. Simonson, 1983-NMSC-075, 100 N.M. 297, 669 P.2d 1092.\n\nIn a prosecution for attempted murder, the trial court properly instructed the jury on aggravated battery as a lesser included offense at the state's request, because the elements of the lesser crime were a subset of the elements of the charged crime and, further, the defendant could not have committed the greater offense in the manner charged in the indictment without also committing the lesser offense.State v. Meadors, 1995-NMSC-073, 121 N.M. 38, 908 P.2d 731.\n\nEvidence sufficient to sustain conviction of attempted fraud.— Because of defendant's intimate knowledge of the workings of the county government he had recently been county manager the jury could properly find that defendant made knowingly false representations. This information coupled with the testimony of two commissioners contradicting defendant's testimony was found sufficient for conviction of attempted fraud.State v. Olguin, 1994-NMCA-050, 118 N.M. 91, 879 P.2d 92,aff'd in part, 1995-NMSC-077, 120 N.M. 740, 906 P.2d 731.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Confusing Law of Criminal Intent in New Mexico,\" see 5 N.M.L.

Whoever commits conspiracy shall be punished as follows:\n\n(1) if the highest crime conspired to be committed is a capital or first degree felony, the person committing such conspiracy is guilty of a second degree felony;\n\n(2) if the highest crime conspired to be committed is a second degree felony, the person committing such conspiracy is guilty of a third degree felony; and\n\n(3) if the highest crime conspired to be committed is a third degree felony or a fourth degree felony, the person committing such conspiracy is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-28-2, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 28-2; 1979, ch. 257, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For compounding a crime,see30-22-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nSearch of rental vehicle.— A passenger in a rental vehicle who is charged with conspiracy and is not on the rental contract does not have standing to challenge a search of the vehicle.State v. Van Dang, 2005-NMSC-033, 138 N.M. 408, 120 P.3d 830.\n\nSection applicable to crimes within and outside of Criminal Code.— This section applies to conspiracies to commit crimes whether they are contained in the Criminal Code or are found elsewhere in the New Mexico statutes,e.g., securities laws.State v. Shafer, 1985-NMCA-018, 102 N.M. 629, 698 P.2d 902, cert. denied, 102 N.M. 613, 698 P.2d 886.\n\nConspiracy to commit depraved-mind murder.— This section does not encompass conspiracy to commit depraved-mind murder.State v. Baca, 1997-NMSC-059, 124 N.M. 333, 950 P.2d 776.\n\nConspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine.— Subsection A of this section does not clearly and unequivocally alert a person to the possibility of prosecution and punishment for conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine. The court was not persuaded that a defendant-seller shares a purchaser's intent to commit a crime merely because the defendant had knowledge of the purchaser's intended use of those goods or services at the time of the sale. In this context, knowledge of the other's criminal objective is not necessarily equivalent to an intention to bring about the objective.State v. Maldonado, 2005-NMCA-072, 137 N.M. 699, 114 P.3d 379, cert. quashed, 2006-NMCERT-001, 139 N.M. 272, 131 P.3d 659.\n\nNumber of criminal conspiracies.— The number of agreements to break the law determines the number of criminal conspiracies subject to prosecution.State v. Sanders, 1994-NMSC-043, 117 N.M. 452, 872 P.2d 870.\n\nConvictions of all conspirators unnecessary.— Although it takes two or more to effect a conspiracy, conviction of all conspirators, or even more than one, is not required and ordinarily, the entry of a nolle prosequi as to other alleged conspirators does not vitiate the conviction of a remaining defendant charged with conspiring with them.State v. Verdugo, 1969-NMSC-008, 79 N.M. 765, 449 P.2d 781.\n\nFact that co-defendant's substantive crimes dismissed not determinative for conspiracy convictions.— There was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have inferred that defendant had agreed with co-defendant, as a sales representative and later as a sales manager of the condominium project, to sell unregistered securities and to engage in sales practices which had the effect of operating as a fraud upon purchasers. The fact that the substantive crimes of fraudulent practices and the sale or offer to sell unregistered securities as to the co-defendant were dismissed by the trial court is not determinative for the conspiracy convictions. The substantive crimes and the crime of conspiracy are different, and involve separate concepts; and failure to convict on one does not prevent a conviction on the other.State v. Shade, 1986-NMCA-072, 104 N.M. 710, 726 P.2d 864, cert. quashed, 104 N.M. 702, 726 P.2d 856,overruled on other grounds byState v. Olguin, 1994-NMCA-050, 118 N.M. 91, 879 P.2d 92,aff'd in part, 1995-NMSC-077, 120 N.M. 740, 906 P.2d 731.\n\nApplicability of Wharton's rule.— Wharton's rule provides that an agreement by two persons to commit a particular crime cannot be prosecuted as a conspiracy when the particular crime is of such a nature as to necessarily require the participation of two persons for its commission. The conduct involved in a conspiracy to commit trafficking under the Controlled Substances Act (Section 30-31-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.) is not like those offenses to which Wharton's rule traditionally applies and therefore the rule's presumption does not apply to such a conspiracy.State v. Carr, 1981-NMCA-029, 95 N.M. 755, 626 P.2d 292, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 669, 625 P.2d 1186, and cert. denied, 454 U.S. 853, 102 S. Ct. 298, 70 L. Ed. 2d 145 (1981),overruled on other grounds byState v. Olguin, 1994-NMCA-050, 118 N.M. 91, 879 P.2d 92,aff'd in part, 1995-NMSC-077, 120 N.M. 740, 906 P.2d 731.\n\nExpansion of Wharton's Rule discouraged.— Where the conspiracy and the substantive offense are the same crime because the concerted action was logically necessary to prove the substantive offense, the multiple punishment, double-description analysis under principles of double jeopardy is the better analysis to be applied, and the future expansion of Wharton's Rule is expressly discouraged.State v. Silvas, 2015-NMSC-006,aff'g2013-NMCA-093, 310 P.3d 621.\n\nTrafficking controlled substances with intent to distribute and conspiracy based on a single act.— Where defendant was convicted of trafficking a controlled substance by possession with intent to distribute in violation of 30-31-20(A) NMSA 1978, and conspiracy to commit the same crime in violation of this section, both charges based on evidence of a single sale of drugs by defendant; the defendant's conduct underlying both crimes was unitary, and the state relied on the same evidence, the single sale of drugs from defendant to the co-conspirator, as the basis to convict for both crimes; the defendant was convicted twice and is being punished twice for the same offense, resulting in a double jeopardy violation.State v. Silvas, 2015-NMSC-006,aff'g2013-NMCA-093, 310 P.3d 621.\n\nWharton's Rule precluded a charge of conspiracy conspiracy to commit trafficking drugs.— Where defendant was convicted for trafficking by possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and for conspiracy to commit trafficking; the trafficking charge was based on a single sale of methamphetamine by defendant and to defendant's co-conspirator; defendant and the co-conspirator were the only parties involved in the transaction; and the conspiracy charge was based on the same conduct as the trafficking charge, Wharton's Rule precluded the charge of conspiracy.State v. Silvas, 2013-NMCA-093, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-009.\n\nConspiracy not barred by incarceration.— Incarceration may prevent active participation in carrying out some of the acts of a conspiracy; it has no effect whatever in dampening initiatory conspiratorial activity.State v. Gilbert, 1982-NMCA-081, 98 N.M. 77, 644 P.2d 1066.\n\nConspiracy not susceptible to firearm enhancement.— Since conspiracy is an initiatory crime which involves no physical act other than communication, it is not conceivable how a firearm could be used in the commission of that offense. Accordingly, the crime of conspiracy is not susceptible to firearm enhancement under § 31-18-16 NMSA 1978.State v. Padilla, 1994-NMCA-067, 118 N.M. 189, 879 P.2d 1208.\n\nDerivative liability.— Defendant, as a conspirator, can be guilty of a substantive offense on a theory of derivative liability.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-126, 90 N.M. 12, 558 P.2d 1151.\n\nAiding and abetting and conspiracy are distinct and separate concepts.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-126, 90 N.M. 12, 558 P.2d 1151.\n\nKnowledge essential to aiding and abetting.— One does not become a party to a conspiracy by aiding and abetting it unless one knows of the conspiracy.State v. Dressel, 1973-NMCA-113, 85 N.M. 450, 513 P.2d 187.\n\nJury question.— When a series of illegal transactions has occurred, the issue of whether there is one conspiracy directed toward several acts or multiple conspiracies is a factual one for the jury.State v. Hernandez, 1986-NMCA-040, 104 N.M. 268, 720 P.2d 303, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 201, 718 P.2d 1349.\n\nSentencing for conspiracy to commit murder.— Conspiracy to commit murder is a felony \"resulting in the death of a human being\" within the meaning of Section 31-18-15A(2) (now Section 31-18-15A(4)) NMSA 1978.State v. Shije, 1998-NMCA-102, 125 N.M. 581, 964 P.2d 142.\n\nConspiracy as basis for post-conviction relief.— Where defendant claimed that an assistant district attorney, a state police officer and two other persons violated this section, that this conspiracy was directed against him and that as a result his conviction, judgment and sentence were illegal, but did not allege in what manner the alleged conspiracy affected him, he failed to state a basis for post-conviction relief.State v. Dominguez, 1969-NMCA-045, 80 N.M. 328, 455 P.2d 194.\n\nUnit of prosecution for conspiracy is an agreement.— The unit of prosecution for conspiracy is the agreement to commit crime, not the criminal objectives of the agreement, that is, the individual crimes that the agreement sets out to accomplish. The legislature established a rebuttable presumption that multiple crimes are the object of only one, overarching, conspiratorial agreement subject to one severe punishment set at the highest crime conspired to commit. The totality of the circumstances test is the mechanism to determine the exceptional instances in which the presumption of singularity may be overcome by demonstrating the existence of more than one conspiracy. The factor considered in the totality of circumstances analysis include whether the location of the conspiracies is the same, whether there is a significant degree of temporal overlap between the conspiracies, whether there is an overlap of personnel between the conspiracies, whether overt acts charged and the role played by the defendant in the conspiracies are similar, whether there was a common goal among the conspirators, and whether the agreement contemplated bringing to pass a continuous result that would not continue without the continuous cooperation of the conspirators.State v. Gallegos, 2011-NMSC-027, 149 N.M. 704, 254 P.3d 655.\n\nII. ELEMENTS OF CONSPIRACY.\n\nConspiracy is definedas a common design or agreement to accomplish an unlawful purpose or a lawful purpose by unlawful means.State v. Chavez, 1983-NMSC-037, 99 N.M. 609, 661 P.2d 887.\n\nOvert act not required.— Section does not require overt act in connection with the conspiracy, as conspiracy in New Mexico is complete when the prohibited agreement is reached.State v. Davis, 1978-NMCA-122, 92 N.M. 341, 587 P.2d 1352, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 353, 588 P.2d 554.\n\nThe overt act which constitutes the object of a conspiracy is no part of the crime of conspiracy; an overt act is not required, but the crime is complete when the felonious agreement is reached.State v. Leyba, 1979-NMCA-105, 93 N.M. 366, 600 P.2d 312;State v. Gilbert, 1982-NMCA-081, 98 N.M. 77, 644 P.2d 1066.\n\nCommon design is essenceof conspiracy.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-126, 90 N.M. 12, 558 P.2d 1151;State v. Farris, 1970-NMCA-067, 81 N.M. 589, 470 P.2d 561.\n\nMutually implied understanding is sufficientso far as combination or confederacy is concerned.State v. Farris, 1970-NMCA-067, 81 N.M. 589, 470 P.2d 561;State v. Davis, 1978-NMCA-122, 92 N.M. 341, 587 P.2d 1352, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 353, 588 P.2d 554.\n\nCommon design or mutually implied understanding.— Conspiracy is defined in terms of a common design or mutually implied understanding.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-125, 90 N.M. 10, 558 P.2d 1149.\n\nFor a conspiracy to exist there must be a common design or a mutually implied understanding; an agreement.State v. Ross, 1974-NMCA-028, 86 N.M. 212, 521 P.2d 1161.\n\nCommon design may be establishedby circumstantial evidence.State v. Davis, 1978-NMCA-122, 92 N.M. 341, 587 P.2d 1352, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 353, 588 P.2d 554.\n\nFormal agreement not necessary.— To establish conspiracy formal agreement need not be proved; a mutually implied understanding is sufficient to establish the conspiracy.State v. Dressel, 1973-NMCA-113, 85 N.M. 450, 513 P.2d 187;State v. Sheets, 1981-NMCA-064, 96 N.M. 75, 628 P.2d 320, cert. quashed, 96 N.M. 116, 628 P.2d 686.\n\nKnowledge of conspiracy necessary.— One cannot be a party to a conspiracy unless one knows of the conspiracy.State v. Sheets, 1981-NMCA-064, 96 N.M. 75, 628 P.2d 320, cert. quashed, 96 N.M. 116, 628 P.2d 686.\n\nMere passive submission or acquiescence of conduct of others insufficient.— To be guilty of conspiracy to shoot from a motor vehicle, there must have been an agreement that one of the parties thereto would shoot a firearm recklessly from the vehicle; the agreement could be explicit or a mutually implied understanding, but mere passive submission or acquiescence in the conduct of others would not suffice.State v. Mariano R., 1997-NMCA-018, 123 N.M. 121, 934 P.2d 315.\n\nIt takes at least two persons to effect a conspiracyas the essence of a conspiracy is a common design or agreement to accomplish an unlawful purpose or a lawful purpose by unlawful means.State v. Dressel, 1973-NMCA-113, 85 N.M. 450, 513 P.2d 187;State v. Sheets, 1981-NMCA-064, 96 N.M. 75, 628 P.2d 320, cert. quashed, 96 N.M. 116, 628 P.2d 686.\n\nConspiracy as single agreement.— Whether the object of a single agreement is to commit one or many crimes, it is in either case that agreement which constitutes the conspiracy which the statute punishes.State v. Ross, 1974-NMCA-028, 86 N.M. 212, 521 P.2d 1161.\n\nMere presence insufficient.— Where there was no evidence that defendant's partner had any knowledge whatsoever of defendant's scheme, even though she was present with him while he was effectuating it, the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for conspiracy.State v. Dressel, 1973-NMCA-113, 85 N.M. 450, 513 P.2d 187.\n\nIII. DOUBLE JEOPARDY.\n\nEntailing single punishment.— The one agreement cannot be taken to be several agreements and hence several conspiracies because it envisages the violation of several statutes rather than one; thus, where there is only one conspiracy and, therefore, only one conspiracy offense, only a single penalty can be validly imposed.State v. Ross, 1974-NMCA-028, 86 N.M. 212, 521 P.2d 1161.\n\nConspiracy and the completed offense are separate offensesand conviction of both does not amount to double jeopardy.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-126, 90 N.M. 12, 558 P.2d 1151.\n\nDouble jeopardy not bar to conspiracy and substantive crime convictions.— Plea of double jeopardy is no defense to convictions for a substantive offense and a conspiracy to commit that offense.State v. Smith, 1985-NMCA-011, 102 N.M. 512, 697 P.2d 512.\n\nConspiracy to commit first-degree murder is a second-degree felony and a fifteen-year term of imprisonment is an appropriate sentence.— Where defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, arson, and tampering with evidence due to his involvement in the murder of a man, and where defendant claimed that his fifteen-year sentence for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder violated double jeopardy and was an unconstitutional sentencing enhancement based on the victim's death, defendant's fifteen year sentence was the proper basic sentence for a second-degree felony that resulted in the death of a human being. The fact that defendant's sentence for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder took into account the factual consequence of the conduct, the victim's death, did not violate double jeopardy and was not an unconstitutional enhancement but rather the appropriate basic sentence for a second-degree felony that resulted in the death of a human being.State v. Chavez, 2021-NMSC-017.\n\nPunishment for both constitutional.— Although defendant had been convicted and was being punished for his conspiracy at the time of his trial, he was not placed in double jeopardy by being convicted and sentenced on the substantive counts.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-126, 90 N.M. 12, 558 P.2d 1151.\n\nConspiracy does not arise out of same transaction as shoplifting.— A charge of conspiracy does not arise out of the same transaction which results in an indictment for shoplifting, and thus cannot be dismissed as in violation of a statute prohibiting the charging of separate or additional offense if it arises out of the same transaction, notwithstanding proof of the subsequent shoplifting may also tend to circumstantially prove the conspiracy charge.State v. Leyba, 1979-NMCA-105, 93 N.M. 366, 600 P.2d 312.\n\nTwo distinct crimes shown.— Evidence that a conspiracy to commit burglary was entered on the evening of November 16th, that the conspirators unsuccessfully attempted to carry out the conspiracy at 10:30 p.m. of that day, and that the burglary was performed between 9:00 and 9:30 a.m. of November 17th, showed two distinct crimes, and there was no factual basis for the contention that they were either the same or so similar that multiple convictions were prohibited.State v. Watkins, 1975-NMCA-126, 88 N.M. 561, 543 P.2d 1189, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71.\n\nConvictions for trafficking controlled substances with intent to distribute and conspiracy based on a single act.— Where defendant was convicted of trafficking a controlled substance by possession with intent to distribute in violation of 30-31-20(A) NMSA 1978 and conspiracy to commit the same crime in violation of this section, both charges based on evidence of a single sale of drugs by defendant; the defendant's conduct underlying both crimes was unitary, and the state relied on the same evidence, the single sale of drugs from defendant to the co-conspirator, as the basis to convict for both crimes; the defendant was convicted twice and is being punished twice for the same offense, resulting in a double jeopardy violation.State v. Silvas, 2015-NMSC-006,aff'g2013-NMCA-093, 310 P.3d 621.\n\nTwo convictions for one conspiracy unconstitutional.— Because the defendant robbed two different victims but only one conspiracy to commit the robberies existed, it was a violation of double jeopardy to convict the defendant for two conspiracies, as he was punished twice for the same offense.State v. Jackson, 1993-NMCA-092, 116 N.M. 130, 860 P.2d 772, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 795, 858 P.2d 1274.\n\nRebuttable presumption that multiple crimes are the object of only one overarching conspiratorial agreement.— Where the jury returned four conspiracy convictions against defendant arising from one shooting, conspiracy to commit aggravated battery (great bodily harm), conspiracy to commit aggravated battery (deadly weapon), conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and conspiracy to commit shooting at a dwelling, the state failed to overcome the presumption of a single overarching conspiratorial agreement where the evidence established that the location and time of the alleged conspiracies were the same, the personnel involved in the several charged conspiracies were the same, and defendant's role in the several charged conspiracies was the same. Defendant's multiple conspiracy convictions violated double jeopardy.State v. Comitz, 2019-NMSC-011.\n\nRebuttable presumption of one conspiratorial agreement.— Where defendant was found guilty of conspiracy to commit criminal sexual penetration (CSPM) of a minor, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, conspiracy to commit intimidation or threatening a witness, and conspiracy to commit bribery of a witness, and where the evidence established that the conspiracy convictions involved the same victim and the same perpetrators, and occurred in the same location during the same time period, without any intervening events, the state did not present any evidence to overcome the presumption of singularity. Moreover, the actions of defendant and defendant's son were aimed at furthering a single goal or purpose, facilitating the commission of CSPM upon the victim.State v. Garcia, 2019-NMCA-056, cert. denied.\n\nThe state failed to rebut the presumption of singularity.— Where petitioner pleaded guilty to three conspiracy crimes, two conspiracies to commit nonresidential burglary and conspiracy to commit larceny, the state failed to overcome the presumption of singularity where although the three conspiracies occurred at three separate locations and the elements of nonresidential burglary and larceny do not have similar overt acts, the state failed to introduce evidence of intervening conduct or distinct conspiratorial agreements, there was no conclusive evidence that there was more than one other coconspirator, and the record establishes that petitioner was the constant actor in each of the three alleged conspiracies. The evidence did not demonstrate more than one agreement between two or more coconspirators nor that two conspirators made multiple agreements in such a way that would justify multiple punishments under the conspiracy statute.Torres v. Santistevan, 2023-NMSC-021.\n\nConviction for multiple conspiracies violated double jeopardy.— Where defendant and another assailant broke into the home of the victim armed with metal bars or bats and defendant struck victim with a metal bar, there was only one conspiracy to commit multiple crimes and defendant's conviction of the lesser conspiracy to commit aggravated battery violated double jeopardy.State v. Trujillo, 2012-NMCA-112, 289 P.3d 238, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-011.\n\nWhere, following a fight at a bar between the victim and a conspirator, defendant and a conspirator assaulted the victim at a conspirator's residence and tied the victim up; defendant guarded the victim with a knife; another conspirator gave the victim an overdose of heroin; defendant and conspirators carried the victim to the victim's car and drove the car to a church; the victim was still alive; defendant tried three times to snap the victim's neck, a conspirator tried to suffocate the victim with a plastic bag, and defendant tried to strangle the victim with the victim's shoelaces; defendant and the conspirators left the church and after consulting with other conspirators, returned to the church and set the victim and the victim's car on fire; defendant and other conspirators went to the residence of a conspirator with whom the victim had the bar fight and the conspirator paid fifty dollars to each conspirator; the entire sequence of events from the bar fight to the arson of the victim's car occurred within an eight hour period; during that time, the conspirators exchanged numerous phone calls; and defendant was convicted of conspiracies to commit kidnapping, first degree murder, and aggravated arson, defendant entered into only one agreement and took part in only one conspiracy and the court vacated defendant's convictions of conspiracy to commit kidnapping and arson.State v. Gallegos, 2011-NMSC-027, 149 N.M. 704, 254 P.3d 655.\n\nIV. EVIDENCE AND PROOF.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nTraffic in drugs in a drug-free school zone.— To convict a defendant of conspiracy to traffic drugs in a drug-free school zone, the state must prove that the defendant had knowledge that the transaction was occurring within a drug-free school zone.State v. Wilson, 2010-NMCA-018, 147 N.M. 706, 228 P.3d 490, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-001, 147 N.M. 673, 227 P.3d 1055.\n\nOther evidence.— While common design is the essence of a conspiracy, this fact may be established by evidence other than that the parties came together and actually agreed upon a method of operation for the accomplishment of the offense.State v. Deaton, 1964-NMSC-062, 74 N.M. 87, 390 P.2d 966.\n\nLaying foundation for testimony.— When a sufficient foundation is laid by the evidence to establish the existence of a conspiracy, the acts and declarations of coconspirators in pursuance of the common purpose are admissible, whether conspiracy is directly charged or not.State v. Farris, 1970-NMCA-067, 81 N.M. 589, 470 P.2d 561.\n\nOut-of-court statements made by a coconspirator about matters relating to the conspiracy are not admissible unless and until a prima facie case of conspiracy is shown by other independent evidence.State v. Harge, 1979-NMCA-120, 94 N.M. 11, 606 P.2d 1105,overruled on other grounds byState v. Penner, 1983-NMCA-116, 100 N.M. 377, 671 P.2d 38.\n\nOrder of proof not dispositive.— The trial court has wide discretion in supervising the order of proof in a conspiracy case, and hence regardless of whether acts and declarations of one coconspirator were admitted prior to prima facie proof of a conspiracy, the dispositive issue was whether there was prima facie proof of a conspiracy apart from those acts and declarations, that is, evidence sufficient to make a prima facie case which would support a finding.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-126, 90 N.M. 12, 558 P.2d 1151.\n\nPresenting co-defendant's guilty plea in defendant's conspiracy trial.— The fact that a co-defendant has pled guilty to conspiracy to commit murder, presented to the jury in a case involving the defendant's conspiracy, does not come within Rule 803(22), N.M.R. Evid. (now seeParagraph V of Rule 11-803 NMRA), and is hearsay.State v. Urioste, 1980-NMCA-103, 94 N.M. 767, 617 P.2d 156, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 806, 617 P.2d 1321.\n\nB. CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.\n\nConspiracy proved by inference.— Conspiracy consists of knowingly combining with another for the purpose of committing a felony within or without this state. Direct evidence of an overt act is not required and the crime of conspiracy is complete when the felonious agreement is reached. The agreement may be inferred from statements relating circumstances from which the jury could infer that defendant had agreed to act with another.State v. Gonzales, 2008-NMCA-146, 145 N.M. 110, 194 P.3d 725, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-009, 145 N.M. 257, 196 P.3d 488;State v. Lopez, 2007-NMSC-049, 142 N.M. 613, 168 P.3d 743;State v. Walters, 2007-NMSC-050, 142 N.M. 644, 168 P.3d 1068.\n\nEstablished through circumstantial evidence.— A conspiracy may be established by circumstantial evidence, the agreement being a matter of inference from the facts and circumstances, which, considered as a whole, show the parties united to accomplish the fraudulent scheme.State v. Ross, 1974-NMCA-028, 86 N.M. 212, 521 P.2d 1161.\n\nWhether the defendant combined with another for an unlawful purpose may be shown by circumstantial evidence or by a showing that evidence exists from which reasonable inferences may be drawn supporting the existence of a conspiracy as shown from the facts and circumstances.In re Ruben O., 1995-NMCA-051, 120 N.M. 160, 899 P.2d 603, cert. denied, 120 N.M. 68, 898 P.2d 120.\n\nCircumstantial evidence for fact of inception of common design.— Question of when conspirators began to act in pursuance of a common design is ordinarily not the subject of direct proof; circumstances must be relied on to establish the fact.State v. Farris, 1970-NMCA-067, 81 N.M. 589, 470 P.2d 561.\n\nAgreement a matter of inference.— A mutually implied understanding is sufficient so far as combination or confederacy is concerned, which agreement is generally a matter of inference deduced from the facts and circumstances, and from the acts of the person accused done in pursuance of an apparent criminal purpose.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-126, 90 N.M. 12, 558 P.2d 1151;State v. Deaton, 1964-NMSC-062, 74 N.M. 87, 390 P.2d 966.\n\nInference of conspiracy.— Conspiracy is seldom susceptible of direct proof and is usually established by inference from the conduct of the parties.State v. Dressel, 1973-NMCA-113, 85 N.M. 450, 513 P.2d 187;State v. Sheets, 1981-NMCA-064, 96 N.M. 75, 628 P.2d 320, cert. quashed, 96 N.M. 116, 628 P.2d 686.\n\nC. ACTS OF CONSPIRATORS.\n\nActs and declarations of coconspirators may be admitted into evidencewhether or not conspiracy is directly charged.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-126, 90 N.M. 12, 558 P.2d 1151.\n\nActs made during existence of conspiracy.— The acts and declarations of a conspirator to be admissible against his coconspirator must occur during the existence of the conspiracy.State v. Farris, 1970-NMCA-067, 81 N.M. 589, 470 P.2d 561.\n\nAct made prior to consummation of crime.— A conspirator may testify to acts done or statements made by a coconspirator from the commencement to the consummation of the offense.State v. Robinson, 1972-NMCA-080, 84 N.M. 2, 498 P.2d 694.\n\nActs made prior to abandonment.— Rule that statements of a conspirator made after abandonment of the conspiracy or after it has terminated without accomplishing its object are inadmissible as against a co-conspirator, refers to those statements originally made among conspirators, and not the testimony given at trial about those statements.State v. Robinson, 1972-NMCA-080, 84 N.M. 2, 498 P.2d 694.\n\nActs prior to inception of conspiracy.— While the acts and declarations of one conspirator during the existence of a conspiracy are competent evidence against his coconspirators, no act or declaration made before the inception of the conspiracy may be binding, or given in evidence against the coconspirator on trial.State v. Farris, 1970-NMCA-067, 81 N.M. 589, 470 P.2d 561.\n\nD. SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.\n\nConspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine.— Where the evidence showed that defendant and others went into a store to purchase Sudafed for methamphetamine, that each person went into the store separately in order to purchase a larger quantity of Sudafed, that Sudafed was used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, and that defendant actually manufactured methamphetamine on the day after the trip to the store to purchase the Sudafed, the jury could reasonably conclude that defendant conspired to manufacture methamphetamine.State v. Brown, 2010-NMCA-079, 148 N.M. 888, 242 P.3d 455, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-007, 148 N.M. 611, 241 P.3d 612.\n\nConspiracy to intimidate a witness.— Evidence that defendant agreed with an accused murderer to appear in court to shake up an eye witness to the murder and make him afraid to testify truthfully or to have a lapse of memory in the murder trial and to otherwise attempt to make sure that the witness refrained from testifying in a manner that would harm the accused murderer, was sufficient to support the conviction of defendant for conspiracy to intimidate a witness. State v. Martinez, 2008-NMCA-019, 143 N.M. 428, 176 P.3d 1160, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-001, 143 N.M. 397, 176 P.3d 1129.\n\nConspiracy to commit kidnapping.— Evidence that defendants, following an argument with the victims about missing drugs, made the victims strip to their underwear and sit on a couch, that one defendant held a knife to the throat of one victim, that defendants searched victims' clothes for the missing drugs, and that defendants removed money and identification from the victims' clothes, was sufficient to support an inference that the defendants worked together to confine the victims in the apartment and was sufficient to support the convictions for conspiracy to commit kidnapping.State v. Herrera, 2015-NMCA-116, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-010.\n\nConspiracy to commit forgery.— In defendant's trial for forgery, where the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that four personal checks belonging to four different people were washed and passed at four different times, and where there was testimony that defendant had entered into an agreement with others to change genuine checks so that their effect was different from the original, there was sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed conspiracy to commit forgery.State v. Estrada, 2016-NMCA-066, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of conspiracy to commit fraudulent use of a credit card.— Where defendant was convicted of fourth-degree fraudulent use of a credit card (over $500) and conspiracy to commit fraudulent use of a credit card, and where defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support her conviction for conspiracy, arguing that the state did not present direct or circumstantial evidence from which the jury could determine that an agreement was reached with another person, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the jury's determination that defendant agreed with at least one other person to commit fraudulent use of a credit card where, at trial, the state admitted into evidence the receipts for nine unauthorized credit card transactions made over the course of five consecutive days and offered testimony that defendant appeared in surveillance footage conducting one of the credit card transactions and used the same job identifier for her purchase as did another unauthorized user of the credit card in a separate transaction. From this evidence, a rational jury could reasonably infer that there was some level of agreement and coordination among the users of the credit card based on the use of the same job identifier in multiple transactions, that defendant must have received the credit card from another unauthorized user of the credit card because she used the credit card to make a purchase one day after it was used in the first transaction by another person, and that defendant must have given the credit card to another person who used the credit card three more times in the two days after defendant used the credit card.State v. Herrera, 2024-NMCA-025, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.— Where defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, and where the state presented evidence at trial that defendant spent the day before the murder with another man who had a motive to kill the victim, that defendant secured for himself and the other man a ride to the apartment complex where the victim lived, that defendant and the other man disappeared from sight before gunshots were heard, that defendant and the other man were seen running back to their vehicle before driving off, and that occupants of the vehicle testified that defendant smelled like burnt matches, which is similar to the smell of gunpowder, there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that defendant was part of an agreement with one or more to murder the victim.State v. Torres, 2018-NMSC-013.\n\nEvidence sufficient.— Where defendant's primary co-conspirator beat, drugged, and tied the victim to a bed in defendant's residence; defendant did not object to the treatment of the victim; while the primary co-conspirator was absent from the residence for a lengthy period of time, defendant watched the victim and did not assist the victim or call the police; defendant did not object when the primary co-conspirator expressed an intention to kill the victim and burn the victim's car; defendant purchased charcoal lighter fluid at the direction of the primary co-conspirator; defendant did not object when defendant's co-conspirators put the victim in the trunk of the victim's car; and while defendant remained at the residence, defendant's co-conspirators used the lighter fluid to burn the car and kill the victim, there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of conspiracy to commit kidnapping.State v. Bahney, 2012-NMCA-039, 274 P.3d 134, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-003.\n\nWhere defendant's friends asked defendant for a ride from a party; one of the friends suggested that they go \"do some shootings\"; defendant agreed to the plan and drove to the location of a trailer selected by the friend; the friend exited defendant's vehicle and fired three shots at the trailer; the owner of the trailer had recently moved from the trailer, but kept some possessions in the trailer and parked two vehicles in front of the trailer; and defendant claimed that defendant had no reason to know that the trailer was occupied at the time of the shooting, the evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant had the requisite intent to agree and the intent to commit shooting at a dwelling.State v. Coleman, 2011-NMCA-087, 150 N.M. 622, 264 P.3d 523, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-008, 268 P.3d 513.\n\nWhere there was evidence that defendant or accomplice or both assaulted victim and split the money taken from the victim, this is sufficient evidence for the conviction of conspiracy to commit a robbery.State v. Lopez, 2005-NMSC-036, 138 N.M. 521, 123 P.3d 754, overruled on other grounds,State v. Frawley, 2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\nThe size, frequency and manner of the transactions were evidence sustaining defendant's conviction for conspiracy with two others to traffic in heroin.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-125, 90 N.M. 10, 558 P.2d 1149.\n\nReview of the record indicates the existence of substantial evidence to support the jury verdicts for conspiracy to commit fraud, and the evidence was such that the jury could reasonably determine that defendants knowingly committed the offense of conspiracy to commit fraud upon the district and state in excess of $20,000.State v. Crews, 1989-NMCA-088, 110 N.M. 723, 799 P.2d 592, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 232, 784 P.2d 419.\n\nSeries of agreements.— The evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of separate counts of conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping and armed robbery, where the evidence in the light most favorable to the state showed a distinct agreement to commit each crime.State v. Reyes, 2002-NMSC-024, 132 N.M. 576, 52 P.3d 948.\n\nTampering with evidence.— Where there is no evidence suggesting that defendant encouraged his accomplice to dispose of the gun or was present when the accomplice threw it away, there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions for tampering with evidence and conspiracy to tamper with evidence.State v. Armijo, 2005-NMCA-010, 136 N.M. 723, 104 P.3d 1114.\n\nSufficient evidence of conspiracy to commit tampering with evidence.— Where defendant was convicted of second-degree murder, tampering with evidence and conspiracy to commit tampering with evidence, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for conspiracy to commit tampering with evidence where the State sought to prove that defendant and another person by words or conduct agreed together to commit tampering with evidence by destroying a vehicle linked to the murder, and where the evidence at trial established that defendant drove the vehicle away from the shooting, left it parked in an alley and contacted an unidentified person who helped defendant obtain and pour gasoline on the vehicle and then start it on fire. Based on this evidence, the jury rationally could have concluded that defendant and the unidentified person who accompanied him to the gas station and the alley where the vehicle was parked agreed by words or conduct to set the car on fire with the intent to destroy evidence.State v. Chavez, 2022-NMCA-007, cert. granted.\n\nConspiracy to commit tampering with evidence conviction reversed where conviction for underlying offense was reversed.— Where defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit tampering with evidence in the fourth degree, based on a finding that defendant tampered with evidence of second degree murder, making the tampering at issue a third degree tampering with evidence, and where the district court erred in instructing the jury, thus requiring the reversal of defendant's second-degree murder conviction, defendant's conviction for conspiracy to commit tampering with evidence also required reversal, because the reversal of defendant's murder conviction rendered the degree of tampering that was conspired to be committed indeterminate, and where a jury does not find the level of the underlying offense, its determination that the defendant tampered with evidence can only support a conviction for misdemeanor tampering with evidence. This section only prohibits conspiracy to commit felonies, and therefore conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor is not a crime in New Mexico.State v. Chavez, 2022-NMCA-007, cert. granted.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Defendant's appearance along with several other people in a hardware store's surveillance footage showing burglaries was sufficient circumstantial evidence to show that defendant had agreed with at least one of the other people to commit the burglaries to support defendant's conviction for conspiracy to commit burglary.State v. Gonzales, 2008-NMCA-146, 145 N.M. 110, 194 P.3d 725, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-009, 145 N.M. 257, 196 P.3d 488.\n\nThere was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder where defendant testified that defendant incapacitated one of the occupants of a cabin while defendant's companions murdered and robbed the other occupants of the cabin.State v. Nieto, 2000-NMSC-031, 129 N.M. 688, 12 P.3d 442.\n\nSufficient evidence of underlying crime(s).— Where the jury must determine which of two underlying crimes is supported by evidence, as opposed to determining the legality or constitutionality of the underlying crimes, a conviction for conspiracy will be upheld, notwithstanding that one of the underlying crimes may not have been supported by sufficient evidence.State v. Olguin, 1994-NMCA-050, 118 N.M. 91, 879 P.2d 92,aff'd in part, 1995-NMSC-077, 120 N.M. 740, 906 P.2d 731.\n\nEvidence found sufficient for conviction.State v. Bankert, 1994-NMSC-052, 117 N.M. 614, 875 P.2d 370;State v. Sellers, 1994-NMCA-053, 117 N.M. 644, 875 P.2d 400, cert. denied, 118 N.M. 90, 879 P.2d 91;State v. Hernandez, 1997-NMCA-006, 122 N.M. 809, 932 P.2d 499.\n\nEvidence was insufficientto support verdict of conspiracy to commit trafficking by manufacture where the evidence established that there was a meth lab in the kitchen of defendant's friend's trailer and additional meth lab equipment in a bedroom; that defendant was present in the trailer, hiding in a closet in a different bedroom when the meth lab was discovered; and that both defendant and his friend were present in the trailer when the meth lab was discovered because the evidence did not lead to an inference that defendant had an agreement with friend to commit the offense of trafficking by manufacture.State v. Stefani, 2006-NMCA-073, 139 N.M. 719, 137 P.3d 659, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-006, 140 N.M. 224, 141 P.3d 1278.\n\nEvidence that defendant used his truck to block the victim from leaving defendant's property;that defendant told the other defendants involved in the beating of the victim by telephone to \"hurry up\" because defendant did not know how long he could hold the victim; that when the other defendants arrived, the defendant became involved in the beating of the victim, permitted the jury to conclude that the defendants shared an intent to hold the victim and then beat him.State v. Huber, 2006-NMCA-087, 140 N.M. 147, 140 P.3d 1096, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-007, 140 N.M. 279, 142 P.3d 360.\n\nV. INDICTMENT AND INFORMATION.\n\nSufficiency of indictment.— An indictment for conspiracy to commit perjury did not need to specify the perjury defendant allegedly conspired to commit because the offense of conspiracy was complete when the agreement was reached. State v. Benavidez, 1999-NMCA-053, 127 N.M. 189, 979 P.2d 234,aff'd in part, 1999-NMSC-041, 128 N.M. 261, 992 P.2d 274.\n\nCharging in alternative.— Where defendant was charged under two counts enveloping a single conspiracy which violated two statutes, the trial court did not err in refusing to dismiss either count as duplicitous, as although there was only one conspiracy, the two counts alternatively charged the single conspiracy.State v. Ross, 1974-NMCA-028, 86 N.M. 212, 521 P.2d 1161.\n\nWhere the conspiracy to burglarize and vandalize an insured business involved acts not covered by the arson statute (Section 30-17-5 NMSA 1978), that section was not a special provision prohibiting the prosecution of defendant under Section 30-15-3 NMSA 1978 relating to damaging insured property, for the aspect of the conspiracy directed toward burglary and vandalism.State v. Ross, 1974-NMCA-028, 86 N.M. 212, 521 P.2d 1161.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Criminal Law - The Use of Transferred Intent in Attempted Murder, a Specific Intent Crime: State v.

      "heading": "Criminal solicitation; penalty.",
      "text": "A. Except as to bona fide acts of persons authorized by law to investigate and detect the commission of offenses by others, a person is guilty of criminal solicitation if, with the intent that another person engage in conduct constituting a felony, he solicits, commands, requests, induces, employs or otherwise attempts to promote or facilitate another person to engage in conduct constituting a felony within or without the state.\n\nB. In any prosecution for criminal solicitation, it is an affirmative defense that under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of criminal intent, the defendant:\n\n(1) notified the person solicited; and\n\n(2) gave timely and adequate warning to law enforcement authorities or otherwise made a substantial effort to prevent the criminal conduct solicited.\n\nThe burden of raising this issue is on the defendant, but does not shift the burden of proof of the state to prove all of the elements of the crime of solicitation beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nC. It is not a defense that the person solicited could not be guilty of the offense solicited due to insanity, minority or other lack of criminal responsibility or incapacity. It is not a defense that the person solicited is unable to commit the crime solicited because of lack of capacity, status or other characteristic needed to commit the crime solicited, so long as the person soliciting or the person solicited believes that he or they have such capacity, status or characteristics.\n\nD. A person is not liable for criminal solicitation when his solicitation constitutes conduct of a kind that is necessarily incidental to the commission of the offense solicited. When the solicitation constitutes a felony offense other than criminal solicitation, which is related to but separate from the offense solicited, the defendant is guilty of such related felony offense and not of criminal solicitation. Provided, a defendant may be prosecuted for and convicted of both the criminal solicitation as well as any other crime or crimes committed by the defendant or his accomplices or co-conspirators [coconspirators], or the crime or crimes committed by the person solicited.\n\nE. Any person convicted of criminal solicitation shall be punished as follows:\n\n(1) if the highest crime solicited is a capital or first degree felony, the person soliciting such felony is guilty of a second degree felony;\n\n(2) if the highest crime solicited is a second degree felony, the person soliciting such a felony is guilty of a third degree felony; and\n\n(3) if the highest crime solicited is a third degree felony or a fourth degree felony, the person soliciting such felony is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nHistory:Laws 1979, ch. 265, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nIntent.— Criminal solicitation is not committed in a vacuum; it is a specific intent crime that requires the solicitation of a substantive underlying crime. A person is guilty of criminal solicitation if, with the intent that another person engage in conduct constituting a felony, the soliciting person solicits, commands, requests, induces, employs or otherwise attempts to promote or facilitate another person to engage in conduct constituting a felony within or without the state.State v. Martinez, 2008-NMSC-060, 145 N.M. 220, 195 P.3d 1232.\n\nOffense of solicitation requires some form of actual communicationfrom the defendant to either an intermediary or the person intended to be solicited, indicating the subject matter of the solicitation.State v. Cotton, 1990-NMCA-025, 109 N.M. 769, 790 P.2d 1050, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 751, 790 P.2d 1032.\n\nUnder this section, proof that defendant solicited, commanded, requested, induced, or employed another to commit a felony necessarily requires evidence that the defendant, in some manner, in fact communicated the solicitation to the person or persons intended to be solicited.State v. Cotton, 1990-NMCA-025, 109 N.M. 769, 790 P.2d 1050, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 751, 790 P.2d 1032.\n\nOffense complete when solicitation made.— The offense of solicitation is complete when the solicitation is made and it is immaterial that the object of the solicitation is never consummated, or that no overt steps are subsequently taken toward its consummation.State v. Casteneda, 1982-NMCA-046, 97 N.M. 670, 642 P.2d 1129.\n\nAgreement not required.— The crime of solicitation does not require an agreement. There need be only unilateral acts on the part of the accused of an inducement or request for another to commit a felony.State v. Gilbert, 1982-NMCA-081, 98 N.M. 77, 644 P.2d 1066.\n\n\"Facilitate\" and \"promote\" construed.— The terms \"facilitate\" and \"promote\" have common, well defined definitions, meaning respectively \"to make easier or less difficult,\" and to \"further, or encourage.\"State v. Casteneda, 1982-NMCA-046, 97 N.M. 670, 642 P.2d 1129.\n\nSufficient evidence of criminal solicitation to commit tampering with evidence.— Where defendant was charged with voluntary manslaughter in the stabbing death of his friend, and where the evidence established that defendant called his girlfriend from the jail knowing that the police were investigating the stabbing, and told her to take his backpack, which contained cans of Dust-Off that the victim had been sniffing or \"huffing\", and when defendant's girlfriend told defendant that she could not because the police were everywhere, defendant asked her to take the Dust-Off cans out of the backpack and tell the police the backpack belonged to someone else, the evidence supports findings that defendant intended his girlfriend to tamper with evidence consisting of his backpack and the Dust-Off cans inside it and that defendant requested his girlfriend to tamper with evidence by concealing it and lying about ownership of the backpack, for the purpose of preventing his prosecution or conviction for stabbing the victim.State v. Fox, 2017-NMCA-029, cert. granted.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Even though, under Subsection D of this section, defendant could be convicted of criminal solicitation and conspiracy to commit murder, the trial court's merger of the two offenses for sentencing purposes violated his right to be protected from double jeopardy.State v. Vallejos, 2000-NMCA-075, 129 N.M. 424, 9 P.3d 668, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 385, 9 P.3d 68.\n\nConvictions of voluntary manslaughter and aggravated burglary did not violate double jeopardy.— Where defendant shot the victim in the chest in defendant's vehicle, drove the unconscious victim in the vehicle to an isolated area, and defendant shot the victim twice in the head while the victim was still alive, defendant's convictions of voluntary manslaughter for shooting the victim in the chest and aggravated battery for shooting the victim in the head were not based on unitary conduct and did not violate defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy.State v. Urioste, 2011-NMCA-121, 267 P.3d 820, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-012.\n\nSolicitation incidental to conspiracy to commit murder.— The last sentence of Subsection D means that the charges of both criminal solicitation and conspiracy to commit murder can be prosecuted and submitted to the jury which can convict defendant of both charges; however, according to the first two sentences, defendant will not be held \"liable\" or \"guilty\" of criminal solicitation upon formal adjudication or entry of judgment and sentence by the trial court.State v. Vallejos, 2000-NMCA-075, 129 N.M. 424, 9 P.3d 668, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 385, 9 P.3d 68.\n\nSolicitation incidental to conspiracy or liability as accessory.— If the theory of guilt of the principal offense is that of accessory liability for fraud or conspiracy to commit fraud, solicitation will be necessarily incidental to it and there can be no liability for solicitation.State v. McCall, 1983-NMCA-109, 101 N.M. 616, 686 P.2d 958,rev'd on other grounds, 1984-NMSC-007, 101 N.M. 32, 677 P.2d 1068.\n\nSeparate sentences for conspiracy and solicitation, if solicitation constitutes conspiracy, impermissible.— A formal adjudication of guilt of both conspiracy to commit and solicitation of the same felony is proper; however, the imposition of a separate sentence for solicitation when (1) a defendant is convicted and sentenced for conspiracy and (2) the solicitation also constitutes the conspiracy is not permissible.State v. Shade, 1986-NMCA-072, 104 N.M. 710, 726 P.2d 864, cert. quashed, 104 N.M. 702, 726 P.2d 856,overruled on other grounds byState v.

Pinson, 1995-NMCA-045, 119 N.M. 752, 895 P.2d 274.\n\nAm.
