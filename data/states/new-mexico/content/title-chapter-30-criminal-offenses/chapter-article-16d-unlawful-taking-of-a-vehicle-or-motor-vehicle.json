Unlawful taking of a vehicle or motor vehicle consists of a person taking any vehicle or motor vehicle as defined by the Motor Vehicle Code [Chapter 66, Articles 1 to 8 NMSA 1978] intentionally and without consent of the owner. Whoever commits unlawful taking of a vehicle or motor vehicle is guilty of a:\n\n(1) fourth degree felony for a first offense;\n\n(2) third degree felony for a second offense; and\n\n(3) second degree felony for a third or subsequent offense.\n\nB. The consent of the owner of the vehicle or motor vehicle to its taking shall not in any case be presumed or implied because of the owner's consent on a previous occasion to the taking of the vehicle or motor vehicle by the same or a different person.\n\nC. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the holder of a lien duly recorded with the motor vehicle division of the taxation and revenue department from taking possession of a vehicle to which possession the lienholder is legally entitled under the provisions of the instrument evidencing the lien. A holder of a duly recorded lien who takes possession of a vehicle without the knowledge of the owner of the vehicle shall immediately notify the local police authority of the fact that the holder has taken possession of the vehicle.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 64-3-504, enacted by Laws 1978, ch. 35, § 91; 1998, ch. 67, § 2; § 66-3-504 NMSA 1978 recompiled and amended as § 30-16D-1 by Laws 2009, ch. 253, § 1 and Laws 2009, ch. 261, § 1.\n\nRecompilations.— Laws 2009, ch. 253, § 1 and Laws 2009, ch. 261, § 1 recompiled and amended former 66-3-504 NMSA 1978, relating to unlawful taking of a vehicle or motor vehicle, as 30-16D-1 NMSA 1978, effective July 1, 2009.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection A, at the beginning of the sentence, deleted \"Any person who\" and added the language up to \"any vehicle\"; after \"motor vehicle\", added \"as defined by the Motor Vehicle Code\" and added the language at the beginning of the sentence up to \"is\", in Paragraph (8) of Subsection A, after \"fourth degree felony\", deleted \"if the vehicle or motor vehicle has a value of less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500)\" and added \"for a first offense\"; in Paragraph (2) of Subsection, after \"felony\", deleted \"if the vehicle or motor vehicle has a value of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) or more\"; and added \"for a second offense\"; added Paragraph (3) of Subsection A; deleted former Subsection C, which provided that district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over offenses prescribed in this section; and in Subsection C, changed \"division\" to \"motor vehicle division of the taxation and revenue department\".\n\nLaws 2009, ch. 253, § 1 enacted identical amendments to this section. The section was set out as amended by Laws 2009, ch. 261, § 1.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nSpecification of \"anything of value\" resulted in double jeopardy.— Where the child was charged with armed robbery for taking both an automobile and the keys to the automobile in violation of Section 30-16-2 NMSA 1978 and for the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle in violation of Section 30-16D-1 NMSA 1978, the child's conduct underlying both crimes was unitary; and both convictions required the same proof of the theft of the automobile, the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle conviction was subsumed by the robbery conviction and the child's conviction for both resulted in double jeopardy.State v. Gutierrez, 2011-NMSC-024, 150 N.M. 232, 258 P.3d 1024.\n\nSufficient evidence to prove unlawful taking of a motor vehicle.— In delinquency proceedings where the child was charged with unlawful taking of a motor vehicle and reckless driving, there was sufficient evidence to support the jurors' reasonable determination that the child committed the delinquent act of unlawful taking of a motor vehicle where the state, in addition to presenting Facebook messages in which the child apologized to the victim and claimed that she was intoxicated when she took the victim's vehicle, presented testimony from the victim that after getting out of his vehicle to hug the child goodbye, the child pushed him aside and took off in his vehicle without his permission, and that she failed to stop even though he ran after her, banged on the driver side window, and yelled for her to stop.State v. Jesenya O., 2021-NMCA-030, 493 P.3d 418,rev'd on other grounds by2022-NMSC-014.",

Receiving or transferring a stolen vehicle or motor vehicle consists of a person who, with intent to procure or pass title to a vehicle or motor vehicle as defined by the Motor Vehicle Code [Chapter 66, Articles 1 to 8 NMSA 1978] that the person knows or has reason to believe has been stolen or unlawfully taken, receives or transfers possession of the vehicle or motor vehicle from or to another or who has in the person's possession any vehicle that the person knows or has reason to believe has been stolen or unlawfully taken. This section shall not apply to an officer of the law engaged at the time in the performance of the officer's duty as an officer.\n\nB. Whoever commits receiving or transferring a stolen vehicle or motor vehicle is guilty of a:\n\n(1) fourth degree felony for a first offense;\n\n(2) third degree felony for a second offense; and\n\n(3) second degree felony for a third or subsequent offense.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 64-3-505, enacted by Laws 1978, ch. 35, § 92; 1978 Comp., § 66-3-505, recompiled and amended as § 30-16D-4 by Laws 2009, ch. 253, § 4 and Laws 2009, ch. 261, § 4.\n\nRecompilations.— Laws 2009, ch. 253, § 4 and Laws 2009, ch. 261, § 4 recompiled and amended former 66-3-505 NMSA 1978, relating to receiving or transferring stolen vehicles or motor vehicles, as 30-16D-4 NMSA 1978, effective July 1, 2009.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection A, at the beginning of the first sentence, added \"Receiving or transferring a stolen vehicle or motor vehicle consists of\"; after \"motor vehicle\", in the first sentence, added \"defined by the Motor Vehicle Code that the person\"; at the beginning of the second sentence, added \"This section shall not apply to\" and after \"the officer's duty as an officer\", deleted the remainder of the sentence which provided that the offense was a fourth degree felony and prescribed penalties; and added Subsection B.\n\nLaws 2009, ch. 253, § 4 enacted identical amendments to this section. The section was set out as amended by Laws 2009, ch. 261, § 4.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nStatute defines two separate crimes.— This statute, 30-16D-4 NMSA 1978, defines two separate crimes: (1) taking, receiving, or transferring possession of a vehicle with knowledge or reason to believe it is stolen and with intent to procure or pass title, and (2) unlawful possession of a stolen vehicle. The legislature's use of the word \"or\" indicates that a person who possesses a stolen vehicle is independent from a person who, with intent to procure or pass title to a vehicle, receives or transfers possession of the vehicle.State v. Bernard, 2015-NMCA-089.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of four counts of receiving or transferring stolen vehicles for his unlawful possession of a stolen enclosed trailer, a snowmobile, and two all-terrain vehicles, defendant's claim that the jury instructions failed to instruct the jury that it was required to find that defendant intended to procure or pass title to a vehicle, and therefore improperly omitted an essential element of the offense of possession of a stolen vehicle, was without merit, because the \"intent to procure or pass title to a vehicle\" is not an essential element of the crime of possession of a stolen vehicle, which is a separate and distinct offense under 30-16D-4 NMSA 1978.State v. Bernard, 2015-NMCA-089.\n\nDouble jeopardy analysis applied to unlawful possession of stolen vehicles.— Where defendant was convicted of four counts of receiving or transferring stolen vehicles for his unlawful possession of a stolen enclosed trailer, a snowmobile, and two all-terrain vehicles (ATV), and where defendant claimed that his four convictions based on a single statute violated the double jeopardy protection against multiple punishments for the same offense, defendant's four convictions were justified because the language of the statute indicates that the legislature sought to address the harm inflicted on the public by a particularized type of criminal enterprise: vehicle theft. Because 30-16D-4 NMSA 1978 appears designed to protect the public from the trafficking of stolen vehicles, it follows that the legislature intended to allow for separate charges for each stolen vehicle separately possessed by an individual. Defendant's acts of possession of a trailer, a snowmobile, and two ATVs are sufficiently distinct to justify four convictions for possession of a stolen vehicle.State v. Bernard, 2015-NMCA-089.\n\nEvidence sufficient to convict of possession of stolen vehicle.— Where the evidence showed that a stolen vehicle was parked next to defendant's house, the vehicle was partially covered with a tarp, numerous parts had been removed from the vehicle, and the vehicle was covered with dust, the jury could reasonably infer that defendant possessed the stolen vehicle.State v. Brown, 2010-NMCA-079, 148 N.M. 888, 242 P.3d 455, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-007, 148 N.M. 610, 241 P.3d 611.\n\nSufficient evidence of receiving or transferring a stolen vehicle.— Where defendant was convicted of receiving or transferring a stolen vehicle, and where the state presented evidence that defendant, when stopped by police, was driving a vehicle that had been reported stolen and that the owner of the vehicle identified the vehicle defendant was driving as the one reported stolen, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for receiving or transferring a stolen vehicle.State v. Ford, 2019-NMCA-073.",
