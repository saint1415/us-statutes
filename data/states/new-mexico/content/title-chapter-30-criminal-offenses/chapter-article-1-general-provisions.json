      "text": "The Criminal Code has no application to crimes committed prior to its effective date.\n\nA crime is committed prior to the effective date of the Criminal Code if any of the essential elements of the crime occurred before that date.\n\nProsecutions for prior crimes shall be governed, prosecuted and punished under the laws existing at the time such crimes were committed.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-1-2, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 1-2.\n\nIndian country.— Where a state road, which was built on land owned by the federal government and administered by the United States forest service pursuant to an easement granted to the state by the forest service, served as the border between two pueblos, but was not within either pueblo and where there has been no explicit congressional or executive action recognizing the property as Indian country or transferring the property for the use of Indians or to the bureau of Indian affairs, the road was not located in Indian country for purposes of criminal jurisdiction.State v. Quintana, 2008-NMSC-012, 143 N.M. 535, 178 P.3d 820,aff'g2008-NMCA-025, 143 N.M. 538, 178 P.3d 823.\n\nA person need not be enrolled in a tribe to be recognized as an Indian for purposes of criminal jurisdiction.— Where the state filed a petition to revoke defendant's probation, alleging that he violated a condition of his probation by committing two new offenses, battery on a household member and criminal damage to property, and that the charged offenses occurred on the Mescalero Apache reservation and that the offenses involved two non-tribal members, but where defendant presented additional facts by proffer that he is 7/32 Mescalero by blood, that he is an affiliate of the tribe, that he attended school on the reservation, and that he receives services on the reservation, the district court erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction because enrollment as a member of a recognized tribe or pueblo is not a mandatory prerequisite for Indian status. A court must consider other factors to determine whether tribal or federal recognition as an Indian is satisfied.State v. Salazar, 2020-NMCA-021.\n\nThis section was enacted as a transitional ruleprior to the enactment of the Criminal Code.State v. Shay, 2004-NMCA-077, 136 N.M. 8, 94 P.3d 8, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-002, 137 N.M. 266, 110 P.3d 74.\n\nApplication of savings clause of this section.— Based upon the savings clause of the Criminal Code, found in this section, and N.M. Const., art. IV, § 33, providing that no person shall be exempt from prosecution for any crime by reason of repeal of the law in question, the court correctly applied former 41-16-1, 1953 Comp., the Habitual Criminal Act (now Section 31-18-17 NMSA 1978), when sentence was imposed on defendant.State v. Tipton, 1967-NMSC-270, 78 N.M. 600, 435 P.2d 430.\n\nSection conflict with Section 12-2A-16 NMSA 1978.— To the extent 12-2A-16 NMSA 1978, enacted in 1997, and this section, enacted in 1963, conflict, the latter enactment supercedes the prior.State v. Shay, 2004-NMCA-077, 136 N.M. 8, 94 P.3d 8, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-002, 137 N.M. 266, 110 P.3d 74.",

      "text": "In criminal cases where no provision of this code is applicable, the common law, as recognized by the United States and the several states of the Union, shall govern.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-1-3, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 1-3.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nCross references.— For provision making the common law the rule of practice and decision,see38-1-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nII. COMMON-LAW CRIMES.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nCommon-law crimes recognized.— Common-law crimes were recognized and enforced by virtue of Laws 1851, p. 144 (41-11-1, 1953 Comp.).Musgrave v. McManus, 1918-NMSC-075, 24 N.M. 227, 173 P. 196;Ex parte De Vore, 1913-NMSC-072, 18 N.M. 246, 136 P. 47.\n\nCommon-law crimes recognized only where applicable to state.— Only so much of the common law was adopted as was applicable to New Mexico's conditions and circumstances.Blake v. Hoover Motor Co., 1923-NMSC-005, 28 N.M. 371, 212 P. 738;Childers v. Talbott, 1888-NMSC-003, 4 N.M. (Gild.) 336, 16 P. 275;Bent v. Thompson, 1890-NMSC-005, 5 N.M. 408, 23 P. 234,aff'd, 138 U.S. 114, 11 S. Ct. 238, 34 L. Ed. 902 (1891);Ex parte De Vore, 1913-NMSC-072, 18 N.M. 246, 136 P. 47;Gurule v. Duran, 1915-NMSC-043, 20 N.M. 348, 149 P. 302, L.R.A. 1915F. 648 (1915).\n\nCommon-law crimes recognized when not in conflict with constitution or laws.— The territorial legislature adopted the common law, as the rule of practice and decision in criminal cases, thereby incorporating into the body of our law the common law, lex non scripta, of England, and such British statutes of a general nature not local to that kingdom, nor in conflict with the constitution or laws of the United States, nor of this territory, which were applicable to our condition and circumstances, and which were in force at the time of the revolution.State v. Hartzler, 1967-NMCA-022, 78 N.M. 514, 433 P.2d 231;Ex parte De Vore, 1913-NMSC-072, 18 N.M. 246, 136 P. 47.\n\nApplication of common law.— The common law of crimes applies except where the common law has been changed by statute.State v. Willis, 1982-NMCA-151, 98 N.M. 771, 652 P.2d 1222 (specially concurring opinion).\n\nStrict construction of statutes.— The common-law rule for strict construction of criminal statutes was in force inNew Mexico. Territory v. Davenport, 1912-NMSC-023, 17 N.M. 214, 124 P. 795.\n\nCommon-law year-and-a-day rule abolished.— The common-law year-and-a-day rule, under which, if a person injured by an assailant survived beyond a year and a day after receiving the injuries, the defendant was excused from criminal culpability for the death, should no longer be recognized in this jurisdiction. Due to modern advances in medical and criminal science and technology, the rationale behind the rule no longer exists.State v. Gabehart, 1992-NMCA-074, 114 N.M. 183, 836 P.2d 102.\n\nB. PARTICULAR OFFENSES.\n\nPerjury.— At common law, perjury was committed when a lawful oath was administered in some judicial proceeding to a person who swore willfully, absolutely and falsely in matters material to the issue, and it was perjury to take a false oath in justifying bail in any of the courts or before any person acting as a court, justice or tribunal, having power to hold such proceedings. Hence, a surety on an appeal bond from a justice of the peace (now magistrate) who swore falsely regarding his property was guilty of perjury even where the statute did not require an oath from him.Territory v. Weller, 1883-NMSC-004, 2 N.M. 470.\n\nPrison breach.— Prison breach, a common-law practice, was punishable in New Mexico under laws 1851, p. 144 (41-11-1, 1953 Comp.).Ex parte De Vore, 1913-NMSC-072, 18 N.M. 246, 136 P. 47 (decided under prior law).\n\nOffense against public decency.— The common law is sufficiently broad to punish as a misdemeanor, although there may be no exact precedent, any act which directly injures or tends to injure the public to such an extent as to require the state to interfere and punish the wrongdoer, as in the case of acts which injuriously affect public morality or obstruct or pervert public justice or the administration of government; and it is the common law of this commonwealth that whatever openly outrages decency and is injurious to public morals is a misdemeanor and punishable at law.State v. Hartzler, 1967-NMCA-022, 78 N.M. 514, 433 P.2d 231.\n\nIndecent treatment of dead body.— The offense, which was and is punishable at common law, is that of indecency in the treatment or handling of a dead human body. That which outrages or shocks the public sense of decency and morals, or that which contravenes the established and known public standards of decency and morals, relative to the care, treatment or disposition of a dead human body, is punishable as an act of indecency.State v. Hartzler, 1967-NMCA-022, 78 N.M. 514, 433 P.2d 231.\n\nThe length of time the body was kept, the manner and places in which it was kept, the obvious facts of changes in and decomposition of the body, and the concealment of the body from the police officers, all evidence failure to conform to the acceptable standards of decency and morals of our society in the treatment or handling of a dead human body.State v. Hartzler, 1967-NMCA-022, 78 N.M. 514, 433 P.2d 231.\n\nAct relating to embezzlement not part of state's common law.— The act of parliament passed in 1799 (39 Geo. III), relating to embezzlement and the decisions construing it, was not part of the common law of New Mexico.Territory v. Maxwell, 1882-NMSC-010, 2 N.M. 250.\n\nIII. CRIMINAL INTENT.\n\nExistence of criminal intent essential.— Generally speaking, when an act is prohibited and made punishable by statute only, the statute is to be construed in the light of the common law and the existence of a criminal intent is to be regarded as essential, although the terms of the statute do not require it.State v. Austin, 1969-NMCA-095, 80 N.M. 748, 461 P.2d 230.\n\nInstruction on intent jurisdictional absent legislative indication to contrary.— Except where the legislature clearly indicates a desire to eliminate the requirement of criminal intent, criminal statutes will be construed in the light of the common law and criminal intent will be required, and failure to instruct on this required element will be considered jurisdictional.State v. Fuentes, 1973-NMCA-069, 85 N.M. 274, 511 P.2d 760, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 265, 511 P.2d 751.\n\nLegislative indication must clearly appear.— The legislature may forbid the doing of an act and make its commission criminal, without regard to the intent with which such act is done; but in such case it must clearly appear from the act, from its language or clear inference, that such was the legislative intent.State v. Austin, 1969-NMCA-095, 80 N.M. 748, 461 P.2d 230.\n\nWhether criminal intent is essential is matter of construction.State v. Craig, 1962-NMSC-072, 70 N.M. 176, 372 P.2d 128.\n\nIV. INDICTMENT, TRIAL AND JUDGMENT.\n\nConstitutional provisions for presentments,indictments and information were self-executing.State v. Rogers, 1926-NMSC-028, 31 N.M. 485, 247 P. 828.\n\nIndictment for murder.— The common-law procedure being in force in New Mexico, where the statutes have adopted the common-law definition of murder, an indictment may omit a direct charge of a purpose or intent to kill as an overt act.Territory v. Montoya, 1912-NMSC-015, 17 N.M. 122, 125 P. 622.\n\nCharging assault with intent to murder.— In indictment for assault with intent to commit murder, the means or instrument of committing the assault should be stated, the common law being made, by statute, the rule of decision and practice, where not specifically changed.Territory v. Carrera, 1892-NMSC-023, 6 N.M. 594, 30 P. 872 (decided under prior law, now Rule 5-205 NMRA).\n\nRaising defense of former jeopardy.— Common law required defense of former jeopardy to be specially pleaded. It could not be raised by motion for instructed verdict at conclusion of state's case.Territory v. Lobato, 1913-NMSC-030, 17 N.M. 666, 134 P. 222,aff'd, 242 U.S. 199, 37 S. Ct. 107, 61 L. Ed. 244 (1916) (decided under prior law, now Section 30-1-10 NMSA 1978).\n\nTrial by jury.— The constitution preserves the right of trial by jury already existing, which means as it existed in the territory prior to adoption of constitution.Guiterrez v. Gober, 1939-NMSC-008, 43 N.M. 146, 87 P.2d 437.\n\nCommon-law presumption relating to spouses.— The presumption of the common law that a married woman committing a crime in presence of her husband was under coercion was rebuttable.State v. Asper, 1930-NMSC-098, 35 N.M. 203, 292 P. 225.\n\nOpportunity for defendant to speak before judgment.— On failure of trial court to ask defendant before judgment was passed whether he had anything to say why judgment should not be pronounced upon him, or to have the record affirmatively show that fact, the cause must be remanded upon that ground alone.Territory v. Herrera, 1901-NMSC-018, 11 N.M. 129, 66 P. 523 (decided under prior law).\n\nDiscretion in sentencing.— The common law gives trial courts the discretion to make sentences consecutive or concurrent.State v. Crouch, 1965-NMSC-131, 75 N.M. 533, 407 P.2d 671.\n\nAssessment of costs in criminal caseswas unknown at common law and therefore requires statutory authority.State v. Valley Villa Nursing Ctr., Inc., 1981-NMCA-133, 97 N.M. 161, 637 P.2d 843.\n\nReview of judgments.— The common law, vested the supreme court with jurisdiction to review judgments in criminal cases by writ of error.Borrego v. Territory, 1896-NMSC-011, 8 N.M. 446, 46 P. 349, cert. denied, 8 N.M. 655, 46 P. 211,aff'dsub nom. Gonzales v. Cunningham, 164 U.S. 612, 17 S. Ct. 182, 41 L. Ed. 572 (1896).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Disclosure of Medical Information - Criminal Prosecution of Medicaid Fraud in New Mexico,\" see 9 N.M.L. Rev. 321 (1979).\n\nAm.

It is a mental state of conscious wrongdoing.State v. Austin, 1969-NMCA-095, 80 N.M. 748, 461 P.2d 230.\n\nCrime as public offense.— A crime is a public offense, and all public offenses are expressly defined to be crimes in New Mexico. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-154 (opinion rendered under 40-1-2 to 40-1-4, 1953 Comp.).\n\nViolation of public law.— A \"public offense\" is the same as a \"crime,\" and may include a breach of the laws established for the protection of the public, as distinguished from an infringement of mere private rights.

A crime is a petty misdemeanor if it is so designated by law or if upon conviction thereof a sentence of imprisonment for six months or less is authorized.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-1-6, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 1-6.\n\nPolice officer may make warrantless arrest for misdemeanorif he has probable cause to believe the offense occurred in his presence.Tanberg v. Shlotis, 401 F.3d 1151 (10th Cir. 2005).\n\nSpecial statute controls over general.— This section and Section 31-19-1 NMSA 1978 refer generally to the sentence for misdemeanors; former 64-10-1, 1953 Comp., relating to fraudulent applications in motor vehicle registration and the like, provides a specific sentence for that misdemeanor. If the general statute, standing alone, would include the same matter as the special statute and thus conflict with the special statute, the special statute controls since it is considered an exception to the general statute.State v. Sawyers, 1968-NMCA-051, 79 N.M. 557, 445 P.2d 978.\n\nClassification of criminal contempt in discretion of courts.— Where the sole punishment of the criminal contemnor is a fine the New Mexico courts are free to make their own determination as to what is a \"petty\" and what is a \"serious\" offense, guided by the standards of District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U.S. 617, 57 S. Ct. 660, 81 L. Ed. 843 (1937) and other federal cases.Seven Rivers Farm, Inc. v. Reynolds, 1973-NMSC-039, 84 N.M. 789, 508 P.2d 1276.\n\nPenalty imposed as indication of nature of offense.— Under the rule in Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. 373, 86 S.Ct. 1523, 16 L. Ed. 2d 629 (1966), when the legislature has not expressed a judgment as to the seriousness of an offense by fixing a maximum penalty which may be imposed, the court is to look to the penalty actually imposed as the best evidence of the seriousness of the offense.Seven Rivers Farm, Inc. v. Reynolds, 1973-NMSC-039, 84 N.M. 789, 508 P.2d 1276;In re D'Angelo, 1986-NMSC-052, 105 N.M. 391, 733 P.2d 360.\n\nFalsely obtaining unemployment benefits is petty misdemeanor.— When Subsection C is read together with Section 51-1-38 NMSA 1978, it is clear that the crime of falsely obtaining unemployment benefits is a petty misdemeanor, for which the statute of limitations is one year under Section 30-1-8F NMSA 1978.Robinson v. Short, 1979-NMSC-099, 93 N.M. 610, 603 P.2d 720 (decided under prior law, now Section 30-1-8 NMSA 1978).\n\nViolation of municipal ordinance constitutes petty misdemeanorbecause imprisonment may not exceed 90 days.State v. Luna, 1980-NMSC-009, 93 N.M. 773, 606 P.2d 183 (decided under prior law, now Section 3-17-11 NMSA 1978).\n\nEffect of altering classification of crime.— Statute under which the placing of poison in food for dogs would be a misdemeanor (Laws 1912, ch. 38, § 2, 40-4-1, 1953 Comp.) was impliedly repealed by subsequent statute (Laws 1919, ch. 82, § 1, 40-4-2, 1953 Comp.) making such offense a felony, under rule that if the same offense, identified by name or otherwise, is altered in degree or incidents, or if a felony is changed to a misdemeanor, or vice versa, the statute making such changes has the effect of repealing the former act.State v. Anderson, 1936-NMSC-016, 40 N.M. 173, 56 P.2d 1134.\n\nFederal right to jury trial for contempt.— So long as the fine for criminal contempt which is, or may be, imposed is not more than $1000, there is no federal constitutional right to jury trial as the crime is a petty offense, nor need prosecution be by information.Seven Rivers Farm, Inc. v. Reynolds, 1973-NMSC-039, 84 N.M. 789, 508 P.2d 1276.\n\nJury trial of misdemeanor.— Those misdemeanors triable in district court do not provide for a trial by jury unless such crime was of the type which enjoyed and permitted trial by jury at the time of the adoption of N.M. Const., art. II, § 12. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-37.\n\nJury trial of misdemeanor.— Persons charged with offenses classified as misdemeanors under the Motor Vehicle Code may under Rule 23, N.M.R.

Morales, 2010-NMSC-026, 148 N.M. 305, 236 P.3d 24,rev'g2008-NMCA-155, 145 N.M. 259, 196 P.3d 490.\n\nWhere defendant was charged with aggravated criminal sexual penetration of a child less that thirteen years of age, a first degree felony, based on conduct that occurred between January 1, 1978 and December 30, 1985, the crimes committed by defendant after July 1, 1982 were not time barred as of July 1, 1997 and the 1997 amendment, which abolished the fifteen year statute of limitations for all capital felonies and first degree violent felonies applied to the crimes committed by defendant.State v. Morales, 2010-NMSC-026, 148 N.M. 305, 236 P.3d 24,rev'g2008-NMCA-155, 145 N.M. 259, 196 P.3d 490.\n\nThe 1997 amendment, which eliminated the statute of limitations on the prosecution of first degree felonies, applies prospectively.State v. Morales, 2008-NMCA-155, 145 N.M. 269, 196 P.3d 490, cert. granted, 2008-NMCERT-011,rev'd, 2010-NMSC-026, 148 N.M. 305, 236 P.3d 24.\n\nWaiver.— The statute of limitations is a substantive right that may only be waived by a defendant after consultation with counsel, and only if the waiver is knowing, intelligent and voluntary.State v. Kerby, 2007-NMSC-014, 141 N.M. 413, 156 P.3d 704.\n\nWaiver of statute of limitations.— Where defendant pleaded no contest to two second-degree felonies, attempted first-degree murder and aggravated burglary with a deadly weapon, for acts that were committed in 2010, and where, following the district court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss which asserted that the statute of limitations had run on those counts before the state filed an indictment that named him as a defendant, defendant and the state entered into an unconditional plea agreement in which defendant agreed to plead no contest to attempted first-degree murder and aggravated burglary with a deadly weapon, defendant's no contest plea waived his statute of limitations defense, and where defendant was advised of the statute of limitations, the factual and legal basis for asserting the defense, and the range of outcomes that could result from its assertion or waiver, the waiver was knowing, intelligent and voluntary.State v. Hansen, 2021-NMCA-048, cert. denied.\n\nWhere state alleges that defendant committed criminal sexual penetration of minor under 13between September and December of 1988 and in January of 1989, the applicable statute of limitations at the time defendant allegedly committed the crime is 15 years.State v. Hill, 2005-NMCA-143, 138 N.M. 693, 125 P.3d 1175, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-012, 138 N.M. 772, 126 P.3d 1136.\n\nLimitation \"not otherwise provided for\".— A limitation is \"otherwise provided for\" for purposes of Subsection H (now F), based on Subsection F (now D), which limits the prosecution of petty misdemeanors, if the punishment for the crime is such as to make it a petty misdemeanor under Section 30-1-6 NMSA 1978, even if the statute under which the defendant was charged does not expressly state the degree of the crime.Robinson v. Short, 1979-NMSC-099, 93 N.M. 610, 603 P.2d 720.\n\nPeriod begins running when crime completed.— Where the final \"taking\" under a fraudulent loan occurred on July 17, 1973, the crimes of fraud and conspiracy to defraud were completed on that date, and the limitation period began to run.State v. Thoreen, 1978-NMCA-024, 91 N.M. 624, 578 P.2d 325, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 610, 577 P.2d 1256.\n\nLimitations against prosecution for conspiracy run from time last overt actin furtherance of the conspiracy was committed.State v. Thoreen, 1978-NMCA-024, 91 N.M. 624, 578 P.2d 325, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 610, 577 P.2d 1256.\n\nTime of filing superseding indictment or information not controlling.— Although a felony charge may be initiated by the filing of a complaint, the felony must be prosecuted by indictment or information, so that at some point the complaint is superseded by an indictment or information. This section, however, does not distinguish among complaint, indictment or information, and by providing for a complaint charging a felony within the time limitation, the legislature intended that the time of filing a superseding indictment or information should not control the limitation question.State v. Martinez, 1978-NMCA-095, 92 N.M. 291, 587 P.2d 438, cert. quashed, 92 N.M. 260, 586 P.2d 1089.\n\nCharges initiated by complaint continued by later indictment.— Since upon being advised that a defendant has been indicted prior to a preliminary examination, a magistrate takes no further action in the case, charges initiated by a complaint in a magistrate court should be considered as continued by a later indictment, and for purposes of this section the prosecution should be considered as commenced by the filing of the complaint.State v. Martinez, 1978-NMCA-095, 92 N.M. 291, 587 P.2d 438, cert. quashed, 92 N.M. 260, 586 P.2d 1089.\n\nJury to consider solely date charged.— Although it is not error to instruct the jury that it must find that the crime occurred within the applicable statute of limitations, it is error not to limit the jury's consideration to the date charged in the information.State v. Foster, 1974-NMCA-150, 87 N.M. 155, 530 P.2d 949.\n\nNew prosecution potentially barred after dismissal for failure to prosecute.— If there is a dismissal of a charge for failure to prosecute, a new prosecution would be barred if initiated after the limitation period expires.State v. Martinez, 1978-NMCA-095, 92 N.M. 291, 587 P.2d 438, cert. quashed, 92 N.M. 260, 586 P.2d 1089.\n\nFiling complaint within period tolls statute.— An indictment filed prior to dismissal of a complaint but more than three years after the commission of a third degree felony may be timely because the limitation period was tolled by the filing of the complaint within the three-year period.State v. Martinez, 1978-NMCA-095, 92 N.M. 291, 587 P.2d 438, cert. quashed, 92 N.M. 260, 586 P.2d 1089.\n\nProsecution for attempted CSPM was timely because defendant's absence from the state tolled the statute of limitations.— Where defendant was convicted of one count of criminal sexual penetration of a minor (CSPM) and two counts of attempted CSPM, and where defendant claimed that one of his convictions for attempted CSPM was barred by the statute of limitations because the charging period included time that fell outside the six-year limitations period, the statute of limitations did not bar the state from prosecuting defendant, because the state presented evidence that defendant left New Mexico and moved to Arizona and was still living in Arizona when he was originally charged. Consequently, the statute of limitations for prosecuting defendant for attempted CSPM was tolled when defendant left New Mexico and while he was residing in Arizona.State v. Bahr, 2024-NMCA-075, cert. denied.\n\nThe statute of limitations prescribe time limits within which the state must commence a prosecutionby filing the initial charging documents in a case, not time limits within which a defendant must be brought to trial.State v. Collier, 2013-NMSC-015, 301 P.3d 370.\n\nStatute did not bar retrial of lesser-included offense.— Where, on February 13, 2006, defendant injured a horse causing the horse's death; on August 31, 2006, less than seven months after the horse's death, the grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with felony extreme cruelty to animals; defendant's first trial in March 2008 resulted in a mistrial due to jury deadlock; at defendant's second trial in January 2009, after the statute of limitations period for misdemeanors had run, the district court, at the state's request and without objection from defendant, instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of misdemeanor cruelty to animals; the jury acquitted defendant of the felony charge; and the district court declared a mistrial on the misdemeanor charge due to jury deadlock, the statute of limitations did not bar retrial of the misdemeanor charge because the state commenced the prosecution by timely filing the indictment on the felony charge, which necessarily included the lesser-included misdemeanor charge, within the two-year statute of limitations period for the misdemeanor charge.State v. Collier, 2013-NMSC-015, 301 P.3d 370.\n\nTime limitation instruction.— Generally, the time limitation instruction is a necessary part of the instructions; however, where the uncontradicted evidence shows the offenses were committed within the time limitation, the instruction stating the time limitation is not a required instruction, but giving it is not error.State v. Salazar, 1974-NMCA-026, 86 N.M. 172, 521 P.2d 134.\n\nError not prejudicial.— Although the offense of unlawfully drawing or discharging a firearm in a settlement was barred by the statute of limitations, which defense was timely raised in the district court, so that the trial court erred in not dismissing this count, nevertheless, no sentence was imposed for this offense, and furthermore, the elements of the offense were embraced in the crime of assault with intent to kill, for which defendant was properly convicted, so that the error was without prejudice to him.State v. Shawan, 1967-NMSC-013, 77 N.M. 354, 423 P.2d 39.\n\nFalsely obtaining unemployment benefits is petty misdemeanor.— When Section 30-1-6C NMSA 1978 is read together with Section 51-1-38 NMSA 1978, it is clear that the crime of falsely obtaining unemployment benefits is a petty misdemeanor, for which the statute of limitations is one year under Subsection F.Robinson v. Short, 1979-NMSC-099, 93 N.M. 610, 603 P.2d 720(decided under prior law, now Section 30-1-8 NMSA 1978).\n\nContributions payable under Section 51-1-19 NMSA 1978are not \"revenues\" within meaning of Subsection G.Robinson v. Short, 1979-NMSC-099, 93 N.M. 610, 603 P.2d 720 (decided under prior law).\n\nProsecution for sale of property of another not barred.— Under former law, prosecution for unlawful sale of one head of neat cattle, the property of another, was not barred where commenced within three years from time of alleged offense.State v. Stone, 1937-NMSC-050, 41 N.M. 547, 72 P.2d 9.\n\nProsecution of misdemeanor.— Under former 41-9-1, 1953 Comp., as well as this section, the maximum time for commencing prosecution for a misdemeanor was within two years from the time the offense was committed. 1957 Op.

If after any crime has been committed the defendant shall conceal himself, or shall flee from or go out of the state, the prosecution for such crime may be commenced within the time prescribed in Section 1-8 [30-1-8 NMSA 1978], after the defendant ceases to conceal himself or returns to the state. No period shall be included in the time of limitation when the party charged with any crime is not usually and publicly a resident within the state.\n\n(1) an indictment, information or complaint is lost, mislaid or destroyed;\n\n(2) the judgment is arrested;\n\n(3) the indictment, information or complaint is quashed, for any defect or reason; or\n\n(4) the prosecution is dismissed because of variance between the allegations of the indictment, information or complaint and the evidence; and a new indictment, information or complaint is thereafter presented, the time elapsing between the preferring of the first indictment, information or complaint and the subsequent indictment, information or complaint shall not be included in computing the period limited for the prosecution of the crime last charged; provided that the crime last charged is based upon and grows out of the same transaction upon which the original indictment, information or complaint was founded, and the subsequent indictment, information or complaint is brought within five years from the date of the alleged commission of the original crime.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-1-9, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 1-9.\n\nCross references.— For defects, errors and omissions in a complaint, indictment or information, and variances between the allegations therein and the evidence,seeRule 5-204 NMRA.\n\nThis section is a tolling statute, not a statute of limitations,and does not independently limit the period within which prosecution must commence.State v. Hill, 2008-NMCA-117, 144 N.M. 775, 192 P.3d 770, cert. quashed, 2009-NMCERT-009, 147 N.M. 423, 224 P.3d 650.\n\nConstitutionality.— The application of the tolling provision did not violate either defendant's right to travel or his constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws.State v. Cawley, 1990-NMSC-088, 110 N.M. 705, 799 P.2d 574.\n\nStatute not exclusive.— Although this section does show a legislative intent that the limitation period is not to be utilized to bar a prosecution delayed by procedural problems, it does not evince an intent to bar prosecutions not beset with procedural problems.State v. Martinez, 1978-NMCA-095, 92 N.M. 291, 587 P.2d 438, cert. quashed, 92 N.M. 260, 586 P.2d 1089.\n\nIndictment timely because complaint had tolled statute.— An indictment filed prior to dismissal of a complaint but more than three years after the commission of a third degree felony is timely because the limitation period was tolled by the filing of the complaint within the three-year period.State v. Martinez, 1978-NMCA-095, 92 N.M. 291, 587 P.2d 438, cert. quashed, 92 N.M. 260, 586 P.2d 1089.\n\nPeriod between dismissed complaint and refiled charges was not tolled.— Where defendant was charged in Santa Fe county with embezzlement and computer access with intent to defraud or embezzle on June 28, 2018, and where defendant filed an objection to the venue on November 29, 2018, and where the district court granted defendant's motion to dismiss both counts with prejudice for improper venue, and where, almost two months later, on August 1, 2019, a grand jury indicted defendant on the same charges in Sandoval county for conduct that occurred between December 19, 2011 and January 22, 2013, and where defendant moved to dismiss both charges, claiming that the statute of limitations had expired, the district court erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss, because this section did not exclude the period between the timely filed but dismissed complaint and the refiled charges or toll any time from the six-year statutory limitation period, and no nonstatutory tolling otherwise extended the time for the state to pursue charges in the present case.State v. Padilla, 2023-NMCA-047, cert. granted.\n\nEvidence of absence from state insufficient.— Where there was no evidence tending to show defendant's whereabouts from the time of his escape from prison on September 17, 1956 until his apprehension in Oklahoma on January 24, 1960, defendant's plea of not guilty put the statute of limitations in issue, and his motion for a directed verdict on the grounds that the three-year statute of limitations was a bar to prosecution should have been granted.State v. Oliver, 1963-NMSC-015, 71 N.M. 317, 378 P.2d 135.\n\nProsecution for attempted CSPM was timely because defendant's absence from the state tolled the statute of limitations.— Where defendant was convicted of one count of criminal sexual penetration of a minor (CSPM) and two counts of attempted CSPM, and where defendant claimed that one of his convictions for attempted CSPM was barred by the statute of limitations because the charging period included time that fell outside the six-year limitations period, the statute of limitations did not bar the state from prosecuting defendant, because the state presented evidence that defendant left New Mexico and moved to Arizona and was still living in Arizona when he was originally charged. Consequently, the statute of limitations for prosecuting defendant for attempted CSPM was tolled when defendant left New Mexico and while he was residing in Arizona.State v. Bahr, 2024-NMCA-075, cert. denied.\n\nEvidence negating residence insufficient.— There being no substantial evidence in record that defendant was not usually and publicly a resident of state, after commission of crime for sufficient time to toll statute of limitations, he was entitled to instructed verdict in his favor.State v. Mersfelder, 1927-NMSC-049, 34 N.M. 465, 284 P. 113.\n\n\"Concealing oneself\" construed.— The plain language of 30-1-9(A) NMSA 1978 suggests that a court will look to the actions of an offender after the crime was committed, and will necessarily undertake a fact-specific analysis of whether the offender's actions constituted an affirmative attempt to conceal his or her identity, and therefore, absent any evidence that the offender took affirmative steps to hide his or her identity, it is unlikely that the offender could be considered to have \"concealed\" himself or herself. Where a victim has submitted to a sexual assault evidence kit, the victim does not know the offender, and the offender has not been identified and the sexual assault evidence kit DNA has not been matched to an individual suspect, and therefore it is unlikely that a court would consider the offender to be concealing himself, because under these circumstances, there is no evidence that the offender took affirmative steps to hide his or her identity.Retroactive Application of Criminal Statute(4/27/17), Att'y Gen.

This section does not indicate whether the legislature intended the statute to apply to crimes committed before its effective date, and therefore it may be presumed that the legislature intended this section to operate prospectively. This intent is reflected in the express language of the applicability provision which states that the provisions of this act are applicable to an alleged violation of 30-9-11 NMSA 1978, for which the applicable time period for commencing a prosecution, as provided in 30-1-8 NMSA 1978, had not expired as of July 1, 2003.Retroactive Application of Criminal Statute(4/27/17), Att'y Gen.

      "text": "No person shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same crime. The defense of double jeopardy may not be waived and may be raised by the accused at any stage of a criminal prosecution, either before or after judgment. When the indictment, information or complaint charges different crimes or different degrees of the same crime and a new trial is granted the accused, he may not again be tried for a crime or degree of the crime greater than the one of which he was originally convicted.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-1-10, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 1-10.\n\nCross references.— For constitutional provision on former jeopardy,seeN.M. Const., art. II, § 15.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nWaiver of rights.— Double jeopardy rights may not be waived and may be raised by the accused at any stage of a criminal prosecution either before or after judgment. Defendant may raise the issue of violation of double jeopardy even though he expressly waived the issue during a plea hearing.State v. Jackson, 1993-NMCA-092, 116 N.M. 130, 860 P.2d 772.\n\nFinality of decision.— The trial court's oral and written statements during the proceedings did not constitute acquittals and therefore there was no violation of double jeopardy protections when the court subsequently found the defendant guilty in the same proceedings.State v. Vaughn, 2005-NMCA-076, 137 N.M. 674, 114 P.3d 354, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-006, 137 N.M. 766, 115 P.3d 229.\n\nRemoval of child from the custody of the child's parents pending an investigation of child abuse is not a punishment.— Where the children, youth and families department investigated defendants for child abuse and found the allegations to be unsubstantiated; a tribal court held a custody hearing on the same allegations and ultimately returned the child to defendants; the defendant who was the primary caretaker agreed to temporary guardianship of the child during the investigation and tribal court proceeding; and the removal of the child from the custody of defendants for fourteen months during the child abuse investigation by the department and the custody proceeding in tribal court was not intended to punish defendants, the state's prosecution of defendants for criminal child abuse did not violate double jeopardy.State v. Diggs, 2009-NMCA-099, 147 N.M. 122, 217 P.3d 608, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 361, 223 P.3d 358.\n\nIdentical counts and jury instructions.— Where multiple counts of criminal sexual penetration of a minor in the indictment and the counts in the jury instructions were carbon-copy counts of each other and where the child's testimony distinguished facts for each count and the defendant admitted to having sexual intercourse with the child on several occasions, there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could find separate incidents of criminal sexual penetration and there was no violation of double jeopardy.State v. Martinez, 2007-NMCA-160, 143 N.M. 96, 173 P.3d 18, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-011, 143 N.M. 155, 173 P.3d 762.\n\nConstitutional provision.— This section provides the same protections as N.M. Const., art. II, § 15, although those protections are more clearly stated in the statute.State v. Lynch, 2003-NMSC-020, 134 N.M. 139, 74 P.3d 73.\n\nReinstatement of convictions.— Where one of two otherwise valid convictions must be vacated to avoid violation of double jeopardy protections, the conviction carrying the shorter sentence must be vacated.State v. Montoya, 2013-NMSC-020, 306 P.3d 426.\n\nWhere defendant and defendant's companions were accosted by a rival gang in front of defendant's family home, guns were pulled on both sides and defendant's sibling was severely wounded by gunshots in the leg and abdomen; while defendant's group were trying to help defendant's sibling in the driveway and stop the bleeding from the gunshot wounds, the person in the rival gang who had been shooting at defendant and defendant's companions returned in a Ford Expedition; when defendant saw gunfire coming from the Expedition, defendant ran into the house and retrieved an AK-47 rifle and began shooting at the Expedition; the driver of Expedition was shot seven times and died; the jury convicted defendant of voluntary manslaughter and shooting into a motor vehicle resulting in great bodily harm, the conviction for voluntary manslaughter should be vacated and the conviction for shooting into a motor vehicle upheld because the conviction for shooting into a motor vehicle carried a more severe potential sentence.State v. Montoya, 2013-NMSC-020, 306 P.3d 426.\n\nState protections broader than those of federal constitution.— The differences between N.M. Const., art. II, § 15, and this section suggest that the legislature was attempting to articulate the protections of the state constitution as being broader than those of the federal constitution.State v. Lynch, 2003-NMSC-020, 134 N.M. 139, 74 P.3d 73.\n\nWhen section applied.— The double jeopardy clause only comes to the aid of defendants subjected to multiple prosecutions for the identical offense, or in such situations in which collateral estoppel, the concept of lesser included offenses or the same evidence test apply.State v. Tanton, 1975-NMSC-057, 88 N.M. 333, 540 P.2d 813.\n\nThis section precludes retrial of a greater offense only after an acquittal of that offense and does not address the situation in which the state prosecutes various crimes or degrees of crimes and the jury returns a verdict on less than all of the crimes charged.State v. Martinez, 1995-NMSC-064, 120 N.M. 677, 905 P.2d 715.\n\nThe New Mexico supreme court's statement inState v. Martinez, 1995-NMSC-064, 120 N.M. 677, 905 P.2d 715, that this section precludes a retrial of a greater offense only after an acquittal of that offense, was not intended to introduce a new principle of law into its double jeopardy jurisprudence, but rather was a summary of existing case law.State v. Lynch, 2003-NMSC-020, 134 N.M. 139, 74 P.3d 73.\n\nThis section precludes a retrial of a greater offense only after an (implied or explicit) acquittal of that offense, provided that the greater offense was charged in the first trial.State v. Lynch, 2003-NMSC-020, 134 N.M. 139, 74 P.3d 73.\n\nSection applies to children's court proceedingsinvolving delinquent child.State v. Doe, 1977-NMCA-058, 90 N.M. 536, 565 P.2d 1053.\n\nAcquittal of accused protects against second prosecution for same crime.Borrego v. Territory, 1896-NMSC-011, 8 N.M. 446, 46 P. 349,aff'dsub nom. Gonzales v. Cunningham, 164 U.S. 612, 17 S. Ct. 182, 41 L. Ed. 572 (1896).\n\nNo jeopardy if information fails to state offense.— Where information failed to state an offense at time of arraignment and entry of plea of not guilty, defendant was not placed in jeopardy.State v. Ardovino, 1951-NMSC-018, 55 N.M. 161, 228 P.2d 947.\n\nNo jeopardy if court lacks jurisdiction.— Since marijuana is not defined as a narcotic drug under the relevant statutes, a charge of violating Section 30-31-20 NMSA 1978 (trafficking) in the first proceeding brought against defendant for selling marijuana did not charge defendant with a public offense. Hence, as the court lacked jurisdiction in the first proceeding, there was no basis for a claim of double jeopardy where defendant was later charged under the proper section.State v. Mabrey, 1975-NMCA-098, 88 N.M. 227, 539 P.2d 617.\n\nNo jeopardy on retrial after appeal.— The former jeopardy clause does not preclude retrial of defendant whose sentence is set aside because of error in the proceedings leading to sentence or conviction.State v. Sneed, 1967-NMSC-272, 78 N.M. 615, 435 P.2d 768;State v. Nance, 1966-NMSC-207, 77 N.M. 39, 419 P.2d 242, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1039, 87 S. Ct. 1495, 18 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1967).\n\nConstitutional protection against double jeopardy does not prevent a second trial for the same offense where the defendant himself, by an appeal, has invoked the action which resulted in the second trial.State v. Sneed, 1967-NMSC-272, 78 N.M. 615, 435 P.2d 768.\n\nNo jeopardy after collateral attack.— Where a conviction is overturned on collateral rather than direct attack, retrial is not precluded on double jeopardy grounds.State v. Nance, 1966-NMSC-207, 77 N.M. 39, 419 P.2d 242, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1039, 87 S. Ct. 1495, 18 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1967).\n\nWaiver of defense by plea agreement.— The defendant waived his double jeopardy defense by entering a plea agreement which provided that the state could pursue additional habitual offender proceedings to enhance the defendant's sentence in the event his probation was revoked or he otherwise failed to fulfill his obligations under the agreement, and the provision precluding waiver of a double jeopardy defense did not apply to prevent waiver in such case.Montoya v. New Mexico, 55 F.3d 1496 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\nCharging in alternative.— The concept of double jeopardy was not involved in charging defendant with fraud or in the alternative embezzlement since the charges were in the alternative; nor were the concepts of included offenses, same evidence or merger.State v. Ortiz, 1977-NMCA-036, 90 N.M. 319, 563 P.2d 113.\n\nTrial de novo on alternative means of committing offense did not violate double jeopardy.— When a defendant is convicted based on one of two alternative means of committing a single crime, there is not an implied acquittal of the other alternative unless the conviction logically excludes guilt of the other alternative; if there is no implied acquittal, there is no constitutional prohibition against retrial of both alternatives after a conviction is set aside.State v. Ben, 2015-NMCA-118, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-011.\n\nWhere defendant was charged in magistrate court with multiple means of committing DWI, per se DWI and impaired to the slightest degree, and was convicted on the per se theory of DWI, defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated when he was retried de novo on the impaired theory in the district court, because his conviction on the per se theory of DWI was not logically inconsistent with a finding of impaired DWI.State v. Ben, 2015-NMCA-118, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-011.\n\nProsecution and forfeiture generally.—State v. Nunez, 2000-NMSC-013, 129 N.M. 63, 2 P.3d 264, does not stand for the proposition that a criminal prosecution may never advance independently of a forfeiture proceeding. Rather,Nunezappears to mandate only proper initiation of the dual penalty proceeding, meaning that the criminal charges and the forfeiture proceeding must be merged or consolidated prior to the occurrence of any event that signals the attachment of jeopardy.State v. Esparza, 2003-NMCA-075, 133 N.M. 772, 70 P.3d 762, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 771, 70 P.3d 761.\n\nCivil penalty and criminal prosecution under the Voter Action Act.— The civil penalty authorized under Section 1-19A-17 NMSA 1978 is remedial and does not constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes. The imposition of a civil penalty does not bar a subsequent criminal prosecution under the Voter Action Act for the same conduct for which the secretary of state assessed the civil penalty.State v. Block, 2011-NMCA-101, 150 N.M. 598, 263 P.3d 940.\n\nWhere the secretary of state assessed civil penalties against defendant for violations of the Voter Action Act and the attorney general subsequently filed criminal charges against defendant for the same violations of the act, the assessment of the civil penalties and the subsequent criminal prosecution did not violate double jeopardy.State v. Block, 2011-NMCA-101, 150 N.M. 598, 263 P.3d 940.\n\nCivil forfeiture under Controlled Substances Act.— Because civil forfeiture under the Controlled Substances Act is punishment for double-jeopardy purposes under the New Mexico constitution, all forfeiture complaints and criminal charges for violations of the Controlled Substances Act may both be brought only in a single, bifurcated proceeding.State v. Nunez, 2000-NMSC-013, 129 N.M. 63, 2 P.3d 264.\n\nThe legislature is not prevented from assessing both civil and criminal penalties for violations of the Controlled Substances Act, Sections 30-31-1 to 30-31-41 NMSA 1978.State v. Esparza, 2003-NMCA-075, 133 N.M. 772, 70 P.3d 762, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 771, 70 P.3d 761.\n\nCivil penalties and criminal prosecution under Securities Act.— Criminal prosecutions under the Securities Act, Sections 58-13B-1 to 58-13B-57 NMSA 1978 (now Sections 58-13C-101 to 58-13C-701 NMSA 1978), following administratively imposed civil penalties under that Act, do not place defendants in double jeopardy under N.M. Const., art. II, § 15, or under this section.State v. Kirby, 2003-NMCA-074, 133 N.M. 782, 70 P.3d 772, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 771, 70 P.3d 761.\n\nCity ordinance.— The clear intent and purpose of the city ordinance is to establish a remedial measure to protect the public from those drivers who persist in driving after license revocation and from multiple driving while intoxicated offenses; therefore, civil forfeiture proceedings are not punitive, and the drivers are not subjected to double jeopardy.City of Albuquerque ex rel. Albuquerque Police Dep't v. One (1) 1984 White Chevy UT., 2002-NMSC-014, 132 N.M. 187, 46 P.3d 94.\n\nTrial de novo after magistrate court conviction.— In a trial de novo resulting from a defendant's appeal of a magistrate court conviction, the district court has jurisdiction as well as a constitutional and statutory obligation to consider the defendant's pretrial double jeopardy claim.State v. Foster, 2003-NMCA-099, 134 N.M. 224, 75 P.3d 824, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 179, 74 P.3d 1071.\n\nGreater sentence after trial de novo.— The greater sentence imposed by the district court for violation of certain municipal ordinances after a trial de novo did not deprive defendant of due process, nor did it amount to double jeopardy.City of Farmington v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-022, 90 N.M. 246, 561 P.2d 945.\n\nDouble jeopardy was not violated by amendment of defendant's sentence.— Where the district court initially determined that defendant's 1972 uncounseled misdemeanor DWI conviction could not be used to enhance defendant's sentence for a 2009 aggravated DWI; the state asked the court to reconsider its ruling as a legal error six days after the court entered the sentence; the state did not present any new or supplemental evidence; the court determined that it had erred as a matter of law because defendant had not been sentenced to jail for the 1972 conviction; and the court amended defendant's sentence based on the legal error regarding the 1972 conviction, defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of finality in the original sentence because the state moved for reconsideration of the court's ruling on the validity of the 1972 sentence within the thirty days of the court's entry of the sentence and double jeopardy did not preclude the modification of defendant's sentence based on the legal error.State v. Redhouse, 2011-NMCA-118, 269 P.3d 8, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-011.\n\nLarceny of cattle distinct from disposition of hides.— Larceny of cattle, completed on one day by driving the cattle away or killing them with intent to steal, was a distinct offense from that of killing cattle and failing to keep the hides and an acquittal of former was no bar to prosecution for latter.State v. Knight, 1929-NMSC-049, 34 N.M. 217, 279 P. 947.\n\nConspiracy and completed offense are separate offensesand conviction of both does not amount to double jeopardy.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-126, 90 N.M. 12, 558 P.2d 1151.\n\nThe commission of a substantive offense and a conspiracy to commit it are separate and distinct offenses, and a conviction for the conspiracy may be had though the substantive offense was completed. The plea of double jeopardy is not a defense to conviction for both offenses.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-126, 90 N.M. 12, 558 P.2d 1151.\n\nEvidence that a conspiracy to commit burglary was entered on the evening of November 16th, that the conspirators unsuccessfully attempted to carry out the conspiracy at 10:30 p.m. of that day, and that the burglary was performed between 9:00 and 9:30 a.m. of November 17th, showed two distinct crimes, and there was no factual basis for the contention that they were either the same or so similar that multiple convictions were prohibited.State v. Watkins, 1975-NMCA-126, 88 N.M. 561, 543 P.2d 1189, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71.\n\nDouble use of prior felony.— It is not legally permissible for the state to present evidence of the same prior felony to prove an essential element of the crime of felon in possession of a firearm, and to rely upon this same evidence for purposes of enhancing the defendants' sentences under the habitual offender criminal statute.State v. Haddenham, 1990-NMCA-048, 110 N.M. 149, 793 P.2d 279, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 72, 792 P.2d 49, and 110 N.M. 183, 793 P.2d 865.\n\nA. LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE.\n\nEffect of conviction or acquittal of lesser included offense.— Conviction or acquittal of a lesser offense necessarily included in a greater offense bars a subsequent prosecution for the greater offense.State v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-026, 90 N.M. 260, 561 P.2d 1353, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nMeaning of included offense.— For an offense to be included within another offense, the offense must be necessarily included in the offense charged in the indictment, and for an offense to be necessarily included, the greater offense cannot be committed without also committing the lesser.State v. Kraul, 1977-NMCA-032, 90 N.M. 314, 563 P.2d 108, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nIndictment source for determining lesser offense.— For a lesser offense to be necessarily included, the greater offense cannot be committed without also committing the lesser, and in determining whether an offense is necessarily included, the court will look to the offense charged in the indictment.State v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-026, 90 N.M. 260, 561 P.2d 1353, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nException to rule.— Conviction of a lesser included offense bars prosecution of a greater offense, subject to one exception: if the court does not have jurisdiction to try the crime, double jeopardy cannot attach, since double jeopardy requires that a court have sufficient jurisdiction to try the charge. Where the magistrate court had no jurisdiction to try the charge of vehicular homicide while driving while intoxicated or recklessly driving, double jeopardy should not bar the vehicular homicide by driving while intoxicated charge.State v. Tanton, 1975-NMSC-057, 88 N.M. 333, 540 P.2d 813.\n\nArmed robbery and aggravated battery.— The concept of lesser included offenses is not involved in a prosecution for armed robbery and aggravated battery because either offense can be committed without committing the other offense.State v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-026, 90 N.M. 260, 561 P.2d 1353, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nAggravated burglary involving battery and aggravated battery involving deadly weapon.— Where defendant entered the victims' home with intent to commit theft and stabbed and beat the victims, defendant's convictions of aggravated burglary involving battery and aggravated burglary involving a deadly weapon did not violate double jeopardy.State v. Swick, 2010-NMCA-098, 148 N.M. 895, 242 P.3d 462, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-010, 149 N.M. 64, 243 P.3d 1146.\n\nDriving under the influence and homicide by vehicle.— Where the indictment against defendant was phrased in the alternative charging him with homicide by vehicle (former Section 64-22-1, 1953 Comp.) while violating either Section 64-22-2, 1953 Comp.(former driving under the influence) or Section 64-22-3, 1953 Comp. (former reckless driving), the prosecution was not barred by a conviction in municipal court for driving under the influence since the lesser offense of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor is not necessarily included in the greater offense of homicide by vehicle.State v. Tanton, 1975-NMSC-057, 88 N.M. 333, 540 P.2d 813.\n\nPossession and distribution.— Possession of marijuana was a lesser offense necessarily included in the greater offense of distribution, arising out of the same events, and since defendant was convicted of the lesser offense, double jeopardy barred his prosecution for the greater.State v. Medina, 1975-NMCA-033, 87 N.M. 394, 534 P.2d 486.\n\nCriminal sexual contact of minor and attempted criminal sexual penetration.— The offenses of criminal sexual contact of a minor and attempted criminal sexual penetration of a minor cannot be characterized as lesser included and greater inclusive crimes because they each contain different elements and stand independently in relation to one another.State v. Mora, 2003-NMCA-072, 133 N.M. 746, 69 P.3d 256, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 727, 69 P.3d 237.\n\nB. SAME EVIDENCE.\n\nNature of test.— The test for determining whether two offenses are the same so as to bring into operation the prohibition against double jeopardy is the \"same evidence\" test which asks whether the facts offered in support of one offense would sustain a conviction of the other.State v. Tanton, 1975-NMSC-057, 88 N.M. 333, 540 P.2d 813;Owens v. Abram, 1954-NMSC-096, 58 N.M. 682, 274 P.2d 630, cert. denied, 348 U.S. 917, 75 S. Ct. 300, 99 L. Ed. 719 (1955).\n\nSame evidence test.— The \"same evidence\" test is whether the facts offered in support of one offense would sustain a conviction of the other offense.State v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-026, 90 N.M. 260, 561 P.2d 1353, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nUnitary test.— Where a defendant convicted of multiple offenses claims double jeopardy, a reviewing court first determines whether defendant's conduct was unitary in nature so that the same acts were used to prove both offenses; where the conduct is unitary, the court must then examine the statutes in question to determine whether the legislature intended that multiple punishments could be imposed for different criminal offenses resulting from the same conduct.State v. Duran, 1998-NMCA-153, 126 N.M. 60, 966 P.2d 768, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 533, 972 P.2d 352,overruled on other grounds,State v. Laguna, 1999-NMCA-152, 128 N.M. 345, 992 P.2d 896, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 149, 990 P.2d 823.\n\nProof of different facts.— If either information requires the proof of facts to support a conviction which the other does not, the offenses are not the same and a plea of double jeopardy is unavailing.State v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-026, 90 N.M. 260, 561 P.2d 1353, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486;Owens v. Abram, 1954-NMSC-096, 58 N.M. 682, 274 P.2d 630, cert. denied, 348 U.S. 917, 75 S. Ct. 300, 99 L. Ed. 719 (1955).\n\nIf test met, section does not bar consecutive sentencing.— Under the \"same evidence\" test, where different elements are required to be proved in order to sustain each of three convictions, and different evidence is admitted to prove the different elements, it appears that the three convictions are based in part on separate evidence and the prohibition against double jeopardy does not bar consecutive sentencing under the circumstances of the case.State v. Manus, 1979-NMSC-035, 93 N.M. 95, 597 P.2d 280,overruled on other grounds bySells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nHarassment and stalking.— Where the state relies on identical acts of an accused involving the same course of conduct to prove both the offenses of harassment and of stalking, double jeopardy provisions preclude multiple punishment, and the offense of harassment is subsumed into the offense of misdemeanor stalking.State v. Duran, 1998-NMCA-153, 126 N.M. 60, 966 P.2d 768, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 533, 972 P.2d 352,overruled on other grounds byState v. Laguna, 1999-NMCA-152, 128 N.M. 345, 992 P.2d 896, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 149, 990 P.2d 823.\n\nFelony murder and armed robbery are separate offenses,although they may arise out of the same transaction.State v. Martinez, 1981-NMSC-016, 95 N.M. 421, 622 P.2d 1041.\n\nArmed robbery and aggravated battery.— Since taking the victim's purse was a fact required to be proved under the armed robbery charge, but not under the aggravated battery charge, and application of force was a fact required to be proved under the aggravated battery charge, while threatened use of force would be acceptable proof under the armed robbery charge, the elements of the two crimes were not the same, and the \"same evidence\" test did not apply.State v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-026, 90 N.M. 260, 561 P.2d 1353, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nArmed robbery and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.— Where defendant was convicted of armed robbery, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, false imprisonment, possession of a firearm by a felon, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, based on evidence that defendant, armed with a firearm, robbed a restaurant in Alamogordo, New Mexico, defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy was violated where the evidence established that the force elements for both armed robbery and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon were satisfied simultaneously and the jury was instructed that it could rely on the same conduct to satisfy the force elements of both armed robbery and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Defendant's conviction for aggravated battery was therefore subsumed by his armed robbery conviction.State v. Reed, 2022-NMCA-025, cert. denied.\n\nArmed robbery and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.— Where defendant was convicted of armed robbery, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, false imprisonment, possession of a firearm by a felon, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, based on evidence that defendant, armed with a firearm, robbed a restaurant in Alamogordo, New Mexico, defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy was violated where the use of force against the victim for the aggravated assault with a deadly weapon conviction was the same use of force as that relied upon for the armed robbery conviction, and the actions needed to effectuate aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, as charged in this case, did not require anything more of defendant than the actions necessary to effectuate armed robbery. Defendant's conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon was subsumed by his armed robbery conviction.State v. Reed, 2022-NMCA-025, cert. denied.\n\nArmed robbery and false imprisonment.— Where defendant was convicted of armed robbery, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, false imprisonment, possession of a firearm by a felon, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, based on evidence that defendant, armed with a firearm, robbed a restaurant in Alamogordo, New Mexico, defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy was violated where the State argued before the jury that it could rely on pointing a gun at the victim or pressing a gun to her throat as the basis for the \"force or violence or threatened force or violence\" necessary for armed robbery and \"the force or intimidation\" necessary for the false imprisonment, and where the elements of false imprisonment were subsumed by the elements of armed robbery because nothing more was required of defendant to complete false imprisonment than was required for his commission of armed robbery.State v. Reed, 2022-NMCA-025, cert. denied.\n\nDrunk driving and homicide by vehicle.— Where the facts offered in municipal court to support a conviction for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquors would not necessarily sustain a conviction for homicide by vehicle in district court, under the \"same evidence\" test there was no double jeopardy when the state sought to prosecute the defendant for homicide by vehicle.State v. Tanton, 1975-NMSC-057, 88 N.M. 333, 540 P.2d 813.\n\nC. MERGER, COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL AND SAME TRANSACTION.\n\nDefinition of merger.— Merger is the name applied to the concept of multiple punishment when multiple charges are brought in a single trial; it is an aspect of double jeopardy, concerned with whether more than one offense has occurred and is applied to prevent a person from being punished twice for the same offense.State v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-026, 90 N.M. 260, 561 P.2d 1353, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nNature of test.— The test of whether one criminal offense has merged in another is not whether two criminal acts are successive steps in the same transaction (the rejected \"same transaction\" test), but whether one offense necessarily involves the other.State v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-026, 90 N.M. 260, 561 P.2d 1353, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nFactors considered.— In determining whether the defendant's acts constituted a single offense or multiple offenses for purposes of double jeopardy, factors considered include the time between the acts, the location of the victim at the time of each act, the existence of any intervening event, distinctions in the manner of committing the acts, the defendant's intent, and the number of victims.State v. Handa, 1995-NMCA-042, 120 N.M. 38, 897 P.2d 225, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 771, 895 P.2d 671.\n\nMerger concept has aspects of \"same evidence\" testbecause merger and the \"same evidence\" test are both concerned with whether more than one offense has been committed.State v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-026, 90 N.M. 260, 561 P.2d 1353, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nMerger has aspects of included offense concept.— The merger concept has aspects of the included offense concept, and in determining whether one offense necessarily involves another offense so that merger applies, the decisions have looked to the definitions of the crimes to see whether the elements are the same; this approach is similar to the approach used in determining whether an offense is an included offense (a determination of whether the greater offense can be committed without also committing the lesser).State v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-026, 90 N.M. 260, 561 P.2d 1353, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nOffense of aggravated battery did not merge with armed robbery.State v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-026, 90 N.M. 260, 561 P.2d 1353, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nHomicide.— Homicide resulting from great bodily harm was sufficient evidence for the jury to find aggravated sodomy and first degree kidnapping, and there was no merger with the murder charge on which defendant was acquitted.State v. Melton, 1977-NMSC-014, 90 N.M. 188, 561 P.2d 461.\n\nAssault.— An assault arising from a series of three successive shots fired at a single victim, not separated by a significant amount of time, and arising from a single, continuous intent constituted one offense, and conviction of the defendant on two counts of assault violated his double jeopardy rights.State v. Handa, 1995-NMCA-042, 120 N.M. 38, 897 P.2d 225, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 771, 895 P.2d 671.\n\nDefinition of collateral estoppel.— Collateral estoppel means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.State v. Nagel, 1975-NMCA-026, 87 N.M. 434, 535 P.2d 641, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 450, 535 P.2d 657.\n\nUnder the rule of collateral estoppel any right, fact or matter in issue, and directly adjudicated upon, or necessarily involved in, the determination of an action before a competent court in which a judgment or decree is rendered upon the merits is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the parties and privies whether the claim or demand, purpose or subject matter of the two suits is the same or not.State v. Nagel, 1975-NMCA-026, 87 N.M. 434, 535 P.2d 641, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 450, 535 P.2d 657.\n\nPart of constitutional guarantee.— The principle of collateral estoppel is embodied in the U.S. Const., amend. V guaranty against double jeopardy and is fully applicable to states by force of U.S. Const., amend. XIV.State v. Nagel, 1975-NMCA-026, 87 N.M. 434, 535 P.2d 641, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 450, 535 P.2d 657.\n\nWhen constitutionally required.— The principle of collateral estoppel is only constitutionally required after a previous acquittal on issues raised in a second prosecution, and bars relitigation between the same parties of issues actually determined at the previous trial.State v. Tanton, 1975-NMSC-057, 88 N.M. 333, 540 P.2d 813.\n\nDouble use of conditional discharge.— Use of the defendant's prior conditional discharge to prove that he was a felon in order to convict him of the crime of felon in possession of a firearm and to enhance his sentence for underlying assault convictions did not violate his double jeopardy rights.State v. Handa, 1995-NMCA-042, 120 N.M. 38, 897 P.2d 225, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 771, 895 P.2d 671.\n\nSanity during commission of different crimes.— Where defendant's sanity was raised as an affirmative defense in a first trial, was actually litigated and was absolutely necessary to a decision in that trial, the sanity of the defendant in a second trial for offenses committed some 16 hours prior to the crime which was the subject of the first trial was the same issue of fact as the question of his insanity at the first trial and having been decided there in his favor collateral estoppel was a bar to the second trial.State v. Nagel, 1975-NMCA-026, 87 N.M. 434, 535 P.2d 641, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 450, 535 P.2d 657.\n\nTraffic violations and homicide by vehicle.— Where defendant was convicted in municipal court of violation of certain traffic ordinances, he had no acquittal to raise in his defense in district court on charges of homicide by vehicle, and application of the principle of collateral estoppel was therefore inappropriate.State v. Tanton, 1975-NMSC-057, 88 N.M. 333, 540 P.2d 813.\n\nSame transaction test rejected.— The \"same transaction\" test, which is concerned with whether offenses were committed at the same time, were part of a continuous criminal act and inspired by the same criminal intent, has not been imposed by the United States supreme court on the states in double jeopardy cases, and its use is not mandated by N.M. Const., art. II, § 15. It is rejected and disapproved.State v. Tanton, 1975-NMSC-057, 88 N.M. 333, 540 P.2d 813.\n\nIII. MISTRIAL.\n\nManifest necessity.— Where a mistrial is granted not at the behest of defendant, a second trial is precluded by the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Const., amend. V unless it can be said that there was a \"manifest necessity\" or \" compelling reason\" for the granting of a mistrial. Upon appellate review, the question to be decided is whether the trial court exercised sound judicial discretion to ascertain that there was a manifest necessity for the declaration of the mistrial.State v. Sedillo, 1975-NMCA-089, 88 N.M. 240, 539 P.2d 630.\n\nBasis of manifest necessity.— The court of appeals would decline to hold there was a manifest necessity for a mistrial based on the state's supposedly prejudiced right to appeal when no appeal was attempted.State v. Aragon, 1976-NMCA-018, 89 N.M. 91, 547 P.2d 574, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 206, 549 P.2d 284,overruled byState v. Rickerson, 1981-NMSC-036, 95 N.M. 666, 625 P.2d 1183.\n\nEnds of public justice.— In determining whether a mistrial should be declared, the trial court must consider whether the ends of public justice would be defeated by carrying the first trial to a final verdict; this consideration for the ends of public justice is a concept separate from manifest necessity.State v. Aragon, 1976-NMCA-018, 89 N.M. 91, 547 P.2d 574, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 206, 549 P.2d 284,overruled byState v. Rickerson, 1981-NMSC-036, 95 N.M. 666, 625 P.2d 1183.\n\nPrejudice to state.— The failure of defendant to file a timely motion to suppress his statement resulted in prejudice to the state, and since in such circumstances it would be contrary to the ends of public justice to carry the first trial to a final verdict, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declaring a mistrial; there was no double jeopardy.State v. Aragon, 1976-NMCA-018, 89 N.M. 91, 547 P.2d 574, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 206, 549 P.2d 284,overruled byState v. Rickerson, 1981-NMSC-036, 95 N.M. 666, 625 P.2d 1183.\n\nNeed for responsible professional conduct.— In considering whether a mistrial was proper unquestionably an important factor to be considered is the need to hold litigants on both sides to standards of responsible professional conduct in the clash of an adversary criminal process.State v. Aragon, 1976-NMCA-018, 89 N.M. 91, 547 P.2d 574, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 206, 549 P.2d 284,overruled byState v. Rickerson, 1981-NMSC-036, 95 N.M. 666, 625 P.2d 1183.\n\nFurther interests of defendant.— In determining whether a defendant's retrial will place him in double jeopardy after a prior trial has ended with a declaration of a mistrial not at defendant's request include defendant's interest in having his fate determined by the jury first impaneled, which encompasses not only his right to have his trial completed by a particular panel, but also his interest in ending the dispute then and there with an acquittal, which factor would weigh heavily against retrial in all situations where jeopardy has attached, and also the factor of avoiding giving the state a second bite of the apple in order to either strengthen its case or to alter its trial strategy to obtain a conviction.State v. C. De Baca, 1975-NMCA-120, 88 N.M. 454, 541 P.2d 634, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71.\n\nDiscretion of trial court.— The law has invested courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated; they are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject, and it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere, but the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes.State v. C. De Baca, 1975-NMCA-120, 88 N.M. 454, 541 P.2d 634, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71.\n\nUpon appellate review of the declaration of a mistrial the question is whether the trial court exercised a sound discretion to ascertain that there was a manifest necessity for a mistrial.State v. C. De Baca, 1975-NMCA-120, 88 N.M. 454, 541 P.2d 634, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71.\n\nMistrial on abuse of discretion.— Where, after the second day of a trial, when jury instructions had already been settled, one of the jurors was frightened by a telephone call unrelated to the trial, and exploring her possible bias for use on voir dire in a future case, and the record did not show that the juror's fear involved either the state or the defendant, the trial court failed to exercise that sound discretion required of him in determining whether a manifest necessity or proper judicial administration mandated a mistrial.State v. C. De Baca, 1975-NMCA-120, 88 N.M. 454, 541 P.2d 634, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71.\n\nDuty of court before declaring mistrial.— Where there is no manifest necessity for declaring a mistrial, the trial court has some duty to inquire as to possible alternatives thereto; affecting the scope of inquiry required are the factors of magnitude of prejudice and the point at which the proceedings are terminated, and as the magnitude of possible prejudice increases, less effort need be expended in seeking alternative resolutions, while conversely, as the length of trial wears on, more effort should be expended.State v. C. De Baca, 1975-NMCA-120, 88 N.M. 454, 541 P.2d 634, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71.\n\nFailure to oppose mistrial.— Defense counsel's silence after declaration of a mistrial by the trial court, sua sponte, where simultaneously the defense attorney himself had been held in contempt for implicitly challenging a police officer on recross-examination to take a polygraph test, could not, under the circumstances, be construed as an intentional relinquishment of a known right, the right against double jeopardy, or as the mere play of wits of the sharp practitioner.State v. Sedillo, 1975-NMCA-089, 88 N.M. 240, 539 P.2d 630.\n\nRetrial after mistrial.— Two considerations must be balanced against the weighty interests of the defendant against retrial after declaration of a mistrial not at his request, namely, whether there was a manifest necessity for the discharge of the first jury, and also whether the ends of public justice would have been defeated by carrying the first trial to final verdict. When the irregularity occurring at trial is of a procedural nature, not rising to the level of jurisdictional error, the necessity to discharge the jury has been held to be not manifest, but where the irregularity involves possible partiality within the jury, it has been more often held that the public interest in fair verdicts outweighs defendant's interest in obtaining a verdict by his first choice of jury.State v. C. De Baca, 1975-NMCA-120, 88 N.M. 454, 541 P.2d 634, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71. A retrial after a mistrial is not barred by double jeopardy unless the mistrial was caused by prosecutorial overreaching.State v. Mazurek, 1975-NMCA-066, 88 N.M. 56, 537 P.2d 51.\n\nRetrial prohibited for prosecutorial misconduct.— Retrial is barred when improper official conduct is so unfairly prejudicial that it cannot be cured by means short of a mistrial or a motion for a new trial, and the official knows that the conduct is improper and prejudicial and the official either intends to provoke a mistrial or acts in willful disregard of the resulting mistrial, retrial, or reversal.State v. Breit, 1996-NMSC-067, 122 N.M. 655, 930 P.2d 792.\n\nProsecutorial misconduct not bar to retrial.— Double jeopardy did not bar reprosecution where a mistrial was declared on motion of defendants for the prosecutor's discovery abuses because the defendants failed to show why any prejudice resulting from the prosecutor's late disclosure could not have been cured by a remedy short of a mistrial.State v. Lucero, 1999-NMCA-102, 127 N.M. 672, 986 P.2d 468, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 149, 990 P.2d 823.\n\nTo bar a retrial on double jeopardy grounds, the misconduct must be extraordinary.— Where defendant was charged with multiple crimes following a two-vehicle collision, including homicide by vehicle, great bodily harm by vehicle, driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, and reckless driving, and where, prior to trial, the district court judge specifically excluded by motion in limine hearsay testimony that defendant had confessed to another officer about being behind the wheel at the time of the accident, and where, at trial, the officer failed to adhere to the court's admonishment, double jeopardy did not bar a retrial where it was the state's witness, not the prosecutor, that injected the precluded testimony into the trial, and where there was no evidence that the prosecutor intentionally elicited testimony about the purported confession that had been suppressed.State v. Hernandez, 2017-NMCA-020, cert. denied.\n\nMistrial on one of two separate charges.— Since the defendant was charged with attempted murder and aggravated battery and was convicted of aggravated battery, and since the two offenses were in separate counts and the jury was not instructed that it could convict on only one offense, its inability to return a verdict on the attempted murder charge was not an implicit acquittal and the state was not barred from pursuing an attempted murder charge on remand.State v. Martinez, 1995-NMSC-064, 120 N.M. 677, 905 P.2d 715.\n\nReprosecution after unnecessary mistrial.— Defense counsel's implicit challenge to a police officer to take a polygraph test, absent repeated misconduct, was not a type of misconduct that would go to the very vitals of the trial itself, and hence, where the trial judge sua sponte declared a mistrial, having made no effort to cure the error or to assure that there was manifest necessity for such a step, reprosecution of the defendant would violate his right under the U.S. Const., amend. V not to be put in jeopardy twice for the same offense.State v. Sedillo, 1975-NMCA-089, 88 N.M. 240, 539 P.2d 630.\n\nIV. RAISING THE DEFENSE.\n\nEstoppel.— An accused is estopped at a second trial to plead the bar of a prior conviction, judgment and sentence of which have been reversed on appeal.State v. Sneed, 1967-NMSC-272, 78 N.M. 615, 435 P.2d 768.\n\nFactual basis must appear in recordin order to support a double jeopardy defense.State v. Wood, 1994-NMCA-060, 117 N.M. 682, 875 P.2d 1113, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 744, 877 P.2d 44.\n\nDefendants could raise their state-based double jeopardy claim for the first time on appeal, provided the factual basis for the state constitutional argument could be found in the record of proceedings below.State v. Lucero, 1999-NMCA-102, 127 N.M. 672, 986 P.2d 468, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 149, 990 P.2d 823.\n\nRaising issue on appeal despite failure to object below.— Even though defendant made no objection at second trial (held after remand of initial trial which had resulted in verdict of first degree murder with recommendation of clemency) to instruction that the jury could find defendant guilty of murder in the first degree and might or might not recommend clemency, the question of whether this constituted double jeopardy could nevertheless be raised on appeal.State v. Sneed, 1967-NMSC-272, 78 N.M. 615, 435 P.2d 768.\n\nDefendant's argument that the state split one criminal defense into five separate prosecutions and that his convictions were not authorized by the legislature under the statute prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law amounted to a defense of double jeopardy which the defendant could raise for the first time on appeal.State v. Edwards, 1984-NMCA-070, 102 N.M. 413, 696 P.2d 1006, cert. quashed, 102 N.M. 412, 696 P.2d 1005 (1985).\n\nThe defense of double jeopardy may be raised on appeal even though the defendant failed to argue that issue in the court below.State v. Riley, 2010-NMSC-005, 147 N.M. 557, 226 P.3d 656;State v. Jensen, 1998-NMCA-034, 124 N.M. 726, 955 P.2d 195.\n\nDefendant may raise a double jeopardy challenge on appeal regardless of preservation.State v. Rodriguez, 2004-NMCA-125, 136 N.M. 494, 100 P.3d 200, cert. granted, 2004-NMCERT-010, 136 N.M. 542, 101 P.3d 808,rev'd, 2006-NMSC-018, 139 N.M. 450, 134 P.3d 737.\n\nGuilty plea not bar to raising issue on appeal.— The defendant was not barred by pleading guilty to two counts in a three count indictment, which contained identical language for all three counts including the name of the victim, from raising the double jeopardy claim on appeal.State v. Handa, 1995-NMCA-042, 120 N.M. 38, 897 P.2d 225, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 771, 895 P.2d 671.\n\nLaw of case doctrine not bar.— When a trial court's decision that double jeopardy barred reprosecution of defendant was reversed by the court of appeals, the law of the case doctrine did not bar consideration of the double jeopardy issue on appeal of the defendant's conviction at the second trial.State v. Breit, 1996-NMSC-067, 122 N.M. 655, 930 P.2d 792.\n\nWaiver of defense.— Plea of former jeopardy must be interposed at the earliest opportunity, otherwise it is waived; it cannot be raised for first time after verdict.State v. Mares, 1921-NMSC-048, 27 N.M. 212, 199 P. 111 (decided under prior law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For survey of 1990-91 criminal procedure and evidence, see 22 N.M.L.

      "text": "No person indicted or charged by information or complaint of any crime shall be sentenced therefor, unless he has been legally convicted of the crime in a court having competent jurisdiction of the cause and of the person. No person shall be convicted of a crime unless found guilty by the verdict of the jury, accepted and recorded by the court; or upon the defendant's confession of guilt or a plea of nolo contendere, accepted and recorded in open court; or after trial to the court without jury and the finding by the court that such defendant is guilty of the crime for which he is charged.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-1-11, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 1-11.\n\nCross references.— For constitutional right to trial by jury,seeN.M. Const., art. II, §§ 12 and 14.\n\nFor arraignment and plea procedure,seeRules 5-303 and 5-304 NMRA.\n\nFor right to jury trial, and waiver of same,seeRule 5-605 NMRA.\n\nConviction refers to finding of guilt and does not include imposition of sentence.State v. Garcia, 1983-NMCA-017, 99 N.M. 466, 659 P.2d 918.\n\nTo justify conviction evidence must establish every essential elementof the offense charged, and whatever is essential must affirmatively appear from the record.State v. Losolla, 1972-NMCA-085, 84 N.M. 151, 500 P.2d 436.\n\nGuilty pleas authorized.— The power of a court to accept a plea of guilty is traditional and fundamental and specifically authorized by this section.State v. Daniels, 1968-NMSC-039, 78 N.M. 768, 438 P.2d 512.\n\nWaiver of jury permissible.— Though charged with a felony, a defendant may waive a trial by jury.State v. Hernandez, 1942-NMSC-010, 46 N.M. 134, 123 P.2d 387.\n\nGuilty plea as waiver of rights, defenses.— By pleading guilty the defendant admitted the acts well pleaded in the charge, waived all defenses other than that the indictment or information charges no offense, and waived the right to trial and the incidents thereof, and the constitutional guarantees with respect to the conduct of criminal prosecutions, including right to jury trial, right to counsel subsequent to guilty plea and right to remain silent.State v. Daniels, 1968-NMSC-039, 78 N.M. 768, 438 P.2d 512.\n\nWithdrawal of guilty plea appropriate where defendant was not properly advised of the nature of the charges.— Where the state filed three criminal informations against defendant, each of which charged defendant with fraud and embezzlement against separate victims, and where defendant and the state entered into plea agreements under which defendant agreed to plead guilty to the fraud and embezzlement charges in all three cases, and where, during the change of plea hearing, defendant stated that he understood the charges to which he was pleading and acknowledged that the state had some evidence to prove his guilt of all the charges in all three cases, and where, following the district court's acceptance of the guilty pleas in all three cases and sentencing defendant to twenty-one years imprisonment, defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming that he did not understand the basis for his fraud and embezzlement convictions, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, because defendant did not knowingly and voluntarily plead guilty. The district court accepted defendant's guilty pleas without providing him with any explanation of the charges to which he pleaded guilty, much less an explanation of how his conduct in each case satisfied the essential elements of both fraud and embezzlement, which under the circumstances of this case were mutually exclusive because the same conduct cannot satisfy the essential elements of both fraud and embezzlement.State v. Yancey, 2021-NMCA-009, cert. denied.\n\nJudgment and sentence entered pursuant to a plea agreement is void in the absence of an express guilty plea on the record.— Where defendant was charged with three counts of fraud, three counts of embezzlement and two counts of racketeering in three separate criminal complaints, and where defendant made a separate plea agreement in each case, and where at the plea hearing on all three complaints, the district court complied with the prerequisites set forth in Rules 5-303 and 5-304 NMRA, ensuring that the proposed guilty plea was voluntary and intelligent, but where the district court never specifically asked defendant to plead, and defendant never expressly admitted his guilt to anything in open court on the record in the hearing, the district court was without authority to sentence defendant, because in the absence of an express guilty plea on the record, a judgment and sentence that is entered pursuant to the plea agreement is void.State v. Yancey, 2017-NMCA-090, cert. granted.\n\nGuilty plea as confession to charge.— Where appellant admittedly incriminated himself by his plea of guilty, he could not be heard to complain since by his plea he confessed the charge contained in the information.State v. Daniels, 1968-NMSC-039, 78 N.M. 768, 438 P.2d 512.\n\nExpress adjudication of conviction or finding of guilt is not necessary ifit is apparent from other matters in the record that the court made a judicial determination of conviction or guilt.State v. Gallegos, 1978-NMCA-114, 92 N.M. 370, 588 P.2d 1045, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 353, 588 P.2d 554.\n\nSafeguards in admitting confession.— Before a confession may be admitted into evidence it should first be determined by the court, on an inquiry out of the presence of the jury, and as a preliminary matter, that the confession, prima facie at least, possesses all the earmarks of voluntariness.State v. Armijo, 1958-NMSC-108, 64 N.M. 431, 329 P.2d 785.\n\nState must overcome evidence of excuse or justificationin the form of tangible affirmative defensive or factual matter capable of specific disproof included in a confession or admission.State v. Casaus, 1963-NMSC-194, 73 N.M. 152, 386 P.2d 246.\n\nDefendant to be heard on integrity of confession.— Any time a defendant makes it known that he has something to say touching the integrity of a confession claimed to have been made by him, however incredible it may appear to the trial court, the judge must hear him. In declining to do so, the court committed reversible error.State v. Armijo, 1958-NMSC-108, 64 N.M. 431, 329 P.2d 785.\n\nPlea of nolo contendere with deferred sentence.— Where defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere, which was accepted and defendant's counsel after conferring with defendant made an explanation to the court about defendant feeling sorry for what he had done, there can be no real doubt from what was said and recorded at the arraignment proceedings, from the entry of the \"judgment and sentence,\" and from the entry of the \"order of probation\" that the court and defendant both understood that defendant's plea had been accepted, that defendant had been adjudged guilty of the charge on the basis of this plea, that his sentence for the offense was being deferred and that he was being placed on probation for two years upon certain expressly recited conditions.State v. Apodaca, 1969-NMCA-020, 80 N.M. 155, 452 P.2d 489.\n\nProcedural irregularities not constitutionally significant.— Where defendant's attorney pleaded guilty for the defendant, who was present, after plea bargaining, the fact that the defendant himself did not enter the plea, that the court did not inquire whether the plea was made voluntarily and that the plea was not accepted and recorded in open court, as required by this section, did not deprive defendant of due process or raise any constitutional questions for federal habeas corpus review.Anaya v. Rodriguez, 372 F.2d 683 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 863, 88 S. Ct. 123, 19 L. Ed. 2d 133 (1967).\n\nMisuse of word in verdict not jurisdictional.— Since the trial court unquestionably had jurisdiction over the person of defendant and over the subject matter of the offense charged, the inadvertent use of the word \"information\" in the jury's verdict did not raise a jurisdictional question.State v. Ortega, 1968-NMCA-097, 79 N.M. 744, 449 P.2d 346.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 21 Am.

      "text": "As used in the Criminal Code:\n\nA. \"great bodily harm\" means an injury to the person which creates a high probability of death; or which causes serious disfigurement; or which results in permanent or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any member or organ of the body;\n\nB. \"deadly weapon\" means any firearm, whether loaded or unloaded; or any weapon which is capable of producing death or great bodily harm, including but not restricted to any types of daggers, brass knuckles, switchblade knives, bowie knives, poniards, butcher knives, dirk knives and all such weapons with which dangerous cuts can be given, or with which dangerous thrusts can be inflicted, including swordcanes, and any kind of sharp pointed canes, also slingshots, slung shots, bludgeons; or any other weapons with which dangerous wounds can be inflicted;\n\nC. \"peace officer\" means any public official or public officer vested by law with a duty to maintain public order or to make arrests for crime, whether that duty extends to all crimes or is limited to specific crimes;\n\nD. \"another\" or \"other\" means any other human being or legal entity, whether incorporated or unincorporated, including the United States, the state of New Mexico or any subdivision thereof;\n\nE. \"person\" means any human being or legal entity, whether incorporated or unincorporated, including the United States, the state of New Mexico or any subdivision thereof;\n\nF. \"anything of value\" means any conceivable thing of the slightest value, tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, corporeal or incorporeal, public or private. The term is not necessarily synonymous with the traditional legal term \"property\";\n\nG. \"official proceeding\" means a proceeding heard before any legislative, judicial, administrative or other governmental agency or official authorized to hear evidence under oath, including any referee, hearing examiner, commissioner, notary or other person taking testimony or depositions in any proceeding;\n\nH. \"lawful custody or confinement\" means the holding of any person pursuant to lawful authority, including, without limitation, actual or conseructive [constructive] custody of prisoners temporarily outside a penal institution, reformatory, jail, prison farm or ranch;\n\nI. \"public officer\" means any elected or appointed officer of the state or any of its political subdivisions, and whether or not he receives remuneration for his services; and\n\nJ. \"public employee\" means any person receiving remuneration for regular services rendered to the state or any of its political subdivisions.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-1-13, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 1-13.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nFurlough as \"lawful custody or confinement\".— Where, after defendant began serving a sentence for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, the metropolitan court released defendant on furlough and the furlough order imposed limitations on defendant's movement, required defendant to return to custody at the end of the furlough period, and informed defendant that failure to return would result in a charge of escape, Defendant continued to serve the sentence while on furlough because defendant was in \"lawful custody or confinement\" while on furlough and defendant was entitled to credit for the time defendant was on furlough.State v. Padilla, 2011-NMCA-029, 150 N.M. 344, 258 P.3d 1136.\n\nGreat bodily harm: evidence that injury has actually caused deathmay be used to demonstrate the element of great bodily harm because, consistent with Subsection A of this section, it establishes an injury that creates a high probability of death.State v. Dominguez, 2005-NMSC-001, 137 N.M. 1, 106 P.3d 563.\n\nGreat bodily harm: death not equated with great bodily harm.— Comparing the voluntary manslaughter statute with the shooting at or from a motor vehicle statute and the statutory definition of great bodily harm in Subsection A of Section 30-1-12 NMSA 1978, it is clear that the legislature does not \"equate\" death with great bodily harm.State v. Dominguez, 2005-NMSC-001, 137 N.M. 1, 106 P.3d 563.\n\nGreat bodily harm: construction with other laws.— Section 30-3-8A NMSA 1978, construed with the definition of \"great bodily harm\" in Subsection A, includes a shooting at a dwelling that results in death.State v. Varela, 1999-NMSC-045, 128 N.M. 454, 993 P.2d 1280.\n\nGreat bodily harm: protracted impairment.— Section 66-8-101B NMSA 1978, which defines great bodily injury by a motor vehicle as \"the injuring of a human being, to the extent defined in Section 30-1-12 NMSA 1978, in the unlawful operation of a motor vehicle,\" is not unconstitutionally vague. The term \"protracted impairment\" in Section 30-1-12A NMSA 1978 is capable of reasonable application by a jury of common intelligence after consideration of the circumstances involved.State v. Jim, 1988-NMCA-092, 107 N.M. 779, 765 P.2d 195, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 720, 764 P.2d 491.\n\nGreat bodily harm: serious disfigurement.— Under this section, the word \"disfigurement\" has no technical meaning and should be considered in the ordinary sense, as should the word \"serious.\"State v. Ortega, 1966-NMSC-186, 77 N.M. 312, 422 P.2d 353.\n\nGreat bodily harm: high probability of death.— Sheriff's description of being choked by defendant was evidence that the choking created a \"high probability of death\", which is one part of the definition of great bodily harm.State v. Hollowell, 1969-NMCA-105, 80 N.M. 756, 461 P.2d 238.\n\nSufficient evidence of great bodily harm.— Where defendant was convicted of causing great bodily injury by vehicle following a collision in which defendant's vehicle, while traveling on a state road, crossed the center lane and struck a group of motorcyclists, there was sufficient evidence to support a finding of \"prolonged impairment\" where the victim testified that she experienced severe bruising, road rash, and bruised ribs as a result of the collision, that the bruising and road rash covered her right side, that she was unable to work for approximately a month, that for the first two weeks, she was unable to move because of the extreme pain resulting from her bruised ribs and that she still experiences pain resulting from the bruised ribs.State v. Cordova, 2016-NMCA-019, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nGreat bodily harm: mayhem.— The legislature adopted the definition in Subsection A of Section 30-1-12 NMSA 1978 in an effort to cover, among others, the crime of mayhem, originally enacted in 1853 to 1854 and compiled as former 40-30-1, 1953 Comp.State v. Ortega, 1966-NMSC-186, 77 N.M. 312, 422 P.2d 353.\n\nGreat bodily harm: establishing.— The conditions in Subsection A of Section 30-1-12 NMSA 1978 are not cumulative, and only one need be shown in order to establish \"great bodily harm\".State v. Bell, 1977-NMSC-013, 90 N.M. 134, 560 P.2d 925.\n\nGreat bodily harmdoes not require that disfigurement be permanent.State v. Bell, 1977-NMSC-013, 90 N.M. 134, 560 P.2d 925.\n\nGreat bodily harm: need not be proved solely by medical experts.— Furthermore, the law does not require that \"great bodily harm\" be proved exclusively by medical testimony. The jury is entitled to rely upon rational inferences deducible from the evidence.State v. Bell, 1977-NMSC-013, 90 N.M. 134, 560 P.2d 925.\n\nGreat bodily harm: degree of bodily harm a question of fact.— Where the evidence showed that defendants forcibly tattooed victim with a needle and India ink, which tattoo extended from the back of the victim's neck to the center part of the waist and recited an offensive sentence, it became a question of fact as to whether or not the injuries sustained were sufficiently substantial to come within the statutory definition of \"great bodily harm\".State v. Ortega, 1966-NMSC-186, 77 N.M. 312, 422 P.2d 353.\n\nGreat bodily harm: instruction on personal injury.— In a prosecution for criminal sexual penetration, where the trial court gave the statutory definition of personal injury appearing at Section 30-9-10C (now D) NMSA 1978, and also gave the statutory definition of great bodily harm in Subsection A of this section in the instruction on first degree criminal sexual penetration, the lack of additional definition of personal injury was not error; if defendant desired that personal injury be further defined, he should have submitted a requested instruction to that effect, and since he did not do so, he could not complain of the lack of additional definition of the term.State v. Jiminez, 1976-NMCA-096, 89 N.M. 652, 556 P.2d 60.\n\nDeadly weapon: knife.— For a knife to be a deadly weapon it must come within the portion of this statute as to any other deadly weapons with which dangerous wounds can be inflicted.State v. Martinez, 1953-NMSC-031, 57 N.M. 174, 256 P.2d 791.\n\nDeadly weapon: butterfly knife.— Where a defendant was charged with carrying a concealed deadly weapon, the prosecution was not required to prove that the knife could actually be used to inflict great bodily harm; the prosecution needed to prove only that a butterfly knife was a switchblade. There was sufficient evidence that the knife carried by defendant was a switchblade as defined in Section 30-7-8 NMSA 1978.State v. Riddall, 1991-NMCA-033, 112 N.M. 78, 811 P.2d 576, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 21, 810 P.2d 1241.\n\nDeadly weapon: wounds establishing deadliness of knife.— Where no one directly testified the knife was one with which dangerous wounds could be inflicted, but the wounds were described by the physician who treated the victim, and they were sufficiently severe to keep him in a hospital under the doctor's care for a week, and in addition, the scars caused by the knife wounds were shown to the jury, in view of the depth and the length of the wounds the jury was fully justified in finding the knife used was a deadly weapon, although the blade used was only about two inches in length.State v. Martinez, 1953-NMSC-031, 57 N.M. 174, 256 P.2d 791.\n\nDeadly weapon: other deadly weapons.— Under an aggravated stalking charge, when the object or instrument in question is an unlisted one that falls within the catchall language of Section 30-1-12B NMSA 1978, the jury must be instructed: (1) that the defendant must have possessed the object or instrument with the intent to use it as a weapon, and (2) the object or instrument is one that, if so used, could inflict dangerous wounds.State v. Anderson, 2001-NMCA-027, 130 N.M. 295, 24 P.3d 327.\n\nDeadly weapon: tire iron.— Defendant's use of a tire iron to break into a house fell under the definition that defendant was \"armed\" with a weapon under this section.State v. Alvarez-Lopez, 2003-NMCA-039, 133 N.M. 404, 62 P.3d 1286,rev'd on other grounds, 2004-NMSC-030, 136 N.M. 309, 98 P.3d 699.\n\nDeadly weapon: bullets not deadly weapon.— Defendant's mere possession of bullets did not constitute possession of a deadly weapon under Subsection B of this section.State v. Galaz, 2003-NMCA-076, 133 N.M. 794, 70 P.3d 784.\n\nDeadly weapon: jury to determine character of weapon.— The question of whether a weapon is capable of producing death or great bodily harm or is a weapon with which dangerous wounds can be inflicted is ordinarily for the jury who are to determine the question by considering the character of the instrument and the manner of its use, either by a description thereof (even though the weapon is not in evidence), or by viewing the weapon admitted into evidence (even though it is not described).State v. Gonzales, 1973-NMCA-153, 85 N.M. 780, 517 P.2d 1306.\n\nDeadly weapon: factual considerations.— Factors to be considered in determining whether an instrument is a deadly weapon include the nature of the instrument, that is, its size, shape, condition and possible alteration; the circumstances under which it is carried, that is, the time, place and situation in which defendant is found with the instrument; defendant's actions with regard to the instrument; and the place of concealment.State v. Blea, 1983-NMCA-089, 100 N.M. 237, 668 P.2d 1114.\n\nDeadly weapon: screwdriver.— Although the screwdriver was not introduced into evidence, the jury could determine the factual question of whether a deadly weapon was used by a description of the weapon and its use.State v. Candelaria, 1981-NMCA-122, 97 N.M. 64, 636 P.2d 883.\n\nDeadly weapon: brick wall.— Determination of whether a brick wall is a deadly weapon is a question of fact for the jury or fact finder to determine, given the evidence presented as to the manner and use of the wall.State v. Montano, 1999-NMCA-023, 126 N.M. 609, 973 P.2d 861, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 533, 972 P.2d 352, and cert. denied, 127 N.M. 390, 981 P.2d 1208 .\n\nDeadly weapon: baseball bat.— In a prosecution for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, the question of whether a baseball bat was a deadly weapon should have been left to the jury; however, when such a determination is made by the trial judge, the error is not fundamental and must be preserved for appeal.State v. Traeger, 2001-NMSC-022, 130 N.M. 618, 29 P.3d 518.\n\nDeadly weapon: jury to determine existence of weapon.— Whether defendant actually had gun, defined in this section as a deadly weapon, whether loaded or unloaded, in her hand as testified to by robbery victim was for the jury to resolve.State v. Encee, 1968-NMCA-012, 79 N.M. 23, 439 P.2d 240.\n\nDeadly weapon: insufficient evidence to show deadly character of weapon.— Evidence that defendant raised an undescribed tire tool over attendant's head \"like a threat,\" without more, was insufficient for a determination that the tire tool was a deadly weapon capable of producing death or great bodily harm or a weapon with which dangerous wounds could be inflicted.State v. Gonzales, 1973-NMCA-153, 85 N.M. 780, 517 P.2d 1306.\n\nDeadly weapon: pocketknife.— An ordinary pocketknife is not a per se deadly weapon, without regard to its actual or intended use.State v. Nick R., 2009-NMSC-050, 147 N.M. 182, 218 P.3d 868.\n\nDeadly weapon: BB gun.— The defendant's use of a BB gun during a robbery provided a sufficient factual basis to permit a jury to determine that a deadly weapon had been used because the jury could have concluded that the manner and character of use of the weapon satisfied the definition of a deadly weapon.State v. Fernandez, 2007-NMCA-091, 142 N.M. 231, 164 P.3d 112.\n\nDeadly weapon: the human mouthis a deadly weapon if the mouth is used in a manner that could cause death or great bodily harm.State v. Neatherlin, 2007-NMCA-035, 141 N.M. 328, 154 P.3d 703.\n\nPeace officer: Subsection C inapplicable to capital felony sentencing.— The definition of \"peace officer\" in Subsection C of this section is not directly applicable to Section 31-20A-5 NMSA 1978 because that definition applies only to the Criminal Code.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nPeace officer: legislature did not exclude jailers from definition of peace officers:a jailer is an officer in the public domain, charged with the duty to maintain public order.State v. Rhea, 1980-NMSC-033, 94 N.M. 168, 608 P.2d 144.\n\nPeace officer: juvenile correctional officers were not peace officerswithin the meaning of this section, where, although they may have had the power to maintain order and make arrests in their particular domain, they were not vested by law with a duty to do so.State v. Tabaha, 1986-NMCA-009, 103 N.M. 789, 714 P.2d 1010.\n\nPublic officer: officers of state game commissionare state officers.Allen v. McClellan, 1967-NMSC-114, 77 N.M. 801, 427 P.2d 677,overruled on other grounds byNew Mexico Livestock Bd. v. Dose, 1980-NMSC-022, 94 N.M. 68, 607 P.2d 606.\n\nPeace officer: CSO.— Community service officers are peace officers.State v. Ogden, 1994-NMSC-029, 118 N.M. 234, 880 P.2d 845.\n\nPerson: MFA.— The mortgage finance authority, a state agency established to raise funds through the issuance of tax-exempt bonds is a person within the meaning of the victim restitution statute.State v. Griffin, 1983-NMCA-072, 100 N.M. 75, 665 P.2d 1166\n\nPerson: corporate defendant.— Although a corporate defendant may be charged and convicted of the offense of racketeering, it was error to submit the racketeering charge against the corporate defendant to the jury because the corporate defendant was not specifically charged with commission of such crime in the indictment.State v. Crews, 1989-NMCA-088, 110 N.M. 723, 799 P.2d 592; cert. denied, 109 N.M. 232, 784 P.2d 419.\n\nLawful custody: electronic monitor.— The use of a conventional jail to hold the person is not necessary for there to be a \"lawful custody or confinement\" under the plain language of the statute. A \"lawful custody or confinement\" simply consists of the holding of any person pursuant to lawful authority\", and the actual means used to accomplish holding the person is without limitation. A mandatory sentence or imprisonment may be served under house arrest by an electronic monitor.State v. Woods, 2010-NMCA-017, 148 N.M. 89, 230 P.3d 836, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-001, 147 N.M. 673, 227 P.3d 1055.\n\nSpecial deputy.— Absent a limitation of authority a special deputy is a peace officer and is cloaked with all of the powers and duties of such. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-92.\n\nSchool security force.— Use of the term \"peace officer\" in describing security officers who were regular employees of the school system organized into a security and patrol force to guard school buildings and property would be improper. 1970 Op.

      "text": "A person may be charged with and convicted of the crime as an accessory if he procures, counsels, aids or abets in its commission and although he did not directly commit the crime and although the principal who directly committed such crime has not been prosecuted or convicted, or has been convicted of a different crime or degree of crime, or has been acquitted, or is a child under the Children's Code [Chapter 32A NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-1-14, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 1-14; 1972, ch. 97, § 66.\n\nAiding and abetting and conspiracy are distinct and separate concepts.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-126, 90 N.M. 12, 558 P.2d 1151.\n\nAccessory is one who\"procures\" commission of a crime.State v. Holden, 1973-NMCA-092, 85 N.M. 397, 512 P.2d 970, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 380, 512 P.2d 953.\n\nMeaning of terms.— The word \"crime,\" as used in the statute, means the principal offense, as in this case \"armed robbery,\" and the term \"as an accessory\" is merely describing in different terms one who aids and abets in the commission of the crime, and authorizes such person to be charged with and convicted of the crime.State v. Nance, 1966-NMSC-207, 77 N.M. 39, 419 P.2d 242, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1039, 87 S. Ct. 1495, 18 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1967).\n\nAbolition of distinction between principal and accessoryplaces defendant on notice that he or she could be charged as a principal and convicted as an accessory or vice versa.State v. Wall, 1980-NMSC-034, 94 N.M. 169, 608 P.2d 145.\n\nAiding and abetting not distinct offense.— There is nothing in this section indicating an intent to make one who aids and abets in the commission of a crime a separate offense distinct and different from the crime committed by the one actually perpetrating it, and the purpose of the legislature to authorize charging and convicting an accessory as a principal is made evident by the fact that no different penalty is provided by law for one who aids and abets. Hence, this section is to be read as though the words \"as an accessory\" were omitted.State v. Nance, 1966-NMSC-207, 77 N.M. 39, 419 P.2d 242, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1039, 87 S. Ct. 1495, 18 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1967).\n\nDistinctions abolished.— The distinction between an accessory before the fact and a principal was abolished in this state so that every person concerned in the commission may be prosecuted, tried and punished as a principal.State v. Nance, 1966-NMSC-207, 77 N.M. 39, 419 P.2d 242, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1039, 87 S. Ct. 1495, 18 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1967).\n\nEarned Meritorious Deductions Act.— Accessory liability is merely a different theory of liability, but is not a distinct offense. Accessories are therefore not convicted of a separate crime, but of the crime itself. Where defendant was convicted for violating Section 30-3-8 NMSA 1978 as an accessory to the crime, his sentence may be a serious violent offense under the Earned Meritorious Deductions Act as enumerated in Section 33-2-34L(4)(j) NMSA 1978. The fact that he pleaded guilty as an accessory and not a principal is irrelevant for purposes of the act.State v. Flores, 2005-NMCA-092, 138 N.M. 61, 116 P.3d 852.\n\nAccessory charged as principal.— New Mexico, like many other states, long ago abolished the distinction between conviction as a principal and an accessory, so that the charge as principal includes a corresponding accessory charge. An indictment need only allege the offense, not necessarily charge the defendant as accessory.Tapia v. Tansy, 926 F.2d 1554, 1562 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\nCharging accessory as principal.— An accessory may be charged and convicted as a principal.State v. Roque, 1977-NMCA-094, 91 N.M. 7, 569 P.2d 417, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 4, 569 P.2d 414.\n\nAccused may be indicted as principal even though at common law it would have been necessary to charge him as an accessory.State v. Nance, 1966-NMSC-207, 77 N.M. 39, 419 P.2d 242, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1039, 87 S. Ct. 1495, 18 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1967).\n\nAlthough charged with disturbing meeting, defendants could be convicted of aiding and abetting that disturbance.State v. Orzen, 1972-NMCA-006, 83 N.M. 458, 493 P.2d 768.\n\nThe contention that defendant could not be charged as a principal and convicted on the basis of being an accomplice is answered by this section.State v. Smith, 1976-NMCA-048, 89 N.M. 777, 558 P.2d 46,rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-085, 89 N.M. 770, 558 P.2d 39.\n\nEffect of rule.— Rule 5(d), N.M.R. Crim. P. (now seeParagraph D of Rule 5-201), which requires that the indictment allege \"essential facts constituting the offense,\" does not change the procedure authorized by this section, since \"the offense,\" as used in Rule 5(d), N.M.R. Crim. P., means the principal offense; thus, defendant was not required to be charged as an accessory and indictment was sufficient where the language contained therein informed defendant of the essential facts of the charge of armed robbery.State v. Roque, 1977-NMCA-094, 91 N.M. 7, 569 P.2d 417, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 4, 569 P.2d 414.\n\nElements of accessory liability.— Accomplice liability requires that the defendant share the criminal intent of the principal. There must be community of purpose, partnership in the unlawful undertaking. Indicia of such criminal intent may be as broad and varied as are the means of communicating thought from one individual to another. Mere presence and even mental approbation, if unaccompanied by outward manifestation or expression of such approval, is insufficient.State v. Johnson, 2004-NMSC-029, 136 N.M. 348, 98 P.3d 998, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 117, 125 S.Ct. 1334, 161 L.Ed.2d 162 (2005)..\n\nIntent.— The accessory must share the criminal intent of the principal.State v. Carrasco, 1997-NMSC-047, 124 N.M. 64, 946 P.2d 1075;State v. Montes, 2007-NMCA-083, 142 N.M. 221, 164 P.3d 102.\n\nIntent of accomplice.— One who solicits an end, or aids or agrees to aid in its achievement, is an accomplice in whatever means may be fairly employed, insofar as they constitute or commit an offense fairly envisaged in the purposes of the association. But when a wholly different crime has been committed, thus involving conduct not within the objectives of the conscious accomplice, the accomplice is not liable for it.Valdez v. Bravo, 373 F.3d 1093 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\nCriminal intent and purpose required.— Conviction could stand only if the record supported a conclusion that defendant shared the criminal intent and purpose of the principals, and mere presence without some outward manifestation of approval was insufficient.State v. Salazar, 1967-NMSC-187, 78 N.M. 329, 431 P.2d 62.\n\nIn order for an individual to be guilty as an aider and abettor, all that was necessary was that he share the criminal intent of defendant and that a community of purpose and partnership in the unlawful undertaking be present.State v. Ortega, 1966-NMSC-185, 77 N.M. 7, 419 P.2d 219;State v. Luna, 1979-NMCA-048, 92 N.M. 680, 594 P.2d 340.\n\nCriminal intent a jury question.— The question of whether the alleged aider and abettor did share the principal's criminal intent, and whether he knew the latter acted with criminal intent is one of fact for the jury and may be inferred from circumstances.State v. Riley, 1970-NMCA-015, 82 N.M. 298, 480 P.2d 693.\n\nIntent may be inferred.— Where one defendant completed the crime of burglary by an unauthorized entry with the necessary intent and his partner knew this fact and was present and participated, the partner's intent, as an element of the crime, although not susceptible of proof by direct evidence, may be inferred from his acts.State v. Riley, 1970-NMCA-015, 82 N.M. 298, 480 P.2d 693 (Ct. App. 1971).\n\nSpecific intent required.— The \"natural and probable result\" standard does not apply to determine accessory liability; thus, a jury cannot convict a defendant on accessory liability for a crime unless the defendant intended the principal's acts.State v. Carrasco, 1997-NMSC-047, 124 N.M. 64, 946 P.2d 1075.\n\nShooting at police car indicative of intent.— Defendant's theory that there is no evidence that he knew of the robbery until after its commission and thus could not have been an aider and abetter is invalid, as evidence of aiding and abetting is as broad and varied as are the means of communicating thought from one individual to another; shooting at the pursuing police car was evidence that defendant approved of the robbery and shared the robber's criminal intent.State v. O'Dell, 1973-NMCA-124, 85 N.M. 536, 514 P.2d 55.\n\nWhile mere presence is insufficient, relationship to victim relevant.— Although mere presence is insufficient to establish that defendant aided and abetted a crime, defendant's relationship with victim is a factor invoking criminal liability. Where defendant is charged with care and welfare of child, he stands in position of parent and may be convicted on the basis that he failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the molestation, coupled with his friendship with perpetrator.State v. Orosco, 1991-NMCA-084, 113 N.M. 789, 833 P.2d 1155,aff'd, 1992-NMSC-006, 113 N.M. 780, 833 P.2d 1146.\n\nManifestation of approval required.— Neither presence nor presence with mental approbation is sufficient to sustain a conviction as an aider or abettor. Presence must be accompanied by some outward manifestation or expression of approval.State v. Phillips, 1971-NMCA-114, 83 N.M. 5, 487 P.2d 915;State v. Luna, 1979-NMCA-048, 92 N.M. 680, 594 P.2d 340.\n\nDefendant's particular role not important.— Where the evidence as to which of the robbers took the change is sparse and conflicting, it does not matter that the evidence fails to establish, with any particularity, that defendant was the one who took the change as the jury was instructed on aiding and abetting and the evidence is substantial that defendant was at least an aider and abettor of the robbery of the change.State v. Urban, 1974-NMCA-046, 86 N.M. 351, 524 P.2d 523.\n\nForeseeability of result immaterial.— The fact that defendant did not bargain for the result is not material; the material fact is that he did \"procure\" another to perform an \"unlawful act.\"State v. Holden, 1973-NMCA-092, 85 N.M. 397, 512 P.2d 970, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 380, 512 P.2d 953.\n\nMeans of aiding and abetting varied.— The evidence of aiding and abetting may be as broad and varied as are the means of communicating thought from one individual to another; by acts, conduct, words, signs or by any means sufficient to incite, encourage or instigate commission of the offense or calculated to make known that commission of an offense already undertaken has the aider's support or approval. Mere presence, of course, and even mental approbation, if unaccompanied by outward manifestation or expression of such approval, is insufficient.State v. Salazar, 1967-NMSC-187, 78 N.M. 329, 431 P.2d 62;State v. Ochoa, 1937-NMSC-051, 41 N.M. 589, 72 P.2d 609;State v. Luna, 1979-NMCA-048, 92 N.M. 680, 594 P.2d 340.\n\nAccessory may be convicted regardless of principal's fate.— It was the obvious intent of the legislature to extend the statute then in force so as to permit an accessory to be prosecuted even though the one who directly committed the crime was either not prosecuted, had been acquitted, was a juvenile or had been convicted of a different crime or degree thereof.State v. Nance, 1966-NMSC-207, 77 N.M. 39, 419 P.2d 242, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1039, 87 S. Ct. 1495, 18 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1967).\n\nAider and abettor may be tried and convicted even though the actual slayer is never apprehended or has been tried and acquitted.State v. Ochoa, 1937-NMSC-051, 41 N.M. 589, 72 P.2d 609.\n\nVarying degrees of conviction permissible.— The fact that the accessory was convicted of involuntary manslaughter while the principal was convicted of voluntary manslaughter is a permissible result under the accessory statute.State v. Holden, 1973-NMCA-092, 85 N.M. 397, 512 P.2d 970, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 380, 512 P.2d 953.\n\nInstruction on burden of proof.— Where trial court instructed on the presumption of innocence and the state's burden of proof, it was not improper to refuse defendant's proffered instruction that there was no presumption that defendant was an accessory and that he did not have burden of proving that he was not an accessory.State v. Gunzelman, 1973-NMCA-121, 85 N.M. 535, 514 P.2d 54.\n\nEvidence.— The evidence shows aiding and abetting if it shows that by any of the means of communicating thought defendant incited, encouraged or instigated commission of the offense or made it known that commission of an offense already undertaken has the aider's support or approval.State v. Gonzales, 1971-NMCA-007, 82 N.M. 388, 482 P.2d 252, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 377, 482 P.2d 241.\n\nEvidence sufficient to go to jury.— Evidence that the defendants threw objects when others also threw them, and also evidence from which community of intent can be reasonably inferred, was sufficient for the issue of aiding and abetting to be submitted to the jury and was also sufficient to submit the issue of disturbing a lawful assembly.State v. Orzen, 1972-NMCA-006, 83 N.M. 458, 493 P.2d 768.\n\nJury may find defendant aided and abetted, but did not personally commit, crime.— That the jury could have refused to find that the defendant personally committed the crime in question is not alone a sufficient reasonable hypothesis that he did not aid and abet its commission.State v. Ballinger, 1983-NMCA-034, 99 N.M. 707, 663 P.2d 366,rev'd on other grounds, 1984-NMSC-003, 100 N.M. 583, 673 P.2d 1316.\n\nEvidence sufficient.— Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction as an accessory to armed robbery, where his confession, found to be voluntary, was corroborated by other evidence at trial.Church v. Sullivan, 942 F.2d 1501 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\nEvidence that the defendant's role in the robbery of a store was to remain outside in the car with the engine running in order to facilitate a fast getaway after others committed the robbery was sufficient to support his convictions.State v. Carrasco, 1996-NMCA-114, 122 N.M. 554, 928 P.2d 939,rev'd on other grounds, 1997-NMSC-047, 124 N.M. 64, 946 P.2d 1075.\n\nEvidence is constitutionally sufficient to support a finding of accessory liability where the testimony viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution establishes that accused and his companions went to victim's mobile home with the intention of fighting; accused willingly drove to the mobile home in his own vehicle; accused broke through the front door with his four companions and attacked victim's friend as he slept in a chair; accused fought victim's friend outside the back door of the house while his four companions attacked victim; accused then reentered the mobile home and warned the others as the police arrived; and accused's actions prevented victim's friend from assisting victim who died from the attack.Valdez v. Bravo, 373 F.3d 1093 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1008, 125 S. Ct. 622, 160 L. Ed.2d 473 (2004).\n\nSufficient evidence of intentional child abuse by torture.— Where a child victim testified that defendant, the child's foster father, purchased a stun gun and gave it to his son, that the child was stunned by defendant's son approximately fifteen times, was stunned by defendant's other son approximately three times, that defendant was present during the assaults by one of the sons and would laugh in response, and where there was corroborating testimony from the child's sister, a rational jury could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as an accessory to child abuse inflicted by another.State v. Vargas, 2016-NMCA-038.\n\nEvidence insufficient.— Where defendant was involved in an altercation between defendant's friend and the victim; the victim and defendant unexpectedly encountered each other later the same day; defendant went into a rage at seeing the victim and punched the victim who was seated in the victim's truck; the victim then shot defendant several times; defendant fell to the ground; the victim backed the victim's truck down the driveway; one of the victim's passengers started shooting a gun from the victim's truck; defendant's friends arrived at the scene of the shooting and began firing shots at the victim's truck, killing the victim; the jury acquitted defendant of the charge of shooting at a motor vehicle; and there was no evidence that defendant called for help to anyone after defendant was shot, that defendant summoned the defendant's friends who shot at the victim's truck, that defendant made any statement, that defendant took any action that indicated that defendant was aware that defendant's friends were in the vicinity, or that defendant had any communication with defendant's friends who shot at the victim's truck after the earlier altercation with the victim, the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction for aiding and abetting the murder of the victim.State v. Vigil, 2010-NMSC-003, 147 N.M. 537, 226 P.3d 636.\n\nCircumstantial evidence which was not incompatible with defendant's innocencenor incapable of explanation upon any reasonable hypothesis of same was insufficient to permit a finding that defendant aided a forger by procuring checks for her; there were too many other explanations to account for her possession of the checks.State v. Hermosillo, 1975-NMCA-113, 88 N.M. 424, 540 P.2d 1313.\n\nThe fact that the defendant accompanied the forger of certain checks at the time that she cashed them was not sufficient to support a finding of aiding and abetting, for mere presence and even mental approbation, if unaccompanied by outward manifestation or expression of such approval, is insufficient.State v. Hermosillo, 1975-NMCA-113, 88 N.M. 424, 540 P.2d 1313.\n\nKnowledge of the method of the crime and presence when the crime is committed are not required.— There is no legal requirement that an accessory know in advance the exact method by which a crime is to be carried out or even that the accessory be physically present when the crime is committed.State v. Bahney, 2012-NMCA-039, 274 P.3d 134, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-003.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where defendant's primary co-conspirator beat, drugged, and tied the victim to a bed in defendant's residence; defendant did not object to the treatment of the victim; defendant chided a secondary co-conspirator for being nervous and smoked marijuana with co-conspirator to calm the co-conspirator's nerves; defendant did not object when the primary co-conspirator considered killing the victim and burning the victim's car, but defended a secondary co-conspirator against the primary co-conspirator's violence; while the primary co-conspirator was absent from the residence for a lengthy period of time, defendant watched the victim and did not assist the victim or call the police; defendant demanded that the primary co-conspirator determine what to do with the victim before defendant's child returned from school; defendant left the residence to take the child to a store where, at the direction of the primary co-conspirator, defendant purchased charcoal lighter fluid; and while defendant remained at the residence with the child, defendant's co-conspirators put the victim in the trunk of the victim's car, drove the car to a school, doused the car with the lighter fluid, and burned the car, there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of kidnapping, second-degree murder and aggravated arson, as an accessory, beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Bahney, 2012-NMCA-039, 274 P.3d 134, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-003.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Confusing Law of Criminal Intent in New Mexico,\" see 5 N.M.L.

Roybal, 2006-NMCA-043, 139 N.M. 341, 132 P.3d 598, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-003, 139 N.M. 353, 132 P.3d 1039.\n\nVenue.— Where police officer chased defendant, who was speeding, from Santa Fe county into Rio Arriba county where defendant was placed under arrest for an outstanding warrant and where police officer discovered drugs and drug paraphernalia during an inventory search of defendant's car, Santa Fe county venue was proper because trafficking by possession with intent to distribute is a continuing offense which occurred in each county through which defendant traveled while in possession of the drugs.State v. Roybal, 2006-NMCA-043, 139 N.M. 341, 132 P.3d 598, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-003, 139 N.M. 353, 132 P.3d 1039.\n\nMeaning of \"trial\".— In its strict definition, the word \"trial\" in criminal procedure means the proceedings in open court after the pleadings are finished and the prosecution is otherwise ready, down to and including the rendition of the verdict; and the term \"trial\" does not extend to such preliminary steps as the arraignment and giving of the pleas, nor does it comprehend a hearing in error.State v. Eckles, 1968-NMSC-079, 79 N.M. 138, 441 P.2d 36.\n\n\"Material element of offense\" of contempt.— The act of causing the service of a restraining order to be made in Eddy county constituted a material element of the alleged offense of criminal contempt and under those circumstances the venue properly laid in Eddy county.Norton v. Reese, 1966-NMSC-154, 76 N.M. 602, 417 P.2d 205.\n\nProper venue when elements of offense committed in different counties.— In the event elements of a crime were committed in different counties, the trial may be had in any county in which a material element of the crime was committed. Interfering with or depriving a custodial parent of their right to custody is an essential element of the crime of custodial interference as are the methods for accomplishing the interference or deprivation. Because deprivation is an element, where the person was deprived of the right of custody establishes a proper venue for the trial of the offense of custodial interference.State v. Lefthand, 2015-NMCA-117, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-011.\n\nWhere defendant violated an order of custody, issued by a Taos county district court, by depriving the father of the child of his right to custody, the father's right to custody exists with him in his county of residence, the county in which he was given custody, and the county in which he was deprived of the custody of his son. Under the custodial interference statute, 30-4-4 NMSA 1978, a person may be charged in the place where the harm sought to be prevented by the statute results, and therefore venue may lie in Taos county district court.State v. Lefthand, 2015-NMCA-117, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-011.\n\nII. NATURE OF VENUE.\n\nDistinction between jurisdiction and venue.— Jurisdiction refers to the judicial power to hear and determine a criminal prosecution, whereas venue relates to and defines the particular county or territorial area within a state or district in which the prosecution is to be brought or tried.State v. Ramirez, 1976-NMCA-101, 89 N.M. 635, 556 P.2d 43,overruled on other grounds by Sells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nPrivilege personal to accused.— Venue provision of the constitution confers a personal privilege of venue upon an accused, and this privilege may be waived.State v. Lopez, 1973-NMSC-041, 84 N.M. 805, 508 P.2d 1292.\n\nExtent of constitutional venue provision.— The framers of the constitution sought to guarantee the right to trial by an impartial jury, rather than an absolute right to trial by a jury of the county wherein the crime is alleged to have occurred.State v. Lopez, 1973-NMSC-041, 84 N.M. 805, 508 P.2d 1292.\n\nAssertion of privilege.— A defendant may insist on personal right or privilege of venue, and the correctness of a venue decision is reviewable to determine whether defendant was tried in the proper county.State v. Wise, 1977-NMCA-074, 90 N.M. 659, 567 P.2d 970, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 4, 569 P.2d 414.\n\nChange of venue effective in overcoming local bias and prejudice.State v. White, 1967-NMSC-016, 77 N.M. 488, 424 P.2d 402.\n\nIII. PROOF.\n\nVenue need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Wise, 1977-NMCA-074, 90 N.M. 659, 567 P.2d 970, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 4, 569 P.2d 414.\n\nAffirmative proof of venue unnecessary.— It is not necessary in a trial for murder that venue be affirmatively proven.Territory of N.M. v. Hicks, 1892-NMSC-024, 6 N.M. 596, 30 P. 872,overruled on other grounds byHaynes v. United States, 1899-NMSC-003, 9 N.M. 519, 56 P. 282.\n\nVenue may be proved by circumstantial evidence,and when there is nothing in the record to raise an inference to the contrary, slight circumstances are sufficient to prove venue by a preponderance of the evidence.State v. Nelson, 1959-NMSC-023, 65 N.M. 403, 338 P.2d 301, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 877, 80 S. Ct. 142, 4 L. Ed. 2d 115.\n\nVenue, like any other fact in a case, may be proven by circumstantial evidence.State v. Mares, 1921-NMSC-048, 27 N.M. 212, 199 P. 111.\n\nVenue proved by incidental evidence.— If evidence incidentally given in connection with facts in case shows that venue was properly laid, it is a sufficient proof of venue.Territory of N.M. v. Hicks, 1892-NMSC-024, 6 N.M. 596, 30 P. 872,overruled on other grounds byHaynes v. United States, 1899-NMSC-003, 9 N.M. 519, 56 P. 282.\n\nOmission in indictment not fatal.— Trial of one charged with homicide may take place either where the mortal wound was inflicted or where the person died, and where prosecution was in county where the mortal wound was inflicted, an indictment omitting allegation of place of death was not fatally defective.State v. Montes, 1917-NMSC-026, 22 N.M. 530, 165 P. 797.\n\nCredibility of venue testimony.— Attacks upon the credibility of the witnesses who testified concerning venue is a matter for the jury to decide.State v. Garcia, 1967-NMSC-140, 78 N.M. 136, 429 P.2d 334.\n\nNo instruction on venue is required,because so long as the crime occurred in New Mexico, the county of the crime is not necessary for jury determination.State v. Wise, 1977-NMCA-074, 90 N.M. 659, 567 P.2d 970, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 4, 569 P.2d 414.\n\nAlthough prior to the adoption of U.J.I. Criminal the practice was to instruct on venue, this practice is discontinued therein, since venue is not jurisdictional, but is a personal right or privilege of the accused which may be waived.State v. Wise, 1967-NMSC-140, 90 N.M. 659, 567 P.2d 970, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 4, 569 P.2d 414.\n\nInstruction and finding sufficient.— Where a jury was specifically instructed that it must find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the fatal blow and the death occurred in the county of the venue and this the jury did so find, any argument that the blow or the cause of death may have occurred elsewhere was of no consequence.Nelson v. Cox, 1960-NMSC-005, 66 N.M. 397, 349 P.2d 118;State v. Wise, 1977-NMCA-074, 90 N.M. 659, 567 P.2d 970, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 4, 569 P.2d 414.\n\nIV. WAIVER.\n\nVenue provision confers personal privilege upon accused which may be waived.State v. Lopez, 1973-NMSC-041, 84 N.M. 805, 508 P.2d 1292.\n\nVenue unlike jurisdiction.— Venue does not affect the power of the court and can be waived, but a jurisdictional defect can never be waived because it goes to the very power of the court to entertain the action, and such a defect can be raised at any stage of the proceedings, even sua sponte by the appellate court.State v. Ramirez, 1976-NMCA-101, 89 N.M. 635, 556 P.2d 43,overruled on other grounds bySells v. State, 1982-NMSC-125, 98 N.M. 786, 653 P.2d 162.\n\nFailure to object.— Right to trial in the county or district in which the offense is alleged to have been committed is waived by failure to make timely objection.City of Roswell v. Gallegos, 1966-NMSC-246, 77 N.M. 170, 420 P.2d 438.\n\nRight to be tried in a certain county or district is a right or privilege to a particular venue which may be waived by an accused person in a number of ways, and when defendant goes to trial in another judicial district, without objection on his part, he has waived the privilege, and cannot be heard to say that the court trying him was without jurisdiction.State v. Lopez, 1973-NMSC-041, 84 N.M. 805, 508 P.2d 1292.\n\nAcquiescence in venue change.— Defendant who agreed to a change of venue waived any right he may have had to insist on a continuance of the case.State v. White, 1967-NMSC-016, 77 N.M. 488, 424 P.2d 402.\n\nRecord of affirmative waiver unnecessary.— The record need not affirmatively show that the trial court fully informed defendant of his right of venue and of his privilege to waive this right, or was advised that defendant had been so fully informed, that defendant affirmatively waived this right or that the trial court announced its satisfaction as to the genuineness of this waiver.State v. Lopez, 1973-NMSC-041, 84 N.M. 805, 508 P.2d 1292.\n\nV. SPECIFIC SITUATIONS.\n\nVenue proper.— Where defendant signed checks in Bernalillo county to pay the wages of three members of an Indian tribe for performing work on a construction project that was located on Indian land in McKinley county; defendant gave the checks to an employee of defendant's construction company at a meeting place that was located outside McKinley county for delivery to the payees; the checks were delivered to the payees in McKinley county; the payees cashed the checks at a store that was located in McKinley county; and defendant's bank dishonored the checks for insufficient funds, venue was proper in McKinley county.State v. Cruz, 2010-NMCA-011, 147 N.M. 753, 228 P.3d 1173,rev'd on other grounds, 2011-NMSC-038, 150 N.M. 548, 263 P.3d 890.\n\nVenue for violation of municipal ordinancemust be laid in the municipality where the violation presumably occurred.City of Roswell v. Gallegos, 1966-NMSC-246, 77 N.M. 170, 420 P.2d 438.\n\nProsecution for embezzlement.— Venue in embezzlement is properly laid in the county where the possession becomes adverse to the owner.Territory v. Hale, 1905-NMSC-021, 13 N.M. 181, 81 P. 583.\n\nMurder trial in county of death.— In a trial for murder, the evidence that the person alleged to have been murdered died in county where venue was laid, is a sufficient proof of venue.Territory of N.M. v. Hicks, 1892-NMSC-024, 6 N.M. 596, 30 P. 872,overruled on other grounds byHaynes v. United States, 1899-NMSC-003, 9 N.M. 519, 56 P. 282.\n\nDeath in Texas after wounding in New Mexico.— Where decedent dies in Texas of wound inflicted in a county in New Mexico, defendant may be prosecuted in that New Mexico county.Bourguet v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R.R., 1958-NMSC-148, 65 N.M. 200, 334 P.2d 1107.\n\nAlthough the deceased died in Texas, the blow was struck in Quay county, and hence venue was proper in that county.State v. Justus, 1959-NMSC-008, 65 N.M. 195, 334 P.2d 1104, cert. denied, 365 U.S. 828, 81 S. Ct. 714, 5 L. Ed. 2d 706 (1961).\n\nVenue proper in New Mexico where theft occurred out of state.— A person who steals property outside New Mexico and brings the stolen property into this state may be prosecuted, convicted, and punished for larceny in New Mexico.State v. Stephens, 1990-NMCA-081, 110 N.M. 525, 797 P.2d 314, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 533, 797 P.2d 983.\n\nVenue improper where offenses completed before reaching county.— Where the first six criminal sexual penetration offenses were completed before reaching Bernalillo county, trial in Bernalillo county as to those offenses was improper.State v. Ramirez, 1978-NMCA-102, 92 N.M. 206, 585 P.2d 651.\n\nAbsent prejudice venue provisions inapplicable to Rule 93 hearing.— Neither constitutional nor statutory provisions on venue apply to a hearing under Rule 93, N.M.R. Civ. P. (considering defendant's motion to vacate judgment and sentence against him, now withdrawn), because such a hearing is neither a criminal trial nor a criminal prosecution, but rather a civil proceeding.State v. Eckles, 1968-NMSC-079, 79 N.M. 138, 441 P.2d 36 (decided under prior law).\n\nSince defendant had no right to be present at a hearing under Rule 93, N.M.R. Civ. P. (now withdrawn), a fortiori he had no right to be heard in a particular place, absent a showing of prejudice.State v. Eckles, 1968-NMSC-079, 79 N.M. 138, 441 P.2d 36 (decided under prior law).\n\nSection is consistent with present constitutional and statutory provisionsregarding the place of prosecution. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-12.\n\nRight of venue is legal concept separate and distinct from territorial jurisdiction of magistrate,and a statute affecting one does not necessarily affect the other. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-12.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Survey of New Mexico Law, 1979-80: Criminal Law and Procedure,\" see 11 N.M.L. Rev. 85 (1981).\n\nAm.
