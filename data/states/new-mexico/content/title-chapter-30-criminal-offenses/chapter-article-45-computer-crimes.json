Rowell, 1995-NMSC-079, 121 N.M. 111, 908 P.2d 1379.\n\nUsing a computer as a passive conduit not covered by statute.— The Computer Crimes Act, 30-45-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., was intended by the legislature to deter and punish crimes committed through the abuse of computer sophistication and to protect against the introduction of fraudulent data into a computer system, the unauthorized use of computer facilities, the alteration or destruction of computerized information or files, and the stealing of financial information data or other assets, but was not intended to apply to the use of a computer as a passive conduit through which the defendant's criminal activity passed.State v. Garcia, 2015-NMCA-094,rev'd on other grounds, 2016-NMSC-034.\n\nInsufficient evidence of computer access with intent to defraud.— Where defendant, with the victim's permission, used a computer to access victim's bank accounts and transfer funds to defendant's own bank accounts for personal use, the evidence was insufficient to convict defendant of computer access with intent to defraud because defendant did not introduce fraudulent data into a computer system, use computer facilities without authorization, alter or destroy computerized information or files, nor did she steal financial information, data or other assets, but merely used the computer as a passive conduit to access accounts and transfer funds, just as any banking customer would.State v. Garcia, 2015-NMCA-094,rev'd on other grounds, 2016-NMSC-034.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Criminal Law: Applying the General/Specific Statute Rule in New Mexico - State v. Santillanes,\" see 32 N.M.
