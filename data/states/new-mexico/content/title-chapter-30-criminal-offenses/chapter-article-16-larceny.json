      "text": "A. Larceny consists of the stealing of anything of value that belongs to another.\n\nB. Whoever commits larceny when the value of the property stolen is two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or less is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nC. Whoever commits larceny when the value of the property stolen is over two hundred fifty dollars ($250) but not more than five hundred dollars ($500) is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nD. Whoever commits larceny when the value of the property stolen is over five hundred dollars ($500) but not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nE. Whoever commits larceny when the value of the property stolen is over two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) but not more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) is guilty of a third degree felony.\n\nF. Whoever commits larceny when the value of the property stolen is over twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) is guilty of a second degree felony.\n\nG. Whoever commits larceny when the property of value stolen is livestock is guilty of a third degree felony regardless of its value.\n\nH. Whoever commits larceny when the property of value stolen is a firearm is guilty of a fourth degree felony when its value is less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500).\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-16-1, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 16-1; 1969, ch. 171, § 1; 1979, ch. 118, § 1; 1987, ch. 121, § 1; 2006, ch. 29, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For sheriff's duty to search for stolen livestock,see29-1-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor description of cattle in indictment,see31-7-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor provision making disposal of livestock levied upon grand larceny,see39-6-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor provision on recovery of lost or stolen property from junk dealers,see57-7-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor possession of livestock by person accused of theft without bill of sale being prima facie evidence of illegal possession,see77-9-21 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor livestock board inspector's duty to search for stolen livestock,see77-9-33 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor failure of person killing cattle or sheep to show hide to inspector as evidence of larceny or receipt of stolen livestock,see77-17-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2006 amendment,effective July 1, 2006, increased the value of property in Subsection B from $100 or less to $250 or less; increased the value of property in Subsection C from more than $100 but less than $250 to more than $250 but less than $500; and increased the value of property in Subsection D from more than $250 to more than $500.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, added the third paragraph, substituted \"two hundred fifty dollars ($250)\" for \"one hundred dollars ($100)\" in the fourth paragraph, and substituted \"is over\" for \"exceeds\" and \"more than\" for \"over\" in the fifth paragraph.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nLarceny of livestock category constitutional.— The portion of larceny statute, which made it a felony to steal livestock regardless of its value, applied to all persons who steal livestock in the state of New Mexico, and did not constitute special legislation contrary to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 24, nor did it deny defendant equal protection under the law.State v. Pacheco, 1969-NMCA-127, 81 N.M. 97, 463 P.2d 521 (decided under prior law).\n\nPunishment under former law.— The punishment of the crime of stealing mules by not less than 30 lashes on the bare back was not \"cruel and inhuman\" under the United States constitution.Garcia v. Territory, 1869-NMSC-001, 1 N.M. 415 (decided under prior law).\n\nRestitution does not wipe out crime of larcenyand does not deprive state of the right to prosecute for the crime.State v. Odom, 1974-NMCA-118, 86 N.M. 761, 527 P.2d 802.\n\nLegislature to define crimes.— It cannot be gainsaid that the hide of neat cattle is a part of the animal and its removal from the carcass without permission of the owner and subsequent appropriation thereof constitutes theft; under former law the legislature said it shall constitute the crime of larceny, and it is no part of the duty of the courts to inquire into the wisdom, the policy or the justness of an act of the legislature.State v. Thompson, 1953-NMSC-072, 57 N.M. 459, 260 P.2d 370 (decided under prior law).\n\nOwner's consent to taking.— In order for an owner to consent to a theft, more than a passive assent to the taking is required.State v. Ontiveros, 1990-NMCA-112, 111 N.M. 90, 801 P.2d 672, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 77, 801 P.2d 659.\n\nA person does not consent to his property being taken by purposely leaving it exposed, or failing to resist the taking, even though he may know that another intends to come and steal it.State v. Ontiveros, 1990-NMCA-112, 111 N.M. 90, 801 P.2d 672, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 77, 801 P.2d 659.\n\nPretended cooperation of an agent of an owner in effecting the theft from the owner is not consent.State v. Ontiveros, 1990-NMCA-112, 111 N.M. 90, 801 P.2d 672, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 77, 801 P.2d 659.\n\nAn owner's nonconsent to larceny may be established by the facts and circumstances in evidence.State v. Ontiveros, 1990-NMCA-112, 111 N.M. 90, 801 P.2d 672, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 77, 801 P.2d 659.\n\nAuthorized sentence unassailable.— Where defendant, who pleaded guilty to larceny of property worth over $2500, a third degree felony, was sentenced to the term authorized by law for a third degree felony his assertion that codefendants were sentenced for a fourth degree felony on the basis of \"the same identical act\" and that the state had reduced the charge against one codefendant to a fourth degree felony provided no basis for post-conviction relief.State v. Follis, 1970-NMCA-083, 81 N.M. 690, 472 P.2d 655.\n\nOwnership conclusively determined.— A defendant in a larceny case was, after conviction, barred from litigating the question of ownership of the stolen property with owner thereof as charged in the indictment.Supulver v. Gilchrist & Dawson, Inc., 1922-NMSC-060, 28 N.M. 339, 211 P. 595.\n\nEvidence held sufficient to sustain larceny conviction.State v. Davis, 1982-NMCA-057, 97 N.M. 745, 643 P.2d 614.\n\nTort liability to thief.— The rules of law governing the liability of appellee for shooting and wounding appellant while stopping a trespass or the theft of watermelons are the same whether the proceedings be civil or criminal.Brown v. Martinez, 1961-NMSC-040, 68 N.M. 271, 361 P.2d 152.\n\nII. MULTIPLE PROSECUTIONS OR PUNISHMENTS.\n\nLarceny of firearm punishable as separate offense.— Under the structure of this section, where the property stolen includes both generic property and a firearm, larceny of the firearm is punishable as a separate offense.State v. Alvarez-Lopez, 2004-NMSC-030, 136 N.M. 309, 98 P.3d 699.\n\nUnit of prosecution under livestock larceny statute.— In consolidated appeals, where the state charged each defendant with one count of livestock larceny per animal allegedly stolen, resulting in multiple-count criminal informations, and where, prior to trial, defendants filed motions to merge or dismiss the multiple charges, asserting that they instead may only be prosecuted for each episode of theft, the district court did not err in granting the defendants' motions, because in the livestock larceny statute, the New Mexico legislature did not intend a unit of prosecution based on the number of animals stolen in an episode of theft. The livestock larceny statute, instead, expresses an intent to prosecute defendants for each episode of theft.State v. Torres, 2022-NMSC-024,aff'g on other grounds, 2021-NMCA-045, 495 P.3d 1141 and A-1-CA-38561, mem. op. (N.M. Ct. App., Sept. 30, 2020) (nonprecedential).\n\nSingle larceny doctrine.— The single larceny doctrine, also known as the single criminal intent doctrine, is a canon of construction used when the legislature's intent regarding multiple punishments is ambiguous. When several articles of property are stolen by the defendant from the same owner at the same time and at the same place, only one larceny is committed.State v. Torres, 2021-NMCA-045, cert. granted.\n\nSingle larceny doctrine applied to interpret the unit of prosecution for larceny of livestock.— In consolidated appeals, where defendants, in separate and unrelated incidents of cattle rustling, were each charged with multiple counts of larceny of livestock based on one count per head of cattle stolen, and where the district court dismissed multiple counts against each defendant, concluding that § 30-16-1(G) NMSA 1978, defined the unit of prosecution as a single offense regardless of the number of animals taken, reasoning that the term \"livestock\" is used by our legislature to refer to animals in the aggregate, and that the term \"livestock\" is plural and, accordingly, it is the aggregate of the parts such that a single offense exists irrespective of whether one or ten animals were taken, the district court did not err in dismissing multiple counts of larceny or in concluding that the unit of prosecution for larceny of livestock is a single offense regardless of the number of animals taken, because applying the single larceny doctrine, it clarifies that a taking of multiple head of cattle at the same time and place, or a series of takings from a single owner with a single criminal intent, constitutes but one larceny.State v. Torres, 2021-NMCA-045, cert. granted.\n\nLarceny of several articles.— Under the \"single larceny doctrine,\" as a matter of judicial policy, a taking of two or more articles of property from the same owner at the same time and place should be prosecuted as only one larceny, even though separate convictions would not be barred by double jeopardy.State v. Boeglin, 1977-NMCA-004, 90 N.M. 93, 559 P.2d 1220.\n\nNothing in the statutory language indicates that the legislature intended to create a separate offense for each taking of property belonging to different persons during a continuous episode.State v. Brown, 1992-NMCA-028, 113 N.M. 631, 830 P.2d 183, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 636, 830 P.2d 553.\n\nCharge of larceny is necessarily included in charge of robbery.State v. Eckles, 1968-NMSC-079, 79 N.M. 138, 441 P.2d 36.\n\nGrand larceny and armed robbery merged.— Where the act of grand larceny was necessary to, or incidental to, the crime of armed robbery which the defendant committed, the offense of grand larceny was merged with the graver offense of armed robbery, and hence although the defendant was properly convicted of both armed robbery and grand larceny, he cannot be doubly punished for both of those crimes.State v. Quintana, 1961-NMSC-108, 69 N.M. 51, 364 P.2d 120;State v. Montano, 1961-NMSC-174, 69 N.M. 332, 367 P.2d 95.\n\nNo merger of larceny and burglary.— There is no merger when an accused is charged with both burglary and larceny though the charges stem from one transaction or event.State v. Deats, 1971-NMCA-089, 82 N.M. 711, 487 P.2d 139.\n\nElements of larceny and burglary differ.— Since stealing is a necessary element of larceny but is not a necessary element of burglary, larceny is not necessarily involved in a burglary; hence, these two crimes do not merge, and defendant could be convicted of and sentenced for both crimes.State v. McAfee, 1967-NMSC-139, 78 N.M. 108, 428 P.2d 647.\n\nLarceny is not a lesser included offense of burglary, since each crime includes an element not contained in the other. Burglary requires entry into a dwelling, whereas larceny does not, and larceny requires an actual taking, whereas burglary does not.Yparrea v. Dorsey, 64 F.3d 577 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\nAssault and larceny separate offenses.— Assault with a deadly weapon, even though committed in connection with a larceny is a separate criminal act, as distinguished from a necessary ingredient of the crime of larceny, and, accordingly, there may be a conviction and punishment for both.State v. Martinez, 1967-NMSC-103, 77 N.M. 745, 427 P.2d 260.\n\nUnlawful taking of motor vehicle not included offense.— Violation of 64-9-4A, 1953 Comp. (now repealed), by unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, is not necessarily included in offense of larceny, since the criminal intent requisite for the crime of larceny is the intent to deprive the owner of his property permanently, while a violation of 64-9-4A, 1953 Comp. (now repealed), does not require this intent.State v. Eckles, 1968-NMSC-079, 79 N.M. 138, 441 P.2d 36 (decided under prior law, statute repealed).\n\nReceipt of stolen goods by thief himself.— A thief who holds on to stolen property cannot be guilty of receiving the stolen property because he cannot receive it from himself, nor can he violate the statute by retaining the stolen property because larceny is a continuing offense; the thief's disposition of the property, however, is action separate from the larceny, and it is neither absurd nor unreasonable to hold that the thief violates 30-16-11 NMSA 1978 when he disposes of the property that he stole.State v. Tapia, 1976-NMCA-042, 89 N.M. 221, 549 P.2d 636, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 206, 549 P.2d 284.\n\nAsportation of stolen property.— Larceny was a continuing offense, and if property was stolen in one county and taken by the thief into another, he was guilty of a new caption and asportation in the latter county.State v. McKinley, 1924-NMSC-052, 30 N.M. 54, 227 P. 757;State v. Meeks, 25 N.M. 231, 180 P. 295.\n\nTransporting stolen livestock and larceny of livestock.— Defendant's conviction for transporting stolen livestock, when considered with his conviction for larceny of livestock, violated his constitutional right to be free of double jeopardy.State v. Clark, 2000-NMCA-052, 129 N.M. 194, 3 P.3d 689, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 207, 4 P.3d 35.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Because defendant's case was a single prosecution case, under which the single larceny doctrine was implicated, defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated by defendant's two punishments for violations of two clauses of this section.State v. Alvarez-Lopez, 2003-NMCA-039, 133 N.M. 404, 62 P.3d 1286,rev'd, 2004-NMSC-030, 136 N.M. 309, 98 P.3d 699, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1177, 125 S. Ct. 1334, 161 L. Ed. 2d 162 (2005).\n\nMunicipal court conviction of larceny is not the same offense for purposes of double jeopardy as a district court conviction of theft of a credit card.State v. Rodriguez, 2005-NMSC-019, 138 N.M. 21, 116 P.3d 92.\n\nTheft of credit card.— Larceny is a lesser included offense of theft of a credit card.State v. Rodriguez, 2005-NMSC-019, 138 N.M. 21, 116 P.3d 92.\n\nIII. ELEMENTS OF OFFENSE.\n\nCorpus delicti.— The corpus delicti of larceny is constituted of two elements: that the property was lost by the owner, and that it was lost by a felonious taking.State v. Paris, 1966-NMSC-039, 76 N.M. 291, 414 P.2d 512;State v. Buchanan, 1966-NMSC-045, 76 N.M. 141, 412 P.2d 565.\n\nOwnership of another.— In cases of larceny and embezzlement, ownership of the property stolen or embezzled must be established in some person or entity capable of owning property.State v. Parsons, 1917-NMSC-084, 23 N.M. 520, 169 P. 475.\n\nOwnership issues.— Every larceny included a trespass to possession, which could not exist unless the property was in possession of person from whom it was charged to have been stolen.State v. Curry, 1927-NMSC-015, 32 N.M. 219, 252 P. 994.\n\nParticular ownership not essential.— Neither an allegation or proof of ownership in a particular person is an essential element of the offense of larceny, it being sufficient that the proof disclosed that property stolen belonged to one other than defendant.State v. Ford, 1969-NMCA-092, 80 N.M. 649, 459 P.2d 353.\n\nViolence not an element.— Larceny, although an essential element of the offense of robbery, is distinguished primarily on the basis of the violence which precedes or accompanies the taking; robbery is a compound or aggravated larceny, composed of the crime of larceny from the person with the aggravation of force, actual or constructive, used in the taking.State v. Wingate, 1975-NMCA-035, 87 N.M. 397, 534 P.2d 776.\n\n\"Steal\" connotes intent.— Under the statute using the term \"steal,\" when that term is used in the instruction, it carries with it a meaning that the taking must have been with a felonious intent.State v. Paris, 1966-NMSC-039, 76 N.M. 291, 414 P.2d 512.\n\nSpecific intent to permanently deprive requisite.— One of the essential elements of larceny is that of intent on the part of defendant to permanently deprive the owners of their property; hence, a taking of property by defendant with the intent of using it temporarily and then returning it would not constitute larceny.State v. Parker, 1969-NMCA-056, 80 N.M. 551, 458 P.2d 803, cert. denied, 80 N.M. 607, 458 P.2d 859.\n\nAs distinguished from wrongful taking of car.— Larceny includes the concept of criminal intent, and in addition, the intention to permanently deprive the owner of possession of his property, such intention to permanently deprive is not an essential element of 64-9-4A, 1953 Comp., prohibiting intentional taking of a motor vehicle without consent of the owner.State v. Austin, 1969-NMCA-095, 80 N.M. 748, 461 P.2d 230 (decided under prior law, statute repealed).\n\nEmbezzlement.— A legislative intent to include the element of intent to permanently deprive the owner of his property in crime of embezzlement cannot be ascertained by comparing the embezzlement statute 30-16-8 NMSA 1978 with this section, because larceny is defined in terms of stealing and comparable language is not used in the embezzlement statute.State v. Moss, 1971-NMCA-117, 83 N.M. 42, 487 P.2d 1347.\n\nValue of livestock immaterial.— Under former law, in prosecution for depriving owner of possession of certain sheep, value of the animals was not material, it did not need to be alleged and if alleged, did not need to be proved.State v. Anaya, 1922-NMSC-059, 28 N.M. 283, 210 P. 567;see alsoState v. Jaramillo, 1919-NMSC-013, 25 N.M. 228, 180 P. 286;State v. Lucero, 1913-NMSC-011, 17 N.M. 484, 131 P. 491 (prosecutions for larceny of cattle).\n\nTheft from employer.— Since the physical control exercised by an employee over property entrusted to him by his employer is merely custody and not possession, an employee takes the property from his employer's possession, and thereby commits a trespass, when he converts it; he is accordingly guilty of larceny, without regard to whether he entertained such intent at the time he acquired custody, or not.State v. Robertson, 1977-NMCA-044, 90 N.M. 382, 563 P.2d 1175, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nAiding and abetting.— To be an aider and abettor in the crime of larceny one must share the criminal intent of the principal; there must be a community of purpose in the unlawful undertaking.State v. Duran, 1974-NMCA-088, 86 N.M. 594, 526 P.2d 188, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 593, 526 P.2d 187.\n\nEffect of intoxication on intent.— Voluntary intoxication alone is not a defense to a charge of larceny, but if a defendant claims he was so intoxicated as to be unable to form the necessary intent, the question of intent is a matter for the jury.State v. Lucero, 1962-NMSC-077, 70 N.M. 268, 372 P.2d 837.\n\nRestitution no bar to conviction.— Fact that defendant turned himself in to owner and worked to make restitution for theft, that owner told defendant he would have larceny charges against him dismissed and that this was not done, if true, provided no legal basis for withdrawal of guilty plea.State v. Odom, 1974-NMCA-118, 86 N.M. 761, 527 P.2d 802.\n\nIV. INDICTMENT AND INFORMATION.\n\nAllegation of ownership.— In indictment charging embezzlement it is essential to aver the felonious conversion of the property of another; unless the rule is modified by statute, the allegation must be as accurate as in an indictment for larceny, and in case of an association, facts must be averred to show that the association could own property in its name.State v. Parsons, 1917-NMSC-084, 23 N.M. 520, 169 P. 475 (decided under prior law).\n\nLaying ownership in representative.— Where owner of stolen mule was dead, indictment charging larceny was to lay the ownership in his representative and not in his estate.Territory v. Valles, 1909-NMSC-026, 15 N.M. 228, 103 P. 984.\n\nDeprivation of owner's possession understood.— Where indictment charged that defendant \"then and there, unlawfully and feloniously did take, steal and knowingly drive away, etc.\" the animal in question, it was not necessary to further allege that the owner was thereby deprived of the immediate possession of the animal.State v. Roberts, 1914-NMSC-004, 18 N.M. 480, 138 P. 208.\n\nDescribing stolen animal in indictment as a \"cow\" was sufficient.Wilburn v. Territory, 1900-NMSC-028, 10 N.M. 402, 62 P. 968.\n\nWord \"feloniously\" unnecessary.— It was not necessary to use word \"feloniously\" in information charging larceny from house or other building, under Laws 1869-1870, ch. 26, §§ 1, 2 (former 40-45-6, 40-45-7, 1953 Comp.), to support sentence of three to five years.State v. Jones, 1930-NMSC-007, 34 N.M. 499, 285 P. 501.\n\nAllegation of knowledge.— The third crime defined by 79, 1897 C.L. (former 40-4-17, 1953 Comp.), of knowingly killing or otherwise depriving the owners of animals of their immediate possession, was a purely statutory one; use of word \"knowingly\" made knowledge an element of the crime, and an indictment failing to allege it in words of statute or words of similar import failed to state the offense.Territory v. Cortez, 1909-NMSC-010, 15 N.M. 92, 103 P. 264 (decided under prior law).\n\nAllegation that defendant \"committed crime of larceny\" would be sufficientwhere the crime constituted both statutory grand larceny and common-law larceny.State v. Shroyer, 1945-NMSC-014, 49 N.M. 196, 160 P.2d 444 (decided under prior law).\n\nInformation adequate.— Information charging grand larceny, particularized by referring to section relating to grand larceny, was sufficient where crime was covered by that section.State v. Lucero, 1962-NMSC-077, 70 N.M. 268, 372 P.2d 837.\n\nParticulars specified.— Where amendment of information which charged defendant with larceny of sheep apprised him of particulars he might have asked for in a bill of particulars, he suffered no injustice.State v. Shroyer, 1945-NMSC-014, 49 N.M. 196, 160 P.2d 444.\n\nDefendant entitled to more definite specification.— Where charge simply alleged that defendant did steal and carry away certain articles of personal property of a stated value and being the property of a named individual, and there was not a single word to indicate the nature or character of the property, the charge was too vague and indefinite upon which to deprive defendant of his liberty when he had sought a more definite specification of what constituted the personal property which he was charged with stealing.State v. Campos, 1968-NMSC-177, 79 N.M. 611, 447 P.2d 20.\n\nSelection of charges.— Where defendant was alleged to have stolen $400 in quarters from a change machine by using a rigged bill, he is potentially subject to being charged with both larceny and the misdemeanor offense of cheating a machine or device, and the preemption rationale of the general-specific rule did not preclude prosecution under either or both of the statutes.State v. Davis, 2000-NMCA-105, 129 N.M. 773, 14 P.3d 38, cert. denied, 130 N.M. 17, 16 P.3d 442.\n\nCharging in alternative.— An indictment under Laws 1884, ch. 47, § 15 (former 40-4-17, 1953 Comp.), relating to larceny, embezzlement or killing of animals, could charge that accused committed the crime in each of the specified ways, so long as they were not repugnant.State v. McKinley, 1924-NMSC-052, 30 N.M. 54, 227 P. 757.\n\nSome single offenses were of a nature to be committed by many means, and a count was not necessarily double which charged several of the means, if they were not repugnant.Territory v. Harrington, 1912-NMSC-006, 17 N.M. 62, 121 P. 613;see alsoTerritory v. Eaton, 1905-NMSC-011, 13 N.M. 79, 79 P. 713.\n\nAdditional details surplusage.— Information charging defendant with stealing a washing machine belonging to a certain company, from the company warehouse, of the value of $300, which used the term \"grand larceny\" and referred to the statutory section defining grand larceny, sufficiently charged defendant of the crime of grand larceny, and not larceny from a warehouse, as defendant contended; the additional averment that the machine was stolen from the company's warehouse was surplusage, its effect, if any, being merely to place an additional burden on the state in proving the case.State v. Johnson, 1955-NMSC-070, 60 N.M. 57, 287 P.2d 247.\n\nVariance not jurisdictional.— In conviction for burglary and larceny, variance between indictment and proof regarding name and address of victim was not jurisdictional and was cured by jury's guilty verdict.State v. Jaramillo, 1973-NMCA-029, 85 N.M. 19, 508 P.2d 1316, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 5, 508 P.2d 1302, and cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1000, 94 S. Ct. 353, 38 L. Ed. 2d 236 (1973).\n\n\"Criminal complaint\" insufficient to confer jurisdiction.— Order revoking a suspended sentence given defendant on a plea of guilty to charges of burglary and grand larceny contained in a \"criminal complaint\" filed by sheriff must be reversed, as the defendant's sentence was imposed without jurisdiction in the court, due to lack of a proper charge against him.State v. Chacon, 1957-NMSC-030, 62 N.M. 291, 309 P.2d 230.\n\nDesignation of crime in bond.— A recognizance which described the alleged offense against the principal as \"having sold and thereby deprived the owner thereof of a horse, the same being the crime of larceny\" sufficiently designated the crime to bind the sureties on the bond or recognizance.Territory v. Minter, 1907-NMSC-002, 14 N.M. 6, 88 P. 1130.\n\nV. EVIDENCE.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nProof of venue.— Venue, like any other fact in a case, could be proven by circumstantial evidence.State v. Lott, 1936-NMSC-024, 40 N.M. 147, 56 P.2d 1029;State v. Mares, 1921-NMSC-048, 27 N.M. 212, 199 P. 111.\n\nInference of intent to steal.— An intent to steal was an element to be inferred by the jury from the facts and circumstances established upon the trial. Such an inference might be drawn from facts showing that property was taken in one county and driven through several others and kept for 10 or 12 days before it was found and retaken by its owner.State v. McKinley, 1924-NMSC-052, 30 N.M. 54, 227 P. 757.\n\nExhibit relevant to intent.— Fifty foot cotton rope with pipe T's on one end taken from defendant's car, which was identified as device capable of being used in larceny of signal wire, was relevant and material to preparation and intent of defendant, even though there was no evidence that in fact the exhibit was so used.State v. Hardison, 1970-NMCA-043, 81 N.M. 430, 467 P.2d 1002.\n\nExtra-judicial statements inadmissible.— In prosecution for larceny of scrap metal, defendant's out-of-court statements to witness that codefendant had bought some junk and that he (defendant) was going to haul the junk were properly disallowed as self-serving, and were not admissible as part of res gestae since proffered testimony of witness did not show that they were contemporaneous with a shocked condition or were spontaneous.State v. Hunt, 1972-NMCA-055, 83 N.M. 753, 497 P.2d 755, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 740, 497 P.2d 742.\n\nB. LARCENY OF LIVESTOCK.\n\nCircumstantial evidence.— In prosecution for larceny of cattle, the corpus delicti could be proved by circumstantial evidence.State v. Ortega, 1932-NMSC-003, 36 N.M. 57, 7 P.2d 943.\n\nDirect evidence of nonconsent of the owner to the killing of an animal was not required as a matter of law, and such nonconsent could be shown by circumstantial evidence.State v. Parry, 1920-NMSC-096, 26 N.M. 469, 194 P. 864.\n\nEstablishing animal's identity.— It was equally as competent to establish the identity of a stolen animal by a brand as by its color or by any distinguishing mark.Territory v. Valles, 1909-NMSC-026, 15 N.M. 228, 103 P. 984.\n\nProof of ownership.— Where indictment alleged that animal unlawfully killed was the property of copartners, it was necessary to prove the ownership as laid out in the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt.Territory v. Sais, 1909-NMSC-021, 15 N.M. 171, 103 P. 980.\n\nWhen brand required as evidence.— Only when the evidence of ownership of animals depended upon a brand was it necessary to introduce a certified copy of the recorded brand in evidence.State v. Meeks, 1919-NMSC-015, 25 N.M. 231, 180 P. 295.\n\nBrand not conclusive.— In prosecution for larceny of a steer, the brand was but prima facie evidence of ownership, and did not prevent prosecution from introducing other evidence of true ownership of animal at time of offense.Chavez v. Territory, 1892-NMSC-014, 6 N.M. 455, 30 P. 903.\n\nBrand not conclusive proof of ownership.— Proof that calf bore defendant's brand in prosecution for stealing and branding the animal did not constitute prima facie evidence that defendants owned the animal, under statute providing that registration in brand book under seal of the cattle sanitary board (now New Mexico livestock board) constituted prima facie proof that person owning the recorded brand was owner of animal branded with such brand.State v. Reed, 1951-NMSC-021, 55 N.M. 231, 230 P.2d 966), cert. denied, 342 U.S. 932, 72 S. Ct. 374, 96 L. Ed. 694 (1952).\n\nDisposal of meat as part of res gestae.— In prosecution for larceny of cattle, evidence as to hogs eating beef at ranch of a defendant was properly admitted as part of res gestae.Territory v. Leslie, 1910-NMSC-002, 15 N.M. 240, 106 P. 378.\n\nPrima facie case.— In prosecution for larceny of cattle, proof of ownership in alleged owner, that the cattle were stolen, that shortly thereafter they were found near the ranch of defendant, bearing his brand, freshly put on, and that he then claimed to own them, was sufficient prima facie proof of an unlawful taking and asportation, and made a prima facie case of larceny, although other cattle of the owner grazed in the same locality where the stolen cattle were found.State v. Liston, 1921-NMSC-104, 27 N.M. 500, 202 P. 696.\n\nIn prosecution for larceny of mule, testimony tending to establish identity of mule, ownership by named person as administrator, and possession of mule by defendant was enough to make out a prima facie case of guilt.Territory v. Valles, 1909-NMSC-026, 15 N.M. 228, 103 P. 984.\n\nOffense established.— Evidence of discovery of two calves belonging to others in weaning pen of ranch on which the defendant was foreman, along with other circumstances, afforded adequate support for larceny conviction.State v. Compton, 1953-NMSC-036, 57 N.M. 227, 257 P.2d 915.\n\nConviction justified.— Possession of hide, ears and hoofs of heifer stolen from ranch, and their concealment, together with other circumstances, justified conviction for the theft.State v. Lott, 1936-NMSC-024, 40 N.M. 147, 56 P.2d 1029.\n\nTestimony of owner admissible.— An owner's testimony regarding the value of an item stolen is admissible and sufficient to withstand a motion for a directed verdict based on lack of evidence of value.State v. Romero, 1975-NMCA-017, 87 N.M. 279, 532 P.2d 208.\n\nStore owner's calculations.— Testimony of store owner in the form of direct evidence of items taken and their value, based upon his own knowledge and a calculation of the value of the items stolen by determining how many items were in the bins before the theft and how many were left, was substantial evidence as to the value of the goods stolen.State v. Landlee, 1973-NMCA-143, 85 N.M. 726, 516 P.2d 697.\n\nCost of television set.— Evidence that stolen television set was purchased new in March or April prior to the December it was stolen, that the purchase price was $750 and that it was \"working all right\" before it was stolen, was substantial evidence of value, and further, as defendant elicited this information on cross-examination, he was not in a position to complain about it.State v. Phillips, 1971-NMCA-114, 83 N.M. 5, 487 P.2d 915.\n\nValue of checks.— Defendant was not entitled to an instruction on fourth degree larceny as a lesser included offense of third degree larceny on the grounds that the $3,200 in checks he stole were neither endorsed nor stamped and therefore worthless. The value of a check, in the absence of proof to show a lesser value, is measured by what the owner of the check could expect to receive for the check at the time of the theft, i.e. the check's face value.Gallegos v. State, 1992-NMSC-014, 113 N.M. 339, 825 P.2d 1249.\n\nMarket value.— Testimony of expert witnesses that a fair market value of stolen scrap metal was in excess of $100 constituted substantial evidence to support conviction of defendants for larceny of property worth over $100.State v. Hunt, 1972-NMCA-055, 83 N.M. 753, 497 P.2d 755, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 740, 497 P.2d 742.\n\nCost or replacement value distinguished.— In prosecution for larceny of a plow, where jury was instructed to determine market value thereof, jury was not warranted in considering its cost or replacement value.State v. Gallegos, 1957-NMSC-052, 63 N.M. 57, 312 P.2d 1067.\n\nEvidence sufficient.— Testimony that part of the item stolen, if it was considered as scrap, was worth $30, that its replacement cost was $110 and that its market value was $170 to $180 was sufficient for a conviction under this statute for larceny of an item in excess of $100 but less than $2500.State v. Landlee, 1973-NMCA-112, 85 N.M. 449, 513 P.2d 186.\n\nD. SUFFICIENCY.\n\nIdentification adequate.— Where victim and witness of robbery perpetrated by two masked men described, on the night of the robbery, the robber and the clothes he was wearing, and at trial identified clothes found in defendant's apartment and defendant himself on basis of his posture, size and stoop, there was sufficient evidence to establish that defendant was one of the men involved in the robbery.State v. Quintana, 1961-NMSC-108, 69 N.M. 51, 364 P.2d 120;see alsoState v. Montano, 1961-NMSC-174, 69 N.M. 332, 367 P.2d 95.\n\nExclusion of every reasonable hypothesis save guilt.— Circumstantial evidence of defendant's aiding or abetting larceny was substantial and did not fail to exclude every reasonable hypothesis other than defendant's guilt, where he changed positions in car containing stolen property and helped reload a television set which fell off the roof of the vehicle, which actions excluded the defense hypothesis that defendant was asleep and knew nothing about the larceny.State v. Phillips, 1971-NMCA-114, 83 N.M. 5, 487 P.2d 915.\n\nIn prosecution for larceny of signal wire, tracks from car belonging to codefendant and along line of cut wire, which were shown to match those made by defendant's boots, along with unexplained flight from the scene and removal of some cut wire about 100 feet in the direction of the car excluded every reasonable hypothesis other than guilt.State v. Hardison, 1970-NMCA-043, 81 N.M. 430, 467 P.2d 1002.\n\n\"Exclusive\" possession.— If the unexplained possession of stolen property found in defendant's apartment was within his \"exclusive\" possession, that circumstance coupled with other culpatory and incriminating circumstances is sufficient to sustain conviction of larceny.State v. Flores, 1966-NMSC-059, 76 N.M. 134, 412 P.2d 560.\n\nThe \"exclusive\" possession which creates an inference of guilt does not mean that the possession must be separate from all others provided there is other evidence to connect the defendant with the offense.State v. Flores, 1966-NMSC-059, 76 N.M. 134, 412 P.2d 560.\n\nProof of ownership.— In prosecuting larceny, the state need not prove ownership in a particular person; proof that the property belonged to someone other than the defendant is sufficient.State v. Brown, 1992-NMCA-028, 113 N.M. 631, 830 P.2d 183, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 636, 830 P.2d 553.\n\nSale of property.— While something more than possession alone must be shown to establish corpus delicti of larceny, where ring owned by woman was relinquished by her to jailer when she was confined in jail in which defendant was a trustee and defendant had the ring in his possession afterwards and sold it to another, the corpus delicti of larceny was established by circumstantial evidence.State v. Buchanan, 1966-NMSC-045, 76 N.M. 141, 412 P.2d 565.\n\nEvidence that defendant employee took property belonging to corporate owner from the business where it had been repaired, sold the property to a third person and retained the proceeds of the sale, and that defendant had no authority either to obtain possession of the property or to sell it, was evidence of an unlawful taking with the requisite intent.State v. Robertson, 1977-NMCA-044, 90 N.M. 382, 563 P.2d 1175, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nTaking money from lounge constituted larcenyeven where the person defendant took the money from was employed at the lounge, had custody of the money, and consented to the taking of the money, since the money belonged to the owner, not the employee and even if the employee had turned the money over to the defendant willingly, she had no authority to do so.State v. Rhea, 1974-NMCA-030, 86 N.M. 291, 523 P.2d 26, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 281, 523 P.2d 16.\n\nSufficient evidence to support conviction,despite failure to preserve fingerprints or trace ownership of weapon.State v. Peterson, 1985-NMCA-109, 103 N.M. 638, 711 P.2d 915, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1052, 106 S. Ct. 1279, 89 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1986).\n\nSufficient evidence to support conviction for larceny over $20,000.— Where defendant was convicted of larceny over $20,000 and burglary in connection with money stolen from a home improvement store in Farmington, New Mexico, where defendant formerly worked as a department manager, and where, at trial, the state presented video surveillance of the incident that showed an individual wearing \"all black\" using a key to enter the store through the front doors, disable the alarm system, enter the office, unlock a code-protected safe, take cash from the safe, and leave the store in a little over two minutes, and where defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support his larceny conviction because witnesses could not agree on the exact amount that had been taken and that the amount taken was not established by documentary evidence, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for larceny over $20,000 where the state presented testimony from a security officer and the investigating officer regarding the amount that was stolen. Although the two witnesses did not agree on the exact amount that had been taken, both witnesses testified that over $20,000 had been stolen from the home improvement store.State v. Stalter, 2023-NMCA-054, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence to support retrial for larceny.— When reviewing whether sufficient evidence exists to support retrial, an appellate court includes in its review any erroneously admitted evidence, and if all the evidence, including the wrongfully admitted evidence, is sufficient, then retrial following appeal is not barred.State v. Winters, 2015-NMCA-050, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-004.\n\nFollowing reversal of defendant's conviction for larceny over $2,500, the court of appeals held that the evidence that defendant's truck was found at the scene with the stolen property in the bed of the truck, combined with the erroneously admitted arresting officer's opinion that shoe prints found at the scene matched shoe prints found at defendant's residence, was sufficient to permit the jury to reasonably infer that defendant was at the scene and committed the theft; defendant is subject to retrial on remand.State v. Winters, 2015-NMCA-050, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-004.\n\nEvidence insufficient.— Evidence that smooth soled tracks were found between area where wire was being larcenously cut and car belonging to one defendant, and that woman within the car was wearing smooth soled moccasins, where no attempt to match moccasins to tracks was made, was insufficient to exclude every reasonable hypothesis other than her guilt.State v. Hardison, 1970-NMCA-043, 81 N.M. 430, 467 P.2d 1002.\n\nWhere proof relied upon to establish defendant's guilt of breaking and entering and larceny was purely circumstantial and not incompatible with innocence on any rational theory, or incapable of explanation on any reasonable hypothesis, it was error for the court not to have directed a verdict of acquittal at the close of the state's case.State v. Campos, 1968-NMSC-177, 79 N.M. 611, 447 P.2d 20.\n\nInsufficient evidence that value of stolen property over $2,500.State v. Seward, 1986-NMCA-062, 104 N.M. 548, 724 P.2d 756, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 522, 724 P.2d 231.\n\nInsufficient evidence of intent to permanently deprive owner of stolen items.— Where defendant was convicted of larceny based on DNA evidence found in a burglarized house, there was insufficient evidence to permit a rational jury to find the essential facts to establish each element of the crime of larceny beyond a reasonable doubt, because although there was evidence that defendant had entered the property without authorization, the state, without presenting any evidence linking defendant to the stolen items, failed to establish, either directly or by circumstantial evidence, that defendant took or carried away the stolen items with the specific intent to permanently deprive the owner of those items.State v. Ledbetter, 2020-NMCA-046.\n\nVI. INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nIntent.— Where on appeal it was contended an error occurred for the district court to give a general intent instruction without instructing the jury that it did not apply to a specific intent crime, because the instruction substantially followed the applicable law, there was no fundamental error.State v. Gee, 2004-NMCA-042, 135 N.M. 408, 89 P.3d 80, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-003, 135 N.M. 321, 88 P.3d 261.\n\nError in time period charged harmless.— Where crime of grand larceny was charged as having been committed on February 15, 1953, the information charging theft of a washing machine over the value of $20.00 was filed January 4, 1954, and meanwhile the statute defining the crime was amended on June 12, 1953, by substituting $50.00 in lieu of $20.00, fact that the court's instructions permitted jury to find that the offense had occurred on February 18, 1953, or at any time within the three years next preceding the date the information was filed was harmless, as the evidence conclusively showed that the offense had occurred prior to the effective date of the amendment, and moreover, the error was waived.State v. Johnson, 1955-NMSC-070, 60 N.M. 57, 287 P.2d 247.\n\nIncorrect identification of victim not fundamental error.— Instructions to which defendant in prosecution for burglary and larceny made no objection, incorrectly setting forth the name and address of the victim, did not constitute fundamental error.State v. Jaramillo, 1973-NMCA-029, 85 N.M. 19, 508 P.2d 1316, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 5, 508 P.2d 1302, and cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1000, 94 S. Ct. 353, 38 L. Ed. 2d 236 (1973).\n\nCharge on circumstantial evidence proper.— Instruction on circumstantial evidence concerning the stealing and unlawful branding of a bull calf was not erroneous because of inclusion of statement \"that before you would be authorized to find a verdict of guilty against the defendant where the evidence is circumstantial, the facts and circumstances shown in the evidence must be incompatible upon any reasonable hypothesis with the innocence of the defendant and incapable of explanation upon any reasonable hypothesis other than that of the guilt of the defendant.\"State v. Reed, 1951-NMSC-021, 55 N.M. 231, 230 P.2d 966, cert. denied, 342 U.S. 932, 72 S. Ct. 374, 96 L. Ed. 694 (1952).\n\nCumulative instruction.— The court was not required to give instruction on circumstantial evidence which was cumulative.State v. Reed, 1951-NMSC-021, 55 N.M. 231, 230 P.2d 966, cert. denied, 342 U.S. 932, 72 S. Ct. 374, 96 L. Ed. 694 (1952).\n\nInstruction on larceny by employee incorrect.— Defendant's requested instruction which told the jury that if the defendant was an employee of the corporate owner and as such had the right to have the possession of the equipment in question, then even though he sold said equipment without authority, he was not guilty of larceny, was an incorrect statement of the law because it failed to recognize that defendant's physical control of the equipment was no more than custody on behalf of an employer who retained possession.State v. Robertson, 1977-NMCA-044, 90 N.M. 382, 563 P.2d 1175, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nLarceny as included offense.— Because robbery is an aggravated larceny, so that larceny is necessarily included within the offense of robbery, defendant had the right to have instructions on larceny submitted to the jury, since there was evidence from several defense witnesses which tended to establish that offense.State v. Wingate, 1975-NMCA-035, 87 N.M. 397, 534 P.2d 776.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Confusing Law of Criminal Intent in New Mexico,\" see 5 N.M.L.

      "text": "Robbery consists of the theft of anything of value from the person of another or from the immediate control of another, by use or threatened use of force or violence.\n\nWhoever commits robbery is guilty of a third degree felony.\n\nWhoever commits robbery while armed with a deadly weapon is, for the first offense, guilty of a second degree felony and, for second and subsequent offenses, is guilty of a first degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-16-2, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 16-2; 1973, ch. 178, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For definition of deadly weapon,see30-1-12 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor aggravated assault,see30-3-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor assault with intent to commit a violent felony,see30-3-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nSpecification of \"anything of value\".— Because the use of the phrase \"anything of value\" in Section 30-16-2 NMSA 1978 to describe the stolen property does not specify what type of property theft will be punished, the state's legal theory of the crime supplies the \"anything of value\" element of robbery in cases where that crime is charged.State v. Gutierrez, 2011-NMSC-024, 150 N.M. 232, 258 P.3d 1024.\n\nSpecification of \"anything of value\" resulted in double jeopardy.— Where the child was charged with armed robbery for taking both an automobile and the keys to the automobile in violation of Section 30-16-2 NMSA 1978 and for the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle in violation of Section 30-16D-1 NMSA 1978, the child's conduct underlying both crimes was unitary; and both convictions required the same proof of the theft of the automobile, the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle conviction was subsumed by the robbery conviction and the child's conviction for both resulted in double jeopardy.State v. Gutierrez, 2011-NMSC-024, 150 N.M. 232, 258 P.3d 1024.\n\nCrime of violence.— The district court properly included defendant's state robbery conviction as a violent felony under 18 U.S.C. § 924, the Armed Career Criminal Act.United States v. Lujan, 9 F.3d 890 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nIncreased penalty provision strictly construed.— A more severe punishment on conviction for a second offense is deemed highly penal and therefore must be strictly construed.State v. Garcia, 1978-NMSC-039, 91 N.M. 664, 579 P.2d 790.\n\nEnhanced sentence not double jeopardy.— Validly increasing a defendant's sentence after conviction according to the provisions of the enhancement statute does not amount to double jeopardy.State v. Stout, 1981-NMSC-045, 96 N.M. 29, 627 P.2d 871.\n\nSentencing statutes not conflicting.— Former Section 31-18-4 NMSA 1978 does not conflict with this section in providing that the first year of the statutory sentence for a felony, other than a capital felony, in commission of which a firearm was used, shall not be suspended; the two statutes are in harmony, each expressing a separate legislative intent.State v. Wilkins, 1975-NMCA-069, 88 N.M. 116, 537 P.2d 1012, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 319, 540 P.2d 249 (decided under prior law, statute repealed).\n\nEven though this section provides an increased penalty for second or subsequent armed robberies, it does not conflict with the Habitual Offender Statute, 31-18-5 NMSA 1978 (now repealed), which applies only to a current felony \"not otherwise punishable by death or life imprisonment,\" since second or subsequent armed robberies are punishable by life imprisonment.State v. Roland, 1977-NMCA-043, 90 N.M. 520, 565 P.2d 1037, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486 (decided under prior law, statute repealed).\n\nHabitual Offender Statute, 31-18-5 NMSA 1978 (now repealed), does not apply to second or subsequent armed robberies.State v. Roland, 1977-NMCA-043, 90 N.M. 520, 565 P.2d 1037, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486 (decided under prior law, statute repealed).\n\nIntent of provision.— The fact that the defendant was convicted in one criminal proceeding of two armed robberies charged under separate counts of one indictment was not sufficient to invoke the increased penalty provision of this section, which is intended to serve as a warning to first offenders and to provide increased punishment for those who persist in violations of the law after having been formally convicted.State v. Garcia, 1978-NMSC-039, 91 N.M. 664, 579 P.2d 790.\n\nWhen enhanced penalty proper.— Any armed robbery offense committed subsequent to a conviction for armed robbery is a first degree felony calling for the enhanced penalty contemplated by this section.State v. Garcia, 1978-NMSC-039, 91 N.M. 664, 579 P.2d 790.\n\nPretrial notice of enhanced sentence not required.— The state is not required to give a defendant notice before trial on the substantive offense that enhancement may be sought after conviction. By filing a pleading seeking to enhance the defendant's sentence after conviction, the state complies with due process requirements.State v. Stout, 1981-NMSC-045, 96 N.M. 29, 627 P.2d 871.\n\nII. MULTIPLE PROSECUTIONS OR PUNISHMENTS.\n\nSingle intent not applicable to robbery.— Robbery is not merely a property crime, but a crime against a person and the robbery statute is designed to protect citizens from violence and to punish the use of violence. The legislature intended to allow separate charges for each individual against whom violence or the threat of violence is separately used. The unit of prosecution for robbery is not based on the defendant's intent.State v. Bernal, 2006-NMSC-050, 140 N.M. 644, 146 P.3d 289.\n\nSeparate and discrete acts.— Where defendant had the intent to steal only one victim's property, but used separate and discrete acts of force and threats of force against two victims in an attempt to obtain that property, multiple attempted robbery charges do not violate double jeopardy.State v. Bernal, 2006-NMSC-050, 140 N.M. 644, 146 P.3d 289.\n\nSingle or multiple thefts.— Where property is stolen from the same owner and from the same place by a series of acts, if each taking is the result of a separate, independent impulse, each is a separate crime; but if the successive takings are all pursuant to a single, sustained criminal impulse and in execution of a general fraudulent scheme, they together constitute a single larceny, regardless of the time which may elapse between each act.State v. Allen, 1955-NMSC-015, 59 N.M. 139, 280 P.2d 298.\n\nQuestion for jury.— Whether acts of defendant and companions in stealing victim's vodka and later returning, whipping victim and stealing money, constituted two offenses or only one was a question of fact for the jury under instructions to disregard testimony of more than one taking if they found the takings constituted separate offenses.State v. Allen, 1955-NMSC-015, 59 N.M. 139, 280 P.2d 298.\n\nTwo convictions for one conspiracy unconstitutional.— Because the defendant robbed two different victims but only one conspiracy to commit the robberies existed, it was violation of double jeopardy to convict the defendant for two conspiracies, as he was punished twice for the same offense.State v. Jackson, 1993-NMCA-092, 116 N.M. 130, 860 P.2d 772, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 795, 858 P.2d 1274.\n\nCharge of larceny is necessarily included in charge of robbery.State v. Eckles, 1968-NMSC-079, 79 N.M. 138, 441 P.2d 36.\n\nLegislative intent for separate punishments.— As each offense includes one statutory element not included in the other, the presumption is that the legislature intended to punish separately the two offenses of aggravated assault and armed robbery.State v. Armijo, 2005-NMCA-010, 136 N.M. 723, 104 P.3d 1114.\n\nAttempted robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery.— Convictions for attempted robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery did not violate the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.State v. Carrasco, 1997-NMSC-047, 124 N.M. 64, 946 P.2d 1075.\n\nUnitary conduct in commission of murder and robbery.— Since the defendant's conduct in stabbing and robbing a cabdriver was unitary, the elements of armed robbery were subsumed by the elements of felony murder in the course of an armed robbery and conviction and sentencing of the defendant for both felony murder and the underlying felony of armed robbery violated double jeopardy.State v. Contreras, 1995-NMSC-056, 120 N.M. 486, 903 P.2d 228.\n\nDouble jeopardy.—State v. Maes, 1983-NMCA-073, 100 N.M. 78, 665 P.2d 1169 is no longer considered to be controlling authority, because the analysis contained therein predates, and has been replaced by, the two-pronged analysis ofSwafford v. State, 1991-NMSC-043, 112 N.M. 3, 810 P.2d 1223 for determining whether a defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy is violated by his convictions.State v. Armijo, 2005-NMCA-010, 136 N.M. 723, 104 P.3d 1114.\n\nConvictions for felony murder and robbery, because they arise out of unitary conduct, violate the defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy.State v. Duffy, 1998-NMSC-014, 126 N.M. 132, 967 P.2d 807.\n\nWhere armed robbery provided the underlying felony for defendant's first degree murder conviction, the elements of the former crime were subsumed within the elements of the murder offense and, therefore, reversal of defendant's conviction and sentence for armed robbery was required.State v. Foster, 1999-NMSC-007, 126 N.M. 646, 974 P.2d 140.\n\nPlaintiff who was convicted in a justice of the peace court (now replaced by magistrate courts) of petty misdemeanor of receiving stolen property, and was later convicted in the district court of the second degree felony of armed robbery, was not placed in double jeopardy, and the state was not barred or estopped from prosecuting and convicting him for the armed robbery.State v. Gleason, 1969-NMCA-054, 80 N.M. 382, 456 P.2d 215.\n\nThe defendant's acts of taking truck keys and using them to drive the truck away supported separate convictions for armed robbery and unlawful taking of a vehicle, and his double jeopardy right to be free from multiple punishment was not violated by his sentence for unlawful taking.State v. McGruder, 1997-NMSC-023, 123 N.M. 302, 940 P.2d 150.\n\nGrand larceny and armed robbery merged.— Where the act of grand larceny was necessary to, or incidental to, the crime of armed robbery which the defendant committed, the offense of grand larceny was merged with the graver offense of armed robbery, and hence although the defendant was properly convicted of both armed robbery and grand larceny, he could not be doubly punished for both of those crimes.State v. Quintana, 1961-NMSC-108, 69 N.M. 51, 364 P.2d 120;State v. Montano, 1961-NMSC-174, 69 N.M. 332, 367 P.2d 95.\n\nOffense of receiving stolen property cannot be included within armed robbery.State v. Mares, 1968-NMCA-042, 79 N.M. 327, 442 P.2d 817.\n\nNo bar to subsequent prosecution.— The facts necessary to sustain a conviction of receiving stolen property could not possibly sustain a conviction of armed robbery, which is essential to make a prior conviction a bar to a subsequent prosecution and conviction for a greater offense.State v. Mares, 1968-NMCA-042, 79 N.M. 327, 442 P.2d 817.\n\nThe fact that defendant pleaded guilty, or at least indicated his guilt and was thereupon convicted of receiving stolen property, which property later turned out to be a portion of the property taken by him in the armed robbery, in no way clothed him with immunity from being charged, tried and convicted of the far more serious offense of which he was guilty.State v. Mares, 1968-NMCA-042, 79 N.M. 327, 442 P.2d 817.\n\nNo bar to dual punishments.— The offenses of receiving stolen property and armed robbery fail to fall within the prohibition against punishment for more than one offense because the criminal intent essential to the felony of armed robbery is not an essential element of the petty misdemeanor of receiving stolen property.State v. Mares, 1968-NMCA-042, 79 N.M. 327, 442 P.2d 817.\n\nMerger with aggravated battery.— Aggravated battery merges with a robbery offense when the defendant's intent to take a victim's purse includes an intent to injure the victim.State v. Gammil, 1989-NMCA-005, 108 N.M. 208, 769 P.2d 1299,overruled in part on other grounds,State v. Fuentes, 1994-NMCA-158, 119 N.M. 104, 888 P.2d 986, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 168, 889 P.2d 203 (1995).\n\nOffense of aggravated battery did not merge with armed robbery.State v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-026, 90 N.M. 260, 561 P.2d 1353, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nSeparate punishment for armed robbery and aggravated battery is consistent with legislative intent and does not constitute double jeopardy.State v. Fuentes, 1994-NMCA-158, 119 N.M. 104, 888 P.2d 986, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 168, 889 P.2d 203 (1995).\n\nAggravated battery does not constitute lesser included offense.— The concept of lesser included offenses is not involved in a prosecution for armed robbery and aggravated battery because either offense can be committed without committing the other offense.State v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-026, 90 N.M. 260, 561 P.2d 1353, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nElements of aggravated battery and armed robbery differ.— Since taking the victim's purse was a fact required to be proved under the armed robbery charge, but not under the aggravated battery charge, and application of force was a fact required to be proved under the aggravated battery charge, while threatened use of force would be acceptable proof under the armed robbery charge, the elements of the two crimes were not the same.State v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-026, 90 N.M. 260, 561 P.2d 1353, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nSentences for robbery and aggravated burglary proper.— Since theft is a necessary element of robbery but it is not necessarily involved in aggravated burglary, which requires only the element of intent to commit felony or theft, while an unauthorized entry is an element of aggravated burglary but not of robbery, the crimes did not involve the same elements, and therefore, defendant could be sentenced for each of these crimes.State v. Ranne, 1969-NMCA-029, 80 N.M. 188, 453 P.2d 209.\n\nConsecutive sentences for armed robbery and false imprisonment were proper;since the elements of the two crimes are dissimilar and the evidence required to establish each crime is independent, it was clear the crimes did not merge even when considered in light of the facts.State v. Moore, 1989-NMCA-073, 109 N.M. 119, 782 P.2d 91, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 54, 781 P.2d 782;State v. Ibarra, 1993-NMCA-040, 116 N.M. 486, 864 P.2d 302, cert. quashed, 117 N.M. 744, 877 P.2d 44 (1994), and cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1157, 115 S. Ct. 1116, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1080 (1995).\n\nRobbery of money and unlawful taking of vehicle not merged.— Unlawful taking of a vehicle in violation of 64-9-4A, 1953 Comp., was not a necessary ingredient of offense of robbery of money by use or threatened use of force and violence; hence, defendant committed two separate and distinct criminal offenses, and the fact that they were committed on the same day, or even that one succeeded the other as part of one episode of criminal activity, did not cause them to merge.State v. Eckles, 1968-NMSC-079, 79 N.M. 138, 441 P.2d 36 (decided under prior law, statute repealed).\n\nConvictions for robbery and battery against a household member did not violate double jeopardy.— Where defendant, who was a former employee of a restaurant, had an intimate romantic relationship with the victim who was the assistant manager of the restaurant; under the guise of returning the victim's cell phone, defendant approached the victim outside the restaurant, grabbed two money bags containing receipts of the restaurant that the victim intended to deposit; and when defendant grabbed the money bags, defendant struck the victim in the face and fled the scene, defendant's conviction for robbery and battery against a household member did not violate double jeopardy.State v. Gutierrez, 2012-NMCA-095, 286 P.3d 608, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-008.\n\nIII. ELEMENTS OF OFFENSE.\n\nCriminal intent.— Theft is an element of the crime of robbery and it includes the concept of criminal intent.State v. Nelson, 1971-NMCA-152, 83 N.M. 269, 490 P.2d 1242, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 259, 490 P.2d 1232.\n\nAggravated assault and armed robbery distinguished.— Aggravated assault contains an element that armed robbery does not: striking at a victim instead of just threatening him. Armed robbery contains an element that aggravated assault does not: taking victim's property with the intent to permanently deprive victim of the property.State v. Armijo, 2005-NMCA-010, 136 N.M. 723, 104 P.3d 1114.\n\nIntent to steal.— A specific criminal intent, the intent to steal, is an essential element of the crime of robbery, and the use or threatened use of force or violence does not eliminate such an intent as an element of that crime.State v. Puga, 1973-NMCA-079, 85 N.M. 204, 510 P.2d 1075.\n\nElement of \"carrying away\" may be satisfied without actual possession.— The instant that a cashier, under coercion from the defendant, removes money from a cash register, the element of \"carrying away\" the money is satisfied, even though the defendant is apprehended prior to his actually taking possession of the money.State v. Williams, 1982-NMSC-041, 97 N.M. 634, 642 P.2d 1093, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 845, 103 S. Ct. 101, 74 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1982).\n\nLarceny plus force.— The presence of violence, actual or constructive, is an essential ingredient of robbery, but not of larceny, so that robbery is a compound or aggravated larceny, composed of the crime of larceny from the person with the aggravation of force, actual or constructive, used in the taking.State v. Wingate, 1975-NMCA-035, 87 N.M. 397, 534 P.2d 776.\n\nUse or threatened use of force is essential elementof robbery under this section.State v. Martinez, 1973-NMCA-120, 85 N.M. 468, 513 P.2d 402.\n\nArmed robbery.— Armed robbery may involve the use of force or the threat of force.State v. Armijo, 2005-NMCA-010, 136 N.M. 723, 104 P.3d 1114.\n\nForce or intimidation is gist of offenseunder this section.State v. Sanchez, 1967-NMCA-009, 78 N.M. 284, 430 P.2d 781.\n\nAmount or degree of force is not determinative factorin establishing the use of force in robbery.State v. Martinez, 1973-NMCA-120, 85 N.M. 468, 513 P.2d 402;State v. Segura, 1970-NMCA-066, 81 N.M. 673, 472 P.2d 387, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 669, 472 P.2d 383.\n\nCompulsion the issue.— Where force is charged under this section, the issue is not how much force was used, but whether the force was sufficient to compel the victim to part with his property.State v. Sanchez, 1967-NMCA-009, 78 N.M. 284, 430 P.2d 781.\n\nForce or intimidation is gist of offense.— Under this section the force or fear must be the moving cause inducing the victim to part unwillingly with his property.State v. Sanchez, 1967-NMCA-009, 78 N.M. 284, 430 P.2d 781.\n\nAmount or degree of force is not determinative factor.— The use or threatened use of force or violence is not, in and by itself, sufficient to sustain a conviction for robbery; it must be the lever by which the thing of value is separated from the person or immediate control of another.State v. Baca, 1971-NMCA-142, 83 N.M. 184, 489 P.2d 1182;see alsoState v. Martinez, 1973-NMCA-120, 85 N.M. 468, 513 P.2d 402.\n\nImplicit threat.— Neither statutory language nor case law limit the term \"threat\" to explicit, verbal threats of force.State v. Hernandez, 2003-NMCA-131, 134 N.M. 510, 79 P.3d 1118, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-002, 134 N.M. 723, 82 P.3d 533.\n\nForce used for mere escape not sufficient.— Under the facts of the present case, the victim's money was removed and separated from his person by stealth, and the defendant's use of a weapon only after the money was separated from the victim was merely an action to hold victim at bay as he escaped from the motel. The use of force to retain property or to facilitate escape does not satisfy the force element necessary for the crime of robbery. Thus, there was insufficient evidence to support the defendant's conviction for armed robbery.State v. Lewis, 1993-NMCA-165, 116 N.M. 849, 867 P.2d 1231.\n\nIntimidating reasonable man.— Under this section where fear or intimidation is charged, it is necessary to show that the circumstances were such as to cause a reasonable man to apprehend danger and that he could be reasonably expected to give up his property in order to protect himself.State v. Sanchez, 1967-NMCA-009, 78 N.M. 284, 430 P.2d 781.\n\nAssault and putting in fear.— It was not necessary that the assault be \"with force and violence,\" if it was done by \"assault and putting in fear.\"Territory v. Abeita, 1873-NMSC-001, 1 N.M. 545 (decided under prior law).\n\nArmed robbery is not offense distinct from robbery;the offense is robbery whether or not armed, and whether or not one is an accessory; \"armed robbery\" is a way to commit \"robbery\" and, if done in that way, the penalty is greater but the basic offense remains robbery.State v. Roque, 1977-NMCA-094, 91 N.M. 7, 569 P.2d 417, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 4, 569 P.2d 414.\n\nRobbery of a deceased person.— Where defendant, with the assistance of others, robbed and then killed the victim, left the scene only to return several hours later to empty the victim's pocket of cash and pour gasoline throughout the residence and on the victim's body and set the residence on fire, defendant was properly convicted under the robbery statute for the second robbery, because the principle of law that one cannot be guilty of robbery if the victim is a deceased person does not apply where a robbery and homicide are a part of the same transaction and are so interwoven with each other as to be inseparable, and it is reasonable to conclude that defendant's second robbery and the subsequent arson were directly connected with the original robbery and killing, and therefore the second robbery can rationally be linked to the murder that enabled the robbery.State v. Montoya, 2017-NMCA-033, cert. denied.\n\nDegree of force a jury issue.— The question of whether or not the snatching of the purse from the victim was accompanied by sufficient force to constitute robbery is a factual determination, within the province of the jury's discretion.State v. Clokey, 1976-NMSC-035, 89 N.M. 453, 553 P.2d 1260.\n\nGun as deadly weapon.— There was no room for argument that gun with which defendant was armed when he committed assault and robbery was not a dangerous weapon, whether loaded or unloaded.State v. Montano, 1961-NMSC-174, 69 N.M. 332, 367 P.2d 95.\n\nBB gun as a deadly weapon.— Although a BB gun is not a deadly weapon as a matter of law, where the state was prepared to show that defendant pointed what looked to the victim to be a handgun at the victim's stomach area and demanded money, a jury could reasonably conclude that the gun and the manner of use indicated that it was a weapon that could inflict a dangerous wound.State v. Fernandez, 2007-NMCA-091, 142 N.M. 231, 164 P.3d 112.\n\nOwnership.— The crime of robbery requires that the property taken be in the immediate control of another; however, the property need not be owned by the person from whom it was taken.State v. Kenny, 1991-NMCA-094, 112 N.M. 642, 818 P.2d 420, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 499, 816 P.2d 1121.\n\nIV. INDICTMENT AND INFORMATION.\n\nReference to statute sufficient.— Indictment charging defendant with \"robbery while armed with a deadly weapon contrary to 40A-16-2, 1953 Comp. [Section 30-16-2 NMSA 1978]\" was not deficient for failure to include phrase \"by use or threatened use of violence\" since such phrase was contained in the definition of, and was included in the word, robbery, and since an indictment was sufficient if it identified the crime charged by reference to the statute establishing the offense.State v. Walsh, 1969-NMCA-123, 81 N.M. 65, 463 P.2d 41.\n\nAlternative charges.— Charge of both robbery and armed robbery in indictment was not duplicitous because all that was charged was that the one robbery was committed in two ways, namely, robbery without specification of the means and robbery by firearm, and such was not duplicity, but alternative pleading.State v. Roque, 1977-NMCA-094, 91 N.M. 7, 569 P.2d 417, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 4, 569 P.2d 414.\n\nBill of particulars.— Defendant's motion for bill of particulars should have been granted, furnishing name and type of store where the robbery allegedly occurred, whether a safe, vault or other depository was involved and the name of the person or persons allegedly intimidated or threatened, and failure to grant motion was reversible error.State v. Graves, 1963-NMSC-183, 73 N.M. 79, 385 P.2d 635 (decided under prior law).\n\nV. EVIDENCE.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nAdmission of unavailable accomplice's tape recorded custodial police interviewwas not harmless error because it provided key evidence directly inculpating defendant convicted of felony murder, and remaining circumstantial evidence against him, although strong, was disputed.State v. Johnson, 2004-NMSC-029, 136 N.M. 348, 98 P.3d 998, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1177, 125 S. Ct. 1334, 161 L. Ed. 2d 162 (2005).\n\nStatement by defendant.— Testimony that defendant said, \"I was going to do something but I was too scared,\" while hearsay, was admitted without objection and, therefore, was competent in robbery prosecution.State v. Baca, 1971-NMCA-142, 83 N.M. 184, 489 P.2d 1182.\n\nDefendant's pecuniary condition.— In prosecution for robbery while armed with dangerous weapon under Laws 1921, ch. 20, § 1 evidence of accused's pecuniary condition, on the question of motive, was properly excluded.State v. Tapia, 1937-NMSC-077, 41 N.M. 616, 72 P.2d 1087.\n\nOther crime.— In prosecution for aggravated burglary, armed robbery and rape it was proper to go into details of another rape some five blocks away about an hour later, in order to establish both characteristic conduct and possession of knife and flashlight involved in first crime.State v. Lopez, 1969-NMCA-057, 80 N.M. 599, 458 P.2d 851, cert. denied, 80 N.M. 607, 458 P.2d 859, and cert. denied, 398 U.S. 942, 90 S. Ct. 1860, 26 L. Ed. 2d 279 (1970).\n\nOther offenses.— In armed robbery prosecution, reference in defendant's statement to two other offenses committed in a continuous sequence immediately preceding robbery, in light of alibi defense and identity issue was properly not deleted.State v. Stout, 1971-NMCA-028, 82 N.M. 455, 483 P.2d 510.\n\nPolygraph test results.— Where armed robbery was committed in daylight in victim's home and took about 20 minutes, throughout which time victim was in presence of the perpetrator, and victim identified defendant as that person, admission into evidence of polygraph test results as per stipulation of the defense, without objection at trial, was not a denial of a fair trial or due process.State v. Chavez, 1969-NMCA-109, 80 N.M. 786, 461 P.2d 919 (decided under prior law).\n\nExhibits admissible.— There was no abuse of discretion on part of trial judge in admitting into evidence moneybags and contents stolen by robbers, along with jacket the same color as one worn by one robber and pistol which would match general description of robbery weapon, which items were found in car driven by defendant which he and companion abandoned, and checks stolen at same time, which were on person of companion.State v. Beachum, 1970-NMCA-119, 82 N.M. 204, 477 P.2d 1019.\n\nWeight of evidence.— Defense argument that items of stolen property were not shown to have been in possession of defendants went to the weight to be accorded this evidence and not its admissibility, where evidence indicated that defendants had possession of the property in cafe and attempted to destroy or conceal it.State v. Santillanes, 1970-NMCA-003, 81 N.M. 185, 464 P.2d 915.\n\nAbsence of alibi witness.— Where defendant in trial for armed robbery proceeded to trial without objection, knowing that alibi witness was not present, without applying for writ of attachment or other process to secure her presence, and during hearing upon motion for new trial, trial court heard witness' testimony and concluded it was not probable that a different result would have been reached had her testimony been produced at trial, it could not be said that court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial.State v. Milton, 1969-NMCA-099, 80 N.M. 727, 460 P.2d 257.\n\nB. SUFFICIENCY.\n\nCircumstantial evidence.— Circumstantial evidence may suffice to establish the corpus delicti, and it may also suffice as proof of the identity of the perpetrator of a crime.State v. Santillanes, 1970-NMCA-003, 81 N.M. 185, 464 P.2d 915.\n\nCorpus delicti plus identity of robber.— Proof sufficient to sustain a conviction of the crime of robbery involves proof of two distinct propositions, namely, the theft of something of value from the person of another or from the immediate control of another by use or threatened use of force or violence, and that such theft was done by the person or persons charged; in other words, proof of the corpus delicti and the identity of the accused.State v. Santillanes, 1970-NMCA-003, 81 N.M. 185, 464 P.2d 915.\n\nCorpus delicti proven.— Corpus delicti in prosecution for armed robbery was sufficiently proven by testimony of complaining witness that he was the victim of a robbery by some person armed with a dangerous weapon.State v. Nance, 1966-NMSC-207, 77 N.M. 39, 419 P.2d 242, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1039, 87 S. Ct. 1495, 18 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1967).\n\nThreatened use of force.Where a defendant points a note at the teller's cash drawer, keeps his other hand hidden from view, states that the teller should give him everything, and directs the teller not to use the alarm, a reasonable fact finder could conclude that this combination of actions threatened force and caused the teller to hand over the contents of the cash drawerState v. Hernandez, 2003-NMCA-131, 134 N.M. 510, 79 P.3d 1118, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-002, 134 N.M. 723, 82 P.3d 533.\n\nIdentification adequate.— Where victim and witness of robbery perpetrated by two masked men described, on the night of the robbery, the robber and the clothes he was wearing, and at trial identified clothes found in defendant's apartment and defendant himself on basis of his posture, size and stoop, there was sufficient evidence to establish that defendant was one of the men involved in the robbery.State v. Quintana, 1961-NMSC-108, 69 N.M. 51, 364 P.2d 120;see alsoState v. Montano, 1961-NMSC-174, 69 N.M. 332, 367 P.2d 95.\n\nVictim identification.— Where the victim positively identified the defendant, this testimony, alone, was held sufficient to sustain the conviction.State v. Hunt, 1972-NMCA-026, 83 N.M. 546, 494 P.2d 624.\n\nExact role of defendant immaterial.— Although evidence as to which of the robbers took the change was sparse and conflicting, this did not matter. The jury was instructed on aiding and abetting and the evidence was substantial that defendant was at least an aider and abettor of the robbery of the change.State v. Urban, 1974-NMCA-046, 86 N.M. 351, 524 P.2d 523.\n\nMere presence insufficient.— If proof disclosed only presence of defendant at scene of robbery it would not support a conviction.State v. Santillanes, 1970-NMCA-003, 81 N.M. 185, 464 P.2d 915.\n\nWhere state did not contend that defendant and his companions entered service station with any thought or intention of committing a crime, and acts relating to alleged robbery commenced after defendant had been shot and placed in his car, defendant could only have committed robbery as accessory or as aider and abettor and only if the record showed that defendant shared the criminal intent and purpose of the principals, mere presence without some outward manifestation of approval being insufficient.State v. Salazar, 1967-NMSC-187, 78 N.M. 329, 431 P.2d 62.\n\nDefendant's participation not shown.— Evidence was insufficient to support verdict against individual who remained in back seat of car while two companions got out and beat and robbed person who had been given a ride, where there was no showing of a community of purpose to accomplish the crime, or any acts, words, signs or motions that would evince a design to encourage, incite or approve of the crime.State v. Lucero, 1957-NMSC-062, 63 N.M. 80, 313 P.2d 1052.\n\nDriver of getaway car.— Testimony that complaining witness was beaten and robbed by two individuals with whom he had been riding, while driver of the car kept the motor running, saw what occurred and drove the getaway car was sufficient to find driver guilty as a principal.State v. Lucero, 1957-NMSC-062, 63 N.M. 80, 313 P.2d 1052.\n\nMere presence insufficient.— Verdict of attempted armed robbery was supported by substantial evidence where defendant was driver of car stationed outside liquor store and lounge awaiting commission of armed robbery by others, one of whom had pulled gun on manager and told him to lie down behind counter when robbery was abandoned after witness walked into store and started screaming.State v. Paul, 1972-NMCA-043, 83 N.M. 619, 495 P.2d 797.\n\nFiring at police.— Shooting by defendant at police who were pursuing car in which he and robber were passengers which was fleeing scene of crime was evidence that defendant approved the robbery and shared the robber's criminal intent, and was sufficient to sustain armed robbery conviction.State v. O'Dell, 1973-NMCA-124, 85 N.M. 536, 514 P.2d 55.\n\nExclusive possession of stolen property.— Articles stolen from store by robbers which were found a short time later in front seat of car driven by defendant constituted evidence which would support conclusion that defendant was in exclusive possession of the property, despite fact that another person accompanied defendant in the car.State v. Beachum, 1970-NMCA-119, 82 N.M. 204, 477 P.2d 1019.\n\nPossession insufficient absent other facts.— Although recently stolen property found in exclusive possession of defendant will not alone support a verdict of guilt, circumstances of flight, apprehension only minutes after robbery a short distance from scene of crime, and finding of clothing in car driven by defendant fitting description of eye witnesses, constituted sufficient circumstance of guilt in addition to possession of property stolen to support verdict.State v. Beachum, 1970-NMCA-119, 82 N.M. 204, 477 P.2d 1019.\n\nSeizure of weapon during commission of robbery.— When defendant acquires a weapon during the commission of a robbery and then uses the weapon to harm or threaten the victim, or to acquire additional possessions from the victim, he is guilty of armed robbery.State v. Hamilton, 2000-NMCA-063, 129 N.M. 321, 6 P.3d 1043, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 249, 4 P.3d 1240.\n\nThe determination of whether a defendant who seizes a weapon during the commission of a robbery is armed \"while\" committing the robbery is highly fact sensitive. When the defendant acquires the weapon and how he uses it after its acquisition are paramount.State v. Hamilton, 2000-NMCA-063, 129 N.M. 321, 6 P.3d 1043, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 249, 4 P.3d 1240.\n\nCodefendant's use of weapon.— Where several defendants were prosecuted for robbery, all tried as principals, proof that one was armed with dangerous weapon was sufficient to satisfy allegation of the information that all were so armed, and allegation that dangerous weapon was held in hands of one defendant was surplusage.State v. Kimbell, 1930-NMSC-075, 35 N.M. 101, 290 P. 792.\n\nDeadly character of weapon not established.— In prosecution for robbery while armed with a deadly weapon, where defendant was convicted as an accessory, evidence that other man raised a tire tool, the size, length or weight of which was not described, over service station attendant's head \"like a threat,\" without more, was insufficient for a determination that tire tool was capable of producing death or great bodily harm or a weapon with which dangerous wounds could be inflicted.State v. Gonzales, 1973-NMCA-153, 85 N.M. 780, 517 P.2d 1306.\n\nSurprise not equivalent to force.— The defendant's motion for a directed verdict, questioning the sufficiency of the evidence for a conviction of armed robbery, should have been sustained, where witness only testified that he had been taken by surprise and not that by force or fear he had been induced to part with anything of value.State v. Baca, 1971-NMCA-142, 83 N.M. 184, 489 P.2d 1182.\n\nJostling victim.— Evidence of jostling or causing the victim to fall as property is taken is a sufficient showing to establish the use of force.State v. Martinez, 1973-NMCA-120, 85 N.M. 468, 513 P.2d 402.\n\nEvidence sufficient.— Where the victim identified defendant in court and testified that defendant was in a white car that drove up alongside the victim, that defendant grabbed the victim's purse, and that the purse and its contents had value and a police officer testified that the victim's driver's license, which was in the purse, was found during an inventory search of a vehicle in which defendant was a passenger, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for robbery.State v. Verdugo, 2007-NMCA-095, 142 N.M. 267, 164 P.3d 966, cert. quashed, 2008-NMCERT-011, 145 N.M. 531, 202 P.3d 124.\n\nWhere defendant approached an employee of a hotel in the hotel laundry room, struck the employee in the face with a closed fist, beat the employee over the head with a hard plastic tube, took the keys to the hotel office, and took money from the hotel cash drawer, there was sufficient evidence that defendant formed the intent to commit robbery before or during the time defendant committed the battery on the employee.State v. Lopez, 2011-NMCA-071, 150 N.M. 34, 256 P.3d 977, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.\n\nCircumstantial evidence, sufficient to sustain the defendant's conviction for robbery, included evidence placing defendant and his distinctly colored car at the service station on the afternoon before the robbery, evidence that the robber departed the scene in this car after the robbery, the description of the robber given by a witness and defendant's own statement against his interest.State v. Milton, 1974-NMCA-094, 86 N.M. 639, 526 P.2d 436.\n\nWhere defendant had told witnesses before and after the murder that he was going to rob/had robbed someone and no money was found on murdered victim but there was evidence that victim had money, there was sufficient evidence introduced for jury to find that defendant committed armed robbery.State v. Montoya, 1984-NMSC-073, 101 N.M. 424, 684 P.2d 510.\n\nEvidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction as an accessory to armed robbery, where his confession, found to be voluntary, was corroborated by other evidence at trial.Church v. Sullivan, 942 F.2d 1501 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\nEvidence that defendants intruded into husband and wife's home, beat and kicked the husband, and dragged both of them into a closet prior to absconding with money and jewelry, sufficed for a conviction for robbery.State v. Ibarra, 1993-NMCA-040, 116 N.M. 486, 864 P.2d 302, cert. quashed, 117 N.M. 744, 877 P.2d 44 (1994), and cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1157, 115 S. Ct. 1116, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1080 (1995).\n\nWhere there was evidence that defendant or accomplice or both assaulted victim and split the money taken from the victim, this is sufficient evidence for the conviction of robbery, as principal or as an accessory.State v. Lopez, 2005-NMSC-036, 138 N.M. 521, 123 P.3d 754,overruled on other grounds byState v. Rudy B., 2010-NMSC-045, 149 N.M. 22, 243 P.3d 726.\n\nCredibility and weight of evidence for jury.— Where although the evidence concerning armed robbery was conflicting it substantially supported the verdict, the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony was for the jury to determine.State v. Valles, 1972-NMCA-027, 83 N.M. 541, 494 P.2d 619.\n\nJury to determine facts.— Whether defendant had gun in her hand as testified to by robbery victim was for the jury to resolve.State v. Encee, 1968-NMCA-012, 79 N.M. 23, 439 P.2d 240.\n\nVI. INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nScope of appellate review regarding jury charge.— Comparing the elements of aggravated assault, a compound offense that has three alternate ways of being charged, with armed robbery, another offense for which the statute contains alternatives, the appellate court looks only to the statutes as charged to the jury and disregards the inapplicable statutory elements.State v. Armijo, 2005-NMCA-010, 136 N.M. 723, 104 P.3d 1114.\n\nInstructions substantially following language of statute was sufficient.State v. Lopez, 1969-NMCA-057, 80 N.M. 599, 458 P.2d 851, cert. denied, 80 N.M. 607, 458 P.2d 859, and cert. denied, 398 U.S. 942, 90 S. Ct. 1860, 26 L. Ed. 2d 279 (1970).\n\nMore clarity possible.— Court of appeals held that while an instruction in robbery prosecution on the requisite intent to steal would have been a clearer statement as to that element, an instruction in the language of the statute was legally sufficient.State v. Puga, 1973-NMCA-079, 85 N.M. 204, 510 P.2d 1075.\n\nUse or threat of violence.— Since \"use or threatened use of force or violence\" is an essential element of this crime, a failure to instruct on this essential element is reversible error.State v. Walsh, 1969-NMCA-123, 81 N.M. 65, 463 P.2d 41.\n\nPutting victim in fear.— Instruction requiring acquittal if jury believed that defendant did not with force and violence take the property would have been erroneous since jury might have been satisfied that there was an \"assault and putting in fear,\" which with other essential ingredients of the offense was all that was requisite for a conviction.Territory v. Abeita, 1873-NMSC-001, 1 N.M. 545 (decided under prior law).\n\nIntent adequately covered.— Defendant's argument that since he was charged with being accessory to an attempted armed robbery and where there was no evidence of a demand for money or goods, he was entitled to a specific intent instruction within the general intent instruction was without merit where a separate instruction on attempt was given as well as an instruction on armed robbery setting out requirement of specific intent.State v. Paul, 1972-NMCA-043, 83 N.M. 619, 495 P.2d 797.\n\nTrain hold-up.— The phrase \"holding up,\" when used in instructions in relation to an attack upon a train, meant the forcible detention of a train with intent to commit a robbery or some other felony.Territory v. McGinnis, 1900-NMSC-019, 10 N.M. 269, 61 P. 208,overruled on other grounds byState v. Deltenre, 1966-NMSC-187, 77 N.M. 497, 424 P.2d 782 (decided under prior law).\n\nFruits of crime.— Since a determination by jury that defendant had in his possession the fruits of the crime does not justify a finding of guilt unless there is evidence of other circumstances connecting the defendant with the offense, the jury should also be instructed as to the requirement of proof by the state of other circumstances by which the defendant is linked to the crime charged.State v. Graves, 1963-NMSC-183, 73 N.M. 79, 385 P.2d 635.\n\nPossession of unidentified money.— The court in its instructions in robbery case, must explain to the jury the rules of law with respect to possession of unidentified money, so that the jury will have a guide in making its determination of what weight, if any, is to be given to this type of evidence; the jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had in his possession the actual fruits of the crime, or a part thereof.State v. Graves, 1963-NMSC-183, 73 N.M. 79, 385 P.2d 635.\n\nEntrapment.— Where there was no evidence that informer who drove getaway car either persuaded or induced defendant to commit armed robbery, defendant was not entitled to instruction on entrapment.State v. Sweat, 1972-NMCA-092, 84 N.M. 122, 500 P.2d 207.\n\nInstruction on larceny required.— Because robbery is an aggravated larceny, larceny is necessarily included within the offense of robbery, so that defendant had the right to have instructions on the lesser included offenses of larceny submitted to the jury, since there was evidence from several defense witnesses which tended to establish larceny.State v. Wingate, 1975-NMCA-035, 87 N.M. 397, 534 P.2d 776.\n\nAn instruction on larceny should have been given since there was evidence that the defendant's shoving of the victim was part of his drunkenness, and that the purse was taken without force sufficient to constitute robbery.State v. Curley, 1997-NMCA-038, 123 N.M. 295, 939 P.2d 1103.\n\nCharge on lesser offense not supported.— Where testimony of victim did not give rise to any other conclusion than that defendant committed the robbery while armed, defendant was not entitled to have the jury instructed on the lesser offenses because there was no evidence to establish them.State v. Sweat, 84 N.M. 122, 500 P.2d 207.\n\nDirecting verdict.— In a prosecution for unarmed robbery, a motion for a directed verdict is to be determined by viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state.State v. Sanchez, 1967-NMCA-009, 78 N.M. 284, 430 P.2d 781.\n\nSelf-defense instruction refused since defendant entered store with weapon, prepared to rob.— Where a murder defendant entered a store with a weapon, prepared to commit armed robbery if the circumstances permitted it, such facts can only reasonably point to the commission of a felony in a situation which is, of itself, \"inherently or foreseeably dangerous to human life,\" and a self-defense instruction is properly refused.State v. Chavez, 1983-NMSC-037, 99 N.M. 609, 661 P.2d 887.\n\nVoluntary intoxication.Where the defendant presented no evidence that he was intoxicated to any degree, let alone to the point that it affected his ability to form the necessary mental state for robbery, a specific-intent crime, he was not entitled to an instruction on voluntary intoxication; mere evidence that the defendant consumed an intoxicant is not enough to warrant an intoxication instruction.State v. Hernandez, 2003-NMCA-131, 134 N.M. 510, 79 P.3d 1118, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-002, 134 N.M. 723, 82 P.3d 533.\n\nVII. SUBSEQUENT ARMED ROBBERY OFFENSES.\n\nSubsequent armed robbery offenses.— Proof of prior armed robbery convictions should be presented to the judge and established by a preponderance of the evidence.State v. Villegas, 2009-NMCA-023, 145 N.M. 592, 203 P.3d 123, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-001, 145 N.M. 655, 203 P.3d 870.\n\nPrior armed robbery not also used with habitual offender statute.— A prior armed robbery conviction may not be used for ehancement under both this section and the habitual offender provision; accordingly, in the case of a defendant who has one prior burglary, one prior armed robbery, and one current armed robbery, the sentence for the current offense, discounting any reduction for mitigating circumstances, should be that for a second armed robbery plus a one-year enhancement for the prior burglary under the habitual offender statute.State v. Keith, 1985-NMCA-012, 102 N.M. 462, 697 P.2d 145, cert. denied, 102 N.M. 492, 697 P.2d 492.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Confusing Law of Criminal Intent in New Mexico,\" see 5 N.M.L.

Office of the Public Defender, 2012-NMSC-029, 285 P.3d 622.\n\nRule of lenity.— When deciding whether or not a burglary charge is appropriate, courts and district attorneys must consider whether or not this is the type of entry Section 30-16-3 NMSA 1978 was intended to deter. Any doubts about the construction of Section 30-16-3 NMSA 1978 must be resolved in favor of lenity.State v. Office of the Public Defender, 2012-NMSC-029, 285 P.3d 622.\n\nNew rule, narrowing the scope of what conduct is prosecuted under the burglary statute, should be applied retroactively.— Where defendant was charged and convicted of felony burglary in 2010, and where, in 2015, defendant was again charged and convicted of numerous offenses, and where the state sought to enhance defendant's 2015 sentence pursuant to the Habitual Offender Act, § 31-18-17 NMSA 1978, relying on defendant's 2010 felony conviction, and where defendant claimed that his 2010 burglary conviction should not be used to enhance his 2015 sentence, based on the New Mexico supreme court's decision inState v. Office of Public Defender ex rel. Muqqddin, 2012-NMSC-029, which held for the first time that the act of penetrating a vehicle's gas tank and removing gas therefrom did not constitute burglary under § 30-16-3 NMSA 1978, the district court erred in determining defendant to be a habitual offender as alleged by the state and enhancing defendant's sentence in the 2015 case, because Muqqddin announced a new rule that altered the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes, and should therefore be applied retroactively.State v. Wood, 2022-NMCA-009.\n\nPurpose to protect possessory rights.— The statutory offense of burglary is one against the security of property, and its purpose is to protect possessory rights.State v. Sanchez, 1987-NMCA-035, 105 N.M. 619, 735 P.2d 536, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 618, 735 P.2d 536.\n\nLegislative consolidation intended.— A comparison of this section and the statutes concerning burglary and unlawful entry that existed prior to 1963 (40-9-1, 40-9-6, 40-9-7, 40-9-10, 1953 Comp.) indicates that the new section is a consolidation of the old statutes and does not evidence an intention of the legislature to exclude from the crime of burglary unauthorized entries to structures other than dwellings. It is clear that he legislature intended the term \"other structure\" to be construed in its literal sense and that it not be limited by the specific language preceding it. It is proper for the court to consider prior and subsequent statutes in pari materia to determine legislative intent.State v. Gonzales, 1967-NMSC-168, 78 N.M. 218, 430 P.2d 376.\n\nCommon law expanded.— Section 40-9-6, 1953 Comp., defines the offense of burglary so as to expand the common-law definition of that offense to include the breaking and entering of offices, shops and warehouses.Martinez v. United States, 295 F.2d 426 (10th Cir. 1961) (decided under prior law).\n\nCrime of violence.— The offense defined under this section of breaking and entering a dwelling house or other building with intent to commit a felony therein was a crime of violence for purposes of former 15 U.S.C. § 902(e) relating to the transporting of a firearm in interstate commerce after conviction of a crime of violence.Martinez v. United States, 295 F.2d 426 (10th Cir. 1961) (decided under prior law).\n\nThe district court properly included defendant's state burglary conviction as a violent felony under 18 U.S.C. § 924, the Armed Career Criminal Act.United States v. Lujan, 9 F.3d 890 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nProsecution of Indians limited.— Where a federal statute limiting the definition and punishment of burglary by an Indian within Indian country to the laws of the several states in force at the time of its enactment, and there was no law of New Mexico in effect at that time defining a crime of burglary as it was charged in the information, defendant's motion to dismiss the information was sustained.United States v. Gomez, 250 F. Supp. 535 (D.N.M. 1966).\n\nII. MULTIPLE PROSECUTIONS.\n\nSeveral burglaries.— The burglary of several businesses in one building at approximately the same time constitutes not one offense, but several, and a defendant may be prosecuted for all such offenses.State v. Ortega, 1974-NMCA-060, 86 N.M. 350, 524 P.2d 522.\n\nWhen one commits burglary of dwelling house one commits criminal trespassbased on that entry.State v. Ruiz, 1980-NMCA-123, 94 N.M. 771, 617 P.2d 160, superseded by statute,State v. McCormack, 1984-NMCA-042, 101 N.M. 349, 682 P.2d 742.\n\nTwo crimes shown.— Evidence that a conspiracy to commit burglary was entered on the evening of November 16th, that the conspirators unsuccessfully attempted to carry out the conspiracy at 10:30 p.m. of that day, and that the burglary was performed between 9:00 and 9:30 a.m. of November 17th, showed two distinct crimes, and there was no factual basis for the contention that they were either the same or so similar that multiple convictions were prohibited.State v. Watkins, 1975-NMCA-126, 88 N.M. 561, 543 P.2d 1189, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71.\n\nLarceny not lesser included offense.— Larceny is not a lesser included offense of burglary, since each crime includes an element not contained in the other. Burglary requires entry into a dwelling, whereas larceny does not, and larceny requires an actual taking, whereas burglary does not.Yparrea v. Dorsey, 64 F.3d 577 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\nLarceny and burglary not merged.— Prosecution for burglary and larceny arising out of the same event does not constitute double jeopardy since there is no merger when an accused is charged with both burglary and larceny though the charges stem from one transaction or event.State v. Deats, 1971-NMCA-089, 82 N.M. 711, 487 P.2d 139.\n\nSince stealing is a necessary element of larceny but is not a necessary element of burglary, larceny is not necessarily involved in a burglary, and the two crimes do not merge, hence, defendant could be convicted of and sentenced for both crimes.State v. McAfee, 1967-NMSC-139, 78 N.M. 108, 428 P.2d 647.\n\nPossession of burglary toolsis not necessarily involved in burglary.State v. Everitt, 1969-NMCA-010, 80 N.M. 41, 450 P.2d 927.\n\nBurglary and possession of burglary tools does not merge.— The crime of possession of burglary tools does not merge with the crime of burglary, and hence defendant's sentence for each of these crimes did not constitute double punishment.State v. Everitt, 1969-NMCA-010, 80 N.M. 41, 450 P.2d 927.\n\nAs the \"overt act\" required in the general attempt statute 30-28-1 NMSA 1978 did not necessarily involve possession of burglary tools, the crime of attempt to commit a felony of burglary did not merge with the crime of possession of burglary tools, and hence, defendant's sentence for each of these crimes did not constitute double punishment.State v. Everitt, 1969-NMCA-010, 80 N.M. 41, 450 P.2d 927.\n\nConvictions for burglary and receiving improper.— The state cannot convict a person under one indictment or information of receiving stolen property, and then subsequently convict him under another indictment or information of burglary, if the burglary conviction is dependent upon a theft by him of the same property, and he is shown to have been the person who actually took and asported the property during the burglarious entry.State v. Gleason, 1969-NMCA-054, 80 N.M. 382, 456 P.2d 215.\n\n\"Disposal\" shown.— Where the record supported the conclusion that the defendant \"disposed of \" property which he may have also stolen, as the theft and disposal were different acts, the principle that one who is a thief cannot be convicted of \"receiving\" the property he stole because the theft and receipt are the same act was inapplicable.State v. Mitchell, 1974-NMCA-057, 86 N.M. 343, 524 P.2d 206.\n\nEntry of a vehicle.— The use of a nail to penetrate a vehicle's gas tank constitutes an entry under Section 30-16-3 NMSA 1978.State v. Muqqddin, 2010-NMCA-069, 148 N.M. 845, 242 P.3d 412, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-008, 148 N.M. 942, 242 P.3d 1288.\n\nWhere, without the permission of the owner of a van to enter the van, defendant used a nail to penetrate the gas tank to drain gas from the tank, defendant was guilty of burglary.State v. Muqqddin, 2010-NMCA-069, 148 N.M. 845, 242 P.3d 412, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-008, 148 N.M. 943, 242 P.3d 1289.\n\nEntry into a retail store.— As a general rule, the court will presume that retail stores are open to the public during business hours and, therefore, an individual who enters a retail store with the intent to shoplift is not guilty of burglary.State v. Baca, 2014-NMCA-087, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-008.\n\nWhere a group of people, including defendant, entered Costco; no person in the group was a member of Costco, but one person showed the Costco greeter a membership card that belonged to another person; one person in the group placed items in a bag that other persons in the group pointed out; at the checkout line, the group purchased only water and ice cream; Costco was a membership warehouse; one had to be a member or a guest of a member to enter the store; and \"member only\" signs were posted outside Costco as notice to the public that only members could enter, defendant's entry into Costco, even assuming that defendant was aware that the person presenting the membership card was a non-member, was not sufficient as a matter of law to establish an unauthorized entry and the crime of burglary.State v. Baca, 2014-NMCA-087, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-008.\n\nIII. ELEMENTS OF OFFENSE.\n\nEntry into separate residence of spouse.— Section 40-3-3 NMSA 1978 does not provide immunity from prosecution for burglary of a spouse's separate residence.State v. Parvilus, 2014-NMSC-028,rev'g2013-NMCA-025, 297 P.3d 1228.\n\nWhere, because of domestic problems, defendant rented a separate apartment for defendant's spouse; the parties agreed that the apartment was the spouse's separate residence, that defendant would not have a key to the apartment, and that defendant did not have the spouse's permission to enter the apartment; and several months later, defendant entered the spouse's apartment through a window, 40-3-3 NMSA 1978 did not preclude defendant's conviction for burglary of the spouse's separate dwelling.State v. Parvilus, 2014-NMSC-028,rev'g2013-NMCA-025, 297 P.3d 1228.\n\nThe plain language of Section 40-3-3 NMSA 1978renders inter-spousal burglary an impossibility, because the New Mexico burglary statutes protect the possessory right to exclude and Section 40-3-3 NMSA 1978 dictates that spouses have no such right to exclude the other spouse.State v. Parvilus, 2013-NMCA-025, 297 P.3d 1228, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-001.\n\nEntry into residence of estranged spouse.— Where defendant entered defendant's estranged spouse's apartment without permission, kidnapped the victim, and killed the victim, Section 40-3-3 NMSA 1978 prohibited defendant's spouse from excluding defendant from the spouse's apartment and defendant's entry into the apartment, even with felonious purpose, did not constitute burglary as a matter of law.State v. Parvilus, 2013-NMCA-025, 297 P.3d 1228, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-001.\n\nParts of protected spaces.— An entry into a part of the enumerated structures in Section 30-16-3 NMSA 1978 is not equal to an entry of that structure itself.State v. Office of the Public Defender, 2012-NMSC-029, 285 P.3d 622.\n\nProtected spaces must be enclosed.— The right to exclude others is the possessory interest with which burglary is primarily concerned. For an area to be considered prohibited space under Section 30-16-3 NMSA 1978, it must have some sort of enclosure.State v. Office of the Public Defender, 2012-NMSC-029, 285 P.3d 622.\n\nA vehicle's gas tank and wheel wells are not protected spaces.— A vehicle's gas tank and wheel wells do not constitute a protected space under Section 30-16-3 NMSA 1978 and cannot be burglarized under the statute.State v. Office of the Public Defender, 2012-NMSC-029, 285 P.3d 622.\n\nA vehicle's gas tank is not a protected space.— Where defendant used a piece of metal to puncture a gas tank and took the gas, the defendants did not commit burglary.State v. Office of the Public Defender, 2012-NMSC-029, 285 P.3d 622,rev'g2010-NMCA-069, 148 N.M. 845, 242 P.3d 412.\n\nThe use of a nail to penetrate a vehicle's gas tank constitutes an entry under Section 30-16-3 NMSA 1978.State v. Muqqddin, 2010-NMCA-069, 148 N.M. 845, 242 P.3d 412, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-008, 148 N.M. 942, 242 P.3d 1288.\n\nEntry of a vehicle.— Where, without the permission of the owner of a van to enter the van, defendant used a nail to penetrate the gas tank to drain gas from the tank, defendant was guilty of burglary.State v. Muqqddin, 2010-NMCA-069, 148 N.M. 845, 242 P.3d 412, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-008, 148 N.M. 942, 242 P.3d 1288.\n\nA vehicle's wheel wells are not a protected space.— Where defendant removed the two rear wheels of a vehicle and the lug nuts of the front wheels, the defendants did not commit burglary.State v. Office of the Public Defender, 2012-NMSC-029, 285 P.3d 622.\n\nStructure.— Where the defendant took items from a covered area that was open on three sides but directly attached to the wall of a store; the area was covered by a metal roof that was supported by metal posts; the area was used to store merchandise and equipment; a door from the main building led from the store to the covered area; and a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire abutted the open yard that surrounded the covered area, the covered area constituted a structure.State v. Gonzales, 2008-NMCA-146, 145 N.M. 110, 194 P.3d 725, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-009, 145 N.M. 257, 196 P.3d 488.\n\nBurglary is offense against security of building,and when that security is breached by the penetration of an instrument into the building there has been an entry within the meaning of this statute.State v. Tixier, 1976-NMCA-054, 89 N.M. 297, 551 P.2d 987.\n\nEntry.— Although New Mexico no longer defines burglary in terms of a \"breaking,\" the offense of burglary remains an offense against the security of the property which is entered.State v. Ortiz, 1978-NMCA-074, 92 N.M. 166, 584 P.2d 1306, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 79, 582 P.2d 1292.\n\nIn establishing a burglary, any penetration, however slight, of the interior space is sufficient to constitute entry.State v. Reynolds, 1990-NMCA-122, 111 N.M. 263, 804 P.2d 1082, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 164, 803 P.2d 253 (1991).\n\nUnlawful entry of building in nighttime constitutes \"burglary,\"the punishment being dependent upon the degree of the offense.Miller v. Cox, 1960-NMSC-108, 67 N.M. 414, 356 P.2d 231 (decided under prior law).\n\nBreaking not required.— The requirement of a \"breaking\" is no longer included in New Mexico's statutory definition of burglary, which is not concerned with distinctions between evidence of breaking as opposed to evidence of entering.State v. Tixier, 1976-NMCA-054, 89 N.M. 297, 551 P.2d 987.\n\nEntry plus intent.— The crime of burglary is complete when the defendant makes an unauthorized entry with intent to commit any felony or theft.State v. Madrid, 1972-NMSC-016, 83 N.M. 603, 495 P.2d 383;State v. Gutierrez, 1971-NMCA-058, 82 N.M. 578, 484 P.2d 1288, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 562, 484 P.2d 1272.\n\nThe crime of burglary is complete when there is an unauthorized entry with the intent to commit a felony or theft in the vehicle or structure entered.State v. Wilkerson, 1972-NMCA-067, 83 N.M. 770, 497 P.2d 981;State v. Everitt, 1969-NMCA-010, 80 N.M. 41, 450 P.2d 927;State v. Ford, 1970-NMCA-061, 81 N.M. 556, 469 P.2d 535.\n\nIn order to prove the crime of burglary, it is required to prove unlawful entry of a structure with the necessary intent.State v. Hinojos, 1967-NMCA-003, 78 N.M. 32, 427 P.2d 683.\n\nThe mere entry of an occupied dwelling house in the nighttime with intent to commit larceny is burglary.State v. Ocanas, 1956-NMSC-106, 61 N.M. 484, 303 P.2d 390.\n\nUnauthorized entry required.— A person is guilty of burglary if he enters a building or occupied structure, or separately secured or occupied portion thereof, with purpose to commit a crime therein, unless the premises are at the time, open to the public or the actor is licensed or privileged to enter.State v. Sanchez, 1987-NMCA-035, 105 N.M. 619, 735 P.2d 536, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 618, 735 P.2d 536.\n\nEntry into locked office adjacent to public motel lobby constituted unauthorized entry.— Where defendant's accomplice entered a secured clerk's office, separate from the public motel lobby, by climbing over a chest-high counter top, broke the lock on a cash drawer and removed $250, the accomplice's conduct constituted an unauthorized entry under the burglary statute, because the clerk's office was designed to remain separate from the public lobby area, and the enclosure's physical characteristics were such that a reasonable person would expect some protection from unauthorized intrusions.State v. Mestas, 2016-NMCA-047.\n\nBurden on state to prove unauthorized entry.— It is not necessary that every person who could consent to entry testifies that consent was given as the burden on the state is to prove unauthorized entry beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Mireles, 1971-NMCA-027, 82 N.M. 453, 483 P.2d 508.\n\nTypes of unauthorized entry.— A trespassory entry would be an unauthorized entry, as would an entry without consent or on the basis of an unauthorized consent.State v. Ortiz, 1978-NMCA-074, 92 N.M. 166, 584 P.2d 1306, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 79, 582 P.2d 1292.\n\nUnauthorized entry.— Entry by fraud, deceit or pretense, whether characterized as trespassory, without consent or without authorized consent, is an unauthorized entry, similar to the constructive \"breaking\" at common law.State v. Ortiz, 1978-NMCA-074, 92 N.M. 166, 584 P.2d 1306, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 79, 582 P.2d 1292.\n\nBurglary statute intended to punish harmful entry.— The burglary statute has a greater purpose than merely protecting property, but it is also the invasion of privacy and the victim's feeling of being personally violated that is the harm caused by the modern burglar and the evil that our society is attempting to deter through the burglary statute; first and foremost, it is the harmful entry that is being punished under this section. State v. Archuleta, 2015-NMCA-037,overrulingState v. Tower, 2002-NMCA-109, 133 N.M. 32, 59 P.3d 1264, and cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere defendant violated an order of no trespass by entering an otherwise open public shopping area with the intent to commit a theft, his conduct did not implicate the feeling of violation and vulnerability generally associated with the crime of burglary and did not constitute the type of harmful entry required for a violation of the burglary statute. State v. Archuleta, 2015-NMCA-037,overrulingState v.Tower, 2002-NMCA-109, 133 N.M. 32, 59 P.3d 1264, and cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nEffect of trespass notice.— A defendant, previously given trespass notice by a store that any subsequent entry would be considered criminal trespass, who later enters the store for the purpose of shoplifting, may be charged and convicted for burglary, as the entry was unauthorized.State v. Tower, 2002-NMCA-109, 133 N.M. 32, 59 P.3d 1264, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 30, 59 P.3d 1262.\n\nBurglary of vehicle separate offense from taking or tampering.— The offense of burglary of a motor vehicle requires an unauthorized entry. Unauthorized entry is not an element of either unlawful taking of a vehicle, Section 66-3-504 NMSA 1978 (now Section 30-16D-1 NMSA 1978) , or tampering with a vehicle, Section 66-3-506 NMSA 1978 (now Section 30-16D-5 NMSA 1978) . This difference in the elements of the offenses is sufficient ground to reject the defendant's contention that the statutes are the same and that he should not be charged with the more general burglary charge.State v. Hernandez, 1993-NMCA-132, 116 N.M. 562, 865 P.2d 1206, cert. denied, 116 N.M. 801, 867 P.2d 1183.\n\nPenetration by instrument.— Evidence of a break-in by use of an instrument which penetrates into the building is evidence of entry into the building, and the sufficiency of this evidence is not destroyed by a failure to prove that the instrument was used to steal something from the building or to commit another felony.State v. Tixier, 1976-NMCA-054, 89 N.M. 297, 551 P.2d 987.\n\nUnoccupied structure still \"dwelling house\".— A structure, even if unoccupied for a year, does not lose its character as a \"dwelling house\" for purposes of Subsection A, unless there is evidence that the last tenant has abandoned the structure with no intention of returning.State v. Ervin, 1981-NMCA-068, 96 N.M. 366, 630 P.2d 765.\n\nAttached garage with no opening to house was part of dwelling housewithin the meaning of this section because the garage was a part of the habitation, directly contiguous to and a functioning part of the residence.State v. Lara, 1978-NMCA-112, 92 N.M. 274, 587 P.2d 52, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 260, 586 P.2d 1089.\n\n\"Other structure\" construed literally.— Under this section the legislature intended the term \"other structure\" to be construed in its literal sense and that it not be limited by the specific language preceding it.State v. Gonzales, 1967-NMSC-168, 78 N.M. 218, 430 P.2d 376.\n\nFood store included.— Under this section ejusdem generis is resorted to merely as an aid in determining legislative intent and does not foreclose the inclusion of a food store within the term \"other structure.\"State v. Gonzales, 1967-NMSC-168, 78 N.M. 218, 430 P.2d 376.\n\nEntry into soft drink vending machine.— The term \"structure\" as set forth in this section does not include the unauthorized entry into a soft drink vending machine located outside a building or other structure with intent to commit a felony or theft within.State v. Bybee, 1989-NMCA-071, 109 N.M. 44, 781 P.2d 316.\n\nEntering open store.— A person who enters a store open to the public with intent to shoplift or commit larceny is not guilty of burglary.State v. Rogers, 1972-NMCA-053, 83 N.M. 676, 496 P.2d 169.\n\nEntry into inner door.— Where there is lawful entry into a building, an unauthorized entry into an inner door of any unit with the necessary intent may be prosecuted for burglary.State v. Ortega, 1974-NMCA-060, 86 N.M. 350, 524 P.2d 522.\n\nReaching into bed of pickup truckwith the intent to commit a felony may constitute a burglary within the meaning of this section.State v. Rodriguez, 1984-NMCA-034, 101 N.M. 192, 679 P.2d 1290, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 189, 679 P.2d 1287.\n\nPost office box deemed \"structure\".— A post office box was a \"structure\" within the meaning of this section. The separately secured area that constituted the structure was the area consisting of the mail sorting room and the post office boxes, the backs of which opened into the sorting room.State v. Gregory, 1993-NMCA-146, 117 N.M. 104, 869 P.2d 292, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 215, 870 P.2d 753 (1994).\n\nFence does not constitute \"structure\"within the meaning of this section.State v. Foulenfont, 1995-NMCA-028, 119 N.M. 788, 895 P.2d 1329, cert. quashed, 120 N.M. 498, 903 P.2d 240.\n\nIdentity of place.— The identity of the place burglarized was an essential element of crime denounced by Laws 1853-1854, p. 100, §§ 11 (40-9-6, 1953 Comp., relating to breaking and entering into places other than dwellings).State v. Salazar, 1938-NMSC-021, 42 N.M. 308, 77 P.2d 633 (decided under prior law).\n\nIntent to commit felony under burglary statute includes general criminal intent.— When one intends to commit a felony or theft under the burglary statute, one also has the general criminal intent of purposely doing an act even though he may not know the act is unlawful.State v. Ruiz, 1980-NMCA-123, 94 N.M. 771, 617 P.2d 160.\n\nSpecific intent to commit felony or theft is essential elementof the state's case to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the gravamen of the offense of burglary being the intent with which the structure is entered.State v. Elliott, 1975-NMCA-087, 88 N.M. 187, 539 P.2d 207,rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-030, 89 N.M. 305, 551 P.2d 1352;State v. Ortega, 1968-NMCA-092, 79 N.M. 707, 448 P.2d 813.\n\nIntent to steal vehicle sufficient.— An intent to steal the car is an intent to commit a theft \"therein.\" Theft of the car itself may be an offense committed within the vehicle. If one intends to commit in a car acts that accomplish the crime, then one intends to commit the crime in the car. Theft of a car can be accomplished from within the vehicle.State v. Hernandez, 1993-NMCA-132, 116 N.M. 562, 865 P.2d 1206, cert. denied, 116 N.M. 801, 867 P.2d 1183.\n\nIntent measured at time of entry.— A specific intent to commit a felony must exist and may be measured at the time of the claimed unauthorized entry into the home of the prosecutrix.State v. Elliott, 1975-NMCA-087, 88 N.M. 187, 539 P.2d 207,rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-030, 89 N.M. 305, 551 P.2d 1352.\n\nEntry without intent not burglary.— Absent any proof that entry had been made with an intent to commit a felony, the act of prying a lock did not constitute burglary.State v. Grubaugh, 1950-NMSC-044, 54 N.M. 272, 221 P.2d 1055.\n\nIntoxication may be shown to negate existence of required intentin a prosecution for burglary, and where defendant claims absence of intent due to intoxication, the issue of intent is for the jury.State v. Gonzales, 1971-NMCA-007, 82 N.M. 388, 482 P.2d 252, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 377, 482 P.2d 241.\n\nVoluntary intoxication as defense.— Voluntary intoxication is not a defense to a charge of larceny unless defendant was so intoxicated as to be unable to form the necessary intent.State v. Lucero, 1962-NMSC-077, 70 N.M. 268, 372 P.2d 837.\n\nBurglary requires that entry be with the specific intent to commit a felony or theft; intoxication may be shown to negate this specific intent.State v. Ruiz, 1980-NMCA-123, 94 N.M. 771, 617 P.2d 160.\n\nBurglary does not depend upon actions after the entry,the crime being complete when there is an unauthorized entry with the intent to commit a felony or theft.State v. Tixier, 1976-NMCA-054, 89 N.M. 297, 551 P.2d 987.\n\nStealing is not necessary element of burglary.State v. Ford, 1970-NMCA-061, 81 N.M. 556, 469 P.2d 535.\n\nProof of theft unnecessary.— When entry is accomplished with intent to steal it is not a required element of proof to show that any property was actually taken.State v. Ortega, 1968-NMCA-092, 79 N.M. 707, 448 P.2d 813.\n\nTo prove burglary, the state was not required to prove either that defendant stole something or ownership of any articles stolen.State v. Gutierrez, 1971-NMCA-058, 82 N.M. 578, 484 P.2d 1288, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 562, 484 P.2d 1272.\n\nPossession of stolen property immaterial.— Proof that property was actually taken is not necessary nor is proof of possession of a stolen item.State v. Wilkerson, 1972-NMCA-067, 83 N.M. 770, 497 P.2d 981.\n\nTo prove burglary, the state was not required to prove defendant's possession of stolen articles.State v. Ford, 1970-NMCA-061, 81 N.M. 556, 469 P.2d 535.\n\nProof of burglary.— The state is not required to prove dominion, control or possession. Evidence of dominion, control or possession of the stolen property is admissible on the questions of entry and intent.State v. Hinojos, 1967-NMCA-003, 78 N.M. 32, 427 P.2d 683.\n\nPossession of tools immaterial.— Although burglary tools are admissible in evidence in a prosecution for burglary, it is not necessary to have burglary tools in one's possession to violate this section.State v. Everitt, 1969-NMCA-010, 80 N.M. 41, 450 P.2d 927.\n\nIV. INDICTMENT AND INFORMATION.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nAccessory prosecuted as principal.— Although defendant never entered burglarized building, he was an aider and abettor or he was an accessory as defined in 30-1-13 NMSA 1978 and could therefore be prosecuted as a principal.State v. Riley, 1970-NMCA-015, 82 N.M. 298, 480 P.2d 693.\n\nAllegation of ownership unnecessary.— An allegation or proof of ownership of a building or structure, the subject of a burglary charge, is unnecessary.State v. Flores, 1971-NMCA-036, 82 N.M. 480, 483 P.2d 1320.\n\nOwnership for identification.— This section clearly does not require that ownership of the building or structure entered be alleged, nor is such allegation necessary to charge the offense. Accordingly, except as a means of identification, an allegation or proof of ownership of a building or structure the subject of a burglary charge is unnecessary.State v. Ford, 1969-NMCA-092, 80 N.M. 649, 459 P.2d 353.\n\nModel and license of burglarized vehicle.— Where the essential elements of the crime of burglary of an automobile were established, the model and license of the vehicle were surplusage in the indictment which did not need to be proved, and failure to do so did not constitute reversible error.State v. Newman, 1971-NMCA-137, 83 N.M. 165, 489 P.2d 673.\n\nValue of property.— Under 40-9-6, 1953 Comp., prescribing penalties for breaking and entering into places other than dwelling with intent to commit murder, rape, robbery, larceny or any felony, term \"larceny\" was not limited to \"grand larceny\" under 40-45-2, 1953 Comp., and since stealing property of any value was a felony, a value over $50.00 did not have to be specified in the information nor proved in a charge of attempt.State v. Serrano, 1964-NMSC-161, 74 N.M. 412, 394 P.2d 262 (decided under former law).\n\nCharge sufficient.— Charge that defendant \"burglarized\" an outhouse belonging to a named individual in the nighttime was sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the court in that it charged a public offense.State v. Mares, 1956-NMSC-031, 61 N.M. 46, 294 P.2d 284 (decided under former law).\n\nB. VARIANCE.\n\nMaterial variance between places charged and proved.— Where proof identified burglarized shop as that of Joe Howard, and indictment charged burglary of \"the Harvey Cleaners,\" and there was no showing of identity, there was a material variance.State v. Salazar, 1938-NMSC-021, 42 N.M. 308, 77 P.2d 633 (decided under former law).\n\nVariance not jurisdictional.— Variance between indictment and proof regarding name and address of party and place burglarized was not jurisdictional because it can be cured by verdict of the jury.State v. Jaramillo, 1973-NMCA-029, 85 N.M. 19, 508 P.2d 1316, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 5, 508 P.2d 1302, 414 U.S. 1000, 94 S. Ct. 353, 38 L. Ed. 2d 236 (1973) (decided under former law).\n\nNature of building.— An indictment was not defective for calling a building where goods were sold a \"shop,\" though witnesses at the trial called it a \"store.\"State v. Padilla, 1914-NMSC-012, 18 N.M. 573, 139 P. 143 (decided under former law).\n\nRaising variance.— Variance between charge and proof regarding nature of building burglarized could not be raised for the first time by motion in arrest of judgment or motion for a new trial.State v. Mares, 1956-NMSC-031, 61 N.M. 46, 294 P.2d 284 (decided under former law).\n\nV. EVIDENCE.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nOrdinarily, burglary must be proved by circumstantial evidencesufficient to submit the issue to the jury, since such an offense can rarely be proved by witnesses who saw and recognized a defendant in the act of making an unauthorized entry with intent to commit a theft.State v. Johnson, 1972-NMCA-082, 84 N.M. 29, 498 P.2d 1372.\n\nExclusion of every reasonable hypothesis save guilt.— To support a conviction testimony must do more than raise a strong suspicion of guilt as the evidence and reasonable inferences that flow therefrom must exclude every reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the defendant.State v. Heim, 1971-NMCA-159, 83 N.M. 260, 490 P.2d 1233.\n\nCircumstantial evidence.— Where circumstances alone are relied upon by the prosecution, the circumstances must be such as to apply exclusively to defendant, and such as are reconcilable with no other hypothesis than defendant's guilt.State v. Montano, 1972-NMCA-021, 83 N.M. 523, 494 P.2d 185.\n\nSpecific intent to commit theftmay be proven by inference from established facts and circumstances.State v. Ortega, 1968-NMCA-092, 79 N.M. 707, 448 P.2d 813.\n\nBreaking and entering justifies inference.— In the absence of inconsistent circumstances, proof of unlawful breaking and entry into a building which contains personal property that could be the subject of larceny gives rise to an inference that will sustain a conviction of burglary, grounded in human experience, which justifies the assumption that the unlawful entry was not purposeless, and, in the absence of other proof, indicates theft as the most likely purpose.State v. Ortega, 1968-NMCA-092, 79 N.M. 707, 448 P.2d 813.\n\nPresence plus inferences.— Although presence alone is insufficient to sustain a conviction for burglary when the facts and reasonable inferences therefrom show much more than mere presence, there is substantial evidence to support the conviction.State v. Sedillo, 1971-NMCA-003, 82 N.M. 287, 480 P.2d 401.\n\nUnauthorized presence in vehicle.— A jury might reasonably infer from a defendant's unauthorized presence in a vehicle that he had the necessary intent to commit a felony or theft therein.State v. Wilkerson, 1972-NMCA-067, 83 N.M. 770, 497 P.2d 981.\n\nPossession of stolen property not enough.— Recently stolen property found in the possession of a defendant will not alone support a conclusion of guilt of the offense of burglary unless there is evidence of other circumstances connecting the defendant with the crime charged.State v. Heim, 1971-NMCA-159, 83 N.M. 260, 490 P.2d 1233.\n\nFacts pointing unerringly to guilt.— Where the facts and circumstances do not unerringly point to defendant's guilt of burglary and do not establish inferentially or otherwise that defendant's entry was unauthorized, the judgment and sentence must be reversed.State v. Slade, 1967-NMCA-027, 78 N.M. 581, 434 P.2d 700.\n\nEstablishing aiding and abetting.— Aiding and abetting a burglary is established by evidence of a community of purpose or a shared criminal intent in the unlawful undertaking, such that by any of the means of communicating thought defendant incited, encouraged or instigated commission of the offense or made it known that commission of an offense already undertaken had aider's support or approval.State v. Gonzales, 1971-NMCA-007, 82 N.M. 388, 482 P.2d 252, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 377, 482 P.2d 241.\n\nB. ADMISSIBILITY.\n\nCharacter evidence.— Honesty and truthfulness are pertinent character traits that are admissible under Rule 11-404(A)(1) in a prosecution for solicitation to commit burglary.State v. Martinez, 2008-NMSC-060, 145 N.M. 220, 195 P.3d 1232.\n\nEvidence of dominion, control or possessionof stolen property is admissible on the questions of entry and intent.State v. Hinojos, 1967-NMCA-003, 78 N.M. 32, 427 P.2d 683.\n\nEvidence of dominion, control or possession of stolen property is admissible on the question of intent.State v. Montano, 1972-NMCA-021, 83 N.M. 523, 494 P.2d 185.\n\nDiscovery of weapons relevant.— Where defendant was convicted of burglary as accessory, argument that testimony concerning weapons found in defendant's car after his arrest was irrelevant to issues raised by indictment was without merit.State v. Gunzelman, 1973-NMCA-121, 85 N.M. 535, 514 P.2d 54,overruled on other grounds byState v. Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, 113 N.M. 780, 833 P.2d 1146.\n\nProving unauthorized entry.— New Mexico does not restrict the method of proving unauthorized entry and it may be proved by circumstantial evidence.State v. Mireles, 1971-NMCA-027, 82 N.M. 453, 483 P.2d 508.\n\nSubstantial evidence of intent to commit burglary.— Where defendant was discovered lying underneath a van; next to defendant was a plastic container positioned under the van to catch fuel dripping from the gas tank of the van; defendant admitted that defendant had used a nail to create a hole in the tank so that gas could escape; and the owner of the van had not abandoned the van and had not given defendant permission to enter or remove gas from the van, there was substantial evidence to support the finding that defendant possessed the intent necessary to commit burglary.State v. Muqqddin, 2010-NMCA-069, 148 N.M. 845, 242 P.3d 412, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-008, 148 N.M. 943, 242 P.3d 1289.\n\nC. SUFFICIENCY.\n\nSubstantial evidence of intent to commit burglary.— Where defendant was discovered lying underneath a van; next to defendant was a plastic container positioned under the van to catch fuel dripping from the gas tank of the van; defendant admitted that defendant had used a nail to create a hole in the tank so that gas could escape; and the owner of the van had not abandoned the van and had not given defendant permission to enter or remove gas from the van, there was substantial evidence to support the finding that defendant possessed the intent necessary to commit burglary.State v. Muqqddin, 2010-NMCA-069, 148 N.M. 845, 242 P.3d 412, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-008, 148 N.M. 942, 242 P.3d 1288.\n\nInference of intent permissible.— Defendant's motion for a directed verdict was properly denied because the jury could have properly inferred that defendant was the person who burglarized the building, and that the jacket and knife found in the vent, therefore belonged to defendant.State v. Barragan, 2001-NMCA-086, 131 N.M. 281, 34 P.3d 1157.\n\nInference of intent to commit felony.— Evidence that a store's burglary alarm system was triggered, that police officers responded within a minute after being called, that there was a four-by-eight-inch hole in a garage door near the opening mechanism, that defendant was found hiding in tires outside the building near the door, that the piece of door which had been removed in making the hole was found in the same area and that the store had been closed at 5:30 p.m., while the alarm went off shortly after 10:00 p.m. permitted an inference that defendant intended to commit a felony or theft inside the store.State v. Tixier, 1976-NMCA-054, 89 N.M. 297, 551 P.2d 987.\n\nInference of criminal intent.— Victim's house was broken into; defendant helped carry stolen items away over four foot fence in back of house; he was recognized by the victim's neighbor while carrying some of the stolen items; some stolen items were concealed; and defendant fled when discovered, although subsequently returned to the vicinity of the victim's house. These facts were evidence sufficient to sustain an inference of criminal intent.State v. Peden, 1973-NMCA-095, 85 N.M. 363, 512 P.2d 691.\n\nInference of intent.— Where defendant's companion completed crime of burglary by an unauthorized entry with the necessary intent, and defendant knew this fact, was present and participated, his intent could be inferred from his acts.State v. Riley, 1970-NMCA-015, 82 N.M. 298, 480 P.2d 693.\n\nWhere defendant was caught in a public schoolhouse on a Sunday afternoon by two police officers and upon being searched for weapons several items taken from desk or storage cabinet in principal's office were discovered, the evidence substantially supported a reasonable inference of defendant's intent to commit a theft in the schoolhouse which he had entered without authorization.State v. Lujan, 1970-NMCA-087, 82 N.M. 95, 476 P.2d 65.\n\nIn prosecution for burglary, larceny and unlawful taking of a vehicle, evidence of the time factors, distances, observations of defendants, locations and possession of stolen goods pointed unerringly to defendants and excluded every reasonable hypothesis other than guilt.State v. Sanchez, 1971-NMCA-065, 82 N.M. 585, 484 P.2d 1295.\n\nBreaking of window indicative of intent.— Jury, after they found that defendant shattered the grocery store window, validly inferred that window was broken in an attempt to enter and unlawfully take property from inside the store, and that he acted with criminal intent.State v. Serrano, 1964-NMSC-161, 74 N.M. 412, 394 P.2d 262.\n\nIntent absent.— Testimony by the prosecutrix that she engaged in sexual intercourse with defendant, along with his acquittal on rape charge, suggests that jury found that the sexual intercourse took place with consent of the prosecutrix and that defendant did not enter her home with intent to commit rape, and thus the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for burglary.State v. Elliott, 1975-NMCA-087, 88 N.M. 187, 539 P.2d 207,rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-030, 89 N.M. 305, 551 P.2d 1352.\n\nInsufficient evidence of intent to commit a theft or criminal damage to property.— Where defendant was convicted of residential burglary based on DNA evidence found in the burglarized house, there was insufficient evidence to permit a rational jury to find the essential facts to establish each element of the crime of residential burglary beyond a reasonable doubt, because although there was evidence that defendant had entered the property without authorization, the state, without presenting any evidence linking defendant to the stolen items or the property damage, failed to establish, either directly or by circumstantial evidence, that defendant entered the dwelling with the intent to commit a theft or criminal damage to property when inside.State v. Ledbetter, 2020-NMCA-046.\n\nProof beyond reasonable doubt.— Where unlawful entry and a description of items stolen were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, this was sufficient to sustain the conviction under this statute.State v. Baca, 1974-NMCA-022, 86 N.M. 144, 520 P.2d 872.\n\nGuilt as only reasonable hypothesis.— Defendant's flight when officers arrived indicated consciousness of guilt, and together with fact that he came to store with intent of breaking in and gave a false name when arrested, absent an explanation of his reasons or motive, permitted an inference of guilt, excluding every other reasonable hypothesis.State v. Gonzales, 1971-NMCA-007, 82 N.M. 388, 482 P.2d 252, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 377, 482 P.2d 241.\n\nHypothesis in defense.— Defendant's hypothesis that actual burglar had been frightened away by appearance of defendant since there was no evidence introduced concerning fingerprints, defendant was not wearing gloves and officers found nothing on defendant classified as burglar tools, was not reasonable in the light of the jury verdict which necessarily determined that defendant was inside burglarized apartment, and in light of undisputed evidence of a torn screen, open door and \"mess\" inside the apartment.State v. Madrid, 1972-NMSC-016, 83 N.M. 603, 495 P.2d 383.\n\nUnauthorized entry established.— Circumstantial evidence may be used to establish an unauthorized entry, and evidence showing that defendant and companions went to liquor store with intent to break in, taking a sledgehammer, that windows were broken, that the men fled the scene and that bottles of liquor were missing, pointed unerringly to an unauthorized entry.State v. Gonzales, 1971-NMCA-007, 82 N.M. 388, 482 P.2d 252, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 377, 482 P.2d 241.\n\nSlight penetration sufficient.— Evidence that an unidentified instrument penetrated one-half inch inside a building was sufficient evidence of entry to sustain a burglary conviction, since any penetration, however slight, of the interior space is sufficient.State v. Tixier, 1976-NMCA-054, 89 N.M. 297, 551 P.2d 987.\n\nEvidence supporting conviction.— Evidence that a fingerprint lifted from a coke machine which had been broken into during a burglary was the same as that on defendant's fingerprint card, on the basis of a ten point comparison taken from defendant under controlled circumstances, and that although gas station operator testified that his son had access to key to machine he also stated that to his knowledge his son never opened it, was sufficient to support conviction.State v. Douglas, 1974-NMCA-087, 86 N.M. 665, 526 P.2d 807, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 656, 526 P.2d 798.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where store manager testified that he had checked the building just before he left the previous evening and that it was securely locked, that a window found broken shortly after defendant's apprehension had not been broken the evening before and that no one, including the defendant, was authorized to enter the store after closing time, and evidence showed that defendant, seen near the store in the early morning when all the businesses were closed, ran when a police officer attempted to stop him for questioning, dropped two bags which contained merchandise from the store, evidence was sufficient, albeit circumstantial, for the jury to infer that defendant committed burglary.State v. Lauderdale, 1973-NMCA-035, 85 N.M. 157, 509 P.2d 1352, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 144, 509 P.2d 1339.\n\nEvidence, including positive identification of defendant and testimony as to his presence in cab of burglarized pick-up, along with business papers kept in truck which were found on the ground near the pick-up and in the alley near which the defendant was apprehended, sustained burglary conviction.State v. Wilkerson, 1972-NMCA-067, 83 N.M. 770, 497 P.2d 981.\n\nWhere evidence was clear that the residence had been entered with an intent to commit theft as various items of personal property had been stolen and homeowner testified that to gain entrance the window would have had to be forced open, presence of defendant's prints on inside portion of the window was sufficient to point to defendant as the one who entered the house and stole the property.State v. Mireles, 1971-NMCA-027, 82 N.M. 453, 483 P.2d 508.\n\nEvidence is sufficient to support a defendant's burglary conviction where the defendant, a security guard and associate member of a club, makes an unauthorized entry into the club after closing hours by breaking the club's door, then breaking into a bar cabinet and slot machine.State v. Carter, 1979-NMCA-117, 93 N.M. 500, 601 P.2d 733, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 683, 604 P.2d 821.\n\nWhere defendant admitted that he and accomplice \"ransacked\" the victim's residence and removed at least two pistols and three long firearms, this is sufficient evidence for the conviction of burglary.State v. Lopez, 2005-NMSC-036, 138 N.M. 521, 123 P.3d 754,overruled on other grounds byState v. Frawley, 2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\n\"Dwelling house\" construed.— To determine whether a structure constitutes a dwelling house, the court considers the evidence presented regarding the physical characteristics of the structure to determine whether it is a type of structure customarily used for living quarters and in which possessory and privacy interests of habitation should be protected, and examines whether the structure was actually used for living quarters, whether its purpose was for habitation, and whether its use as living quarters was sufficient to warrant protection of the heightened privacy and possessory interests of habitation.State v. Shelby, 2021-NMCA-064, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of burglary of a \"dwelling house\".— Where defendant was convicted of burglary of a dwelling, larceny over $2,500, and criminal damage to property over $1,000, and where defendant claimed that his conviction for burglary of a dwelling was not supported by sufficient evidence because the interior of the house at issue was under construction, it lacked electricity and running water, and the evidence did not show that the owner \"customarily used\" the house \"as living quarters\" under the definition of \"dwelling house,\" as set out in UJI 14-1631 NMRA, the evidence sufficiently established that the structure entered was a dwelling house within the meaning and purpose of the burglary statute and UJI 14-1631, because the state presented evidence that the structure was a house with an enclosed, finished exterior, the house was used for habitation in a regular, yet intermittent, way, and the apparent purpose of the house was for habitation.State v. Shelby, 2021-NMCA-064, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of burglary of a vehicle.— Where surveillance video evidence showed a dark-colored pickup truck enter a motel parking lot in the early morning hours and showed a person identified by the arresting officer as defendant forcibly entering and removing items from two vehicles, and where, during a custodial interview, defendant made statements to the effect that he did not remember what he took and did not know the whereabouts of the items taken from the vehicles, and where the arresting officer testified that he observed defendant forcibly enter two other vehicles at a different motel, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions on four counts of burglary of a vehicle.State v. Sweat, 2017-NMCA-069, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of conspiracy to commit burglary.— Where defendant, a former employee of a motel, asked the motel desk clerk to attend to an internet problem in the motel by implying that he was a motel guest, which he was not, and where defendant remained in the lobby while his co-conspirator climbed over the desk clerk's counter, broke the lock on a cash drawer and removed cash, and where defendant immediately followed the co-conspirator out of the motel lobby after the co-conspirator took the cash, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to infer that defendant, as a former employee of the motel, knew the location of the cash drawer, that asking the desk clerk to reset the wireless router would require the clerk to be away from the office for a sufficient amount of time to create an opportunity to steal the cash and escape without notice, and that defendant and his accomplice agreed and intended to commit the crime of burglary.State v. Mestas, 2016-NMCA-047.\n\nCircumstantial evidence sufficient.— Facts regarding the defendants' actions and the surrounding circumstances provided sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer that defendants intended to break into a building and commit a theft therein.State v. Jennings, 1984-NMCA-051, 102 N.M. 89, 691 P.2d 882, cert. quashed, 102 N.M. 88, 691 P.2d 881.\n\nUnexplained possession with other circumstances.— While unexplained possession of goods belonging to another does not raise presumption that a larceny has been committed and that the possessor is a thief, additional evidence being necessary to establish the corpus delicti, nevertheless additional evidence, consisting of the fact that a robbery had been committed, the early hour of the morning, the lack of identification, the giving of a false name and defendant's statement that he was on his way home which was in the southwest quadrant of the city when he was walking north, was sufficient to sustain a conviction for burglary.State v. Rivera, 1973-NMCA-145, 85 N.M. 723, 516 P.2d 694.\n\nSufficiency of evidence.— Evidence that defendant possessed recently stolen property which he acquired by theft, together with evidence of defendant's presence at the scene near the time of the crime with a person who knew the precise location of the property, permitted the inference that defendant stole the guns during an unauthorized entry of owner's residence, and was sufficient to sustain his conviction for burglary.State v. Jordan, 1975-NMCA-102, 88 N.M. 230, 539 P.2d 620.\n\nEvidence, though partly circumstantial, supported conviction for burglary, where soda pop of kind and amount stolen was found in possession of defendant near the place where pop had been stolen, defendant had prevailed upon acquaintances to take him to the vicinity of the storage shed for the purpose of getting some pop, when being investigated defendant admitted the theft, and a footprint similar to defendant's was found in the burglarized shed.State v. Waits, 1966-NMSC-162, 76 N.M. 630, 417 P.2d 439.\n\nAiding and abetting shown.— Although defendant's witness testified that defendant was unaware that witness was removing stereo tape deck from automobile, where evidence showed that defendant and witness looked into another car before witness broke into the burglarized car and that defendant leaned on the door of the burglarized car and was \"looking both ways as if observing for something,\" this evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction as an aider and abettor under this section.State v. Sandoval, 1972-NMCA-038, 83 N.M. 599, 495 P.2d 379.\n\nEvidence insufficient.— Although similarity between footprints, and tire prints, along with defendant's locations, actions and statements, created a suspicion that he committed the offense charged, it could not be said that there were not other reasonable hypotheses which permitted a finding of his innocence and hence circumstantial evidence solely relied upon by state, failed to meet the standard required.State v. Seal, 1965-NMSC-154, 75 N.M. 608, 409 P.2d 128;State v. Waits, 1966-NMSC-162, 76 N.M. 630, 417 P.2d 439;State v. Sharp, 1967-NMSC-169, 78 N.M. 220, 430 P.2d 378;State v. Williamson, 1968-NMSC-033, 78 N.M. 751, 438 P.2d 161, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 891, 89 S. Ct. 212, 21 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1968);Nance v. State, 1969-NMCA-018, 80 N.M. 123, 452 P.2d 192.\n\nWhere at best the state showed that defendant had constructive possession of certain stolen jewelry by virtue of occupying along with another individual the same room in which it was found, but there was no evidence showing or tending to show that he had knowledge, control or voice in the power of disposal of the jewelry, evidence was insufficient to permit issue of defendant's guilt on burglary charge to go to the jury.State v. Romero, 1960-NMSC-047, 67 N.M. 82, 352 P.2d 781.\n\nRaising insufficiency of evidence.— On appeal from denial of post-conviction relief, petitioner's contentions that he should not have been charged with and convicted of aggravated burglary, that the state failed to prove criminal intent and that he was intoxicated at the time of the offense and could not have had the requisite intent, not having been raised on direct appeal, did not provide a basis for post-conviction relief.Andrada v. State, 1971-NMCA-184, 83 N.M. 393, 492 P.2d 1010.\n\nWhere in a prosecution for burglary the question of sufficiency of the evidence was not presented to the trial court, defendant could not demand a review of the evidence as a matter of right, but in case at hand appellate court would examine the record to determine if fundamental error was committed.State v. Sedillo, 1969-NMCA-107, 81 N.M. 47, 462 P.2d 632, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 40, 462 P.2d 625.\n\nVI. INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nInstruction on specific intent required.— Since the crime of burglary is a crime requiring a specific mens rea, an instruction on specific intent or specific mens rea is required.State v. Gunzelman, 1973-NMSC-055, 85 N.M. 295, 512 P.2d 55,overruled on other grounds byState v. Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, 113 N.M. 780, 833 P.2d 1146.\n\nFailure to give instructionconcerning criminal intent is jurisdictional and may be raised for the first time on appeal.State v. Gunzelman, 1973-NMSC-055, 85 N.M. 295, 512 P.2d 55,overruled on other grounds byState v. Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, 113 N.M. 780, 833 P.2d 1146.\n\nLanguage of statute adequate.— Since this section defines the element of intent constituting the crime of burglary, an instruction which follows the language of the statute adequately instructs the jury on the specific criminal intent required.State v. Gunzelman, 1973-NMSC-055, 85 N.M. 295, 512 P.2d 55,overruled on other grounds byState v. Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, 113 N.M. 780, 833 P.2d 1146.\n\nSufficiency of instruction.— Instruction that any person who, without authorization, enters a dwelling house with intent to commit any felony or theft therein is guilty of burglary of a dwelling house was sufficient on the element of criminal intent.State v. Baca, 1973-NMCA-054, 85 N.M. 55, 508 P.2d 1352.\n\nAdditional instruction on general criminal intent was unnecessaryin prosecution for burglary as a person is presumed to intend the logical consequences of his actions.State v. Gunzelman, 1973-NMSC-055, 85 N.M. 295, 512 P.2d 55,overruled on other grounds byState v. Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, 113 N.M. 780, 833 P.2d 1146.\n\nIntoxication instruction properly refused.— Requested instruction telling jury to acquit defendant if he \"did not have the intent to commit the unlawful act of burglary as a result of intoxication\" was properly refused because of its wording, which would have required jury to accept, as a fact, the matter of intoxication which was for the jury to decide.State v. Gonzales, 1971-NMCA-007, 82 N.M. 388, 482 P.2d 252, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 377, 482 P.2d 241.\n\nPresumption of innocence adequately covered.— In prosecution for burglary, where instructions were given on the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof, court's refusal to instruct that there was no presumption that defendant was an accessory and that he did not have the burden of proving that he was not an accessory was not error.State v. Gunzelman, 1973-NMCA-121, 85 N.M. 535, 514 P.2d 54,overruled on other grounds byState v. Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, 113 N.M. 780, 833 P.2d 1146.\n\nSubmission of lesser offense unnecessary.— Offense of unlawfully carrying a deadly weapon is neither a degree of burglary, nor the higher degree of aggravated burglary, and not being an included offense, trial court did not err in refusing to submit to the jury the offense of unlawfully carrying a deadly weapon as a lesser included offense.State v. Andrada, 1971-NMCA-033, 82 N.M. 543, 484 P.2d 763, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 534, 484 P.2d 754.\n\nInstruction on accomplice's testimony.— In trial for burglary, instruction that an accused may be convicted upon the testimony of an accomplice, even though it is uncorroborated, was proper.State v. Baca, 1973-NMCA-054, 85 N.M. 55, 508 P.2d 1352.\n\nInstruction misstating victim's name and address.— Error in instruction misstating name and address of burglary victim, to which defendant did not object, was not preserved for review and did not constitute fundamental error.State v. Jaramillo, 1973-NMCA-029, 85 N.M. 19, 508 P.2d 1316, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 5, 508 P.2d 1302, 414 U.S. 1000, 94 S. Ct. 353, 38 L. Ed. 2d 236 (1973).\n\nFailure to request instruction.— Counsel's failure to request an instruction to the effect that intoxication would relieve the defendant of criminal responsibility if he were unable to form the criminal intent required for the commission of the crime of burglary may have been no more than bad strategy on the part of counsel, so that it could not be said, as a matter of law, that representation was so inadequate as to deprive him of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.State v. Samora, 1971-NMCA-001, 82 N.M. 252, 479 P.2d 532.\n\nAttorney general opinions.— The phrase \"or any other felony,\" in former 40-9-6, 1953 Comp., dealing with crime of breaking and entering into places other than dwellings, was indicative that this section of the statute only applied to a breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony. 1955 Op.

      "text": "Aggravated burglary consists of the unauthorized entry of any vehicle, watercraft, aircraft, dwelling or other structure, movable or immovable, with intent to commit any felony or theft therein and the person either:\n\nA. is armed with a deadly weapon;\n\nB. after entering, arms himself with a deadly weapon;\n\nC. commits a battery upon any person while in such place, or in entering or leaving such place.\n\nWhoever commits aggravated burglary is guilty of a second degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-16-4, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 16-4.\n\nCross references.— For definition of deadly weapon,see30-1-12 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor battery,see30-3-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor instruction as to essential elements of aggravated burglary,seeUJI 14-1632 NMRA.\n\nThe unit of prosecution for aggravated burglary is an unlawful entry with intent to commit a felony.— When there is only one unauthorized entry, there can only be one aggravated burglary, even if defendant commits multiple aggravating acts.State v. Swick, 2012-NMSC-018, 279 P.3d 747,rev'g2010-NMCA-098, 148 N.M. 895, 242 P.3d 462 andoverrulingState v. Armendariz, 2006-NMSC-036, 140 N.M. 182, 141 P.3d 526.\n\nConvictions of aggravated burglary while committing a battery and aggravated burglary with a deadly weapon violated double jeopardy.— Where defendant, who was armed with a knife and who intended to steal a vehicle from the victims, entered the victims' home, stabbed one victim, and beat and stabbed the other victim; and defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary while committing a battery and aggravated burglary with a deadly weapon, defendant's convictions violated the prohibition against double jeopardy.State v. Swick, 2012-NMSC-018, 279 P.3d 747,rev'g2010-NMCA-098, 148 N.M. 895, 242 P.3d 462 andoverrulingState v. Armendariz, 2006-NMSC-036, 140 N.M. 182, 141 P.3d 526.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Where the force used to complete aggravated burglary constituted the same force used to restrain a victim to accomplish CSP II there were insufficient indicia of distinctness differentiating the acts and a conviction on both is impermissible on double jeopardy grounds.State v. Armendariz, 2006-NMCA-152, 140 N.M. 712, 148 P.3d 198, cert. quashed, 2008-NMCERT-002, 143 N.M. 665, 180 P.3d 674.\n\nLesser included offense.— Under the facts of this case, the aggravated burglary offense could not be committed without also committing the crime of dangerous use of explosives; the explosives offense does not have an element not included in the burglary offense. The explosives offense was an offense included within the aggravated burglary offense.State v. Jacobs, 1985-NMCA-054, 102 N.M. 801, 701 P.2d 400.\n\nInstruction on lesser included offense.— When criminal trespass is factually based solely on unlawful entry, not on unlawfully remaining without consent, then criminal trespass is necessarily included within the offense of aggravated burglary of a dwelling house and a defendant is entitled to an instruction on the lesser included offense.State v. Romero, 1998-NMCA-057, 125 N.M. 161, 958 P.2d 119\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Section 30-16-4 NMSA 1978 is designed to address the heightened threat associated with possession of deadly weapons and to deter their possession in the course of burglaries even if no use is intended. By contrast, Subsection C of Section 30-16-4 NMSA 1978 is designed to address actual physical injury to persons during a burglary. Because these factors reinforce the presumption of distinct, punishable offenses, a defendant's convictions pursuant to these two separate statutory subsections do not offend double jeopardy principles.State v. Swick, 2010-NMCA-098, 148 N.M. 895, 242 P.3d 462.\n\nLegislative intent to deter firearm possession during crime.— The adoption of several statutes, one classifying aggravated burglary as a second degree felony, and the other specifying that simple burglary is a fourth-degree felony, evinces a clear legislative intention to deter the commission of burglaries and the possession of firearms during such crimes.State v. Luna, 1982-NMCA-150, 99 N.M. 76, 653 P.2d 1222, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 148, 655 P.2d 160.\n\nCrucial factor in crime of aggravated burglaryis whether the defendant has the intent to commit a felony on entering the dwelling, not whether the felony was actually committed, as the intent does not have to be consummated.State v. Castro, 1979-NMCA-023, 92 N.M. 585, 592 P.2d 185, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 621, 593 P.2d 62.\n\nMeaning of \"deadly weapon\".— Deadly weapons shall be construed to mean any kind or class of pistol or gun, whether loaded or unloaded.State v. Montano, 1961-NMSC-174, 69 N.M. 332, 367 P.2d 95.\n\nTheft is not a necessary element of aggravated burglary,which requires only the element of intent to commit any felony or theft.State v. Ranne, 1969-NMCA-029, 80 N.M. 188, 453 P.2d 209.\n\nElements of robbery and aggravated burglary are not the same,and therefore, defendant could be sentenced for each of these crimes.State v. Ranne, 1969-NMCA-029, 80 N.M. 188, 453 P.2d 209.\n\nBreaking and entering not lesser included offense.— Breaking and entering is not a lesser included offense of aggravated burglary because each offense requires an element not included in the other and, by convicting defendant of breaking and entering when he only had notice of an aggravated burglary, the trial court violated his right to notice of the charges against him.State v. Hernandez, 1999-NMCA-105, 127 N.M. 769, 987 P.2d 1156, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 149, 990 P.2d 823.\n\nLarceny of a firearm distinguished.— Aggravated burglary and larceny of a firearm are different crimes, with different elements: larceny of a firearm requires proof that the firearm was stolen but does not require proof of an unlawful entry.State v. Tisthammer, 1998-NMCA-115, 126 N.M. 52, 966 P.2d 760, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 107, 967 P.2d 447.\n\nAggravated burglary and sex offense separate crimes.— Since aggravated burglary and criminal sexual penetration in the third degree (30-9-11 NMSA 1978) each require proof of facts which the other does not and since neither offense necessarily involves the other, there would be no double jeopardy violation and no merger of the offenses despite the fact that the same evidence may go toward proving both.State v. Young, 1978-NMCA-040, 91 N.M. 647, 579 P.2d 179, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 751, 580 P.2d 972, and cert. denied, 439 U.S. 957, 99 S. Ct. 357, 58 L. Ed. 2d 348 (1978).\n\nWhere the victim awoke and found the defendant on top of her and the defendant told her not to move or make a noise or he would blow her head off, that was evidence of a battery. When the battery preceded sexual activity, there was evidence of an aggravated burglary apart from a sex offense, and the two offenses did not merge, nor was the \"same transaction\" test applied.State v. Archunde, 1978-NMCA-050, 91 N.M. 682, 579 P.2d 808.\n\nWhere defendant's acts constituting battery for purposes of aggravated burglary charges and acts constituting criminal sexual penetration (CSP) were separate and distinct, convictions and consecutive sentences for both CSP and aggravated burglary did not violate double jeopardy.Lucero v. Kerby, 133 F.3d 1299 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1110, 118 S. Ct. 1684, 140 L. Ed. 2d 821 (1998).\n\nAggravated burglary and attempted criminal sexual penetration merged.— Defendant's conduct consisting of his entry into a dwelling with intent to commit a felony and attempted criminal sexual penetration (CSP II) was unitary, thus his convictions for both aggravated burglary and attempted CSP II violated double jeopardy.Lucero v. Kerby, 133 F.3d 1299 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1110, 118 S. Ct. 1684, 140 L. Ed. 2d 821 (1998).\n\nAggravated burglary and first degree murder not unitary.— First degree murder and aggravated burglary were not unitary acts, and imposition of sentences for both offenses did not violate double jeopardy.State v. Livernois, 1997-NMSC-019, 123 N.M. 128, 934 P.2d 1057.\n\nIndictment adequate.— Indictment employing the name given the offense by statute and specifically referring to the section and subsection of the statute which created the offense sufficiently charged crime of aggravated burglary, despite failure to allege an entry with intent to commit a felony or theft.State v. Turner, 1970-NMCA-024, 81 N.M. 450, 468 P.2d 421, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 506, 469 P.2d 151 (decided under prior law).\n\nUnauthorized entry.— An allegation or proof of ownership of a building or structure, the subject of a burglary charge, is unnecessary.State v. Flores, 1971-NMCA-036, 82 N.M. 480, 483 P.2d 1320.\n\nEntry into separate residence of spouse.— Section 40-3-3 NMSA 1978 does not provide immunity from prosecution for burglary of a spouse's separate residence.State v. Parvilus, 2014-NMSC-028,rev'g2013-NMCA-025, 297 P.3d 1228.\n\nWhere, because of domestic problems, defendant rented a separate apartment for defendant's spouse; the parties agreed that the apartment was the spouse's separate residence, that defendant would not have a key to the apartment, and that defendant did not have the spouse's permission to enter the apartment; and several months later, defendant entered the spouse's apartment through a window, 40-3-3 NMSA 1978 did not preclude defendant's conviction for burglary of the spouse's separate dwelling.State v. Parvilus, 2014-NMSC-028,rev'g2013-NMCA-025, 297 P.3d 1228.\n\nThe plain language of Section 40-3-3 NMSA 1978renders inter-spousal burglary an impossibility because the New Mexico burglary statutes protect the possessory right to exclude and Section 40-3-3 NMSA 1978 dictates that spouses have no such right to exclude the other spouse.State v. Parvilus, 2013-NMCA-025, 297 P.3d 1228, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-001.\n\nEntry into residence of estranged spouse.— Where defendant entered defendant's estranged spouse's apartment without permission, kidnapped the victim, and killed the victim, Section 40-3-3 NMSA 1978 prohibited defendant's spouse from excluding defendant from the spouse's apartment and defendant's entry into the apartment, even with felonious purpose, did not constitute aggravated burglary as a matter of law.State v. Parvilus, 2013-NMCA-025, 297 P.3d 1228, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-001.\n\nBattery while unarmed not lesser crime.— The legislature made no distinction in severity of punishment between a defendant who commits a burglary while armed with a deadly weapon as opposed to an unarmed defendant who causes a victim physical harm by committing a battery.State v. Romero, 1994-NMCA-150, 119 N.M. 195, 889 P.2d 230, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 20, 888 P.2d 466.\n\nIntent to steal vehicle sufficient.— Breaking into a car with the intent to steal the car qualifies as an intent to commit a theft \"therein.\"State v. Griffin, 1993-NMSC-071, 116 N.M. 689, 866 P.2d 1156.\n\n\"Armed\" defined.— \"Armed\" includes a stolen deadly weapon which is easily accessible and readily available for use during the commission of the burglary whether or not it is actually on the person of the accused.State v. Padilla, 1996-NMCA-072, 122 N.M. 92, 920 P.2d 1046, cert. denied, 122 N.M. 1, 919 P.2d 409.\n\nCorroboration of use of gun.— In prosecution for aggravated burglary and aggravated battery testimony by victim that he was struck by defendant with a gun on and about his face was corroborated by fact that he recognized the gun in question, by defendant's testimony that he threw the gun away after leaving the scene and by photographs of victim showing facial cuts and abrasions; furthermore, corroboration was not required.State v. Tafoya, 1969-NMCA-073, 80 N.M. 494, 458 P.2d 98.\n\nPossession of unloaded firearm sufficient.— Subsection B (Section 30 16 4 NMSA 1978) is violated by a person who in the commission of a burglary becomes armed with an unloaded firearm. Whether a defendant is in actual possession of a firearm within the contemplation of Subsection B (Section 30-16-4 NMSA 1978) or possesses the requisite intent to commit a felony may, however, present a factual issue to be determined by the trier of fact.State v. Luna, 1982-NMCA-150, 99 N.M. 76, 653 P.2d 1222, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 148, 655 P.2d 160.\n\n\"Leaving such place\".— The legislature intended the word \"leaving\" in Subsection C (Section 30 16 4 NMSA 1978) to be given the ordinary meaning of \"departing or going away from\" and not \"losing exterior contact with\"; thus, when the burglarized area is an area of restricted access in an otherwise public building, a person will be deemed to be leaving the area so long as that person is still in the public portion of the building.State v. Romero, 1994-NMCA-150, 119 N.M. 195, 889 P.2d 230, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 20, 888 P.2d 466.\n\nCollateral offenses admissible.— Testimony of victim and corroborating witness as to an assault on the same night and in same vicinity as the crimes of aggravated burglary and aggravated battery for which defendant was on trial, offered upon issue of identity, was admissible as an exception to rule prohibiting evidence of collateral offenses.State v. Turner, 1970-NMCA-024, 81 N.M. 450, 468 P.2d 421, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 506, 469 P.2d 151.\n\nIn prosecution for aggravated burglary, armed robbery and rape, testimony of victim raped an hour after initial crime about five blocks away was admissible in order to establish characteristic conduct and defendant's possession of knife and flashlight which figured in first crime.State v. Lopez, 1969-NMCA-057, 80 N.M. 599, 458 P.2d 851, cert. denied, 80 N.M. 607, 458 P.2d 859, and cert. denied, 398 U.S. 942, 90 S. Ct. 1860, 26 L. Ed. 2d 279 (1970).\n\nConflicting evidence for jury.— Although based on certain deception tests (polygraph, sodium amytol and hypnosis) the experts considered defendant truthful in his denial, the testimony of the complaining witness presented on issue of fact for the jury, and defendant was not entitled to a directed verdict on charges of aggravated battery and aggravated burglary.State v. Turner, 1970-NMCA-024, 81 N.M. 450, 468 P.2d 421, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 506, 469 P.2d 151.\n\nIntent established.— Where defendant made an unauthorized entry into an apartment, armed with a knife, and began to kiss and fondle the female occupant who was asleep, the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant's intent upon entry was to commit an aggravated assault, and therefore he was guilty of aggravated burglary.State v. Mata, 1974-NMCA-067, 86 N.M. 548, 525 P.2d 908, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 528, 525 P.2d 888.\n\nInstructions which substantially follow language of the statuteare sufficient.State v. Lopez, 1969-NMCA-057, 80 N.M. 599, 458 P.2d 851, cert. denied, 80 N.M. 607, 458 P.2d 859, and cert. denied, 398 U.S. 942, 90 S. Ct. 1860, 26 L. Ed. 2d 279 (1970).\n\nCharge of lesser offense not warranted.— Offense of unlawfully carrying a deadly weapon is neither a degree of burglary, nor the higher degree of aggravated burglary, and not being an included offense, trial court did not err in refusing to submit to the jury the offense of unlawfully carrying a deadly weapon as a lesser included offense.State v. Andrada, 1971-NMCA-033, 82 N.M. 543, 484 P.2d 763, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 534, 484 P.2d 754.\n\nBreaking-and-entering, lesser included offense instruction rejected since no evidence to support.— Where defendant was charged with aggravated burglary, his tendered instruction on lesser included offense of breaking and entering was properly rejected because there was no evidence to support the commission of the lesser offense.State v. Smith, 1986-NMCA-089, 104 N.M. 729, 726 P.2d 883, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 702, 726 P.2d 856.\n\nInsanity defense.— Trial court committed reversible error in refusing to instruct on defense of insanity, where expert medical testimony regarding defendant's heroin addiction injected reasonable doubt as to his mental illness at the time of the burglary.State v. Flores, 1971-NMCA-036, 82 N.M. 480, 483 P.2d 1320.\n\nJuror present for police investigation.— Conviction for entering a dwelling with intent to commit a felony while armed with a deadly weapon should be reversed, where after verdict fact came to light that following commission of the crime and on the same day one juror was present in the dwelling in question with the complaining witness while two police officers who testified at trial sought latent fingerprints, on basis of which defendant was convicted.Mares v. State, 1971-NMSC-106, 83 N.M. 225, 490 P.2d 667.\n\nSufficient evidence based on testimony of an accomplice.— Where defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary based on the testimony of an accomplice, defendant's argument, that such testimony when uncorroborated by physical evidence is insufficient as a matter of law, was without merit, because the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is sufficient in law to support a verdict for aggravated burglary.State v. Montoya, 2016-NMCA-098, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence to support conviction,despite failure to preserve fingerprints or trace ownership of weapon.State v. Peterson, 1985-NMCA-109, 103 N.M. 638, 711 P.2d 915, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1052, 106 S. Ct. 1279, 89 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1986).\n\nEvidence, consisting of co-conspirator's testimony as to defendant's involvement in burglaries, was sufficient to support a conviction under this section; it is the province of the jury to determine a witness's credibility, and an appellate court will not substitute its judgment for that of the jury.State v. Tisthammer, 1998-NMCA-115, 126 N.M. 52, 966 P.2d 760, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 107, 967 P.2d 447.\n\nThere was sufficient evidence to uphold defendant's aggravated burglary conviction because (1) defendant's use of a tire iron to break into a house fell under the definition that defendant was \"armed\" with a weapon, pursuant to 30-1-12B NMSA 1978 and (the tire iron) was easily accessible and readily available for use, and (2) the use of a tire iron to break a window constituted \"entry\" under this section.State v. Alvarez-Lopez, 2003-NMCA-039, 133 N.M. 404, 62 P.3d 1286,rev'd on other grounds,State v. Alvarez-Lopez, 2004-NMSC-030, 136 N.M. 309, 98 P.3d 699.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 13 Am. Jur. 2d Burglary § 27.\n\nWalking cane as deadly or dangerous weapon for purposes of statutes aggravating offenses such as assault and robbery, 8 A.L.R.4th 842.\n\nParts of the human body, other than feet, as deadly or dangerous weapons for purposes of statutes aggravating offenses such as assault and robbery, 8 A.L.R.4th 1268.\n\nWhat is \"building\" or \"house\" within burglary or breaking and entering statute, 68 A.L.R.4th 425.\n\nFact that gun was unloaded as affecting criminal responsibility, 68 A.L.R.4th 507.\n\nAdmissibility of expert opinion stating whether a particular knife was, or could have been, the weapon used in a crime, 83 A.L.R.4th 660.\n\n12A C.J.S.

      "text": "Possession of burglary tools consists of having in the person's possession a device or instrumentality designed or commonly used for the commission of burglary and under circumstances evincing an intent to use the same in the commission of burglary.\n\nWhoever commits possession of burglary tools is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-16-5, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 16-5.\n\nThis section is not void for vagueness,since it gives fair warning that possession of the type of instrument described in the statute, and under the circumstances described in the statute, is a crime.State v. Najera, 1976-NMCA-088, 89 N.M. 522, 554 P.2d 983.\n\nVagueness.— Since criminal intent is construed to be necessary element of crime of possession of burglary tools, act is not void for indefiniteness and uncertainty under constitution.State v. Lawson, 1955-NMSC-069, 59 N.M. 482, 286 P.2d 1076.\n\nNo unlawful delegation of power.— Since criminal intent is construed to be necessary element of crime of possession of burglary tools, act does not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the judiciary to prescribe in each case a different offense.State v. Lawson, 1955-NMSC-069, 59 N.M. 482, 286 P.2d 1076.\n\nNo merger with attempted burglary.— The crime of attempt to commit felony of burglary did not merge with the crime of possession of burglary tools, and hence, defendant's sentence for each of these crimes did not constitute double punishment.State v. Everitt, 1969-NMCA-010, 80 N.M. 41, 450 P.2d 927.\n\nPossession of burglary tools.— Possession of burglary tools is not necessarily involved in burglary.State v. Everitt, 1969-NMCA-010, 80 N.M. 41, 450 P.2d 927.\n\nWhat conduct prohibited.— This section gives notice that one is exposed to criminal sanctions if one: (1) possesses an instrumentality or device, (2) the instrumentality or device is designed or commonly used to commit burglary, and (3) the instrumentality or device is possessed under circumstances evincing an intent to use the instrumentality or device in committing burglary.State v. Najera, 1976-NMCA-088, 89 N.M. 522, 554 P.2d 983.\n\nPossession of a burglary tool is alone insufficient to satisfy the statutory element of intent to commit burglary.— Where defendant was charged with possession of burglary tools, and where, at trial, the arresting officer testified that defendant was found in possession of \"jiggle\" or \"bump\" keys, which the officer testified are filed down car keys which may be used as universal keys to start vehicles and which are designed for or commonly used in the commission of a burglary, there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for possession of burglary tools, because although defendant was found to be carrying a tool that has no legitimate purpose and is designed for burglary, proof of possession of a tool designed exclusively for use as a burglary tool is alone insufficient to satisfy the statutory element of intent to use that tool in the commission of a burglary.State v. Montoya, 2021-NMCA-006, cert. denied.\n\nWhether items commonly used for burglary is jury question.— The issue of whether items are commonly used for burglary is a factual one to be decided by the jury upon any competent evidence tending to show the nature and purpose of the tools.State v. Jennings, 1984-NMCA-051, 102 N.M. 89, 691 P.2d 882, cert. quashed, 102 N.M. 88, 691 P.2d 881.\n\nCriminal intent requisite.— Criminal intent is an element of crime of possession of burglary tools, and the phrase \"under circumstances evincing an intent\" is merely a directive that criminal intent may be shown by evidence of circumstances.State v. Lawson, 1955-NMSC-069, 59 N.M. 482, 286 P.2d 1076.\n\nNature of possession.— This section does not require possession of burglary tools on the person of the defendant.State v. Garcia, 1969-NMCA-039, 80 N.M. 247, 453 P.2d 767.\n\nIndictment sufficient.— Indictment charging offense by reference to the section or subsection creating the offense was sufficient, and trial court properly treated allegation as to possession on defendant's person as surplusage.State v. Garcia, 1969-NMCA-039, 80 N.M. 247, 453 P.2d 767.\n\nEvidence sufficient.— The evidence, which showed that defendant pried open an office door and committed a larceny, was sufficient to support a finding that defendant intended to use a pry device to make an unauthorized entry of a structure with the intent to commit a felony therein.State v. Barragan, 2001-NMCA-086, 131 N.M. 281, 34 P.3d 1157.\n\nEvidence of possession.— Evidence that burglary tools were taken by police from possession of defendants, weapons being found in the truck occupied by them on night of the burglary, substantially supported finding that defendants were in possession of the tools.State v. Garcia, 1969-NMCA-039, 80 N.M. 247, 453 P.2d 767.\n\nInsufficient evidence of possession of burglary tools.— Where defendant was convicted of possession of burglary tools, and where the state presented evidence that a police officer witnessed defendant driving a vehicle that had been reported stolen and that the officer observed a screwdriver in the center console, there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction, because there was no evidence that defendant had the screwdriver before he entered the vehicle or that he had any intent to use the screwdriver to obtain unauthorized entry to the vehicle.State v. Ford, 2019-NMCA-073.\n\nInsufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for possession of burglary tools.— Where defendant was convicted of non-residential burglary, breaking and entering, and possession of burglary tools, and where defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for possession of burglary tools, specifically contending that the state did not present sufficient evidence to show that the gloves or the screwdriver found in his possession were items designed for or commonly used to gain entry during a burglary, or that he intended to use the items for the purpose of committing a burglary, there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for possession of burglary tools, because although there was testimony that the arresting officer found a screwdriver wrapped inside a pair of gloves in defendant's pocket, the state presented no other evidence that could establish that defendant used or intended to use the screwdriver at the time of entry, or that a screwdriver is designed for, or commonly used in, the commission of a burglary, and although the state explained to the jury why defendant might wear gloves to commit the burglary, there was no evidence from which a rational juror could determine that defendant was wearing gloves at the time of entry.State v. Begaye, 2022-NMCA-010, 505 P.3d 855,rev'd by2023-NMSC-015.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Confusing Law of Criminal Intent in New Mexico,\" see 5 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. Fraud consists of the intentional misappropriation or taking of anything of value that belongs to another by means of fraudulent conduct, practices or representations.\n\nB. Whoever commits fraud when the value of the property misappropriated or taken is two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or less is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nC. Whoever commits fraud when the value of the property misappropriated or taken is over two hundred fifty dollars ($250) but not more than five hundred dollars ($500) is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nD. Whoever commits fraud when the value of the property misappropriated or taken is over five hundred dollars ($500) but not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nE. Whoever commits fraud when the value of the property misappropriated or taken is over two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) but not more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) is guilty of a third degree felony.\n\nF. Whoever commits fraud when the value of the property misappropriated or taken exceeds twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) is guilty of a second degree felony.\n\nG. Whoever commits fraud when the property misappropriated or taken is a firearm that is valued at less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-16-6, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 16-6; 1979, ch. 119, § 1; 1987, ch. 121, § 2; 2006, ch. 29, § 3.\n\nThe 2006 amendment,effective July 1, 2006, increased the value of property in Subsection B from $100 or less to $250 or less; increased the value of property in Subsection C from more than $100 but less than $250 to more than $250 but less than $500; increased the value of property in Subsection D from more than $250 but less than $500 to more than $500 but less than $2,500; deleted the former provision that whoever commits fraud when the property misappropriated or taken is a firearm is guilty of a fourth degree felony; and added Subsection G to provide that whoever commits fraud when the property misappropriated is a firearm with a value of less than $2,500 is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, added the third paragraph, substituted \"two hundred fifty dollars ($250) for \"one hundred dollars ($100)\" in the fourth paragraph, and substituted \"is over\" for \"exceeds\" in the sixth paragraph.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nSignificance of value.— The primary elements of fraud are an intentional misappropriation or taking of anything of value. Particular values are significant only for division of gravity from a petty misdemeanor ($100 or less) to a second degree felony (over $20,000).State v. Lee, 2009-NMCA-075, 146 N.M. 605, 213 P.3d 509, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-006, 146 N.M. 733, 215, P.3d 42.\n\nIntent.— Where the evidence supports a reasonable inference that defendant knew the representations he made were false, there is sufficient evidence of fraudulent intent.State v. Gardner, 1985-NMCA-084, 103 N.M. 320, 706 P.2d 862, cert. denied, 103 N.M. 287, 705 P.2d 1138.\n\nFraud and embezzlement are mutually exclusive,and although alternative charges are proper, a defendant cannot be convicted of both fraud and embezzlement.State v. Hornbeck, 2008-NMCA-039, 143 N.M. 562, 178 P.3d 847.\n\nSection inapplicable to judicial proceedings.— If presentation of a false claim were made to a board constituting a court, proceedings before which would result in a judicial judgment or decree, there could be no prosecution for obtaining money for false pretenses; the remedy would be a prosecution for perjury.State v. Kelly, 1921-NMSC-073, 27 N.M. 412, 202 P. 524.\n\nConviction under general law improper.— Where one who sold one neat cattle, the property of another, was prosecuted under former law relating to sale of property without right, the conviction could not stand, for law relating to larceny, embezzlement or killing of domestic animals, applied specifically to that crime and should have been invoked.State v. Blevins, 1936-NMSC-052, 40 N.M. 367, 60 P.2d 208.\n\nJurisdiction.— Jurisdiction of prosecution for criminal false pretenses was in the county, district or state where the offense was consummated by the obtaining of the property, even though the inducing pretenses were made elsewhere and the consummation by delivery of the property was effected through the instrumentality of an innocent agent, without the personal presence of the principal.State v. Faggard, 1918-NMSC-133, 25 N.M. 76, 177 P. 748 (decided under prior law).\n\nEffect of Worthless Check Act.— This section and the Worthless Check Act (30-36-1 to 30-36-9 NMSA 1978) prohibit different offenses, and it is inappropriate to view the Worthless Check Act as an exception to this section.State v. Higgins, 1988-NMCA-072, 107 N.M. 617, 762 P.2d 904.\n\nEffect of Veterans' Benefits Act.— Where defendant was indicted for fraudulently obtaining reimbursements for travel to and from medical appointments which were reimbursable by the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs pursuant to the Veterans' Benefits Act, 38 U.S.C. §111, the act did not preempt the state's prosecution of defendant for violation of Section 30-16-6 NMSA 1978 or create an unavoidable conflict with state law.State v. Herrera, 2014-NMCA-003, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-011.\n\nPlace of crime.— Fraud of which defendant was convicted occurred in New Mexico where defendant issued drafts of an insurance company drawn on a bank in Colorado in payment of false claims.State v. Archuleta, 1970-NMCA-131, 82 N.M. 378, 482 P.2d 242, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 377, 482 P.2d 241.\n\nConvictions violated double jeopardy.— Where defendant was charged with four counts of fraud and, in the alternative, four counts of embezzlement, and on counts 2 and 4, she was convicted of both the fraud and embezzlement alternatives, although the state is authorized to charge in the alternative, defendant's convictions for both alternatives violate her right to be free from double jeopardy.State v. Mercer, 2005-NMCA-023, 137 N.M. 36, 106 P.3d 1283, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-002, 137 N.M. 265, 110 P.3d 73.\n\nMultiple convictions of fraud violated defendant's double jeopardy rights.— Where defendant was charged with multiple counts of fraud and failure to disclose facts to obtain public assistance, related to her application for and receipt of several forms of public assistance benefits, including supplemental security income (SSI), social security disability insurance (SSDI), medicaid, and food stamps (SNAP), and where defendant claimed on appeal that her public assistance fraud convictions should be vacated because the conduct supporting those convictions was the same conduct supporting the general fraud convictions, defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated, because defendant's conduct supporting the fraud charges and the public assistance fraud charges was unitary, the general fraud was not complete before the public assistance fraud was committed, the time and space for each overlapped, the quality and nature of the acts were the same, the object and results of the acts were the same, and the mens rea for the general fraud and the public assistance fraud were the same, and, under the state's theory of the case, the public assistance fraud convictions were subsumed within the general fraud convictions. Punishment cannot be had for both fraud and public assistance fraud in this case.State v. DeLaO, 2022-NMCA-064, cert. denied.\n\nMistake of fact instruction not warranted.— Where defendant was charged with multiple counts of fraud and failure to disclose facts to obtain public assistance, related to her application for and receipt of several forms of public assistance benefits, including supplemental security income (SSI), social security disability insurance (SSDI), medicaid, and food stamps (SNAP), and where defendant claimed on appeal that the district court improperly refused to give a mistake of fact instruction based on defendant's theory that she mistakenly believed that by separately reporting her income to the human services department [health care authority department] to satisfy a child support obligation, she satisfied all of her reporting obligations, the district court properly denied defendant's requested instruction, because the general fraud instruction adequately apprised the jury of the intent element of the crime and allowed it to consider defendant's theory of the case.State v. DeLaO, 2022-NMCA-064, cert. denied.\n\nSubsequent prosecutions not double jeopardy.— Dismissal of charge of passing forged instrument evidencing an indebtedness of a banking institution with intent to defraud for variance between allegation and proof, in that the instrument in question did not evidence an indebtedness of a bank, and subsequent prosecution for passing same forged bill of exchange with intent to defraud under the appropriate section, did not constitute double jeopardy as one information required proof of facts which the other did not.Owens v. Abram, 1954-NMSC-096, 58 N.M. 682, 274 P.2d 630, cert. denied, 348 U.S. 917, 75 S. Ct. 300, 99 L. Ed. 719 (1955).\n\nNotice of lesser included offense.— Fraud over $250 is a lesser and necessarily included offense of fraud over $2,500, such that defendant was put on notice of the included offense when the state charged him with the greater offense.State v. Montoya, 1993-NMCA-097, 116 N.M. 297, 861 P.2d 978, cert. denied, 116 N.M. 364, 862 P.2d 1223.\n\nProsecution for both fraud and making false public voucher permitted.— The double jeopardy clause does not prohibit the prosecution of an individual under both this section and 30-23-3 NMSA 1978.State v. Ellenberger, 1981-NMSC-056, 96 N.M. 287, 629 P.2d 1216.\n\nBecause the fraud statute does not require the making of a false voucher, and the false-voucher statute does not require the misappropriation or taking of anything of value, and because fraud, unlike the crime of making false public vouchers, requires proof of the victim's reliance, defendant may be prosecuted and sentenced for violation of both statutes.State v. Whitaker, 1990-NMCA-014, 110 N.M. 486, 797 P.2d 275, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 631, 788 P.2d 931.\n\nAlternative charging of fraud or embezzlement.— The concept of double jeopardy was not involved in charging defendant with fraud or in the alternative embezzlement since the charges were in the alternative, nor were the concepts of included offenses, same evidence or merger applicable.State v. Ortiz, 1977-NMCA-036, 90 N.M. 319, 563 P.2d 113.\n\nFraud and fraudulent securities practice separate offenses.— An analysis of the offense of fraud and the crime of fraudulent securities practice reveals that the two offenses have different elements; therefore, a defendant may be convicted and sentenced for both general fraud and securities fraud.State v. Ross, 1986-NMCA-015, 104 N.M. 23, 715 P.2d 471;State v. Rivera, 2009-NMCA-132, 147 N.M. 406, 223 P.3d 951, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-011, 147 N.M. 463, 225 P.3d 793.\n\nConvictions under this section and 58-11-65 NMSA 1978 improper.— Conviction under this section for fraud over $2500 and conviction under 58-11-65 NMSA 1978 for false written statement for the purposes of obtaining credit union funds violated defendant's double jeopardy rights.State v. Montoya, 1993-NMCA-097, 116 N.M. 297, 861 P.2d 978, cert. denied, 116 N.M. 364, 862 P.2d 1223.\n\nProsecution for violation of civil statute.— The question of whether a specific contractual provision is based on a valid statute or regulation is irrelevant in a criminal case for fraud. The prosecution here was directed at the alleged criminal fraud of each of the defendants rather than a civil action to enforce the contract. Under these circumstances, defendants' convictions for fraud were not invalid.State v. Crews, 1989-NMCA-088, 110 N.M. 723, 799 P.2d 592, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 232, 784 P.2d 419.\n\nSingle larceny doctrine is inapplicable to fraud statute.State v. Boergadine, 2005-NMCA-028, 137 N.M. 92, 107 P.3d 532, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-003, 137 N.M. 290, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nII. ELEMENTS OF OFFENSE.\n\nOwnership of website.— Where an independent website designer created a website on the internet under contract with the defendant who was seeking to use the website for commercial purposes; the contract recognized the designer's legal ownership of the copyright to the web pages; the contract provided that upon payment to the designer, the defendant would receive a license to use the web pages; the contract never transferred any interest in the web page design or ownership of the web site to the defendant; in breach of the contract, the defendant never paid the designer; the defendant locked out the designer from access to the website by changing the password; the designer was the owner of the website and the defendant was properly convicted of criminal fraud by taking property that belonged to someone other than the defendant.State v. Kirby, 2007-NMSC-034, 141 N.M. 838, 161 P.3d 883.\n\nFraud is complete once misappropriation or taking occurs by means stated in statute.State v. Thoreen, 1978-NMCA-024, 91 N.M. 624, 578 P.2d 325, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 610, 577 P.2d 1256.\n\nCompletion of the act of fraud.— The act of fraud is complete at the time of the taking or misappropriation. Obtaining title is not necessary.State v. Higgins, 1988-NMCA-072, 107 N.M. 617, 762 P.2d 904.\n\nMeaning of false pretense.— A false pretense was such a fraudulent representation of an existing or past fact, by one who knew it not to be true, as was adapted to induce the person to whom it was made to part with something of value.State v. Tanner, 1917-NMSC-017, 22 N.M. 493, 164 P. 821.\n\nTo convict defendant of fraud, state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubtthat defendant, by any words or conduct, made a promise that she had no intention of keeping or misrepresented a fact to the victims, intending to deceive or cheat them, and, because of the promise or misrepresentation and the victim's reliance on it, defendant obtained money belonging to someone other than the defendant.State v. Mercer, 2005-NMCA-023, 137 N.M. 36, 106 P.3d 1283, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-002, 137 N.M. 265, 110 P.3d 73.\n\nIntent to cheat and defraud required.— To do an act fraudulently is to do it with intent to cheat and defraud; therefore, because an intent to cheat and defraud is required, this is a specific intent crime and the language of this section sets forth the requisite intent.State v. Dosier, 1975-NMCA-031, 88 N.M. 32, 536 P.2d 1088, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 28, 536 P.2d 1084.\n\nIntent to defraud essential element of crime.— Intent to cheat and defraud was an essential and constituent element of offense prescribed under Laws 1882, ch. 20, § 1 (40-21-3, 1953 Comp.) relating to obtaining property with intent to cheat or defraud.State v. Ferguson, 1952-NMSC-052, 56 N.M. 398, 244 P.2d 783.\n\nIntent to defraud provable by inferences.— An essential element of fraud or embezzlement is intent, which is seldom provable by direct testimony, and must be proved by the reasonable inferences shown by the evidence and the surrounding circumstances.State v. Ortiz, 1977-NMCA-036, 90 N.M. 319, 563 P.2d 113.\n\nIntent to defraud must exist at time of taking.— Contention of defendant, convicted of embezzlement under 30-16-8 NMSA 1978, that this section specifically applied to his case was without merit, where facts showed that he sold a motorcycle to complaining witness, who subsequently loaned it back to him, and thereafter although requested to do so defendant did not return the motorcycle but sold it to a third person, since there was no evidence of any fraudulent intent on the part of defendant when motorcycle was loaned to him by complaining witness.State v. Gregg, 1972-NMCA-001, 83 N.M. 397, 492 P.2d 1260, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 562, 494 P.2d 975.\n\nIntent to defraud inferred from actions.— Where the defendant conveyed an interest in real property which she knew she did not possess, it can be reasonably inferred that the defendant intended to make false representations and intended to misappropriate the victims' money.State v. Martinez, 1979-NMCA-104, 95 N.M. 795, 626 P.2d 1292.\n\nSeparate intent to defraud for each act.— The fact that defendant specifically requested three additional cash payments for different purposes, which he accompanied by various assurances and justifications, supports the jury's finding that on each occasion, he had a separate intent to defraud.State v. Boergadine, 2005-NMCA-028, 137 N.M. 92, 107 P.3d 532, cert denied, 2005-NMCERT-003, 137 N.M. 290, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nSilence may form basis for criminal misrepresentation,where the defendant has a legal duty to speak or where such silence is calculated to deceive.State v. Stettheimer, 1980-NMCA-023, 94 N.M. 149, 607 P.2d 1167.\n\nSufficient evidence of reliance on misrepresentation of fact.— In defendant's trial for fraud, where the jury was presented with evidence that defendant, by misrepresenting that she was the victim's girlfriend, induced the victim, an eighty year old man, to allow defendant access to his bank accounts and that he would not have allowed such access had he known either that she had married or that she never truly considered herself the victim's girlfriend, a jury could reasonably infer that the victim's willingness to allow defendant access to his accounts was grounded on the misrepresentation that she was his girlfriend, and therefore the jury's finding of reliance was supported by substantial evidence.State v. Garcia, 2016-NMSC-034,rev'g2015-NMCA-094, 356 P.3d 45.\n\nReliance on misrepresentation required.— A misrepresentation for purposes of criminal fraud may include a deceptive silence or omission. The state must also present evidence sufficient to prove that because of the victim's reliance on the misrepresentation, the defendant obtained the thing of value.State v. Garcia, 2015-NMCA-094, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nWhere defendant, a woman in her fifties, misrepresented her marital status to victim, a man in his mid-eighties, and convinced victim to provide her with access to victim's bank accounts, where defendant transferred funds from victim's accounts to defendant's own bank account for personal use, and where victim testified at trial that he allowed defendant access to his bank accounts because it would be easier for defendant to help him with his personal finances, that he wanted to help defendant out with her children and family, and that he was helping defendant out because he felt sorry for her, the evidence was insufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for fraud because the state failed to carry its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that victim relied on defendant's misrepresentation, that he would not have given defendant access to his bank accounts but for his impression that she was romantically available to him.State v. Garcia, 2015-NMCA-094, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nReliance necessary.— Under 40-21-1, 1953 Comp., relating to the obtaining of money under false pretenses, it was necessary that the prosecution establish that the victim relied on the false representation and surrendered her money to appellant on the strength of the false representation.State v. Jones, 1964-NMSC-028, 73 N.M. 459, 389 P.2d 398 (decided under prior law, statute repealed).\n\nActual damage to victim is not element of fraud.— Although damages are essential to recover on a civil claim for fraud, monetary loss is not a requisite of a criminal conviction.State v. McCall, 1984-NMSC-007, 101 N.M. 32, 677 P.2d 1068,rev'g1983-NMCA-109, 101 N.M. 616, 686 P.2d 958.\n\nPecuniary loss by victim unnecessary.— A criminal conviction for fraud does not require the victim suffer a pecuniary loss. Sufficient evidence was presented at trial of an intentional misappropriation or taking of something of value belonging to another by means of fraudulent conduct, practices or representations. Thus, the jury could have reasonably inferred defendants intentionally misappropriated funds invested by their partners and these funds were received due to misrepresentations.State v. Clifford, 1994-NMSC-048, 117 N.M. 508, 873 P.2d 254.\n\nMaking false claim through agent.— Evidence that bank was instructed by defendant to submit items for payment established relation of principal and agent, and submission of bond for consideration and refunding necessarily constituted the false representation as to its legality and validity.State v. Kelly, 1921-NMSC-073, 27 N.M. 412, 202 P. 524.\n\nRepayment will not mitigate completed offense.— Once a misappropriation or taking occurs by means stated in this section, the crime of fraud is complete, and repayment will not mitigate the offense.State v. Schifani, 1978-NMCA-080, 92 N.M. 127, 584 P.2d 174, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324.\n\nIII. INDICTMENT AND INFORMATION.\n\nJoinder appropriate.— Where the 12 counts of fraud charged were in the execution of a general fraudulent scheme, extending from September 1968 to January 1969, the method of operation in each count was identical and in each instance it was the property of the same insurance company that was misappropriated or taken, the trial court's refusal to sever was proper.State v. Archuleta, 1970-NMCA-131, 82 N.M. 378, 482 P.2d 242, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 377, 482 P.2d 241 (1971).\n\nSeverance properly denied.— The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to sever counts of fraud and receiving a bribe from other counts where there was no evidence the multiplicity of charges confused the jury, the multiplicity of charges were not cumulative, and the counts were predicate offenses for a racketeering charge.State v. Armijo, 1997-NMCA-080, 123 N.M. 690, 944 P.2d 919.\n\nAlternative charging permissible.— There was nothing unfair about charging the defendant in the alternative with fraud or embezzlement, particularly since the charges arose out of the same events and carried the same penalties, and defendant was furnished with a most detailed statement of fact including the complete district attorney's file, police reports and a citation of authorities the state was relying on in support of each of the alternative charges.State v. Ortiz, 1977-NMCA-036, 90 N.M. 319, 563 P.2d 113.\n\nAllegation of ownership.— Indictment for false pretenses was to allege ownership of the property, unless there was some legal excuse for omitting such allegation.State v. Faggard, 1918-NMSC-133, 25 N.M. 76, 177 P. 748;Territory v. Hubbell, 1906-NMSC-033, 13 N.M. 579, 86 P. 747.\n\nDegree of crime measured by value of property obtained.— The degree of crime under this section must be measured by the value of the property obtained by the defendant as a result of the deception, rather than the value of any property received by the victim.State v. Martinez, 1979-NMCA-104, 95 N.M. 795, 626 P.2d 1292.\n\nInformation adequate.— Amended information charging defendant with unlawfully obtaining money under false pretenses with intent to defraud, which enumerated the section defining the offense and fixing the penalty, was sufficient.State v. Jones, 1964-NMSC-028, 73 N.M. 459, 389 P.2d 398.\n\nDefective indictment.— An indictment for securing money by false pretense was fatally defective where it was alleged that the means employed were certain bogus bills of sale and a mortgage attached to a draft drawn on the defrauded party, but which failed to allege that draft was ever honored by such party, and money paid by such party on the faith of such representation.State v. Faggard, 1918-NMSC-133, 25 N.M. 76, 177 P. 748.\n\nInformation fatally defective.— Failure to allege intent to cheat and defraud in information charging accused with obtaining money by false representations rendered the information fatally defective and any judgment based thereon became a nullity.State v. Ferguson, 1952-NMSC-052, 56 N.M. 398, 244 P.2d 783.\n\nVariance not material.— Even if there was a variance between amended information charging defendant with having obtained $500 from named individual, while the proof showed that the $500 check was drawn on the laundry and cleaner's account and signed by the named individual, one of the owners of the laundry, the variance if any was not such as would impair the substantial rights of defendant.State v. Jones, 1964-NMSC-028, 73 N.M. 459, 389 P.2d 398.\n\nIV. EVIDENCE.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nRelated incidents admissible.— In the case of fraud, related incidents of accused's acts are admissible to establish motive, absence of mistake or accident, common scheme or plan or the identity of the person charged with various crimes.State v. McCallum, 1975-NMCA-030, 87 N.M. 459, 535 P.2d 1085, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 457, 535 P.2d 1083.\n\nOther acts evidencing intent.— The fact that defendant entered into many contracts which he failed to complete showed that either he was aware of the risks, that he was aware of his capabilities or that he could not have believed that he would complete the contracts, and so his proceeding to contract in spite of his awareness was evidence of his fraudulent intent.State v. McCallum, 1975-NMCA-030, 87 N.M. 459, 535 P.2d 1085, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 457, 535 P.2d 1083.\n\nRepayment will not mitigate completed offense.— Repayment of a loan obtained by fraud so that the lender suffered no damages is not a defense against a charge of fraud under this section.State v. McCall, 1984-NMSC-007, 101 N.M. 32, 677 P.2d 1068,rev'g1983-NMCA-109, 101 N.M. 616, 686 P.2d 958.\n\nFailure to return money.— Testimony showing a nonreturn of the money was proper to show the intent of defendant, charged with obtaining money under false pretenses.State v. Jones, 1964-NMSC-028, 73 N.M. 459, 389 P.2d 398.\n\nProof of false pretenses.— False pretense could be established by conduct and acts as well as by written or spoken words.State v. Kelly, 1921-NMSC-073, 27 N.M. 412, 202 P. 524.\n\nConfession alone inadequate proof.— Proof that a crime of fraud was committed cannot be established solely by the extrajudicial confession of the accused.State v. Dosier, 1975-NMCA-031, 88 N.M. 32, 536 P.2d 1088, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 28, 536 P.2d 1084.\n\nImputation of guilty knowledge.— Guilty knowledge of a brother of one accused of selling property belonging to another was not imputable to defendant.State v. Hughes, 1938-NMSC-077, 43 N.M. 109, 86 P.2d 278.\n\nWhen directed verdict appropriate.— Only where there are no reasonable inferences or sufficient surrounding circumstances establishing defendant's intent can it be said, as a matter of law, that a motion for a directed verdict should have been granted or that a charge should not have been presented to the jury.State v. Ortiz, 1977-NMCA-036, 90 N.M. 319, 563 P.2d 113.\n\nQuestion for jury.— It was for the jury to decide whether defendant obtained the $500 by fraud or converted to his own use the money with which he had been entrusted.State v. Ortiz, 1977-NMCA-036, 90 N.M. 319, 563 P.2d 113.\n\nWhether defendant received property as loan or for investment jury question.— In a trial for fraud and embezzlement where the evidence was conflicting, whether the money and checks given to the defendant were loans, as he claimed, or were for investments, as his alleged victims claimed, was for the jury to decide.State v. Schifani, 1978-NMCA-080, 92 N.M. 127, 584 P.2d 174, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324.\n\nSubsequent representations admissible to show intent.— Evidence of representations made to the victims after the defendant had obtained their money, which went into specific details of alleged investments, was properly admitted in defendant's trial for fraud since the evidence explained his \"investment\" representations and tended to show his intent.State v. Schifani, 1978-NMCA-080, 92 N.M. 127, 584 P.2d 174, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where defendant refinanced the marital home without the knowledge or consent of defendant's spouse for $32,635, there was sufficient evidence that the amount of the fraud was greater than $20,000, notwithstanding defendant's argument that because the home was community property, half of the loan proceeds belonged to defendant.State v. Turner, 2007-NMCA-105, 142 N.M. 460, 166 P.3d 1114, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-008, 142 N.M. 434, 166 P.3d 1088.\n\nWhere defendant presented a check for cashing at a store; the check was made payable to defendant in an amount that exceeded $250; the check was drawn on the victim's business account for labor; and the victim testified that the victim had not employed defendant or written a check to defendant in payment for labor, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for fraud.State v. Caldwell, 2008-NMCA-049, 143 N.M. 792, 182 P.3d 775, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-003, 143 N.M. 681, 180 P.3d 1180.\n\nEvidence sufficient to convict.— Testimony of a witness which is not inherently improbable because of a physical impossibility that the statements are true or the falsity of the statement is apparent without resort to inferences or deductions is sufficient to convict.State v. Sanders, 1994-NMSC-043, 117 N.M. 452, 872 P.2d 870.\n\nEvidence is sufficient when elements of offense are established beyond a reasonable doubt by direct or circumstantial evidence. Fraudulent intent may be inferred from defendant's conduct and words.;State v. Armijo, 1997-NMCA-080, 123 N.M. 690, 944 P.2d 919.\n\nSeparate convictions for each act.— Where defendant first took a $350 check from the customer on February 11, 2002, and six days later, on February 17, 2002, customer gave defendant $300 in cash and two months later, on April 16, 2002, defendant requested more money from customer and on April 18, 2002, defendant received another $1,200 in cash, each time the defendant took money from the customer for repair of her car's transmission, he had not done any work on her car. Therefore, the lengthy stretches of time between these acts and the individual false requests for additional sums of money for parts supports three separate convictions for defendant's acts.State v. Boergadine, 2005-NMCA-028, 137 N.M. 92, 107 P.3d 532, cert denied, 2005-NMCERT-003, 137 N.M. 290, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nB. SUFFICIENCY.\n\nChild support payments.— Where defendant's words and conduct included his claim that he had already tendered child support payments to his ex-wife and his offer of the photocopied non-carbon records to his ex-wife's attorney to bolster that claim, the intent was to evade payment of the amount he owed. The fact that he did not succeed results only in the lessening of the conviction to attempted fraud. It does not show an absence of an intent to defraud.State v. Cearley, 2004-NMCA-079, 135 N.M. 710, 92 P.3d 1284, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-003, 137 N.M. 290, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nMisappropriation of drafts.— A charge of misappropriation of money may be established by showing that drafts or checks were misappropriated.State v. Archuleta, 1970-NMCA-131, 82 N.M. 378, 482 P.2d 242, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 377, 482 P.2d 241.\n\nFalse accounts.— Where defendant made out false accounts in the name of a plumber for work purportedly done on plumbing system of courthouse and submitted them to board of county commissioners, knowing that the work had not been done and securing the proceeds for himself, evidence was sufficient to support conviction of obtaining money under false pretenses.State v. Garcia, 1953-NMSC-026, 57 N.M. 166, 256 P.2d 532.\n\nProof of value.— The defendant, who had opened an account, deposited a check he knew was not backed by sufficient funds, and wrote a number of checks, some of which were accepted by local businesses in exchange for merchandise, was improperly convicted of fraud. There was no testimony establishing the \"false balance\" ever had the values on which the jury was instructed. Proof of value is critical in a fraud prosecution.State v. Higgins, 1988-NMCA-072, 107 N.M. 617, 762 P.2d 904.\n\nLoan.— There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of fraud; the evidence showed that defendant borrowed money from the victim after giving the victim a check in repayment of a previous debt, that the check was returned for insufficient funds, and that the borrowed money was not used for defendant's stated purpose.State v. Curry, 2002-NMCA-092, 132 N.M. 602, 52 P.3d 974, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 397, 49 P.3d 76.\n\nSpurious claim to loan board.— False pretense could be predicated upon spurious claim presented to board of loan commissioners established to refund, pursuant to provision of Enabling Act, debts and obligations of the territory and its counties into state bonds.State v. Kelly, 1921-NMSC-073, 27 N.M. 412, 202 P. 524.\n\nObtaining automobile through fraud.— Evidence substantially supported a finding that defendant obtained an automobile from victim motor company by means of fraudulent conduct, practices or representations which were relied on by the company.State v. McKay, 1969-NMCA-009, 79 N.M. 797, 450 P.2d 435.\n\nVictims' inability to specify alleged investment no help to defendant.— The fact that the victims did not know the type of investment their money was to be put into did not aid the defendant because the evidence showed that he had obtained the money by fraudulently representing that it would be invested.State v. Schifani, 1978-NMCA-080, 92 N.M. 127, 584 P.2d 174, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324.\n\nFraudulent construction contract.— Evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to support the verdict, showing that the defendant entered into a contract with fraud victim to do certain construction work, which was not done, and that defendant even gave the victim a promissory note, evidencing an indebtedness, which was never paid, taken together with the evidence of other similar transactions, constituted substantial evidence to convict him of fraud.State v. McCallum, 1975-NMCA-030, 87 N.M. 459, 535 P.2d 1085, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 457, 535 P.2d 1083.\n\nDefrauding noninnocent victim.— One could be convicted of obtaining money by false representations whose part in a fraudulent scheme was to sell cases of cotton, which were represented to be cigarettes, to a victim, although the victim understood he was helping to defraud either owners or insurers.State v. Foster, 1934-NMSC-083, 38 N.M. 540, 37 P.2d 541.\n\nFraudulent obtainment of loanmay be basis for conviction of criminal fraud.State v. Stettheimer, 1980-NMCA-023, 94 N.M. 149, 607 P.2d 1167.\n\nFraudulent land development project.— Where defendants were charged with fraud after convincing an elderly couple to invest in a fraudulent investment scheme, evidence that defendants received over $78,000 from the victims for the purpose of investing in a land development project, that the money was instead placed in a bank account in defendants' names, that the money was disbursed by defendants for their personal benefit, and that the land project was never completed, was sufficient to show that defendants misrepresented facts to the victims, intending to deceive or cheat them, and that because of the victims' reliance on defendants' misrepresentations, defendants obtained more than $20,000.State v. Maxwell, 2016-NMCA-082, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of securities fraud.— Where defendants were charged with securities fraud after convincing an elderly couple to invest in a phony real estate investment project, evidence that defendants received $270,000 from the victims for the purpose of investing in a land development project and over $50,000 for the purpose of investing in commodities, that the money was instead placed in accounts solely owned by defendants, that the money was disbursed by defendants for their personal benefit, and that the money was never invested in the real estate project or in commodities, was sufficient to show that defendants sold or offered to sell a security and that in connection with the offer or sale of the security, defendants purposefully used a plan or scheme to deceive or cheat the victims. State v. Maxwell, 2016-NMCA-082, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for fraud.— Where defendant was convicted of one count of fraud over $20,000, one count of conspiracy to commit fraud over $20,000, one count of securities fraud, one count of sale of a security by an unlicensed agent and one count of offer or sale of an unregistered security, and where defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support his fraud conviction, there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction where the state presented evidence that defendant misrepresented his own personal investment in the company, misrepresented the minimum investment requirement, omitted the fact that he would be paid upon the victims' investment, and misrepresented how the investment money was used. These facts support the jurors' reasonable inference that defendant intended to deceive the victims with his misrepresentations and omissions. Additionally, the state presented evidence that the victims would not have made a $25,000 investment if they were aware that defendant misrepresented the amount that he personally invested or that he would be paid based upon their investment.State v. Hixon, 2023-NMCA-048, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence to support conspiracy to commit securities fraud.— There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for conspiracy to commit fraud over $20,000 where the state presented evidence of repeated dealings between defendant and his co-defendant where defendant knew that he would be paid from people's investments, that defendant encouraged friends and family to invest in the internet programming company, that defendant introduced several victims to his co-defendant, that defendant misrepresented and omitted relevant information regarding his own investments in the company and the financial benefits he received from inducing others to invest in the company, and that the investments were not used for the purpose defendant indicated when inducing the investments. The record shows sufficient evidence to establish a mutually implied understanding between defendant and his co-defendant.State v. Hixon, 2023-NMCA-048, cert. denied.\n\nEvidence sufficient to sustain conviction of attempted fraud.State v. Olguin, 1994-NMCA-050, 118 N.M. 91, 879 P.2d 92,aff'd in part, 1995-NMSC-077, 120 N.M. 740, 906 P.2d 731.\n\nV. INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nDefinition of fraudulent conduct unnecessary.— Absent a clearly expressed legislative intent requiring otherwise, fraudulent conduct is to be given its usual, ordinary meaning, and hence, there was no jurisdictional error in failing to define fraudulent conduct in an instruction; if defendant desired the term to be defined, he should have submitted a requested instruction.State v. Dosier, 1975-NMCA-031, 88 N.M. 32, 536 P.2d 1088, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 28, 536 P.2d 1084.\n\nInstruction on victim's intelligence not required.— According to the majority view, statutes covering the crime of obtaining money under false pretenses were designed to protect not only the ordinarily wary and prudent, but also the ignorant, credulous and foolish; hence, trial court did not err in refusing to grant defendant's instruction to the effect that the jury had a right to consider the intelligence of the prosecuting witnesses.State v. Jones, 1964-NMSC-028, 73 N.M. 459, 389 P.2d 398.\n\nInstruction on gambling properly denied.— Requested instruction that if victim was gambling the defendants must be found not guilty of fraud was properly denied as this section does not exempt fraud perpetrated while gambling.State v. Dosier, 1975-NMCA-031, 88 N.M. 32, 536 P.2d 1088, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 28, 536 P.2d 1084.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Confusing Law of Criminal Intent in New Mexico,\" see 5 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. Unlawful dealing in federal food coupons or WIC checks consists of a person buying, selling, trading, bartering or possessing food coupons or WIC checks issued by the United States department of agriculture with the intent to obtain an economic benefit to which the person is not entitled under the rules of the human services department [health care authority department] pertaining to the food stamp program or of the department of health pertaining to the special supplemental food program for women, infants and children.\n\nB. Whoever commits unlawful dealing in federal food coupons or WIC checks when the value of the food coupons or WIC checks involved is two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or less is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nC. Whoever commits unlawful dealing in federal food coupons or WIC checks when the value of the food coupons or WIC checks involved is over two hundred fifty dollars ($250) but not more than five hundred dollars ($500) is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nD. Whoever commits unlawful dealing in federal food coupons or WIC checks when the value of the food coupons or WIC checks involved is over five hundred dollars ($500) but not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nE.

Whoever commits unlawful dealing in federal food coupons or WIC checks when the value of the food coupons or WIC checks involved exceeds twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) is guilty of a second degree felony.\n\nG. For the purposes of this section, \"federal food coupons or WIC checks\" includes electronic benefit transfer cards or any other method through which food stamps or WIC benefits may be obtained.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-16-6.1, enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 282, § 1; 1987, ch. 121, § 3; 2003, ch. 251, § 1; 2006, ch. 29, § 4.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law. Laws 2023, ch. 205, § 16 provided that references to the human services department shall be deemed to be references to the health care authority department.\n\nThe 2006 amendment,effective July 1, 2006, increased the value of food coupons or WIC checks in Subsection B from $100 or less to $250 or less; increased the value of food coupons or WIC checks in Subsection C from more than $100 but less that $250 to more than $250 but less than $500; increased the value of food coupons or WIC checks in Subsection D from more than $250 to more than $500.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003 added the present Subsection A through F designations; in present Subsection A deleted \"and regulations\" following \"under the rules\" near the middle, substituted \"department of health\" for \"health and environment department\" following \"food stamp program or of the\" near the end; substituted \"two thousand five\" for \"twenty-five\" preceding \"hundred dollars\" near the end of present Subsection D; substituted \"two\" for \"twenty-five\" preceding \"thousand five hundred\" near the middle of present Subsection E; and added Subsection G.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, added \"or WIC checks\" following \"coupons\" in several places throughout the section, substituted all of the language in the first paragraph following \"regulations\" for \"of the health and social services department pertaining to the food stamp program,\" added the third and last paragraphs, substituted \"two hundred fifty dollars ($250)\" for \"one hundred dollars ($100)\" in the fourth paragraph, and substituted \"is over twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500) but not more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000)\" for \"exceeds twenty-five hundred ($2,500)\" in the fifth paragraph.\n\nSingle intent crime.The single intent crime doctrine applies to the crime of unlawful dealing in food coupons.State v. Johnson, 1996-NMCA-017, 121 N.M. 337, 911 P.2d 231, cert. denied 121 N.M. 242, 910 P.2d 318.\n\nEvidence sufficient for conviction.— Evidence that the defendant purchased four booklets of food stamps, each booklet with a face value of $65, on two separate occasions, was sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer the coupons had a value in excess of $250 and was sufficient for conviction.State v. Buendia, 1996-NMCA-027, 121 N.M. 408, 912 P.2d 284.",

Embezzlement consists of a person embezzling or converting to the person's own use anything of value, with which the person has been entrusted, with fraudulent intent to deprive the owner thereof.\n\nB. Whoever commits embezzlement when the value of the thing embezzled or converted is two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or less is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nC.

IN GENERAL.\n\nEquitable owner of property.— The equitable owner of property under a real estate contract cannot be criminally charged with embezzling that property.State v. Earp, 2014-NMCA-059.\n\nWhere defendant purchased a home pursuant to a real estate contract; when defendant failed to pay the balance due on the contract, the seller terminated the contract; prior to vacating the property, defendant removed a number of appliances and fixtures from the house and left the house in a state of disrepair; and defendant was charged with embezzlement, 30-16-8 NMSA 1978 did not apply to property in which defendant had an equitable ownership interest.State v. Earp, 2014-NMCA-059.\n\nJury deliberatons.— The trial court did not abuse its discretion in acquiescing to the jury's request for the use of a calculator during its deliberations in a trial for 148 counts of embezzlement.State v. Lihosit, 2002-NMCA-006, 131 N.M. 426, 38 P.3d 194, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 564, 40 P.3d 1008.\n\nEntrustment.— In order to be guilty of embezzlement, a defendant must have been entrusted with lawful possession of the property prior to its conversion. A showing that a defendant was given mere access to the property converted is insufficient.State v. Kovach, 2006-NMCA-122, 140 N.M. 430, 143 P.3d 192.\n\nElements of offense.— The concept that the property belong to someone other than the defendant is implicit in the current statute.State v. Cramer, 1977-NMCA-010, 90 N.M. 157, 560 P.2d 948, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 254, 561 P.2d 1347.\n\nFailure to instruct the jury on an essential element of embezzlement , fraudulent intent, is reversible error under Rule 5-608A NMRA.State v. Clifford, 1994-NMSC-048, 117 N.M. 508, 873 P.2d 254.\n\nFraud and embezzlement are mutually exclusive,and although alternative charges are proper, a defendant cannot be convicted of both fraud and embezzlement.State v. Hornbeck, 2008-NMCA-039, 143 N.M. 562, 178 P.3d 847.\n\nOffense of embezzlement is purely statutory crimeand does not exist at common law.State v. Bryant, 1982-NMCA-178, 99 N.M. 149, 655 P.2d 161.\n\nConviction as bar to further prosecution.— A conviction for embezzling a sum as county clerk and ex-officio clerk of the district court barred further prosecution for embezzling another sum as county clerk and ex-officio probate clerk where state was unable to show conversion of any particular sum at any particular time.State v. Romero, 1928-NMSC-023, 33 N.M. 314, 267 P. 66.\n\nConvictions violated double jeopardy.— Where defendant was charged with four counts of fraud and, in the alternative, four counts of embezzlement, and on counts 2 and 4, she was convicted of both the fraud and embezzlement alternatives, although the state is authorized to charge in the alternative, defendant's convictions for both alternatives violate her right to be free from double jeopardy.State v. Mercer, 2005-NMCA-023, 137 N.M. 36, 106 P.3d 1283, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-002, 137 N.M. 265, 110 P.3d 73.\n\nExercise of police power.— Section 40-45-22, 1953 Comp., relating to embezzlement by public officials of public funds, was a proper exercise of the police power.State v. Nolan, 1955-NMSC-059, 59 N.M. 437, 285 P.2d 798 (decided under prior law, statute repealed).\n\nPurpose of legislation.— The state's legitimate interest in the protection of public funds may be expressed in penal sanctions the purpose of which is the prevention of certain manifest or anticipated evil, or the preservation of the public health, safety, morals or general welfare.State v. Nolan, 1955-NMSC-059, 59 N.M. 437, 285 P.2d 798.\n\nPresumption of embezzlement constitutional.— Provision in former law making existence of a shortage in the money or property for which public officials were accountable prima facie evidence of embezzlement did not violate constitutional rights of accused as there was a rational connection between the facts and the fact presumed, and the defendant was not precluded from presenting his defense to the presumed fact.State v. Chavez, 1954-NMSC-114, 58 N.M. 802, 277 P.2d 302 (decided under prior law).\n\nDefendant can be convicted of third-degree felony where series of takings totals more than $2,500,although each individual taking is less, if the takings are associated with a single, sustained criminal intent.State v. Pedroncelli, 1984-NMSC-009, 100 N.M. 678, 675 P.2d 127.\n\nChild attempting to honor probation commitments.— If in refusing to purchase marijuana with money entrusted to him by a law enforcement officer, but instead keeping the money for himself, a child on probation was attempting to honor his probation commitments, affirming an order revoking probation based on charges of embezzlement would be inconsistent with the purposes of the Children's Code (Section 32A-1-1 NMSA 1978], since the child had not been aware that the person giving him the money was an undercover officer involved in a sting operation.In re Danny R., 1992-NMCA-056, 114 N.M. 315, 838 P.2d 469, cert. denied, 114 N.M. 123, 835 P.2d 839.\n\nII. ELEMENTS OF OFFENSE.\n\nConversion.— Conversion occurs when a person who has been entrusted with another's property treats the property as his own and uses it for his own purpose.State v. Curry, 2002-NMCA-092, 132 N.M. 602, 52 P.3d 974, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 397, 49 P.3d 76.\n\nTo convict of embezzlement, state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubtthat defendant was entrusted with money that she converted to her own use and, at the time defendant converted the money, she fraudulently intended to deprive the owner of it.State v. Mercer, 2005-NMCA-023, 137 N.M. 36, 106 P.3d 1283, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-002, 137 N.M. 265, 110 P.3d 73.\n\nEssential element of fraud or embezzlement is intent,which is seldom provable by direct testimony, and must be proved by the reasonable inferences shown by the evidence and the surrounding circumstances.State v. Ortiz, 1977-NMCA-036, 90 N.M. 319, 563 P.2d 113.\n\nEmbezzlement requires proof that defendant entertained specific intent to deprive owner of property.— Embezzlement is a crime which requires proof that at the time of the conversion of the property, the defendant entertained a specific intent to deprive the owner of the property.State v. Gonzales, 1983-NMCA-041, 99 N.M. 734, 663 P.2d 710, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 644, 662 P.2d 645, and cert. denied, 464 U.S. 855, 104 S. Ct. 173, 78 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1983).\n\n\"Entrust\" defined.— \"Entrust\" means to commit or surrender to another with a certain confidence regarding his care, use or disposal of that which has been committed or surrendered.State v. Stahl, 1979-NMCA-054, 93 N.M. 62, 596 P.2d 275, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 8, 595 P.2d 1203.\n\nSpecific or technical fiduciary relationship is not necessaryto sustain an embezzlement conviction.State v. Archie, 1997-NMCA-058, 123 N.M. 503, 943 P.2d 537.\n\nIntent to \"permanently\" depriveis not requisite element of embezzlement.State v. Moss, 1971-NMCA-117, 83 N.M. 42, 487 P.2d 1347.\n\nA legislative intent to include the element of intent to permanently deprive the owner of his property in the crime of embezzlement cannot be ascertained by comparing this section with the larceny statute (30-16-1 NMSA 1978), because larceny is defined in terms of stealing while comparable language is not used in the embezzlement statute.State v. Moss, 1971-NMCA-117, 83 N.M. 42, 487 P.2d 1347.\n\nTime of formation of intent.— It would not be fatal to conviction, resting on entrustment, that the fraudulent intent existed or was formed coincidentally with receipt of the money or property.State v. Konviser, 1953-NMSC-057, 57 N.M. 418, 259 P.2d 785.\n\nPersons capable of entrustment.— That one is an agent, servant or employee does not deny that \"entrustment\" may characterize the custody of money or property in his possession as such agent, servant or employee.State v. Konviser, 1953-NMSC-057, 57 N.M. 418, 259 P.2d 785.\n\nMoney to be proved missing.— If money cannot be proved missing by reliable, competent testimony or documentary evidence, an embezzlement charge must be dropped.State v. Konviser, 1953-NMSC-057, 57 N.M. 418, 259 P.2d 785.\n\nCourt trying embezzlement not concerned with amount owed victims.— In a trial for embezzlement, the court is not concerned with the amount owed to the victims by the defendant but with the amount converted in violation of this section.State v. Schifani, 1978-NMCA-080, 92 N.M. 127, 584 P.2d 174, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324.\n\nFailure to pay on demand.— Proof of a demand and a failure to return the property may be evidence of embezzlement because such proof is material to the questions of conversion of the property and a fraudulent intent to deprive the owner of his property, but such a demand and failure to return is not a separate element of the crime.State v. Moss, 1971-NMCA-117, 83 N.M. 42, 487 P.2d 1347.\n\nA demand and failure to pay over the money was necessary, both by way of allegation and proof, before a public official could be convicted of embezzlement under Code 1915, § 1546.State v. Davisson, 1923-NMSC-045, 28 N.M. 653, 217 P. 240, appeal dismissed, 267 U.S. 574, 45 S. Ct. 229, 69 L. Ed. 795 (1925) (decided under prior law).\n\nRestitution does not prevent conviction for completed embezzlement.— Embezzlement is complete when the defendant converts the victim's checks, and restitution does not allow the embezzler to escape prosecution and conviction.State v. Schifani, 1978-NMCA-080, 92 N.M. 127, 584 P.2d 174, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324.\n\nValue not jurisdictional.— Although information should have alleged value, jurisdiction does not depend upon the value of the property embezzled; value merely denotes the grade of the offense.Roehm v. Woodruff, 1958-NMSC-083, 64 N.M. 278, 327 P.2d 339(decided under prior law).\n\nIII. INDICTMENT AND INFORMATION.\n\nGrand jury instructions must include definitions.— The definitional instructions that are included within the essential UJI elements instruction for a crime shall be given to the grand jury.State v. Bradford, 2013-NMCA-071, 305 P.3d 975.\n\nFailure to give definitional instructions to grand jury.— Where defendant was charged with embezzlement and the instructions to the grand jury failed to include the definitions of \"fraudulent intent\" and \"converted\" in UJI 14-1641 NMRA, the jury instructions were insufficient.State v. Bradford, 2013-NMCA-071, 305 P.3d 975.\n\nCharging in alternative not double jeopardy.— The concept of double jeopardy was not involved in charging defendant with fraud or in the alternative embezzlement since the charges were in the alternative, nor were the concepts of included offenses, same evidence or merger applicable.State v. Ortiz, 1977-NMCA-036, 90 N.M. 319, 563 P.2d 113.\n\nCharging in alternative not unfair.— There was nothing unfair about charging the defendant in the alternative with fraud or embezzlement, particularly since the charges arose out of the same events and carried the same penalties, and defendant was furnished with a most detailed statement of fact including the complete district attorney's file, police reports and a citation of authorities the state was relying on in support of each of the alternative charges.State v. Ortiz, 1977-NMCA-036, 90 N.M. 319, 563 P.2d 113.\n\nIndictment proper although lesser offense also applicable.— Where there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction for embezzlement, prosecution therefor was proper, even though the charges might have been covered by the lesser crime of criminal damage to property.State v. Archie, 1997-NMCA-058, 123 N.M. 503, 943 P.2d 537.\n\nIndictment in exact language of statute was sufficiently specificto require no amplification.State v. Probert, 1914-NMSC-025, 19 N.M. 13, 140 P. 1108.\n\nMeans or elements of offense.— There is no necessity to set forth means or elements of the statutory offense of embezzlement in an information.Smith v. Abram, 1954-NMSC-061, 58 N.M. 404, 271 P.2d 1010.\n\nFailure to meet demands.— Indictment was to charge that accused was not able to meet the demands of any person lawfully demanding the allegedly embezzled property.Territory v. Abeyta, 1907-NMSC-011, 14 N.M. 56, 89 P. 254.\n\nAllegation of value.— Where indictment described embezzlement as being of a certain number of dollars, it was not necessary to state further the value.Territory v. Hale, 1905-NMSC-021, 13 N.M. 181, 81 P. 583 (decided under prior law).\n\nIndictment was sufficient both as to description of money and value thereof where it alleged \"having then and there in his possession the sum of . . . (a certain number of dollars), a better description of the kinds and character of which is to the grand jurors unknown.\"Territory v. Hale, 1905-NMSC-021, 13 N.M. 181, 81 P. 583 (decided under prior law).\n\nSince much property embezzled was never seen by the employer, it was not necessary to exactly describe it in indictment, and money need only have been described in the best way which the circumstances permitted, in the indictment and on trial.Territory v. Maxwell, 1882-NMSC-010, 2 N.M. 250 (decided under prior law).\n\nAllegation of ownership.— In indictment charging embezzlement it is essential to aver the felonious conversion of the property of another; unless the rule is modified by statute, the allegation must be as accurate as in an indictment for larceny, and in case of an association, facts must be averred to show that the association could own property in its name.State v. Parsons, 1917-NMSC-084, 23 N.M. 520, 169 P. 475 (decided under prior law).\n\nEmbezzlement by employee.— An indictment under Code 1915, § 1544, which did not allege that property embezzled came into possession of accused by virtue of his employment was not fatally defective.State v. Hill, 1918-NMSC-046, 24 N.M. 344, 171 P. 790 (decided under prior law).\n\nEmbezzlement of sheep.— An indictment under Laws 1921, ch. 123, § 1 (40-4-17, 1953 Comp.), alleging that on a day certain the defendant, having been entrusted with certain number of sheep belonging to named person, embezzled and fraudulently converted the same to his own use, stated an offense.State v. Anaya, 1922-NMSC-059, 28 N.M. 283, 210 P. 567 (decided under prior law).\n\nCitation of wrong section.— Petitioner was not deprived of liberty without due process of law nor denied equal protection of the law under this section merely because an information charging defendant with embezzlement incorrectly refers to a repealed section since the offense was otherwise sufficiently charged.Smith v. Abram, 1954-NMSC-061, 58 N.M. 404, 271 P.2d 1010.\n\nIV. EVIDENCE AND ISSUES.\n\nSingle criminal intent doctrine inapplicable.— Court did not commit fundamental error by refusing to instruct jury that the state was required to prove that each instance of embezzlement charged was the result of a distinct criminal impulse; the single criminal intent doctrine no longer applies to embezzlement cases, in light of the 1995 amendment of this section (adding the second sentence in the first paragraph).State v. Faubion, 1998-NMCA-095, 125 N.M. 670, 964 P.2d 834, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 322, 961 P.2d 167 (decided under prior law).\n\nTestimony of C.P.A.— In an embezzlement prosecution, a certified public accountant may testify as to his findings from an examination of books and records not in evidence and not produced at the trial.State v. Schrader, 1958-NMSC-056, 64 N.M. 100, 324 P.2d 1025.\n\nFactual question as to ownership of funds.— Where there was evidence that the victims gave checks to the defendant, knowing they had insufficient funds in the bank to cover the checks, on the defendant's representations that he wanted the checks to show to investors and that the checks would not be cashed, this evidence raised a factual question as to whether ownership of the funds represented by the checks passed or was intended to pass to defendant.State v. Schifani, 1978-NMCA-080, 92 N.M. 127, 584 P.2d 174, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324.\n\nNo mistake-of-fact instruction unless employee believed he was authorized to expend employer's funds.— The defendant is not entitled to a mistake-of-fact instruction in a prosecution for embezzlement for using public funds belonging to his employer to pay for the travel expenses of his spouse, who is not employed by the same employer and who has not performed any public service, on the ground that he believed in good faith he was owed money by his employer, where there is no evidence that he in fact believed he possessed the legal authority to expend public funds for his spouse's travel.State v. Gonzales, 1983-NMCA-041, 99 N.M. 734, 663 P.2d 710, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 644, 662 P.2d 645, and cert. denied, 464 U.S. 855, 104 S. Ct. 173, 78 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1983).\n\nQuestion of entrustment is a question of fact for the jury.State v. Peke, 1962-NMSC-033, 70 N.M. 108, 371 P.2d 226, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 924, 83 S. Ct. 293, 9 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1962).\n\nJury to be instructed on ordinary meaning of term.— The usual, ordinary meaning of \"entrusted\" was applicable to this section, and defendant therefore was not entitled to an instruction defining entrustment as a designated fiduciary relationship.State v. Moss, 1971-NMCA-117, 83 N.M. 42, 487 P.2d 1347.\n\nSince defendant not entrusted with money, offense not embezzlement.— Although a defendant is in charge of an entire store, where the undisputed facts show that money in a drop-box is not committed or surrendered to the defendant's care, use or disposal, that the money is to be handled exclusively by the manager, and where the defendant is excluded from having anything to do with that money, his offense, as to taking the money in the drop-box, is larceny, not embezzlement, because he had not been entrusted with that money.State v. Stahl, 1979-NMCA-054, 93 N.M. 62, 596 P.2d 275, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 8, 595 P.2d 1203.\n\nEntrustment established.— Where defendant, for some five years, acted as executive secretary of state association and, in effect, operated the business transactions of the association, including the making of bank deposits and submitting reports to the board of directors, evidence supported the jury finding of entrustment of the money of the association.State v. Peke, 1962-NMSC-033, 70 N.M. 108, 371 P.2d 226, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 924, 83 S. Ct. 293, 9 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1962).\n\nSufficiency of evidence.— There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of embezzlement; the evidence showed that defendant was entrusted with the victim's money, the victim asked for it back, and defendant, having converted the money for his own use, knowingly wrote a check to the victim that defendant knew would be returned for insufficient funds.State v. Curry, 2002-NMCA-092, 132 N.M. 602, 52 P.3d 974, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 397, 49 P.3d 76.\n\nDistrict court did not err in denying defendant's motion for directed where there was sufficient evidence of embezzlement.— Where defendant was charged with embezzlement, and where, at trial, evidence was established that in December of 2019, a customer brought a 2008 Chevrolet pick-up truck into an automotive shop operated by defendant for repairs, that defendant told the customer that the truck needed a new transmission and that he could order one, that the customer gave defendant a check for $3,630, that the check's memo line stated \"2008 Silverado Transmission\", that defendant cashed the check, that over the next several months defendant gave the customer inconsistent explanations about the transmission's status, that in May 2020, the customer had the truck towed from defendant's shop, and that the truck had been damaged and was missing parts, and where, after the state's case, defendant moved for a directed verdict, the district court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict, because there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that the $3,630 had been earmarked to be used for a particular purpose, that defendant was entrusted with the money to purchase a transmission, and that based on the truck's condition upon recovery and the inconsistent explanations about the status and location of the transmission that defendant never intended to complete the work for which he was paid, and that defendant, therefore, converted the money to his own use.State v. Ferguson, 2023-NMCA-029, cert. denied.\n\nInsufficient evidence of entrustment to support embezzlement conviction.— Where defendant, a homebuilder hired to build homes in a luxury golf community in Santa Fe, was charged with embezzlement for his failure to finish several construction projects, and where evidence at trial established that defendant's clients paid initial deposits to defendant to be used toward construction costs of their new homes, there was insufficient evidence to convict defendant of embezzlement because contractors cannot be convicted of embezzlement of down payment of funds upon a failure to complete a project because deposit money is legally the property of the contractor at the time it is paid. Consequently, at the time defendant used the deposit money for purposes other than the construction of the properties, the deposits already legally belonged to defendant; he could not be found to have converted deposits because they were his property, not the property of another.State v. Kalinowski, 2020-NMCA-018, cert. denied.\n\nElectronic monitoring devices covered by embezzlement statute.— Defendant probationer was entrusted with an electronic monitoring device (EMD) within the meaning of this section, and his disposal of the EMD in an effort to end the state's ability to monitor his movements was evidence that he used it for his own purpose and evidence of his fraudulent intent.State v. Archie, 1997-NMCA-058, 123 N.M. 503, 943 P.2d 537.\n\nFraud or embezzlement for jury.— It was for the jury to decide whether defendant obtained the $500 by fraud or converted to his own use the money with which he had been entrusted.State v. Ortiz, 1977-NMCA-036, 90 N.M. 319, 563 P.2d 113.\n\nWhether defendant received property as loan or for investment jury question.— In a trial for fraud and embezzlement where the evidence was conflicting, whether the money and checks given to the defendant were loans, as he claimed, or were for investments, as his alleged victims claimed, was for the jury to decide.State v. Schifani, 1978-NMCA-080, 92 N.M. 127, 584 P.2d 174, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324.\n\nEvidence of amount owed victims not dispositive of case.— In a trial for a third-degree embezzlement felony, the fact that the victims eventually \"lost\" an amount less than $2,500 was not dispositive, as there was substantial evidence that the defendant, with the requisite fraudulent intent, negotiated for his own use checks in the amount of $3,900, which he had been entrusted to hold and not cash.State v. Schifani, 1978-NMCA-080, 92 N.M. 127, 584 P.2d 174, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324.\n\nSale of borrowed property.— Evidence that defendant sold a motorcycle to complaining witness, that subsequently, motorcycle was loaned back to defendant, and that although requested to do so, defendant did not return motorcycle but sold it to a third person established an embezzlement as defined in this section.State v. Gregg, 1972-NMCA-001, 83 N.M. 397, 492 P.2d 1260, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 562, 494 P.2d 975.\n\nEvidence of intent inconsistent with innocence.— While evidence was circumstantial, once the jury determined that defendant who sold motorcycle to third party had already sold it to complaining witness, circumstantial evidence of intent was inconsistent with any reasonable theory of innocence.State v. Gregg, 1972-NMCA-001, 83 N.M. 397, 492 P.2d 1260, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 562, 494 P.2d 975.\n\nEmbezzlement of checks.— The state satisfied its burden as to the embezzlement when it showed that two checks were cashed and the other two were deposited in the defendant's personal checking account, and it made very little difference whether other funds were used, as defendant sought to imply, to make up the discrepancy; the embezzlement occurred at the moment of the cashing of the checks.State v. Peke, 1962-NMSC-033, 70 N.M. 108, 371 P.2d 226, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 924, 83 S. Ct. 293, 9 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1962).\n\nFailure to account for fine.— A justice of the peace (now magistrate) could be indicted for the embezzlement of a fine imposed and collected for which he never accounted, either before or after expiration of his term of office.Territory v. Heacock, 1889-NMSC-006, 5 N.M. 54, 20 P. 171.\n\nNo evidence to support attempt charge.— Evidence that defendant was loaned a car and hadn't returned it more than three days later, shows that he was guilty of embezzlement or no crime at all, and did not support an issue of \"attempt.\"State v. Moss, 1971-NMCA-117, 83 N.M. 42, 487 P.2d 1347.\n\nBreach of trust not embezzlement.— Defendant who was guilty of nothing more serious than a breach of trust could not be convicted for embezzlement.Territory v. Eyles, 1911-NMSC-068, 16 N.M. 657, 119 P. 1127.\n\nUnexplained comparison of computer printouts and defendant's records violates right of confrontation.— Defendant was denied her constitutional right of confrontation at her trial for embezzlement, where the only evidence of shortages attributable to her was obtained by an unexplained comparison of computer printouts with her own records and there was no evidence that the state's only witness understood how the printouts were prepared.State v. Austin, 1985-NMCA-118, 104 N.M. 573, 725 P.2d 252, cert. quashed, 104 N.M. 632, 725 P.2d 832.\n\nWhen directed verdict proper.— If there are reasonable inferences and sufficient circumstances then the issue of intent becomes a question of fact for the jury, and only where there are no reasonable inferences or sufficient surrounding circumstances can it be said, as a matter of law, that a motion for a directed verdict should have been granted or that a charge should not have been presented to the jury.State v. Ortiz, 1977-NMCA-036, 90 N.M. 319, 563 P.2d 113.\n\nCircumstantial evidence supported store manager's convictionof embezzlement, where the state presented evidence of discrepancies between the daily sales reports and deposit slips indicating shortages on six days, and the facts relied upon by defendant were not uncontroverted and consisted of issues of credibility to be resolved by the jury as finders of fact.State v. James, 1989-NMCA-089, 109 N.M. 278, 784 P.2d 1021, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 262, 784 P.2d 1005.\n\nJury instruction on single larceny doctrine appropriate.— Single larceny doctrine recognizes either that a taking at one time or place of property belonging to several people may constitute a single crime, or, that a series of takings from one owner may also constitute a single crime and therefore these crimes cannot be separately punished. Since the facts and circumstances showed a series of acts that cannot be said as a matter of law to be either a single taking or separate takings, for a defendant to be separately convicted and sentenced for each taking, the state also had to show separate intent. Under the aforementioned circumstances, it is fundamental error for the trial court not to instruct the jury on the single criminal intent doctrine.State v. Brooks, 1994-NMSC-062, 117 N.M. 751, 877 P.2d 557 (decided under prior law).\n\nMistake of fact instruction.— Since there was a question whether defendant rightfully applied certain construction payments to the balance allegedly due him by the plaintiff, defendant was entitled to an instruction on mistake of fact, the omission of which constituted reversible error.State v. Bunce, 1993-NMSC-057, 116 N.M. 284, 861 P.2d 965.\n\nJury instruction on intent deficient.— Jury instruction which omitted the essential element of fraudulent intent required by this section was deficient, and required reversal of defendant's conviction for embezzlement.State v. Green, 1993-NMSC-056, 116 N.M. 273, 861 P.2d 954.\n\nFraudulent intent instruction.— Failure to instruct the jury on an essential element of embezzlement, fraudulent intent, is reversible error and can never be corrected by including the concept elsewhere in the instructions.State v. Clifford, 1994-NMSC-048, 117 N.M. 508, 873 P.2d 254.\n\nEssential elements of embezzlement.— The essential elements of the offense of embezzlement are that the property belonged to someone other than the accused, that the accused occupied a designated fiduciary relationship, that the property came into his possession by reason of his employment or office, and that there was a fraudulent intent to deprive the owner of his property. 1954 Op.

Barber, 1979-NMCA-137, 93 N.M. 782, 606 P.2d 192, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 628, 614 P.2d 545.\n\nExtortion is completed crimewhen defendant's threat is communicated to the victim with the requisite statutory intent.State v.

Wheeler, 1980-NMCA-185, 95 N.M. 378, 622 P.2d 283.\n\n\"Threats\" included in section.— This section includes both written and oral threats and also includes actions constituting threats.State v. Barber, 1979-NMCA-137, 93 N.M. 782, 606 P.2d 192, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 628, 614 P.2d 545.\n\nAllegation of nature of threat.— Indictment under Laws 1853-1854, p. 94 (former 40-46-1, 1953 Comp.) was insufficient where it simply charged that defendant threatened another, without alleging that such threat was to injure the person or property of another.State v. Strickland, 1916-NMSC-008, 21 N.M. 411, 155 P. 719.\n\nThreat of injury is extortion.— Where defendant was given a psychological evaluation; defendant asked to see the evaluation report and became angry upon reading the report; subsequently, defendant asked again for a copy of the report; the custodian of the report refused to give defendant a copy of the report because of defendant's mental state; defendant wrote letters to the custodian in which defendant threatened to harm the custodian if the custodian did not give defendant a copy of the report; and defendant has a right to receive a copy of the report, defendant was guilty of extortion.Rael v. Sullivan, 918 F.2d 874 (10th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 928, 111 S. Ct. 1328, 113 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1991).\n\n\"Unlawful injury\" as breach of contract is question for legislature.— Whether \"unlawful injury\" within the meaning of Subsection A encompasses a mere breach of contract is a question which the legislature may wish to clarify.State v. Ashley, 1989-NMCA-018, 108 N.M. 343, 772 P.2d 377, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 433, 773 P.2d 1240.\n\nPhrase \"to wrongfully compel\"refers to the manner in which the defendant compels an act, rather than the legitimacy of the defendant's objective.Rael v.

Ed. 2d 260 (1991).\n\nWrongfully compelling an act.— A bank's policy of requiring execution of a forgery affidavit and prosecution of an alleged forgery as a condition precedent to reimbursement of a customer's account did not constitute extortion under this section.Sunwest Bank v.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nRequest for false notations.— Although the defendant admittedly told the maker of the checks to put false notations on them indicating that the defendant received the checks in the course of his employment, rather than for personal goods and services, which represented a misrepresentation upon the face of the checks that cast doubt on his general truthfulness and moral character, the notations did not support a logical inference that petitioner knew the checks were forged, since the purpose of the notations was to facilitate cashing the third-party checks, and they served the same purpose regardless of whether the checks were good or were forged.Stallings v. Tansy, 28 F.3d 1018 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\nWriting one's true name in payee line.— Defendant's alteration of a traveler's check by writing his name in the second payee line after the rightful owner had signed the first payee line did not alter the legal effect of the traveler's check. Any subsequent holder of the check should have known that it was not negotiable. Thus, defendant did not commit forgery.State v. Carbajal, 2002-NMSC-019, 132 N.M. 326, 48 P.3d 64.\n\nPhysical act not always a transfer.— It is possible to have a physical act which is an attempt to transfer one's interest but to have such an attempt thwarted at some stage of perpetration.State v. Tooke, 1970-NMCA-068, 81 N.M. 618, 471 P.2d 188,overruled on other grounds byState v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nPresentation of check a complete transfer.— Where defendant presented a forged check to a bank teller for cashing, fact that the teller, somewhat suspicious, took the check to her supervisor, whereupon the police were called and defendant was arrested, did not convert the crime into an attempt, since the transfer of interest by the defendant had already occurred; the fact that defendant received nothing and that there was no injury or loss was immaterial.State v. Linam, 1977-NMCA-082, 90 N.M. 729, 568 P.2d 255, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 3, 569 P.2d 413,overruled on other grounds by,State v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nSigning brother's name to traffic citation.— Motorist who gave officer brother's name and signed brother's name to three traffic citations could be prosecuted for forgery; there was no requirement under the forgery laws that he intended to injure or defraud his brother or that he actually succeed in injuring or defrauding someone.State v. Wasson, 1998-NMCA-087, 125 N.M. 656, 964 P.2d 820, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 322, 961 P.2d 167.\n\nEndorsement of own name without authorization not forgery.— Where defendant endorsed or caused his name to be endorsed to a check, this was not a false endorsement, only an endorsement without authorization; and, thus, not forgery as defined in this section.State v. Deutsch, 1985-NMCA-123, 103 N.M. 752, 713 P.2d 1008, cert. denied, 103 N.M. 740, 713 P.2d 556, and cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1183, 106 S. Ct. 2918, 91 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1986).\n\nConsecutive sentences proper.— Trial court did not err in imposing consecutive sentences on three counts of forgery, since the common law gave trial courts the discretion to make sentences consecutive or concurrent.State v. Crouch, 1965-NMSC-131, 75 N.M. 533, 407 P.2d 671.\n\nIf defendant assumes name and identity of deceased person,goes into the military and obtains identification under his assumed name, uses the identification to open a checking account, and then writes and signs checks under his assumed name and tenders them to various stores in return for valuable merchandise, such acts do not purport to be those of another and therefore forgery has not been committed.State v. Cook, 1979-NMCA-070, 93 N.M. 91, 596 P.2d 860.\n\nUnauthorized alteration of instrument.— Unauthorized alteration of a genuine instrument, of the kind contemplated by the statute, with the requisite fraudulent intent, is forgery under this section.State v. Cowley, 1968-NMCA-011, 79 N.M. 49, 439 P.2d 567, cert. denied, 79 N.M. 98, 440 P.2d 136.\n\nWhere defendant came into possession of a check validly signed (such that it was bearer paper) but not filled in, his unauthorized filling in of the blank spaces of the check was an alteration within the purview of the forgery statute.State v. Smith, 1981-NMCA-003, 95 N.M. 432, 622 P.2d 1052.\n\nAlteration of invoice.— Unauthorized addition to the invoice of items not purchased by the customer and a change of the amount which the customer had directed to be charged to his account constituted an alteration of the instrument within forgery offense.State v. Cowley, 1968-NMCA-011, 79 N.M. 49, 439 P.2d 567, cert. denied, 79 N.M. 98, 440 P.2d 136.\n\nII. ELEMENTS.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nElements.— Both knowledge and intent are essential elements of forgery.State v. Morales, 2000-NMCA-046, 129 N.M. 141, 2 P.3d 878, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 207, 4 P.3d 35.\n\nSigning documents with a false nameis not a forgery when the signatory has assumed the name as his own identity and when the signed document only imposes liability on the person signing it.State v. Sandoval, 2007-NMCA-103, 142 N.M. 412, 166 P.3d 473, cert. quashed, 2008-NMCERT-004, 144 N.M. 49, 183 P.3d 934.\n\nElements of offense.— A forgery is completed when a defendant possessing the requisite intent: (1) falsely makes or alters a writing which purports to have legal efficacy; (2) physically delivers a forged writing; or (3) passes an interest in a forged writing.State v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\n\"Issuing\" and \"transferring\".— The terms \"issuing\" and \"transferring\" encompass a delivery to one who is a holder with the passing of interests from one to another.State v. Tooke, 1970-NMCA-068, 81 N.M. 618, 471 P.2d 188,overruled on other grounds byState v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nA defendant may issue or transfer a forged writing either by a physical delivery of the forged instrument for action by a third party or by passing an interest in the forged instrument to a third party.State v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nA defendant issues a forged writing when he or she knowingly physically delivers the false instrument, offers the false instrument, or otherwise makes the false instrument available for action.State v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nA defendant transfers a forged writing when he or she knowingly conveys an interest contained in the false instrument. For instance, a stock certificate may be forged to indicate a false owner.State v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nEach forged instrument a separate offense.— This section makes each act of forgery, each forged instrument, a separate offense.State v. Baca, 1997-NMSC-018, 123 N.M. 124, 934 P.2d 1053.\n\nB. LEGAL EFFICACY.\n\nLegal efficacy of doctor's note and order for tests.— A doctor's note and order for diagnostic tests that were used to create an excuse for the defendant's non-appearance at a court-ordered appointment are not instruments purporting to have legal efficacy and cannot be made the foundation for a forgery conviction.State v. Scott, 2008-NMCA-075, 144 N.M. 231, 185 P.3d 1081, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-004, 144 N.M. 47, 183 P.3d 932.\n\nNon-commercial documents.— A non-commercial document purports to have legal efficacy if it is a document required by law to be filed or recorded or necessary or convenient to the discharge of a public official's duties and if it is an instrument which upon its face could be made the foundation of liability and if it is an instrument good and valid for the purpose for which it was created.State v. Martinez, 2008-NMCA-058, 144 N.M. 50, 183 P.3d 935, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-003, 143 N.M. 682, 180 P.3d 1181.\n\nThe act of signing an intake fingerprint card with an assumed namewhen being booked into jail constitutes forgery.State v. Martinez, 2008-NMCA-058, 144 N.M. 50, 183 P.3d 935, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-003, 143 N.M. 682, 180 P.3d 1181.\n\nAn employment application lacks legal efficacy. —State v. Sandoval, 2007-NMCA-103, 142 N.M. 412, 166 P.3d 473, cert. quashed, 2008-NMCERT-004, 144 N.M. 49, 183 P.3d 934.\n\nEmployment eligibility verification forms,known as Form I-9; W-4 forms; social security cards; and resident alien cards have legal efficacy.State v. Sandoval, 2007-NMCA-103, 142 N.M. 412, 166 P.3d 473, cert. quashed, 2008-NMCERT-004, 144 N.M. 49, 183 P.3d 934.\n\nPhrase not unconstitutionally vague.— Phrase \"legal efficacy\" as applied in forgery statute to a writing is not so vague and uncertain in meaning as to offend constitutional requirements of certainty as it means an instrument which upon its face could be made the foundation of liability or an instrument good and valid for the purpose for which it was created.State v. Cowley, 1968-NMCA-011, 79 N.M. 49, 439 P.2d 567, cert. denied, 79 N.M. 98, 440 P.2d 136.\n\nObjects of forgery.— Bingo cards purport to have legal efficacy which can be the object of a forgery.State v. Nguyen, 1997-NMCA-037, 123 N.M. 290, 939 P.2d 1098.\n\nCounterfeit bills are instruments purporting to have legal efficacy and therefore may be the basis of a forgery charge.— Where defendant was arrested and charged with forgery after attempting to pay for items at a gas station with two counterfeit ten dollar bills, and where he claimed that because counterfeit bills cannot constitute a forged writing, he cannot be guilty of forgery, the district court did not err in finding that defendant was properly charged, because the definition of a \"forged writing,\" as set forth in 30-16-10 NMSA 1978, is a writing purporting to have legal efficacy, and in this case defendant conceded that counterfeit bills are instruments purporting to have legal efficacy; counterfeit bills are therefore forged writings that can be the basis of a forgery charge.State v. Valdez, 2024-NMCA-072, cert. denied.\n\nLegal efficacyis an essential element of the forgery offense and a purely legal issue.State v. Cearley, 2004-NMCA-079, 135 N.M. 710, 92 P.3d 1284, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-007, 137 N.M. 280, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nInterpretation of legal efficacy requirement that would expand forgeryto encompass the falsification or alteration of any item with potential evidentiary value is not supported.State v. Cearley, 2004-NMCA-079, 135 N.M. 710, 92 P.3d 1284, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-007, 137 N.M. 280, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nThe element of forgery requiring that the defendant has falsely made or altered an instrument purporting to have legal efficacy should not be expanded to include instances where the sole legal value of the instrument is its potential use as evidence.State v. Cearley, 2004-NMCA-079, 135 N.M. 710, 92 P.3d 1284, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-007, 137 N.M. 280, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nInauthentic document that has been presented to opposing counsel during discovery in civil matterand that has no legal efficacy apart from its potential evidentiary value cannot be the subject of a forgery prosecution.State v. Cearley, 2004-NMCA-079, 135 N.M. 710, 92 P.3d 1284, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-007, 137 N.M. 280, 110 P.3d 506.\n\n\"Legal efficacy\" of postdated checks.— Where the forged writing involved an endorsement made or attempted of the name of the payee, the checks, although postdated, upon their face possessed sufficient legal efficacy to defraud and were properly the subject of forgery.State v. Lopez, 1969-NMCA-115, 81 N.M. 107, 464 P.2d 23, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 140, 464 P.2d 559 (1970),overruled on other grounds byState v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nChanging legal effect of check.— Where defendant found a check written out to \"Cash\" and, when he presented the check to a credit union teller to cash it, he added his name on the payee line next to \"Cash,\" and endorsed the check, his actions did not change the legal effect of the check from a bearer instrument into an order instrument under 55-3-109 NMSA 1978, and he did not commit the crime of forgery.State v. Herrera, 2001-NMCA-007, 130 N.M. 85, 18 P.3d 326, cert. denied, 130 N.M. 153, 20 P.3d 810.\n\n\"Legal efficacy\" of receipts.— Documents consisting of a receipt for money purporting to show that defendant had paid cash to the immigration and naturalization service (INS) as a processing fee for immigration applications and a return receipt from the United States postal service indicating INS had received the applications were \"of legal efficacy\" as required by this section.State v. Torres, 2000-NMCA-038, 129 N.M. 51, 1 P.3d 433, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 208, 4 P.3d 36.\n\nNon-carbon records of checksdo not purport to have legal efficacy in and of themselves.State v. Cearley, 2004-NMCA-079, 135 N.M. 710, 92 P.3d 1284, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-007, 137 N.M. 280, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nIntent.— According to the forgery statute, the appropriate mens rea is that the defendant have actual knowledge that the document is a forgery.State v. Garvin, 2005-NMCA-107, 138 N.M. 164, 117 P.3d 970, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-008, 138 N.M. 328, 119 P.3d 1265.\n\nAcceptance of forged instrument is unnecessaryto complete the crime of forgery.State v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nGain or loss not required.— Forgery is complete when the false instrument is issued or transferred with the requisite intent, regardless of its acceptance. The forgery statute does not require that the defendant gain, or that the prospective victim experience a loss or injury to complete the crime.State v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nOne commits forgery when he makes up check(assuming the requisite knowledge and intent), whether he or someone else places a false signature on it.State v. Saavedra, 1979-NMCA-096, 93 N.M. 242, 599 P.2d 395.\n\nSection requires intent to injure or defraud.State v. Thurman, 1975-NMCA-049, 88 N.M. 31, 536 P.2d 1087, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 29, 536 P.2d 1085,overruled on other grounds byState v. Ellenberger, 1981-NMSC-056, 96 N.M. 287, 629 P.2d 1216.\n\nIntent to injure in general sufficient.— General intent to injure or defraud was sufficient for conviction of forgery; it was not necessary to allege or prove intent to injure or defraud a particular person.State v. Smith, 1927-NMSC-012, 32 N.M. 191, 252 P. 1003.\n\nActual injury not required.— For there to be an intent to defraud, an injury or loss need not have actually resulted and for such an intent it is immaterial that no one was in fact deceived, or that the defendant did not intend to or did not make any financial gain as it is sufficient if the intent was to defraud any person on whom the counterfeit is passed.State v. Nation, 1973-NMCA-087, 85 N.M. 291, 511 P.2d 777.\n\nSufficient evidence of knowledge and intent.— Where defendant successfully cashed a check ostensibly signed by defendant's parent on the parent's closed account; when defendant later attempted to cash another check on the same account at the same store, when defendant learned that the police had been called, defendant ran out of the store and entered a waiting car behind the store; and defendant's parent testified that the parent had not authorized defendant to sign checks on the closed account, the evidence was to establish knowledge and intent elements for forgery.State v. Morrales, 2000-NMCA-046, 129 N.M. 141, 2 P.3d 878, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 207, 4 P.3d 35.\n\nIntent to injure or defraud.— The crime of forgery was completed when the false making of the signature with intent to injure or defraud had been accomplished, and an injury or loss need not actually have resulted.State v. Weber, 1966-NMSC-164, 76 N.M. 636, 417 P.2d 444.\n\nIII. INDICTMENT AND INFORMATION.\n\nSeverance.— Failure to sever two counts of forgery arising from two separate incidents involving alteration of bingo cards did not prejudice the defendant since the evidence of the two offenses would be independently admissible in separate trials to prove the essential elements of intent and knowledge.State v. Nguyen, 1997-NMCA-037, 123 N.M. 290, 939 P.2d 1098.\n\nIndictment sufficient.— An indictment for forgery, alleging that the act was unlawfully, falsely and feloniously done, sufficiently excluded authorization by the person whose act it purported to be.State v. Smith, 1927-NMSC-012, 32 N.M. 191, 252 P. 1003.\n\nIV. EVIDENCE.\n\nCircumstantial evidence of knowing forgery.— Where the state elicited circumstantial evidence of defendant's knowledge that the checks he cashed were forged, which included his failure to make arrangements to pay the merchant after being advised that the checks had not been honored, his prior felony conviction, and his admitted requesting false notations on the checks, which indicated they were given him by employers with whom the merchant was familiar, and that he did so in order to make the checks easier to cash, this was sufficient to support an inference that defendant knew the checks were forged.State v. Stallings, 1986-NMCA-086, 104 N.M. 660, 725 P.2d 1228, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 632, 725 P.2d 832.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where defendant presented a check for cashing at a store; the check was drawn on the victim's business account, payable to defendant in payment for labor; the victim testified that the victim had never employed defendant or written a check to defendant for labor; and a bank employee testified that the signature on the check was not the victim's signature, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for forgery.State v. Caldwell, 2008-NMCA-049, 143 N.M. 792, 182 P.3d 775, cert. denied, 2000-NMCERT-003, 143 N.M. 681, 180 P.3d 1180.\n\nEvidence sufficient to find defendant signed checks.— Although the state did not offer a handwriting expert to match the signature on counterfeit traveller's checks with that of the defendant, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did sign several of the checks; the checks were counterfeit, a hotel room registration card for a room checked out to an accomplice in the fraud bore the defendant's signature; the defendant was identified by several of the store clerks involved as the person who had passed the counterfeit checks in purchasing items; and many of the items purchased were found in the room where the defendant stayed.State v. Rotibi, 1994-NMCA-003, 117 N.M. 108, 869 P.2d 296, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 215, 870 P.2d 753.\n\nProving forgery of check.— The court held that proof of forgery of a check need not include a showing that the drawee bank would not have honored it.State v. Lopez, 1969-NMCA-115, 81 N.M. 107, 464 P.2d 23, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 140, 464 P.2d 559,overruled on other grounds byState v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nLack of account or authority.— Evidence that the company attempted to be drawn on did not have an account with the drawee bank or that the person who signed the check was not authorized to sign checks on behalf of the corporation were not elements of proof prerequisite to defendant's conviction involving a false endorsement with intent to defraud.State v. Lopez, 1969-NMCA-115, 81 N.M. 107, 464 P.2d 23, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 140, 464 P.2d 559,overruled on other grounds byState v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nInference of nonauthorization warranted.— Representations that defendants were the persons named as payees of the checks made for the purpose of inducing the respective clerks to cash the checks, reasonably warranted the inference that defendants did not have the right to use the names of payees of the checks, and were not, in fact, such payees and that they did not have authority to endorse the checks in the names of payees.State v. Lopez, 1969-NMCA-115, 81 N.M. 107, 464 P.2d 23, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 140, 464 P.2d 559,overruled on other grounds byState v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nSubstantial evidence supported forgery convictions.— Where defendant, a franchisee, wrote checks provided by franchisor payable to herself and co-defendant, neither of whom was authorized to receive these funds, in amounts totaling over $200,000, and where defendant was charged with forgery, conspiracy to commit forgery, fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud and embezzlement, and co-defendant was charged with forgery, conspiracy to commit forgery, fraud (over $2,500 but less than $20,000) and fraud (over $20,000), and where defendants claimed that substantial evidence did not support their forgery convictions because the checks and signature stamps used in the scheme were genuine and defendant endorsed the checks with her own genuine signature, there was sufficient evidence to support the forgery convictions because defendant's use of a signature stamp and the checks outside the scope of their authorization were acts which, when combined with the required intent to injure or defraud, constituted forgery.State v. Candelaria, 2019-NMCA-032, cert. denied.\n\nAiding and abetting check forgery.— The fact that defendant was not the person who passed an interest in forged checks did not preclude defendant's conviction under this section if the evidence of defendant's aiding and abetting of unidentified woman who actually passed the checks was sufficient.State v. Martinez, 1973-NMCA-075, 85 N.M. 198, 510 P.2d 916.\n\nMere presence not aiding and abetting.— The fact that defendant accompanied the forger of certain checks at the time that she cashed them was not sufficient to support a finding of aiding and abetting, for mere presence and even mental approbation, if unaccompanied by outward manifestation or expression of such approval, is insufficient.State v. Hermosillo, 1975-NMCA-113, 88 N.M. 424, 540 P.2d 1313.\n\nEndorsing and vouching for forged check.— To be an aider or abettor to a forgery, defendant must have shared an intent to injure or defraud, and where uncontradicted evidence was that defendant vouched for and endorsed check forged by unidentified companion, such evidence, although circumstantial, was sufficient to show such intent.State v. Martinez, 1973-NMCA-075, 85 N.M. 198, 510 P.2d 916.\n\nGuilty knowledge not shown.— Where the woman who forged signature on certain checks testified that the defendant, who drove her to two different branches of a bank in a three-hour period to cash them, and deposited them in the bank's drawer and cylinder respectively, did not know that the checks were forged, and the only other fact upon which a finding of defendant's guilty knowledge could be based was his presence in a car next to the owners at the time the checks may have been stolen, the evidence did not form a sufficient basis upon which to rest a conclusion of defendant's guilty knowledge.State v. Hermosillo, 1975-NMCA-113, 88 N.M. 424, 540 P.2d 1313.\n\nReasonable hypotheses of innocence.— Circumstantial evidence was insufficient to allow a finding that defendant aided forger by procuring checks for her because there were too many other explanations to account for her possession of the checks, so that the evidence was not incompatible with the innocence of the accused upon any rational theory and incapable of explanation upon any reasonable hypothesis of the defendant's innocence.State v. Hermosillo, 1975-NMCA-113, 88 N.M. 424, 540 P.2d 1313.\n\nCheck forgery substantiated.— Despite discrepancies in testimony of certain witnesses, there was sufficient corroborated and uncontradicted testimony to substantiate verdict of guilty on three counts of check forgery.State v. Crouch, 1965-NMSC-131, 75 N.M. 533, 407 P.2d 671.\n\nNo evidence of check forgery.— Where there was ample evidence that the maker of check cashed by defendant, which he claimed to have received in payment for three days of work, did not have an account in the bank on which it was drawn, but not one iota of evidence that check was a forgery, conviction of knowingly uttering a forged instrument with intent to defraud was reversed.State v. Bibbins, 1960-NMSC-006, 66 N.M. 363, 348 P.2d 484.\n\nNo basis for a charge of forgery when defendant did not make or manufacture a false document.— Where defendant was convicted of forgery, conspiracy to commit forgery, and perjury, and where the evidence presented indicated that defendant signed an affidavit of New Mexico residency, under penalty of perjury, declaring that he was a friend of a foreign national who sought a driver's license from the motor vehicle division (MVD) and that the foreign national lived with defendant in Albuquerque, when in fact, the foreign national did not live at the address as attested to by defendant in the affidavit, the evidence was insufficient to support forgery or conspiracy to commit forgery, because a forgery statute punishes those who falsely make an affidavit, whereas a perjury statute punishes those who make and certify a false affidavit; if a person includes false statements in an affidavit that the person signs under oath, that person has made and certified a false affidavit, which cannot be the basis of a forgery conviction, and defendant did not make or manufacture a false document, but used a genuine MVD affidavit form and signed it with his actual name.State v. Leong, 2017-NMCA-070, cert. denied.\n\nTransfer of forged prescription.— Evidence that a physician's signature had been forged on one of his prescription blanks and that defendant presented this forged prescription to a pharmacist and obtained the drug identified in the prescription, was sufficient to show defendant knowingly transferred a forged prescription with an intent to injure or defraud.State v. Nation, 1973-NMCA-087, 85 N.M. 291, 511 P.2d 777.\n\nForging signature on assignment of title.— Falsely signing name of automobile owner to assignment of title and notarizing same, where evidence amply supported finding of intent to injure or defraud, constituted crime of forgery.State v. Weber, 1966-NMSC-164, 76 N.M. 636, 417 P.2d 444.\n\nIntent to wrongfully deprive another.— Evidence was sufficient to support a finding of intent to wrongfully or fraudulently deprive another of a lawful right, interest or property, where car and false assignment were delivered to third-party purchaser who used same for at least nine days, vehicle was sold for less than worth and at private sale rather than public sale to which owner was entitled, and difference between amount owing and purchase price was not paid to owner; furthermore, even if it could be said that defendant, as secured party, legally took possession of car and was thus entitled to dispose of it by private sale, still he failed to give reasonable notification of the time after which sale would be made, or to account for the surplus money received from the sale.State v. Weber, 1966-NMSC-164, 76 N.M. 636, 417 P.2d 444.\n\nSubstantial evidence of intent required.— Guilty knowledge is rarely susceptible of direct and positive proof and generally can be established only through circumstantial evidence, but this does not remove the obligation to examine the evidence to determine whether there was substantial evidence to support a finding of intent.State v. Hermosillo, 1975-NMCA-113, 88 N.M. 424, 540 P.2d 1313.\n\nAdmissibility of exhibits.— Envelope containing money found in defendant's possession shortly after cashing second of two forged checks tended to throw light on the transaction, and considered with the time and distance factors involved, circumstantially connected defendant with the criminal offense.State v. Belcher, 1971-NMCA-135, 83 N.M. 130, 489 P.2d 410.\n\nRed plastic wallet identified by witnesses as belonging to defendant, containing identification card bearing the name of the payee named in two forged checks, which was found around the corner from business where second check was cashed, was admissible, despite weakness of evidence of chain of custody after it was found and as to whether the contents were in the same condition at trial as when found; doubt concerning the exhibit would go to the weight to be accorded it.State v. Belcher, 1971-NMCA-135, 83 N.M. 130, 489 P.2d 410.\n\nCashier's description of contents of forged checkwas sufficient proof, and the state's failure to introduce the forged check at trial did not preclude a conviction for forgery.State v. Ruffins, 1990-NMSC-035, 109 N.M. 668, 789 P.2d 616.\n\nV. INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nInstruction regarding type of intent.— Where on appeal it was contended an error occurred for the district court to give a general intent instruction without instructing the jury that it did not apply to a specific intent crime, because the instruction substantially followed the applicable law, there was no fundamental error.State v. Gee, 2004-NMCA-042, 135 N.M. 408, 89 P.3d 80, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-003, 135 N.M. 321, 88 P.3d 261.\n\nVI. DOUBLE JEOPARDY.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— A forgery offense may be subsumed within an attempted fraud offense.State v. Lee, 2009-NMCA-075, 146 N.M. 605, 213 P.3d 509, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-006, 146 N.M. 733, 215 P.3d 42.\n\nConvictions for fraud and forgery may not violate double jeopardy.State v. Caldwell, 2008-NMCA-049, 143 N.M. 792, 182 P.3d 775, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-003, 143 N.M. 681, 180 P.3d 1180.\n\nWhere sufficient evidence exists to establish that each false signing was distinct from the others a defendant's acts are separated by sufficient indicia of distinctness to justify multiple punishments under the same statute.State v. Glascock, 2008-NMCA-006, 143 N.M. 328, 176 P.3d 317, cert. quashed, 2009-NMCERT-006, 146 N.M. 734, 215 P.3d 43.\n\nForgery and attempted fraud.— Where defendant was convicted for forgery and attempted fraud over $250 arising out of the unitary conduct of cashing a forged check, the additional element of the attempted fraud offense that the writing have a value over $250 was not sufficiently material to preclude the conclusion that the forgery offense was subsumed within the attempted forgery offense.State v. Lee, 2009-NMCA-075, 146 N.M. 605, 213 P.3d 509, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-006, 146 N.M. 733, 215 P.3d 42.\n\nMultiple documents.— Where defendant signed multiple documents in connection with the refinancing of the marital home without his wife's permission or knowledge, the defendant's conduct was one continuous action rather than three distinct acts with respect to each closing document and constituted one act of forgery.State v. Turner, 2007-NMCA-105, 142 N.M. 460, 166 P.3d 1114, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-008, 142 N.M. 434, 166 P.3d 1088.\n\nMultiple prosecutions not double jeopardy.— Where charge of violation of former law relating to passing of forged evidence of debt of government, or of banking institution, was dismissed for variance on grounds that the forged instrument was not a document evidencing an indebtedness of a banking institution, and defendant was subsequently charged and convicted of passing the same forged bill of exchange with intent to defraud in violation of statute relating to uttering of forged document, his plea of double jeopardy was without merit as for double jeopardy, the test in determining whether the offenses charged are the same is whether the facts offered in support of one charge would sustain a conviction of the other, and if either information requires the proof of facts to support a conviction which the other does not, the offenses are not the same and a plea of double jeopardy is unavailing.Owens v. Abram, 1954-NMSC-096, 58 N.M. 682, 274 P.2d 630, cert. denied, 348 U.S. 917, 75 S. Ct. 300, 99 L. Ed. 719 (1955);see alsoOwens v. Swope, 227 F.2d 796 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 917, 75 S. Ct. 300, 99 L. Ed. 719 (1955).\n\nConviction for same facts under different theories constituted double jeopardy.— Defendant's conviction on two separate counts of forgery on the same check, the only difference between the two counts being the theory of forgery charged, constituted double jeopardy. Although different subsections of this section provide for alternative means of prosecution, the legislature intended only one conviction for each forgery related to the same facts involving the same check.State v. Orgain, 1993-NMCA-006, 115 N.M. 123, 847 P.2d 1377, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 145, 848 P.2d 531.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Confusing Law of Criminal Intent in New Mexico,\" see 5 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. Receiving stolen property means intentionally to receive, retain or dispose of stolen property knowing that it has been stolen or believing it has been stolen, unless the property is received, retained or disposed of with intent to restore it to the owner.\n\nB. The requisite knowledge or belief that property has been stolen is presumed in the case of a dealer who:\n\n(1) is found in possession or control of property stolen from two or more persons on separate occasions;\n\n(2) acquires stolen property for a consideration that the dealer knows is far below the property's reasonable value. A dealer shall be presumed to know the fair market value of the property in which the dealer deals; or\n\n(3) is found in possession or control of five or more items of property stolen within one year prior to the time of the incident charged pursuant to this section.\n\nC. For the purposes of this section:\n\n(1) \"dealer\" means a person in the business of buying or selling goods or commercial merchandise; and\n\n(2) \"stolen property\" means any property acquired by theft, larceny, fraud, embezzlement, robbery or armed robbery.\n\nD. Whoever commits receiving stolen property when the value of the property is two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or less is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nE. Whoever commits receiving stolen property when the value of the property is over two hundred fifty dollars ($250) but not more than five hundred dollars ($500) is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nF. Whoever commits receiving stolen property when the value of the property is over five hundred dollars ($500) but not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nG. Whoever commits receiving stolen property when the value of the property is over two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) but not more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) is guilty of a third degree felony.\n\nH. Whoever commits receiving stolen property when the value of the property exceeds twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) is guilty of a second degree felony.\n\nI. Whoever commits receiving stolen property when the property is a firearm is guilty of a fourth degree felony when its value is less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500).\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-16-11, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 16-11; 1969, ch. 171, § 2; 1972, ch. 77, § 1; 1975, ch. 232, § 1; 1983, ch. 253, § 1; 1987, ch. 121, § 5; 2006, ch. 29, § 7.\n\nCross references.— For failure to show proper authority, hides and pelts of cattle or sheep killed being evidence of larceny or receiving stolen property,see77-17-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor evidentiary rule regarding presumptions in criminal cases,seeRule 11-302 NMRA.\n\nThe 2006 amendment,effective July 1, 2006, increased the value of the property in Subsection D from $100 or less to $250 or less; increased the value of the property in Subsection E from more than $100 but less than $250 to more than $250 but less than $500; increased the value of the property in Subsection F from more than $250 to more than $500.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, added present Subsections E and H, while redesignating former Subsections E, F and G as present Subsections F, G and I.\n\nThe 1983 amendment,effective June 17, 1983, in Subsection C, divided the formerly undivided language into an introductory paragraph and Paragraph (1), added \"and\" at the end of Paragraph (1) and added Paragraph (2).\n\nI. IN GENERAL.\n\nUnit of prosecution.— A defendant's possession of a stolen firearm is a separate offense from simultaneous possession of other stolen items.State v. Watkins, 2008-NMCA-060, 144 N.M. 66, 183 P.3d 951, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-003, 143 N.M. 681, 180 P.3d 1180.\n\nThe purpose of Subsection B was not to create a separate crime where several items of property, including a firearm or firearms, were stolen or received together with other stolen property, but was to increase the penalty for the offense where a firearm was the subject of the theft or receiving of stolen property regardless of the value of the firearm.State v. Smith, 1983-NMCA-077, 100 N.M. 352, 670 P.2d 963,overruled byState v. Watkins, 2008-NMCA-060, 144 N.M. 66, 183 P.3d 951.\n\nEvidence that a defendant was in possession of numerous items of recently stolen personal property, wrongfully taken from different owners at different times, gives rise to a reasonable inference that defendant knew the property was stolen.State v. Smith, 1983-NMCA-077, 100 N.M. 352, 670 P.2d 963,overruled byState v. Watkins, 2008-NMCA-060, 144 N.M. 66, 183 P.3d 951.\n\nValidity.— Even if Subsection B renders this section partially invalid, as trial court had held, Subsection A is valid absent Subsection B.State v. Elam, 1974-NMCA-075, 86 N.M. 595, 526 P.2d 189, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 593, 526 P.2d 187.\n\nSection inapplicable to embezzled property.— In the absence of a statutory provision which expressly declares the offense of embezzlement to be embraced within the offense of larceny, the crime of receiving stolen property, knowing it to have been stolen, does not include property which was embezzled.State v. Bryant, 1982-NMCA-178, 99 N.M. 149, 655 P.2d 161 (decided under prior law).\n\nII. MULTIPLE PROSECUTIONS.\n\nMultiple charges.— Even where only one building is burglarized, multiple burglary charges are proper when the security interests of multiple victims are involved.State v. Soto, 2001-NMCA-098, 131 N.M. 299, 35 P.3d 304, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 64, 33 P.3d 284.\n\nReceiving not included in armed robbery.— Offense of receiving stolen property cannot be included within the offense of armed robbery.State v. Mares, 1968-NMCA-042, 79 N.M. 327, 442 P.2d 817.\n\nProsecution for armed robbery not barred.— Plaintiff who was convicted in a justice of the peace court (now replaced by magistrate courts) of the petty misdemeanor of receiving stolen property, and was later convicted in the district court of the second degree felony of armed robbery, was not placed in double jeopardy, nor was the state barred or estopped from prosecuting and convicting him for the armed robbery.State v. Gleason, 1969-NMCA-054, 80 N.M. 382, 456 P.2d 215.\n\nConviction for receiving as bar to burglary prosecution.— New Mexico cannot convict a person under one indictment or information of receiving stolen property, and then subsequently convict him under another indictment or information of burglary, if the burglary conviction is dependent upon a theft by him of the same property, and he is shown to have been the person who actually took and asported the property during the burglarious entry.State v. Gleason, 1969-NMCA-054, 80 N.M. 382, 456 P.2d 215.\n\nTheft inconsistent with receiving.— The felonious receiving of stolen property, knowing the same to have been stolen, was a substantive offense, and distinct from larceny. Where evidence showed defendant guilty of the theft, he could not be convicted of feloniously receiving it.Territory v. Graves, 1912-NMSC-027, 17 N.M. 241, 125 P. 604.\n\nDisposition separate from larceny.— A thief who holds on to stolen property cannot violate this section by receiving the stolen property because he cannot receive it from himself, nor can the thief violate the statute by retaining the stolen property because larceny is a continuing offense; the thief's disposition, however, is action separate from the larceny, and it is neither absurd nor unreasonable to hold that the thief violates this section when he disposes of the property that he stole.State v. Tapia, 1976-NMCA-042, 89 N.M. 221, 549 P.2d 636, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 206, 549 P.2d 284.\n\nPrinciple that one who is a thief cannot be convicted of \"receiving\" property he stole since the theft and receipt are the same act was inapplicable where defendant was convicted of \"disposing of\" property which he may also have stolen although he was acquitted of the theft.State v. Mitchell, 1974-NMCA-057, 86 N.M. 343, 524 P.2d 206.\n\nMeaning of \"disposing\" shown by legislative history.— Since the legislature is presumed to have known the law when it added the \"disposing\" provision by the 1972 amendment, and is presumed to have intended to change it, so that, even if prior law prohibited conviction for both theft and disposing of the same property the legislative history supports the view that the law has been changed.State v. Tapia, 1976-NMCA-042, 89 N.M. 221, 549 P.2d 636, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 206, 549 P.2d 284.\n\nSimultaneous possession of stolen items owned by different individualsis a single act constituting one offense.Sanchez v. State, 1982-NMSC-012, 97 N.M. 445, 640 P.2d 1325.\n\nProperty taken from more than one owner or at more than one timecannot be combined together into one count, thereby combining the values of the stolen items to increase the penalty.Sanchez v. State, 1982-NMSC-012, 97 N.M. 445, 640 P.2d 1325.\n\nThe defendant may be charged with a separate count for each separate transaction of disposal.Sanchez v. State, 1982-NMSC-012, 97 N.M. 445, 640 P.2d 1325.\n\nConviction for receipt back of property stolen.— If a thief steals property, turns that property over to someone and subsequently receives the property back from that person, a receiving conviction based on receipt of the stolen property by the thief would not be prohibited.State v. Tapia, 1976-NMCA-042, 89 N.M. 221, 549 P.2d 636, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 206, 549 P.2d 284.\n\nEach separate \"receiving\" is a separate crime.State v. Bell, 1977-NMCA-014, 90 N.M. 160, 560 P.2d 951, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 254, 561 P.2d 1347.\n\nIf defendant received the stolen pistol at a time different from the time that he received the other stolen properties, then there were two offenses for which two sentences would be imposed even though at the time of discovery defendant possessed all the stolen property involved.State v. Bell, 1977-NMCA-014, 90 N.M. 160, 560 P.2d 951, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 254, 561 P.2d 1347.\n\nDual prosecutions alleging different ownership of same property.— A former acquittal under an indictment for buying and receiving stolen property, charged to be the property of A, was no bar to a prosecution for buying and receiving the same property charged to be the property of B. This was true where difference in name of owner of property was \"railroad\" and \"railway.\"State v. Jacoby, 1919-NMSC-012, 25 N.M. 224, 180 P. 462.\n\nIII. ELEMENTS OF OFFENSE.\n\nPurpose.— An obvious purpose of this section was to inhibit the movement and disposition of stolen property, and the holding that the section applies to a thief who disposes of stolen property is consistent with that purpose.State v. Tapia, 1976-NMCA-042, 89 N.M. 221, 549 P.2d 636, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 206, 549 P.2d 284.\n\nMeaning of \"dispose\".— The ordinary meaning of the language \"dispose of stolen property\" is to transfer, relinquish or get rid of stolen property, which language does not show an intent to exclude the thief from the prohibition against disposing of stolen property.State v. Tapia, 1976-NMCA-042, 89 N.M. 221, 549 P.2d 636, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 206, 549 P.2d 284.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of \"dispose\" is \"to transfer, relinquish or get rid of;\" thus, when the defendant gave stolen money to friends, he transferred it to them.State v. Hernandez, 2003-NMCA-131, 134 N.M. 510, 79 P.3d 1118, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-002, 134 N.M. 723, 82 P.3d 533.\n\nMoney is \"property\".The legislature intended that \"property\" include \"anything of value;\" common sense supports the conclusion that \"anything of value\" includes money.State v. Hernandez, 2003-NMCA-131, 134 N.M. 510, 79 P.3d 1118, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-002, 134 N.M. 723, 82 P.3d 533.\n\nSeveral methods of committing offense.— Prior to 1972 amendment, this section provided four methods by which offense could be committed, namely, buying, procuring, receiving or concealing stolen property; proof of any one of these methods, coupled with requisite knowledge, was sufficient to sustain a conviction.State v. Carlton, 1971-NMCA-019, 82 N.M. 537, 484 P.2d 757, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 534, 484 P.2d 754.\n\nThis section contemplates that a person may commit \"receiving stolen property\" in one of three ways. The property may be \"received,\" or the property may be \"retained,\" or the property may be \"disposed\" of by a defendant. Proof of any one of these methods, coupled with the requisite knowledge, is sufficient to sustain a conviction.Sanchez v. State, 1982-NMSC-012, 97 N.M. 445, 640 P.2d 1325.\n\nActual theft and knowledge thereof required.— To establish the crime of receiving and concealing stolen property it is incumbent upon the state to prove that the property in this case was stolen; and that the accused received the property with knowledge that they were stolen.State v. Zarafonetis, 1970-NMCA-064, 81 N.M. 674, 472 P.2d 388, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 669, 472 P.2d 383.\n\nKnowledge required.— To constitute the crime of receiving stolen goods, it was essential that accused have knowledge that goods were stolen.State v. Floyd, 1918-NMSC-057, 24 N.M. 31, 172 P. 188.\n\nLost property not \"stolen property\".— Defendant could not be charged with receiving stolen property based on his possession of a lost traveler's check.State v. Carbajal, 2001-NMCA-015, 130 N.M. 284, 24 P.3d 316,rev'd on other grounds, 2002-NMSC-019, 132 N.M. 326, 48 P.3d 64.\n\nSpecific intent is not essential elementof the crime of receiving stolen property.State v. Viscarra, 1972-NMCA-125, 84 N.M. 217, 501 P.2d 261.\n\n\"Dishonest intent\" is not essential element.— \"Dishonest intent\" is not an element of the statutory crime of receiving stolen property.State v. Viscarra, 1972-NMCA-125, 84 N.M. 217, 501 P.2d 261.\n\nNature of presumption herein.— Rule 303(c), N.M.R. Evid. (now Rule 11-302 NMRA), abolishes \"true\" presumptions in criminal cases and puts the presumptions found in Subsection B of this section into the category of permissible inference, so that that subsection must be read to say that requisite knowledge or belief that property has been stolen may be, rather than is, presumed to exist upon proof of the basic facts.State v. Jones, 1975-NMCA-078, 88 N.M. 110, 537 P.2d 1006, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nIV. EVIDENCE.\n\nPossession not inferred solely from access.— When persons other than the defendant had equal or greater access to the place where the illicit goods were discovered, possession may not be inferred solely from defendant's access. Something more is necessary to establish a link between the items and the defendant before the jury can properly infer that defendant could control the items.State v. Sizemore, 1993-NMCA-079, 115 N.M. 753, 858 P.2d 420, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 709, 858 P.2d 85.\n\nCircumstantial evidence of guilty knowledge.— Guilty knowledge is rarely susceptible of direct and positive proof and generally can be established only through circumstantial evidence.State v. Zarafonetis, 1970-NMCA-064, 81 N.M. 674, 472 P.2d 388, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 669, 472 P.2d 383.\n\nUnless a defendant admits knowledge of the fact that goods he has received are stolen, this knowledge, of necessity, must be established by circumstantial evidence.State v. Lindsey, 1969-NMCA-121, 81 N.M. 173, 464 P.2d 903, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 140, 464 P.2d 559, and cert. denied, 398 U.S. 904, 90 S. Ct. 1692, 26 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1970).\n\nExclusion of reasonable hypotheses of innocence.— Where circumstantial evidence alone is relied upon for a conviction such evidence must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused upon any rational theory and incapable of explanation upon any reasonable hypothesis of the defendant's innocence.State v. Zarafonetis, 1970-NMCA-064, 81 N.M. 674, 472 P.2d 388, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 669, 472 P.2d 383.\n\nMere presence insufficient.— Although defendant was present in the house where the stolen bits were found, his presence alone is insufficient evidence on which to base a conviction.State v. Browder, 1971-NMCA-150, 83 N.M. 238, 490 P.2d 680.\n\nMere possession insufficient.— Mere possession of recently stolen property is not sufficient to warrant conviction on a charge of receiving stolen property, but possession, if not satisfactorily explained, is a circumstance to be taken into consideration with all of the other facts and circumstances in the case in determining guilt or innocence.State v. Follis, 1960-NMSC-074, 67 N.M. 222, 354 P.2d 521;State v. Olloway, 1980-NMCA-119, 95 N.M. 167, 619 P.2d 843.\n\nInference of possession or knowlege.— Although knowledge that the property is stolen may be circumstantially proved by unexplained possession, knowledge should not be inferred from possession or possession from knowledge without having some basis in fact for the initial inference.State v. Sizemore, 1993-NMCA-079, 115 N.M. 753, 858 P.2d 420, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 709, 858 P.2d 85.\n\nPossession of stolen property is circumstance to be consideredin determining whether the offense has been committed.State v. Elam, 1974-NMCA-075, 86 N.M. 595, 526 P.2d 189, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 593, 526 P.2d 187.\n\nFalse explanation of possession.— Any false explanation of possession of stolen property is a circumstance indicative of guilt.State v. Elam, 1974-NMCA-075, 86 N.M. 595, 526 P.2d 189, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 593, 526 P.2d 187.\n\nManner of purchase and sale.— Evidence that defendant had the stolen goods in his possession within a few days after the theft, and both purchased and sold them at prices disproportionately low in comparison with their value, directing that the check in payment of the goods be written so as to exclude his name from the transaction, met the test of substantiality and justified the inference that the goods were received by defendant with knowledge that they were stolen.State v. Zarafonetis, 1970-NMCA-064, 81 N.M. 674, 472 P.2d 388, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 669, 472 P.2d 383.\n\nConcealment and falsifying.— Evidence that defendant used different names in operating his business, that he used an embosser to obliterate the seals on the stolen books and that he told different stories about his acquisition of the stolen property was sufficient, even apart from evidence of possession, to sustain a conviction under this section.State v. Elam, 1974-NMCA-075, 86 N.M. 595, 526 P.2d 189, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 593, 526 P.2d 187.\n\nEvidence of value.— The victim's testimony of the value of the stolen items, together with photographic and physical exhibits of the items was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that the market value of the items possessed by defendant exceeded $500.State v. Archuleta, 2012-NMCA-007, 269 P.3d 924, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-012.\n\nMotel manager's testimony that he was familiar with the value of the television sets that are sold to motels and testified that a used set like the one involved was worth between $150 and $200 was competent and meets the substantial evidence test.State v. Williams, 1972-NMCA-011, 83 N.M. 477, 493 P.2d 962.\n\nFacsimile of bill of sale.— Introduction of a photocopy of a bill of sale for an electric typewriter sold by defendant to a witness, the original of which was claimed to have been lost, was not error, despite fact that counsel for defendant speculated the original might have been signed \"(owner's name) by (defendant).\"State v. Chacon, 1969-NMCA-112, 80 N.M. 799, 461 P.2d 932.\n\nCredibility and weight of evidence for jury.— The jury was not required to accept a suggested source of acquisition of television set, disregarding all the evidence which supported a finding that defendant knew the set was stolen, since it was for the jury to weigh the evidence and pass on the credibility of the witness.State v. Lindsey, 1969-NMCA-121, 81 N.M. 173, 464 P.2d 903, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 140, 464 P.2d 559, and cert. denied, 398 U.S. 904, 90 S. Ct. 1692, 26 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1970).\n\nReview of evidence on appeal.— In considering the question whether defendant knew property was stolen, the court will view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, resolving all conflicts therein and indulging all permissible inferences in favor of the verdict of conviction of receiving and concealing stolen goods.State v. Zarafonetis, 1970-NMCA-064, 81 N.M. 674, 472 P.2d 388, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 669, 472 P.2d 383.\n\nV. PROCEDURE.\n\nVenue proper.— Venue was properly laid in county where concealment of stolen riding equipment occurred.State v. Carlton, 1971-NMCA-019, 82 N.M. 537, 484 P.2d 757, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 534, 484 P.2d 754.\n\nAllegation of ownership was essential in indictmentfor buying and receiving stolen property, and a departure in the proof from the allegation in the indictment was necessarily fatal to the proceedings.State v. Jacoby, 1919-NMSC-012, 25 N.M. 224, 180 P. 462.\n\nAllegation of source unnecessary.— It was not necessary that indictment set out from whom the stolen goods were received.Territory v. Claypool, 1903-NMSC-002, 11 N.M. 568, 71 P. 463.\n\nCharging in alternative.— An indictment which charged buying, receiving or concealing in the alternative, through the use of the word \"or,\" was established by proof of any one of them, although they were charged in a single count.Territory v. Neatherlin, 1906-NMSC-023, 13 N.M. 491, 85 P. 1044.\n\nIndictment adequate.— Where the indictment charged defendant with receiving and concealing stolen property contrary to statutory provisions, further alleging that: \"On diverse dates between March 20, 1965, and the 19th day of March, 1968 . . . [the defendant] did buy, procure, receive, or conceal things of value knowing the same to have been stolen or acquired by fraud or embezzlement\" the indictment was in substantially the form prescribed by statute, and, insofar as form is concerned, no greater degree of conformity was required.State v. Lindsey, 1969-NMCA-121, 81 N.M. 173, 464 P.2d 903, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 140, 464 P.2d 559, and cert. denied, 398 U.S. 904, 90 S. Ct. 1692, 26 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1970).\n\nUnclear indictment to be dismissed.— Where the defendant cannot tell whether he is being charged with \"receiving,\" \"retaining\" or \"disposing\" of stolen property, nor can it be determined whether the charges are being \"stacked\" to enhance the penalty, the indictment is faulty and must be dismissed.Sanchez v. State, 1982-NMSC-012, 97 N.M. 445, 640 P.2d 1325.\n\nEffect of variance.— In prosecution for receiving and concealing stolen property, alleged variance between all the evidence and the indictment was not ground for acquittal, as court could at any time cause the indictment to be amended, nor did defense counsel's failure to object thereto establish his ineffectiveness.State v. Chacon, 1969-NMCA-112, 80 N.M. 799, 461 P.2d 932.\n\nUse of conjunctive rather than disjunctive.— Where, through error, the information and the court's instructions defined the offense of buying, receiving or aiding in the concealment of stolen property conjunctively rather than disjunctively as in the statute, the defendant was not aided thereby since there was substantial evidence to show that he was guilty of all three offenses.State v. Russell, 1933-NMSC-018, 37 N.M. 131, 19 P.2d 742.\n\nInstruction regarding type of intent.— Where on appeal it was contended an error occurred for the district court to give a general intent instruction without instructing the jury that it did not apply to a specific intent crime, because the instruction substantially followed the applicable law, there was no fundamental error.State v. Gee, 2004-NMCA-042, 135 N.M. 408, 89 P.3d 80, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-003, 135 N.M. 261, 88 P.3d 261.\n\nIntent-to-return defense.— For the intent-to-return defense to apply, the stolen goods should never have been held for any purpose other than to return the goods to the owner.State v. Lopez, 1990-NMCA-016, 109 N.M. 578, 787 P.2d 1261.\n\nThe prospect of a reward does not defeat the intent-to-return defense.State v. Lopez, 1990-NMCA-016, 109 N.M. 578, 787 P.2d 1261.\n\nThe Uniform Jury Instructions do not preclude an instruction on the intent-to-return defense when appropriate.State v. Lopez, 1990-NMCA-016, 109 N.M. 578, 787 P.2d 1261.\n\nDefendant was entitled to an instruction on the intent-to-return defense, where reasonable doubt could arise from the possibility that defendant's involvement consisted of only awareness of the burglary, knowledge of where the goods were being kept, use of reward money from an investigator to purchase the goods from those holding them, and delivery of the goods to the investigator.State v. Lopez, 1990-NMCA-016, 109 N.M. 578, 787 P.2d 1261.\n\nWaiver of error in instruction.— Error committed by trial court in instructing the jury that requisite knowledge must, rather than may, be presumed upon proof of basic facts, which was not objected to, was waived and did not constitute fundamental error.State v. Jones, 1975-NMCA-078, 88 N.M. 110, 537 P.2d 1006, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Confusing Law of Criminal Intent in New Mexico,\" see 5 N.M.L.

Niehaus, 1940-NMSC-034, 44 N.M. 342, 102 P.2d 659.\n\nCriminal intent.— While Laws 1929, ch. 46 (former 40-21-43 to 40-21-45, 1953 Comp.) did not specifically provide that the prohibited acts of a person, obtaining possession of personal property from its owner by a conditional sales contract and selling it without the consent of such owner, before securing title, be done with criminal intent, the act was manifestly designed to protect the interest of such owner, and the wrong inhered in delaying or defrauding him of his right to repossess his property if the conditional sales contract was breached by the buyer, and the specific conduct charged must have been actuated by such intent, to constitute a crime under the statute.State v. Shedoudy, 1941-NMSC-044, 45 N.M. 516, 118 P.2d 280.\n\nCriminal intent negatived.— Where mortgagor removed mortgaged cattle to another state for grazing with oral consent on part of the mortgagee, mortgagor did not have the requisite criminal intent in moving the cattle to constitute offense of removing and concealing mortgaged cattle in violation of former law.Howard v. Singleton, 1950-NMSC-067, 55 N.M. 8, 225 P.2d 697.\n\nRemoval and concealment after repossession.— Where the evidence showed that the title holder of an automobile had already repossessed it because of defendant's default at the time defendant took it from garage and concealed it, defendant's taking and concealment, without the consent and knowledge of the title holder, would constitute a crime, but not the crime of unlawfully taking, carrying away and concealing personal property possession of which was obtained under a conditional sales contract.State v. Shedoudy, 1944-NMSC-042, 48 N.M. 354, 151 P.2d 57.\n\nFailure to sell repossessed collateral not treated as election under 55-9-505 NMSA 1978.— Where a decrease in inventory constitutes a willful and malicious conversion of collateral and a violation of this section, failing to sell the repossessed collateral will not be treated as an election under 55-9-505 NMSA 1978 to retain the collateral in satisfaction of the obligation.With v. Amador, 596 F.2d 428 (10th Cir. 1979).\n\nSale of borrowed motorcycle.— Where defendant sold a motorcycle to the complaining witness, subsequently borrowed it back, and then sold it to a third person, he was guilty of embezzlement; this section would have been applicable if the jury had determined that dealings between the defendant and complaining witness amounted to a secured transaction, but jury necessarily determined they did not.State v. Gregg, 1972-NMCA-001, 83 N.M. 397, 492 P.2d 1260, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 562, 494 P.2d 975.\n\nArgument on value improperly refused.— On charge that buyer under a conditional sales contract obtained possession of an automobile of a finance company and unlawfully took, carried away and concealed such automobile of the value of more than $100 while its title was in such finance company and without its consent, it was error to refuse to permit accused's counsel to argue whether such value had been established by the evidence.State v.

      "text": "A. Shoplifting consists of one or more of the following acts:\n\n(1) willfully taking possession of merchandise with the intention of converting it without paying for it;\n\n(2) willfully concealing merchandise with the intention of converting it without paying for it;\n\n(3) willfully altering a label, price tag or marking upon merchandise with the intention of depriving the retailer of all or some part of the value of it; or\n\n(4) willfully transferring merchandise from the container in or on which it is displayed to another container with the intention of depriving the retailer of all or some part of the value of it.\n\nB. Whoever commits shoplifting when the value of the merchandise shoplifted:\n\n(1) is two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or less is guilty of a petty misdemeanor;\n\n(2) is more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250) but not more than five hundred dollars ($500) is guilty of a misdemeanor;\n\n(3) is more than five hundred dollars ($500) but not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) is guilty of a fourth degree felony;\n\n(4) is more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) but not more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) is guilty of a third degree felony; or\n\n(5) is more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) is guilty of a second degree felony.\n\nC. Charges under this section shall be based on the aggregated retail market value of merchandise shoplifted from a single retailer at a single location in an amount specified in Subsection B of this section. Conduct that may form the basis for a charge under this section may be used or considered for an organized retail crime offense pursuant to Section 2 [30-16-20.1 NMSA 1978] of this 2023 act; provided that an individual charged with both a violation of this section and organized retail crime shall not be punished for both offenses.\n\nD. When an individual has engaged in shoplifting more than once over a ninety-day period, whether committed at one or more retailers, the prosecution may charge the individual under this section based on either the aggregated retail market value of merchandise shoplifted from a single retailer at a single location or in a single charge based on the aggregated retail market value of merchandise shoplifted. Venue for prosecutions based on an aggregated retail market value of merchandise stolen shall be proper in any county in which merchandise was shoplifted.\n\nE. Aggravated shoplifting consists of unlawfully assaulting or striking at another with a deadly weapon immediately after an act of shoplifting in order to retain possession of stolen property or to effect an escape from the scene of an act of shoplifting. Whoever commits aggravated shoplifting is guilty of a third degree felony.\n\nF. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"aggregated retail market value\" means the total combined value of all merchandise involved at the price at which the merchandise would ordinarily be sold by the retailer with the legitimate sale or distribution of the item; and\n\n(2) \"retailer\" means a person or business that sells or facilitates the sale of merchandise to the public for use or consumption rather than for resale.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-16-20, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 5, § 2; 1969, ch. 24, § 1; 1987, ch. 121, § 8; 2006, ch. 29, § 10; 2023, ch. 194, § 1.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, created the crime of aggravated shoplifting, revised provisions related to the value of merchandise shoplifted, provided that when an individual has engaged in shoplifting more than once over a ninety-day period, whether committed at one or more retailers, the prosecution may charge the individual based on either the aggregated retail market value of merchandise shoplifted from a single retailer at a single location or in a single charged based on the aggregated retail market value of merchandise shoplifted, provided that venue for prosecutions based on aggregated retail market value of merchandise stolen shall be proper in any county in which merchandise was shoplifted, and defined \"aggregated retail market value\" and \"retailer\" as used in this section; in the section heading, added \"aggravated shoplifting\"; in Subsection C, deleted \"An individual charged with a violation of this section shall not be charged with a separate or additional offense arising out of the same transaction\" and added \"Charges under this section shall be based on the aggregated retail market value of merchandise shoplifted from a single retailer at a single location in an amount specified in Subsection B of this section. Conduct that may form the basis for a charge under this section may be used or considered for an organized retail crime offense pursuant to Section 2 of this 2023 act; provided that an individual charged with both a violation of this section and organized retail crime shall not be punished for both offenses.\"; and added Subsections D through F.\n\nThe 2006 amendment,effective July 1, 2006, increased the value of the merchandise in Paragraph (1) of Subsection B from $100 or less to $250 or less; increased the value of the services, food, entertainment or accommodation in Paragraph (2) of Subsection B from more than $100 but less than $250 to more than $250 but less than $500; and increased the value of the thing embezzled or converted in Paragraph (3) of Subsection B from more than $250 to more than $500.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, substituted \"one hundred dollars ($100) or less\" for \"not more than one hundred dollars ($100)\" in Subsection B(1), redesignated former Subsections B(2) and B(3) as present Subsections B(3) and B(4), added present Subsections B(2) and B(5), substituted \"two hundred fifty dollars ($250)\" for \"one hundred dollars ($100)\" in Subsection B(3), and inserted \"but not more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000)\" in Subsection B(4).\n\nConviction of both shoplifting and burglary.— Where the defendant illegally entered a store intending to steal bottles of liquor, took bottles of liquor and did not pay for them, and there was no separation in time or location between the defendant's intent when the defendant entered the store and when the defendant committed the theft, the burglary and the shoplifting arose out of the same transaction and the conviction of the defendant for both shoplifting and burglary was prohibited by this section.State v. Ramirez, 2008-NMCA-165, 145 N.M. 367, 198 P.3d 866, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-011, 145 N.M. 531, 202 P.3d 124.\n\nProof of market value.— In the absence of evidence that retail price of $119.97 did not accurately reflect the value of the merchandise in the retail market, evidence of that price was sufficient for the jury to determine there was a market value of more than $100, despite a showing that the wholesale price was only $84.97.State v. Richardson, 1976-NMCA-021, 89 N.M. 30, 546 P.2d 878.\n\nA necklace's ticket price of $600 was not sufficient to establish its market value since there was evidence that such jewelry was never sold at the ticket price and that the store made its full anticipated profit selling such jewelry at 50% to 60% off such price.State v. Contreras, 1996-NMCA-045, 121 N.M. 550, 915 P.2d 306, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 499, 914 P.2d 636.\n\nSufficient evidence of market value.— Where defendant was charged with shoplifting over $500 for taking a television and the manager of the store testified that the retail price of the television at the time it was taken was $576, that the price had changed after the theft and had a retail price of $478 six months after the theft, that the store listed the television for $498 on its website, and that the store did not price match its website prices or engage in reference pricing in order to late discount to a lower sale price, there was sufficient evidence that the value of the television exceeded $500.State v. Cofer, 2011-NMCA-085, 150 N.M. 483, 261 P.3d 1115, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-007, 268 P.3d 46.\n\nSufficient evidence of value of merchandise stolen.— In defendant's trial for shoplifting and conspiracy to commit shoplifting, there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of shoplifting of merchandise with a value of more than $500 where the evidence in the form of testimony and a store-generated training receipt that the value of the merchandise recovered from defendant and his accomplice was $556.39, without tax.State v. Gallegos, 2016-NMCA-076, cert. denied.\n\n\"Value\" as \"market value\".— Although New Mexico's property crime statutes do not state how value is to be determined, the decisions have used the term \"market value\" as the test.State v. Richardson, 1976-NMCA-021, 89 N.M. 30, 546 P.2d 878.\n\n\"Market value\" of merchandise does not include the New Mexico gross receipts taxfor the purpose of fixing criminal penalties under this section.Tunnell v. State, 1983-NMSC-013, 99 N.M. 446, 659 P.2d 898.\n\nTax not included in determining item's \"value\" unless included in price.— The amount of gross receipts tax which could have been imposed on a regular sale of merchandise cannot be included for purposes of determining the \"value\" of the shoplifted item under this section, unless the total advertised retail or actual market price of the merchandise which was shoplifted included the amount of New Mexico gross receipts tax applicable to that particular item of merchandise.Tunnell v. State, 1983-NMSC-013, 99 N.M. 446, 659 P.2d 898.\n\nValuation of property taken by persons working together.— Since the defendant and his cohort working together took merchandise from the same store at the same time, the jury properly attributed to the defendant all the merchandise taken, regardless of in whose bag it was found.State v. Armijo, 1995-NMCA-115, 120 N.M. 702, 905 P.2d 740, cert. denied, 120 N.M. 636, 904 P.2d 1061.\n\nSentencing under habitual offender statute.— A sentence of eight years' imprisonment, imposed under the habitual offender statute against a defendant convicted for the fifth time on felony shoplifting charges, was not so disproportionate as to require reversal as cruel and unusual punishment under the New Mexico Constitution, notwithstanding facts that three of the convictions were over 15 years old, and the latest charge was only $3 over the minimum threshold for felony shoplifting.State v. Rueda, 1999-NMCA-033, 126 N.M. 738, 975 P.2d 351, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 391, 981 P.2d 1209.\n\nConspiracy does not arise out of same transaction as shoplifting.— A charge of conspiracy does not arise out of the same transaction which results in an indictment for shoplifting, and thus cannot be dismissed as in violation of a statute prohibiting the charging of separate or additional offense if it arises out of the same transaction, notwithstanding proof of the subsequent shoplifting may also tend to circumstantially prove the conspiracy charge.State v. Leyba, 1979-NMCA-105, 93 N.M. 366, 600 P.2d 312.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Survey of New Mexico Law, 1979-80: Criminal Law and Procedure,\" see 11 N.M.L. Rev. 85 (1981).\n\nAm.

Matamoros, 1976-NMCA-028, 89 N.M. 125, 547 P.2d 1167.\n\nInstructions improper.— Instructions that one who willfully conceals merchandise on his person shall be \"prima facie presumed\" to have concealed it with intent of converting it without paying for it, and that concealment on one's person or his belongings is \"prima facie evidence\" of willful concealment, violated Rule 303(c), N.M.R.

Sally Beauty Supply, Inc., 2011-NMCA-100, 150 N.M. 636, 264 P.3d 732, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 903.\n\nMeaning of \"willfully concealed\".— When merchandise is concealed in the sense that it is not in plain sight, there must also be circumstances which reflect that the purpose of the concealment is adverse to the store owner's right to be paid for the merchandise before a conclusion can be made that the merchandise was \"willfully concealed\" under Section 30-16-23 NMSA 1978.Holguin v.

Sally Beauty Supply, Inc., 2011-NMCA-100, 150 N.M. 636, 264 P.3d 732, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 903.\n\nNo reasonable cause to detain.— In suit for false imprisonment and defamation, where employee of self-service store testified that he saw one of two women plaintiffs who were shopping together remove the sticker from a box of merchandise and put the box in her purse, the women denied placing the box in the purse, and the box, absent its sticker price tag, was found some 15 feet away from its accustomed place after the release of plaintiffs by the police officers who had detained them, the women's denial placed the evidence as to probable or reasonable cause for believing the women were unlawfully taking goods held for sale into conflict, which conflict the trial court, sitting as trier of fact, with ample support, resolved in favor of the women plaintiffs.Stienbaugh v. Payless Drug Store, Inc., 1965-NMSC-033, 75 N.M. 118, 401 P.2d 104.\n\nDefamatory statements in course of investigation.— Even assuming there had existed a privilege in pursuing investigation of supposed shoplifting, whether defamatory statement made by employee in presence of both employees and patrons of the store was made in the exercise of that privilege, was a question for the trier of facts.Stienbaugh v.

Theft of identity consists of willfully obtaining, recording or transferring personal identifying information of another person without the authorization or consent of that person and with the intent to defraud that person or another or with the intent to sell or distribute the information to another for an illegal purpose.\n\nB. Obtaining identity by electronic fraud consists of knowingly and willfully soliciting, requesting or taking any action by means of a fraudulent electronic communication with intent to obtain the personal identifying information of another.\n\nC. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"fraudulent electronic communication\" means a communication by a person that is an electronic mail message, web site or any other use of the internet that contains fraudulent, false, fictitious or misleading information that depicts or includes the name, logo, web site address, email address, postal address, telephone number or any other identifying information of a business, organization or state agency, to which the person has no legitimate claim of right;\n\n(2) \"personal identifying information\" means information that alone or in conjunction with other information identifies a person, including the person's name, address, telephone number, driver's license number, social security number, date of birth, biometric data, place of employment, mother's maiden name, demand deposit account number, checking or savings account number, credit card or debit card number, personal identification number, electronic identification code, automated or electronic signature, passwords or any other numbers or information that can be used to obtain access to a person's financial resources, obtain identification, act as identification or obtain goods or services; and\n\n(3) \"biometric data\" means data, such as finger, voice, retina or iris prints or deoxyribonucleic acid, that capture, represent or enable the reproduction of unique physical attributes of a person.\n\nD. Whoever commits theft of identity is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nE. Whoever commits obtaining identity by electronic fraud is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nF. Prosecution pursuant to this section shall not prevent prosecution pursuant to any other provision of the law when the conduct also constitutes a violation of that other provision.\n\nG. In a prosecution brought pursuant to this section, the theft of identity or obtaining identity by electronic fraud shall be considered to have been committed in the county:\n\n(1) where the person whose identifying information was appropriated, obtained or sought resided at the time of the offense; or\n\n(2) in which any part of the offense took place, regardless of whether the defendant was ever actually present in the county.\n\nH. A person found guilty of theft of identity or of obtaining identity by electronic fraud shall, in addition to any other punishment, be ordered to make restitution for any financial loss sustained by a person injured as the direct result of the offense. In addition to out-of-pocket costs, restitution may include payment for costs, including attorney fees, incurred by that person in clearing the person's credit history, credit rating, criminal history or criminal charges or costs incurred in connection with a legal proceeding to satisfy a debt, lien, judgment or other obligation of that person arising as a result of the offense.\n\nI. The sentencing court shall issue written findings of fact and may issue orders as are necessary to correct public records and errors in credit reports and identifying information that contain false information as a result of the theft of identity or of obtaining identity by electronic fraud.\n\nHistory:Laws 2001, ch. 138, § 1; 2005, ch. 296, § 1; 2009, ch. 95, § 3.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection A, after \"person or another\", added the remainder of the sentence; in Paragraph (2) of Subsection C, after \"social security number\", added \"date of birth, biometric data\"; after \"place of employment\" added \"mother's\"; after \"maiden name\", deleted \"of the person's mother\", after \"personal identification number\", added \"electronic identification code, automated or electronic signature\", after \"can be used to\", added \"obtain\" and after \"person's financial resources\", added the remainder of the sentence; added Paragraph (3) of Subsection C; in Subsection H, after \"credit rating\" added \"criminal history or criminal charges\" and after \"in connection with a\", changed \"civil or administrative\" to \"legal\"; and in Subsection I, after \"necessary to correct\", changed \"a public record\" to \"public records and errors in credit reports and identifying information\".\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective July 1, 2005, added Subsection B to define the crime of obtaining identity by electronic fraud; added Subsection C(1) to define \"fraudulent electronic communication\"; changed the crime of theft of identity from a misdemeanor to a fourth degree felony in Subsection D; added Subsection E to provide that the crime of obtaining identity by electronic fraud is a fourth degree felony; added the crime of obtaining identity by electronic fraud in Subsection G; provided in Subsection G(1) that the crimes are considered to be committed in the county where the person whose identifying information was obtained or sought resided; and added the crime of obtaining identity by electronic fraud in Subsections H and I.\n\nJurisdiction to prosecute use of identity outside New Mexico.— Where defendant used the victim's identity to obtain a driver's license in Arizona, rent cars in Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia, and provide booking information upon defendant's arrest in Georgia; none of the acts of using the victim's identity occurred in New Mexico; the victim resided in New Mexico at the time of the transactions; and as a result of defendant's use of the victim's identity, the victim encountered problems trying to get a driver's license in New Mexico and victim received rental car bills in New Mexico that were incurred by defendant outside New Mexico, New Mexico had territorial jurisdiction over the offense, even if the acts were committed outside New Mexico because the crime had an effect upon the victim in New Mexico.State v. Allen, 2014-NMCA-111, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nDefendant's conviction for identity theft was preempted by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act.— Where defendant was convicted of identity theft for using another person's personal identifying information on documents he submitted to his employer during the hiring process, among which was a federal employment eligibility verification form (Form I-9) which the federal government requires employers to use to verify that an employee may lawfully work in the United States, and where defendant claimed that his conviction for identity theft was preempted by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), which makes it unlawful for an employer to knowingly hire a non-citizen or non-national who is not authorized to work in the United States, defendant's conviction was improper because IRCA expressly prohibits the use of Form I-9 except for a few enumerated purposes to verify that an individual is not an unauthorized alien, and in this case, the state used Form I-9 to prove the identity theft charge, a non-enumerated purpose. Therefore, the state's use of Form I-9 was prohibited by IRCA and defendant's identity theft conviction was preempted to the extent it was based on Form I-9. Moreover, defendant's conviction constituted fundamental error because it is unclear to what extent the jury's decision was predicated on Form I-9, as opposed to other documents relied on by the State.State v. Prieto-Lozoya, 2021-NMCA-019, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for identity theft.— Where defendant was charged with identity theft for using another person's personal identifying information on documents he submitted to his employer during the hiring process, and where the state presented evidence that defendant was not authorized to be in the United States at the time he applied for the job, that he did not apply for the job in his own name, but used the identity of someone else, that he submitted documentation, including a social security card bearing another persons' name and social security number, a permanent resident card bearing another person's name and date of birth, but with defendant's image on the card, a W-4 federal tax withholding form bearing another person's name and social security number, and a federal employment eligibility verification form bearing another person's name, date of birth and social security number, to his employer as part of the hiring process, and that defendant was not authorized to use the personal identifying information of the other person, there was sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to defraud his employer and that he committed identity theft.State v. Prieto-Lozoya, 2021-NMCA-019, cert. denied.",

      "text": "A. Fraudulent use of a credit card consists of a person obtaining anything of value, with intent to defraud, by using:\n\n(1) a credit card obtained in violation of Sections 30-16-25 through 30-16-38 NMSA 1978;\n\n(2) a credit card that is invalid, expired or revoked;\n\n(3) a credit card while fraudulently representing that the person is the cardholder named on the credit card or an authorized agent or representative of the cardholder named on the credit card; or\n\n(4) a credit card issued in the name of another person without the consent of the person to whom the card has been issued.\n\nB. Whoever commits fraudulent use of a credit card when the value of the property or service obtained is two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or less in any consecutive six-month period is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nC. Whoever commits fraudulent use of a credit card when the value of the property or service obtained is over two hundred fifty dollars ($250) but not more than five hundred dollars ($500) in any consecutive six-month period is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nD. Whoever commits fraudulent use of a credit card when the value of the property or service obtained is over five hundred dollars ($500) but not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) in any consecutive six-month period is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nE. Whoever commits fraudulent use of a credit card when the value of the property or service obtained is over two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) but not more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) in any consecutive six-month period is guilty of a third degree felony.\n\nF. Whoever commits fraudulent use of a credit card when the value of the property or service obtained is over twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) in any consecutive six-month period is guilty of a second degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-16-33, enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 239, § 9; 2006, ch. 29, § 11.\n\nThe 2006 amendment,effective July 1, 2006, provided in Subsection A that fraudulent use of a credit card consists of a person obtaining anything of value with intent to defraud by using a credit card; changed the 1953 statutory references in Paragraph (1) of Subsection A to the NMSA 1978; replaced the former Subsection B, which provided that if the value of things obtained exceeds $300 in a consecutive six months period, the offense was a third degree felony with new Subsections B through F providing separate penalties for fraudulent use of a credit card depending on the value of the property or service obtained.\n\nDefinition of credit card.— An electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card issued to a public assistance recipient is not a credit card under Section 30-16-33 NMSA 1978,State v. Martinez, 2001-NMCA-099, 131 N.M. 254, 34 P.3d 643.\n\nSection 30-16-33 NMSA 1978 is not unconstitutionally vague.State v. Castillo, 2011-NMCA-046, 149 N.M. 536, 252 P.3d 760, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-004, 150 N.M. 648, 264 P.3d 1171.\n\nDebit card.— Debit cards, which are tied to individual checking accounts, as opposed to lines of credit or guarantee of payment by the issuing bank, is not a \"credit card\" for purposes of Section 30-16-33 NMSA 1978.State v. Castillo, 2011-NMCA-046, 149 N.M. 536, 252 P.3d 760, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-004, 150 N.M. 648, 264 P.3d 1171.\n\nEach use separate offense.— Section 30-16-32 NMSA 1978 punishes each fraudulent signature. This indicates that the legislature intended to punish each use of a credit card under this section, not the continuing possession and usage of one card.State v. Salazar, 1982-NMCA-077, 98 N.M. 70, 644 P.2d 1059.\n\nSufficient evidence of conspiracy to commit fraudulent use of a credit card.— Where defendant was convicted of fourth-degree fraudulent use of a credit card (over $500) and conspiracy to commit fraudulent use of a credit card, and where defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support her conviction for conspiracy, arguing that the state did not present direct or circumstantial evidence from which the jury could determine that an agreement was reached with another person, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the jury's determination that defendant agreed with at least one other person to commit fraudulent use of a credit card where, at trial, the state admitted into evidence the receipts for nine unauthorized credit card transactions made over the course of five consecutive days and offered testimony that defendant appeared in surveillance footage conducting one of the credit card transactions and used the same job identifier for her purchase as did another unauthorized user of the credit card in a separate transaction. From this evidence, a rational jury could reasonably infer that there was some level of agreement and coordination among the users of the credit card based on the use of the same job identifier in multiple transactions, that defendant must have received the credit card from another unauthorized user of the credit card because she used the credit card to make a purchase one day after it was used in the first transaction by another person, and that defendant must have given the credit card to another person who used the credit card three more times in the two days after defendant used the credit card.State v. Herrera,2024-NMCA-025, cert. denied.\n\nConsent.— Consent is not an essential element of the crime defined in Subsection A(3) of this section.State v. Lopez, 1973-NMCA-148, 85 N.M. 742, 516 P.2d 1125.\n\nAdmissibility of related incident.— In prosecution for charging purchase on credit card belonging to another, admission of testimony of a subsequent attempt to charge additional purchases on the following day at the same store was not erroneous, as the second incident was strong evidence of defendant's intent and his plan, and the concurrence of time, place and modus operandi also tended to establish the identity of the accused.State v. Lopez, 1973-NMCA-148, 85 N.M. 742, 516 P.2d 1125.\n\nOpinion evidence on intent.— It was error to allow store employee who dealt with defendant to express opinion on whether he had reason to believe that defendant intended to defraud the establishment, but considering the strong evidence in the record, this error was not prejudicial.State v. Lopez, 1973-NMCA-148, 85 N.M. 742, 516 P.2d 1125.\n\nArrest valid.— Where arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe that person arrested had committed the crime of misusing an expired credit card, the arrest was valid.Stone v. United States, 385 F.2d 713 (10th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 391 U.S. 966, 88 S. Ct. 2038, 20 L. Ed. 2d 880 (1968).\n\nAm.

Cowley, 1968-NMCA-011, 79 N.M. 49, 439 P.2d 567, cert. denied, 79 N.M. 98, 440 P.2d 136.",
