The fact finder may consider:\n\n(1) statements made by an owner or by anyone else in control of the substance concerning the nature of the substance or its use or effect;\n\n(2) statements made to the recipient that the substance may be resold for inordinate profit;\n\n(3) whether the substance is packaged in a manner normally used for illicit controlled substances;\n\n(4) evasive tactics or actions utilized by the owner or person in control of the substance to avoid detection by law enforcement authorities;\n\n(5) prior convictions, if any, of the owner or anyone in control of the object, under state or federal law related to controlled substances or fraud; and\n\n(6) whether the physical appearance of the substance is substantially identical to a controlled substance; and\n\nE. \"manufacture\" means the production, preparation, compounding, processing, encapsulating, packaging or repackaging or labeling or relabeling as an imitation controlled substance.\n\nHistory:Laws 1983, ch. 148, § 2.\n\nAdmissibility of prior convictions under Section 31-31A-2(D)(5) NMSA 1978.— Any evidence of a prior conviction referred to in Section 31-31A-2(D)(5) NMSA 1978 must also be admissible under Rules 11-403 and 11-404 NMRA.State v. Serna, 2013-NMSC-033.\n\nAdmission of prior convictions under Section 31-31A-2(D)(5) NMSA 1978 was error.— Where defendant was charged with trafficking imitation controlled substances for selling baking soda as cocaine; pursuant to Section 31-31A-2(D)(5) NMSA 1978, the district court allowed testimony about defendant's prior criminal convictions for possession of a controlled substance and credit card fraud; and the evidence of defendant's prior convictions went solely to propensity, painting defendant as a bad character from the drug world, the convictions were inadmissible.State v. Serna, 2013-NMSC-033.",
