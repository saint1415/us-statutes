      "text": "This act [30-5A-1 to 30-5A-5 NMSA 1978] may be cited as the \"Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act\".\n\nHistory:Laws 2000, ch. 55, § 1.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2000, ch. 55 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 23, was effective on May 17, 2000, 90 days after adjournment of the legislature.\n\nCross references.— For family planning,see24-8-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor sterilization,see24-9A-1 NMSA 1978\n\nFor maternal, fetal and infant experimentation,see9A-24-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nSection partially unconstitutional (decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978).— Portions of this section which define those \"justified medical terminations\" not proscribed by Section 30-5-3 NMSA 1978 (repealed) as only those where physician used acceptable medical procedures in accredited hospitals after approval by special hospital board, and either where continuation of pregnancy would result in death or grave injury to mother, where child was likely to have grave physical or mental defects or where pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, held unconstitutional by virtue of 1973 holdings in Doe v. Bolton (410 U.S. 179, 93 S. Ct. 739, 35 L. Ed. 2d 201) and Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147).State v. Strance, 1973-NMCA-024, 84 N.M. 670, 506 P.2d 1217.\n\nThis section does not define murder, homicide or feticide (decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§ 30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978),but is concerned with the special circumstances required for abortion to be a criminal offense.State v. Willis, 1982-NMCA-151, 98 N.M. 771, 652 P.2d 1222 (specially concurring opinion).\n\nMeaning of \"abortion\" (decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§ 30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978).— The word \"abortion\" was commonly employed in law to designate the means used to procure miscarriage.State v. Grissom, 1930-NMSC-109, 35 N.M. 323, 298 P. 666.\n\nMeaning of \"justified medical termination\" (decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§ 30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978).— When limited definition of \"justified medical termination\" necessitated by court's reading of Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113) and Doe v. Bolton (410 U.S. 179) into Section 30-5-1 NMSA 1978 (repealed) is applied to this section what emerges is a criminal statute penalizing the act of performing abortions on the unconsenting, or performing an abortion on a woman under the age of 18 years without the consent of both the woman and her then living parent or guardian, or the performance of an abortion by a person who is not a physician licensed by the state.State v. Strance, 1973-NMCA-024, 84 N.M. 670, 506 P.2d 1217.\n\nProof of pregnancy (decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§ 30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978).— Although there was no direct, positive proof that on the day of the first attempted abortion the fetus was living, there was ample evidence for the jury to reasonably arrive at such a conclusion where the physician who had originally examined the woman on whom the abortion was performed testified as to the tests he had made on her and expressed the opinion that she was about two months pregnant.State v. Gutierrez, 1965-NMSC-143, 75 N.M. 580, 408 P.2d 503.\n\nCondition presumed to continue (decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§ 30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978).— Although there was proof which might be construed to the effect that it was impossible to tell whether on the day of the original abortion attempt the fetus was alive or dead, the rule in this jurisdiction is that a condition once shown to exist will be presumed to continue until the contrary is established by evidence, direct or presumptive.State v. Gutierrez, 1965-NMSC-143, 75 N.M. 580, 408 P.2d 503.\n\nEvidence of other abortions (Decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§ 30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978).— The gist of offense under Laws 1919, ch. 4, § 1 (former 40-3-1, 1953 Comp.), was intent to murder a quick child by performing an abortion upon mother; in a prosecution under that section, proof of other abortions where the child had not quickened was not relevant and should be excluded.State v. Bassett, 1921-NMSC-016, 26 N.M. 476, 194 P. 867.\n\nInstruments and drugs (decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§ 30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978).— Instruments and drugs were sufficiently connected with the accused and with the operation to make them admissible on his trial for abortion.State v. Grissom, 1930-NMSC-109, 35 N.M. 323, 298 P. 666.\n\nExhibition of instruments (decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§ 30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978).— In a prosecution for an attempted abortion, exhibition of dilator in cross-examination of accused was not error.State v. Lewis, 1932-NMSC-033, 36 N.M. 218, 12 P.2d 849.\n\nErroneous instructions on corroboration (decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§ 30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978).— In prosecution for abortion, defendant could be convicted by uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, but where court gave instruction requiring corroboration, there must be some other evidence in the record tending to show that defendant took part in the commission of the crime.State v. Gutierrez, 1965-NMSC-143, 75 N.M. 580, 408 P.2d 503.\n\nEnforceability of section (decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§ 30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978).— Under current law, Section 30-5-2 NMSA 1978 (repealed) is entirely enforceable, and this section and Section 30-5-1 NMSA 1978 (repealed) are enforceable only to the extent that they criminalize and punish the act of performing an abortion on an unconsenting woman, or the performance of an abortion by a person who is not a physician licensed by the state of New Mexico. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-19.\n\nParental consent provision (decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§ 30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978).— New Mexico's parental consent provision may become enforceable either through legislative enactment of amendments to existing law or, under certain circumstances, through modification of current federal abortion jurisprudence. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-19.\n\nConsent of husband not required (decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§ 30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978).— Consent of the husband of a woman over the age of 18 is not required when she requests a justified medical termination of her pregnancy. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-91.\n\nMarried woman under eighteen(decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§ 30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978).— A woman under eighteen, but lawfully married, can request a justified medical termination of her pregnancy without the consent of her parent or guardian, or of her husband. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-91.\n\nDivorced or separated woman (decided prior to the repeal of the criminal abortion statutes, §§ 30-5-1 to 30-5-3 NMSA 1978).— A married woman who subsequently is divorced or separated, regardless of age, is an emancipated person who is entitled to determine herself, without the consent of any other person, whether she will request medical termination of her pregnancy hereunder. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-91.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"New Mexico's 1969 Criminal Abortion Law,\" see 10 Nat. Resources J. 591 (1970).\n\nFor article, \"Rape Law: The Need for Reform,\" see 5 N.M.L.
