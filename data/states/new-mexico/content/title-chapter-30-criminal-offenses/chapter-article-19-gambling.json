As used in this subsection, \"consideration\" means anything of pecuniary value required to be paid to the promoter in order to participate in a gambling or gaming enterprise.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-19-1, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 19-1; 1965, ch. 37, § 1; 1985, ch. 108, § 1; 1995, ch. 155, § 37; 1997, ch. 190, § 66; 2002, ch. 102, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For the Indian Gaming Compact,see11-13-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2002 amendment,effective March 5, 2002, substituted \"manufactured before 1970\" for \"twenty-five years of age or older\" in Subsection A.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective June 20, 1997, deleted former Subsection C defining \"lottery\", redesignated former Subsections D and E as Subsections C and D, inserted \"that is not licensed for use pursuant to the Gaming Control Act and\" near the beginning of Subsection C, inserted \"that is not within the premises of a person licensed as a lottery retailer or that is not licensed pursuant to the Gaming Control Act\" in the first sentence of Subsection D, added Subsection E, and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, in Subsection C, inserted \"other than the New Mexico state lottery established and operated pursuant to the New Mexico Lottery Act\" and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nThe 1985 amendmentadded Subsection A, redesignated former Subsections A, B, C, and D as present Subsections B, C, D, and E, respectively, and inserted \"other than an antique gambling device\" following \"contrivance\" near the beginning of Subsection D.\n\nDue process.— \"Gambling device\" is defined with acceptable clarity, given the legislative dilemma of drafting criminal statutes general enough to escape legalistic evasion while specific enough to give fair warning of proscribed conduct.State v. Marchiondo, 1973-NMCA-137, 85 N.M. 627, 515 P.2d 146, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 639, 515 P.2d 643.\n\nMeaning of \"lottery\".— A lottery was a game of hazard in which small sums of money were ventured for chance of obtaining a larger value in money or other articles, and the test employed for detecting a lottery was the presence of a prize, chance and consideration, the presence of all three compelling its characterization as such.State v. Jones, 1940-NMSC-066, 44 N.M. 623, 107 P.2d 324 (decided under prior law).\n\nTest employed.— The test employed for detecting a lottery is the presence of three elements, prize, chance and consideration.State v. Jones, 1940-NMSC-066, 44 N.M. 623, 107 P.2d 324 (opinion rendered under prior law).\n\nBaseball pools.— Where tickets were sold in books of 120, to be sold at 10 cents each, entitling the holder to a $9.00 prize from a lucky ticket containing the names of two ball teams making the high scores each day, there was a lottery, although the tickets themselves did not convey the information as to the prize.State v. Butler, 1938-NMSC-017, 42 N.M. 271, 76 P.2d 1149.\n\n\"Bank Night\" scheme.— Scheme operated under name \"Bank Night\" involved an element of \"consideration\" which together with elements of \"prize\" and \"chance,\" constituted the scheme of a \"lottery\" under prior law.State v. Jones, 1940-NMSC-066, 44 N.M. 623, 107 P.2d 324.\n\nMeaning of \"gambling device\".— No contrary intent appearing in the statute, the ordinary and usual meaning of the term \"gambling devices\" is to be used, that is, those devices which are normally associated with gambling.State v. Marchiondo, 1973-NMCA-137, 85 N.M. 627, 515 P.2d 146, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 639, 515 P.2d 643.\n\nWhere there is no allegation that owners of slot machines were involved in illegal gambling, and the only persons who played the slot machines were the owners and their social acquaintances, and there is no allegation or proof that anyone playing a machine made any money except through winnings as a player, no \"consideration\" was paid to owners to play a machine so there is no \"gambling device\".State ex rel. N.M. Gaming Control Bd. v. Ten (10) Gaming Devices, 2005-NMCA-117, 138 N.M. 426, 120 P.3d 848, cert. quashed, 2006-NMCERT-003, 139 N.M. 352, 132 P.3d 1038.\n\nComputer terminal was not a gambling device.— Where defendant owned and operated an internet cafe where customers could purchase time on the internet using computer terminals in the cafe as a promotion, defendant gave customers free entries into a sweepstakes that awarded cash prizes determined by chance; defendant's computer system pre-determined the winning sweepstakes entries; sweepstake entries were delivered to customers in the form or a \"swipe card\" that was swiped into a reader for visual display at the caf 's counter or at individual computer terminals; money could not be inserted into the computer terminals to participate in the sweepstakes; additional sweepstake entries could only be obtained from the caf 's counter and then downloaded upon the \"swipe card\"; and the computer terminals gave consumers anything of value, defendant's computer terminals were not a gambling device.State v. Vento, 2012-NMCA-099, 286 P.3d 627, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-009.\n\nExchange of pull tabs for free games won on video machines.— The practice of exchanging pull tabs for free games won on electronic video games was impermissible under the Bingo and Raffle Act, Chapter 60, Article 2B NMSA 1978, since to permit operation of the machines for such purpose would be to sanction commercial gambling.American Legion Post No. 49 v. Hughes, 1994-NMCA-153, 120 N.M. 255, 901 P.2d 186, cert. quashed, 120 N.M. 117, 898 P.2d 1255.\n\nExtent of pari-mutuel exemption.— It was the intention of the legislature to exempt pari-mutuel betting from the general provisions of the gambling laws only when done by patrons who are physically present at the track; one who is not personally present at the track is not a patron thereof and does not come within the pari-mutuel exemption at Section 60-1-10 NMSA 1978.Schnoor v. Griffin, 1968-NMSC-067, 79 N.M. 86, 439 P.2d 922 (decided under prior law).\n\nOff-track betting illegal.— The giving of money to defendant and his transporting it to the place of betting was inseparable from the act of placing the bet itself; to sanction such a procedure would permit a mode of gambling not allowed by the pari-mutuel statute.Schnoor v. Griffin, 1968-NMSC-067, 79 N.M. 86, 439 P.2d 922 (decided under prior law).\n\nIllegal gambling contract unenforceable.— The public policy of New Mexico is to restrain and discourage gambling and must override the rule which prevents unjust enrichment, particularly where there is a choice between that which is considered to be for the benefit of the public at large as distinguished from any benefit to an individual litigant.Schnoor v. Griffin, 1968-NMSC-067, 79 N.M. 86, 439 P.2d 922 (decided under prior law).\n\nApplicability of gambling laws to Indians.— State law did not permit authorization of \"all forms of casino-style games\" in compacts with Indian tribes negotiated by the governor pursuant to the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.State ex rel. Clark v. Johnson, 1995-NMSC-048, 120 N.M. 562, 904 P.2d 11.\n\nState statutes are not superseded by federal laws relating to lottery broadcasting;being a form of gambling, lotteries are primarily a matter of state interest and policy under the police power. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-141 (opinion rendered under prior law).\n\nSince there is no indication of a congressional intent to reserve regulation of the broadcasting of lotteries to the federal government, states may regulate such broadcasts to the same extent as the broadcasting of other gambling information. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-141 (opinion rendered under prior law).\n\nMeaning of \"lottery\".— A lottery has been defined as a plan which contains the elements of prize, chance and consideration. 1963 Op.

No. 55-6168 (opinion rendered under prior law).\n\nConsideration present even without purchase from promoter.— The consideration necessary for a lottery may be present even where no purchase is required as a condition precedent to eligibility for a prize. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-141 (opinion rendered under prior law).\n\nWhere a lottery plan involves increased traffic to the participating stores with a necessarily resultant increase in sales, therein lies the financial advantage to the promoter and thus consideration as defined in this section. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-141 (opinion rendered under prior law).\n\nBroadening of exclusions.— By the 1965 amendment to this section the legislature intended to liberalize or broaden the definition of activities that were not prohibited by law. 1965 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-196.\n\nDefinition of lottery.— The definition of lottery was intended to broaden the exclusions for certain types of operations which were not basically an attempt to hazard a sum for the hope of a larger sum. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-60.\n\nSubstance of scheme important.— In analyzing an operation to determine whether or not it is a lottery, the court must look to the substance of the scheme as well as the form. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-60.\n\nActivity primarily a lottery.— When a promoter charges more than the usual price of an innocent activity and advertises that prizes will be drawn by lot and awarded to the holder of the ticket for the activity then the activity is primarily a lottery. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-60.\n\nDrawing hotel room number.— Where plan was to assign numbers to each of the rooms of a motel, there being some 16 rooms, and as the rooms were filled in the course of the evening, to conduct a drawing, with the person occupying the room number corresponding with the number drawn from the hat to receive his room rent free for that night, the scheme constituted a lottery and was, therefore, illegal under former gambling laws. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6347.\n\nStore punch card.— Scheme whereby a punch card is given to each customer purchasing merchandise in a store or chain of stores, and each time the customer purchases items from the store, the dollar amount of the purchase is punched out on the card until the customer's purchases reach a certain total, at which point the large seal on the card is removed under which is found one of three dollar amounts representing the customer's prize, or in the alternative, some simple question the answer to which entitles the customer to a prize constituted a lottery under former gambling laws. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-05.\n\nNature of \"pecuniary value\" intended.— Pecuniary value must be paid over and above payment for a legal activity before the giving of a door prize at a legal activity is to be considered an illegal lottery. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-60.\n\nPecuniary value.— Element of pecuniary consideration for the sole purpose of engaging in the gambling enterprise must be present. 1965 Op. Att'y Gen.

Att'y Gen. No. 69-60.\n\nNo pecuniary value paid.— If one pays the normal going rate for a dinner or theater ticket or style show and a prize or prizes are given in conjunction with those legal activities, one has not paid to the promoter anything of pecuniary value in order to participate in the chance at the prize. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-60.\n\nDrawing of numbered tickets of admission to the state fair, for a prize, in which those individuals who had purchased tickets would be entitled to participate, would be legal, since no consideration would be paid for the privilege of participating in the opportunity to win a prize. 1965 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-196.\n\nSpecific intent understood.— The narrow definitions of gambling device and dealing in gambling devices in the New Mexico law require a specific intent to use or transfer for use with a gambling purpose, and use for entertainment alone would not subject the parties to prosecution under the gambling statutes. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-54.\n\nChance to win prize determinative.— If there was no opportunity to obtain anything of value when a gambling device was used for entertainment, then the item would not be a gambling device within the definition of this section. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-54.\n\nSavings and loan promotion legal.— A savings and loan association may give every person who deposits a certain amount in a savings account a chance to win a four-day all-expense-paid trip at a drawing without violating the New Mexico gambling laws. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-109.\n\nSelling of souvenir tokens.— Where the element of chance is absent, slot machines converted into vending machines which will sell souvenir tokens do not fall within the definition of gambling device. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-39.\n\nApplicability of gambling laws to Indians.— Where federal law is silent on gambling and state law prohibits it, and such gambling is carried on by Indians in Indian country, the gambling is illegal, with exclusive jurisdiction resting in the federal courts unless the gambling has already been punished by the tribal court. 1965 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-221 (opinion rendered under prior law).\n\nUnder the federal Assimilative Crimes Act, there would not be a conflict between federal and state laws on gambling if carried on in Indian country and gambling is illegal in the state. 1965 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-221 (opinion rendered under prior law).\n\nState courts would have jurisdiction over a non-Indiancharged with conducting a gambling operation on an Indian reservation. 1965 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-221 (opinion rendered under prior law).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— Scheme for advertising or stimulating legitimate business as a lottery, 48 A.L.R. 1115, 57 A.L.R. 424, 103 A.L.R. 866, 109 A.L.R. 709, 113 A.L.R. 1121.\n\nWhat is a game of chance, 135 A.L.R. 104.\n\nValidity, construction, and application of statutes or ordinances involved in prosecutions for transmission of wagers or wagering information related to bookmaking, 53 A.L.R.4th 801.\n\nPrivate contests and lotteries: entrants' rights and remedies, 64 A.L.R.4th 1021.\n\nValidity, construction, and application of statute or ordinance prohibiting or regulating use or occupancy of premises for bookmaking or pool selling, 82 A.L.R.4th 356.",

La Rue, 1960-NMSC-054, 67 N.M. 149, 353 P.2d 367 (decided under prior law).\n\nGambling distinguished from commercial gambling.— Gambling under Subsection A of this section is distinguishable from commercial gambling under 30-19-3B NMSA 1978 in that this section requires only one act whereas 30-19-3B NMSA 1978 requires more than one act to constitute a violation.State v. Owens, 1984-NMCA-105, 103 N.M. 121, 703 P.2d 898, cert. quashed, 103 N.M. 62, 702 P.2d 1007 (1985).\n\nLongstanding prohibition.— The declared prohibition against gambling in any manner or form has long been a part of the existing law of this state.Ross v.

Copely, 1873-NMSC-007, 1 N.M. 571 (decided under prior law).\n\nDistribution of common lands by lot illegal.— Scheme whereby community land grant attempted to distribute some 10,000 acres of common lands among almost 2000 heirs by lottery, at a nominal fee, amounted to a violation of the statute law of this state prohibiting lotteries, as well as amounting to a dissipation of the assets of the corporation, contrary to law.Armijo v.

Biswell, 700 F.2d 1310 (10th Cir. 1983).\n\nGambling contract unenforceable.— An action cannot be maintained on a contract that is illegal or against public policy, where both parties are equally culpable.Schnoor v. Griffin, 1968-NMSC-067, 79 N.M. 86, 439 P.2d 922.\n\nRaffle where purchase unnecessary.— The offering by a nightclub and package store of raffle tickets to patrons upon their entry into the premises, for a drawing to be held once a week at which prizes would be given away, so long as an individual might participate in the drawing without being required to purchase something (part with anything of pecuniary value), this would not fall within the statutory definition of a lottery and is not prohibited by this section. 1973 Op.

Owens, 1984-NMCA-105, 103 N.M. 121, 703 P.2d 898, cert. quashed, 103 N.M. 62, 702 P.2d 1007.\n\nElements of offense.— That game be played for money or anything of value was an essential element in violation of former gambling law, as merely playing or operating the gaming device was not actionable.State v. Valdez, 1947-NMSC-059, 51 N.M. 393, 185 P.2d 977.\n\nComputer sweepstakes promotion was a lottery.— Where defendant owned and operated an internet cafe where customers could purchase time on the internet using computer terminals in the cafe; as a promotion, defendant gave customers free entries into a sweepstakes that awarded cash prizes determined by chance; defendant's computer system pre-determined the winning sweepstakes entries; customers could not obtain a refund of any internet time they did not use which consisted of 99.75% of internet time purchased; and defendant retained 8% of revenues from the sale of internet time and used the balance of the revenues to pay sweepstake prizes to customers, there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that defendant's sweepstakes promotion was a lottery.State v. Vento, 2012-NMCA-099, 286 P.3d 627, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-009.\n\nCard game for value.— The game of solo, played with cards for something of value, was made an offense by the general language of Laws 1921, ch. 86, § 1 (former 40-22-1, 1953 Comp.).Grafe v. Delgado, 1924-NMSC-065, 30 N.M. 150, 228 P. 601.\n\nSlot machines.— Slot machines, where the chances were unequal with the chances in favor of the machine, were covered by former gambling law as illegal.Territory v. Jones, 1908-NMSC-03014 N.M. 579, 99 P. 338 (1908).\n\nHand held \"power bingo\".— Hand held electronic devices known as \"power bingo\" are \"gambling devices\" within the meaning of this section and Section 30-19-2 NMSA 1978, and such units may not be used in New Mexico.Citation Bingo, Ltd. v. Otten, 1996-NMSC-003, 121 N.M. 205, 910 P.2d 281.\n\nFree games as thing of value.— Where free games were awarded through chance to a player for his enjoyment in successfully operating a pinball machine, he received something of value within proscription of Laws 1921, ch. 86, § 1 (former 40-22-1, 1953 Comp.).Giomi v. Chase, 1942-NMSC-071, 47 N.M. 22, 132 P.2d 715.\n\nRepayment in chewing gum.— Fact that slot machine always paid player value of his money in chewing gum did not exclude it from operation of anti-gambling law.State v. Apodaca, 1926-NMSC-053, 32 N.M. 80, 251 P. 389.\n\nSupplying of lottery tickets.— One who supplied lottery tickets to others to be sold, but did not otherwise participate in the promotion of the lottery was nevertheless subject to the penalty.State v. Butler, 1938-NMSC-017, 42 N.M. 271, 76 P.2d 1149.\n\nEssential allegations.— If allegation that operation of a game of chance \"for money or anything of value\" was omitted, the indictment or information failed to charge any offense and use of word \"unlawfully\" operating of a game of chance did not cure the defect.State v. Valdez, 1947-NMSC-059, 51 N.M. 393, 185 P.2d 977.\n\nFailure to charge offense.— Where information was insufficient in failing to charge an offense under statute prohibiting operation of games of chance \"for money or anything of value,\" did not state particulars of the offense and did not refer to the section of the statute creating the offense, information could not be amended after all the evidence was introduced at the trial.State v. Ardovino, 1951-NMSC-018, 55 N.M. 161, 228 P.2d 947, distinguished inState v. Silva, 1967-NMCA-008, 78 N.M. 286, 430 P.2d 783.\n\nIndictment sufficient.— An information charging accused, under former law, with \"having in his possession lottery tickets for the purpose of vending the same contrary to the form of the statute,\" with bill of particulars describing the form of the tickets used, was sufficient.State v. Butler, 1938-NMSC-017, 42 N.M. 271, 76 P.2d 1149.\n\nAdmissions as part of res gestae.— Unless the corpus delicti of the offense charged has been otherwise established, a conviction cannot be sustained solely on extrajudicial confessions or admissions of an accused, but where evidence establishes the commission of the offense charged independently of the admissions by appellant, admissions at the time of arrest and at the place where the paraphernalia was found are a part of the res gestae and, for that reason, are admissible.State v. La Rue, 1960-NMSC-054, 67 N.M. 149, 353 P.2d 367 (decided under prior law).\n\nEvidence of operating adequate.— While no gambling was observed on the premises, evidence of discovery of gambling paraphernalia in basement of cafe, in which defendant and others were also found, along with statements of defendant admitting that he was the operator, pointed unerringly to defendant's guilt.State v. La Rue, 1960-NMSC-054, 67 N.M. 149, 353 P.2d 367 (decided under prior law).\n\nAdmission of \"other crimes\" held prejudicial.— The admission of evidence of \"other crimes, wrongs and misconduct\" is prejudicial error where it laps over into a smear on gambling and general criminal activity, destroying the justification of relevance on a particular issue of intent.United States v. Biswell, 700 F.2d 1310 (10th Cir. 1983).\n\nInstruction on operation approved.— Instruction that any person who manages, controls or takes or receives any money or thing of value from game for running the game or like purpose shall be deemed an operator of such game was substantially in the language of the applicable statute and correctly stated the law.Kilpatrick v. State, 1953-NMSC-117, 58 N.M. 88, 265 P.2d 978.\n\nJury instructions were improper.— Where defendant owned and operated an internet cafe where customers could purchase time on the internet using computer terminals in the cafe; as a promotion, defendant gave customers free entries into a sweepstakes that awarded cash prizes determined by chance; defendant's computer system pre-determined the winning sweepstakes entries; the jury was instructed on all alternative bases for a commercial gambling conviction, including the definitions of a bet, a lottery, and a gambling device; and the jury returned a general verdict that found defendant guilty of commercial gambling without identifying the underlying basis for the conviction among the alternatives in the commercial gambling statute, the district court erred when it used a general verdict form and instructed the jury on the charge of commercial gambling based upon the mutually exclusive theories of a lottery or a bet.State v. Vento, 2012-NMCA-099, 286 P.3d 627, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-009.\n\nQuestions for jury.— Where there was a substantial conflict as to whether or not the defendant operated a game of chance for money in his premises on the night in question, it was for the jury to determine the weight of the evidence, and also the credibility of the witnesses, and not the duty of the appellate court to do so.Kilpatrick v. State, 1953-NMSC-117, 58 N.M. 88, 265 P.2d 978.\n\nConsideration.— Either a promise by the participant to pay if he does not win or payment by the participant subject to return of his money should chance make him the winner is sufficient as consideration; that a subsequent event may relieve from the promise or payment cannot obliterate the fact that at the time the participant enters the scheme consideration is rendered. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6168.\n\nEither a promise to pay or payment is, when tested by the law of contracts, sufficient as consideration. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6347.\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico criminal law, see 16 N.M.L. Rev. 9 (1986).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 38 Am.

Dealing in gambling devices consists of manufacturing, transferring commercially or possessing, with intent to transfer commercially, any of the following:\n\n(1) anything which he knows evidences, purports to evidence or is designed to evidence participation in gambling; or\n\n(2) any device which he knows is designed exclusively for gambling purposes or anything which he knows is designed exclusively as a subassembly or essential part of such device. This includes, without limitation, gambling devices, numbers jars, punchboards and roulette wheels.\n\nProof of possession of any device designed exclusively for gambling purposes which is not in a gambling place and is not set up for use is prima facie evidence of possession with intent to transfer.\n\nB. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any manufacturer of gambling devices who exports his product exclusively in foreign commerce, and who is under ten thousand dollar ($10,000) bond payable to the state of New Mexico to assure export.\n\nProvided, however, the provisions of this section shall apply to manufacturers of gambling devices used, adapted, devised or designed to be used in bookmaking, in wagering pools with respect to a sporting event, or in a numbers, policy, bolita or similar game.\n\nC.
