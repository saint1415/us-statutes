      "text": "Chapter 30, Article 31 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Controlled Substances Act\".\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 54-11-1, enacted by Laws 1972, ch. 84, § 1; 2005, ch. 280, § 1.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added the statutory reference to the act.\n\nCivil and criminal penalties.— The Double Jeopardy Clause of the New Mexico constitution does not prohibit the legislature from assessing both civil and criminal penalties for violations of the Controlled Substances Act. However, if the state elects to seek both criminal conviction and forfeiture of assets, the penalties must be parsed in a single, bifurcated proceeding.State v. Esparza, 2003-NMCA-075, 133 N.M. 772, 70 P.3d 762, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 771, 70 P.3d 761.\n\nConstitutionality.— The title of Laws 1972, Chapter 84 does not violate N.M. Const., art. IV, § 16 by embracing more than one subject, because although the act amends sections of the state Drug and Cosmetic Act, the amendments are all concerned with drugs.State v. Romero, 1974-NMCA-015, 86 N.M. 99, 519 P.2d 1180.\n\nUniform scheme for controlling registrants and nonregistrants.— The legislature did not establish a parallel scheme for punishing violations of the Controlled Substances Act. That is, there is not one system for controlling registrants authorized to conduct transactions in controlled substances and another for nonregistrants. The punishment for violating a provision of the act depends not on the offender's status but on the nature of the violation.State v. Carr, 1981-NMCA-029, 95 N.M. 755, 626 P.2d 292, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 669, 625 P.2d 1186, and cert. denied, 454 U.S. 853, 102 S. Ct. 298, 70 L. Ed. 2d 145 (1981),overruled on other grounds byState v.

Nunez,\" see 31 N.M.L. Rev. 401 (2001).\n\nFor note and comment, \"Complying with Nunez: The Necessary Procedure for Obtaining Forfeiture of Property and Avoiding Double Jeopardy after State v. Esparza,\" see 34 N.M. L. Rev. 561 (2004).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 25 Am. Jur. 2d Drugs, Narcotics and Poisons §§ 17, 19, 33, 130, 141, 191, 206.\n\nProsecutions based upon alleged illegal possession of instruments to be used in violation of narcotics laws, 92 A.L.R.3d 47.\n\nCompetency of drug addict or user to identify suspect material as narcotic or controlled substance, 95 A.L.R.3d 978.\n\nLiability for discharge of at-will employee for refusal to submit to drug testing, 79 A.L.R.4th 105.\n\nDefense of necessity, duress, or coercion in prosecution for violation of state narcotics laws, 1 A.L.R.5th 938.\n\nValidity, construction and application of state \"drug kingpin\" statutes, 30 A.L.R.5th 121.\n\nValidity, construction and application of state or local law prohibiting maintenance of vehicle for purpose of keeping or selling controlled substances, 31 A.L.R.5th 760.\n\nValidity, construction, and application of state statue criminalizing possession of contraband by individual in penal or correctional institution, 45 A.L.R.5th 767.\n\nAvailability of defense of duress or coercion in prosecution for violation of federal narcotics laws, 75 A.L.R.

Pursuant to Laws 2018, ch. 41, § 3, the effective date of Laws 2018, ch. 41, §§ 1 and 2 is July 25, 2018.\n\n2017 Amendments.— Laws 2017, ch. 140, § 3, effective June 16, 2017, specified that the enumeration of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinols, or chemical derivatives of tetrahydrocannabinol as Schedule I controlled substances does not apply to cultivation of industrial hemp by qualified entities pursuant to rules adopted by the New Mexico department of agriculture; and added Paragraph E(1) and designated the remaining language of Subsection E as Paragraph E(2).\n\nLaws 2017, ch. 139, § 2, effective June 16, 2017, specified that the enumeration of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinols, or chemical derivatives of tetrahydrocannabinol as Schedule I controlled substances does not apply to industrial hemp, pursuant to rules promulgated by the board of regents of New Mexico state university on behalf of the New Mexico department of agriculture; and added Paragraph E(1) and designated the remaining language of Subsection E as Paragraph E(2).\n\nThe 2011 amendment,effective March 31, 2011, in Paragraphs (19) through (25) of Subsection C, added synthetic cannabinoids and other synthetic drugs to the list of Schedule I controlled substances.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective July 1, 2007, amended Subsection E to exclude from Schedule I marijuana that is used by qualified patients pursuant to the Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added Subsection F to provide that the board may by rule add controlled substances to Schedule I.\n\nSufficient evidence that chemicals were synthetic cannabinoids.— Where defendant was convicted of trafficking methamphetamine and distribution of synthetic cannabinoids based on evidence that an accomplice, at the direction of defendant, delivered methamphetamine and the chemicals PB-22 and 5F-PB22 hidden in deodorant sticks to an inmate confined in the Curry county detention center, and where defendant claimed that the state failed to prove that the substances were synthetic cannabinoids because the particular chemicals were not listed as controlled substances under the New Mexico Controlled Substances Act (CSA), there was sufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the chemicals collected from the deodorant sticks were \"synthetic cannabinoids\" within the meaning of this section where the state presented testimony from an expert in forensic chemistry that the chemicals PB-22 and 5F-PB22 are categorized as synthetic cannabinoids because while completely synthetic, the chemicals mimic the effects of cannabis.State v. Salazar, 2018-NMCA-030, cert. denied.\n\nInsufficient evidence that substance was synthetic cannabinoid.— Where defendant was arrested and charged with a single count of possession of synthetic cannabinoids, and where defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction because the state failed to meet its burden of proving that the substance in his possession was a synthetic cannabinoid, there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction where the state failed to introduce evidence that scientific testing was ever done to determine what chemicals were present in or applied to the substance found in defendant's possession, and therefore could not prove that the substance contained a chemical that falls either into one of the classes of chemicals listed in a statute or regulation or within the neurochemical definition of synthetic cannabinoid.State v. Arias, 2018-NMCA-057.\n\nLaw reviews.— For discussion of Indian law concerning peyote's use for religious purposes, see 18 N.M.L. Rev. 403 (1988).\n\nAm.

Where methadone is prescribed, administered or dispensed by a practitioner of a drug abuse rehabilitation program while acting in the course of the practitioner's professional practice, or otherwise lawfully obtained or possessed by a person, such person shall not possess such methadone beyond the date stamped or typed on the label of the container of the methadone, nor shall any person possess methadone except in the container in which it was originally administered or dispensed to such person, and such container shall include a label showing the name of the prescribing physician or practitioner, the identity of methadone, the name of the ultimate user, the date when the methadone is to be administered to or used or consumed by the named ultimate user shown on the label and a warning on the label of the methadone container that the ultimate user must use, consume or administer to the ultimate user the methadone in such container. Any person who violates this subsection is guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than five years, or by a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000), or both.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 54-11-7, enacted by Laws 1972, ch. 84, § 7; 1978, ch. 22, § 9; 1979, ch. 112, § 1; 2005, ch. 280, § 3; 2007, ch. 210, § 9; 2021 (1st S.S.), ch. 4, § 65.\n\nThe 2021(1st S.S.)amendment,effective June 29, 2021, removed marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinols and chemical derivatives of tetrahydrocannabinols from the list of Schedule II controlled substances; and in Subsection A, deleted Subparagraphs A(1)(e) and A(1)(f).\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective July 1, 2007, included in Schedule II marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinols and its derivatives that are used by qualified patients pursuant to the Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added Subsection A(4) to provide that the board may by rule add controlled substances to Schedule II; deleted the former provision in Subsection B that a drug abuse rehabilitation program was defined in Section 26-2-13A(3) NMSA 1978.\n\nMorphine.— Although the word \"morphine\" does not appear in the schedules in this act, the trial court could properly take judicial notice that morphine is an opium derivative under this section.State v. Yanez, 1976-NMCA-073, 89 N.M. 397, 553 P.2d 252.\n\nPercodan.— Percodan is a Schedule II controlled substance.State v. Sanchez, 1979-NMCA-133, 93 N.M. 596, 603 P.2d 335.\n\nCocaine may be classified as narcotic.— The legislature can rationally classify cocaine, a nonnarcotic central nervous system stimulant, as a narcotic for penalty and regulatory purposes because of the similarity between cocaine and narcotic drugs in terms of cocaine's potential for societal harm.Chouinard v. State, 1980-NMCA-168, 96 N.M. 783, 635 P.2d 986,rev'd on other grounds, 1981-NMSC-096, 96 N.M. 658, 634 P.2d 680, cert. denied, 456 U.S. 930, 102 S. Ct. 1980, 72 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1982).\n\nProof of abusive quantity of amphetamine not required.— The state need not prove that an amphetamine alleged to have been sold by the defendant was of a sufficient quantity to have a potential for abuse associated with a stimulant effect, since, in Subsection A(3), the statutory words \"having a potential for abuse\" modify \"substances,\" not \"any quantity.\"State v. Hernandez, 1986-NMCA-017, 104 N.M. 97, 717 P.2d 73, cert. denied, 103 N.M. 798, 715 P.2d 71;State v.

A person who knowingly violates Subsection B of this section within a drug-free school zone excluding private property residentially zoned or used primarily as a residence is guilty of a first degree felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 54-11-20, enacted by Laws 1972, ch. 84, § 20; 1974, ch. 9, § 1; 1980, ch. 23, § 1; 1987, ch. 68, § 2; 1990, ch. 19, § 3; 2006, ch. 17, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For instructions as to trafficking in controlled substances,seeUJI 14-3110 NMRA et seq.\n\nThe 2006 amendment,effective July 1, 2006, added Subparagraph (c) to Paragraph (2) of Subsection A to provide that traffic means distribution, sale, barter or giving away of methamphetamine and its salts and isomers and added Subparagraph (c) to Paragraph (3) of Subsection A to provide that traffic means the possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and its salts and isomers.\n\nThe 1990 amendment,effective July 1, 1990, substituted \"Subsection W\" for \"Subsection X\" in Paragraph (1) and made minor stylistic changes in Paragraphs (2) and (3) of Subsection A, and added Subsection C.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nAdvice about possible sentence enhancements.— Where the defendant entered a no contest plea to trafficking cocaine; the district court informed the defendant that the trafficking charge would be a second degree felony with a maximum basic sentence of nine years and that the basic sentence could be enhanced under the habitual offender statute if the defendant had any undisclosed prior felony convictions; the state filed supplemental criminal information alleging that the defendant had three prior felony convictions, two of which were trafficking offenses; there was no indication in the record that before the defendant entered a plea of no contest to the three prior convictions that the defendant was advised about a potential enhancement under the trafficking statute or that the trafficking charge could be treated as a first degree felony with a basic sentence of eighteen years, the court did not adequately and accurately advise the defendant of the possible sentencing enhancements the defendant faced by pleading no contest.Marquez v. Hatch, 2009-NMSC-040, 146 N.M. 556, 212 P.3d 1110.\n\nAct not applicable.— Where defendant did not engage in extraction from substance of natural origin or chemical synthesis, cultivating and growing psilocybin mushrooms, even if by artificial means, is not prohibited by this section.State v. Pratt, 2005-NMCA-099, 138 N.M. 161, 117 P.3d 967, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-008, 138 N.M. 328, 119 P.3d 1265.\n\nTitle constitutional.— The title of Laws 1972, Chapter 84, of which this section is a part, does not violate N.M. Const., art. IV, § 16, by embracing more than one subject, because although the act also amends sections of the state Drug and Cosmetic Act (Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 26-1-1 NMSA 1978), the amendments are all concerned with drugs.State v. Romero, 1974-NMCA-015, 86 N.M. 99, 519 P.2d 1180.\n\nDefendant's contention that this section violated N.M. Const., art. IV, § 16, because it is concerned with trafficking in controlled substances, while title of the act of which it is a part does not include trafficking, was without merit since prohibition on trafficking was a detail germane to drugs, their administration and penalties.State v. Romero, 1974-NMCA-015, 86 N.M. 99, 519 P.2d 1180.\n\nTitle of act constitutional.— Sections 30-31-21 to 30-31-25 NMSA 1978, which define unlawful activities and provide penalties, are not unconstitutional because \"unlawful activities\" are not mentioned in the title of the act.State v. Atencio, 1973-NMCA-110, 85 N.M. 484, 513 P.2d 1266, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 483, 513 P.2d 1265.\n\nConstitutionality.— Subsection A(3) is not unconstitutionally overbroad, as it does not sweep within its ambit actions that would ordinarily be deemed to be constitutionally-protected activities.State v. Curry, 1988-NMCA-031, 107 N.M. 133, 753 P.2d 1321, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 132, 753 P.2d 1320.\n\nSpecial laws prohibited.— Section 30-31-20B(2) NMSA 1978 applies to all second and subsequent trafficking offenses, and, therefore, does not violate the prohibition against special laws of N.M. Const., art. IV, § 24; nor does it violate the requirements of equal protection.State v. Bejar, 1985-NMCA-093, 104 N.M. 138, 717 P.2d 591, cert. quashed, 104 N.M. 54, 716 P.2d 245 (1986).\n\nSection applicable to physician.— This section applies to a physician who gives out drugs for something other than a legitimate medical purpose.State v. Carr, 1981-NMCA-029, 95 N.M. 755, 626 P.2d 292, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 669, 625 P.2d 1186, and cert. denied, 454 U.S. 853, 102 S. Ct. 298, 70 L. Ed. 2d 145 (1981),overruled on other grounds byState v.

When a physician acts without any legitimate medical purpose and beyond the course of professional practice by selling prescriptions that allow the bearer to obtain controlled substances, his conduct should be treated like that of any street-corner pill pusher.State v. Carr, 1981-NMCA-029, 95 N.M. 755, 626 P.2d 292, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 669, 625 P.2d 1186, and cert. denied, 454 U.S. 853, 102 S. Ct. 298, 70 L. Ed. 2d 145 (1981),overruled on other grounds byState v.

Anaya, 1969-NMCA-120, 81 N.M. 52, 462 P.2d 637.\n\nSections not inconsistent.— There is no conflict between Section 30-31-22A NMSA 1978 which excludes narcotic drugs enumerated in Schedule I, such as heroin, from its purview, and this section, under which trafficking in narcotic drugs is prohibited.State v. Atencio, 1973-NMCA-110, 85 N.M. 484, 513 P.2d 1266, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 483, 513 P.2d 1265.\n\nPlain meaning of this section should be given effect,unless this leads to an absurd or unreasonable result.State v. Marshall, 2004-NMCA-104, 136 N.M. 240, 96 P.3d 801, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-008, 136 N.M. 492, 100 P.3d 197.\n\nHeroin is narcotic drug as matter of law.State v. Gonzales, 1974-NMCA-080, 86 N.M. 556, 525 P.2d 916,overruled on other grounds byState v. Bender, 1978-NMSC-044, 91 N.M. 670, 579 P.2d 796 (decided under prior law).\n\nBecause there is no evidence that defendant engaged in \"extraction from substances of natural origin or chemical synthesis\" as defined by Section 30-31-2 M NMSA 1978,his acts of cultivating or growing mushrooms, even if by artificial means, are not prohibited by Subsection A(1) of this section.State v. Pratt, 2005-NMCA-099, 138 N.M. 161, 117 P.3d 967, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-008, 138 N.M. 163, 117 P.3d 967.\n\nAttempt to acquire by misrepresentation not more specific statute.— A defendant charged with attempt to traffic cocaine under Subsection A of this section was not entitled to be charged under Section 30-31-25A(3) NMSA 1978 (\"attempt to acquire controlled substance by misrepresentation\") since the elements defined in both offenses are so distinct that the specific-statute doctrine does not apply.State v. Villalobos, 1995-NMCA-105, 120 N.M. 694, 905 P.2d 732, cert. quashed, 121 N.M. 676, 916 P.2d 1343 (1996).\n\nTrafficking committed irrespective of manufacturer's intention.— The crime of trafficking by manufacturing is committed irrespective of any consideration of whether the manufacturer intended to distribute the controlled substance or keep it for his or her personal use.State v. Marshall, 2004-NMCA-104, 136 N.M. 240, 96 P.3d 801, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-008, 136 N.M. 491, 100 P.3d 197.\n\nEntrapment submitted to jury.— Issue of entrapment in prosecution for selling and distribution of heroin was properly submitted to the jury, where the evidence raised a factual question concerning defendant's predisposition to sell or distribute heroin and concerning the extent of agent's activity in connection with the heroin.State v. Wilson, 1974-NMCA-059, 86 N.M. 348, 524 P.2d 520.\n\nSeverance not necessary.— It was not error for the trial court to refuse to grant motion for severance where defendant was charged with having made three sales to the same individual in the same community and all within a comparatively short period of time, and no prejudice to defendant had been shown.State v. Riordan, 1974-NMCA-013, 86 N.M. 92, 519 P.2d 1029.\n\nFirst offense punishable as second degree felony.— Sentence of 10 to 50 years imposed on defendant, convicted of trafficking prior to the 1974 amendment to this section, was proper; as the statute then declared the crime to be a second degree felony, Section 31-18-11 NMSA 1978 (now repealed), making a \"felony\" as to which a penalty is not specified a fourth degree felony, was not applicable.State v. Herrera, 1974-NMSC-037, 86 N.M. 224, 522 P.2d 76 (decided under prior law).\n\nProcedure upon conviction of subsequent offense.— Upon proof that a conviction is a second or subsequent conviction for trafficking, Subsection B requires that the previous sentence be vacated and that the sentence imposed by law be imposed.State v. Bejar, 1985-NMCA-093, 104 N.M. 138, 717 P.2d 591, cert. quashed, 104 N.M. 54, 716 P.2d 245 (1986).\n\nNotice prior to sentencing as second offender.— Although former narcotic drug statute failed to specify the precise manner in which a prior conviction was to be brought to the attention of the defendant and the court, essential fairness required that there be some pleading filed by the state, whether it be by motion or otherwise, by which a defendant would be given notice and opportunity to be heard before an increased penalty could be imposed.State v. Rhodes, 1966-NMSC-064, 76 N.M. 177, 413 P.2d 214, appeal after remand, 1967-NMSC-052, 77 N.M. 536, 425 P.2d 47;State v. Santillanes, 1981-NMSC-064, 96 N.M. 477, 632 P.2d 354.\n\nSince there was never any charge filed against defendant which would give him notice that, if convicted, he would be sentenced as a second offender, and even though no objection was made by the defendant or his counsel to the questioning by the court as to the prior conviction, sentencing him as a second offender was a denial of due process of law, in that there was no notice or true opportunity to be heard, in a constitutional sense.State v. Rhodes, 1966-NMSC-064, 76 N.M. 177, 413 P.2d 214, appeal after remand, 1967-NMSC-052, 77 N.M. 536, 425 P.2d 47.\n\nEnhancement proceeding.— When an enhancement proceeding is brought after the defendant has begun serving his sentence on the most recent convictions, there is no violation of either the right of due process or the right against double jeopardy, even in the absence of statutory authorization of such a procedure.State v. Santillanes, 1981-NMSC-064, 96 N.M. 477, 632 P.2d 354.\n\nSince defendant's prior convictions for cocaine trafficking and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute resulted from a single arrest, the court did not make an impermissible \"double use\" of the prior convictions by utilizing the prior cocaine trafficking conviction to enhance the defendant's present cocaine trafficking conviction to a first degree felony pursuant to Section 30-31-20B(2) NMSA 1978, and then using the other prior conviction for possession of marijuana to enhance defendant's sentence under the general habitual-offender statute, Section 31-18-17 NMSA 1978.State v. Hubbard, 1992-NMCA-014, 113 N.M. 538, 828 P.2d 971, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 352, 826 P.2d 573.\n\nConditional discharge is not a prior offense for enhancement purposes.— Where defendant received a conditional discharge dismissing his first drug trafficking offense, and four years later was arrested and charged with trafficking methamphetamine, the conditional discharge could not be considered a prior offense for purposes of enhancement, because a conditional discharge entered without an adjudication of guilt is not considered a conviction.State v. Lassiter, 2016-NMCA-078, cert. denied.\n\nWhen federal offense is prior conviction.— State convictions of trafficking of a controlled substance are \"subsequent\" to a federal conviction since the elements necessary to prove the federal offense are the same as those required to prove the state charges. Therefore, the federal offense is a prior conviction for purposes of the penalty provisions of the Controlled Substances Act.State v. Garduno, 1979-NMSC-072, 93 N.M. 335, 600 P.2d 281.\n\nApplicability of habitual offender statute.— In 1983 the habitual offender statute was amended to include persons convicted of narcotics offenses, overruling that part ofState v. Lujan, 1966-NMSC-051, 76 N.M. 111, 412 P.2d 405, which held that the Habitual Offender Act (Habitual Criminal Act) did not apply to persons convicted under the Controlled Substances Act.Minner v. Kerby, 30 F.3d 1311 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\nII. ELEMENTS OF TRAFFICKING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE.\n\nProof of knowledge of drug-free school zone required.— The term \"knowingly\" in Subsection C of Section 30-31-20 NMSA 1978 requires specific knowledge that the offense of trafficking controlled substances will occur within the drug-free school zone, and the state must prove knowledge of the drug-free school zone as an essential element of distributing drugs in a drug-free school zone.State v. Wilson, 2010-NMCA-018, 147 N.M. 706, 228 P.3d 490, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-001, 147 N.M. 673, 227 P.3d 1055.\n\nWhere undercover police officers stopped defendant and asked defendant for drugs; defendant told the officers that defendant was going to buy drugs down the street; defendant left and returned with a third person to the officers' car; the third person sold cocaine to the officers; the sale occurred within a drug-free school zone; and there was no evidence that defendant knew that the sale of the drugs would occur within a drug-free school zone, the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction of conspiracy to traffic cocaine within a drug-free school zone.State v. Wilson, 2010-NMCA-018, 147 N.M. 706, 228 P.3d 490, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-001, 147 N.M. 673, 227 P.3d 1055.\n\nSection does not require specific intent.— Trafficking in a controlled substance by distribution is not a specific intent crime. Since this section prohibiting trafficking by \"distribution, sale, barter or giving away any controlled substance . . . which is a narcotic drug\" only describes a particular act without reference to a defendant's intent to do some further act or achieve some additional consequence, the crime is properly one of general intent.State v. Bender, 1978-NMSC-044, 91 N.M. 670, 579 P.2d 796.\n\nTrafficking by distribution is not a specific intent crime.State v. Turner, 1981-NMCA-144, 97 N.M. 575, 642 P.2d 178, cert. quashed, 98 N.M. 51, 644 P.2d 1039 (1982).\n\nElements of offense of transferring controlled substance.— In order to find a defendant guilty of transferring a controlled substance, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) the defendant transferred a controlled substance; (2) the defendant knew or believed it was a controlled substance; and (3) the transfer occurred in New Mexico on a particular date.Martinez v. State, 1978-NMSC-051, 91 N.M. 747, 580 P.2d 968.\n\nKnowledge of presence and narcotic character of drug essential.— In a prosecution for trafficking in narcotics, the state must prove that defendant knew of the presence and narcotic character of the object possessed.State v. Gonzales, 1974-NMCA-080, 86 N.M. 556, 525 P.2d 916,overruled on other grounds byState v. Bender, 1978-NMSC-044, 91 N.M. 670, 579 P.2d 796.\n\nKnowledge with control.— Since he was not in physical possession of the heroin when it was found by the officers, to be convicted defendant must have constructively possessed it, that is, he must have had knowledge of the presence of the heroin and control over it.State v. Herrera, 1977-NMCA-028, 90 N.M. 306, 563 P.2d 100, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 636, 567 P.2d 485.\n\nOwnership not element.— This section prohibits a defendant from transferring narcotics by way of distribution, sale, barter, or gift: Ownership is not an element.State v. Hernandez, 1986-NMCA-040, 104 N.M. 268, 720 P.2d 303, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 201, 718 P.2d 1349.\n\nIII. DOUBLE JEOPARDY.\n\nTrafficking methamphetamine by manufacture and possession of drug paraphernalia.— Where the defendant was convicted of trafficking methamphetamine by manufacture for possession of items that could be used to manufacture methamphetamine and possession of drug paraphernalia for possession of items that could be used to consume methamphetamine and marijuana, and where the items used to consume drugs were not necessary to manufacture methamphetamine, the defendant's conduct was not unitary and the defendant's convictions did not violate double jeopardy.State v. Vance, 2009-NMCA-024, 145 N.M. 706, 204 P.3d 31, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-001, 145 N.M. 655, 203 P.3d 870.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Since marijuana is not defined as a narcotic drug, trial court acquired no jurisdiction when defendant was charged with violating this section by selling marijuana, hence, there was no basis for a claim of double jeopardy where defendant was later charged under the proper section.State v. Mabrey, 1975-NMCA-098, 88 N.M. 227, 539 P.2d 617.\n\nThe defendant's distribution of drug samples and subsequent distribution of larger quantities of the same drugs to the same persons constituted separate transaction under this section and convictions on distinct counts of trafficking a controlled substance did not violate double jeopardy.State v. Borja-Guzman, 1996-NMCA-025, 121 N.M. 401, 912 P.2d 277, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 375, 911 P.2d 883.\n\nWhere a trial court convicted defendant of one count of a second offense of trafficking a controlled substance and one count of conspiracy to commit that offense, and in sentencing defendant, the trial court used defendant's prior convictions twice to increase the punishment, the prior trafficking conviction could not be used to set defendant's underlying conspiracy to commit trafficking conviction as a second degree felony, and then be used to enhance defendant's sentence under the habitual offender statute.State v. Lacey, 2002-NMCA-032, 131 N.M. 684, 41 P.3d 952, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 737, 42 P.3d 842.\n\nConvictions for trafficking controlled substances with intent to distribute and conspiracy based on a single act.— Where defendant was convicted of trafficking a controlled substance by possession with intent to distribute in violation of Subsection A of this section and conspiracy to commit the same crime in violation of 30-28-2 NMSA 1978, both charges based on evidence of a single sale of drugs by defendant; the defendant's conduct underlying both crimes was unitary, and the state relied on the same evidence, the single sale of drugs from defendant to the co-conspirator, as the basis to convict for both crimes; the defendant was convicted twice and is being punished twice for the same offense, resulting in a double jeopardy violation.State v. Silvas, 2015-NMSC-006,aff'g2013-NMCA-093, 310 P.3d 621.\n\nMerger with charge of conspiracy to racketeer.— In order for the jury to have convicted defendant of conspiracy to racketeer pursuant to the court's instruction, it was also necessary for the state to prove, and the jury to find, that she and another conspired to traffic by manufacture. Thus, the two offenses for which defendant was convicted merged under the facts and circumstances of the case.State v. Wynne, 1988-NMCA-106, 108 N.M. 134, 767 P.2d 373, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 115, 767 P.2d 354 (1989).\n\nPossession deemed lesser offense.— Possession of heroin is a lesser offense included within the offense of possession with intent to distribute heroin.State v. Alderete, 1977-NMCA-130, 91 N.M. 373, 574 P.2d 592, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 491, 576 P.2d 297 (1978).\n\nSeparate offenses.— As there is no ambiguity in this section, which prohibits the sale of \"any\" controlled substance, where evidence showed sales to two separate people, there were two offenses and consecutive sentences received by defendant did not constitute an abuse of the trial court's discretion.State v. Burrell, 1976-NMCA-025, 89 N.M. 64, 547 P.2d 69.\n\nDrug trafficking statute authorizes separate prosecution and punishment for distinct transfers of controlled substances.— Where defendant was convicted of trafficking cocaine by distribution and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, his constitutional right to be free from double jeopardy was not violated, because the legislature clearly intended, in its enactment of 30-31-20 NMSA 1978 criminalizing drug trafficking, to authorize separate prosecution and punishment for each individual transfer or delivery under the circumstances where the transfer is not contemporaneous, and the evidence presented at trial showed that defendant's convictions arose from two separate transfers of a controlled substance, where in each exchange defendant transferred a distinct quantity of cocaine to the undercover officer in exchange for a distinct sum of money.State v. Bello, 2017-NMCA-049, cert. denied.\n\nIV. EVIDENCE AND PROOF.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nInference of knowledge of presence of drugs.— While knowledge of the presence of drugs may be inferred where exclusive possession of the premises is shown, where exclusive possession is not shown, additional evidence is required to support such an inference.State v. Becerra, 1991-NMCA-090, 112 N.M. 604, 817 P.2d 1246, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 440, 816 P.2d 509.\n\nInference of control of drugs.— Control of the premises on which contraband is found is not sufficient to support a determination of criminal liability. There must be knowledge of the presence of the contraband, and there must be evidence sufficient to support an inference of control of the contraband.State v. Becerra, 1991-NMCA-090, 112 N.M. 604, 817 P.2d 1246, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 440, 816 P.2d 509.\n\nConstructive possession.— Constructive possession is sufficient to convict for trafficking by possession with intent to distribute.State v. Zamora, 2005-NMCA-039, 137 N.M. 301, 110 P.3d 517, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-012, 138 N.M. 772, 126 P.3d 1136.\n\nNarcotic character.— The burden of proof was on the defendant to prove that substance identified as heroin was not a narcotic drug as an exemption or exception.State v. Atencio, 1973-NMCA-110, 85 N.M. 484, 513 P.2d 1266, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 483, 513 P.2d 1265.\n\nProving intent by inference.— Intent may be proved by inference from the surrounding facts and circumstances, such as the quantity and manner of packaging of the controlled substance.State v. Muniz, 1990-NMCA-105, 110 N.M. 799, 800 P.2d 734, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 749, 799 P.2d 1121.\n\nProving knowledge of narcotic character.— While there is no requirement that proof of possession with knowledge of narcotic character should be by direct or uncontradicted evidence, nevertheless, the evidence must be such as discloses some conduct, declarations or actions on the part of the defendant sufficient to satisfy the fact finder beyond a reasonable doubt that he had knowledge of the presence and nature of the narcotics.State v. Garcia, 1966-NMSC-063, 76 N.M. 171, 413 P.2d 210,overruled on other gounds byState v. Gomez, 1997-NMSC-006, 122 N.M. 777, 932 P.2d 1.\n\nProof of possession of controlled substancemay be established by evidence of the conduct and actions of a defendant, and by circumstantial evidence connecting the defendant with the crime.State v. Donaldson, 1983-NMCA-064, 100 N.M. 111, 666 P.2d 1258, cert. denied, 100 N.M. 53, 665 P.2d 809.\n\nWhen inference of constructive possession proper.— Since defendant's wife resided with him, he was not in exclusive possession of the premises, and an inference of constructive possession could not be drawn against him unless there were incriminating statements or circumstances tending to support the inference.State v. Herrera, 1977-NMCA-028, 90 N.M. 306, 563 P.2d 100, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 636, 567 P.2d 485.\n\nAdmission of gun evidence was harmless error.— Where defendant was charged with trafficking a controlled substance, tampering with evidence, resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer, and possession of drug paraphernalia after law enforcement officers conducted a traffic stop, during which defendant was found with a large amount of money on his lap and sixty-three small baggies of crack cocaine, and subsequently searched defendant's home, finding a .380 caliber semi-automatic pistol, several small zip-lock baggies, several digital scales, and a brown bag with small zip-lock baggies inside, and where, at trial, defendant objected to the admission of evidence that a gun was found at his residence, claiming that he was not armed at the time of his arrest and that the gun evidence created the impression that he was dangerous and that, in turn, encouraged the jury to convict him of trafficking a controlled substance rather than simple possession, the admission of the gun evidence, assuming error, was harmless. It was doubtful that the admission of the gun evidence had any probable impact on the jury's deliberations regarding trafficking versus possession, considering the evidence that defendant was apprehended with sixty-three baggies of crack cocaine, individually packaged, indicating that the drugs were intended for sale to individuals, in addition to the discovery of digital scales and empty small baggies at defendant's residence.State v. Jackson, 2021-NMCA-059, cert. denied.\n\nB. CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.\n\nConviction sustained by circumstantial evidence.— A conviction for trafficking in a controlled substance can be sustained by circumstantial evidence.State v. Chouinard, 1981-NMSC-096, 96 N.M. 658, 634 P.2d 680, cert. denied, 456 U.S. 930, 102 S. Ct. 1980, 72 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1982).\n\nCircumstantial evidence is sufficient to support a conviction for possession of heroin with an intent to distribute where the defendant was caught with a small amount of heroin, there is an inference that more heroin was flushed down a toilet, and there was paraphernalia at the scene of the arrest consistent with distribution of heroin.State v. Bejar, 1984-NMCA-031, 101 N.M. 190, 679 P.2d 1288, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 189, 679 P.2d 1287;State v. Bejar, 1985-NMCA-093, 104 N.M. 138, 717 P.2d 591, cert. quashed, 104 N.M. 54, 716 P.2d 245.\n\nCircumstantial evidence on nature of substance.— Although there was no direct scientific evidence that the substance which defendant was convicted of trafficking in by possession with intent to distribute was heroin, there was substantial, almost overwhelming, circumstantial evidence to that effect, which was sufficient to sustain the convictions.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-125, 90 N.M. 10, 558 P.2d 1149.\n\nInference of trafficking from amount of drug found.— Evidence that the heroin found weighed 3.3 grams and was 16% pure while street heroin is usually 3% to 5% pure and packaged in weights of 20 to 40 milligrams, that reduction of the heroin to street purity packaged for street sale would result in at least 264 caps of heroin, that heroin is generally packaged for resale on the street in small tinfoil packets such as were found and that search failed to disclose paraphernalia indicating use of the heroin on the premises, permitted the inference that defendant intended to distribute the heroin.State v. Herrera, 1977-NMCA-028, 90 N.M. 306, 563 P.2d 100, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 636, 567 P.2d 485.\n\nProof of possession of a large quantity of a controlled substance, inconsistent with personal use, is sufficient proof of trafficking in a controlled substance.State v. Donaldson, 1983-NMCA-064, 100 N.M. 111, 666 P.2d 1258, cert. denied, 100 N.M. 53, 665 P.2d 809.\n\nAmount of drug inconsistent with personal use.— If the amount of an illegal drug found in an accused's possession is not by itself sufficient to prove inconsistency with personal use, then the state must present testimony that the amount of drugs in the accused's possession is inconsistent with personal use or that the other items found in possession of the accused, such as drug paraphernalia or significant sums of cash, showed that the accused intended to transfer drugs.State v. Hubbard, 1992-NMCA-014, 113 N.M. 538, 828 P.2d 971, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 352, 826 P.2d 573.\n\nUsing weight alone to show intent to distribute.— Where there was no evidence of the concentration of the drug, and no evidence of how long it would normally take a single drug user to consume a given quantity, the weight of the amount recovered (just under two ounces) could not in itself enable a fact finder to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant intended to distribute the substance.State v. Becerra, 1991-NMCA-090, 112 N.M. 604, 817 P.2d 1246, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 440, 816 P.2d 509.\n\nConspiracy to traffic.— The size (one-half to one ounce amounts), frequency (nine transactions in approximately seven weeks) and manner of the transactions (cash, after the receipt of a phone call) were evidence sustaining defendant's conviction for conspiracy with two others to traffic in heroin, and the jury could properly conclude that the heroin defendant supplied was for resale.State v. Armijo, 1976-NMCA-125, 90 N.M. 10, 558 P.2d 1149.\n\nC. SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.\n\nEvidence of trafficking by possession was sufficient.— Where a police officer found defendant passed out in a car; when defendant stepped out of the car, a plastic bag containing crack cocaine fell out of defendant's purse; the officer arrested defendant and conducted inventory searches of the car; the officer found two separate amounts of cash totaling $520, a crack pipe, a second bag containing nineteen \"rocks\" of crack cocaine, three cell phones and baggies in the console of the car; the car was owned by defendant and defendant was the sole occupant of the car; and an expert witness testified that based on the amount of cocaine, baggies, multiple cell phones and amount of cash found in the car, defendant was a trafficker, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of trafficking by possession with intent to distribute cocaine.State v. Rael-Gallegos, 2013-NMCA-092, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-009.\n\nSufficient evidence to convict of manufacturing methamphetamine.— Where a police officer was dispatched to investigate a trash fire; the officer observed bottles of acetone in the burnt trash pile; the officer discovered a meth lab in the house near the trash fire; the officer discovered mail in the house with defendant's name on it; two persons who were on the property stated that defendant lived in the house; one person testified that defendant used Sudafed and the acetone to make methamphetamine, and that the person had obtained methamphetamine from defendant on the day the officer discovered the meth lab; and the other person testified that defendant had been at the house on the morning the officer discovered the meth lab, the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to reasonably infer that defendant manufactured methamphetamine.State v. Brown, 2010-NMCA-079, 148 N.M. 888, 242 P.3d 455, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-007, 148 N.M. 611, 241 P.3d 612.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where defendant quoted a price for methamphetamine to two contacts who wanted to sell the methamphetamine to undercover police officers; the contacts left defendant to meet the officers to confirm that the price was acceptable; the contacts returned to defendant and purchased the methamphetamine; and the contacts then delivered the methamphetamine to the officers in a public school parking lot, there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant, as a principal, of causing the transfer of methamphetamine in a drug free zone.State v. Montes, 2007-NMCA-083, 142 N.M. 211, 164 P.3d 102.\n\nSufficient evidence of trafficking cocaine by distribution and by possession with intent to distribute.— Where defendant was convicted of trafficking cocaine by distribution and by possession with intent to distribute, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions where the state presented evidence that the undercover officer gave an intermediary a $20 bill and watched as defendant removed an unknown substance from his mouth, gave it to the intermediary in exchange for the buy money, and the intermediary returned and gave the officer a package containing a small rock, which later tested positive as cocaine, and evidence that defendant sold the officer a second rock for $10 after the officer complained about the small size of the first rock of cocaine, from which a jury could reasonably infer that defendant was in possession of the first rock of cocaine and intended to transfer it to the officer through the intermediary and that defendant transferred the second rock of cocaine directly to the undercover officer.State v. Bello, 2017-NMCA-049, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of trafficking controlled substances.— Where defendant was charged with trafficking methamphetamine and distribution of synthetic cannabinoids after the state alleged that an accomplice, at the direction of defendant, delivered methamphetamine and synthetic cannabinoids hidden in deodorant sticks to an inmate confined in the Curry county detention center, there was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant's convictions beyond a reasonable doubt where the state presented evidence of recorded phone calls between defendant and the inmate where, according to testimony by the investigating officer, the two men used code words to discuss that defendant was going to obtain illegal narcotics by using the inmate's money from the jail, hide the narcotics in hygiene products, and send the hygiene products into the jail through a third person, and evidence that an inspection of the hygiene products at issue contained a green leafy substance and crystal-like substance wrapped in small baggies in the bottom of deodorant sticks, which were later identified as methamphetamine and synthetic cannabinoids.State v. Salazar, 2018-NMCA-030, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of conspiracy to commit drug trafficking.— Where defendant was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to commit drug trafficking, there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction where evidence established that defendant was associated with a methamphetamine trafficking organization known as the AZ Boys, that the organization was run by defendant's boyfriend and his brother, that defendant had asked a friend, who later became a police informant, to transport drugs, that the informant made several trips transporting drugs with defendant and her boyfriend in exchange for cash and drugs, and that law enforcement recovered four pounds of methamphetamine from the spare tire of the truck the informant had driven for the organization, and, based on evidence that defendant had options available to her other than committing the offense, a rational jury could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not act under duress.State v. Catt, 2019-NMCA-013, cert. denied.\n\nOvert act for attempt to manufacture methamphetamine.— Defendant's acts, including obtaining and possessing suspiciously large amounts of pseudoephedrine and iodine, by traveling to Clovis to obtain inexpensive iodine, renting a motel room where unpackaged pseudoephedrine was stored, and smoking methamphetamine in a room containing over 5,000 pseudoephredrine pills, are sufficient to constitute an overt act in furtherance of the manufacture of methamphetamine.State v. Brenn, 2005-NMCA-121, 138 N.M. 451, 121 P.3d 1050, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-010, 138 N.M. 494, 122 P.3d 1263.\n\nConviction despite no actual possession.— Defendant failed to effect the crime of possession with intent to distribute because he never actually possessed the package containing cocaine which was addressed to him; nevertheless, the fact that he never actually possessed the package did not negate his intent to possess the package, as evidenced by his attempting to pick up the package, nor did it negate his intent to distribute the cocaine, as is evidenced by the amount of cocaine found in the package. Therefore, he was properly convicted of attempted trafficking under Section 30-28-1 NMSA 1978 and Subsection A(3) of this section.State v. Curry, 1988-NMCA-031, 107 N.M. 133, 753 P.2d 1321, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 132, 753 P.2d 1320.\n\nWhen the evidence shows a third party engaging in drug trafficking by possession with intent to distribute a narcotic drug, and the defendant is the third party's accomplice, the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction under Subsection A(3). The fact defendant never touched the cocaine and was often not in the same room where the drug deal took place is not controlling.State v. Bankert, 1994-NMSC-052, 117 N.M. 614, 875 P.2d 370.\n\nThere was sufficient evidence for conviction since it was shown that the defendant was the owner of the premises from which the sale of illegal drugs was carried out in her presence and within her view.State v. Chandler, 1995-NMCA-033, 119 N.M. 727, 895 P.2d 249, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 617, 894 P.2d 394.\n\nExpert testimony identifying substance.— Direct testimony by expert that he analyzed substance according to standard tests and found it to be morphine was sufficient evidence that the substance, which had been sold by defendant, was morphine, despite the fact that on cross-examination the expert did not remember specifically which tests he had used, nor how many different tests he conducted.State v. Baca, 1970-NMCA-075, 81 N.M. 686, 472 P.2d 651, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 721, 472 P.2d 984.\n\nSufficient evidence to convict.— Where (1) defendant \"transferred cocaine to another\"; (2) defendant \"knew that it was cocaine or believed it to be cocaine or believed it to be some drug or other substance the possession of which is regulated or prohibited by law\"; and (3) \"this happened in New Mexico on or about the 21st day of July, 1994\" there was sufficient evidence to convict.State v. Cooper, 1998-NMCA-180, 126 N.M. 500, 972 P.2d 1, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 532, 972 P.2d 351.\n\nThe following substantial evidence supports a conviction for trafficking cocaine with intent to distribute: (1) testimony that people came to the motel door asking for defendant; (2) the presence of a digital scale and razor blade indicating that cocaine was being cut and weighed for distribution; (3) evidence that a portion of the crack cocaine was ready for sale while another bundle was not yet cut in the bathroom; (4) defendant's presence in the bathroom area; and (5) the testimony of one of the detectives that the quantity seized and the drug paraphernalia were consistent with trafficking.State v. Zamora, 2005-NMCA-039, 137 N.M. 301, 110 P.3d 517, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-012, 138 N.M. 772, 126 P.3d 1136.\n\nIdentity of substance a jury question.— Evidence that defendant stated he had brought five vials of morphine to an arranged meeting, that the vial sold, which was sealed and contained a yellowish liquid labeled dilaudid HCL, was taken from the same pocket as other vials and looked the same as others tested and shown to contain a morphine derivative, along with defendant's statement that he had injected the contents of a vial several hours before and was still feeling the effects, and fact that one of the users of the contents of the vial in question claimed to experience a \"tingly feeling\" was sufficient to present a jury question as to whether the contents of the vial sold were a controlled substance, and being substantial was sufficient to sustain conviction.State v. Burrell, 1976-NMCA-025, 89 N.M. 64, 547 P.2d 69.\n\nInference of trafficking from possession by nonuser.— Where evidence showed that defendant was in possession of more than 30 caps of heroin, while defendant himself testified that he was not and had never been a heroin user, the only possible inference was that defendant, at the least, intended to give the heroin away, and this evidence was sufficient to conclude that he was trafficking in heroin.State v. Quintana, 1975-NMCA-034, 87 N.M. 414, 534 P.2d 1126, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 28, 536 P.2d 1085, and cert. denied, 423 U.S. 832, 96 S. Ct. 54, 46 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1975).\n\nAttempted trafficking of cocaine.— Defendant was properly convicted for attempted trafficking in cocaine since he committed the overt acts of accepting a sizeable amount of cash from an undercover narcotics officer and engaging in prior discussion of the illicit transaction.State v. Green, 1993-NMSC-056, 116 N.M. 273, 861 P.2d 954.\n\nPurchaser not guilty of solicitation to traffic.— Even though the defendant's actions in negotiating for the purchase of drugs fall within the definition of criminal solicitation, his conduct was necessarily incidental to the crime of trafficking through the sale of a controlled substance and he could not be guilty of solicitation to traffic.State v. Pinson, 1995-NMCA-045, 119 N.M. 752, 895 P.2d 274.\n\nGrowing marijuana.— Growing marijuana, without more, does not support a charge of trafficking in marijuana by manufacture.State v. Shaulis-Powell, 1999-NMCA-090, 127 N.M. 667, 986 P.2d 463, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 391, 981 P.2d 1209.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where a police officer conducted a search incident to the arrest of defendant for DWI; the officer found a uniquely folded dollar bill in defendant's pocket; the officer unfolded the dollar bill and uncovered a white, powdery substance that was later confirmed to be cocaine; and the officer testified that dollar bills were often used as a way to conceal and later ingest cocaine, the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that the evidence found on defendant was cocaine and that based on the way the dollar bill was folded and its location in defendant's pocket, defendant was aware that the substance was cocaine or another controlled substance.State v. Armendariz-Nunez, 2012-NMCA-041, 276 P.3d 963, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-003.\n\nV. INDICTMENT AND INFORMATION.\n\nIndictment charging alternatives.— Where an indictment charged that the defendants \"did intentionally distribute, possess with intent to distribute, or aided and abetted one another in the distribution of a controlled substance,\" the indictment gave each defendant notice that he must defend against each of these alternatives.State v. Turner, 1981-NMCA-144, 97 N.M. 575, 642 P.2d 178, cert. quashed, 98 N.M. 51, 644 P.2d 1039 (1982).\n\nFailure of indictment to refer to Subsection B does not render it invalid.State v. Bustamante, 1978-NMCA-062, 91 N.M. 772, 581 P.2d 460.\n\nVI. JURY INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nJury instruction for attempt to manufacture.— The jury was properly instructed that it could convict defendant of attempt to manufacture methamphetamine under the theory of accessory liability if it found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant intended that the crime of manufacturing be committed, an attempt to commit the crime was committed, and defendant helped, encouraged or caused the attempt to commit the crime.State v. Brenn, 2005-NMCA-121, 138 N.M. 451, 121 P.3d 1050, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-010, 138 N.M. 494, 122 P.3d 1263.\n\nInstructing on lesser included offense.— Although possession of heroin is a lesser included offense of trafficking in heroin, it should not be instructed on when the evidence does not support the defendant's claim that possession was the highest crime which occurred.State v. Hernandez, 1986-NMCA-040, 104 N.M. 268, 720 P.2d 303, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 201, 718 P.2d 1349.\n\nAlthough possession is not an elementof trafficking by manufacture and a jury instruction on possession was not required to be given with the instruction on trafficking by manufacture, where possession is an issue in dispute, it would be error not to give the instruction on possession.State v. Stefani, 2006-NMCA-073, 139 N.M. 719, 137 P.3d 659, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-006, 140 N.M. 224, 141 P.3d 1278.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note and comment, \"State v.

Except as authorized by the Controlled Substances Act, it is unlawful for a person to intentionally distribute or possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog except a substance enumerated in Schedule I or II that is a narcotic drug, a controlled substance analog of a controlled substance enumerated in Schedule I or II that is a narcotic drug or methamphetamine, its salts, isomers and salts of isomers. A person who violates this subsection with respect to:\n\n(1) synthetic cannabinoids is:\n\n(a) for the first offense, guilty of a fourth degree felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978;\n\n(b) for the second and subsequent offenses, guilty of a third degree felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978;\n\n(c) for the first offense, if more than one hundred pounds is possessed with intent to distribute or distributed or both, guilty of a third degree felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978; and\n\n(d) for the second and subsequent offenses, if more than one hundred pounds is possessed with intent to distribute or distributed or both, guilty of a second degree felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978;\n\n(2) any other controlled substance enumerated in Schedule I, II, III or IV or a controlled substance analog of a controlled substance enumerated in Schedule I, II, III or IV except a substance enumerated in Schedule I or II that is a narcotic drug, a controlled substance analog of a controlled substance enumerated in Schedule I or II that is a narcotic drug or methamphetamine, its salts, isomers and salts of isomers, is:\n\n(a) for the first offense, guilty of a third degree felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978; and\n\n(b) for the second and subsequent offenses, guilty of a second degree felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978; and\n\n(3) a controlled substance enumerated in Schedule V or a controlled substance analog of a controlled substance enumerated in Schedule V is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100) or more than five hundred dollars ($500) or by imprisonment for a definite term not less than one hundred eighty days but less than one year, or both.\n\nB. It is unlawful for a person to distribute gamma hydroxybutyric acid or flunitrazepam to another person without that person's knowledge and with intent to commit a crime against that person, including criminal sexual penetration. For the purposes of this subsection, \"without that person's knowledge\" means the person is unaware that a substance with the ability to alter that person's ability to appraise conduct or to decline participation in or communicate unwillingness to participate in conduct is being distributed to that person. Any person who violates this subsection is:\n\n(1) for the first offense, guilty of a third degree felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978; and\n\n(2) for the second and subsequent offenses, guilty of a second degree felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978.\n\nC.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nTitle constitutional.— Sections 30-31-20 to 30-31-25 NMSA 1978, which define unlawful activities and provide penalties therefor, are not unconstitutional on the grounds that \"unlawful activities\" are not mentioned in the title of the act.State v. Atencio, 1973-NMCA-110, 85 N.M. 484, 513 P.2d 1266, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 483, 513 P.2d 1265.\n\nGreater penalty imposed on seller than on user.— The legislature clearly intended to impose greater penalties on the seller of a controlled substance than upon the user.State v. Sandoval, 1982-NMCA-091, 98 N.M. 417, 649 P.2d 485.\n\nMarijuana use not intrinsic part of religion.— Where the evidence shows that defendant's belief was derived from defendant's personal views of the bible, and those views under the evidence are no more than that the use and distribution of marijuana was permitted because marijuana is a gift from God, such a personal use does not amount to an intrinsic part of a religion.State v. Brashear, 1979-NMCA-027, 92 N.M. 622, 593 P.2d 63.\n\nEffect of Subsection C (now Subsection E).— The \"notwithstanding\" provision of Subsection C (now E) does not provide for a lesser penalty for the first marijuana distribution offense but rather affects only the penalties for second and subsequent marijuana distribution offenses; for second and subsequent marijuana distribution offenses that factually come within Subsection C (now Subsection E), the penalty of Section 30-31-23B(3) NMSA 1978 applies, and a defendant thus avoids the higher penalty stated in Subsection A(1)(b) of this section.State v. Bustamante, 1978-NMCA-062, 91 N.M. 772, 581 P.2d 460.\n\nPenalty applicable to drugs scheduled by regulation.— Express legislative authority is not required to make the penalty provisions of the Controlled Substances Act applicable to drugs scheduled by administrative regulation.State v. Reams, 1981-NMCA-158, 98 N.M. 372, 648 P.2d 1185,aff'd in part, rev'd on other grounds, 1982-NMSC-075, 98 N.M. 215, 647 P.2d 417.\n\nSections not conflicting.— There is no conflict between Subsection A of this section and Sections 30-31-20A(3) and B NMSA 1978.State v. Atencio, 1973-NMCA-110, 85 N.M. 484, 513 P.2d 1266, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 483, 513 P.2d 1265.\n\nDistribution of quaalude.— This section, and not Section 26-1-16A NMSA 1978, is the appropriate legislation under which defendants are to be prosecuted for allegedly unauthorized distribution of quaalude.State v. Reams, 1982-NMSC-075, 98 N.M. 215, 647 P.2d 417.\n\nSentencing under Habitual Offenders Act.— In 1983 the habitual offender statute was amended to include persons convicted of narcotics offenses, overruling that part ofState v. Lujan, 1966-NMSC-051, 76 N.M. 111, 412 P.2d 405, which held that the Habitual Offender Act did not apply to persons convicted under the Controlled Substances Act.Minner v. Kerby, 30 F.3d 1311 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\nApplicability of former habitual criminal law to burglary conviction after drug offense.— There was no conflict between the provisions of Subsection A of this section and Section 31-18-5 NMSA 1978 (repealed,seeSection 31-18-17 NMSA 1978), nor any legislative intent within the Controlled Substances Act, to prohibit use of a Controlled Substances Act conviction to enhance a subsequent burglary conviction, since it was the fact of the prior felony that was the basis for the enhanced sentence for the current burglary.State v. Jordan, 1975-NMCA-102, 88 N.M. 230, 539 P.2d 620.\n\nII. ELEMENTS OF DISTRIBUTION OF CONTROLLED OR COUNTERFEIT SUBSTANCE.\n\nDistribution by prescription.— When a physician writes a prescription neither for a legitimate medical purpose nor in the usual course of his professional practice, he is \"distributing\" drugs.State v. Carr, 1981-NMCA-029, 95 N.M. 755, 626 P.2d 292, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 669, 625 P.2d 1186, and cert. denied, 454 U.S. 853, 102 S. Ct. 298, 70 L. Ed. 2d 145 (1981),overruled on other grounds byState v. Olguin, 1994-NMCA-050, 118 N.M. 91, 879 P.2d 92,aff'd in part, 1995-NMSC-077, 120 N.M. 740, 906 P.2d 731.\n\nNarcotic drugs not included.— Subsection A of this section concerns unlawful conduct involving controlled substances other than the narcotic drugs enumerated in Schedules I and II.State v. Atencio, 1973-NMCA-110, 85 N.M. 484, 513 P.2d 1266, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 483, 513 P.2d 1265.\n\nDrugs excluded.— The \"except\" language in Subsection A excludes a narcotic drug such as heroin, enumerated in Schedule I, from the purview of the subsection.State v. Atencio, 1973-NMCA-110, 85 N.M. 484, 513 P.2d 1266, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 483, 513 P.2d 1265.\n\nSale of narcotics is not involved under this section.State v. Montoya, 1974-NMCA-025, 86 N.M. 155, 520 P.2d 1100,overruled on other grounds byState v. Bender, 1978-NMSC-044, 91 N.M. 670, 579 P.2d 796.\n\nMere possession insufficient.— A conviction based on the offense of possession of marijuana with intent to illegally sell and deliver cannot be sustained upon proof of illegal possession alone and the verdict and judgment based thereon must be reversed.State v. Moreno, 1961-NMSC-070, 69 N.M. 113, 364 P.2d 594.\n\nPlace of distribution immaterial.— The crime of possession with intent to distribute is complete if there is possession with the requisite intent, and the state is not required to prove the place of the intended distribution.State v. Bowers, 1974-NMCA-135, 87 N.M. 74, 529 P.2d 300, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 29, 536 P.2d 1085 (1975).\n\nIII. DOUBLE JEOPARDY.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Defendant's convictions for possession of methamphetamine and possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute based on a single act of possessing methamphetamine violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.State v. Quick, 2009-NMSC-015, 146 N.M. 80, 206 P.3d 985.\n\nLesser included offense.— The separate crimes of possession of methamphetamine and possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute apply in the alternative when based on a single act of possession.State v. Quick, 2009-NMSC-015, 146 N.M. 80, 206 P.3d 985.\n\nPossession is lesser offense necessarily included in distribution of marijuana.State v. Medina, 1975-NMCA-033, 87 N.M. 394, 534 P.2d 486.\n\nDistribution prosecution barred by conviction of possession.— Where defendant was convicted of the lesser offense of possession of marijuana, the principles of double jeopardy barred his subsequent prosecution of the greater offense of distribution.State v. Medina, 1975-NMCA-033, 87 N.M. 394, 534 P.2d 486.\n\nRetrial for possession barred.— When two counts were charged in an indictment, one for illegal possession of marijuana and the other for possession with intent to sell, an instruction by the court that the jury was to disregard the possession count if it found defendant guilty of the latter offense operated as an acquittal on the possession count and prevented retrial of this issue when the verdict on possession with intent to distribute was overturned.State v. Moreno, 1961-NMSC-070, 69 N.M. 113, 364 P.2d 594.\n\nConstructive proof of possession sufficient.— Proof of actual possession is not necessary to sustain a conviction of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Constructive possession will suffice.State v. Muniz, 1990-NMCA-105, 110 N.M. 799, 800 P.2d 734, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 749, 799 P.2d 1121.\n\nIV. EVIDENCE AND PROOF.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nPolice officer's suspicions based on experience.— Where the police officer had 11 years of experience, of which he had spent eight years in the drug interdiction program actively participating in exercises on the freeways in various counties, and he estimated making an average of five drug trafficking arrests per year during that time, with up to 85 percent of those arrests involving rental cars and he testified that in his experience, it was common to find rental cars being used to transport drugs, frequently where the actual renter of the vehicle was not present, in light of the totality of the circumstances and the officer's training and experience, the officer's suspicion about drugs was based on specific articulable facts and the reasonable inferences that could be drawn from those facts.State v. Van Dang, 2005-NMSC-033, 138 N.M. 408, 120 P.3d 830.\n\nNature of substance inferred.— Where all of the alleged marijuana was in the form of bricks having the same size, color and appearance as those tested, the fact finder could infer from the evidence that the remaining substance was the same as the tested portion.State v. Bowers, 1974-NMCA-135, 87 N.M. 74, 529 P.2d 300, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 29, 536 P.2d 1085 (1975).\n\nEvidence not inherently improbable.— Testimony in prosecution for unlawful sale and possession of marijuana was not inherently improbable despite fact that defendant was claimed to have insisted on delivering the cigarettes in question in the restroom where only he and undercover officer were present, yet afterwards supposedly received the money for the transaction and discussed other possible dealings in a car in the presence of several other persons.State v. Soliz, 1969-NMCA-043, 80 N.M. 297, 454 P.2d 779.\n\nEstablishing entrapment.— The necessity of having to resort to a greater degree of subterfuge, or to exercise more persistence, in making inquiries to set up an illegal sale of marijuana, without more, does not constitute evidence of illegal entrapment, nor is it necessary that a suspected crime be in the process of being committed in order to show a predisposition to commit that crime.State v. Akin, 1965-NMSC-078, 75 N.M. 308, 404 P.2d 134.\n\nSimilar offenses indicative of predisposition.— When the defense is entrapment, evidence of similar narcotics offenses bears on the defendant's predisposition, or readiness and willingness, to commit the offenses for which he is charged; and evidence of prior similar sales of heroin within a period shortly before those in question was admissible on the issue of entrapment.State v. Anaya, 1969-NMCA-120, 81 N.M. 52, 462 P.2d 637.\n\nEntrapment for the jury.— Defendant's testimony that he was having financial difficulties, with his wife expecting a baby and his daughter having problems, and that he considered agent's numerous requests that he obtain marijuana for a month or two before he finally agreed to involve himself, raised a factual issue as to whether the criminal conduct was the product of the agent's creative activity.State v. Martinez, 1971-NMCA-110, 83 N.M. 13, 487 P.2d 923.\n\nEntrapment not shown.— Suggestion that the act of officer in supplying the defendant with his favorite brand of whiskey constituted undue inducement was without merit where defendant not only dealt in the illegal sale of beer but also drank beer and whiskey of his own as well as that furnished by others.State v. Akin, 1965-NMSC-078, 75 N.M. 308, 404 P.2d 134.\n\nEvidence of knowledge and control.— Even if someone else had knowledge of the presence of marijuana in defendant's bedroom and exercised some control over it, defendant could also have had sufficient knowledge and control to be in constructive possession, and the link establishing defendant's knowledge and control was evidence of his commerce in illicit drugs.State v. Muniz, 1990-NMCA-105, 110 N.M. 799, 800 P.2d 734, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 749, 799 P.2d 1121.\n\nB. CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.\n\nInference of intent to distribute.— While there was no evidence of defendants' sale or an attempted sale of marijuana, the possession of 246.15 pounds of the substance, together with the defendants' activities, allowed the court to infer that the defendants had the necessary intent to distribute.State v. Bowers, 1974-NMCA-135, 87 N.M. 74, 529 P.2d 300, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 29, 536 P.2d 1085 (1975).\n\nEvidence of the amount of the cocaine possessed, about three grams, and evidence of the packaging and purity of the cocaine, as well as evidence that defendant had on his person a relatively large amount of cash, supported the state's argument that appellant intended to distribute the cocaine.Minner v. Kerby, 30 F.3d 1311 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\nC. SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.\n\nShared criminal intent.— Evidence regarding marijuana transaction established more than the mere presence of the defendant during the consummation of the sale, supporting a finding that he was in charge and directing the sale, or at least counseling, aiding and abetting in its consummation and sharing a criminal intent and purpose with the others.State v. Favela, 1968-NMCA-065, 79 N.M. 490, 444 P.2d 1001.\n\nEvidence of possession.— There was sufficient evidence for conviction since it was shown that the defendant was the owner of the premises from which the sale of illegal drugs was carried out in her presence and within her view.State v. Chandler, 1995-NMCA-033, 119 N.M. 727, 895 P.2d 249, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 617, 894 P.2d 394.\n\nConstructive possession and sale shown.— Evidence that witness bought six ounces of marijuana from defendant, who then gave witness detailed instructions as to the location of the drug behind a metal shack near the road leading to the airport, was ample evidence that defendant had constructive possession of and sold the marijuana to the witness.State v. Wesson, 1972-NMCA-013, 83 N.M. 480, 493 P.2d 965.\n\nTestimony of a single witness was sufficient evidence for convictionof unlawful possession and sale of marijuana.State v. Soliz, 1969-NMCA-043, 80 N.M. 297, 454 P.2d 779.\n\nModified trustworthiness standard did not apply to defendant's extrajudicial statements.— Where defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit drug trafficking by distribution, his pre-crime and course-of-crime statements were not subject to the modified trustworthiness standard, because the majority position views statements made prior to and in the course of the crime as bearing none of the indicia of unreliability as post-crime confessions and that there is little need for independent proof that the crime occurred as a safeguard against a conviction for an imagined crime where the defendant's statements at issue were made in the course of the crime.State v. Saiz, 2017-NMCA-072, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of conspiracy to commit trafficking by distribution.— Where defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit drug trafficking by distribution, defendant's statements assuring the undercover officer of the existence of an agreement to sell him methamphetamine and his actions attempting to achieve the sale were sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed conspiracy to commit drug trafficking by distribution, and it was irrelevant that defendant did not receive money from the undercover officer, no drugs were ever produced or verified, and no co-conspirator was ever seen, identified, or verified.State v. Saiz, 2017-NMCA-072, cert. denied.\n\nEvidence sufficient to find intent to distribute.— In prosecution for possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, based upon the record, where the state presented enough circumstantial evidence to support an inference of both knowledge and control, and therefore possession of methamphetamine, there was sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could have found that defendant intended to distribute that methamphetamine.State v. Barber, 2004-NMSC-019, 135 N.M. 621, 92 P.3d 633.\n\nEvidence sufficient to infer knowledge.— Defendant's conduct in selling pills, coupled with his assertion that they would get an undercover agent \"good and high,\" was sufficient evidence from which to infer defendant's knowledge of a controlled substance.State v. Martinez, 1986-NMCA-069, 104 N.M. 584, 725 P.2d 263.\n\nEvidence sufficient to support conviction.— Evidence, including defendant's exclusive control of the vehicle in which marijuana was found, his lies to the arresting officer, and his nervous demeanor were sufficient to allow a jury to find that he had knowledge of the marijuana.State v. Hernandez, 1998-NMCA-082, 125 N.M. 661, 964 P.2d 825.\n\nAn undercover agent's testimony that defendant sold him marijuana on two occasions was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for distributing marijuana.State v. Laskay, 1986-NMCA-008, 103 N.M. 799, 715 P.2d 72.\n\nDefendant's conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute was affirmed, where the evidence showed that: (1) the black book that defendant used for his drug transactions was kept in his residence, (2) defendant used the bedroom in which the marijuana was found at least to the extent of keeping his correspondence, including a bill for the pager used in his drug transactions, and (3) the marijuana found in a closet was packaged for distribution.State v. Muniz, 1990-NMCA-105, 110 N.M. 799, 800 P.2d 734, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 749, 799 P.2d 1121.\n\nEvidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute where he was in a closed bathroom alone with the drugs and paraphernalia, he had no clean clothes with him, and after five minutes in the bathroom, he had not taken a shower and there was no indication that he was planning to do so; additionally, the folded business card found on the toilet with a powdery substance in the crease and with handwritten notations of what appeared to have been drug transactions, connected defendant to the control over and distribution of the drugs.State v. Barber, 2003-NMCA-053, 133 N.M. 540, 65 P.3d 1095,aff'd, 2004-NMSC-019, 135 N.M. 621, 92 P.3d 633.\n\nSufficient evidence that chemicals were synthetic cannabinoids.— Where defendant was convicted of trafficking methamphetamine and distribution of synthetic cannabinoids based on evidence that an accomplice, at the direction of defendant, delivered methamphetamine and the chemicals PB-22 and 5F-PB22 hidden in deodorant sticks to an inmate confined in the Curry county detention center, and where defendant claimed that the state failed to prove that the substances were synthetic cannabinoids because the particular chemicals were not listed as controlled substances under the New Mexico Controlled Substances Act (CSA), there was sufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the chemicals collected from the deodorant sticks were \"synthetic cannabinoids\" within the meaning of this section where the state presented testimony from an expert in forensic chemistry that the chemicals PB-22 and 5F-PB22 are categorized as synthetic cannabinoids because while completely synthetic, the chemicals mimic the effects of cannabis.State v. Salazar, 2018-NMCA-030, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of distribution of synthetic cannabinoids.— Where defendant was charged with trafficking methamphetamine and distribution of synthetic cannabinoids after the state alleged that an accomplice, at the direction of defendant, delivered methamphetamine and synthetic cannabinoids hidden in deodorant sticks to an inmate confined in the Curry county detention center, there was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant's convictions beyond a reasonable doubt where the state presented evidence of recorded phone calls between defendant and the inmate where, according to testimony by the investigating officer, the two men used code words to discuss that defendant was going to obtain illegal narcotics by using the inmate's money from the jail, hide the narcotics in hygiene products, and send the hygiene products into the jail through a third person, and evidence that an inspection of the hygiene products at issue contained a green leafy substance and crystal-like substance wrapped in small baggies in the bottom of deodorant sticks, which were later identified as methamphetamine and synthetic cannabinoids.State v. Salazar, 2018-NMCA-030, cert. denied.\n\nV. JURY INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nInstructing on intent.— An instruction substantially in terms of the statute is sufficient.State v. Tucker, 1974-NMCA-049, 86 N.M. 553, 525 P.2d 913, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 528, 525 P.2d 888,overruled on other grounds byState v. Bender, 1978-NMSC-044, 91 N.M. 670, 579 P.2d 796.\n\nInstructions which are phrased in the terms of this statute were sufficient on element of intent.State v. Fuentes, 1973-NMCA-069, 85 N.M. 274, 511 P.2d 760, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 265, 511 P.2d 751.\n\nInstruction defining possession.— In prosecution for possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, although defendant would have been entitled to a jury instruction defining possession, absent defense counsel's request, the trial court was not required to provide the instruction sua sponte.State v. Barber, 2004-NMSC-019, 135 N.M. 621, 92 P.3d 633.\n\nPresumption of innocence.— In prosecution for unlawfully selling and unlawfully furnishing or giving away marijuana, it was error for the trial court to fail to instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence, where defendant requested an instruction thereon.State v. Henderson, 1970-NMCA-022, 81 N.M. 270, 466 P.2d 116.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Confusing Law of Criminal Intent in New Mexico,\" see 5 N.M. L. Rev. 63 (1974).\n\nAm.

deleted former Subsection B and redesignated former Subsections C through G as Subsections B through F, respectively; in Subsection C, Paragraph C(2), after \"Paragraphs\", changed \"(2) through (25)\" to \"(17) through (22)\"; in Subsection D, after \"Subsections B\", deleted \"C\" and after the next occurrence of \"and\", deleted \"G\" and added \"F\", and after \"Subsection\", changed \"F\" to \"E\"; and in Subsection F, after \"Subsection\", changed \"D\" to \"C\", in Paragraph F(1), after \"one ounce or less of\", deleted \"marijuana or\", in Paragraph F(2), after \"less than eight ounces of\", deleted \"marijuana or\", and in Paragraph F(3), after \"eight ounces or more of\", deleted \"marijuana or\".\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective June 18, 2021, eliminated the fine for possession of certain controlled substances committed by minors as a first offense, capped the number of hours of community service that may be imposed for minors who have committed the crime of possession of certain controlled substances as a first offense, and made technical changes;

and made minor stylistic changes throughout Subsection B.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nJury unanimity as to the form of cocaine involved in a lesser included offense of possession was not required.— Where police officers found crack cocaine in defendant's vehicle and powder cocaine that belonged to defendant in the vehicle of defendant's friend; defendant was charged with one count of trafficking and one count of the lesser included offense of possession; the jury found defendant guilty of possession of cocaine; defendant claimed that there were two substances at issue and that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that any conviction of possession had to be based on the same substance considered by the jury for the trafficking offense; the state's theories of possession were based on the crack cocaine found in defendant's vehicle and the powder cocaine found in the friend's vehicle; and witnesses testified that a lab analysis does not distinguish between crack cocaine and powder cocaine and that both forms of cocaine were in quantities large enough to qualify for a count of trafficking, jury unanimity was not required as to the specific form of cocaine involved, jury unanimity was required only on the overall verdict.State v. Godoy, 2012-NMCA-084, 284 P.3d 410, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-007.\n\nSection is within scope of state's power and is valid on its face.Yanez v. Romero, 619 F.2d 851 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 876, 101 S. Ct. 221, 66 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1980).\n\nPossession of heroin deemed felony under Habitual Offender Act.— When a federal conviction is had in New Mexico upon a purchase of heroin in New Mexico, the \"purchase\" of heroin necessarily includes the actual or constructive \"possession\" of heroin, and actual or constructive possession of heroin is a felony under the laws of New Mexico for purposes of the Habitual Offender Act.State v. Montoya, 1980-NMSC-093, 94 N.M. 704, 616 P.2d 417.\n\nHabitual offender law inapplicable.— Since the legislature intended an enhanced penalty to apply to a violation of the Controlled Substances Act it so provided within the act, the legislature did not intend that the habitual offender law was to apply to second or subsequent violations of Subsection B(5) (now D) of this section.State v. Alderete, 1975-NMCA-080, 88 N.M. 150, 538 P.2d 422.\n\nComparison not warranted.— Former Narcotic Drug Act (54-7-1, 1953 Comp. et seq.) was completely lacking in any legislative direction as to procedures in the event of second or subsequent convictions, and a comparison between the Narcotic Drug Act and former habitual criminal law was of no value.State v. Rhodes, 1966-NMSC-064, 76 N.M. 177, 413 P.2d 214.\n\nDue process certainty.— The language of definitional Section 30-31-20 NMSA 1978 (now 30-31-2N NMSA 1978), referring to all parts of the cannabis plant whether growing or not, coupled with Subsection B(3) of this section, is not so indefinite that men of common intelligence must guess at its meaning and scope.State v. Olive, 1973-NMCA-131, 85 N.M. 664, 515 P.2d 668, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 639, 515 P.2d 643.\n\nEqual protection.— Fact that the Controlled Substances Act does not specifically state when weighing of marijuana is to be done does not mean that Subsection B(3) of this section, as applied to defendant convicted of possession of more than eight ounces of \"green\" marijuana, was a violation of his rights to equal protection since it was the possession of marijuana, on the date of the offense, which was the prohibited act and not the amount in some subsequent form suitable to a particular defendant.State v. Olive, 1973-NMCA-131, 85 N.M. 664, 515 P.2d 668, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 639, 515 P.2d 643.\n\nDue process requirements in sentence enhancement.— To meet due process requirements of essential fairness in sentencing defendant for a second drug offense, there must be some pleading filed by the state, whether by motion or otherwise, by which defendant is given notice of the state's charges, and defendant must be given an opportunity to be heard on the charges before an increased penalty can be imposed.State v. Rhodes, 1966-NMSC-064, 76 N.M. 177, 413 P.2d 214.\n\nTitle constitutionally adequate.— Sections 30-31-20 to 30-31-25 NMSA 1978, which define unlawful activities and provide penalties therefor, are not unconstitutional on the grounds that \"unlawful activities\" are not mentioned in the title of the act.State v. Atencio, 1973-NMCA-110, 85 N.M. 484, 513 P.2d 1266, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 483, 513 P.2d 1265.\n\nStanding to challenge section.— Defendant's contention that this section violated his constitutional rights because he was a narcotic addict, where there was no evidence that he was an addict, was without merit.State v. Jaramillo, 1975-NMCA-091, 88 N.M. 179, 538 P.2d 1201.\n\nMarijuana use not intrinsic part of religion.— Where the evidence shows that defendant's belief was derived from defendant's personal views of the bible, and those views under the evidence are no more than that the use and distribution of marijuana was permitted because marijuana is a gift from God, such a personal use does not amount to an intrinsic part of a religion.State v. Brashear, 1979-NMCA-027, 92 N.M. 622, 593 P.2d 63.\n\nPossession of narcotics, not addiction can be subject of prosecution.— Addiction is a disease which cannot be the subject of prosecution under the eighth and fourteenth amendments of the United States constitution: possession of narcotics as a crime is valid and distinguishable.Yanez v. Romero, 619 F.2d 851 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 876, 101 S. Ct. 221, 66 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1980).\n\nLegal to search defendant admitting \"dope\" possession.— Once the defendant voluntarily made the statement that there was \"dope\" in his pocket, a police officer had probable cause to believe that a crime was being committed, specifically, possession of a controlled substance. This provided a proper legal foundation for both a full search and the actual arrest of the defendant.State v. Blakely, 1993-NMCA-053, 115 N.M. 466, 853 P.2d 168, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 535, 854 P.2d 362.\n\nII. ELEMENTS OF POSSESSION.\n\nPossession.— Mere proximity to illegal drugs, mere presence on the property where they are located, or mere association with persons who do control them, without more, is insufficient to support a finding of possession.United States v. Espinosa, 771 F.2d 1382 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1023, 106 S.Ct. 579, 88 L. Ed. 2d 561 (1985).\n\nPossession and tampering distinguished.— Possession of a controlled substance requires proof defendant knew or believed it was cocaine or some other substance that is regulated, which is not required to prove tampering, while tampering with evidence requires proof defendant intended to prevent the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of herself or others, which is not required to prove possession.State v. Franco, 2005-NMSC-013, 137 N.M. 447, 112 P.3d 1104.\n\nPossession of a controlled substance can be committed without tampering with evidence. Conversely, tampering with evidence, even if the evidence is illegal drugs, can be committed without possessing the drugs.State v. Franco, 2005-NMSC-013, 137 N.M. 447, 112 P.3d 1104.\n\nProhibition of \"use\" not vague.— Former section prohibiting \"unlawful use\" of marijuana was not unconstitutionally vague, since all use of marijuana not falling within a stated exception was made unlawful.State v. Covens, 1971-NMCA-141, 83 N.M. 175, 489 P.2d 888 (decided under prior law).\n\nMeaning of \"eight ounces\".— Weight of eight ounces mentioned in Subsection B(3) of this section means the weight of the plant, or the plant's derivative products, weighed in the form seized, whether that form be the green plant, the dried plant or the various products which may be derived from the plant.State v. Olive, 1973-NMCA-131, 85 N.M. 664, 515 P.2d 668, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 639, 515 P.2d 643.\n\nIntent required.— Under 54-5-16, 1953 Comp. (now repealed), an intent to possess anhalonium (peyote) was required for conviction.State v. Pedro, 1971-NMCA-145, 83 N.M. 212, 490 P.2d 470 (decided under prior law, statute repealed).\n\nLocus of offense jurisdictional.— Since state in prosecution for unlawful use of heroin failed to establish where defendant used the narcotic, an essential element of the offense charged, this jurisdictional error would be raised sua sponte by the appellate court and defendant's conviction reversed for failure of proof.State v. Losolla, 1972-NMCA-085, 84 N.M. 151, 500 P.2d 436.\n\nPossession coupled with knowledge.— The state must prove that defendant had physical or constructive possession, coupled with knowledge of the presence and narcotic character of the substance possessed.State v. Bowers, 1974-NMCA-135, 87 N.M. 74, 529 P.2d 300, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 29, 536 P.2d 1085 (1975);State v. Baca, 1974-NMCA-098, 87 N.M. 12, 528 P.2d 656, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 5, 528 P.2d 649;State v. Bauske, 1974-NMCA-078, 86 N.M. 484, 525 P.2d 411;State v. Mosier, 1971-NMCA-138, 83 N.M. 213, 490 P.2d 471;State v. Maes, 1970-NMCA-053, 81 N.M. 550, 469 P.2d 529, cert. denied,sub nom.State v. Felix, 81 N.M. 588, 470 P.2d 309 (1970).\n\nPossession means care, control and managementon the occasion in question.State v. Mosier, 1971-NMCA-138, 83 N.M. 213, 490 P.2d 471;State v. Maes, 1970-NMCA-053, 81 N.M. 550, 469 P.2d 529, cert. denied,sub nom.State v. Felix, 81 N.M. 588, 470 P.2d 309 (1970).\n\nConstructive possession defined.— Constructive possession exists when the accused has knowledge of the presence of the narcotic and control over it.State v. Bowers, 1974-NMCA-135, 87 N.M. 74, 529 P.2d 300, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 29, 536 P.2d 1085 (1975);State v. Montoya, 1973-NMCA-060, 85 N.M. 126, 509 P.2d 893.\n\nExclusive possession is not required to support a conviction.State v. Favela, 1968-NMCA-065, 79 N.M. 490, 444 P.2d 1001.\n\nIII. DOUBLE JEOPARDY.\n\nSubsection A of this section defines the unit of prosecution for a person in simultaneous possession of each distinct controlled substance.— Where defendant was a passenger in a vehicle that was the subject of a traffic stop, during which it was revealed that defendant had an outstanding warrant for her arrest, and where, during a search incident to arrest and an inventory search of the vehicle, the officer found a clear bag containing a substance that tested positive for heroin, a bag containing a substance that tested positive for methamphetamine, and a clear glass pipe, and where defendant was charged with two counts of possession of a controlled substance, one for possession of heroin and one for possession of methamphetamine, and where the district court, prior to trial, granted defendant's motion to dismiss the second count of possession of a controlled substance, finding that defendant can only be charged with one count of possession, concluding that § 30-31-23 NMSA 1978 does not define the unit of prosecution and defendant's acts of possession were not sufficiently distinct to support two charges, the district court erred in finding that § 30-31-23 does not define the unit of prosecution, because the plain language of § 30-31-23(A) defines the unit of prosecution for a person in simultaneous possession of each distinct controlled substance. Defendant's separate charges for the simultaneous possession of two distinct controlled substances did not violate defendant's double jeopardy rights.State v. Garcia, 2022-NMCA-051, cert. denied.\n\nPossession of methamphetamine and possession of drug paraphernalia .— The legislature did not intend to punish a defendant for possession of a controlled substance and possession of paraphernalia when the paraphernalia consists of only a container that is storing a personal supply of the charged controlled substance and where the defendant was convicted of possession of methamphetamine and possession of drug paraphernalia based on the possession of a baggie that held the methamphetamine, the defendant's conviction of possession of drug paraphernalia violated double jeopardy.State v. Almeida, 2008-NMCA-068, 144 N.M. 235, 185 P.3d 1085.\n\nPossession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia.— Where police responded to a report that someone was trying to kick in the door of an apartment and encountered defendant at the scene, apparently agitated and yelling loudly, and where, after placing defendant under arrest for disorderly conduct, the officers found a clear glass pipe containing a white crystalline residue, which later tested positive for methamphetamine, in defendant's left front pocket, and where defendant claimed that his convictions for possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia based on unitary conduct violate double jeopardy, the fact that defendant's convictions required proof of distinct elements, knowing possession of methamphetamine versus possession of paraphernalia with the intent to use it, gave rise to the presumption that the legislature intended to punish the offenses separately, and defendant failed to overcome this presumption.State v. Moncayo, 2022-NMCA-067, cert. granted.\n\nLesser included offense.— The separate crimes of possession of methamphetamine and possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute apply in the alternative when based on a single act of possession.State v. Quick, 2009-NMSC-015, 146 N.M. 80, 206 P.3d 985.\n\nPossession of methamphetamine is a lesser included charge of possession with intent to distributemethamphetamine and a conviction of both charges when defendant's conduct was unitary is a violation of double jeopardy.State v. Lopez, 2008-NMCA-002, 143 N.M. 274, 175 P.3d 942, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-007, 144 N.M. 593, 189 P.3d 1215.\n\nPossession is lesser offense necessarily included in distribution of marijuana.State v. Medina, 1975-NMCA-033, 87 N.M. 394, 534 P.2d 486.\n\nDistribution prosecution barred by conviction of possession.— The possession of marijuana was a lesser offense necessarily included in the greater offense of distribution of marijuana, and since the defendant was convicted of the lesser offense, the principles of double jeopardy barred the subsequent prosecution of the greater offense.State v. Medina, 1975-NMCA-033, 87 N.M. 394, 534 P.2d 486.\n\nRetrial for possession barred.— Since two counts were charged in an indictment, one for illegal possession of marijuana and the other for possession with intent to sell, an instruction by the court that the jury was to disregard the possession count if it found defendant guilty of the latter offense operated as an acquittal on the possession count and prevented retrial of this issue when the verdict on possession with intent to distribute was overturned.State v. Moreno, 1961-NMSC-070, 69 N.M. 113, 364 P.2d 594.\n\nNo double jeopardy violation.— Convictions for possession of cocaine and tampering with evidence did not violate defendant's double jeopardy rights.State v. Franco, 2005-NMSC-013, 137 N.M. 447, 112 P.3d 1104.\n\nIV. EVIDENCE AND PROOF.\n\nAuthentication of substance as cocaine by lay testimony.— Where defendant was charged with trafficking and the lesser included offense of possession of cocaine; the state failed to present a laboratory analysis authenticating the substance found in defendant's vehicle as crack cocaine; when arrested, defendant raised the inference that the substance was an illegal narcotic by telling the arresting police officers that defendant was the user and that the substance was for defendant's personal use; three officers testified that the substance field tested for the presence of cocaine; one officer testified that the result of the test was positive; and two officers testified that based on their experience and training, the substance had the appearance of crack cocaine, the officers' opinions, combined with the actions and statements of defendant, provided sufficient evidence to support the admissibility of the crack cocaine into evidence.State v. Godoy, 2012-NMCA-084, 284 P.3d 410, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-007.\n\nField drug test.— The state has the burden to establish the validity of the scientific principles on which a field drug test is based and its scientific reliability when the state elects to rely on a field test to prove the identity of contraband. The testimony by a law enforcement officer will not, without more, be sufficient to support admission of the results, when the officer cannot explain the scientific principles that the test uses, the percentage of false positives or negatives that the test will produce, or the factors that may produce those false results. The state can avoid admissibility problems altogether by using a competent laboratory to identify the substance at issue.State v. Morales, 2002-NMCA-052, 132 N.M. 146, 45 P.3d 406, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 193, 46 P.3d 100.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nTestimony concerning a forensic laboratory report.— Where the court admitted a forensic laboratory report that a substance was cocaine; the report was admitted into evidence through the testimony of a forensic chemist who did not conduct the tests underlying the report; the witness's testimony was an explanation regarding how the test was performed and the witness's approval of the testing chemist's results; there was nothing in the witness's testimony indicating that the witness relied on the witness's own analysis to arrive at the witness's own conclusions; the only other evidence that the substance was cocaine was the testimony of a police officer who performed a field test on the substance; and the state failed to prove the scientific reliability of the field test, the admission of the laboratory report and the witness's testimony regarding the testing chemist's opinion was error, the error was not harmless, and the error violated defendant's right of confrontation.State v. Delgado, 2010-NMCA-078, 148 N.M. 870, 242 P.3d 437, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-007, 148 N.M. 610, 241 P.3d 611, on remand of 2009-NMCA-061, 146 N.M. 402, 210 P.3d 828, cert granted, 2009-NMCERT-006, 146 N.M. 733, 215 P.3d 42.\n\nChain of custody.— Where, during a search incident to arrest, the arresting police officer found on defendant a plastic \"bindle\" containing a white crystalline substance which the officer recognized as methamphetamine; the arresting officer observed another officer perform a presumptive field test on the substance; the arresting officer took the substance into evidence and transferred the substance to an evidence technician who sent the substance to the sate laboratory; an analyst in the drug analysis unit obtained the evidence from the laboratory's evidence custodian; the analyst performed two tests on the evidence and concluded that the substance was methamphetamine; the analyst sealed the evidence so that it would be apparent if any one tried to tamper with or alter it and returned the evidence to the evidence custodian, there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict that the substance seized from defendant was the same substance that was tested by the state laboratory and determined to be methamphetamine.State v. Rodriguez, 2009-NMCA-090, 146 N.M. 824, 215 P.3d 762, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 361, 223 P.3d 358.\n\nPurchaser not guilty of solicitation to traffic.— Even though the defendant's actions in negotiating for the purchase of drugs fall within the definition of criminal solicitation, his conduct was necessarily incidental to the crime of trafficking through the sale of a controlled substance and he could not be guilty of solicitation to traffic.State v. Pinson, 1995-NMCA-045, 119 N.M. 752, 895 P.2d 274.\n\nProof of possession of controlled substancemay be established by evidence of the conduct and actions of a defendant, and by circumstantial evidence connecting the defendant with the crime.State v. Donaldson, 1983-NMCA-064, 100 N.M. 111, 666 P.2d 1258, cert. denied, 100 N.M. 53, 665 P.2d 809.\n\nEvidence of possession.— When an accused is not in exclusive possession of the places in which an illegal substance is found, the state is required to prove that the accused knew the substance was there and that the accused exercised control over it.State v. Morales, 2002-NMCA-052, 132 N.M. 146, 45 P.3d 406, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 193, 46 P.3d 100.\n\nDirect proof unnecessary.— Proof of possession with knowledge of narcotic character need not be by direct or uncontradicted evidence.State v. Garcia, 1966-NMSC-063, 76 N.M. 171, 413 P.2d 210,overruled on other grounds byState v. Gomez, 1997-NMSC-006, 122 N.M. 777, 932 P.2d 1.\n\nTrace amount not sufficient to infer knowledge.— The presence of a trace amount of cocaine in a cellophane cigarette wrapper carried in defendant's pocket was not, by itself, sufficient to establish that defendant had knowledge of the substance or that the substance was cocaine.State v. Reed, 1998-NMSC-030, 125 N.M. 552, 964 P.2d 113.\n\nConduct permitting inference of guilt.— Evidence sufficient to support a violation of this section must be such as discloses some conduct, declarations or actions on the part of the accused from which the fact finder may fairly infer and which is sufficient to satisfy it beyond a reasonable doubt of knowledge in the accused of the presence and nature of the narcotics.Doe v. State, 1975-NMCA-108, 88 N.M. 347, 540 P.2d 827, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248;State v. Garcia, 1966-NMSC-063, 76 N.M. 171, 413 P.2d 210,overruled on other grounds byState v. Gomez, 1997-NMSC-006, 122 N.M. 777, 932 P.2d 1.\n\nProving knowing possession.— To show knowing possession of narcotics, the conduct and behavior of the parties, their admissions or contradictory statements and explanations are frequently sufficient; possession and knowledge that object is a narcotic drug can also be proven circumstantially.State v. Baca, 1974-NMCA-098, 87 N.M. 12, 528 P.2d 656, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 5, 528 P.2d 649.\n\nRight to control.— An accused has constructive possession when he maintains control or a right to control the contraband.State v. Bauske, 1974-NMCA-078, 86 N.M. 484, 525 P.2d 411.\n\nPower to produce or dispose is evidence of control.State v. Montoya, 1973-NMCA-060, 85 N.M. 126, 509 P.2d 893.\n\nInsufficiency of positive drug test by itself.— The common law rule in New Mexico requires additional proof of an intentional or knowing prior possession corroborating a positive drug test before a defendant can be charged and convicted of possession of a controlled substance; while a positive drug test might be circumstantial evidence of possession, it is insufficient, standing alone, to convict for that crime.State v. McCoy, 1993-NMCA-064, 116 N.M. 491, 864 P.2d 307,rev'd in part on other groundssub nom.State v. Hodge, 1994-NMSC-087, 118 N.M. 410, 882 P.2d 1.\n\nNo burden on state to negate plant maturity.— In prosecution for possession, the state was not required to expressly prove that substance identified as marijuana was not the mature stalk.State v. Everidge, 1967-NMSC-035, 77 N.M. 505, 424 P.2d 787, cert. denied, sub nom. Greene v. United States, 386 U.S. 976, 87 S. Ct. 1171, 18 L. Ed. 2d 136 (1967).\n\nFailure to prove plant maturity is fatal.— Since the state's expert witness was unable to say whether the substance he tested was cannabis indica or cannabis sativa L., and could only identify it as mature stalk of some kind of cannabis, possession of which mature stalk did not constitute a violation of the statute under which the state had elected to proceed, defendant's conviction for possession of marijuana would be reversed.State v. Benavidez, 1962-NMSC-137, 71 N.M. 19, 375 P.2d 333 (decided under prior law).\n\nEvidence of predisposition.— In view of evidence that defendant, a heroin addict, had been brought off methadone rapidly when a methadone maintenance program was closed, that he encountered a waiting requirement for entry into a different methadone program, during which time he contacted his former heroin supplier (now an informer) who supplied him with heroin, and that defendant being utterly without funds, the two arranged a marijuana transaction during the course of which defendant was arrested, subsequently being convicted of unlawful possession, the jury could reasonably have believed that the parties pooled their thoughts to plan a criminal enterprise in which the defendant was predisposed to participate.State v. Fiechter, 1976-NMSC-006, 89 N.M. 74, 547 P.2d 557.\n\nEntrapment for the jury.— Evidence that defendant had previously been involved in \"hauling\" marijuana, that he had furnished informer with LSD in the past and that he himself had taken drugs went toward defendant's predisposition to commit the crime and bore on the credibility of his testimony that representations by informer involving thereto and violence were the inducing cause of the crime (possession of LSD); and since there were conflicts on the entrapment issue, the trial court properly refused to rule there was entrapment as a matter of law.State v. Sena, 1971-NMCA-044, 82 N.M. 513, 484 P.2d 355.\n\n\"Ingestion\" not possession.— The mere presence of drugs in the urine or bloodstream does not constitute possession.State v. McCoy, 1993-NMCA-064, 116 N.M. 491, 864 P.2d 307,rev'd in part on other groundssub nom.State v. Hodge, 1994-NMSC-087, 118 N.M. 410, 882 P.2d 1.\n\nTo convict the defendant of possession of cocaine that he had ingested, it is necessary to prove that he voluntarily and knowingly ingested the drug in New Mexico.State v. Franks, 1994-NMCA-097, 119 N.M. 174, 889 P.2d 209.\n\nPossession through ingestion.— The defendant's statement that he took cocaine was probative of the offense since the fact that he thought that cocaine was present in his body tended to establish that: (1) cocaine was present in his body, (2) he knew that it was cocaine when he ingested it, and (3) the ingestion was voluntary.State v. Franks, 1994-NMCA-097, 119 N.M. 174, 889 P.2d 209.\n\nEvidence sufficient for convictionincludes any clearly identifiable amount of controlled substances.State v. Wood, 1994-NMCA-060, 117 N.M. 682, 875 P.2d 1113, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 744, 877 P.2d 44.\n\nEvidence not inherently improbable.— Testimony in prosecution for unlawful sale and possession of marijuana was not inherently improbable despite fact that defendant was claimed to have insisted on delivering the cigarettes in question in the restroom where only he and undercover officer were present, yet afterwards supposedly received the money for the transaction and discussed other possible dealings in a car in the presence of several other persons.State v. Soliz, 1969-NMCA-043, 80 N.M. 297, 454 P.2d 779.\n\nPrejudicial hearsay.— Testimony by undercover officer that defendant's name had been called to his attention by local officers as a person allegedly dealing in marijuana was clearly hearsay and clearly prejudicial and necessitated reversal of her conviction for possession of marijuana.State v. Alberts, 1969-NMCA-064, 80 N.M. 472, 457 P.2d 991.\n\nB. CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.\n\nInference of possession permissible from exclusive possession.— When one has exclusive possession of a home or apartment in which narcotics are found, it may be inferred, even in the absence of other incriminating evidence, that such person knew of the presence of the narcotics and had control of them.State v. Baca, 1974-NMCA-098, 87 N.M. 12, 528 P.2d 656, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 5, 528 P.2d 649.\n\nNonexclusive possession distinguished.— When a person is not in exclusive possession of premises, it may not be inferred that he knew of the presence of the marijuana (or narcotics) or had control over same unless there are some other incriminating circumstances or statements tending to buttress such an inference.State v. Bidegain, 1975-NMCA-065, 88 N.M. 384, 540 P.2d 864,rev'd in part on other grounds, 1975-NMSC-060, 88 N.M. 466, 541 P.2d 971;State v. Bowers, 1974-NMCA-135, 87 N.M. 74, 529 P.2d 300, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 29, 536 P.2d 1085;State v. Baca, 1974-NMCA-098, 87 N.M. 12, 528 P.2d 656, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 5, 528 P.2d 649.\n\nSince defendant's wife resided with him, he was not in exclusive possession of the premises, and an inference of constructive possession could not be drawn against him unless there were incriminating statements or circumstances tending to support the inference.State v. Herrera, 1977-NMCA-028, 90 N.M. 306, 563 P.2d 100, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 636, 567 P.2d 485.\n\nPossession of agent.— An accused has constructive possession of narcotics found in the physical possession of his agent or any other person when the defendant has the immediate right to exercise dominion and control over the narcotics.State v. Bauske, 1974-NMCA-078, 86 N.M. 484, 525 P.2d 411.\n\nConstructive possession shown.— Where police officers found crack cocaine in defendant's vehicle and powder cocaine in the vehicle of defendant's friend; and defendant's friend testified that the powder cocaine belonged to defendant and that the friend had agreed to transport the powder cocaine to defendant's house and to take the blame if they were caught, the evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant constructively possessed the powder cocaine found in the vehicle of defendant's friend because defendant knew or believed that the substance was cocaine and defendant knew where the cocaine was located and exercised control over it.State v. Godoy, 2012-NMCA-084, 284 P.3d 410, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-007.\n\nFinding of numerous unused tinfoils inside the house occupied by defendant and his wife and fact that on the way to the police station, when defendant's wife remarked that the police got everything that \"we had,\" defendant told his wife to keep her mouth shut, were sufficient to sustain the inference that defendant constructively possessed the heroin that was found outside.State v. Herrera, 1977-NMCA-028, 90 N.M. 306, 563 P.2d 100, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 636, 567 P.2d 485.\n\nA showing that heroin was found in the bathroom of the master bedroom usually occupied by defendant and his wife, that defendant was a former heroin addict who for the last three years had been undergoing methadone treatments and according to his own testimony took methadone daily and that the wife claimed to have never seen heroin and other items before and not to know what they were used for, constituted substantial evidence of defendant's constructive knowledge and possession of the heroin.State v. Baca, 1974-NMCA-098, 87 N.M. 12, 528 P.2d 656, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 5, 528 P.2d 649.\n\nEvidence was sufficient to find that defendant constructively possessed an eyeglass case left under patrol car seat by his wife, knowing it contained heroin, where it took defendant three blocks to stop his car for the police, various parts of the fix kit were found in the car trunk and in the eyeglass case, including a syringe with defendant's fingerprint, his wife's purse held squares of tinfoil and there were fresh needle marks on defendant's arm.State v. Bauske, 1974-NMCA-078, 86 N.M. 484, 525 P.2d 411.\n\nThere was sufficient evidence to show constructive possession of controlled substance with knowledge thereof where defendant was in possession of a motel room for six days before a legal search of that room revealed heroin.State v. Montoya, 1973-NMCA-060, 85 N.M. 126, 509 P.2d 893.\n\nConstructive possession of cocaine was shown based on evidence that the defendant owned and had control of the car she was traveling in with her daughter, the daughter had cocaine concealed on her person, the daughter was easily influenced to do wrong, and the defendant insisted that police arrest her instead of her daughter.State v. Hernandez, 1997-NMCA-006, 122 N.M. 809, 932 P.2d 499.\n\nEven though defendant did not have exclusive possession of the bedroom where drugs and paraphernalia were discovered, physical evidence and her own incriminating statements rationally supported the necessary inferences to find her guilty of criminal possession.State v. Phillips, 2000-NMCA-028, 128 N.M. 777, 999 P.2d 421, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 689, 997 P.2d 821.\n\nC. SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.\n\nSubstantial evidence of possession.— Where the defendant was bent down behind a fence; when police officers approached, the defendant stood up and walked toward a shed; the defendant did not stop when the officers called out to the defendant; the defendant's body movements appeared as if the defendant had disposed of something; the defendant then walked back to the officers; the officers found a bag of cocaine in front of the shed; and when the cocaine was found, the defendant placed the defendant's hands behind the defendant's back and turned around without any request by the officers, there was sufficient evidence that the defendant had consecutive possession of the cocaine.State v. Delgado, 2009-NMCA-061, 146 N.M. 402, 210 P.3d 828, cert. granted, 2009-NMCERT-006, 146 N.M. 734, 215 P.3d 43, remanded, 2010-NMCA-078, 148 N.M. 870, 242 P.3d 437, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-007, 148 N.M. 610, 241 P.3d 611.\n\nPlace of possession.— Defendant's conviction for possession of cocaine warranted reversal since there was insufficient evidence to prove that the drugs were actually possessed and ingested in New Mexico, although the defendant's urine tested positive for cocaine.State v. McCoy, 1993-NMCA-064, 116 N.M. 491, 864 P.2d 307,rev'd in part on other groundssub nom.State v. Hodge, 1994-NMSC-087, 118 N.M. 410, 882 P.2d 1.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where police officers testified that they found a glass pipe containing a white substance in the center console of the vehicle defendant was driving and subsequent forensic testing revealed that the substance was methamphetamine, the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant possessed or constructively possessed the methamphetamine and the pipe and to permit the jury to infer that defendant knew that the substance was methamphetamine and that defendant intended to use the pipe to inhale methamphetamine.State v. Lopez, 2009-NMCA-127, 147 N.M. 364, 223 P.3d 361, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-010, 147 N.M. 452, 224 P.3d 1257.\n\nA trace amount of a controlled substance is sufficient to support a conviction for possession.— Where police responded to a report that someone was trying to kick in the door of an apartment and encountered defendant at the scene, apparently agitated and yelling loudly, and where, after placing defendant under arrest for disorderly conduct, the officers found a clear glass pipe containing a white crystalline residue, which later tested positive for methamphetamine, in defendant's left front pocket, and where defendant challenged the sufficiency of evidence of a trace amount of a controlled substance found inside a glass pipe to support a conviction for possession of methamphetamine, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction, because the legislature intended possession of any amount of a controlled substance to violate, § 30-31-23(E) NMSA 1978, and the state's evidence conclusively established that defendant was in possession of a clear glass pipe containing the white crystalline residue that proved to be methamphetamine. Moreover, defendant's possession of a glass pipe in his pocket, with a visible white residue inside the pipe, was sufficient to create a reasonable inference that defendant knew that the residue was a controlled substance.State v. Moncayo, 2022-NMCA-067, cert. granted.\n\nSubstantial evidence of possession.— Evidence that a voice identified as female defendant's responded to the officers' knock, that thereafter running was heard from the front portion of the trailer to the vicinity of the trailer in which the bathrooms were located, that the toilet was flushed and heroin was recovered therefrom immediately thereafter, and that upon entry the officers found the defendant standing in a location consistent with her having been the person who flushed the toilet, along with evidence that the other occupants of the trailer were infants and young children, two sleeping adults and another adult in the living room, was substantial and supported defendant's conviction for possession of heroin.State v. Anaya, 1976-NMCA-055, 89 N.M. 302, 551 P.2d 992.\n\nSufficient evidence of possession of controlled substances.— Where defendant was arrested for driving on a revoked license, and where the arresting officer found on defendant's person ninety-seven empty small baggies and a straw with a burnt end, items which are commonly used to package methamphetamine, a small plastic bag with a white powdery substance, later identified as methamphetamine, and found in defendant's vehicle three additional baggies that contained what was identified in a field test as methamphetamine, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of possession of methamphetamine.State v. Tidey, 2018-NMCA-014, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of possession of methamphetamine.— Evidence that the arresting officer discovered methamphetamine in a pack of cigarettes removed from defendant's shirt pocket was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for possession of controlled substances.State v. Howl, 2016-NMCA-084, cert. denied.\n\nSufficiency of evidence.— Evidence that defendant knowingly transferred a forged prescription was sufficient to sustain a conviction for knowingly possessing the drug involved.State v. Nation, 1973-NMCA-087, 85 N.M. 291, 511 P.2d 777.\n\nAppellant's acts of purchasing the cigarettes, receiving actual delivery thereof and then distributing them amply supported the conclusion that he had marijuana in his possession, as such term was defined in the instructions.State v. Romero, 1968-NMCA-078, 79 N.M. 522, 445 P.2d 587.\n\nSufficient evidence of joint dominion and control of drugs and drug paraphernalia.— Where defendant was charged with homicide by vehicle (driving while under the influence of drugs), causing great bodily injury (driving while under the influence of drugs), possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of marijuana following a car collision in which defendant was the driver and where defendant's passenger, the owner of the vehicle that defendant was driving, was killed and another driver was severely injured, and where investigators discovered marijuana and drug paraphernalia in the vehicle defendant was driving, and where defendant implied that the evidence was equally consistent with his passenger possessing the marijuana or others having deposited the marijuana in the vehicle, there was sufficient evidence to permit a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the marijuana based on evidence that the marijuana and drug paraphernalia were in a location subject to the joint dominion and control of defendant and his passenger, and witness testimony that the marijuana leaves and drug paraphernalia were in the vehicle prior to police arriving on the scene.State v. Martinez, 2020-NMCA-043, cert. denied.\n\nEvidence of possession insufficient.— Evidence that one defendant was in bed asleep when the officers entered the trailer, that plastic baggie tops were found on top of the commode in the bathroom off the bedroom where he was sleeping and that after his arrest defendant asked another man in the trailer to do him an unidentified favor was insufficient to sustain his conviction for possession of heroin flushed down a toilet by someone in the trailer.State v. Anaya, 1976-NMCA-055, 89 N.M. 302, 551 P.2d 992.\n\nSince there was no evidence that female defendant had any control over the keys to the car in which she was riding or to the footlockers in its trunk, or that she had any knowledge whatsoever of the contents of the car trunk, it was held that the evidence relied upon to sustain her conviction was totally insubstantial.State v. Bidegain, 1975-NMCA-065, 88 N.M. 384, 540 P.2d 864,rev'd in part on other grounds, 1975-NMSC-060, 88 N.M. 466, 541 P.2d 971.\n\nWhere the only evidence concerning cocaine was that some was found in a vial in a box on the coffee table of the main room of defendants' house, and there was no testimony that any of the defendants knew of the contents of the vial or of its character, nor evidence that any of the defendants had the power to produce or dispose of the narcotic in question, nor any evidence that the defendants had any common purpose in the cocaine which was found, the trial court erred in finding that there was sufficient evidence to convict the defendants for possession of cocaine.State v. Bowers, 1974-NMCA-135, 87 N.M. 74, 529 P.2d 300, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 29, 536 P.2d 1085 (1975).\n\nInsufficient evidence that substance was synthetic cannabinoid.— Where defendant was arrested and charged with a single count of possession of synthetic cannabinoids, and where defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction because the state failed to meet its burden of proving that the substance in his possession was a synthetic cannabinoid, there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction where the state failed to introduce evidence that scientific testing was ever done to determine what chemicals were present in or applied to the substance found in defendant's possession, and therefore could not prove that the substance contained a chemical that falls either into one of the classes of chemicals listed in a statute or regulation or within the neurochemical definition of synthetic cannabinoid.State v. Arias, 2018-NMCA-057.\n\nIgnorance of nature of substance.— Evidence that defendant, an Arapahoe Indian, after treatment for illness by an \"Indian doctor,\" was given \"medicine\" to carry on his person as \"protection,\" which medicine, unknown to defendant, was anhalonium (or peyote), could not support a conviction for possession of the substance.State v. Pedro, 1971-NMCA-145, 83 N.M. 212, 490 P.2d 470.\n\nKnowledge not shown.— A degree of furtiveness on the part of juveniles in smoking and passing a pipe around between buildings while changing classes, in light of a school regulation prohibiting the smoking of tobacco, was not conduct sufficient to infer that the smokers knew the character of the substance they were using.Doe v. State, 1975-NMCA-108, 88 N.M. 347, 540 P.2d 827, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nTestimony of a single witness was sufficient evidencefor a conviction of unlawful possession and sale of marijuana.State v. Soliz, 1969-NMCA-043, 80 N.M. 297, 454 P.2d 779.\n\nV. INDICTMENT AND INFORMATION.\n\nInformation and proof not variant.— Information charging defendant with unlawful possession of \"certain narcotic drugs, to-wit, cannabis indica, also known as marijuana\" was not at fatal variance with proof of possession of leaves and seeds of \"marijuana,\" despite fact that there was no testimony identifying the substance by true botanical name or referring to its chemical breakdown or grouping.State v. Romero, 1964-NMSC-245, 74 N.M. 642, 397 P.2d 26.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note and comment, \"State v. Urioste: A Prosecutor's Dream and Defender's Nightmare,\" see 34 N.M. L.

The provisions of this subsection do not apply to a person who is in possession of:\n\n(1) hypodermic syringes or needles for the purpose of participation in or administration of the Harm Reduction Act [24-2C-1 to 24-2C-6 NMSA 1978];\n\n(2) supplies or devices obtained pursuant to the Harm Reduction Act in accordance with rules established by the department of health for the harm reduction program; or\n\n(3) supplies or devices used for the testing of controlled substances or controlled substance analogs for dangerous adulterants.\n\nB. It is unlawful for a person to deliver, possess with intent to deliver or manufacture with the intent to deliver drug paraphernalia with knowledge, or under circumstances where one reasonably should know, that it will be used to plant, propagate, cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, convert, produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, store, contain, conceal, inject, ingest, inhale or otherwise introduce into the human body a controlled substance in violation of the Controlled Substances Act.

A person who violates the provisions of Subsection A of this section shall be issued a penalty assessment pursuant to Section 31-19A-1 NMSA 1978 and is subject to a fine of fifty dollars ($50.00). A person who violates the provisions of Subsection B of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nD. A person eighteen years of age or over who violates the provisions of Subsection B of this section by delivering drug paraphernalia to a person under eighteen years of age and who is at least three years the person's junior is guilty of a fourth degree felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 30-31-25.1, enacted by Laws 1981, ch. 31, § 2; 1997, ch. 256, § 7; 2001, ch. 189, § 1; 2019, ch. 217, § 2; 2022, ch. 4, § 4.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective May 18, 2022, provided that possession of certain harm reduction program supplies or devices is an exception to the prohibition of possession of drug paraphernalia; and in Subsection A, added new paragraph designation \"(1)\", and added new Paragraphs A(2) and A(3).\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective July 1, 2019, decreased penalties for possession of drug paraphernalia; in Subsection C, after the first occurrence of \"violates\", deleted \"this section with respect to\" and added \"the provisions of\", after \"Subsection A of this section\", added \"shall be issued a penalty assessment pursuant to Section 3 of this 2019 act and\", and after \"is\", deleted \"guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than one hundred dollars ($100) or by imprisonment for a definite term less than one year, or both\" and added \"subject to a fine of fifty dollars ($50.00)\".\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, in the section heading, deleted \"or delivery to a minor\" following \"manufacturer\" and inserted \"exceptions\"; in Subsection B, inserted the Paragraph (1) designation and added Paragraph B(2).\n\nThe 1997 amendment, effective June 20, 1997, added the second sentences in Subsections A and B and, in Subsection C, deleted former paragraph designations at the beginning of the sentences and added \"Any person who violates this section with respect to\" at the beginning of the second sentence.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— The legislature did not intend to punish a defendant for possession of a controlled substance and possession of paraphernalia when the paraphernalia consists of only a container that is storing a personal supply of the charged controlled substance and where the defendant was convicted of possession of methamphetamine and possession of drug paraphernalia based on the possession of a baggie that held the methamphetamine, the defendant's conviction of possession of drug paraphernalia violated double jeopardy.State v. Almeida, 2008-NMCA-068, 144 N.M. 235, 185 P.3d 1085.\n\nSeparate convictions for possession of drug paraphernalia violated double jeopardy.— Where defendant was convicted of two counts of possession of drug paraphernalia, one based on his possession of over ninety small, plastic baggies and the second based on his possession of a red straw with a burnt end, both of which are commonly used to package methamphetamine, defendant's constitutional right to be free from double jeopardy was violated, because the evidence was seized from the same location and was intended for the same purpose, the packaging of methamphetamine, and there was no intervening act or any other factor that would distinguish defendant's act of possessing separate containers for holding the methamphetamine that was also found in defendant's possession.State v. Tidey, 2018-NMCA-014, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where police officers testified that they found a glass pipe containing a white substance in the center console of the vehicle defendant was driving and subsequent forensic testing revealed that the substance was methamphetamine, the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant possessed or constructively possessed the methamphetamine and the pipe and to permit the jury to infer that defendant knew that the substance was methamphetamine and that defendant intended to use the pipe to inhale methamphetamine.State v. Lopez, 2009-NMCA-127, 147 N.M. 364, 223 P.3d 361, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-010, 147 N.M. 452, 224 P.3d 1257.\n\nSufficient evidence of possession of drug paraphernalia.— Sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia where a reasonable jury could infer that defendant had knowledge of and control over drug paraphernalia based on evidence that a glass pipe similar to those used to ingest methamphetamine was found in defendant's vehicle and methamphetamine was found on defendant's person.State v. Howl, 2016-NMCA-084, cert. denied.\n\nTrafficking methamphetamine by manufacture and possession of drug paraphernalia.— Where the defendant was convicted of trafficking methamphetamine by manufacture for possession of items that could be used to manufacture methamphetamine and possession of drug paraphernalia for possession of items that could be used to consume methamphetamine and marijuana and where the items used to consume drugs were not necessary to manufacture methamphetamine, the defendant's conduct was not unitary and the defendant's convictions did not violate double jeopardy.State v. Vance, 2009-NMCA-024, 145 N.M. 706, 204 P.3d 31, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-001, 145 N.M. 655, 203 P.3d 870.\n\nVehicle search without consent allowed.— Where police officer could have arrested defendant for possession of drug paraphernalia, the officer, therefore, is allowed to search defendant's vehicle without consent.

If any person who has not previously been convicted of violating the laws of any state or any laws of the United States relating to narcotic drugs, marijuana, hallucinogenic or depressant or stimulant substances, is found guilty of a violation of Section 23 [30-31-23 NMSA 1978], after trial or upon a plea of guilty, the court may, without entering a judgment of guilty and with the consent of the person, defer further proceedings and place him on probation upon reasonable conditions and for a period, not to exceed one year, as the court may prescribe.\n\nB. Upon violation of a condition of the probation, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. The court may, in its discretion, dismiss the proceedings against the person and discharge him from probation before the expiration of the maximum period prescribed from the person's probation.\n\nC. If during the period of his probation the person does not violate any of the conditions of the probation, then upon expiration of the period the court shall discharge such person and dismiss the proceedings against him. Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without court adjudication of guilt, but a nonpublic record shall be retained by the attorney general solely for the purpose of use by the courts in determining whether or not, in subsequent proceedings, the person qualifies under this section. A discharge or dismissal shall not be deemed a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime including the penalties prescribed under this section for second or subsequent convictions or for any other purpose. Discharge and dismissal under this section may occur only once with respect to any person.\n\nD. Upon the dismissal of a person and discharge of the proceedings against him under this section, a person, if he was not over eighteen years of age at the time of the offense, may apply to the court for an order to expunge from all official records all recordation relating to his arrest, indictment or information, trial, finding or plea of guilty, and dismissal and discharge pursuant to this section except nonpublic records filed with the attorney general. If the court determines, after hearing, that the person was dismissed and the proceedings against him discharged and that he was not over eighteen years of age at the time of the offense, it shall enter the order. The effect of the order shall be to restore the person, in the contemplation of the law, to the status he occupied before the arrest or indictment or information. No person in whose behalf an order has been entered shall be held thereafter under any provision of any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his failures to recite or acknowledge such arrest, or indictment or information, or trial in response to any inquiry made of him for any purpose.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 54-11-28, enacted by Laws 1972, ch. 84, § 28.\n\nConditional discharge dismissal not \"conviction\".— A dismissal under the conditional discharge statute, Section 30-31-28 NMSA 1978, is not a \"conviction\" as contemplated by this section, or for any other purpose.State v. Fairbanks, 2004-NMCA-005, 134 N.M. 783, 82 P.3d 954.\n\nHabitual offender statute.— Although the habitual offender statute applies to a prior felony conviction under the Controlled Substances Act, Sections 30-31-1 to 30-31-41 NMSA 1978, it does not apply if there is a conditional discharge under Section 30-31-28 NMSA 1978.State v.

An exception to this rule occurs when theresis released accidentally, fraudulently or improperly.In re Forfeiture of One 1980 Honda Accord, 1988-NMCA-114, 108 N.M. 274, 771 P.2d 982 (decided under prior law,see nowSection 31-27-1 NMSA 1978).\n\nCounty, by executing on a district court's judgment of forfeiture of an automobile and transferring the title of the vehicle, removed theresfrom the court's control and ended the court's constructive possession of the vehicle.In re Forfeiture of One 1980 Honda Accord, 1988-NMCA-114, 108 N.M. 274, 771 P.2d 982 (decided under prior law,see nowSection 31-27-1 NMSA 1978).\n\nWhen a state entity initiates a forfeiture proceeding, thereby invoking the jurisdiction of the courts of New Mexico, those courts retainin personamjurisdiction until all appeals have been exhausted.Mitchell v.

Providing a hearing within 30 days satisfies the due process requirement.Weiler v. Carpenter, 695 F.2d 1348 (10th Cir. 1982) (decided under prior law,see nowSection 31-27-1 NMSA 1978).\n\nJeopardy can attachin a civil forfeiture proceeding arising under the Controlled Substances Act when the final disposition of the case results in a stipulated dismissal and a loss of a property interest without a judgment of forfeiture.State v.

Nunez, 2000-NMSC-013, 129 N.M. 63, 2 P.3d 264 (decided under prior law,see nowSection 31-27-1 NMSA 1978).\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Where the city's forfeiture complaint was filed on June 4, 2001, the stipulated order of dismissal releasing the vehicle to the credit company was entered on August 21, 2001, and the criminal charges against both defendants were not filed until October 1, 2001, there was never a single bifurcated proceeding and if the city and state had combined these cases in a single bifurcated proceeding, there would be no double jeopardy issue.State v.
