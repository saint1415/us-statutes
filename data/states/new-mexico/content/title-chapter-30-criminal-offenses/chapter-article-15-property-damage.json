      "text": "Criminal damage to property consists of intentionally damaging any real or personal property of another without the consent of the owner of the property.\n\nWhoever commits criminal damage to property is guilty of a petty misdemeanor, except that when the damage to the property amounts to more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) he is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-15-1, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 15-1.\n\nCross references.— For destruction of newspapers kept by county clerk,see4-40-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor authority of conservation officers to enforce these provisions under emergency circumstances,see17-2-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor polluting of water,see30-8-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor destruction of cemetery property,see30-12-13 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor criminal trespass,see30-14-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor liability of parents for destruction of property by child,see32A-2-27 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor flooding of highway,see67-7-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor interference with or changing of water measuring devices,see72-5-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor injury and interference with waterworks,see72-8-1 and 72-8-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor interference with community ditches,see73-2-64 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor injuring of survey marks,see73-17-5 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor injuring of fence,see77-16-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe replacement cost of irreparable items is an appropriate measure of the value of the items.State v. Cobrera2013-NMSC-012, 300 P.3d 729.\n\nThe purchase price of an item was sufficient evidence of replacement cost.— Where defendant damaged household goods of defendant's estranged spouse; and the state's evidence showed that the purchase price of the irreparably damaged items was greater than $1,000, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that the replacement cost of the items was greater than $1,000.State v. Cobrera2013-NMSC-012, 300 P.3d 729.\n\nDetermining damage amount for felony criminal damage to property.— The damage amount for felony criminal damage to property is the cost of repair or replacement cost, whichever is less. The state bears the burden of proving the replacement cost of the damaged property.State v. Fernandez, 2015-NMCA-091.\n\nWhere defendant kicked victim's twelve-year-old pickup truck, causing a large dent in the door of victim's vehicle and then struck victim's truck with defendant's own vehicle, and the state presented evidence at trial that the cost of repair of victim's truck was between $1,500 and $1,600, but failed to offer evidence regarding replacement cost, there was insufficient evidence to convict defendant of felony criminal damage to property, because the state was required to submit evidence as to replacement cost so that the jury could reasonably determine whether it exceeded the cost of repair.State v. Fernandez, 2015-NMCA-091.\n\nCriminal damage to property was a lesser included offense of breaking and entering.— Where defendant attempted to force entry into an apartment through the front door; the occupants of the apartment struggled to hold the door closed; defendant pushed the occupants back into the apartment about a foot and stepped into the apartment; while one occupant of the apartment attempted to call 911, defendant walked away; and when the other occupant opened the door to see which way defendant had gone, defendant returned and began kicking the door, defendant's initial act of trying to force open the door of the apartment and then returning minutes later to kick the door was unitary conduct and defendant's conviction of criminal damage to property, which was a lesser included offense of defendant's conviction of breaking and entering, violated defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy.State v. Sorrelhorse, 2011-NMCA-095, 150 N.M. 536, 263 P.3d 313, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-008, 268 P.3d 513.\n\nCost of repair.— The cost of repair alone is sufficient to support a conviction for criminal damage to property.State v. Barreras, 2007-NMCA-067, 141 N.M. 653, 159 P.3d 1138.\n\nInsufficient evidence to establish damage was over $1,000.— Where defendant was charged with criminal damage to property over $1000, and where, at trial, the state presented evidence that after defendant was arrested and placed in the back of the officer's patrol car, defendant became erratic and kicked and cracked the plexiglass divider and that the estimated cost of repair was $1,710, which included a drive time and mileage charge for the transport of the patrol car from Carlsbad to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and back, the state erred in including the cost of the technician's travel to Carlsbad from Albuquerque to work on the police car, because nothing in the language of the statute or the uniform jury instruction, UJI 14-1510 NMRA, states that additional charges or costs can be included in the \"repair or replacement cost\" of the item damaged. Thus, there was insufficient evidence at trial for a jury to convict defendant of criminal damage to property over $1,000.State v. Fierro, 2024-NMCA-016.\n\nLesser included offenses.— Entrustment and conversion are not elements of criminal damage to property.State v. Archie, 1997-NMCA-058, 123 N.M. 503, 943 P.2d 537.\n\nDefendant charged under this section and vehicle tampering statute.— Where defendant caused damage in excess of $1000 to a vehicle, the general/specific rule did not apply to prevent a charge of criminal damage to property under this section, on the basis that defendant could only be charged under Section 66-3-506 NMSA 1978 (now Section 30-16D-5 NMSA 1978), prohibiting injuring or tampering with a vehicle.State v. Arellano, 1997-NMCA-074, 123 N.M. 589, 943 P.2d 1042, cert. quashed, 124 N.M. 589, 953 P.2d 1087 (1998).\n\nCommunity property of defendant.— This section does not criminalize damage to community property one owns; such property is not \"property of another\" for purposes of this section.State v. Powels, 2003-NMCA-090, 134 N.M. 118, 73 P.3d 256.\n\nEquitable owner of property.— The equitable owner of property under a real estate contract cannot be criminally charged with damaging that property.State v. Earp, 2014-NMCA-059.\n\nWhere defendant purchased a home pursuant to a real estate contract; when defendant failed to pay the balance due on the contract, the seller terminated the contract; prior to vacating the property, defendant removed a number of appliances and fixtures from the house and left the house in a state of disrepair; and defendant was charged with criminal damage to property, 30-15-1 NMSA 1978 did not apply to property in which defendant had an equitable ownership interest.State v. Earp, 2014-NMCA-059.\n\nDefense of habitation.— Question whether force used by a person in defense of habitation exceeded what was reasonably necessary was for the jury to resolve upon appropriate instructions by the trial judge.State v. Couch, 1946-NMSC-047, 52 N.M. 127, 193 P.2d 405.\n\nThe defense of habitation alone, without a statute making it a felony to unlawfully and maliciously injure a house, gave householder the right to meet force with force, and \"an attack upon a dwelling, and especially in the night, the law regards as equivalent to an assault on a man's person, for a man's house is his castle.\"State v. Couch, 1946-NMSC-047, 52 N.M. 127, 193 P.2d 405.\n\nWhen one's home was attacked in the middle of a dark night by persons riding in an automobile, the householder, being unable to determine what weapons the assailants had, was not obliged to retreat but might pursue his adversaries until he found himself out of danger.State v. Couch, 1946-NMSC-047, 52 N.M. 127, 193 P.2d 405.\n\nResistance to commission of felony.— While no law countenanced wanton slaying, the protection and security of life being the most vital interest of society, the law of defense of habitation and the resistance to the commission of a felony thereon gave householder right to kill aggressor, if such killing was necessary or apparently necessary to prevent or repel the felonious aggression.State v. Couch, 1946-NMSC-047, 52 N.M. 127, 193 P.2d 405.\n\nTort liability for injury to trespasser.— As a matter of law the use of a gun by owner while stopping trespass or theft of watermelons by group of boys was not permissible, and when owner fired gun he became liable to injured boy.Brown v. Martinez, 1961-NMSC-040, 68 N.M. 271, 361 P.2d 152.\n\nSufficiency of evidence.— Evidence was sufficient to support an inference that damages were at least $1,000.State v. Haar, 1990-NMCA-076, 110 N.M. 517, 797 P.2d 306, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 330, 795 P.2d 1022.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where the evidence showed that defendant bashed out the windows of a truck with a baseball bat, threw rocks at the truck and through the windows of the truck, kicked the truck, tore the face plate off of the stereo in the truck in an attempt to take the stereo, which damaged the entire stereo system, destroyed the rearview mirror in truck, and irreparably damaged the ignition column of the truck, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of criminal damage to property.State v. Dickert, 2012-NMCA-004, 268 P.3d 515, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-012.\n\nInsufficient evidence of intent to damage the property of another.— Where defendant was convicted of criminal damage to property based on DNA evidence found in a burglarized house, there was insufficient evidence to permit a rational jury to find the essential facts to establish each element of the crime of criminal damage to property beyond a reasonable doubt, because although there was evidence that defendant had entered the property without authorization, the state, without presenting any evidence linking defendant to the property damage, failed to establish, either directly or by circumstantial evidence, that defendant intentionally damaged the property of another.State v. Ledbetter, 2020-NMCA-046.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 52 Am.
