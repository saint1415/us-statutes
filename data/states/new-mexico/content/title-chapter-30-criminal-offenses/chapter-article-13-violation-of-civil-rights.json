      "heading": "Disturbing lawful assembly.Section 30-13-2 - Denial of service by a utility",
      "text": "Disturbing lawful assembly consists of:\n\nA. disturbing any religious society or any member thereof when assembled or collected together in public worship; or\n\nB. disturbing any meeting of the people assembled for any legal object.\n\nWhoever commits disturbing lawful assembly is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-13-1, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 13-1.\n\nDue process.— The language of Subsection B of this section conveys a sufficiently definite warning of the conduct proscribed and is therefore not void for vagueness.State v. Orzen, 1972-NMCA-006, 83 N.M. 458, 493 P.2d 768.\n\nIntent of legislature.— Contention that legislature did not intend this section to apply to conduct formerly covered by 40-12-7, 1953 Comp., was incorrect.State v. Orzen, 1972-NMCA-006, 83 N.M. 458, 493 P.2d 768.\n\nMeaning of \"disturbing\".— Since the statutory word \"disturbing\" is not defined, its ordinary meaning was properly applied by the trial court in instruction that term \"disturb\" meant \"to throw into disorder or confusion, to interrupt.\"State v. Orzen, 1972-NMCA-006, 83 N.M. 458, 493 P.2d 768.\n\nMeaning of \"meeting\".— Subsection B of this section forbids the disturbance of any meeting of the people assembled for any legal object, that is, any gathering for business, social or other purposes if the object of the gathering is legal.State v. Orzen, 1972-NMCA-006, 83 N.M. 458, 493 P.2d 768.\n\nBasketball game spectators as \"meeting\".— The people assembled to view a basketball game constituted a \"meeting\" within meaning of this section.State v. Orzen, 1972-NMCA-006, 83 N.M. 458, 493 P.2d 768.\n\nBasketball game players as \"meeting\".— Players in basketball game were a meeting of people assembled for a lawful object.State v. Orzen, 1972-NMCA-006, 83 N.M. 458, 493 P.2d 768.\n\nEvidence sufficient.— Evidence that basketball game was delayed 35 to 40 minutes by necessity of removing debris and liquids from playing surface was substantial evidence that meeting of the players and meeting of the spectators to view the game were interrupted.State v. Orzen, 1972-NMCA-006, 83 N.M. 458, 493 P.2d 768.\n\nEvidence that the defendants threw objects when others also threw them, and also evidence from which community of intent could be reasonably inferred, was sufficient for the issue of aiding and abetting those who threw far enough so that objects landed on the playing surface of the courts to be submitted to the jury.State v. Orzen, 1972-NMCA-006, 83 N.M. 458, 493 P.2d 768.\n\nAiding and abetting.— Although charged with disturbing meeting under this section, defendants could be convicted of aiding and abetting that disturbance.State v. Orzen, 1972-NMCA-006, 83 N.M. 458, 493 P.2d 768.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 24 Am. Jur. 2d Disturbing Meetings §§ 1 to 11.\n\nConduct amounting to offense of disturbing religious meeting, 12 A.L.R. 650.\n\nProhibition or limitation on display of signs by employees as unfair labor practices, 86 A.L.R.

      "heading": "Denial of service by a utility.",
      "text": "Denial of service by a utility consists of any utility refusing to furnish service to another in the area served by such utility. Utility as used in this section is defined as any person furnishing to the public: water, power, telephone or gas. Provided such utility may lawfully refuse its services if:\n\nA. the person to be served has not tendered an amount of money required for the expense of construction, if construction is necessary for furnishing the utilities; or\n\nB. the person has not tendered the amount of money due for the use of such utilities.\n\nWhoever commits denial of services [service] by a utility is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-13-2, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 13-2.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nDisputed claim.— A public service corporation could not cut off a supply of water or electricity to enforce payment of a disputed claim.Miller v. Roswell Gas & Elec. Co., 1917-NMSC-034, 22 N.M. 594, 166 P. 1177 (decided under prior law).\n\nSection assumes that customer has right to demand service.— If a customer's installation has not passed or would not pass electrical inspection, he has no right to demand service of utility. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-81.\n\nDuty to refuse service.— A utility has a positive duty to refuse service to a customer whose wiring is known by the utility to be in a dangerous or defective condition. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-81.\n\nDefense to prosecution.— Compliance with rules of the public service commission permitting a public utility to discontinue service immediately in the event of a condition determined by the utility to be hazardous would be a defense to a criminal action upon a refusal to render electric service, but the burden would be upon the utility to produce some evidence that the condition was actually hazardous and to prove the existence of the rule itself. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-81.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 74 Am. Jur. 2d Telecommunications §§ 61, 62; 78 Am.
