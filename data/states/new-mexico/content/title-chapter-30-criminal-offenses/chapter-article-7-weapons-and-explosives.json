Salazar, 1997-NMCA-043, 123 N.M. 347, 940 P.2d 195.\n\nLoaded revolverwas a deadly weapon.Territory v.

Conwell, 1932-NMSC-042, 36 N.M. 253, 13 P.2d 554.\n\nReadily accessible.— Evidence that a loaded gun was located in the trunk of the defendant's car where he could easily get at it was sufficient to show that it was readily accessible, and the evidence was thus sufficient to establish that the weapon was carried onto school premises in violation of 30-7-2.1 NMSA 1978.State v.

      "text": "A. Unlawful carrying of a deadly weapon consists of carrying a concealed loaded firearm or any other type of deadly weapon anywhere, except in the following cases:\n\n(1) in the person's residence or on real property belonging to him as owner, lessee, tenant or licensee;\n\n(2) in a private automobile or other private means of conveyance, for lawful protection of the person's or another's person or property;\n\n(3) by a peace officer in accordance with the policies of his law enforcement agency who is certified pursuant to the Law Enforcement Training Act [Chapter 29, Article 7 NMSA 1978];\n\n(4) by a peace officer in accordance with the policies of his law enforcement agency who is employed on a temporary basis by that agency and who has successfully completed a course of firearms instruction prescribed by the New Mexico law enforcement academy or provided by a certified firearms instructor who is employed on a permanent basis by a law enforcement agency; or\n\n(5) by a person in possession of a valid concealed handgun license issued to him by the department of public safety pursuant to the provisions of the Concealed Handgun Carry Act [Chapter 29, Article 19 NMSA 1978].\n\nB. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the carrying of any unloaded firearm.\n\nC. Whoever commits unlawful carrying of a deadly weapon is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-7-2, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 7-2; 1975, ch. 134, § 1; 1985, ch. 174, § 1; 2001, ch. 219, § 13.\n\nCross references.— For right of people to bear nonconcealed arms,seeN.M. Const., art. II, § 6.\n\nFor the department of public safety,see9-19-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor right of sheriffs to carry concealed arms,see4-41-10, 4-41-10.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor sentencing for misdemeanors,see31-19-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, inserted Paragraph A(5).\n\nThe 1985 amendmentsubstituted \"in accordance with the policies of his law enforcement agency who is certified pursuant to the Law Enforcement Training Act; or\" for \"in the lawful discharge of his duties\" in Subsection A(3) and added Subsection A(4).\n\nPocketknife.— An ordinary pocketknife is not a per se deadly weapon, without regard to its actual or intended use.State v. Nick R., 2009-NMSC-050, 147 N.M. 182, 218 P.3d 868.\n\nIntended use of weapon.— Where the child worked in the child's father's furniture store; the father supplied all employees with pocketknives for opening boxes at work; one day at school, the child felt something in the child's pocket and pulled it out to look at it; and the object was a pocketknife the child had been using at work the day before when the child had been wearing the same pair of pants, the child was entitled to a jury determination of whether the child intended to carry the pocketknife as a deadly weapon.State v. Nick R., 2009-NMSC-050, 147 N.M. 182, 218 P.3d 868.\n\nConstitutionality.— This section does not violate equal protection on the basis that it impermissibly distinguishes between rich and poor, in that homeowners and vehicle owners may properly conceal weapons whereas poor people do not own a residence or vehicle in which to conceal a weapon.State v. McDuffie, 1987-NMCA-077, 106 N.M. 120, 739 P.2d 989.\n\nLegislative intent of Subsection A(2)— The legislature, in enacting Subsection A(2) of this section, was aware of the inherent characteristics of firearms, but nevertheless concluded that lawfully carried firearms do not present an unreasonable risk of harm to persons in the vicinity of the firearm.State v. Garcia, 2004-NMCA-066, 135 N.M. 595, 92 P.3d 41, cert. granted, 135 N.M. 566, 92 P.3d 12,rev'd on other grounds, 2005-NMSC-017, 138 N.M. 1, 116 P.3d 72.\n\nWhen object \"deadly weapon\".— Under this section, any object, even if manufactured for an innocent, nonviolent purpose, may be a deadly weapon, if it has a potential violent use and if, under the surrounding circumstances, the purpose of carrying the object was for use as a weapon.State v. Blea, 1983-NMCA-089, 100 N.M. 237, 668 P.2d 1114.\n\nPeace officers.— None of the officers named in Laws 1891, ch. 63, § 3 (former 40-17-9, 1953 Comp.), providing when peace officers might carry weapons, had any more right to carry weapons than a private citizen, except when the same was done in the proper and necessary discharge of official duties.Guyse v. Territory, 1893-NMSC-022, 7 N.M. 228, 34 P. 295 (decided under prior law).\n\nCarrying arms while traveling.— The word \"travelers\" in Laws 1887, ch. 30, § 9 (former 40-17-8, 1953 Comp.), providing that arms might be carried while traveling, did not include a ranch owner who made daily trips of less than ten miles to his ranch; nor could it have included one who had reached his objective before the homicide.State v. Sedillo, 1918-NMSC-105, 24 N.M. 549, 174 P. 985 (decided under prior law).\n\nFugitive from justice was not a \"person traveling\" under Laws 1887, ch. 30, § 9 (former 40-17-8, 1953 Comp.), and was therefore not permitted to carry arms.State v. Starr, 1917-NMSC-092, 24 N.M. 180, 173 P. 674, writ of error dismissed, 254 U.S. 611, 41 S. Ct. 61, 65 L. Ed. 437 (1920) (decided under prior law).\n\nStatute inapplicable to murder case.— Statute pertaining to carrying weapon upon one's \"landed estate\" had no bearing in a murder case where accused pleaded self-defense, and testimony thereunder was properly excluded.State v. Martinez, 1929-NMSC-040, 34 N.M. 112, 278 P. 210.\n\nException added by Concealed Handgun Act.— Under this section, the Concealed Handgun Carry Act does no more than add another exception to the general prohibition against carrying concealed weapons: carrying with a concealed handgun license.State ex rel. New Mexico Voices for Children, Inc. v. Denko, 2004-NMSC-011, 135 N.M. 439, 90 P.3d 458.\n\nInstruction properly refused in burglary case.— Offense of unlawfully carrying a deadly weapon is neither a degree of burglary, nor the higher degree of aggravated burglary, and the trial court did not err in refusing to submit to the jury the offense of unlawfully carrying a deadly weapon as a lesser included offense.State v. Andrada, 1971-NMCA-033, 82 N.M. 543, 484 P.2d 763, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 534, 484 P.2d 754, and denial of post-conviction relief affirmed, 1971-NMCA-184, 83 N.M. 393, 492 P.2d 1010.\n\nEvidence of crime.— Evidence tending to establish that defendant was armed with a loaded .38 caliber pistol concealed on his person was evidence tending to establish crime hereunder.State v. Andrada, 1971-NMCA-033, 82 N.M. 543, 484 P.2d 763, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 534, 484 P.2d 754, and denial of post-conviction relief affirmed, 1971-NMCA-184, 83 N.M. 393, 492 P.2d 1010.\n\nProbable cause to arrest.— Sight of pistol in defendant's pocket gave arresting officer all the probable cause needed to make an arrest, regardless of whether the weapon later was found to be unloaded.Ramirez v. Rodriguez, 467 F.2d 822 (10th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 987, 93 S. Ct. 1518, 36 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1973).\n\nThere was probable cause to arrest the defendant for carrying a concealed weapon, where his belligerent behavior had led to a police officer's request to step out of his car and the officer was justified in performing a patdown search after seeing another weapon fall out of the vehicle when defendant opened the door.United States v. Henning, 906 F.2d 1392 (10th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1069, 111 S. Ct. 789, 112 L. Ed. 2d 852 (1991).\n\nReasonable grounds of belief.— Where officer was told that man who assaulted deceased had gone into building where he subsequently found defendant wearing a coat which appeared to have bloodstains on the right sleeve, and he saw butt of a pistol protruding from defendant's pants pocket which had been concealed until the coat was opened, under the circumstances the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that defendant was unlawfully carrying a deadly weapon.State v. Ramirez, 1968-NMSC-148, 79 N.M. 475, 444 P.2d 986.\n\nTort liability of parents.— Absent knowledge on part of parent that child of 13 years was indiscreet or reckless in handling of firearms, mere keeping of a loaded gun on premises, and leaving the child there alone, did not make the parent liable for torts committed by the minor.Lopez v. Chewiwie, 1947-NMSC-061, 51 N.M. 421, 186 P.2d 512.\n\nNo duty on \"Saturday night special\" manufacturers not to sell.— In the area of firearm manufacture and sale, the New Mexico legislature, while imposing certain restrictions, has not seen fit to make such distribution per se unlawful and in the absence of any legislative action, or specific guidance from the New Mexico courts, the court held, in a case involving a \"Saturday night special\" used to kill plaintiff's husband, that it would not impose a \"duty\" upon manufacturers of firearms not to sell their products, merely because such products have the potential to be misused for purposes of criminal activity.Armijo v. Ex Cam, Inc., 656 F. Supp. 771 (D.N.M. 1987), aff'd, 843 F.2d 406 (10th Cir. 1988).\n\nDemonstration of switchblade to jury held proper.— Where a defendant was charged with unlawful possession of a switchblade, the trial court did not err in permitting a demonstration of how the knife worked. The issue for the jury in this case was how the knife could be opened. Therefore, the officer's demonstration was properly allowed over the objection made at trial.State v. Riddall, 1991-NMCA-033, 112 N.M. 78, 811 P.2d 576, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 21, 810 P.2d 1241.\n\nSufficiency of evidence.— Where a defendant was charged with carrying a concealed deadly weapon, the prosecution was not required to prove that the knife could actually be used to inflict great bodily harm; the prosecution needed to prove only that a butterfly knife was a switchblade. There was sufficient evidence that the knife carried by defendant was a switchblade as defined in 30-7-8 NMSA 1978.State v. Riddall, 1991-NMCA-033, 112 N.M. 78, 811 P.2d 576, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 21, 810 P.2d 1241.\n\nApplicability to school security force.— Members of a security and patrol force composed of regular full-time employees of the Albuquerque public school system to guard school buildings and property could not be properly described as peace officers and must operate in compliance with the state statutes restricting possession and use of deadly weapons. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-87 (unofficial opinion issued to superintendent of Albuquerque public schools).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Right (?) to Keep and Bear Arms,\" see 27 N.M.L.

Unlawful carrying of a firearm in an establishment licensed to dispense alcoholic beverages consists of carrying a loaded or unloaded firearm on any premises licensed by the regulation and licensing department for the dispensing of alcoholic beverages except:\n\n(1) by a law enforcement officer in the lawful discharge of the officer's duties;\n\n(2) by a law enforcement officer who is certified pursuant to the Law Enforcement Training Act [Chapter 29, Article 7 NMSA 1978] acting in accordance with the policies of the officer's law enforcement agency;\n\n(3) by the owner, lessee, tenant or operator of the licensed premises or the owner's, lessee's, tenant's or operator's agents, including privately employed security personnel during the performance of their duties;\n\n(4) by a person carrying a concealed handgun who is in possession of a valid concealed handgun license for that gun pursuant to the Concealed Handgun Carry Act [Chapter 29, Article 19 NMSA 1978] on the premises of:\n\n(a) a licensed establishment that does not sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises; or\n\n(b) a restaurant licensed to sell only beer and wine that derives no less than sixty percent of its annual gross receipts from the sale of food for consumption on the premises, unless the restaurant has a sign posted, in a conspicuous location at each public entrance, prohibiting the carrying of firearms, or the person is verbally instructed by the owner or manager that the carrying of a firearm is not permitted in the restaurant;\n\n(5) by a person in that area of the licensed premises usually and primarily rented on a daily or short-term basis for sleeping or residential occupancy, including hotel or motel rooms;\n\n(6) by a person on that area of a licensed premises primarily used for vehicular traffic or parking; or\n\n(7) for the purpose of temporary display, provided that the firearm is:\n\n(a) made completely inoperative before it is carried onto the licensed premises and remains inoperative while it is on the licensed premises; and\n\n(b) under the control of the licensee or an agent of the licensee while the firearm is on the licensed premises.\n\nB. Whoever commits unlawful carrying of a firearm in an establishment licensed to dispense alcoholic beverages is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-7-2.1, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 149, § 1; 1977, ch. 160, § 1; 1999, ch. 156, § 1; 2007, ch. 158, § 1; 2010, ch. 106, § 1.\n\nThe 2010 amendment,effective July 1, 2010, in Subsection A(4), after \"Concealed Handgun Carry Act\", deleted \"provided that the\" and added \"on the premises of;\"; and added Subparagraph (b) of Paragraph (4) of Subsection A.\n\nThe 2007 amendment, effective July 1, 2007, added Paragraphs (2) and (4) of Subsection A.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, substituted \"regulation and licensing department\" for \"department of alcoholic beverage control\" in the introductory paragraph of Subsection A and added Subsection A(5).\n\nPurpose of statute is to protect innocent patronsof businesses held out to the public as licensed liquor establishments.State v. Soto, 1980-NMSC-114, 95 N.M. 81, 619 P.2d 185.\n\nPurpose of statute.— The purpose of the section is to protect innocent patrons of businesses which are licensed liquor establishments, and application during periods when liquor sales are prohibited by statute still serves the purpose of preventing or warding off the potential for harm from the mixture of alcohol and firearms.State v. Lake, 1996-NMCA-055, 121 N.M. 794, 918 P.2d 380, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 676, 916 P.2d 1343.\n\nState's prima facie case requires proof of licensing,and is satisfied by the testimony of the owner of the bar and by a copy of the license.State v. Soto, 1980-NMSC-114, 95 N.M. 81, 619 P.2d 185.\n\nThis section is constitutional,as being within the police powers of the legislature, and is a valid regulation of a constitutional privilege.State v. Dees, 1983-NMCA-105, 100 N.M. 252, 669 P.2d 261.\n\nConstitutionality.— This section is not overbroad or vague; it does not require proof that the defendant knew his act to be unlawful. Further the definition of licensed premises includes areas of the licensed premises besides those where the alcoholic beverages are displayed, and in the case at bar, the defendant knew his conduct violated the statute since the defendant had been repeatedly warned by store employees that bringing a firearm into the store was illegal.State v. Lake, 1996-NMCA-055, 121 N.M. 794, 918 P.2d 380, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 676, 916 P.2d 1343.\n\nSection applicable to any premises licensed for dispensing.— This section does not refer to a particular type of license; it applies to any premises licensed for dispensing; it is not limited to a dispenser's license and it is to be read with 60-3-1 NMSA 1978 (now 60-3A-3 NMSA 1978).State v. Montoya, 1977-NMCA-134, 91 N.M. 262, 572 P.2d 1270.\n\nState of mind necessary for commission of the crime.— The requisite mens rea element of this crime is that the possession be intentional; in other words, that the offender have actual knowledge of the possession. The jury needs only to find that the defendant acted intentionally and that he or she purposely did an act which the law declared to be a crime, whether or not the defendant knew the act to be unlawful.State v. Powell, 1993-NMCA-021, 115 N.M. 188, 848 P.2d 1115.\n\nGeneral criminal intent.— This section requires general criminal intent as to carrying of the firearm, but not as to the premises upon which the firearm is carried.State v. Torres, 2003-NMCA-101, 134 N.M. 194, 75 P.3d 410, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 179, 74 P.3d 1071.\n\nEvidence sufficient for conviction.— To sustain the charge of unlawful carrying of a firearm in a licensed liquor establishment, the state was required to prove that defendant carried a loaded or unloaded firearm in an establishment licensed to dispense alcoholic beverages. Testimony that lounge displayed a license supports an inference that the license had not expired. Testimony that defendant carried a bag into the lounge which was later found to contain a handgun supports a reasonable inference is that it was the same one defendant carried in the lounge.State v. Rivera, 1993-NMCA-011, 115 N.M. 424, 853 P.2d 126, cert. denied, 115. N.M. 228, 849 P.2d 371.\n\nMistake-of-fact defense.— Because of the strict liability nature of the offense of unlawfully carrying a firearm into a licensed liquor establishment, the defendant was not entitled to raise a mistake-of-fact defense regarding the nature of the establishment.State v. Torres, 2003-NMCA-101, 134 N.M. 194, 75 P.3d 410, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 179, 74 P.3d 1071.\n\nInstructions.— The listing of the persons excepted in Subsection A does not constitute an essential element of the offense and the failure to instruct on these exceptions is not jurisdictional and reversible error, especially when the defendant has not cited proof nor stated any facts to show that the exceptions apply to him.State v. Roybal, 1983-NMCA-085, 100 N.M. 155, 667 P.2d 462.\n\nSale of firearms.— The selling of firearms in a licensed liquor establishment would be unlawful pursuant to this section. 1977 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 77-23.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Right (?) to Keep and Bear Arms,\" see 27 N.M.L. Rev. 491 (1997).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 79 Am.

      "heading": "Negligent use of a deadly weapon.",
      "text": "A. Negligent use of a deadly weapon consists of:\n\n(1) discharging a firearm into any building or vehicle or so as to knowingly endanger a person or his property;\n\n(2) carrying a firearm while under the influence of an intoxicant or narcotic;\n\n(3) endangering the safety of another by handling or using a firearm or other deadly weapon in a negligent manner; or\n\n(4) discharging a firearm within one hundred fifty yards of a dwelling or building, not including abandoned or vacated buildings on public lands during hunting seasons, without the permission of the owner or lessees thereof.\n\nB. The provisions of Paragraphs (1), (3) and (4) of Subsection A of this section shall not apply to a peace officer or other public employee who is required or authorized by law to carry or use a firearm in the course of his employment and who carries, handles, uses or discharges a firearm while lawfully engaged in carrying out the duties of his office or employment.\n\nC. The exceptions from criminal liability provided for in Subsection B of this section shall not preclude or affect civil liability for the same conduct.\n\nWhoever commits negligent use of a deadly weapon is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-7-3, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 7-3; 1977, ch. 266, § 1; 1979, ch. 79, § 1; 1993, ch. 139, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For authority of conservation officers to enforce these provisions under emergency circumstances,see17-2-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, substituted \"a dwelling or building, not including abandoned or vacated buildings on public lands during hunting seasons\" for \"an inhabited dwelling or building\" in Subsection A(4) and inserted \"of this section\" in Subsection C.\n\nSubsection A(2) is not unconstitutionally vague.A person of ordinary intelligence would understand what conduct is prohibited by the statute: having a firearm nearby, readily capable of being put into action or service, while under the influence of alcohol. The statute plainly does not require that the intoxicated person actually use or intend to use the firearm.State v. Rivera, 1993-NMCA-011, 115 N.M. 424, 853 P.2d 126, cert. denied, 115. N.M. 228, 849 P.2d 371.\n\nConstitutionality.— Possession of firearms by intoxicated persons presents a clear danger to the public. The state constitution does not support a right to engage in this type of behavior. Therefore, the defendant's conviction for negligent use of a deadly weapon did not violate his right to bear arms under the state constitution, since there was evidence that he was intoxicated, he pointed the gun at another person, and he appeared to be loading the gun.State v. Rivera, 1993-NMCA-011, 115 N.M. 424, 853 P.2d 126, cert. denied, 115. N.M. 228, 849 P.2d 371.\n\n\"Negligent\" defined.— \"Negligent\" means omitting to do something which a reasonable man, guided by those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do.State v. Grubbs, 1973-NMCA-096, 85 N.M. 365, 512 P.2d 693,overruled,Santillanes v. State, 1993-NMSC-012, 115 N.M. 215, 849 P.2d 358;seeState v. Yarborough, 1995-NMCA-116, 120 N.M. 669, 905 P.2d 209.\n\nCriminal negligence is not negligence referred to in Subsection C(now Subsection A (3) of this section).State v. Grubbs, 1973-NMCA-096, 85 N.M. 365, 512 P.2d 693.\n\nEvidence of frame of mind.— Evidence of conduct at and subsequent to commission of crime of unlawfully discharging a firearm in a settlement was competent to show frame of mind of defendant.State v. Bustillos, 1932-NMSC-004, 36 N.M. 30, 7 P.2d 296.\n\nInstruction required in homicide case.— In homicide prosecution where one of defendant's theories was involuntary manslaughter, and record was replete with testimony that defendant was drunk while he rode around in automobile with deceased and witness holding and handling sawed-off shotgun, court's refusal to instruct the jury that negligent use of a weapon while under influence of an intoxicant was a petty misdemeanor left jury without a guide to determine whether this was a killing while in the commission of a misdemeanor, and was reversible error.State v. Durham, 1971-NMCA-168, 83 N.M. 350, 491 P.2d 1161.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 79 Am.

      "text": "A. A waiting period of seven calendar days shall be required for the sale of a firearm and the transfer of the firearm to the buyer. The seven-calendar-day waiting period shall include the period required to conduct a federal instant background check; provided that, if the seven-calendar-day waiting period has expired without the completion of a required federal instant background check, the seller shall not transfer the firearm to the buyer until the federal instant background check is completed. If the required federal instant background check has not been completed within twenty days, the seller may transfer the firearm to the buyer.\n\nB. The firearm shall remain in the custody of the seller or the federal firearms licensee performing the federal instant background check during the entirety of the waiting period.\n\nC. Unlawful sale of a firearm before the required waiting period ends consists of the transfer of ownership, possession or physical control of the firearm from the seller to the buyer before the end of the required seven-calendar-day waiting period, but does not include temporary possession or control of a firearm provided to a customer by the proprietor of a licensed business in the conduct of that business.\n\nD.

Each firearm sold contrary to the provisions of this section constitutes a separate offense under Subsection C of this section.\n\nF. Two or more offenses may be charged in the same complaint, information or indictment and shall be punished as separate offenses.\n\nG. Whoever violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nH.

      "heading": "Unlawful possession of switchblades.",
      "text": "Unlawful possession of switchblades consists of any person, either manufacturing, causing to be manufactured, possessing, displaying, offering, selling, lending, giving away or purchasing any knife which has a blade which opens automatically by hand pressure applied to a button, spring or other device in the handle of the knife, or any knife having a blade which opens or falls or is ejected into position by the force of gravity or by any outward or centrifugal thrust or movement.\n\nWhoever commits unlawful possession of switchblades is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-7-7, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 7-7.\n\nConstitutionality— The terms of this section have specific meanings and can be defined unambiguously. Giving those words their ordinary meanings results in a reasonable and practical construction. Therefore, the statute is not void for vagueness.State v. Riddall, 1991-NMCA-033, 112 N.M. 78, 811 P.2d 576, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 21, 810 P.2d 1241.\n\nConstitutionality under the right to bear arms.— The appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny in a right to bear arms challenge pursuant to N.M. Const., art. II, § 6, is intermediate scrutiny; to survive a challenge under intermediate scrutiny, the government must show that the statute is substantially related to an important government purpose.State v. Murillo, 2015-NMCA-046.\n\nThis section serves an important governmental purpose, to protect the public from the surprise use of a dangerous weapon utilized in large part for unlawful activity, and prohibiting the possession of switchblades is substantially related to this narrow, but important, purpose.State v. Murillo, 2015-NMCA-046.\n\nConstitutionality under substantive due process.— Substantive due process prevents the government from engaging in conduct that shocks the conscience or interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty; the appropriate level of scrutiny of a statute challenged under substantive due process grounds depends on the nature and importance of the individual interests asserted and the classifications created by the statute.State v. Murillo, 2015-NMCA-046.\n\nWhere defendant claimed that prohibiting the possession of switchblade knives violated his right to bear arms guaranteed under U.S. Const., amend. II, as applied to the states under the due process clause of U.S. Const., amend. XIV, the New Mexico court of appeals, applying intermediate scrutiny to this section, held that the statute is not repugnant to the right to bear arms under a federal standard and that defendant's federal substantive due process challenge fails.State v. Murillo, 2015-NMCA-046.\n\n\"Butterfly knife\" included within the term \"switchblade\".— In determining whether a \"butterfly knife\" constitutes a switchblade, it is of no legal significance that a combination of gravity and centrifugal force is required. The phrase \"any outward or centrifugal thrust or movement\" suggests a legislative intent to include knives that require a combination of forces to operate. In this case, the words used and the intended purpose of the provision in which the words are contained indicate that the legislature intended to include a \"butterfly knife\" within the term \"switchblade knife\".State v. Riddall, 1991-NMCA-033, 112 N.M. 78, 811 P.2d 576, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 21, 810 P.2d 1241.\n\nDemonstration of switchblade to jury held proper.— Where a defendant was charged with unlawful possession of a switchblade, the trial court did not err in permitting a demonstration of how the knife worked. The issue for the jury in this case was how the knife could be opened. Therefore, the officer's demonstration was properly allowed over the objection made at trial.State v. Riddall, 1991-NMCA-033, 112 N.M. 78, 811 P.2d 576, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 21, 810 P.2d 1241.\n\nSufficiency of evidence.— Where a defendant was charged with carrying a concealed deadly weapon, the prosecution was not required to prove that the knife could actually be used to inflict great bodily harm; the prosecution needed to prove only that a butterfly knife was a switchblade. Thus there was sufficient evidence that the knife carried by defendant was a switchblade as defined in 30-7-8 NMSA 1978.State v. Riddall, 1991-NMCA-033, 112 N.M. 78, 811 P.2d 576, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 21, 810 P.2d 1241.\n\nAm.

As used in this section:\n\n(1) except as provided in Paragraph (2) of this subsection, \"destructive device\" means:\n\n(a) any explosive, incendiary or poison gas: 1) bomb; 2) grenade; 3) rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces; 4) missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-fourth ounce; 5) mine; or 6) similar device;\n\n(b) any type of weapon by whatever name known that will, or that may be readily converted to, expel a projectile by the action of an explosive or other propellant, the barrel or barrels of which have a bore of more than one-half inch in diameter, except a shotgun or shotgun shell that is generally recognized as particularly suitable for sporting purposes; or\n\n(c) any combination of parts either designed or intended for use in converting any device into a destructive device as defined in this paragraph and from which a destructive device may be readily assembled;\n\n(2) the term \"destructive device\" does not include any device that is neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon or any device, although originally designed for use as a weapon, that is redesigned for use as a signaling, pyrotechnic, line throwing, safety or similar device;\n\n(3) \"felon\" means a person convicted of a felony offense by a court of the United States or of any state or political subdivision thereof and:\n\n(a) less than ten years have passed since the person completed serving a sentence or period of probation for the felony conviction, whichever is later;\n\n(b) the person has not been pardoned for the felony conviction by the proper authority; and\n\n(c) the person has not received a deferred sentence;\n\n(4) \"firearm\" means any weapon that will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosion or the frame or receiver of any such weapon; and\n\n(5) \"serious violent felon\" means a person convicted of an offense enumerated in Subparagraphs (a) through (n) of Paragraph (4) of Subsection L of Section 33-2-34 NMSA 1978; provided that:\n\n(a) less than ten years have passed since the person completed serving a sentence or a period of probation for the felony conviction, whichever is later;\n\n(b) the person has not been pardoned for the felony conviction by the proper authority; and\n\n(c) the person has not received a deferred sentence and completed the total term of deferment as provided in Section 31-20-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:Laws 1981, ch. 225, § 1; 1987, ch. 202, § 1; 2001, ch. 89, § 1; 2018, ch. 74, § 4; 2019, ch. 253, § 1; 2020, ch. 54, § 2; 2022, ch. 56, § 26.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective May 18, 2022, clarified the penalty for receipt, transportation or possession of a firearm or destructive device by a serious violent felon; in Subsection B, after \"third degree felony\", deleted \"and shall be sentenced in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Sentencing Act\"; added a new Subsection C and redesignated former Subsections C and D as Subsections D and E, respectively; and in Subsection E, added Paragraph E(5).\n\nThe 2020 amendment,effective July 1, 2020, provided that the penalty for a felon in possession of a firearm or destructive device is a third degree felony; and in Subsection B, after \"shall be guilty of a\", deleted \"fourth\" and added \"third\", and after \"Criminal Sentencing Act\", deleted \"provided that the violation of and the sentence imposed pursuant to this subsection shall be increased to a violation of and the sentence for a third degree felony if the person has previously been convicted of a capital felony or a serious violent offense provided in Paragraph (4) of Subsection L of Section 33-2-34 NMSA 1978\".\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective July 1, 2019, expanded the categories of persons who cannot receive, transport or possess a firearm, and revised the definition of \"firearm\" as used in this section; in the section heading, deleted \"a felon\" and added \"certain persons\"; in Subsection A, in the introductory clause, after \"unlawful for\", deleted \"a felon\" and added \"the following persons\", and added Paragraphs A(1) through A(3); in Subsection B, deleted \"Any person violating the provisions of this section\" and added \"A felon found in possession of a firearm\", and after \"provided in\", deleted \"Subparagraphs (a) through (n) of\"; added a new Subsection C and redesignated former Subsection C as Subsection D; and in Subsection D, Paragraph D(4), after \"such weapon\", deleted \"or any firearm muffler or firearm silencer. 'Firearm' includes any handgun, rifle or shotgun\".\n\nThe 2018 amendment,effective July 1, 2018, increased the penalty for a felon in possession of a firearm or destructive device if the person has previously been convicted of a capital felony or a serious violent offense, and provided clarifying language; in Subsection B, after \"Criminal Sentencing Act\", added the remainder of the subsection; and in Subsection C, Paragraph C(1), added \"except as provided in Paragraph (2) of this subsection\", at the end of Subparagraph C(1)(b), deleted \"and\" and added \"or\", added a new paragraph designation \"(2)\" and redesignated former Paragraphs C(2) and C(3) as Paragraphs C(3) and C(4), respectively.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, added the Paragraph designation C(1)(c) and substituted \"this paragraph\" for \"Paragraphs (1) and (2)\" within that new paragraph; and rewrote the definition of \"felon\" in Paragraph C(2).\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, inserted \"or destructive devices\" in the catchline and \"or destructive device\" in Subsection A; substituted \"fourth degree felony\" for \"misdemeanor\" in Subsection B; and, in Subsection C, added present Paragraph (1) and redesignated former Paragraphs (1) and (2) as present Paragraphs (2) and (3).\n\nA conditional discharge is not a conviction.— Where the district court had entered a conditional discharge order in a prior criminal proceeding against defendant; the order was entered without an adjudication of guilt and with a sentencing term; defendant's probation was subsequently revoked and defendant was placed back on probation; a year later, defendant's probation was again revoked and the district court ordered that defendant be incarcerated; and the district court did not revoke defendant's conditional discharge, the district court did not err by dismissing a later felon in possession charge against defendant on the ground that defendant's conditional discharge had not been revoked and could not serve as the predicate felony for the felon in possession charge.State v. Harris, 2013-NMCA-031, 297 P.3d 374.\n\nBullets as destructive devices.— Nothing in this section says that destructive devices as defined in the section are deadly weapons. It is unreasonable to construe this section to say that destructive devices are necessarily also deadly weapons as defined in Section 30-1-12B NMSA 1978. Even were .22 caliber cartridges to be considered destructive devices under Section 30-7-16, the bullets were not deadly weapons under Section 30-1-12B.State v. Galaz, 2003-NMCA-076, 133 N.M. 794, 70 P.3d 784, cert denied, 133 N.M. 771, 70 P.3d 761.\n\nPossession of firearms by felons.— The fact that New Mexico law does not forbid possession of firearms by those convicted of felonies more than 10 years ago does not preclude the federal government from doing so. United States v. Fuentes, 119 Fed. Appx. 248 (2004).\n\nAdmission of unavailable accomplice's tape recorded custodial police interviewwas not harmless error because it provided only direct evidence that defendant held firearm, it contradicted state's otherwise circumstantial case, and defendant expressly denied ever holding firearm.State v. Johnson, 2004-NMSC-029, 136 N.M. 348, 98 P.3d 998, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1177, 125 S. Ct. 1334, 161 L. Ed. 2d 162.\n\nNo preemption by federal firearms act.— Although federal law excludes antique firearms from the proscription of receipt of firearms by certain convicted felons while this section does not, this section is not preempted by the federal law.State v. Haddenham, 1990-NMCA-048, 110 N.M. 149, 793 P.2d 279, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 72, 792 P.2d 49, and cert. denied, 110 N.M. 183, 793 P.2d 865.\n\nProof of all three aspects not required for conviction.— Thus, the defendant could be convicted for the crime of felon transporting a firearm even though there was no evidence that he possessed or owned the firearm. This section prohibits receiving, transporting, or possessing any firearm; the use of the disjunctive \"or\" indicates that this section may be violated by any of the enumerated methods.State v. Dunsmore, 1995-NMCA-012, 119 N.M. 431, 891 P.2d 572.\n\n\"Constructive\" possession.— Where state could not prove that defendant had actual possession of gun, the state can rely on a theory of \"constructive\" possession; that defendant knew the gun was present and exercised control over it.State v. Garcia, 2004-NMCA-066, 135 N.M. 595, 92 P.3d 41,rev'd on other grounds, 2005-NMSC-017, 138 N.M. 1, 116 P.3d 72.\n\nEvidence sufficient for conviction of possession.— Documentary evidence of a prior felony conviction and defendant's numerous statements during the interrogation that he possessed several of the victim's firearms is sufficient evidence for the conviction of felon in possession of a firearm.State v. Lopez, 2005-NMSC-036, 138 N.M. 521, 123 P.3d 754,overruled on other grounds byState v. Frawley, 2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\nSufficient evidence of being a felon in possession of a firearm.— Where defendant was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm after taking a gun inside a Las Cruces club, there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction, because based on evidence presented at trial that defendant told the officer that he was armed with a gun, a witness told the officer over the phone that defendant had a gun, and police recovered a handgun inside the club, a reasonable jury could have found that defendant had knowledge and control, and thereby possession, of a gun.State v. Jimenez, 2017-NMCA-039, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of unlawful transportation of a firearm.— Where defendant was convicted of unlawful transportation of a firearm, and where defendant admitted that he was a felon at the time of the charged offense, and where the state presented evidence at trial that he was driving his accomplice around town and was aware that his accomplice had brought a gun into the car, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that defendant transported a firearm.State v. Torres, 2018-NMSC-013.\n\nDefense of duressis available against the charge of felon in possession of a firearm only when no reasonable alternatives are available — a reasonable felon would resort to possession of a firearm only when committing the offense is the only reasonable alternative.State v. Castrillo, 1991-NMSC-096, 112 N.M. 766, 819 P.2d 1324.\n\nDistrict court properly refused to submit the defense of duress to the jury, where defendant, a convicted felon, could have contacted the police, or simply avoided his estranged wife after she smashed his car windshield, but instead he chose to arm himself by purchasing a handgun.State v. Castrillo, 1991-NMSC-096, 112 N.M. 766, 819 P.2d 1324.\n\nNo exception for self-defense.— This statute does not exclude from its operation felons who are defending themselves.State v. Calvillo, 1990-NMCA-046, 110 N.M. 114, 792 P.2d 1157, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 72, 792 P.2d 49 (1991).\n\nConstrued with 31-18-17 NMSA 1978.— Where defendants were convicted of the charge of felon in possession of a firearm contrary to 30-7-16 NMSA 1978, and the defendants were also sentenced as habitual offenders in accordance with 31-18-17 NMSA 1978, the trial court erred in sentencing the defendants as habitual offenders when the same prior felony convictions were relied upon to convict the defendants of the underlying offense of felon in possession of a firearm.State v. Haddenham, 1990-NMCA-048, 110 N.M. 149, 793 P.2d 279, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 72, 792 P.2d 49, and cert. denied, 110 N.M. 183, 793 P.2d 865.\n\nUse of prior felony.— The state was not prevented from using distinct felonies obtained in the same judgment and sentence for the separate purposes of enhancement under the felon in possession statute and the general habitual offender statute.State v. Calvillo, 1990-NMCA-046, 112 N.M. 140, 812 P.2d 794, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 77, 811 P.2d 575 (1991).\n\nIn this case it did not matter that the state did not specify which of the two felonies it was relying on to prove the principal crime, whichever felony the jury relied on, there was an additional one available for sentence enhancement. If the jury relied on both, there is still no double jeopardy problem.State v. Dunsmore, 1995-NMCA-012, 119 N.M. 431, 891 P.2d 572.\n\nDetails of the prior crime are irrelevant to prove the required element of the crime of being a felon in possession, and admission into evidence of the defendant's prior conviction of a firearms offense was reversible error.State v. Tave, 1996-NMCA-056, 122 N.M. 29, 919 P.2d 1094.\n\nMultiple uses of prior convictions does not violate double jeopardy.— Where defendant's prior felony convictions were used to establish defendant's status as a habitual offender for sentencing for attempted murder and to serve as the predicate felony for defendant's conviction of felon in possession of a firearm, the double jeopardy clause was not violated.State v. Tafoya, 2012-NMSC-030, 285 P.3d 604.\n\nThe felon in possession statute is insurmountably ambiguous as to the unit of prosecution.— Where defendant was charged with two counts of possession of a firearm by a felon after law enforcement officers, while executing a search warrant at defendant's residence, discovered two handguns in defendant's bedroom, and where, at a pretrial motion hearing, the district court, based on the facts in the state's criminal complaint, granted defendant's motion to dismiss one of the two counts for violating defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy, it was error for the district court to rule on the double jeopardy issue based on the limited record at the time of the motion hearing, because the felon in possession statute is insurmountably ambiguous as to the unit of prosecution and the district court did not address the second step of the unit of prosecution analysis to determine whether defendant's acts were separated by sufficient indicia of distinctness to justify multiple punishments under the same statute; the record did not adequately address the indicia for weapons possession, such as the timing of the gaining of possession of the weapons, the spacing between the weapons, the quality or nature of the weapons, and the results of the possession, and therefore defendant's motion did not present a purely legal issue resolvable under 5-601(C) NMRA and the district court erred by ruling on the merits of the motion without a stipulation of facts or an evidentiary hearing.State v. Gonzales, 2024-NMCA-062.\n\nJury instruction.— In a prosecution for being a felon in possession of a firearm, it was reversible error for the court to use UJI 14-1701 NMRA naming the predicate offense,i.e., aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.State v. Tave, 1996-NMCA-056, 122 N.M. 29, 919 P.2d 1094.\n\nUnsubstantiated reference to drug dealer gun owner inappropriate.— Repeated references to defendant as a known drug dealer when the state lacked sufficient evidence to convict defendant of possession or distribution of illegal drugs, and instead relied on unsubstantiated hearsay to convince the jury defendant was a \"known drug dealer\" so, ipso facto, the shotgun must belong to him is prohibited and should be excluded.State v. Rael, 1994-NMCA-043, 117 N.M. 539, 873 P.2d 285.\n\nRestoration of firearms privileges.— Firearm privileges are automatically restored when a person successfully completes the period of a deferred sentence. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-03.\n\nPartial pardon by governor limiting right to use firearm.— The governor has the power under the New Mexico Constitution to grant a partial pardon conferring the right to vote and hold public office while denying the right to possess a firearm. 1992 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 92-09.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Evidence Law Boundaries, Balancing, and Prior Felony Convictions: After United States v. Old Chief,\" see 28 N.M. L. Rev. 583 (1998).\n\nAm.
