      "text": "Resisting, evading or obstructing an officer consists of:\n\nA. knowingly obstructing, resisting or opposing any officer of this state or any other duly authorized person serving or attempting to serve or execute any process or any rule or order of any of the courts of this state or any other judicial writ or process;\n\nB. intentionally fleeing, attempting to evade or evading an officer of this state when the person committing the act of fleeing, attempting to evade or evasion has knowledge that the officer is attempting to apprehend or arrest him;\n\nC. willfully refusing to bring a vehicle to a stop when given a visual or audible signal to stop, whether by hand, voice, emergency light, flashing light, siren or other signal, by a uniformed officer in an appropriately marked police vehicle; or\n\nD. resisting or abusing any judge, magistrate or peace officer in the lawful discharge of his duties.\n\nWhoever commits resisting, evading or obstructing an officer is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-22-1, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 22-1; 1981, ch. 248, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For authority of conservation officers to enforce these provisions under emergency circumstances,see17-2-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nLesser included offense.— Resisting or abusing a peace officer is a lesser included offense within battery on a peace officer under the Blockburger test.State v. Ford, 2007-NMCA-052, 141 N.M. 512, 157 P.3d 77, cert. denied, 2007 NMCERT 004, 141 N.M. 568, 158 P.3d 458.\n\nResisting an officer is a lesser included offense of peace officer battery; the only difference between the two is that peace officer battery requires the resisting or abusing to culminate in a touching, while resisting does not.State v. Padilla, 1983-NMCA-096, 101 N.M. 78, 678 P.2d 706,aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 1984-NMSC-026, 101 N.M. 58, 678 P.2d 686,aff'dsub nom. Fugate v. New Mexico, 470 U.S. 904, 105 S. Ct. 1858 (1985), 84 L. Ed. 2d 777.\n\nConduct constituting an offense.— Driving for two miles without responding to a police officer's emergency lights is behavior which violates Section 30-22-1C NMSA 1978.Marshall v. Columbia Lea Regional Hosp., 345 F.3d 1157 (10th Cir. 2003).\n\nViolation of Subsection C.— If a stopped driver knows that an officer is trying to effectuate an arrest, then Section 30-22-1B NMSA 1978 applies if the driver tries to leave.State v. Baldonado, 1992-NMCA-140, 115 N.M. 106, 847 P.2d 751, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 145, 848 P.2d 531 (1993).\n\nNo probable cause.— Where police officers went to defendant's home to interview defendant about defendant's co-worker who was suspected to be involved in a rape; defendant was cooperative and invited the officers into defendant's home; during the interview, defendant decided to end the interview and asked the officers to leave; when the officers refused, defendant became agitated, and the officers arrested defendant because the officers speculated that defendant could have been more cooperative and shared more information about the suspect, the officers did not have probable cause to arrest defendant for resisting, evading, obstructing, or refusing to obey an officer.Manzanares v. Higdon, 575 F. 3d 1135 (10th Cir. 2009).\n\nWhere police officers were investigating defendant's child for commission of a felony; defendant told the officers that defendant did not know the child's birth date and address; when the officers asked defendant for identification, defendant responded that the identification was in defendant's house; and defendant started walking toward defendant's house, the officers did not have probable cause to arrest defendant for resisting, evading or obstructing an officer.Keylon v. City of Albuquerque, 535 F. 3d 1210 (10th Cir. 2008).\n\nThe word \"apprehend\"includes a situation in which an officer is attempting to briefly detain a person for questioning based on reasonable suspicion.State v. Gutierrez, 2007-NMSC-033, 142 N.M. 1, 162 P.3d 156.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where a police officer had one handcuff on defendant when defendant pulled away and the officer had to forcibly finish handcuffing defendant, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for resisting, evading or obstructing an officer.State v. Wilson, 2007-NMCA-111, 142 N.M. 737, 169 P.3d 1184, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-008, 142 N.M. 435, 166 P.3d 1089.\n\nWhere police officers arrested defendant for DWI; defendant argued with the officers and refused to cooperate; defendant would not put defendant's legs into the police car preventing the officers from closing the door; when the officers forced defendant's legs into the car, defendant placed defendant's head in a position that prevented the officer from closing the door; defendant intentionally fell out of the car; defendant twice kicked one officer, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of resisting and abusing an officer.State v. Cotton, 2011-NMCA-096, 150 N.M. 583, 263 P.3d 925, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-008, 268 P.3d 513.\n\nWhere police officers were investigating potential drug manufacturing; the officers were in plain clothes and driving unmarked vehicles; the officers were following defendant when defendant made a U-turn and stopped; one officer approached defendant's vehicle, displayed a badge, and said that the officer wanted to talk with defendant; defendant asked the officer what was going on and the officer again identified the officer as a police officer; defendant began creeping defendant's vehicle toward the officer; the other officer then approached defendant's vehicle, identified the officer as a police officer and displayed a badge; and when the other officer opened the door of defendant's vehicle and told the occupants to show their hands, defendant accelerated the vehicle and the other officer was thrown from the vehicle, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of resisting, evading, and obstructing an officer.State v. Akers, 2010-NMCA-103, 149 N.M. 53, 243 P.3d 757.\n\nWhere the defendant and the defendant's vehicle matched the descriptions given to the officer by the victim of stalking; the officer asked the defendant to stop; the defendant said he needed to use the bathroom in the house where he had parked his vehicle; the officer followed the defendant into the house, but the defendant ran out the back door after he turned and saw the officer behind him and began to run, the officer had reasonable suspicion to temporarily detain the defendant for questioning and the defendant did not have the right to walk away from the officer.State v. Gutierrez, 2007-NMSC-033, 142 N.M. 1, 162 P.3d 156.\n\nSection not vague.— There is no merit to claim that this section is vague on its face.State v. Andazola, 1981-NMCA-002, 95 N.M. 430, 622 P.2d 1050.\n\nSection places those interfering with officer on notice of criminal sanctions.— In clear simple language, this statute puts everyone on notice that one would be exposed to criminal sanctions if he resisted or abused any peace officer who was engaged in the lawful discharge of his duties.State v. Andazola, 1981-NMCA-002, 95 N.M. 430, 622 P.2d 1050.\n\nConviction under this section does not bar civil rights claim.— Plaintiff's action under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 alleging that police officers used excessive force against him would not be barred by his conviction for resisting arrest, whether based on Subsection A or Subsection D.Martinez v. City of Albuquerque, 184 F.3d 1123 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\nConstruction of former law.— Former 40-31-4 and 40-31-5, 1953 Comp., made it unlawful to obstruct justice, the former relating to obstructing an officer in serving process and the latter to resisting or abusing an officer while executing the duties of his office.City of Clovis v. Archie, 1955-NMSC-105, 60 N.M. 239, 290 P.2d 1075.\n\nApplicability of former law.— Kearny Code, Crimes and Punishments, art. 3, § 4, prescribing penalty for obstruction or assaulting officer serving process was not applicable where the sheriff was not armed with process.State v. Welch, 1933-NMSC-084, 37 N.M. 549, 25 P.2d 211 (decided under prior law).\n\nResisting sheriff formerly serious offense.— Under former law, resisting a sheriff was itself a felony.State v. Smelcer, 1924-NMSC-059, 30 N.M. 122, 228 P. 183;seeState v. Welch, 1933-NMSC-084, 37 N.M. 549, 25 P.2d 211 (resistance to a sheriff making a lawful arrest, but not armed with process, a misdemeanor) (decided under prior law).\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Where defendant led police on a high-speed automobile chase and then got out of his car and fled on foot, his acts supported only one crime founded on resisting, evading or obstructing an officer, and vacation of his convictions for two counts of evading an officer was required.State v. Lefebre, 2001-NMCA-009, 130 N.M. 130, 19 P.3d 825.\n\nJurisdictional exception.— The jurisdictional exception to double jeopardy permitted defendant's prosecution in the district court on a charge of peace officer battery, after he had pleaded guilty to several misdemeanors, including resisting arrest, in the magistrate court.State v. Padilla, 1984-NMSC-026, 101 N.M. 58, 678 P.2d 686,aff'dsub nom., Fugate v. New Mexico, 470 U.S. 904, 105 S. Ct. 1858, 84 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1985).\n\nConviction varying from crime charged in information.— The defendant was properly convicted of resisting, evading or obstructing an officer, because the evidence supported the verdict of the jury to that charge, and his opportunity to prepare and defend against the charge was not impaired by the fact that such an offense varied from the crime charged in the criminal information,i.e., aggravated assault upon a peace officer.State v. Hamilton, 1988-NMCA-023, 107 N.M. 186, 754 P.2d 857, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 132, 753 P.2d 1320.\n\n\"Abusing\" speech equated to \"fighting\" words.— \"Abusing\" speech in Subsection D covers only speech that can be called \"fighting\" words. Any other interpretation of that subsection applied to speech would render it unconstitutional.State v. Wade, 1983-NMCA-084, 100 N.M. 152, 667 P.2d 459.\n\n\"Fighting\" wordsare those which tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.State v. Wade, 1983-NMCA-084, 100 N.M. 152, 667 P.2d 459.\n\nSelf-defense distinguished from resisting unlawful arrest.— The right of self-defense against a police officer is a concept different from the right to resist an unlawful arrest, in that self-defense is for the purpose of protecting a person's bodily integrity and health, whereas the purpose of resisting an unlawful arrest is to prevent the arrest.State v. Kraul, 1977-NMCA-032, 90 N.M. 314, 563 P.2d 108, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nLimits of right to self-defense.— One has a right to defend oneself from a police officer, whether the attempted arrest is lawful or unlawful; this right, however, is limited, so that one may defend oneself against excessive use of force by the officer, but one may not resort to self-defense when the officer is using necessary force to effect an arrest.State v. Kraul, 1977-NMCA-032, 90 N.M. 314, 563 P.2d 108, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter while resisting arrest.— Instruction that killing an officer while resisting a lawful arrest was murder in first or second degree was error, since resistance to arrest, where sheriff was not armed with process, was a misdemeanor and death without malice resulting therefrom was involuntary manslaughter.State v. Welch, 1933-NMSC-084, 37 N.M. 549, 25 P.2d 211.\n\nLesser included offense instruction.— In a prosecution for aggravated assault on a peace officer, since there was evidence that resisting in violation of either Subsection B or D was the highest degree of crime committed, the defendant was entitled to a charge on the lesser offense.State v. Diaz, 1995-NMCA-137, 121 N.M. 28, 908 P.2d 258, cert. denied, 120 N.M. 828, 907 P.2d 1009.\n\nInstruction on self-defense.— Defendant had a limited right of self-defense against police officer, and was entitled to an instruction on that limited right, which the instruction did not cover since it went only to the arrest and did not refer to the right to defend against excessive force whether or not the arrest was unlawful.State v. Kraul, 1977-NMCA-032, 90 N.M. 314, 563 P.2d 108, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nDefense of another against excessive police force is a viable defense.— The right to defense of another against a police officer is not absolute; it does not exist if the officer is using necessary force to effect an arrest. However, a defendant is entitled to a defense of another jury instruction if an officer used force against another that was unreasonable and unnecessary.State v. Jones, 2020-NMCA-029.\n\nWhere defendant was charged with battery upon a peace officer and resisting or abusing an officer, and where defendant requested a defense of another jury instruction, the district court erred in denying the request and in finding that defending another against excessive force by a police officer was not a viable defense, because defense of another against excessive police force is a viable defense and reasonable minds could differ as to whether the officers used excessive force in this case.State v. Jones, 2020-NMCA-029.\n\nAcquittal bars retrial for battery.— After a magistrate's determination that the defendant was not guilty of resisting and obstructing an officer and disorderly conduct because he was acting in defense of another, the state cannot charge him with battery on a police officer and constitutionally bring him before a new fact finder to relitigate that same factual issue.State v. Orosco, 1982-NMCA-181, 99 N.M. 180, 655 P.2d 1024.\n\nEvidence insufficient for conviction.— In the absence of evidence that defendant verbally resisted, evaded or obstructed a police officer, her refusal to allow the officer admission into her home could not be considered unlawful, and the trial court erred in denying her motion for a directed verdict.State v. Prince, 1999-NMCA-010, 126 N.M. 547, 972 P.2d 859.\n\nInsufficient evidence of evading an officer.— Where defendant was charged with intentionally fleeing, attempting to evade or evading an officer after taking a gun inside a Las Cruces club, there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction, because although defendant refused to comply with the officer's orders to surrender from inside the club, the state failed to present any evidence that defendant fled, attempted to evade, or evaded the officers before they were able to arrest him, and there was no evidence presented to suggest that defendant surreptitiously tried to escape from the building, such as out the back or side door, in order to evade arrest.State v. Jimenez, 2017-NMCA-039, cert. denied.\n\nBurden of proof.— In order to convict defendant of evading and eluding a police officer, the state had the burden of proving that officer was a peace officer engaged in the lawful discharge of his duty and defendant, with knowledge that officer was attempting to apprehend or arrest him, fled, attempted to evade, or evaded officer.State v. Gutierrez, 2005-NMCA-093, 138 N.M. 147, 117 P.3d 953,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2007-NMSC-033, 142 N.M. 1, 162 P.3d 156.\n\nReversal was warranted where defendant was convicted of a crime that the state had not charged.— Where defendant was charged and convicted of resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer pursuant to § 30-22-1(D) NMSA 1978, but where, at trial, the state used, with some customization, the alternative from the uniform jury instruction that corresponds to § 30-22-1(C) NMSA 1978, the jury was not instructed on the \"resisting or abusing\" elements of § 30-22-1(D) that differentiates the offense from other forms of resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer. Reversal was therefore warranted, because the jury convicted defendant of a crime for which he had not been charged.State v. Ocon, 2021-NMCA-032, cert. denied.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment on State v. Selgado, 76 N.M. 187, 413 P.2d 469 (1966), see 7 Nat. Resources J. 119 (1967).\n\nFor annual survey of New Mexico law relating to criminal law, see 12 N.M.L. Rev. 229 (1982).\n\nFor annual survey of New Mexico Criminal Procedure, see 20 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. Aggravated fleeing a law enforcement officer consists of a person willfully and carelessly driving a vehicle in a manner that endangers the life of another person after being given a visual or audible signal to stop, whether by hand, voice, emergency light, flashing light, siren or other signal, by a uniformed law enforcement officer in an authorized emergency vehicle pursuant to Section 66-7-6 NMSA 1978 in pursuit in accordance with the provisions of the Law Enforcement Safe Pursuit Act [29-20-1 to 29-20-4 NMSA 1978].\n\nB. Whoever commits aggravated fleeing a law enforcement officer that does not result in injury or great bodily harm to another person is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nC. Whoever commits aggravated fleeing a law enforcement officer that results in injury to another person is guilty of a third degree felony.\n\nHistory:Laws 2003, ch. 260, § 5; 2022, ch. 56, § 27.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective May 18, 2022, added penalties for aggravated fleeing a law enforcement officer; in Subsection A, after \"by a uniformed law enforcement officer in an\", deleted \"appropriately marked law enforcement vehicle\" and added \"authorized emergency vehicle pursuant to Section 66-7-6 NMSA 1978\"; in Subsection B, after \"fleeing a law enforcement officer\", added \"that does not result in injury or great bodily harm to another person\"; and added Subsection C.\n\nCompliance with the policies of the Law Enforcement Safe Pursuit Act(Section 29-20-1 NMSA 1978) is not an essential element of the crime of aggravated fleeing.State v. Padilla, 2008-NMSC-006, 143 N.M. 310, 176 P.3d 299.\n\nCompliance with local policy is not an essential element of aggravated fleeing.— Where defendant was charged with aggravated fleeing, the district did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence relating to the county's high speed pursuit policy, because a local policy adopted pursuant to the Law Enforcement Safe Pursuit Act (Section 29 20 1 NMSA 1978] is not an element of the crime of aggravated fleeing.State v. Coleman, 2011-NMCA-087, 150 N.M. 622, 264 P.3d 523, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-008, 268 P.3d 513.\n\nProof of compliance with the Pursuit Act (Law Enforcement Safe Pursuit Act, Section 29 20 1 NMSA 1978).— If defendant claims that a pursuit was not made in accordance with the Pursuit Act, the State must offer evidence to prove that the local pursuit policy complies with the requirements of the Act.State v. Ross, 2007-NMCA-126, 142 N.M. 597, 168 P.3d 169, cert. granted, 2007-NMCERT-009, 142 N.M. 716, 169 P.3d 409.\n\nSubstantial evidence.— Where defendant, who was being chased by a police officer, drove at speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour through residential areas and ignored and drove through several stop signs also while traveling at excessive speeds; and the chase ended only when defendant struck a curb and damaged defendant's vehicle rendering it immobile, there was sufficient evidence that defendant drove willfully and carelessly, endangering the life of other persons.State v. Coleman, 2011-NMCA-087, 150 N.M. 622, 264 P.3d 523, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-008, 268 P.3d 513.\n\nSufficient evidence of aggravated fleeing.— In defendant's trial for first-degree murder for the killing of a police officer and aggravated fleeing, there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions where the evidence established that during a traffic stop, the officer attempted to approach the vehicle when the vehicle suddenly accelerated out of a parking lot, and where defendant later brought the vehicle to a stop and waited for the pursuing officer to catch up, and when the officer approached the vehicle a second time, defendant fired his gun four times at the officer, and that upon fleeing from the scene of the shooting, defendant drove his vehicle away from a uniformed law enforcement officer in an appropriately marked law enforcement vehicle and in a manner that endangered the lives of others. Defendant's flight from the fallen officer was part of a continuing course of aggravated fleeing.State v. Romero, 2019-NMSC-007.\n\nAggravated fleeing does not require that an identifiable person was actually endangered as a result of the driver's conduct.— Where defendant was convicted of aggravated fleeing a law enforcement officer after he led an officer on a high-speed chase through rain-slicked streets during the early morning hours, and where defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction because the crime of aggravated fleeing requires proof that a defendant drove in a manner that actually endangered the life of another individual and in this case, no person was actually in the vicinity of the pursuit, the New Mexico supreme court held that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction because the statute requires proof that the defendant drove so dangerously that his or her conduct endangered the lives of others, but does not require that an identifiable person was actually endangered as a result of the defendant's flight from law enforcement. It is the conduct of fleeing the police by driving dangerously, not the result of the conduct, that violates the aggravated fleeing statute, and in this case there was evidence that defendant displayed dangerous driving that put people in the community at risk of harm when he sped at seventy miles per hour on town roads, refused to slow down while passing an apartment complex, and drove onto a sidewalk and crashed into a road sign.State v. Vest, 2021-NMSC-020,rev'g2018-NMCA-060, 428 P.3d 287.\n\nActual endangerment of another person is an essential element of aggravated fleeing.— Where defendant was charged with aggravated fleeing of a law enforcement officer following a high-speed chase in which defendant drove at least seventy miles per hour through a residential area, on a wet and slippery road, with at least one curve in it, crashing the car into a traffic sign, rendering the car inoperable, and getting out of the car and leaving it in the middle of the roadway, the state failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that defendant's flight from police actually endangered another person when the uncontroverted testimony was that defendant never encountered any other motorists on the roadway.State v. Vest, 2018-NMCA-060, cert. granted.\n\nWhere defendant was charged with aggravated fleeing of a law enforcement officer following a high-speed chase in which defendant drove his motorcycle through parking lots, drove on several side streets in which he ran several stop signs, and drove on the highway exceeding the speed limit, causing other motorists to pull off the road, the state failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that defendant endangered another person when the uncontroverted testimony of two participating officers was that the pursuit did not create a public safety issue or place any person in danger.State v. Chavez, 2016-NMCA-016, 365 P.3d 61,vacated byN.M. Sup. Ct. Order No. S-1-SC-35614 (Aug. 24, 2016).\n\n\"Uniformed law enforcement officer\" construed.— The meaning of \"uniform\" is a dress of a distinctive design or fashion that serves to identify the individual wearing it as a law enforcement officer.State v. Montano, 2020-NMSC-009,aff'g in part and rev'g in part2018-NMCA-047, 423 P.3d 1 andrev'gState v. Martinez, A-1-CA-35111, mem. op. (May 14, 2018) (nonprecedential).\n\n\"Appropriately marked law enforcement vehicle\" construed.— A plain meaning construction of \"appropriately marked law enforcement vehicle\" contemplates that such a vehicle must bear a character, device, label, brand, seal, or other sign that not only makes it suitable to be driven by a law enforcement officer, but also sets it apart as specially suitable to law enforcement use.State v. Montano, 2020-NMSC-009,aff'g in part and rev'g in part2018-NMCA-047, 423 P.3d 1 andrev'g State v. Martinez, A-1-CA-35111, mem. op. (May 14, 2018) (nonprecedential).\n\nStatute requires officer to be in uniform and in an appropriately marked law enforcement vehicle.— In consolidated cases where both defendants were charged with aggravated fleeing from a law enforcement officer where the deputies in each case were driving unmarked patrol vehicles that bore no insignias, stripes, decals, labels, seals, symbols, or other pictorial signs or lettering indicating their identity as law enforcement vehicles, and where in one case the officer's attire included a dress shirt with tie, dress slacks, and dress shoes, the New Mexico supreme court held that the officer's attire was not a \"uniform\" as required by this section because his clothing did not in any way distinguish the deputy as a law enforcement officer, and that the vehicles that the deputies were driving were not \"appropriately marked law enforcement vehicles\" because they bore no insignias, stripes, decals, labels, seals, symbols or other pictorial signs or lettering indicating their identity as law enforcement vehicles.State v. Montano, 2020-NMSC-009,aff'g in part and rev'g in part2018-NMCA-047, 423 P.3d 1 andrev'g State v. Martinez, A-1-CA-35111, mem. op. (May 14, 2018) (nonprecedential).\n\nPlain meaning of \"uniformed law enforcement officer\".— A \"uniformed law enforcement officer\" consists of an officer wearing clothing of a distinctive design or fashion clearly indicating the peace officer's official status and distinguishing the wearer from the general public.State v. Montano, 2018-NMCA-047, cert. granted.\n\nPlain meaning of \"appropriately marked law enforcement vehicle\".— A law enforcement vehicle that is \"appropriately marked\" is marked in a manner that is suitable for being driven by a law enforcement officer and identified as such.State v. Montano, 2018-NMCA-047, cert. granted.\n\nIntent of the requirements that law enforcement officer be in uniform and in an appropriately marked vehicle.— The intent of this section's uniform and appropriately marked law enforcement vehicle requirements is to establish a defendant's knowledge that he is fleeing a police officer.State v. Montano, 2018-NMCA-047, cert. granted.\n\nWhere a deputy sheriff, working as an investigator and wearing a dress shirt with tie, dress slacks and dress shoes and displaying his badge on the breast pocket of his shirt, and driving a Ford expedition that had no decals, striping, insignia, or lettering, but had a government license plate, wigwag headlights, red and blue flashing lights mounted on the grill and the top of the rear window, flashing brake lights, and a siren, attempted to stop defendant's vehicle for a vehicle registration infraction by utilizing the red and blue flashing lights on his vehicle and siren, and where defendant failed to stop, drove through a residential neighborhood at speeds that exceeded the posted speed limit, and failed to stop at stop signs and intersections, there was insufficient evidence to convict defendant of aggravated fleeing, because although the deputy's vehicle was \"appropriately marked\" as that term is used in 30-22-1.1(A) NMSA 1978 because the emergency lights and siren identified the vehicle as a law enforcement vehicle, the deputy was not \"uniformed\" as that term is used in 30-22-1.1(A) because the deputy's clothing, even with his badge affixed to his shirt, was not sufficient to identify him as a law enforcement officer.State v. Montano, 2018-NMCA-047, cert. granted.",

      "text": "Concealing identity consists of concealing one's true name or identity, or disguising oneself with intent to obstruct the due execution of the law or with intent to intimidate, hinder or interrupt any public officer or any other person in a legal performance of his duty or the exercise of his rights under the laws of the United States or of this state.\n\nWhoever commits concealing identity is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-22-3, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 22-3.\n\nConstitutionality.— This section is not unconstitutionally vague on the basis that it does not provide a time limit within which one must disclose one's identity.State v. Dawson, 1999-NMCA-072, 127 N.M. 472, 983 P.2d 421.\n\nTime for response to request for identification.— This section requires a person to furnish identifying information immediately upon request or, if the person has reasonable concerns about the validity of the request, so soon thereafter as not to cause substantial inconvenience or expense to law enforcement officers.State v. Dawson, 1999-NMCA-072, 127 N.M. 472, 983 P.2d 421.\n\nConcealing information other than true name.— Identity is not limited to name alone; thus, in the context of a valid traffic stop, a failure to provide the information contained in a driver's license (address, date of birth and social security number) falls within the reach of this section regardless of whether a driver also provides his or her true name.State v. Andrews, 1997-NMCA-017, 123 N.M. 95, 934 P.2d 289.\n\nInformation supplied during traffic stop.— This section is sufficiently definite, in the context of a valid traffic stop, so that ordinary drivers would understand that they had to provide more than just a name, and the authority to request such identification does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement.State v. Andrews, 1997-NMCA-017, 123 N.M. 95, 934 P.2d 289.\n\nUse of section as defense to tort.— The defendant was entitled to qualified immunity since the facts and circumstances within his knowledge would have led a reasonable officer to conclude that the plaintiff concealed his identity in violation of this section.Albright v. Rodriquez, 51 F.3d 1531 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\nEvidence sufficient for conviction.— Since the overwhelming evidence was that the defendant responded with profanity and recalcitrance to multiple requests that he produce some identification and a person genuinely puzzled by those requests most likely would have queried the officers rather than responding belligerently, the record contains sufficient evidence for the district court to reasonably conclude the defendant violated both 30-20-1 NMSA 1978 and this section.United States v. Stenzel, 49 F.3d 658 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 840, 116 S. Ct. 123, 133 L. Ed. 2d 73 (1995).\n\nSufficient evidence of concealing identity.— Where a law enforcement officer, in response to a report of a male subject acting suspiciously, observed defendant jumping back and forth over the fence of a business establishment in the early hours of the morning, and where defendant declined to give the officer his name, there was sufficient evidence to find that the officer was acting in the legal performance of her duty as a police officer in stopping defendant, and that defendant concealed his name or identity with the intent to obstruct, hinder or delay the officer's investigation.State v. Ortiz, 2017-NMCA-006, cert. denied.\n\n\"Legal performance of duty\" construed.— This section mandates that the officer asking for identity be acting in the \"legal performance of his duty,\" which requires that the state prove that the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain and question a defendant.State v. Aguilar, 2021-NMCA-018, cert. denied.\n\nThe evidence of reasonable suspicion was insufficient to support defendant's concealing identity conviction.— Where defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance and concealing identity after a restaurant manager called police to report that a group of people, which included defendant, was engaged in possible drug activity at the restaurant, and where defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence seized from him following his arrest, claiming that reasonable suspicion of the commission of a crime is a required element of concealing identity, and that the state failed to introduce sufficient evidence at trial to prove that the arresting officer had reasonable suspicion, defendant's conviction for concealing identity was not supported by substantial evidence, because a detention for questioning about identity is not within a \"legal performance of the officer's duty\" unless that officer has reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is being committed, and in this case, the only evidence the officer offered at trial was that he was dispatched to the restaurant because the restaurant's manager suspected that a group of people, which included defendant, were using drugs inside the restroom. This evidence is insufficient to establish that the officer had a reasonable suspicion, based on the facts and circumstances known to him, that defendant had criminally trespassed on the restaurant premises or that defendant was engaged in drug activity.State v. Aguilar, 2021-NMCA-018, cert. denied.\n\nOfficer must have a reasonable suspicion of underlying crime before arresting for concealing identity.— Where plaintiff, an independent journalist who films content for his YouTube channel, brought a federal civil action against the city of Artesia and an Artesia police officer, alleging that his arrest for concealing his identity while filming a refinery in Artesia, New Mexico while on public property violated his constitutional rights, and where defendants moved for summary judgment, claiming that the arresting officer did not have to identify a specific crime to find reasonable suspicion existed, summary judgment was denied because this section requires that before an officer arrests an individual for concealing identity, the officer must have at least reasonable suspicion that the individual was involved in some predicate, underlying crime, and in this case, a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the police officer had reasonable suspicion to investigate, and thus demand identification from, the independent journalist who was filming a refinery from a public location while walking along a public way.Bustillos v. City of Artesia, 591 F. Supp.3d 1051 (D. N.M. 2022).\n\nQualified immunity of arresting officer.— In a civil rights action against a police officer who arrested the plaintiff for failing to provide proper identification during a traffic stop, the officer did not violate the plaintiff's clearly established rights and was entitled to qualified immunity.Nagol v. New Mexico, 923 F. Supp. 190 (D.N.M. 1996).\n\nConstitutional challenge not ripe.— Since the plaintiff was arrested but not convicted for a violation of this section and failed to show a credible threat that he might be arrested under this section in the future, he could not challenge the validity of the section in federal court.Nagol v. New Mexico, 923 F. Supp. 190 (D.N.M. 1996).\n\nAm.

Tampering with evidence consists of destroying, changing, hiding, placing or fabricating any physical evidence with intent to prevent the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any person or to throw suspicion of the commission of a crime upon another.\n\nB. Whoever commits tampering with evidence shall be punished as follows:\n\n(1) if the highest crime for which tampering with evidence is committed is a capital or first degree felony or a second degree felony, the person committing tampering with evidence is guilty of a third degree felony;\n\n(2) if the highest crime for which tampering with evidence is committed is a third degree felony or a fourth degree felony, the person committing tampering with evidence is guilty of a fourth degree felony;\n\n(3) if the highest crime for which tampering with evidence is committed is a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the person committing tampering with evidence is guilty of a petty misdemeanor; and\n\n(4) if the highest crime for which tampering with evidence is committed is indeterminate, the person committing tampering with evidence is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-22-5, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 22-5; 2003, ch. 296, § 1.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, redesignated the text of the former section as Subsection A and the preliminary language of Subsection B and added Paragraphs B(1) to (4).\n\nStandard for sufficiency of evidence to support a tampering conviction.— Absent either direct evidence of a defendant's specific intent to tamper or evidence from which the factfinder may infer such intent, the evidence cannot support a tampering conviction.State v. Guerra, 2012-NMSC-027, 284 P.3d 1076.\n\nWhere the state alleged that defendant tampered with evidence based on the fact that defendant had a weapon at the scene of the crime, defendant used the weapon to kill someone, the weapon was removed from the scene of the crime, and the weapon was never recovered, the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support defendant's conviction of tampering with evidence because the state cannot convict a defendant of tampering with evidence simply because evidence that must have once existed cannot be found.State v. Guerra, 2012-NMSC-027, 284 P.3d 1076.\n\nSentencing under the \"indeterminate crime\" provision.— When the state seeks a conviction under Section 30-22-5 NMSA 1978, tampering with evidence of a capital, first or second degree felony, a determination that defendant tampered with evidence related to a capital, first or second degree felony must be made by the jury. Absent this determination, the court is limited to sentencing defendant under the \"indeterminate crime\" provision.State v. Alvarado, 2012-NMCA-089,overruled byState v. Radosevich, 2018-NMSC-028.\n\nWhere defendant was charged with first degree murder and tampering with evidence; and the jury acquitted defendant of murder and convicted defendant of tampering with evidence, defendant was properly sentenced under the indeterminate crime provision of Section 30-22-5 NMSA 1978.State v. Alvarado, 2012-NMCA-089,overruled byState v. Radosevich, 2018-NMSC-028.\n\nFactors that determine punishment are elements of tampering with evidence.— The factors listed in Subsection B of Section 30-22-5 NMSA 1978 are elements of the offense of tampering with evidence, rather than mere sentencing factors.State v. Herrera, 2014-NMCA-007, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nWhere after defendant shot and killed the victim, defendant put the gun in a crawl space under the house; defendant was charged with second-degree murder and tampering with evidence of a capital crime or a first or second degree felony; and the jury instruction on tampering with evidence required the jury to find that defendant hid the gun in an effort to avoid being apprehended, prosecuted or convicted, but did not require the jury to find that the evidence that was tampered with related to a first or second degree felony, the jury instruction omitted an essential element of the crime that the gun was evidence of a capital crime or a first or second degree felony and violated defendant's right under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to have a jury find all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Herrera, 2014-NMCA-007, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nUnconstitutional application of tampering with evidence statute.— Section 30-22-5(B)(4) NMSA 1978 cannot be constitutionally applied to impose greater punishment for commission of tampering where the underlying crime is indeterminate than the punishment prescribed under 30-22-5(B)(3) NMSA 1978 where the underlying crime is a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor.State v. Radosevich, 2018-NMSC-028,rev'g2016-NMCA-060, 376 P.3d 871, andoverrulingState v. Jackson, 2010-NMSC-032, 237 P.3d 754 andState v. Alvarado, 2012-NMCA-089.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of fourth-degree tampering with evidence pursuant to 30-22-5(B)(4) NMSA 1978, although the tampering jury instruction did not identify an underlying offense, defendant's conviction for fourth-degree felony tampering with evidence was a denial due process of law, because to impose a greater penalty for commission of tampering pursuant to Subsection (B)(4), where the evidence does not establish the underlying offense, than for commission of tampering pursuant to 30-22-5(B)(3) NMSA 1978, where the evidence establishes an underlying misdemeanor offense, is both a denial of due process of law and a violation of the accused's right to have a jury determine guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on every element that may establish the range of permissible penalties.State v. Radosevich, 2018-NMSC-028,rev'g2016-NMCA-060, 376 P.3d 871, andoverrulingState v. Jackson, 2010-NMSC-032, 237 P.3d 754 andState v. Alvarado, 2012-NMCA-089.\n\nElements of tampering with evidence.— The degree and identification of the underlying crime to which the tampering offense relates, if any, are elements of tampering that should be decided by the jury. As such, the underlying crime to which tampering relates, if any, should be identified in the tampering instruction and found by the jury. Tampering with evidence can also be a stand-alone crime that is not tied to a separate offense. Where there is no separate identified crime, the tampering offense is linked to an indeterminate crime.State v. Radosevich, 2016-NMCA-060, 376 P.3d 871,rev'd,2018-NMSC-028.\n\nWhere defendant was initially charged with assault with intent to commit murder and tampering with evidence, and where the district court directed a verdict on the charged offense of assault with intent to commit murder and then sua sponte instructed the jury on a new and different charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after the close of evidence, the offense to which defendant's tampering was related failed for insufficient evidence, and defendant's conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon was reversed, rendering the underlying offense for which defendant might have tampered to be an unidentified, indeterminate crime. The district court, therefore, wrongfully convicted defendant of having tampered with evidence of a third- or fourth-degree felony in the absence of such a finding by the jury.State v. Radosevich, 2016-NMCA-060, 376 P.3d 871,rev'd,2018-NMSC-028.\n\nElements of tampering with evidence.— The crime of tampering with evidence is complete when the accused commits an act of tampering with the requisite specific intent to prevent the apprehension, prosecution, or conviction of any person, regardless of whether the accused's objective is a separate crime or whether a separate criminal investigation ever exists or could exist.State v. Jackson, 2010-NMSC-032, 148 N.M. 452, 237 P.3d 754,rev'g2009-NMCA-068, 146 N.M. 563, 212 P.3d 1117,overruled byState v. Radosevich, 2018-NMSC-028.\n\nWhere defendant, who was required as a condition of probation to submit to random urinalyses, reported to the probation office to provide a urine sample with a bottle of clean urine hidden in defendant's pants; the probation officer discovered the bottle of urine when it fell from defendant's pants; and defendant admitted to the probation officer that defendant attempted to provide a false urine sample, defendant was guilty of tampering with evidence.State v. Jackson, 2010-NMSC-032, 148 N.M. 452, 237 P.3d 754,rev'g2009-NMCA-068, 146 N.M. 563, 212 P.3d 1117,overruled byState v. Radosevich, 2018-NMSC-028.\n\nThis section applies only to conduct which interferes with the investigation or prosecution of a crime.State v. Jackson, 2009-NMCA-068, 146 N.M. 563, 212 P.3d 1117;rev'd, 2010-NMSC-032, 148 N.M. 452, 237 P.3d 754,overruled byState v. Radosevich, 2018-NMSC-028.\n\nPartial destruction of evidence.— Where the defendant swiped a portion of white powder on a laminated card that was found in the defendant's wallet with his thumb and ate the powder, the defendant was guilty of tampering with evidence and an instruction on the lesser included offense of attempted tampering with evidence was not warranted, even though the defendant had not destroyed all of the white powder on the card.State v. McClennen, 2008-NMCA-130, 144 N.M. 878, 192 P.3d 1255.\n\nThe fact that the defendant once held a weapon at a murder scenethat was not recovered is no basis from which to infer that the defendant acted to destroy or hide physical evidence of a crime.State v. Silva, 2007-NMCA-117, 142 N.M. 686, 168 P.3d 1110,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2008-NMSC-051, 144 N.M. 815, 192 P.3d 1192.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Convictions for both possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) and tampering with evidence (cocaine) did not violate defendant's double jeopardy rights.State v. Franco, 2005-NMSC-013, 137 N.M. 447, 112 P.3d 1104.\n\nSeparate convictions of tampering with evidence did not violate double jeopardy.— Where defendant shot the victim in the chest in defendant's vehicle, drove the unconscious victim in the vehicle to an isolated area, shot the victim twice in the head while the victim was still alive, poured gasoline on the victim, and lit the victim on fire; defendant gave the vehicle to a friend; and when the friend returned the vehicle, defendant set fire to the vehicle, defendant's three convictions of tampering with evidence were not based on unitary conduct and did not violate defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy.State v. Urioste, 2011-NMCA-121, 267 P.3d 820, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-012.\n\nPossession and tampering distinguished.— Possession of a controlled substance can be committed without tampering with evidence. Conversely, tampering with evidence, even if the evidence is illegal drugs, can be committed without possessing the drugs.State v. Franco, 2005-NMSC-013, 137 N.M. 447, 112 P.3d 1104.\n\nPossession of a controlled substance requires proof defendant knew or believed it was cocaine or some other substance that is regulated, which is not required to prove tampering, while tampering with evidence requires proof defendant intended to prevent the apprehension, prosecution, or conviction of herself or others, which is not required to prove possession. State v. Franco, 2005-NMSC-013, 137 N.M. 447, 112 P.3d 1104.\n\nRemoving documents from their proper filesamounts to \"hiding\" evidence prohibited by this section.State v. Casteneda, 1982-NMCA-046, 97 N.M. 670, 642 P.2d 1129.\n\nHiding evidence.— There was ample evidence of intent to tamper with evidence where directories crucial to the proof of the prosecution's case were removed from the defendant's offices to the office of someone not affiliated with defendant's association. In short, evidence relevant to a criminal prosecution for securities fraud was hidden for the purpose of avoiding the prosecution.State v. Shade, 1986-NMCA-072, 104 N.M. 710, 726 P.2d 864, cert. quashed, 104 N.M. 702, 726 P.2d 856,overruled on other grounds byState v. Olguin, 1994-NMCA-050, 118 N.M. 91, 879 P.2d 92,aff'd in part, 1995-NMSC-077, 120 N.M. 740, 906 P.2d 731.\n\nAccomplice liability.— One may be found guilty of tampering on a theory of accomplice liability in aiding the destruction of evidence.State v. Casteneda, 1982-NMCA-046, 97 N.M. 670, 642 P.2d 1129.\n\nIntent requirementscan be met regardless of whether a crime has in fact been committed and regardless of any belief or knowledge by the police concerning crimes or suspected crimes, or cause by the police to apprehend an individual.State v. Arellano, 1977-NMCA-126, 91 N.M. 195, 572 P.2d 223.\n\nSeries of acts.— The state presented sufficient evidence to support defendant's three separate convictions of tampering with evidence, given that defendant sent a note to three co-defendants in an attempt to cover up the crimes.State v. Reyes, 2002-NMSC-024, 132 N.M. 576, 52 P.3d 948.\n\nWhere defendant disposed of evidence at three distinct times in different locations, defendant's acts supported three convictions for tampering with evidence.State v. DeGraff, 2006-NMSC-011, 139 N.M. 211, 131 P.3d 61.\n\nSufficient evidence of tampering with evidence.— At defendant's trial for murder, kidnapping and tampering with evidence, where the state provided evidence establishing that defendant beat the victim with a baseball bat, mopped up the victim's blood and hid the bat behind a washing machine, there was sufficient evidence to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant intended to hide evidence from the police in order to avoid apprehension or prosecution.State v. Telles, 2019-NMCA-039, cert. denied.\n\nThere was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of tampering with evidence where the evidence established that defendant, while under the influence of methamphetamine and heroin, drove across a parking lot at a high rate of speed, struck two individuals in her path causing severe injuries, and fled the scene, and where defendant's interview with the police contained numerous admissions that she was driving the white vehicle in question, that she knew she struck at least one person with it, that she then left the parking lot without stopping to render assistance, and that she abandoned the vehicle at the end of a residential street about a half-mile away. The jury could have reasonably found defendant's movement to, and abandonment of her vehicle in, a residential area near the parking lot an overt act indicating her intent to evade prosecution.State v. Holtsoi, 2024-NMCA-042, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of attempted tampering with evidence.— At defendant's trial for murder, kidnapping and tampering with evidence, where the state provided evidence establishing that defendant beat the victim with a baseball bat, moved the victim's body to a back room and then rolled the body in a carpet, there was sufficient evidence to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant hid the body in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the police from discovering the victim.State v. Telles, 2019-NMCA-039, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where defendant lived with the victim for approximately one and a half months before the victim disappeared; a few weeks later, the victim's decomposed body was discovered wrapped in a blue air mattress and sheets, and covered with a mattress in an alley approximately 500 feet from defendant's apartment; defendant's parent testified that the parent sent a blue air mattress and a set of sheets to defendant; grid marks on the air mattress resembled the grid marks of a shopping cart; there was a shopping cart at the scene; shopping carts were found in defendant's apartment; DNA found on a pair of jeans near the body provided a possible link between the body and defendant; and the victims' blood was found on the carpet in defendant's apartment, the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find defendant guilty of tampering with evidence.State v. Schwartz, 2014-NMCA-066, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-006.\n\nWhere defendant drove a pickup toward a group of children who were trick-or-treating on Halloween; the chaperone pushed the children out of the way but was struck and killed; and after the accident, defendant removed decals on the truck and cleaned the front of the truck, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of tampering with evidence.State v. Melendrez, 2014-NMCA-062, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-006.\n\nWhere defendant testified that after defendant shot and killed the victim and then put the gun in a crawl space under the house; an officer testified that the gun was found in a crawl space under the house that was concealed behind a dog house where the dog was chained; and after defendant was arrested, defendant telephoned a person and asked the person to go under the house where the dog was because there was a water leak, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for tampering with evidence of a capital crime or a first or second degree felony.State v. Herrera, 2014-NMCA-007, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nWhere defendant directed an accomplice to remove stolen property from defendant's car; defendant saw the accomplice take the property from the car to another location; and defendant drove the car to defendant's parents' home for the purpose of disposing of the property, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for tampering with evidence under a theory of accomplice liability.State v. Johnson, 2004-NMSC-029, 136 N.M. 348, 98 P.3d 998, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1177, 125 S. Ct. 1334, 161 L. Ed. 2d 162 (2005).\n\nWhere, in a vehicular homicide case, the victim was carrying a twelve pack of a common brand of beer; defendant's vehicle hit the victim; defendant's friend discovered part of a twelve pack of the same brand of beer lodged in the damaged grille of defendant's car; and the police found beer cans near the victim's body, a partial twelve pack of the same brand of beer and damaged vehicle parts in a bag in defendant's home, and the friend's fingerprints on one of the cans of beer and on the grille of defendant's car, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for tampering with evidence.State v. Guzman, 2004-NMCA-097, 136 N.M. 253, 96 P.3d 1173, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-008, 136 N.M. 491, 100 P.3d 197.\n\nWhere, as defendant was approaching defendant's truck, police officers were converging on defendant to arrest defendant on a warrant; when defendant saw the police, defendant dropped bags of drugs behind the seat of the truck; and the officers discovered the drugs behind the seat of the truck, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for tampering with evidence.State v. Graham, 2003-NMCA-127, 134 N.M. 613, 81 P.3d 556,rev'd on other grounds, 2005-NMSC-004, 137 N.M. 197, 109 P.3d 285.\n\nWhere the non-conflicting testimony of witnesses established that while defendant was attending a party, defendant went to the victim's apartment to purchase marijuana and shot and killed the victim; defendant returned to the party with the gun in defendant's hand; defendant was showing off the gun at the party and stated that defendant had taken the gun from the victim and \"blasted\" the victim; defendant twice asked a person at the party to hide the gun; defendant tried unsuccessfully to sell the gun to two persons at the party; and the police were unable to find the gun, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of tampering with evidence.State v. Garcia, 2011-NMSC-003, 149 N.M. 185, 246 P.3d 1057.\n\nWhere the defendant fled the scene of a shooting with the weapons used in the crime; attempted to flee New Mexico; falsely identified himself to police officers; and concealed the weapons in his car, the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction of tampering with evidence.State v. Rudolfo, 2008-NMSC-036, 144 N.M. 305, 187 P.3d 170.\n\nWhere defendant's primary co-conspirator beat, drugged, and tied the victim to a bed in defendant's residence; defendant did not object to the treatment of the victim; while the primary co-conspirator was absent from the residence for a lengthy period of time, defendant watched the victim and did not assist the victim or call the police; defendant did not object when the primary co-conspirator expressed an intention to kill the victim and burn the victim's car; defendant purchased charcoal lighter fluid at the direction of the primary co-conspirator; defendant did not object when defendant's co-conspirators put the victim in the trunk of the victim's car; while defendant remained at the residence, defendant's co-conspirators used the lighter fluid to burn the car and kill the victim; and the following day, defendant washed the victim's blood splatter from the living room blinds, there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of tampering with evidence.State v. Bahney, 2012-NMCA-039, 274 P.3d 134, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-003.\n\nSufficient evidence of tampering with evidence.— Where defendant was charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of two victims, tampering with evidence and breaking and entering, there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction for tampering with evidence where the state presented testimony from a witness who saw defendant in the possession of a firearm just hours after the time when the murders were believed to have occurred, but did not have a gun when police stopped him soon thereafter. The jury could logically infer that defendant had a gun, which he disposed of between the time of the murders and when he was arrested, and then lied about it to police, and that defendant hid the gun to prevent apprehension, prosecution, or conviction of that crime.State v. Carrillo, 2017-NMSC-023.\n\nSufficient evidence to support tampering with evidence conviction.— Where defendant was charged with first-degree murder and tampering with evidence, and where several witnesses observed defendant shoot the victim while he was sitting in his vehicle, and where the police found the gun that fired the bullets that killed the victim and discharged the bullet casings found at the crime scene, the jury was free to infer that defendant discarded the gun after killing the victim and fleeing the scene. There was sufficient evidence presented to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant disposed of the gun to prevent apprehension, prosecution, or conviction.State v. Ramirez, 2018-NMSC-003.\n\nSufficient evidence to support a tampering conviction.— Where defendant's accomplices testified that the knife used to kill the victim belonged to defendant, and that after defendant learned that the victim had been killed, defendant let her accomplices into her house and allowed them to shower and change out of their bloody clothes, and that one of the accomplices cleaned the blood off of defendant's knife in defendant's restroom and in defendant's presence, and where there was evidence that the accomplice used bleach from defendant's home to clean the knife, the evidence was sufficient for a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended the destruction of evidence, including the removal of the victim's blood from her knife, in order to avoid being prosecuted for murder, and that defendant helped the accomplice clean the knife by providing the accomplice with space and chemicals to do so.State v. Montoya, 2016-NMCA-098, cert. denied.\n\nSubstantial evidence of tampering with evidence.— Where the defendant was bent down behind a fence; when police officers approached, the defendant stood up and walked toward a shed; the defendant did not stop when the officers called out to the defendant; the defendant's body movements appeared as if the defendant had disposed of something; the defendant then walked back to the officers; the officers found a bag of cocaine in front of the shed; and when the cocaine was found, the defendant placed the defendant's hands behind the defendant's back and turned around without any request by the officers, there was sufficient evidence to support a tampering with evidence conviction.State v. Delgado, 2009-NMCA-061, 146 N.M. 402, 210 P.3d 828, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-007, 148 N.M. 610, 241 P.3d 611.\n\nEvidence sufficient.— Where defendant shot multiple times into a house with two different weapons, killing one victim and wounding one victim; and defendant testified that immediately after the shooting, defendant took the guns and put them behind defendant's refrigerator, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of tampering with evidence.State v. Torrez, 2013-NMSC-034.\n\nEvidence sufficient to convict.— Testimony by a witness whom the factfinder has believed may be rejected by an appellate court only if there is a physical impossibility that the statements are true or the falsity of the statement is apparent without resort to inferences or deductions. Where testimony is not inherently improbable under this standard, it must be given weight, and have attached to it the credibility, apparently assigned it by the jury.State v. Sanders, 1994-NMSC-043, 117 N.M. 452, 872 P.2d 870.\n\nEvidence that defendant stated that he had killed someone and thrown the body in the trash along with evidence that the victim's nude body was found without identification, covered with plastic bags and duct tape, inside a dumpster was sufficient for conviction.State v. Rojo, 1999-NMSC-001, 126 N.M. 438, 971 P.2d 829.\n\nWhere defendant admitted that he assisted accomplice in throwing victim into a well and that he threw the stolen firearms into the woods, the jury could infer that he committed these acts to avoid apprehension, and this is sufficient evidence for the conviction of tampering with evidence.State v. Lopez, 2005-NMSC-036, 138 N.M. 521, 123 P.3d 754,overruled on other grounds byState v. Frawley, 2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\nSufficient evidence of intent.— Where defendant, charged with second-degree murder and tampering with evidence, testified that after he stabbed the victim, he threw the knife out the car window as he drove away from the crime scene, defendant's specific intent to prevent his apprehension or prosecution can be inferred from his overt act of disposing of the murder weapon; the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for tampering with evidence.State v. Sanchez, 2015-NMCA-077, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-006.\n\nNo fundamental error where state failed to prove an essential element of tampering with evidence when the evidence at trial clearly established the missing element.— Where defendant was charged with third-degree tampering with evidence of a second-degree felony, but where the jury instruction did not require the jury to find that defendant's act of tampering related to a second-degree felony, the failure to instruct the jury on one of the elements of the offense of third-degree tampering was error, offending defendant's sixth amendment right to a jury determination of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to every element of the crime charged; the error, however, did not amount to fundamental error as it was clear from the record that the evidence presented at trial established the missing element.State v. Sanchez, 2015-NMCA-077, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-006.\n\nSufficient evidence of tampering with evidence.— Where defendant was convicted of second-degree murder and tampering with evidence, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for tampering with evidence where the State sought to prove that defendant hid a vehicle connected to the shooting and that he intended to prevent the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of himself, and where the evidence at trial established that defendant drove the vehicle away from the shooting, left it parked in an alley and contacted an unidentified person who helped defendant obtain and pour gasoline on the vehicle and then start it on fire. Based on this evidence, the jury rationally could have inferred that defendant parked the car in the alley and returned to set it aflame and that his intent in doing so was to prevent his apprehension, prosecution, or conviction for the killing of the victim.State v. Chavez, 2022-NMCA-007, cert. granted.\n\nTampering with evidence conviction reversed where crime for which tampering with evidence was based was reversed.— Where defendant was convicted of second-degree murder and tampering with evidence in the third degree based on a finding that the highest degree for which tampering with evidence was committed was a second degree felony, and where the district court erred in denying defendant's proposed voluntary manslaughter instruction, thus requiring the reversal of defendant's second-degree murder conviction, defendant's tampering with evidence conviction also required reversal, because if the district court had correctly instructed the jury on voluntary manslaughter, the jury could have returned a guilty verdict on that charge, which is a third degree felony, and the jury's verdict would have amounted to a determination that defendant tampered with evidence of a third degree felony, and any conviction for tampering would have been a fourth degree felony.State v. Chavez, 2022-NMCA-007, cert. granted.\n\nEvidence insufficient to convict.— Where the state alleged that the defendant had a gun at the scene of the crime, a gun was used to murder the victim, the murder weapon was removed from the scene of the murder, and the murder weapon was never recovered, the state failed to meet its burden of proof because the state failed to offer direct evidence of the defendant's specific intent to tamper with evidence or evidence of an overt act from which the jury may infer such intent.State v. Silva, 2008-NMSC-051, 144 N.M. 815, 192 P.3d 1192.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of tampering with a gun that defendant had used to shoot into an occupied house; the state provided evidence that defendant took the gun when defendant left the crime scene; the State offered no evidence that defendant actively hid or disposed of the gun; the police recovered the gun from another person during a traffic stop a few weeks after the shooting; the state did not offer any evidence regarding how the other person acquired possession of the gun; and the only evidence that defendant tampered with the gun was that the police could not find the gun when they searched defendant's house, the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction.State v. Arrendondo, 2012-NMSC-013, 278 P.3d 517.\n\nSince defendant merely dropped some items from his hand to the ground upon the officers' announcement of police presence, there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of either element of intent or action under this section.State v. Roybal, 1992-NMCA-114, 115 N.M. 27, 846 P.2d 333, cert. denied, 114 N.M. 550, 844 P.2d 130.\n\nWhere there is no evidence suggesting that defendant encouraged his accomplice to dispose of the gun or was present when the accomplice threw it away, there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions for tampering with evidence and conspiracy to tamper with evidence.State v. Armijo, 2005-NMCA-010, 136 N.M. 723, 104 P.3d 1114.\n\nInsufficient evidence to support tampering with evidence conviction.— Where defendant was charged with trafficking a controlled substance, tampering with evidence, resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer, and possession of drug paraphernalia, and where defendant claimed there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for tampering with evidence based on the state's evidence that defendant threw baggies of crack cocaine into a vehicle in plain view of multiple officers following a traffic stop, defendant's conviction for tampering with evidence was not supported by sufficient evidence because the evidence was never concealed from officers, and New Mexico courts have drawn a distinction between acts occurring in the presence of an officer and those that attempted to conceal evidence outside the view of an officer.State v. Jackson, 2021-NMCA-059, cert. denied.\n\nInsufficient evidence.— Where the defendant, who was on probation, was required to submit to random urinalysis; the defendant provided a false urine sample; and there was no evidence that a violation of the criminal laws was being investigated or prosecuted by the probation officer, there was no evidence to support the defendant's conviction for tampering with evidence.State v. Jackson, 2009-NMCA-068, 146 N.M. 563, 212 P.3d 1117,rev'd, 2010-NMSC-032, 148 N.M. 452, 237 P.3d 754,overruled byState v. Radosevich, 2018-NMSC-028.\n\nWhere, in a case in which the victim died from multiple stab wounds, the only evidence presented by the state was that a knife or sharp object existed, that defendant's clothing might have been blood stained and that ten days passed between the murder and defendant's arrest, but there was no evidence of an overt act to destroy or hide any knife or blood stained clothing, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of intent by defendant to disrupt the police investigation or that defendant actively destroyed or hid evidence.State v. Duran, 2006-NMSC-035, 140 N.M. 94, 140 P.3d 515.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— Intentional spoliation of evidence, interfering with prospective civil action, as actionable, 70 A.L.R.4th 984.\n\nCriminal liability of attorney for tampering with evidence, 49 A.L.R. 5th 619.\n\nNegligent spoliation of evidence, interfering with prospective civil action, as actionable, 101 A.L.R.5th 61.",

      "text": "Escape from jail consists of any person who shall have been lawfully committed to any jail, escaping or attempting to escape from such jail.\n\nWhoever commits escape from jail is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-22-8, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 22-8.\n\nSection does not require commitment under criminal charge.— This section does not require commitment on a criminal charge. A literal reading of the statute would indicate that any person who has been committed to jail pursuant to lawful authority who escapes or attempts to escape is guilty of escape from jail.State v. Alderette, 1990-NMCA-132, 111 N.M. 297, 804 P.2d 1116.\n\nCommitment pursuant to arrest warrant.— Whether \"committed\" in this section means \"placing in confinement\" or \"an order of confinement,\" defendant held by virtue of an arrest warrant for a petty misdemeanor was \"committed\" to jail when he left the jail through the roof.State v. Garcia, 1968-NMCA-007, 78 N.M. 777, 438 P.2d 521.\n\nPhysical confinement not required.— Physical confinement in jail at the time a defendant escapes is not an element required for conviction under this section. \"Lawfully committed\", as used in this section, includes situations in which an inmate has been lawfully ordered to be confined in jail and thereafter is temporarily released on a furlough, but is legally obligated to return to jail at a specific time.State v. Hill, 1994-NMCA-069, 117 N.M. 807, 877 P.2d 1110, cert. denied, 118 N.M. 90, 879 P.2d 91.\n\nKitchen part of jail.— Evidence that kitchen was used for preparation of prisoners' meals and that it was part of the jail, supported guilty verdict which necessarily determined that the kitchen was an integral part and parcel of the jail and that the defendant had escaped therefrom.State v. Weaver, 1971-NMCA-172, 83 N.M. 362, 492 P.2d 144.\n\nEscape deemed from penitentiary, not jail.— Where the trial court had ordered the defendant released from the penitentiary into the custody of the county sheriff until after his arraignment, the order provided for a change in the location of his physical confinement but did not change the fact that the defendant's lawful custody or confinement was in the penitentiary, and the defendant was properly convicted of escape from the penitentiary under 30-22-9B NMSA 1978, rather than escape from jail under this section.State v. Martin, 1980-NMCA-019, 94 N.M. 251, 609 P.2d 333, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 628, 614 P.2d 545.\n\nEscape from work detail while serving jail sentence.— Where the defendant was assigned to a work detail at the county fairgrounds while serving a lawful sentence at a county jail, and it was while so assigned that he escaped, the defendant was guilty of escape from jail.State v. Gilman, 1981-NMCA-123, 97 N.M. 67, 636 P.2d 886, cert. denied, 97 N.M. 483, 641 P.2d 514;State v.

Martinez, 1998-NMCA-047, 125 N.M. 83, 957 P.2d 68, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 146, 958 P.2d 104.\n\nFundamental error to instruct the jury on escape from an inmate-release program when defendant was charged with escape from jail.— Where defendant was charged with escape from jail, and where, at trial, the district court judge instructed the jury using the uniform jury instruction that lists the essential elements for the crime of escape from an inmate-release program, defendant's conviction for escape from jail resulted in fundamental error, because the district court instructed the jury on a crime for which defendant was never charged. It is improper to instruct the jury as to a crime not formally charged if that crime is not a lesser-included offense of the crime formally charged.State v. Grubb, 2020-NMCA-003.\n\nSufficient evidence of escape from jail.— Where defendant was charged with escape from jail, and where at trial the state presented evidence that the district court revoked defendant's probation, sentenced him to two years and six months incarceration, and granted him furlough, and that defendant failed to report to the detention center at the end of the furlough period, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for escape from jail, because based on the evidence presented, the jury could reasonably conclude that defendant failed to return to lawful custody or confinement within the time fixed for his return and that his failure to return was done willfully.State v. Grubb, 2020-NMCA-003.\n\nInvalid conviction as defense.— So long as the commitment to custody is valid on its face, it is no defense to a charge of escaping jail that the incarceration was based on a violation of a law which was allegedly unconstitutionally applied.State v. Lopez, 1968-NMSC-098, 79 N.M. 235, 441 P.2d 764.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Grand Jury: True Tribunal of the People or Administrative Agency of the Prosecutor?\" see 2 N.M.L.

Escape from a community custody release program consists of a person, excluding a person on probation or parole, who has been lawfully committed to a judicially approved community custody release program, including a day reporting program, an electronic monitoring program, a day detention program or a community tracking program, escaping or attempting to escape from the community custody release program.\n\nB. Whoever commits escape from a community custody release program, when the person was committed to the program for a misdemeanor charge, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nC. Whoever commits escape from a community custody release program, when the person was committed to the program for a felony charge, is guilty of a felony.\n\nHistory:Laws 1999, ch. 118, § 1.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 1999, ch. 118, § 2, made the act effective on July 1, 1999.\n\nWillfulness is not an essential element of escape from a community custody release program.— Where, as a condition of release from jail during the course of a separate criminal proceeding, defendant was enrolled in a community custody release program, and where defendant, following an altercation with the custodian to whom defendant was released, fled the custodian's residence, and where defendant's community custody release program officer filed a criminal complaint charging defendant with escape from a community custody release program, and where, at trial, defendant argued that willfulness is an essential element of the crime of escape from a community custody release program and that the jury should be instructed accordingly, the district court did not err in denying defendant's requested instruction, because the plain language of NMSA 1978, § 30-22-8.1(A) indicates the legislature did not intend to include willfulness as an element of escape from a community custody release program.State v. Coble, 2023-NMCA-079, cert. denied.\n\nDefendant was not entitled to a duress instruction.— Where, as a condition of release from jail during the course of a separate criminal proceeding, defendant was enrolled in a community custody release program, and where defendant, following an altercation with the custodian to whom defendant was released, fled the custodian's residence, and where defendant's community custody release program officer filed a criminal complaint charging defendant with escape from a community custody release program, and where, at trial, defendant claimed that he was entitled to a duress instruction as an affirmative defense to escape from a community custody release program and that his trial counsel's failure to request such an instruction amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel or alternatively, the district court's failure to sua sponte instruct on duress amounted to fundamental error, the district court did not err in failing to sua sponte instruct the jury on duress and trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a duress instruction, because duress is a continuing offense, and there was no evidence that any claimed duress continued during the entire thirty-four day period while defendant remained voluntarily at large. Defendant, therefore, was not entitled to a duress instruction.State v. Coble, 2023-NMCA-079, cert. denied.\n\nElectronic monitoring programs.— Electronic monitoring programs may be used as part of a community custody release program: they are not limited to probation and parole programs.State v. Frost, 2003-NMCA-002, 133 N.M. 45, 60 P.3d 492, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 126, 61 P.3d 835.\n\nCommunity release programs.— A case by case release of defendants may be considered as a judicially approved community release program.State v. Duhon, 2005-NMCA-120, 138 N.M. 466, 122 P.3d 50, cert. quashed, 2006-NMCERT-003, 139 N.M. 352, 132 P.3d 1038.\n\nHabitual offender enhancement not prohibited.— Where defendant was convicted of felony possession of a controlled substance and subsequently committed to a community custody release program (CCP), and where two weeks after being committed to CCP, defendant cut off his ankle monitor and failed to respond to messages from monitoring officers, it was not error for the State to use Defendant's felony possession charge to determine whether to charge defendant for misdemeanor or felony escape from CCP and to use defendant's felony possession conviction to enhance his sentence for escape from CCP, because defendant's degree of escape from CCP was based upon the felony possession charge, while the enhancement of his felony escape sentence was based upon his three prior felony convictions.State v. Sanchez, 2019-NMCA-006, cert. denied.",

Martinez, 1989-NMCA-047, 109 N.M. 34, 781 P.2d 306, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 668, 777 P.2d 907.\n\nActual custody required.— In order to sustain a charge of escape under this section, a person who has been convicted and sentenced must first have undergone some moment of actual custody, either through an administrative booking or in-take processing with the department of corrections. Absent such custody, a person cannot be said to have committed escape from the penitentiary within the meaning of this section.State v. Pearson, 2000-NMCA-102, 129 N.M. 762, 13 P.3d 980.\n\nConviction not double jeopardy.— Assuming without deciding that some administrative sanctions had been levied against defendant for his escape from prison, conviction under this section did not constitute double jeopardy.State v. Budau, 1973-NMCA-151, 86 N.M. 21, 518 P.2d 1225, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 5, 518 P.2d 1209 (1974).\n\nApplication to honor farm constitutional.— Defendant's argument that application of this section to escapees from the prison honor farm constituted cruel and unusual punishment because of the difference in facilities at the farm compared with the state penitentiary was without merit.State v. Budau, 1973-NMCA-151, 86 N.M. 21, 518 P.2d 1225, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 5, 518 P.2d 1209 (1974).\n\nHonor farm part of penitentiary.— Prison honor farm was an integral part and parcel of the state penitentiary, and escape therefrom was an escape from the state penitentiary.State v. Budau, 1973-NMCA-151, 86 N.M. 21, 518 P.2d 1225, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 5, 518 P.2d 1209 (1974);State v. Peters, 1961-NMSC-160, 69 N.M. 302, 366 P.2d 148 (1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 831, 82 S. Ct. 849, 7 L. Ed. 2d 796 (1962).\n\nEscapee does not forfeit right of appeal.— A person convicted of a crime does not forfeit his right to appeal simply because he has escaped from confinement. He still has a right to have his conviction reversed if he was erroneously convicted or if his constitutional rights were violated.Mascarenas v. State, 1980-NMSC-074, 94 N.M. 506, 612 P.2d 1317.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the appeal, the escapee may still be criminally liable for the act of escape; therefore, there is no need to use the forfeiture of the constitutional right of appeal as a further sanction.Mascarenas v. State, 1980-NMSC-074, 94 N.M. 506, 612 P.2d 1317.\n\nCollateral attack of legality of commitment.— To collaterally attack the lawfulness of his commitment to the penitentiary prior to his escape, a defendant must come forward with substantive evidence to show that at the time of his escape he was illegally incarcerated.State v. Ellis, 1980-NMCA-187, 95 N.M. 427, 622 P.2d 1047, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 426, 622 P.2d 1046.\n\nEscape deemed from penitentiary, not jail.— Where the trial court had ordered the defendant released from the penitentiary into the custody of the county sheriff until after his arraignment, the order provided for a change in the location of his physical confinement but did not change the fact that the defendant's lawful custody or confinement was in the penitentiary, and the defendant was properly convicted of escape from the penitentiary under this section, rather than escape from jail under 30-22-8 NMSA 1978.State v. Martin, 1980-NMCA-019, 94 N.M. 251, 609 P.2d 333, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 628, 614 P.2d 545.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment on State v. Vaughn, 74 N.M. 365, 393 P.2d 711 (1964), and Sanders v.

This section applies only to those who are in the actual custody or control of a peace officer while under arrest, and cannot be extended to legal or \"constructive custody\" as well.State v. Trujillo, 1987-NMCA-141, 106 N.M. 616, 747 P.2d 262.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Combination of administrative punishment and judicial sentence following plea of guilty to escape from custody of peace officer (for escaping from penitentiary honor farm) did not amount to double jeopardy in violation of the state and federal constitutions.State v. Millican, 1972-NMSC-064, 84 N.M. 256, 501 P.2d 1076.\n\nEscape from lawful arrest.— Although marijuana discovered by officer should have been suppressed, because the search and seizure was the fruit of an illegal detention, nonetheless arrests by the officer, after smelling and seeing the marijuana, were in the lawful discharge of his duties and thus defendants' convictions for escape from custody were proper.State v. Bloom, 1976-NMCA-035, 90 N.M. 226, 561 P.2d 925,rev'd on other grounds, 1977-NMSC-016, 90 N.M. 192, 561 P.2d 465.\n\nDisposition of original charge immaterial.— Offense is committed if escape occurs after arrest for commission or alleged commission of a felony whether defendant is later found guilty of originally charged felony or not.State v.

Sivils, 2023-NMCA-080.\n\nContraband includes cocaine.— Subsection C(4) of Section 30-22-14 NMSA 1978 includes cocaine in its definition of \"contraband\".State v.

The defendant need not have known the peace officer's name, but only that the victim would be a peace officer.State v.

Moreover, the assault on a jail statute has guidelines prohibiting certain conduct, whether by persons incarcerated or not, and the decision to charge defendants with assault on a jail entailed no application of discretion, much less of an arbitrary nature.State v. AndersonandState v. Wilson, 2021-NMCA-031, cert. granted.\n\nDisorderly conduct and evading or obstructing an officer are not lesser included offenses of unlawful assault on a jail.— Where defendants were charged with unlawful assault on a jail based on evidence that they, and several other inmates, defied an order to lock down during a shift change of correction officers while incarcerated in the Otero county detention center, and where defendants claimed that the district court erred in denying their lesser included offense instructions of disorderly conduct and evading or obstructing an officer, the district court did not err in denying the requested instructions, because disorderly conduct and evading or obstructing an officer are not lesser included offenses of assault on a jail. Defendants' conduct did not occur in a public place as required by § 30-20-1(A) NMSA 1978, nor were their actions acts of violence capable of disturbing a community of the sort protected from such by § 30-22-19 NMSA 1978, and defendants' actions did not equate to an effort to avoid apprehension or arrest as contemplated by § 30-22-1(B) NMSA 1978.State v. AndersonandState v. Wilson, 2021-NMCA-031, cert. granted.\n\nSubstantial evidence of assault on a jail.— Where defendants were charged with unlawful assault on a jail based on evidence that they, and several other inmates, defied an order to lock down during a shift change of correction officers while incarcerated in the Otero county detention center, there was sufficient evidence to support defendants' convictions where the state presented video evidence that showed inmates' efforts to disobey the shift change lockdown order by misusing jail property to disable access into the pod by prison officials and law enforcement officers arriving to assist them, and the surveillance footage clearly depicted defendants participating in the conflict. Defendants' collective actions attacked the jail and imperiled the function and safety of the facility in a dangerous and destructive manner that satisfied the state's burden under § 30-22-19 NMSA 1978.State v.

Hamilton, 1988-NMCA-023, 107 N.M. 186, 754 P.2d 857, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 132, 753 P.2d 1320.\n\nIntent required to sustain convictionunder this section is that of conscious wrongdoing.Rutledge v. Fort, 1986-NMSC-017, 104 N.M. 7, 715 P.2d 455,overruled on other grounds byReese v. State, 1987-NMSC-079, 106 N.M. 498, 745 P.2d 1146.\n\nConscious wrongdoing required.— Conscious wrongdoing is an essential element of Paragraph (1) of Subsection A, and instructions in the language of the statute were insufficient to inform the jury of the intent required.State v. Cutnose, 1974-NMCA-130, 87 N.M. 307, 532 P.2d 896, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 299, 532 P.2d 888 (1975).\n\nSufficient evidence of aggravated assault on a peace officer based on a theory of accessory liability.— Where police officers attempted to execute a search of defendant's residence pursuant to a warrant, and where, as officers approached a camper on the property, the officers heard and saw gunfire coming from the camper, striking one of the officers, evidence that defendant owned the camper and was inside the camper at the time of the gunfire, and that DNA tests performed on several of the firearms retrieved from the camper found that defendant was either a major contributor of the DNA or could not be eliminated as a contributor, was sufficient for a reasonable jury to infer that defendant either shot at the officers himself, or, given the availability of firearms and ammunition inside his camper, defendant encouraged, helped, or caused others to shoot at the officers.State v. Uribe-Vidal, 2018-NMCA-008.\n\nDefendant's knowledge as to identity of peace officerassaulted is a necessary element of the crimes defined in this section and Section 30-22-24 NMSA 1978.State v. Nozie, 2009-NMSC-018, 146 N.M. 142, 207 P.3d 1119;Reese v. State, 1987-NMSC-110, 106 N.M. 505, 745 P.2d 1153.\n\nTo deny the defendant the right to have the jury informed as to his knowledge of the identity of police officer he assaulted would be to deny him the right to have the jury apprised of a necessary element of the crime for which he is charged, and that in turn would be to deny him his constitutional guarantee of due process of law,Reese v. State, 1987-NMSC-110, 106 N.M. 505, 745 P.2d 1153.\n\nOfficer's performance is essential element of crimebecause of the requirement that the jury be instructed that the officer must have been performing his duties and the restriction on fiddling with an elements instruction.State v. Rhea, 1979-NMCA-121, 93 N.M. 478, 601 P.2d 448.\n\nOmission of essential elements in jury instruction did not amount to fundamental error.— Where defendant was charged with aggravated assault on a police officer based on facts that he walked towards a police officer, who was in the lawful performance of his duties, with a knife and made a stabbing motion, and where, at trial, the given jury instruction erroneously failed to inform the jury that it was also required to find that defendant used a deadly weapon and that his conduct was unlawful, the omission did not rise to the level of fundamental error because an appellate court may affirm a conviction notwithstanding the absence of an implicit jury finding on an omitted element if the jury, having considered the parties' legal and factual presentations and having returned a guilty verdict on the given instructions, undoubtedly would have found the essential element if properly instructed, and the facts and circumstances of this case show that the jury implicitly found the missing elements in reaching its verdict. The jury explicitly found that defendant walked towards the officer with a large, sharp knife and made a stabbing motion, placing the officer in an objectively reasonable fear for his personal safety, amounting to a finding that defendant used the knife as a weapon, and undoubtedly would have found, if instructed properly, that the knife was capable of causing death or great bodily harm and that defendant acted unlawfully.State v. Ocon, 2021-NMCA-032, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence to support jury's verdict despite erroneous instruction.— Where defendant was charged with aggravated assault on a police officer based on facts that he walked towards a police officer, who was in the lawful performance of his duties, with a knife and made a stabbing motion, and where, at trial, the given jury instruction erroneously failed to inform the jury that it was also required to find that defendant used a deadly weapon and that his conduct was unlawful, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict where the jury was instructed that to convict defendant of aggravated assault upon a peace officer, it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant walked toward the officer with a knife and made a stabbing motion, defendant's conduct caused the officer to believe defendant was about to intrude on the officer's personal safety by touching or applying force to the officer in a rude, insolent or angry manner, that a reasonable person in the same circumstances as the officer would have the same belief, and that defendant used a knife, and where the state presented lapel camera video and still photos showing the knife laying on the kitchen floor, and established, through testimony of the officer, that defendant thrusted and slashed at the officer with a knife and reared back in a stabbing motion, placing the officer in fear for his life.State v. Ocon, 2021-NMCA-032, cert. denied.\n\nWhen officer in lawful discharge of duties.— Even if an officer makes an arrest without probable cause, the officer is performing official duties if the officer is acting in good faith and within the scope of what the officer is employed to do.State v. Tapia, 2000-NMCA-054, 129 N.M. 209, 4 P.3d 37, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 208, 4 P.3d 36.\n\nJury instruction on self-defense.— Where a police officer stopped defendant for failing to wear a seat belt; defendant became angry and grabbed defendant's driver's license from the officer; the officer drew a gun; defendant drove away; when the officer caught up with defendant, defendant approached the officer in an aggressive manner, cursing the officer; the officer sprayed defendant with pepper spray and drew the officer's gun; and defendant picked up a tire iron and approached the officer, the officer used reasonable force and defendant was not entitled to a self-defense instruction.State v. Ellis, 2008-NMSC-032, 144 N.M. 253, 186 P.3d 245,rev'g2007-NMCA-037, 141 N.M. 370, 155 P.3d 775.\n\nFailure to instruct reversible error.— The failure to instruct that the officer must have been performing his duties is the omission of an essential element, and this omission requires reversal of a conviction of aggravated assault upon a peace officer.State v. Rhea, 1979-NMCA-121, 93 N.M. 478, 601 P.2d 448.\n\nAssault with razor.— Testimony of police officers concerning incidents where defendant struck at officers with a straight razor was substantial evidence to support defendant's conviction for aggravated assault upon a peace officer.State v. Vallejos, 1974-NMCA-009, 86 N.M. 39, 519 P.2d 135.\n\nLesser included offense instruction on resisting arrest.— In a prosecution for aggravated assault on a peace officer, since there was evidence that resisting in violation of either Subsection B or D of 30-22-1 NMSA 1978 was the highest degree of crime committed, the defendant was entitled to a charge on the lesser offense.State v. Diaz, 1995-NMCA-137, 121 N.M. 28, 908 P.2d 258, cert. denied, 120 N.M. 828, 907 P.2d 1009.\n\nConviction of resisting, evading, or obstructing police officer.— The defendant was properly convicted of resisting, evading or obstructing an officer, because the evidence supported the verdict of the jury to that charge, and his opportunity to prepare and defend against the charge was not impaired by the fact that such an offense varied from the crime charged in the criminal information, i.e., aggravated assault upon a peace officer.State v. Hamilton, 1988-NMCA-023, 107 N.M. 186, 754 P.2d 857, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 132, 753 P.2d 1320.\n\nCollateral estoppel.— The state is collaterally estopped from attempting to prove in district court that the defendant was the driver of a car used in an assault when it has already tried and failed to prove this same issue in municipal court.Abramson v. Griffin, 693 F.2d 1009 (10th Cir. 1982).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Confusing Law of Criminal Intent in New Mexico,\" see 5 N.M.L.

Demongey, 2008-NMCA-066, 144 N.M. 333, 187 P.3d 679, cert. quashed, 2011-NMCERT-001, 150 N.M. 558, 263 P.3d 900.\n\nInsufficient evidence of assault with intent to commit a violent felony upon a peace officer.— Where, during a law enforcement officer's attempt to arrest defendant pursuant to a warrant, defendant first attempted to flee, and upon being tackled by the officer, defendant shot the officer in the leg and took off running, and where the officer testified at trial that prior to the shooting, it was very dark and it was very difficult for him to see because he did not have a flashlight and there was no outdoor lighting nearby, that once he was shot, defendant took off running, that he could not see defendant, that he did not know where defendant was, and that he figured defendant was going to try and kill him, there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for assault with intent to commit a violent felony upon a peace officer, because there was no evidence proving defendant's menacing conduct or an explicit or implied threat of further violence; the evidence presented merely allowed the jury to speculate, rather than infer, that defendant separately acted in a manner that caused the officer reasonable fear of an immediate battery after he was shot by defendant.State v. Baca, 2020-NMCA-049.\n\nStanding to challenge section's validity.— Where defendant was convicted of committing aggravated battery upon peace officer (30-22-25 NMSA 1978), a lesser included offense of this section, defendant's rights under this section were not at issue, despite the fact that it had been charged in the indictment, and he had no standing to challenge its constitutionality.State v. Bojorquez, 1975-NMCA-075, 88 N.M. 154, 538 P.2d 796, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nActs constituting one offense.— An assault arising from a series of three successive shots fired at a single victim, not separated by a significant amount of time, and arising from a single, continuous intent constituted one offense, and conviction of the defendant on two counts of assault violated his double jeopardy rights.State v. Handa, 1995-NMCA-042, 120 N.M. 38, 897 P.2d 225, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 771, 895 P.2d 671.\n\nLawful discharge of duties jury question.— Whether police officers were in the lawful discharge of their duties when they were shot by the defendant is a question for the jury to decide.State v.

Ford, 2007-NMCA-052, 141 N.M. 512, 157 P.3d 77, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-004, 141 N.M. 569, 158 P.3d 459.\n\nLawful discharge of duties.— An officer detaining a person without legal authority other than the bare fact of the officer's employment as a peace officer is not in the lawful discharge of the officer's duties.State v. Phillips, 2009-NMCA-021, 145 N.M. 615, 203 P.3d 146, cert. quashed, 2010-NMCERT-001, 147 N.M. 673, 227 P.3d 1055.\n\nThe statutory requirement that the victim have been a peace officer in the lawful discharge of the officer's duties has two components: (1) whether the officer was discharging the officer's duties and (2) whether the officer's discharge of the officer's duties was lawful.State v. Phillips, 2009-NMCA-021, 145 N.M. 615, 203 P.3d 146, cert. quashed, 2010-NMCERT-001, 147 N.M. 673, 227 P.3d 1055.\n\nWhere the defendant was intoxicated to the point that the defendant was stumbling and unable to keep his balance; the defendant admitted the defendant had been drinking and gave off a strong odor of alcohol; the officer did not believe there was probable cause to arrest the defendant for any crime; the officer was concerned that the defendant's intoxication made the defendant a threat to the defendant or to others the defendant might encounter; the officer placed the defendant in the officer's patrol car for the purpose of driving the defendant to the defendant's home; and the defendant became angry and punched the officer, the officer was acting in the lawful discharge of the officer's duties because the officer had probable cause to believe that the defendant was unable to care for himself and the officer was acting within the officer's actual authority under Section 43-2-2 NMSA 1978 of the Detoxification Reform Act to detain the defendant.State v. Phillips, 2009-NMCA-021, 145 N.M. 615, 203 P.3d 146, cert. quashed, 2010-NMCERT-001, 147 N.M. 673, 227 P.3d 1055.\n\nConstitutionality since act coupled with words.— Where a defendant coupled his rude, insolent, or angry remarks with force upon a police officer, the jury could properly find defendant guilty of battery upon a police officer. Thus the statute is not vague or overbroad.State v. Cruz, 1990-NMCA-103, 110 N.M. 780, 800 P.2d 214, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 749, 799 P.2d 1121.\n\nIntent required to sustain convictionunder this section is that of conscious wrongdoing.Rutledge v.

State, 1987-NMSC-079, 106 N.M. 498, 745 P.2d 1146.\n\nKnowledge that victim is peace officer.— Defendant's knowledge as to the identity of the peace officer assaulted is a necessary element of the crimes defined in 30-22-22 NMSA 1978 and this section.State v. Nozie, 2009-NMSC-018, 146 N.M. 142, 207 P.3d 1119;Reese v. State, 1987-NMSC-110, 106 N.M. 505, 745 P.2d 1153.\n\nTo deny the defendant the right to have the jury informed as to his knowledge of the identity of police officer he assaulted would be to deny him the right to have the jury apprised of a necessary element of the crime for which he is charged, and that in turn would be to deny him his constitutional guarantee of due process of law.Reese v. State, 1987-NMSC-110, 106 N.M. 505, 745 P.2d 1153.\n\nInstruction concerning knowledge.— An instruction regarding a defendant's knowledge that the victim is a peace officer is necessary only when defendant raises lack of such knowledge as a defense to the charge and there is evidence that the defendant acted without knowing that the victim was a peace officer.State v. Hilliard, 1988-NMCA-066, 107 N.M. 506, 760 P.2d 799, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 468, 760 P.2d 160.\n\nThis section and 30-22-17 NMSA 1978 relate to two different crimes.— Although it is possible for the same set of facts to fall within the ambit of this section and 30-22-17 NMSA 1978, relating to assault by a prisoner, they do not deal with the same crime, but with two different crimes.State v. Rhea, 1980-NMSC-033, 94 N.M. 168, 608 P.2d 144.\n\nRequirements for instruction on challenge to officer's authority.— Failure of the trial court to instruct jury that to convict defendant they had to find that her battery (slapping the detective's hand) posed an actual injury, actual threat to safety, or a meaningful challenge to authority was reversible error and mandated a new trial.State v. Cooper, 2000-NMCA-041, 129 N.M. 172, 3 P.3d 149.\n\nInstruction requiring proof of merely rude, insolent or angry behavior insufficient.— Subsection A includes as unlawful only those acts that physically injure officers, that actually harm officers by jeopardizing their safety, or that meaningfully challenge their authority; an instruction that the state must prove the defendant acted in a rude, insolent or angry manner clearly did not describe the element of harm to the safety or authority of the officers, and was fundamental error.State v. Padilla, 1997-NMSC-022, 123 N.M. 216, 937 P.2d 492.\n\nFinding by prison disciplinary committee was not a conviction under the statute.— Where defendant, who was serving a prison sentence, had an altercation with a prison guard; the guard filed a misconduct report; and a prison disciplinary committee found defendant \"guilty of a Major Report of Charge, NMSA 30-22-24, Battery Upon a Police Officer\", the fact that the conduct at issue in the hearing is also defined as a criminal offense did not mean that the disciplinary committee charged and convicted defendant under the criminal felony law.Ramer v. Kerby, 936 F.2d 1102 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\nJailers as peace officers.— Legislature did not exclude jailers from definition of peace officers: a jailer is an officer in the public domain, charged with the duty to maintain public order.State v. Rhea, 1980-NMSC-033, 94 N.M. 168, 608 P.2d 144.\n\nCorrectional officer is \"peace officer\".— The legislature has amended the correctional officers statute to provide that crimes against correctional officers and employees of the Corrections Department acting as peace officers were deemed crimes against peace officers.State v. Gutierrez, 1993-NMCA-058, 115 N.M. 551, 854 P.2d 878, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 545, 854 P.2d 872.\n\nA public service officer is not a \"peace officer\".— Where defendant was charged with felony battery upon a peace officer after he hit the forearm of a public service officer (PSO) performing her duties under the Detoxication Reform Act (DRA), §§ 43-2-1.1 through 43-2-23 NMSA 1978, by escorting defendant to her vehicle to place him into protective custody, and where defendant filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that the evidence presented was insufficient to support defendant's charge of felony battery upon a peace officer because a PSO is not a \"peace officer\" as a matter of law, the district court did not err in reducing defendant's criminal charge from felony battery upon a peace officer to petty misdemeanor battery, because PSOs are not vested with a duty to maintain public order or to make arrests and therefore are not peace officers.State v. Becenti, 2021-NMCA-060.\n\nSufficient evidence to find that the victim was a peace officer.— In defendant's trial for battery on a peace officer, the victim's testimony that he was a corrections officer employed by the metropolitan detention center was substantial evidence that he was a peace officer under this statute.State v. Salas, 2017-NMCA-057, cert. denied.\n\nJuvenile correctional officer is peace officerfor purposes of the battery on a peace officer statute, despite the fact that JCOs are no longer under the control of the New Mexico Corrections Department.State v. Gutierrez, 1993-NMCA-058, 115 N.M. 551, 854 P.2d 878, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 545, 854 P.2d 872.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— The jurisdictional exception to double jeopardy permitted defendant's prosecution in the district court on a charge of peace officer battery, after he had pleaded guilty to several misdemeanors, including resisting arrest, in the magistrate court.State v. Padilla, 1984-NMSC-026, 101 N.M. 58, 678 P.2d 686,aff'dsub nom., Fugate v. New Mexico, 470 U.S. 904, 105 S. Ct. 1858, 84 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1985).\n\nOfficers acting in good faith.— Even if an arrest was illegal, the courts cannot condone the use of force in resisting every subsequent act made in good faith by a law enforcement officer, as police officers acting in good faith, although mistakenly, should be relieved of the threat of physical harm.State v. Doe, 1978-NMSC-072, 92 N.M. 100, 583 P.2d 464.\n\nTest is whether officer engaged in performance of official duties.— Even if an arrest is effected without probable cause, a police officer is engaged in the performance of his official duties and therefore protected under this section if he is simply acting within the scope of what he is employed to do; the test is whether he is acting within that compass or is engaging in a personal frolic of his own.State v. Doe, 1978-NMSC-072, 92 N.M. 100, 583 P.2d 464.\n\nWhen officer in lawful discharge of duties.— An officer is in the lawful discharge of his duties if he is acting within the scope of what he is employed to do.State v. Gonzales, 1982-NMCA-043, 97 N.M. 607, 642 P.2d 210.\n\nIf there is evidence that a peace officer used excessive force, there is a factual issue for the jury as to whether the officer acted within the scope of what he was employed to do and, thus, a factual issue as to whether the officer was performing his duties.State v. Gonzales, 1982-NMCA-043, 97 N.M. 607, 642 P.2d 210.\n\nScope of contact with person.— The jury was properly instructed that it could find defendant guilty of battery under this section if it found that defendant knocked or took a flashlight out of the arresting officer's hand. The word \"person\" as used in this statute includes anything intimately connected with a person.State v. Ortega, 1992-NMCA-003, 113 N.M. 437, 827 P.2d 152.\n\nIncluded offense.— Battery upon a peace officer is included within the charge of aggravated battery upon a peace officer, and thus defendant's conviction was for an offense included within charge of which he had notice.State v. Kraul, 1977-NMCA-032, 90 N.M. 314, 563 P.2d 108, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nLesser included offense.— Where defendant admitted to intentionally kicking a police officer to avoid being shot, he was not entitled to an instruction on resisting, obstructing or evading a police officer as a lesser included offense of battery on a peace officer.State v. Hill, 2001-NMCA-094, 131 N.M. 195, 34 P.3d 139.\n\nVerbatim instruction not required.— In a prosecution for battery upon a police officer, the trial court did not commit error in refusing defendant's requested jury instruction seeking the use of the words \"lawful discharge of his duties\" instead of \"performing the duties of a peace officer.\"State v. Nemeth, 2001-NMCA-029, 130 N.M. 261, 23 P.3d 936,overruled on other grounds byState v. Ryon, 2005-NMSC-005, 137 N.M. 174, 108 P.3d 1032.\n\nInstruction on simple battery warranted.— One cannot batter a peace officer while in the lawful discharge of his duties without battering the person of another, and there being evidence that the police officer was not in the lawful discharge of his duties in connection with the altercation, the trial court erred in refusing to instruct on simple battery as well as on battery on an officer.State v. Kraul, 1977-NMCA-032, 90 N.M. 314, 563 P.2d 108, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nIf there is a factual issue as to performance of duties, the defendant is entitled to an instruction on simple battery as a lesser included offense to battery upon a police officer.State v. Gonzales, 1982-NMCA-043, 97 N.M. 607, 642 P.2d 210.\n\nInstruction on right to detain.— There was no error in refusing a requested instruction on an officer's right to detain a person which focused only on the officer's initial approach to defendant and disregarded the officer's attempt to arrest after defendant allegedly hit the officer, since in light of the evidence, the requested instruction was incomplete and would have confused the jury on the issue of lawful discharge of duties.State v. Kraul, 1977-NMCA-032, 90 N.M. 314, 563 P.2d 108, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.\n\nWhen charge barred by acquittal on other charges.— After a magistrate's determination that the defendant was not guilty of resisting and obstructing an officer and disorderly conduct because he was acting in defense of another, the state cannot charge him with battery on a police officer and constitutionally bring him before a new fact finder to relitigate that same factual issue.State v. Orosco, 1982-NMCA-181, 99 N.M. 180, 655 P.2d 1024.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where police officers were attempting to arrest defendant's relative, defendant aggressively approached the officers by raising defendant's fists, shouting and coming close to the officers, and while one officer attempted to handcuff defendant, defendant kicked the officer in the leg, injuring the officer, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for battery on a peace officer.State v. Ford, 2007-NMCA-052, 141 N.M. 512, 157 P.3d 77, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-004, 141 N.M. 569, 158 P.3d 459.\n\nConviction supported by evidence.— Testimony of police officer that he and defendant exchanged blows was sufficient evidence of intentional touching to support defendant's conviction for battery under this section, notwithstanding the officer's concession on cross-examination that he couldn't actually remember whether defendant had hit him.State v. Ortega, 1992-NMCA-003, 113 N.M. 437, 827 P.2d 152.\n\nSpitting or throwing urine upon a peace officercould reasonably be found by a jury to come within the purview of battery upon a peace officer.State v. Jones, 2000-NMCA-047, 129 N.M. 165, 3 P.3d 142, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 207, 4 P.3d 35 .\n\nEvidence sufficientto sustain defendant's conviction where he spit on and kicked an officer while being restrained.State v. Martinez, 2002-NMCA-036, 131 N.M. 746, 42 P.3d 851, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 737, 42 P.3d 842.\n\nDefense of another against excessive police force is a viable defense.— The right to defense of another against a police officer is not absolute; it does not exist if the officer is using necessary force to effect an arrest. However, a defendant is entitled to a defense of another jury instruction if an officer used force against another that was unreasonable and unnecessary.State v. Jones, 2020-NMCA-029.\n\nWhere defendant was charged with battery upon a peace officer and resisting or abusing an officer, and where defendant requested a defense of another jury instruction, the district court erred in denying the request and in finding that defending another against excessive force by a police officer was not a viable defense, because defense of another against excessive police force is a viable defense and reasonable minds could differ as to whether the officers used excessive force in this case.State v. Jones, 2020-NMCA-029.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Confusing Law of Criminal Intent in New Mexico,\" see 5 N.M.L.

Aggravated battery upon a peace officer consists of the unlawful touching or application of force to the person of a peace officer with intent to injure that peace officer while he is in the lawful discharge of his duties.\n\nB. Whoever commits aggravated battery upon a peace officer, inflicting an injury to the peace officer which is not likely to cause death or great bodily harm, but does cause painful temporary disfigurement or temporary loss or impairment of the functions of any member or organ of the body, is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nC. Whoever commits aggravated battery upon a peace officer, inflicting great bodily harm, or does so with a deadly weapon or in any manner whereby great bodily harm or death can be inflicted, is guilty of a third degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-22-24, enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 265, § 5.\n\nCross references.— For definitions of deadly weapon and great bodily harm,see30-1-12 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor aggravated battery,see30-3-5 NMSA 1978.\n\nKnowledge of the victim's identity as a peace officer.— Knowledge of the victim's identity as a peace officer is an essential element of the crime of aggravated battery upon a peace officer, which the state has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Nozie, 2009-NMSC-018, 146 N.M. 142, 207 P.3d 1119,aff'g2007-NMCA-131, 142 N.M. 626, 168 P.3d 756.\n\nSufficient evidence of aggravated battery on a peace officer based on a theory of accessory liability.— Where police officers attempted to execute a search of defendant's residence pursuant to a warrant, and where, as officers approached a camper on the property, the officers heard and saw gunfire coming from the camper, striking one of the officers, evidence that defendant owned the camper and was inside the camper at the time of the gunfire, and that DNA tests performed on several of the firearms retrieved from the camper found that defendant was either a major contributor of the DNA or could not be eliminated as a contributor, was sufficient for a reasonable jury to infer that defendant either shot at the officers himself, or, given the availability of firearms and ammunition inside his camper, defendant encouraged, helped, or caused others to shoot at the officers.State v. Uribe-Vidal, 2018-NMCA-008.\n\nConvictions of aggravated battery upon a peace officer and attempted first degree murder violated double jeopardy.— Where defendant, who was imprisoned in a county detention center, attacked and stabbed a correctional officer five times with a metal shank, defendant's convictions for attempted murder and aggravated battery of a peace officer did not violate double jeopardy.State v. Urquizo, 2012-NMCA-113, 288 P.3d 919, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-011.\n\nAlthough the defendant's mental state, rather than the victim's conduct, is the touchstone of the defendant's knowledge that the victim is a peace officer,the defendant's intent to commit aggravated battery on a peace officer may be established by circumstantial evidence, which may include the fact that the victim was in full uniform, had a badge visibly displayed, was driving a marked police vehicle, or had identified himself or herself as a police officer.State v. Nozie, 2009-NMSC-018, 146 N.M. 142, 207 P.3d 1119,aff'g2007-NMCA-131, 142 N.M. 626, 168 P.3d 756.\n\nBattery under Section 30-3-4 NMSA 1978 is a lesser included offense of aggravated battery upon a peace officer.State v.

Flores, 2005-NMCA-135, 138 N.M. 636, 124 P.3d 1175, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-011, 138 N.M. 636, 124 P.3d 564.\n\nLesser offense.— The offense of aggravated battery upon a peace officer is a lesser included offense of the crime of assault with intent to commit a violent felony upon a peace officer (30-22-23 NMSA 1978).State v. Bojorquez, 1975-NMCA-075, 88 N.M. 154, 538 P.2d 796, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nBattery upon officer included.— Battery upon a peace officer is a charge included within the charge of aggravated battery upon a peace officer, and thus defendant's conviction was for an offense included within the charge of aggravated battery of an officer of which he had notice.State v. Kraul, 1977-NMCA-032, 90 N.M. 314, 563 P.2d 108, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486.",

Disarming a peace officer consists of knowingly:\n\n(1) removing a firearm or weapon from the person of a peace officer when the officer is acting within the scope of his duties; or\n\n(2) depriving a peace officer of the use of a firearm or weapon when the officer is acting within the scope of his duties.\n\nB. The provisions of Subsection A of this act shall not apply when a peace officer is engaged in criminal conduct.\n\nC. Whoever commits disarming a peace officer is guilty of a third degree felony.\n\nHistory:Laws 1997, ch. 122, § 1.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 1997, ch. 122, § 2 makes the act effective July 1, 1997.\n\n\"Use of a firearm\" defined.— The plain language of the statute penalizes a defendant for depriving an officer of the use of a firearm at any point during the officer's acting within the scope of his duties, rather than limiting its applicability to a deprivation that occurs only when the officer is attempting or intends an immediate use of the firearm.State v. Ortiz, 2017-NMCA-006, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of attempt to disarm a peace officer.— Where a law enforcement officer, in response to a report of a male subject acting suspiciously, detained and transported defendant to the police department due to his bizarre behavior, and where defendant began hitting his head against the wall and door of the holding cell requiring medical attention, and while being transported to the hospital, defendant grabbed the officer's shotgun from the front seat of the patrol vehicle with both hands, despite being handcuffed, and tried to pull the weapon from the front seat to the back seat of the patrol car, the evidence produced at trial was sufficient for the district court to conclude that defendant intentionally grabbed the shotgun intending to pull it through the partition between the front and back seat of the patrol vehicle, and that doing so would deprive the officer, who was acting within the scope of his duties, of its use.State v. Ortiz, 2017-NMCA-006, cert. denied.",
