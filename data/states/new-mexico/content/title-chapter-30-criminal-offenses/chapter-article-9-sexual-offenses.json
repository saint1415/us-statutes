      "text": "As used in Sections 30-9-10 through 30-9-16 NMSA 1978:\n\nA. \"force or coercion\" means:\n\n(1) the use of physical force or physical violence;\n\n(2) the use of threats to use physical violence or physical force against the victim or another when the victim believes that there is a present ability to execute the threats;\n\n(3) the use of threats, including threats of physical punishment, kidnapping, extortion or retaliation directed against the victim or another when the victim believes that there is an ability to execute the threats;\n\n(4) the perpetration of criminal sexual penetration or criminal sexual contact when the perpetrator knows or has reason to know that the victim is unconscious, asleep or otherwise physically helpless or suffers from a mental condition that renders the victim incapable of understanding the nature or consequences of the act; or\n\n(5) the perpetration of criminal sexual penetration or criminal sexual contact by a psychotherapist on his patient, with or without the patient's consent, during the course of psychotherapy or within a period of one year following the termination of psychotherapy.\n\nPhysical or verbal resistance of the victim is not an element of force or coercion;\n\nB. \"great mental anguish\" means psychological or emotional damage that requires psychiatric or psychological treatment or care, either on an inpatient or outpatient basis, and is characterized by extreme behavioral change or severe physical symptoms;\n\nC. \"patient\" means a person who seeks or obtains psychotherapy;\n\nD. \"personal injury\" means bodily injury to a lesser degree than great bodily harm and includes, but is not limited to, disfigurement, mental anguish, chronic or recurrent pain, pregnancy or disease or injury to a sexual or reproductive organ;\n\nE. \"position of authority\" means that position occupied by a parent, relative, household member, teacher, employer or other person who, by reason of that position, is able to exercise undue influence over a child;\n\nF. \"psychotherapist\" means a person who is or purports to be a:\n\n(1) licensed physician who practices psychotherapy;\n\n(2) licensed psychologist;\n\n(3) licensed social worker;\n\n(4) licensed nurse;\n\n(5) counselor;\n\n(6) substance abuse counselor;\n\n(7) psychiatric technician;\n\n(8) mental health worker;\n\n(9) marriage and family therapist;\n\n(10) hypnotherapist; or\n\n(11) minister, priest, rabbi or other similar functionary of a religious organization acting in his role as a pastoral counselor;\n\nG. \"psychotherapy\" means professional treatment or assessment of a mental or an emotional illness, symptom or condition;\n\nH. \"school\" means any public or private school, including the New Mexico military institute, the New Mexico school for the blind and visually impaired, the New Mexico school for the deaf, the New Mexico boys' school, the New Mexico youth diagnostic and development center, the Los Lunas medical center, the Fort Stanton hospital, the New Mexico behavioral health institute at Las Vegas and the Carrie Tingley crippled children's hospital, that offers a program of instruction designed to educate a person in a particular place, manner and subject area. \"School\" does not include a college or university; and\n\nI. \"spouse\" means a legal husband or wife, unless the couple is living apart or either husband or wife has filed for separate maintenance or divorce.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-9-20, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 109, § 1; 1979, ch. 28, § 1; 1993, ch. 177, § 1; 2001, ch. 161, § 1; 2005, ch. 313, § 7.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, changed the name of the New Mexico school for the visually handicapped to the New Mexico school for the blind and visually impaired and changed the name of the Las Vegas medical center to the New Mexico behavioral institute at Las Vegas in Subsection H.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, added Subsection H and redesignated former Subsection H as Subsection I.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, in Subsection A, substituted \"contact\" for \"conduct\" near the beginning of Paragraph (4), redesignated the former second sentence of Paragraph (4) as the second undesignated paragraph of the subsection, added Paragraph (5), making a related grammatical change, and made stylistic changes; and added present Subsections C, F, and G, making related subsection redesignations.\n\nForce or coercion.Where defendant grabbed the victim's breasts, causing pain and discomfort and squeezed the victim's breasts so tightly that the victim was unable to breath, became dizzy, and was unable to escape from defendant's grip, there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant used force to sexually assault the victim.State v. Huff, 1998-NMCA-075, 125 N.M. 254, 960 P.2d 342, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 146, 958 P.2d 104.\n\nMental anguish.Expert testimony concerning the victim's mood swings from depression to anger, the victim's emotional inability to re-enroll in school, indications that the victim had started drinking more to block out what happened, and the victim's plan to move in order to avoid bad memories and embarrassment was sufficient evidence to establish the element of mental anguish.State v. Barraza, 1990-NMCA-026, 110 N.M. 45, 791 P.2d 799, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 704, 789 P.2d 1271.\n\nSufficient evidence of great mental anguish.— Where defendant was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual penetration (CSP), and where defendant claimed that the state failed to establish that the victim suffered great mental anguish as a result of the incident and that the evidence is therefore insufficient to support his conviction for first-degree CSP, evidence that the victim was over seventy years of age, that she moved to another state to live with her daughter because she felt unable to live alone, that she experienced constant flashbacks, and as a result had trouble concentrating and was unable to drive for a period of time, was sufficient to support a conclusion that the victim suffered great mental anguish as a result of the incident.State v. Sena, 2018-NMCA-037,rev'd in part by2020-NMSC-011.\n\nPosition of authority.Where defendant was considered by the victim as a father figure; defendant acted as a father figure in the presence of other people; defendant did chores at the request of the victim's parent; defendant was entrusted by the victim's parent to act as the victim's guardian at times; defendant assumed the role of employer by allowing the victim to earn money at defendant's place of business; and defendant was the trusted friend of the victim's parent which allowed defendant to be alone with the victim when the victim spent the night at defendant's house or went to the dump in defendant's truck, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that defendant exercised a position of authority over the victim.State v. Gipson, 2009-NMCA-053, 146 N.M. 202, 207 P.3d 1179.\n\n\"Position of authority\" interpreted.— In 30-9-10(E) NMSA 1978, the legislature has designated certain relationships with a child that represent a \"position of authority,\" and the language \"who, by reason of that position, is able to exercise undue influence over a child\" does not pertain to each of the types of position of authority listed in the definition. Under the definition of \"position of authority\", a household member is presumed to be able to exercise undue influence over a child such that additional proof concerning a perpetrator's use or possession of such authority is not required.State v. Erwin, 2016-NMCA-032, cert. denied.\n\nWhere defendant, who was charged with criminal sexual contact of a child thirteen to eighteen years of age, did not dispute the evidence that he was a household member, but claimed that the state failed to prove that he used this position of authority to coerce the child to submit to sexual contact, the state was not required to prove that defendant, by reason of his position as a household member, was able to exercise undue influence over the child, because the legislature has designated certain relationships with a child, including a household member, that represent a position of authority for purposes of prosecution under 30-9-13 NMSA 1978.State v. Erwin, 2016-NMCA-032, cert. denied.\n\nPhrase \"unless the couple is living apart\"is not void for vagueness when construed and applied in the ordinary sense to mean a suspension of the marital relationship.State v. Brecheisen, 1984-NMCA-011, 101 N.M. 38, 677 P.2d 1074, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 11, 677 P.2d 624.\n\nEvidence of living apart.— Evidence supported finding that defendant and his wife were living apart at the time of an alleged attack by defendant upon his wife, where the wife testified that she felt she was living apart from defendant at the time of the attack, and there was evidence of the couple's physical separation and the defendant's securing other housing and paying one month's rent.Brecheisen v. Mondragon, 833 F.2d 238 (10th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1011, 108 S. Ct. 1479, 99 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1988).\n\nConsensual sex between therapist and adult patient.— A defendant's conduct did not constitute the crimes of second or third degree criminal sexual penetration because consensual sex between a therapist and his adult patient is not a crime.State v. Leiding, 1991-NMCA-043, 112 N.M. 143, 812 P.2d 797, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 77, 811 P.2d 575.\n\nLaw reviews.— For symposium, \"The Impact of the Equal Rights Amendment on the New Mexico Criminal Code,\" see 3 N.M.L. Rev. 106 (1973).\n\nFor article, New Mexico Joins the Twentieth Century: The Repeal of the Marital Rape Exemption, see 22 N.M.L. Rev. 551 (1992).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— Rape or similar offense based on intercourse with woman who is allegedly mentally deficient, 31 A.L.R.3d 1227.\n\nCriminal responsibility for physical measures undertaken in connection with treatment of mentally disordered patient, 99 A.L.R.3d 854.\n\nNecessity or permissibility of mental examination to determine competency or credibility of complainant in sexual offense prosecution, 45 A.L.R.4th 310.\n\nConviction of rape or related sexual offenses on basis of intercourse accomplished under the pretext of, or in the course of, medical treatment, 65 A.L.R.4th 1064.",

      "text": "A. Criminal sexual penetration is the unlawful and intentional causing of a person to engage in sexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio or anal intercourse or the causing of penetration, to any extent and with any object, of the genital or anal openings of another, whether or not there is any emission.\n\nB. Criminal sexual penetration does not include medically indicated procedures.\n\nC. Aggravated criminal sexual penetration consists of all criminal sexual penetration perpetrated on a child under thirteen years of age with an intent to kill or with a depraved mind regardless of human life. Whoever commits aggravated criminal sexual penetration is guilty of a first degree felony for aggravated criminal sexual penetration.\n\nD. Criminal sexual penetration in the first degree consists of all criminal sexual penetration perpetrated:\n\n(1) on a child under thirteen years of age; or\n\n(2) by the use of force or coercion that results in great bodily harm or great mental anguish to the victim.\n\nWhoever commits criminal sexual penetration in the first degree is guilty of a first degree felony.\n\nE. Criminal sexual penetration in the second degree consists of all criminal sexual penetration perpetrated:\n\n(1) by the use of force or coercion on a child thirteen to eighteen years of age;\n\n(2) on an inmate confined in a correctional facility or jail when the perpetrator is in a position of authority over the inmate;\n\n(3) by the use of force or coercion that results in personal injury to the victim;\n\n(4) by the use of force or coercion when the perpetrator is aided or abetted by one or more persons;\n\n(5) in the commission of any other felony; or\n\n(6) when the perpetrator is armed with a deadly weapon.\n\nWhoever commits criminal sexual penetration in the second degree is guilty of a second degree felony. Whoever commits criminal sexual penetration in the second degree when the victim is a child who is thirteen to eighteen years of age is guilty of a second degree felony for a sexual offense against a child and, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978, shall be sentenced to a minimum term of imprisonment of three years, which shall not be suspended or deferred. The imposition of a minimum, mandatory term of imprisonment pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall not be interpreted to preclude the imposition of sentencing enhancements pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Sentencing Act [Chapter 31, Article 18 NMSA 1978].\n\nF. Criminal sexual penetration in the third degree consists of all criminal sexual penetration perpetrated through the use of force or coercion not otherwise specified in this section.\n\nWhoever commits criminal sexual penetration in the third degree is guilty of a third degree felony.\n\nG. Criminal sexual penetration in the fourth degree consists of all criminal sexual penetration:\n\n(1) not defined in Subsections D through F of this section perpetrated on a child thirteen to sixteen years of age when the perpetrator is at least eighteen years of age and is at least four years older than the child and not the spouse of that child; or\n\n(2) perpetrated on a child thirteen to eighteen years of age when the perpetrator, who is a licensed school employee, an unlicensed school employee, a school contract employee, a school health service provider or a school volunteer, and who is at least eighteen years of age and is at least four years older than the child and not the spouse of that child, learns while performing services in or for a school that the child is a student in a school.\n\nWhoever commits criminal sexual penetration in the fourth degree is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-9-21, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 109, § 2; 1987, ch. 203, § 1; 1991, ch. 26, § 1; 1993, ch. 177, § 2; 1995, ch. 159, § 1; 2001, ch. 161, § 2; 2003 (1st S.S.), ch. 1, § 3; 2007, ch. 69, § 1; 2009, ch. 56, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For assault with intent to commit a violent felony,see30-3-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor sexual exploitation of children,see30-6A-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor provision that testimony of a victim hereunder need not be corroborated,see30-9-15 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor limitations on testimony regarding victim's past sexual conduct,see30-9-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act,seeChapter 29, Article 11A NMSA 1978.\n\nFor Uniform Jury Instructions,seeUJI 14-941 to 14-963 NMRA.\n\nCompiler's notes.— For Laws 2003, ch. 257 enactment concerning time limit for prosecution under this section,see30-1-9.2 NMSA 1978 and notes thereto.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection C, increased the age of the child victim from nine to thirteen years.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective July 1, 2007, added a new Subsection C to provide a penalty for aggravated criminal sexual penetration in the first degree; defined criminal sexual penetration in the second degree to consist of criminal sexual penetration by the use of force or coercion on a child thirteen to eighteen years of age; and eliminated the penalty for criminal sexual penetration in the third degree when the victim is thirteen to eighteen years of age.\n\nThe 2003 (1st S.S.) amendment,effective February 3, 2004, added the last two sentences of Subsection D and the last sentence of Subsection E.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, substituted \"eighteen\" for \"sixteen\" in Paragraph D(1); and in Subsection F, added the Paragraph (1) designation, inserted \"the child\" following \"older than\" in Paragraph (1), and added Paragraph (2).\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, in Subsection D, added Paragraph (2) and redesignated the remaining paragraphs accordingly.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, designated the formerly undesignated provisions as Subsection A; added present Subsection B; redesignated former Subsections A through D as Subsections C through F; and substituted \"Subsections C through E\" for \"Subsection A, B, or C\" in the first paragraph of Subsection F.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, deleted \"other than one's spouse\" following \"person\" in the first paragraph and substituted \"and not the spouse of that child\" for \"the child\" at the end of the first sentence in Subsection D.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, added Subsection D.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nConstitutionality.— \"Unlawful\" is defined as \"without excuse of justification\" and the use of that term by the statute does not render the statute void for vagueness.State v. Larson, 1980-NMSC-106, 94 N.M. 795, 617 P.2d 1310.\n\nIdentical counts and jury instructions.— Where multiple counts of criminal sexual penetration of a minor in the indictment and the counts in the jury instructions were carbon-copy counts of each other and where the child's testimony distinguished facts for each count and the defendant admitted to having sexual intercourse with the child on several occasions, there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could find separate incidents of criminal sexual penetration and there was no violation of double jeopardy.State v. Martinez, 2007-NMCA-160, 143 N.M. 96, 173 P.3d 18, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-011.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— The crime of attempted CSP III is subsumed within assault with intent to commit CSP. Proof of an overt act done with the intent of forcing CSP required by attempted CSP III is satisfied by the same proof required for the attempted restraint by force in the assault (attempted battery) charge.State v. Schackow, 2006-NMCA-123, 140 N.M. 506, 143 P.3d 745, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-008, 140 N.M. 422, 143 P.3d 184.\n\nMultiple counts of criminal sexual penetration.— Section 30-9-11 NMSA 1878 cannot be said as a matter of law to evince a legislative intent to punish separately each penetration occurring during a continuous attack absent proof that each act of penetration is in some sense distinct from the others. In determining whether an act is distinct our analysis is informed by the following factors culled from decisions of other jurisdictions that have considered the issue of multiple punishment in cases of rape: (1) temporal proximity of penetrations (the greater the interval between acts the greater the likelihood of separate offenses); (2) location of the victim during each penetration (movement or repositioning of the victim between penetrations tends to show separate offenses); (3) existence of an intervening event; (4) sequencing of penetrations (serial penetrations of different orifices, as opposed to repeated penetrations of the same orifice, tend to establish separate offenses); (5) defendant's intent as evidenced by his conduct and utterances; and (6) number of victims (although not relevant here, multiple victims will likely give rise to multiple offenses).Herron v. State, 1991-NMSC-012, 111 N.M. 357, 805 P.2d 624.\n\nThe term \"sexual intercourse\"includes penetration of the vulva even when the vaginal canal is not penetrated.State v. Tafoya, 2010-NMCA-010, 147 N.M. 602, 227 P.3d 92, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-012, 147 N.M. 600, 227 P.3d 90.\n\nApplicable statute of limitations.— Where the state alleges that defendant committed criminal sexual penetration of a minor under the age of 13 between September and December of 1988 and in January of 1989, the applicable statute of limitations at the time defendant allegedly committed the crime is 15 years.State v. Hill, 2005-NMCA-143, 138 N.M. 693, 125 P.3d 1175, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-012, 138 N.M. 772, 126 P.3d 1136.\n\nExclusion of defendant from courtroom.— Defendant's exclusion from the courtroom while child testified created a substantial risk that the jury would assume that the trial court believed that the defendant had engaged in misconduct necessitating his absence from the courtroom.State v. Rodriguez, 1992-NMCA-088, 114 N.M. 265, 837 P.2d 459.\n\nDefendant absent from trial voluntarily.— Factors articulated inState v. Clements, 1988-NMCA-094, 108 N.M. 13, 765 P.2d 1195, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 785, 765 P.2d 758, as to waiver of right to be present being occasioned by the voluntary absence of an accused, were to be applied only when the defendant was absent from trial voluntarily.State v. Rodriguez, 1992-NMCA-088, 114 N.M. 265, 837 P.2d 459.\n\nTrial of co-defendants.— Whether separate trials are to be held for defendants jointly indicted for attempted forcible rape was a matter to be addressed to and resolved by the sound discretion of the trial court.State v. Pope, 1967-NMCA-010, 78 N.M. 282, 430 P.2d 779.\n\nDefense of mistake of fact.— Twenty year-old defendant's conviction of fourth degree criminal sexual penetration was reversed, where the trial court did not consider his defense of mistake of fact, which was based on evidence that he had asked the fifteen year-old victim her age and was told by her and another person that she was seventeen.Perez v. State, 1990-NMSC-115, 111 N.M. 160, 803 P.2d 249.\n\nProsecutor's remarks held prejudicial.— The prosecutor made a legally incorrect statement of the law when he told the jury the crime for which the defendant was charged (criminal sexual penetration) was less serious than committing the crime with a weapon, thus invading the province of the court to give instructions on the law. Because the evidence of defendant's guilt was less than overwhelming, it is fair to assume that the prosecutor's remarks had some prejudicial impact, substantial enough to require a new trial at the trial court's discretion.State v. Gonzales, 1986-NMCA-050, 105 N.M. 238, 731 P.2d 381, cert. quashed, 105 N.M. 211, 730 P.2d 1193 (1987).\n\nAdoption of child conceived as result of rape.— Man convicted of criminal sexual penetration of a child had no constitutional right under the due process clauses of the United States or New Mexico Constitutions to withhold consent to adoption of the child conceived and born as a result of that act.Christian Child Placement Serv. of the N.M. Christian Children's Home v. Vestal, 1998-NMCA-098, 125 N.M. 426, 962 P.2d 1261.\n\nSpouses living apart.— The phrase \"living apart\" as the phrase is used in the definition of the term \"spouse\" in Section 30-9-10 NMSA 1978 suggests that Section 30-9-11 NMSA 1978 was designed to prohibit nonconsensual sexual activity among married persons during interruption of the relationship and there is no indication that the legislature intended either a durational requirement or the existence of measures to terminate the marriage to impose criminal liability on one spouse for the rape of another.Brescheisen v. Mondragon, 833 F.2d 238 (10th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1011, 108 S. Ct. 1479, 99 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1988).\n\nB. CONSTITUTIONALITY.\n\nSpeedy trial.— The right to a speedy trial based on a 1989 original complaint, which was dismissed, did not run from 1989 to 2002 when charges were re-filed because defendant was not an \"accused\" and knew he was not an \"accused\" during the approximately 13-year interval when no criminal sexual penetration of a minor under the age of 13 charges were pending against him. Therefore, defendant's speedy trial right did not attach until 2002.State v. Hill, 2005-NMCA-143, 138 N.M. 693, 125 P.3d 1175, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-012, 138 N.M. 772, 126 P.3d 1136.\n\nPhrase \"perpetrated by the use of force or coercion\" not vague.— Phrase \"perpetrated by the use of force or coercion\" in this section is not unconstitutionally vague since the crime is defined in terms of a result that defendant causes, and if a defendant causes such a result by the use of force or coercion, force or coercion was the method which caused the result, that is, the crime.State v. Jiminez, 1976-NMCA-096, 89 N.M. 652, 556 P.2d 60.\n\nDistinctions between degrees on basis of harm constitutional.— Determining the degree of a crime by the amount of the harm done to the victim does not make the statute unconstitutionally vague.State v. Jiminez, 1976-NMCA-096, 89 N.M. 652, 556 P.2d 60.\n\nSection not void for vagueness.— Criminal sexual penetration could be committed by the use of force or coercion without the victim suffering personal injury as a result thereof and the distinction between second and third degree criminal sexual penetration based on personal injury to the victim is not void for vagueness as a matter of law.State v. Jiminez, 1976-NMCA-096, 89 N.M. 652, 556 P.2d 60.\n\nThis section is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, nor does the statute encourage arbitrary or discriminatory prosecution.State v. Pierce, 1990-NMSC-049, 110 N.M. 76, 792 P.2d 408.\n\nFormer sodomy statute constitutional.— Former 40A-9-6, 1953 Comp., which embraced and proscribed sodomitic conduct even on the part of consenting adults was constitutionally valid.State v. Elliott, 1976-NMSC-030, 89 N.M. 305, 551 P.2d 1352 (decided under prior law, statute repealed).\n\nAnd not violative of right of privacy.— On attack by an inmate of penal institution against constitutionality of former sodomy statute on grounds that it violated right of privacy, nothing in the language of the act could reasonably be considered as violative of any constitutionally protected area, nor did the record disclose an unconstitutional application of the law in the particular instance.Washington v. Rodriguez, 1971-NMCA-021, 82 N.M. 428, 483 P.2d 309 (decided under prior law, statute repealed).\n\nStanding to challenge constitutionality.— Defendant's claims that definitional distinctions which go to difference between first and second degree criminal sexual penetration are unconstitutionally vague would not be considered by the appeals court when defendant was convicted of second degree criminal sexual penetration.State v. Jiminez, 1976-NMCA-096, 89 N.M. 652, 556 P.2d 60.\n\nSince defendant did not claim nor argue that he was a member of the class discriminated against by the former sodomy statute or that his rights had been impaired by application of the statute to him, he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the act.State v. Armstrong, 1973-NMCA-081, 85 N.M. 234, 511 P.2d 560, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 228, 511 P.2d 554,overruled byState v. Elliott, 1975-NMCA-087, 88 N.M. 187, 539 P.2d 207;State v. Kasakoff, 1972-NMCA-151, 84 N.M. 404, 503 P.2d 1182.\n\nIn prosecution for sodomy, where the state's evidence was that the act was committed by force and the defendant denied committing the act, defendant could not then argue that the incident was a consensual act between two adult persons and that the statute was unconstitutional as overbroad for prohibiting private consensual acts of adults.State v. Kasakoff, 1972-NMCA-151, 84 N.M. 404, 503 P.2d 1182.\n\nSpouses living apart.— Where, at the time defendant broke into the house in which defendant's spouse lived and forcibly had sexual contact with the spouse, defendant and the spouse were living apart, defendant did not have standing to challenge Section 30-9-11 NMSA 1978 on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad, because it infringed on privacy in marriage which is a protected right of association under the First Amendment.Brescheisen v. Mondragon, 833 F.2d 238 (10th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1011, 108 S. Ct. 1479, 99 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1988).\n\nSection 30-9-11 NMSA 1978 is not unconstitutionally vagueeven though the phrase \"living apart\" is not defined as that phrase is used in the definition of the term \"spouse\" in Section 30-9-10 NMSA 1978.Brescheisen v. Mondragon, 833 F.2d 238 (10th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1011, 108 S. Ct. 1479, 99 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1988).\n\nC. ELEMENTS OF OFFENSE.\n\nCriminal sexual penetration based on the commission of a felony.— When criminal sexual penetration in the second degree is based on the commission of a felony, it must be a felony that is committed against the victim of, and that assists in the accomplishment of, sexual penetration by force or coercion or against a victim who, by age or other statutory factor, gave no lawful consent. Simply causing another person to engage in otherwise lawful sexual intercourse at the same time a felony is being committed does not constitute the crime of criminal sexual penetration during the commission of a felony. The jury should be instructed that the crime of criminal sexual penetration during the commission of a felony requires the commission of unlawful sexual activity with the victim of the felony.State v. Stevens, 2014-NMSC-011,overruling in part State v. Maestas, 2005-NMCA-062, 137 N.M. 477.\n\nWhere defendant directed the victim to perform oral sex on defendant's friend after the three injected methamphetamine together; defendant did not force the victim to perform oral sex; the victim complied with defendant's direction because the victim was high and did not care; defendant was charged with causing criminal sexual penetration during the commission of the felony of distribution of a controlled substance to a minor; and the jury was not instructed that the state was required to prove that the sexual penetration was unlawful and that the penetration was caused by the commission of a felony against the victim, the deficiency in the jury instructions did not result in fundamental error, because the sexual relation between the victim, who was thirteen years of age, and defendant's friend, who was as least ten years older, was unlawful and the fact that it was after the victim had been injected with methamphetamine that the victim acquiesced to defendant's direction to perform oral sex established the nexus of causation between the commission of the felony against the victim and the resulting unlawful sexual act committed on the victim. State v. Stevens, 2014-NMSC-011,overruling in partState v. Maestas, 2005-NMCA-062, 137 N.M. 477.\n\nUse of force.— Where the defendant ensured the physical isolation of the location where the incident occurred; locked the doors of the car; unbuttoned and took off the thirteen-year old victim's pants; told the victim that she was ready for intercourse despite her disagreement; reclined the victim's car seat and then climbed on top of her, initiating sex by forcing the victim's legs open; and persisted in having intercourse with the victim after she told the defendant that it hurt and asked him to stop, the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction of sexual penetration through the use of force or coercion.State v. Perea, 2008-NMCA-147, 145 N.M. 123, 194 P.3d 738, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-009, 145 N.M. 257, 196 P.3d 488.\n\nCriminal sexual penetration is not continuing offense.— Once the penetration is perpetrated, that criminal sexual penetration is a completed offense.State v. Ramirez, 1978-NMCA-102, 92 N.M. 206, 585 P.2d 651;State v. Corneau, 1989-NMCA-040, 109 N.M. 81, 781 P.2d 1159, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 668, 777 P.2d 907.\n\nPenetration not essential.— Despite the heading \"Criminal sexual penetration\" for this section, the offense does not require penetration.State v. Delgado, 1991-NMCA-064, 112 N.M. 335, 815 P.2d 631, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 220, 813 P.2d 1018.\n\nForce or coercion not an element.— Force or coercion is not an essential element of second degree criminal sexual penetration when defendant is in a position of authority over an inmate.State v. Maestas, 2005-NMCA-062, 137 N.M. 477, 112 P.3d 1134,rev'd on other grounds, 2007-NMSC-001, 140 N.M. 836, 149 P.3d 933.\n\n\"Anguish\" as personal injury.— \"Anguish\" means \"distress,\" and mental anguish is distress of the mind; if such results from the use of force or coercion it is personal injury under this statute.State v. Jiminez, 1976-NMCA-096, 89 N.M. 652, 556 P.2d 60.\n\nSpecific intent to rapewas not element of the crime.State v. Ramirez, 1972-NMCA-108, 84 N.M. 166, 500 P.2d 451, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 180, 500 P.2d 1303.\n\nIntent.— The wording of this section was not meant to impose the additional requirement of showing specific intent. The intent which must be present to perform the act satisfies the \"intentional causing\" provision in this section.State v. Keyonnie, 1977-NMSC-097, 91 N.M. 146, 571 P.2d 413.\n\nVoluntary drunkenness no defense.— Instruction that rape requires no specific intent and that voluntary drunkenness is neither excuse nor justification for crime of rape was correct.State v. Ramirez, 1972-NMCA-108, 84 N.M. 166, 500 P.2d 451, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 180, 500 P.2d 1303.\n\nSpecific sexual intent not an element.— The legislature did not intend to adopt a requirement of specific sexual intent as an element of this section.State v. Pierce, 1990-NMSC-049, 110 N.M. 76, 792 P.2d 408.\n\nProof of intent.— State was not required to prove motive or intent.State v. Alva, 1913-NMSC-056, 18 N.M. 143, 134 P. 209.\n\n\"Perpetrated,\"in Subsection D, means accomplished, performed, committed.State v. Ramirez, 1978-NMCA-102, 92 N.M. 206, 585 P.2d 651.\n\nPenetration must be intentional.— To prove criminal sexual penetration in the third degree, the state must establish that the penetration was intentional.State v. Lucero, 1994-NMCA-129, 118 N.M. 696, 884 P.2d 1175, cert. denied, 118 N.M. 731, 885 P.2d 1325.\n\nChild under age of 13.— Causing a child under the age of 13 to engage in cunnilingus, even where there is no penetration, is sufficient to establish violation of this section.State v. Orona, 1982-NMSC-002, 97 N.M. 232, 638 P.2d 1077.\n\nPenetration and felony must be continuous transaction under Subsection D(4) (now E(5)).— If a criminal sexual penetration occurs within the res gestae of a felony, Subsection D(4) (now E(5)) is applicable, and for the sexual penetration to come within the res gestae, the felony and the sexual penetration must be part of one continuous transaction and closely connected in point of time, place and causal connection.State v. Martinez, 1982-NMCA-053, 98 N.M. 27, 644 P.2d 541, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794.\n\nMeans of committing offense.— Former law defining rape did not embrace several distinct offenses, but merely defined the various means by which the same offense might be committed.Territory v. Edie, 1892-NMSC-019, 6 N.M. 555, 30 P. 851,aff'd on rehearing, 1893-NMSC-016, 7 N.M. 183, 34 P. 46.\n\nForce or coercion.— Unless there is force or coercion beyond that inherent in almost every criminal sexual penetration, the proper charge is third degree criminal sexual penetration.State v. Pisio, 1994-NMCA-152, 119 N.M. 252, 889 P.2d 860, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 20, 888 P.2d 466.\n\nIntercourse with underage girl.— Rape could be perpetrated in any of the ways set out in the statutes and sexual intercourse with a girl with her consent constituted rape if she was less than 16 (now 13) years of age.State v. Richardson, 1944-NMSC-059, 48 N.M. 544, 154 P.2d 224.\n\nSubmission to request of authority figure is coercionif it is achieved through undue influence or affected by external forces.State v. Gillette, 1985-NMCA-037, 102 N.M. 695, 699 P.2d 626.\n\nConsensual sex between therapist and adult patient.— A defendant's conduct did not constitute the crimes of second or third degree criminal sexual penetration because consensual sex between a therapist and his adult patient is not a crime.State v. Leiding, 1991-NMCA-043, 112 N.M. 143, 812 P.2d 797, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 77, 811 P.2d 575.\n\nSpouses living apart.— Where defendant's spouse asked defendant to move out of their house several days before defendant broke into the house and forcibly had sexual contact with the spouse; the separation was to last a month to give the spouse time to decide whether to seek a divorce; defendant believed defendant had no choice but to move out; and defendant moved some of defendant's belongings out of the house and visited the spouse only to get work clothes and toiletries, there was a suspension of the marital relationship at the time defendant forcibly had sexual contact with the spouse.Brescheisen v. Mondragon, 833 F.2d 238 (10th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1011, 108 S. Ct. 1479, 99 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1988).\n\nGuilt of each participant.— A person engages in sexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, or anal intercourse if that person is one of the two persons required for the performance of the act.State v. Delgado, 1991-NMCA-064, 112 N.M. 335, 815 P.2d 631, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 220, 813 P.2d 1018.\n\nStatutory language genderless.— The genderless language used in the statute makes clear that the defendant can be either male or female.State v. Delgado, 1991-NMCA-064, 112 N.M. 335, 815 P.2d 631, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 220, 813 P.2d 1018.\n\nChild not conceived \"as a result of rape\".— Child conceived as a result of fourth degree criminal sexual penetration of a 16-year-old was not conceived \"as a result of rape\" authorizing dismissal of the father from adoption proceedings under Subsection C of 32A-5-19 NMSA 1978.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. Paul P., 1999-NMCA-077, 127 N.M. 492, 983 P.2d 1011.\n\nDefendant entitled to discoveryof information relevant to element of mental anguish which the state has to prove.State v. Garcia, 1980-NMCA-061, 94 N.M. 583, 613 P.2d 725, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 675, 615 P.2d 992.\n\nDefendant may require complaining witness to undergo psychological examination.— When the mental condition of the victim is relevant because the state alleges the force or coercion resulted in mental anguish to the victim, defendant may require complaining witness to undergo a psychological examination, in order to adequately prepare his defense.State v. Garcia, 1980-NMCA-061, 94 N.M. 583, 613 P.2d 725, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 675, 615 P.2d 992.\n\nD. MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS OR PUNISHMENTS.\n\nCriminal sexual penetration and assault with intent to commit criminal sexual penetration on household member.— Criminal sexual penetration and assault with intent to commit criminal sexual penetration on a household member are separate offenses.State v. Jensen, 2005-NMCA-113, 138 N.M. 254, 118 P.3d 762, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-011, 138 N.M. 587, 124 P.3d 565.\n\nThird degree criminal sexual penetration becomes second degree criminal sexual penetrationwhen it is committed during the commission of any other felony.Florez v. Williams, 281 F.3d 1136 (10th Cir. 2002).\n\nOffense of enticement of child is not lesser included offenseof criminal sexual penetration.State v. Garcia, 1983-NMCA-069, 100 N.M. 120, 666 P.2d 1267, cert. denied, 100 N.M. 192, 668 P.2d 308.\n\nAggravated sodomy and murder not merged.— Homicide resulting from great bodily harm provided sufficient evidence for the jury to find aggravated sodomy and first degree kidnapping, and there was no merger with the charge of murder of which defendant was acquitted.State v. Melton, 1977-NMSC-014, 90 N.M. 188, 561 P.2d 461.\n\nMerger of attempted criminal sexual penetration and criminal sexual contact of minor from unitary conduct.— Despite the state's contention that the conduct underlying the offenses charged against the defendant was not unitary, in that the defendant's action of lying on the victim constituted criminal sexual contact of a minor and his action of preparing to \"hump\" her constituted attempted criminal sexual penetration of a minor, the actions can only reasonably be deemed to constitute unitary conduct; the contact and attempted penetration all took place within the same short space of time, with no physical separation between the illegal acts.State v. Mora, 2003-NMCA-072, 133 N.M. 746, 69 P.3d 256, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 727, 69 P.3d 237.\n\nCriminal sexual contact of minor is not lesser included offense of attempted criminal sexual penetration.— For purposes of double jeopardy, the offenses of criminal sexual contact of a minor and attempted criminal sexual penetration of a minor cannot be characterized as lesser included and greater inclusive crimes because they each contain different elements and stand independently in relation to one another.State v. Mora, 2003-NMCA-072, 133 N.M. 746, 69 P.3d 256, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 727, 69 P.3d 237.\n\nCharges of kidnapping and second degree criminal sexual penetration do not mergesince the elements of the offense of second degree criminal sexual penetration do not involve all of the elements of kidnapping.State v. Singleton, 1984-NMCA-110, 102 N.M. 66, 691 P.2d 67.\n\nThe fact that a kidnapping charge was used to raise a charge of criminal sexual penetration to a second degree felony does not pose a double jeopardy problem. Convictions normally are allowed for both predicate and compound offenses, and criminal sexual penetration statutes and kidnapping statutes protect different social norms.State v. McGuire, 1990-NMSC-067, 110 N.M. 304, 795 P.2d 996.\n\nUnder the facts of this case, the jury could have inferred from facts other than the rape itself that defendant intended to hold the victim against her will from the moment of the abduction. Since the conduct underlying the offenses is not the same, the double jeopardy clause does not prohibit multiple punishments in this case.State v. Ramos, 1993-NMCA-072, 115 N.M. 718, 858 P.2d 94, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 602, 856 P.2d 250.\n\nMerger of criminal sexual penetration and kidnapping based on same act.— Defendant's convictions for second degree criminal sexual penetration (commission of a felony) and kidnapping (no great bodily harm) under Section 30-4-1 NMSA 1978, stemming from the same act of sexual intercourse, potentially violated double jeopardy rights and were required to be set aside.State v. Crain, 1997-NMCA-101, 124 N.M. 84, 946 P.2d 1095.\n\nConsecutive sentences for kidnapping and criminal sexual penetration.— Consecutive sentences for the compound crime of criminal sexual penetration during commission of kidnapping and the predicate felony of kidnapping with intent to hold for service is, in general, permissible because the two crimes address different social norms.State v. Tsethlikai, 1989-NMCA-107, 109 N.M. 371, 785 P.2d 282, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 262, 784 P.2d 1005 (1990).\n\nConsective sentences.— Consecutive sentences for kidnapping and criminal sexual penetration did not violate the double jeopardy prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense, where the evidence supported an inference that defendant intended to commit criminal sexual penetration from the moment of the abduction.State v. McGuire, 1990-NMSC-067, 110 N.M. 304, 795 P.2d 996.\n\nWhere the defendant took control of the car at gunpoint and then drove the victims to a remote location before raping them, the crime of kidnapping was complete before the act of criminal sexual penetration began; because the two crimes did not constitute a \"unitary act,\" imposition of consecutive sentences was not double jeopardy.State v. Andazola, 2003-NMCA-146, 134 N.M. 710, 82 P.3d 77.\n\nForce or coercion for kidnapping or false imprisonment.— A person is entitled to withdraw his or her consent or express a lack of consent to an act of criminal sexual penetration at any point prior to the act itself, but force or coercion exerted prior to the act itself will support a conviction for kidnapping or false imprisonment.State v. Pisio, 1994-NMCA-152, 119 N.M. 252, 889 P.2d 860, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 20, 888 P.2d 466.\n\nFalse imprisonment and criminal sexual penetration II.— Defendant's convictions of false imprisonment and criminal sexual penetration in the second degree which arose out of the same conduct violated the double jeopardy clause.State v. Armendariz, 2006-NMCA-152, 140 N.M. 712, 148 P.3d 798, cert. quashed, 2008-NMCERT-002, 143 N.M. 667, 180 P.3d 674.\n\nFalse imprisonment and criminal sexual penetration III.— Defendant's convictions for false imprisonment and criminal sexual penetration without the use of a deadly weapon which arose out of the same conduct did not violate the double jeopardy clause.State v. Fielder, 2005-NMCA-108, 138 N.M. 244, 118 P.3d 752, cert. quashed, 2006-NMCERT-004, 139 N.M. 430, 134 P.3d 123.\n\nNo merger of false imprisonment and criminal sexual penetration.— There was sufficient evidence to support separate charges for false imprisonment and criminal sexual penetration where the victim testified that defendant would not let her out of the bedroom for a period of time after the penetration occurred.State v. Traeger, 2000-NMCA-015, 128 N.M. 668, 997 P.2d 142,aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 2001-NMSC-022, 130 N.M. 618, 29 P.3d 518.\n\nNo merger of aggravated burglary and criminal sexual penetration.— Since aggravated burglary (Section 30-16-4 NMSA 1978) and criminal sexual penetration in the third degree each require proof of facts which the other does not and since neither offense necessarily involves the other, there is no double jeopardy violation and no merger of the offenses despite the fact that the same evidence may go toward proving both.State v. Young, 1978-NMCA-040, 91 N.M. 647, 579 P.2d 179, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 751, 580 P.2d 972, and cert. denied, 439 U.S. 957, 99 S. Ct. 357, 58 L. Ed. 2d 348 (1978).\n\nNo merger of offenses.— Where there was evidence that the victim awoke and found the defendant on top of her and that the defendant told her not to move or make a noise or he would blow her head off, that was evidence of a battery. When the battery preceded sexual activity, there was evidence of an aggravated burglary apart from a sex offense, and the two offenses did not merge, nor was the \"same transaction\" test applied.State v. Archunde, 1978-NMCA-050, 91 N.M. 682, 579 P.2d 808.\n\nWhere defendant's acts constituting battery for purposes of aggravated burglary charges and acts constituting criminal sexual penetration (CSP) were separate and distinct, convictions and consecutive sentences for both CSP and aggravated burglary did not violate double jeopardy.Lucero v. Kerby, 133 F.3d 1299 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1110, 118 S. Ct. 1684, 140 L. Ed. 2d 821 (1998).\n\nAggravated burglary and attempted criminal sexual penetration merged.— Defendant's conduct consisting of his entry into a dwelling with intent to commit a felony and attempted criminal sexual penetration (CSP II) was unitary; thus, his convictions for both aggravated burglary and attempted CSP II violated double jeopardy.Lucero v. Kerby, 133 F.3d 1299 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1110, 118 S. Ct. 1684, 140 L. Ed. 2d 821 (1998).\n\nContributing to delinquency is separate offense.— Criminal sexual penetration of a minor requires proof of sexual penetration and contributing to delinquency of a minor requires proof that the defendant's act or omission contributed to the delinquency of a minor, and neither of those facts is required to prove the other. The legislature intended separate punishments for criminal sexual penetration of a minor and contributing to delinquency of a minor when the same conduct violates both statutes.State v. Walker, 1993-NMSC-069, 116 N.M. 546, 865 P.2d 1190.\n\nFelony-murder doctrine applied.— Applying the strict-elements test, first degree criminal sexual penetration (CSP) is not a lesser included offense of second degree murder and, accordingly, first degree CSP could properly serve as a predicate for applying the felony-murder doctrine.State v. Campos, 1996-NMSC-043, 122 N.M. 148, 921 P.2d 1266.\n\nSentence and prison discipline for same offense.— Contention by inmates convicted of sodomy that sentence imposed by court amounted to double jeopardy because they had already been punished by prison officials for same offense was without merit.Washington v. Rodriguez, 1971-NMCA-021, 82 N.M. 428, 483 P.2d 309.\n\nMultiple sentences improper.— Consecutive sentences of 45 to 50 years and 80 to 99 years imposed on defendant for convictions of assault with intent to commit rape and rape, respectively, were improper, since where charges arose out of the same transaction, were committed at the same time as part of a continuous act and were inspired by the same criminal intent which was an essential element of each offense, they were susceptible of only one punishment.State v. Blackwell, 1966-NMSC-088, 76 N.M. 445, 415 P.2d 563.\n\nIncreasing sentence based on consideration of element of offense.— Where defendant noted that physical injury is an element of the crime of second degree criminal sexual penetration under Subsection D(3) (now E(3)), and he contended that the trial court's consideration of the physical injury suffered by the victim in increasing the basic sentence pursuant to § 31-18-15.1 exposed him to double jeopardy, it was held that the court's consideration of circumstances surrounding an element of the offense did not expose defendant to double jeopardy.State v. Bernal, 1987-NMCA-075, 106 N.M. 117, 739 P.2d 986, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 81, 738 P.2d 1326.\n\nAggravating factor improperly considered in sentencing.— While the victim's blood relationship to defendant arguably was a circumstance surrounding the offense of criminal sexual penetration, it was error for the court to consider such relationship as an aggravating factor at sentencing on a criminal sexual penetration count after defendant had also been convicted of incest.Swafford v. State, 1991-NMSC-043, 112 N.M. 3, 810 P.2d 1223.\n\nMultiple penetrations.— Penetrations of separate orifices with the same object constitute separate offenses. Therefore, the acts of anal intercourse, sexual intercourse, and at least one instance of fellatio constitute separate offenses.State v. Wilson, 1993-NMCA-074, 117 N.M. 11, 868 P.2d 656, cert. quashed, 119 N.M. 311, 889 P.2d 1233 (1995).\n\nNumber of contacts.— The number of contacts is not dispositive of the existence of a separate violation of this section.State v. Pisio, 1994-NMCA-152, 119 N.M. 252, 889 P.2d 860, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 20, 888 P.2d 466.\n\nSingle criminal intent of several acts.— Defendant's contention that \"single criminal intent\" doctrine should have been applied to four acts of sodomy which he was convicted of having performed on victim over period of one and one half to two hours was neither supported by sufficient evidence nor properly preserved for review.State v. Elliott, 1977-NMSC-002, 89 N.M. 756, 557 P.2d 1105.\n\nMultiple penetrations.— This section cannot be said, as a matter of law, to evince a legislative intent to punish separately each penetration occurring during a continuous attack absent proof that each act of penetration is in some sense distinct from the others.Herron v. State, 1991-NMSC-012, 111 N.M. 357, 805 P.2d 624.\n\nA case involving a single defendant tried on an indictment alleging multiple penetrations was remanded to the trial court with instructions to vacate 14 convictions and sentences for second degree criminal sexual penetration and to resentence accordingly, where the evidence supported, at most, five convictions and sentences.Herron v. State, 1991-NMSC-012, 111 N.M. 357, 805 P.2d 624.\n\nDefense must raise \"single criminal intent\"doctrine at trial.State v. Elliott, 1977-NMSC-002, 89 N.M. 756, 557 P.2d 1105.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Where the evidence established that defendant committed three separate and distinct battery offenses, double jeopardy did not preclude the first two batteries supporting a conviction for battery, even though the third battery satisfied elements of a charge of criminal sexual penetration.Brecheisen v. Mondragon, 833 F.2d 238 (10th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1011, 108 S. Ct. 1479, 99 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1988).\n\nThere is no double jeopardy impediment to convicting and sentencing a defendant to consecutive terms for both incest and criminal sexual penetration arising out of the same act.Swafford v. State, 1991-NMSC-043, 112 N.M. 3, 810 P.2d 1223.\n\nThere was no double jeopardy bar to punishment for the offenses of assault with intent to commit rape and criminal sexual penetration, where the victim testified at trial that defendant bound her to a bed, struck her several times, and threatened her verbally for a period of time before commencing the sexual assault.Swafford v. State, 1991-NMSC-043, 112 N.M. 3, 810 P.2d 1223.\n\nWhen the defendant received consecutive sentences upon his plea of guilty to second degree criminal sexual penetration, aggravated burglary, kidnapping, and aggravated battery, in order to support a double jeopardy challenge he had the burden to provide a sufficient record for the court to determine unitary conduct for purposes of the double jeopardy analysis.State v. Sanchez, 1996-NMCA-089, 122 N.M. 280, 923 P.2d 1165.\n\nBecause the crimes of kidnapping and attempted criminal sexual penetration contain elements not contained in the Order Prohibiting Domestic Violence (OPDV) obtained by victim against defendant, defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated by his conviction for those crimes following his conviction for contempt for violating the OPDV.State v. Powers, 1998-NMCA-133, 126 N.M. 114, 967 P.2d 454, cert. quashed, 127 N.M. 392, 981 P.2d 1210 (1999).\n\nDefendant's right to freedom from double jeopardy was not violated by punishment for attempted first degree murder, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and criminal sexual penetration.State v. Traeger, 2000-NMCA-015, 128 N.M. 668, 997 P.2d 142,aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 2001-NMSC-022, 130 N.M. 618, 29 P.3d 518.\n\nWhere an assault was with an intent to commit criminal sexual penetration, followed then by criminal sexual penetration, the fear, and the acts of penetration with resulting personal injury, are reasonably separable in terms of harm and social evil, and are sufficient to reflect a legislative intent to punish the conduct separately such that the defendant was not placed in double jeopardy.State v. Jensen, 2005-NMCA-113, 138 N.M. 254, 118 P.3d 762, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-011, 138 N.M. 587, 124 P.3d 565.\n\nII. INDICTMENT AND INFORMATION.\n\nInformation not unconstitutionally vague.— Where information expressly stated age of minor rape victim, and that age was under 10 years, argument that the information was so vague and indefinite as to violate due process in that it stated an offense both under statute covering rape of female under or over 16 when resistance is overcome by force, and also under statute relating to rape of female child under 10, was without merit.Gallegos v. Cox, 358 F.2d 703 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 869, 87 S. Ct. 138, 17 L. Ed. 2d 97 (1966).\n\nNotice sufficient.— The trial court did not deprive defendant of opportunity to be informed of charges against him by failing to require the state to specify precisely which of several acts of sodomy defendant was accused of having been accessory to, where the indictment and bill of particulars which were a part of the record identified the date, the approximate time and nature of the crimes alleged, the prosecutrix and the associates with whom defendant was alleged to have committed the crimes.State v. Barnett, 1973-NMCA-098, 85 N.M. 404, 512 P.2d 977.\n\nLack of specificity not violative of double jeopardy.— The trial court's refusal to require that the state specify which act of sodomy the defendant was accessory to did not subject him to double jeopardy, on the basis of the argument that if he were indicted or informed against as accessory to a particular act of sodomy based on the same incident he could not point to his present conviction as precluding his trial on any particular act of sodomy, where he had not been indicted or informed against for another crime growing out of the same set of facts.State v. Barnett, 1973-NMCA-098, 85 N.M. 404, 512 P.2d 977.\n\nSeparate counts of incest and criminal sexual penetration.— There was no error in charging defendant on separate counts of criminal sexual penetration and incest under a theory that he had sexual intercourse with a child under 13 years of age and a child between 13 and 16 years of age, and he knew each was his biological daughter.State v. Hargrove, 1989-NMSC-012, 108 N.M. 233, 771 P.2d 166.\n\nLanguage of statute sufficient.— It was unnecessary to charge crime pursuant to the common law; an indictment in language of statute which in effect charged sexual intercourse with a female under the age of fourteen was sufficient, use of the word \"ravish\" being unnecessary.State v. Alva, 1913-NMSC-056, 18 N.M. 143, 134 P. 209.\n\nUse of words \"carnally know and abuse\"in indictment was surplusage.State v. Alva, 1913-NMSC-056, 18 N.M. 143, 134 P. 209.\n\nCharge of rape adequate.— An information \"did, with force and arms in and upon the body of Agnes Vigil . . . unlawfully and feloniously make an assault, and did then and there wickedly and feloniously against her will . . . ravish and unlawfully know, contrary to the form of the statute . . .\" was sufficient to charge rape and not merely an assault, notwithstanding the omission of any such words as \"her the said Agnes Vigil\" between the words \"know\" and \"contrary.\"State v. Alarid, 1936-NMSC-047, 40 N.M. 450, 62 P.2d 817.\n\nInformation failing to name statutory rape victimnot fatally defective.State v. Roessler, 1954-NMSC-017, 58 N.M. 102, 266 P.2d 351;Ex parte Kelley, 1953-NMSC-011, 57 N.M. 161, 256 P.2d 211.\n\nAssault with intent to rape.— An indictment charging that defendant unlawfully, violently and forcibly assaulted prosecutrix with intent to ravish was sufficient charge of assault with intent to rape.State v. Raulie, 1930-NMSC-074, 35 N.M. 135, 290 P. 789.\n\nAllegation of defendant's virility unnecessary.— It was unnecessary that indictment allege that defendant was over the age of fourteen or, being under that age, had the physical ability to commit the offense.State v. Ancheta, 1915-NMSC-003, 20 N.M. 19, 145 P. 1086.\n\nInformation and bill construed together.— In determining whether acts alleged constituted offense of sodomy, the information and the bill of particulars are to be read together as a single instrument.State v. Putman, 1967-NMCA-020, 78 N.M. 552, 434 P.2d 77.\n\nOverinclusive bill of particulars not binding.— Although bill of particulars alleged two acts of sodomy, namely, requiring victim to take into her mouth the defendant's sexual organ and the placing of defendant's sexual organ in the victim's anus, the state was not bound by the statement in the bill of particulars to prove acts of both types of sodomy on the part of the defendant, and failure to instruct that the state must prove both types of sodomy before a conviction would be justified did not require reversal.State v. Barnett, 1973-NMCA-098, 85 N.M. 404, 512 P.2d 977.\n\nVariance between information and instructions.— Jury instructions describing crime perpetrated by defendant as that of sexual intercourse with a female under sixteen years impaired no fundamental rights of defendant even though the crime was charged as \"rape\" in the information.State v. Richardson, 1944-NMSC-059, 48 N.M. 544, 154 P.2d 224.\n\nIII. EVIDENCE.\n\nA. ADMISSIBILITY.\n\nDismissal unwarranted.— Where the state did not pursue the case of criminal sexual penetration of a minor under the age of 13 in 1989, because, at that time, it lacked the evidence to go forward with the case, but the young child victim who in 1989 was apparently too traumatized to testify voluntarily came forward at a later age to testify, and there is no evidence that the state intended the delay to work a tactical disadvantage on defendant or that the state knew or should have known that the delay would cause any specific tactical disadvantage to defendant and defendant does not assert that the state improperly obtained such a tactical advantage, dismissal is not warranted on this basis.State v. Hill, 2005-NMCA-143, 138 N.M. 693, 125 P.3d 1175, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-012, 138 N.M. 772, 126 P.3d 1136.\n\nSubsequent beating irrelevant to determination of degree of offense.— Defendant's beating of the victim with a blunt instrument subsequent to intercourse was not considered in determining whether or not the offense of criminal sexual penetration was committed by force or coercion resulting in personal injury because this beating went to the aggravated battery conviction.State v. Jiminez, 1976-NMCA-096, 89 N.M. 652, 556 P.2d 60.\n\nOut-of-court identification.— Where victim testified that rapist was in her presence for approximately an hour and 40 minutes and at the police station she described him with some specificity, action of police officer in showing victim the driver's license photograph which victim knew came from wallet she had taken from rapist's pocket and asking \"is this the man\" was not so suggestive as to bar evidence of victim's out-of-court identification, nor was in-court identification inadmissibly tainted because of it.State v. Baldonado, 1971-NMCA-068, 82 N.M. 581, 484 P.2d 1291.\n\nThe out-of-court photographic identification procedure was not so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification where the photographs viewed by the victim were all of male caucasians of about the same age and hirsuteness as defendant.State v. Clark, 1986-NMCA-058, 104 N.M. 434, 722 P.2d 685, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 378, 721 P.2d 1309.\n\nIdentification by child.— Testimony by witness that three-year old child said \"this is the man\" a half hour after attack upon her was properly admitted over objection that it was hearsay.State v. Godwin, 1947-NMSC-016, 51 N.M. 65, 178 P.2d 584.\n\nVictim's identification was not tainted by the fact that the case agent and the child's grandmother hugged the child after she indicated that she was sure of her identification of the defendant as her assailant.State v. Clark, 1986-NMCA-058, 104 N.M. 434, 722 P.2d 685, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 378, 721 P.2d 1309.\n\nHypnotically enhanced testimony.— Post-hypnotic recollections, revived by the hypnosis procedure, are only admissible in a trial where a proper foundation has also first established the expertise of the hypnotist and that the techniques employed were correctly performed, free from bias or suggestibility.State v. Clark, 1986-NMCA-058, 104 N.M. 434, 722 P.2d 685, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 378, 721 P.2d 1309.\n\nIf the trial court's determination that the identifications were not \"post-hypnotic recollections revived by hypnosis\" is supported by substantial evidence, then the requirements established byState v. Beachum, 1981-NMCA-137, 97 N.M. 682, 643 P.2d 246, were not triggered.State v. Clark, 1986-NMCA-058, 104 N.M. 434, 722 P.2d 685, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 378, 721 P.2d 1309.\n\nWhere no details of the incident were mentioned during the hypnotic sessions; no information was sought from the child, nor details suggested, but the only suggestion made was that the child should remember; and there was independent, objective verification of the facts presented by other witnesses, the child victim's in-court identification was not impermissibly tainted by the unproductive hypnotic session.State v. Clark, 1986-NMCA-058, 104 N.M. 434, 722 P.2d 685, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 378, 721 P.2d 1309.\n\nTestimony concerning post-traumatic stress disorder.— Testimony concerning post-traumatic stress disorder is admissible for establishing whether the alleged victim exhibits symptoms that are consistent with rape or sexual abuse.State v. Alberico, 1993-NMSC-047, 116 N.M. 156, 861 P.2d 192,rev'g1991-NMCA-112, 116 N.M. 178, 861 P.2d 219.\n\nTestimony concerning rape trauma syndrome.— Record did not suggest that the danger of unfair prejudice so outweighed the probative value of a witness's testimony concerning rape trauma syndrome as to require reversal in the absence of an objection, where there was little likelihood that the jury viewed the testimony as a \"diagnosis\" that the victim had been raped.State v. Barraza, 1990-NMCA-026, 110 N.M. 45, 791 P.2d 799, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 704, 789 P.2d 1271.\n\nTestimony concerning rape trauma syndrome is not admissible in a prosecution involving rape or sexual abuse.State v. Alberico, 1993-NMSC-047, 116 N.M. 156, 861 P.2d 192,rev'g1991-NMCA-112, 116 N.M. 178, 861 P.2d 219.\n\nFoot tracks.— Nonexpert evidence as to identity of accused, derived from a comparison of foot tracks with other tracks known to be those of accused, was admissible.State v. Ancheta, 1915-NMSC-003, 20 N.M. 19, 145 P. 1086.\n\nConfession admissible.— Where defendant, believing that prosecutrix had told of his relations with her, put himself under the protection of a third person and admitted to such person that he had slept with the prosecutrix, the confession was purely voluntary and admissible.State v. Whitener, 1918-NMSC-111, 25 N.M. 20, 175 P. 870.\n\nSuppression of evidence of rape trauma syndrome.— An order suppressing a psychologist's testimony relating to rape trauma syndrome was affirmed, where it could not be said that the trial court's order was clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances, and where there was no request to limit the evidence rather than exclude it altogether.State v. Bowman, 1986-NMCA-014, 104 N.M. 19, 715 P.2d 467.\n\nOrdinarily previous chastity of prosecuting witnessis immaterial in a statutory rape case.State v. Armijo, 1958-NMSC-108, 64 N.M. 431, 329 P.2d 785.\n\nPrior relations corroborative of statutory rape.— Evidence tending to show more than one act of criminal intercourse between accused and prosecutrix was admissible to show the relation and familiarity of the parties, and was corroborative of prosecutrix' testimony concerning the particular act relied upon for a conviction of statutory rape.State v. Whitener, 1918-NMSC-111, 25 N.M. 20, 175 P. 870.\n\nExclusion of evidence of prior rape and sexual conduct.— In prosecution for second degree criminal sexual penetration where theory of defense was that of fabrication of the rape and consensual intercourse, trial court properly excluded evidence of prior rape of victim and victim's prior sexual conduct.State v. Fish, 1984-NMSC-056, 101 N.M. 329, 681 P.2d 1106.\n\nPrevious intercourse admissible on issue of identity.— Exception to the rule that previous chastity of victim is immaterial might be where her pregnancy is shown and testimony given that defendant was father of the child, as there the testimony of prior sexual acts might be pertinent on rebuttal as tending to show that another might have been the cause of such condition.State v. Armijo, 1958-NMSC-108, 64 N.M. 431, 329 P.2d 785.\n\nPrevious intercourse not admissible on issue of penetration.— Trial court did not err in refusing to permit cross-examination of prosecuting witness in prosecution for statutory rape concerning prior acts of intercourse with other men, since the sole reason advanced by defendant's counsel for admissibility was on the issue of penetration, an issue about which there was no genuine controversy.State v. Armijo, 1958-NMSC-108, 64 N.M. 431, 329 P.2d 785.\n\nEvidence of defendant's vasectomy was probative of whether defendant committed the sexual assault as the victim described.— Where defendant was charged with criminal sexual penetration of an inmate, allegedly committed while defendant was employed as a corrections officer, and where, at trial, the district court admitted evidence regarding defendant's vasectomy over defendant's objection that the evidence was not relevant, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence because the serology report presented at trial identified the presence of semen, but no sperm on the victim's underwear, and additional evidence at trial established that a vasectomy is one reason why a semen sample might not contain sperm. Thus, evidence of defendant's vasectomy was probative of whether it was defendant's semen on the victim's underwear and whether he committed the sexual assault as the victim described.State v. Arvizo, 2021-NMCA-055, cert. denied.\n\nDefendant's occupation as police officer.— Evidence of the defendant's status as a police officer was material and relevant to the issue of whether he committed criminal sexual penetration in the third degree using his status as a police officer to force the victim to engage in fellatio or perform other delinquent acts.State v. Lucero, 1994-NMCA-129, 118 N.M. 696, 884 P.2d 1175, cert. denied, 118 N.M. 731, 885 P.2d 1325.\n\nB. INHERENT IMPROBABILITY.\n\nRule of inherent improbability.— Because of highly emotional and prejudicial elements present in cases of rape, supreme court has taken the position that over and above the substantial evidence rule applicable in appeals, it will review the evidence to determine whether or not it is so inherently improbable that, by conviction of the crime, a fundamental wrong has been done to defendant.State v. Shouse, 1953-NMSC-104, 57 N.M. 701, 262 P.2d 984.\n\nWhere defendant in prosecution for rape of a child contended that evidence was too vague and insufficient to establish guilt of defendant, appellate court would only weigh the evidence in the scales of inherent probability, and where there was substantial evidence tending to sustain the jury's verdict, its determination would be conclusive.State v. Till, 1967-NMSC-150, 78 N.M. 255, 430 P.2d 752, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 390 U.S. 713, 88 S. Ct. 1426, 20 L. Ed. 2d 254 (1968).\n\nWhere there was absolutely no evidence corroborating the prosecuting witness, and her evidence was outside the domain of reasonable probability, and accused denied the offense, a verdict of guilty was set aside and a new trial ordered.Mares v. Territory, 1901-NMSC-010, 10 N.M. 770, 65 P. 165.\n\nIn cases of common-law rape, where in the absence of such corroboration as outcries, torn and disarranged clothing, wounds or bruises, or if there is long delay in making complaint, the evidence is so inherently improbable as to be unsubstantial, unless there is other testimony which points unerringly to the defendant's guilt, an appellate court will not uphold a conviction.State v. Boyd, 1972-NMCA-120, 84 N.M. 290, 502 P.2d 315, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 271, 502 P.2d 296, and cert. denied, 411 U.S. 937, 93 S. Ct. 1916, 36 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1973) andreh'g denied, 412 U.S. 924, 93 S. Ct. 2739, 37 L. Ed. 2d 151 (1973).\n\nReversal since evidence improbable.— District court should, and supreme court would, examine the evidence in a rape case with great care to determine whether testimony of prosecuting witness was inherently improbable; and if so, in absence of some evidence of some fact unequivocally and unerringly pointing to the defendant's guilt, a conviction would not be permitted to stand.State v. Richardson, 1944-NMSC-059, 48 N.M. 544, 154 P.2d 224.\n\nDirected verdict.— Court was to instruct jury to find a verdict of not guilty on defendant's or its own motion when at the close of testimony in rape case insufficiently supported testimony of prosecuting witness was inherently improbable and a verdict based on it would constitute a miscarriage of justice.State v. Richardson, 1944-NMSC-059, 48 N.M. 544, 154 P.2d 224.\n\nRape not inherently improbable.— Testimony of examining physician that he found no evidence of trauma or injury to the vagina; that such lack of trauma is unusual in a rape case; that he found no other physical indication on the prosecutrix or her clothes that a rape had occurred; and that he found sperm in the vagina but that they were all immotile did not render the testimony of the prosecutrix inherently improbable.State v. Boyd, 1972-NMCA-120, 84 N.M. 290, 502 P.2d 315, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 271, 502 P.2d 296, and cert. denied, 411 U.S. 937, 93 S. Ct. 1916, 36 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1973), andreh'g denied, 412 U.S. 924, 93 S. Ct. 2739, 37 L. Ed. 2d 151 (1973).\n\nTime element.— Where the prosecutrix testified that she was raped twice by defendant and forced to commit an act of sodomy within a period of approximately 30 minutes, and in addition, there was some conversation between the prosecutrix and defendant during this time, it could not be said as a matter of law that the events described could not in fact have occurred during the period stated.State v. Boyd, 1972-NMCA-120, 84 N.M. 290, 502 P.2d 315, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 271, 502 P.2d 296, and cert. denied, 411 U.S. 937, 93 S. Ct. 1916, 36 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1973), andreh'g denied, 412 U.S. 924, 93 S. Ct. 2739, 37 L. Ed. 2d 151 (1973).\n\nInitial denial of sodomy.— Prosecutrix' denial that act of sodomy had occurred in first written statement to police and failure to mention it in second statement to police or to examining doctor did not render her testimony inherently improbable, where she explained that her denial and her failure to mention the act were the result of her embarrassment about it.State v. Boyd, 1972-NMCA-120, 84 N.M. 290, 502 P.2d 315, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 271, 502 P.2d 296, and cert. denied, 411 U.S. 937, 93 S. Ct. 1916, 36 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1973), andreh'g denied, 412 U.S. 924, 93 S. Ct. 2739, 37 L. Ed. 2d 151 (1973).\n\nUnusual circumstances not inherently improbable.— The uncorroborated testimony of a minor child competent to testify, unless there be something inherently improbable in it, is deemed substantial evidence and sufficient to uphold a conviction, and testimony which merely discloses unusual circumstances does not come within that category.State v. Trujillo, 1955-NMSC-094, 60 N.M. 277, 291 P.2d 315.\n\nRule inapplicable to sodomy.— The \"inherently improbable\" rule enunciated by the supreme court inState v. Shouse, 1953-NMSC-104, 57 N.M. 701, 262 P.2d 984, a rape case, is not applicable in cases of sodomy.State v. Kasakoff, 1972-NMCA-151, 84 N.M. 404, 503 P.2d 1182.\n\nC. CORROBORATION.\n\nBald charge insufficient.— In this jurisdiction, no corroboration of a prosecutrix by way of testimony of an independent character emanating from an outside source was required to sustain a conviction. But the bald charge of a woman against a man in that regard, unsupported and uncorroborated by facts and circumstances pointing to guilt of accused, was insufficient to meet requirement that verdict be supported by substantial evidence.State v. Boyd, 1972-NMCA-120, 84 N.M. 290, 502 P.2d 315, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 271, 502 P.2d 296, and cert. denied, 411 U.S. 937, 93 S. Ct. 1916, 36 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1973) andreh'g denied, 412 U.S. 924, 93 S. Ct. 2739, 37 L. Ed. 2d 151 (1973);State v. Armijo, 1920-NMSC-011, 25 N.M. 666, 187 P. 553.\n\nSurrounding facts as corroboration.— Testimony of prosecutrix required no corroboration except that surrounding facts and circumstances must have tended to establish truth of her testimony, but it need not have been evidence of an independent character, disconnected from her testimony.State v. Ellison, 1914-NMSC-076, 19 N.M. 428, 144 P. 10 (decided under prior law).\n\nOther witnesses not required.— Corroboration of prosecutrix' testimony by other witnesses as to particular acts constituting offense of rape was not required and an instruction to that effect would correctly state the law.State v. Richardson, 1944-NMSC-059, 48 N.M. 544, 154 P.2d 224.\n\nCorroboration in victim's complaint to mother.— In prosecution for rape, testimony of prosecuting witness was corroborated by proof of complaint made to her mother of the outrage committed upon her.Territory v. Edie, 1892-NMSC-019, 6 N.M. 555, 30 P. 851,aff'd on reh'g, 7 N.M. 183, 34 P. 46 (1893).\n\nDefendant's own actions corroborative.— Defendant's actions both preceding and following rape, including rather severely injuring nose and lip of prosecutrix, making of threats on way home, and fleeing even before any report was made to the police pointed unerringly to his guilt, and constituted corroborating circumstances of the truth of prosecutrix' story.State v. Ramirez, 1962-NMSC-042, 70 N.M. 54, 369 P.2d 973.\n\nCorroboration rule in rape cases was not applicable to sodomy.State v. Boyd, 1972-NMCA-120, 84 N.M. 290, 502 P.2d 315, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 271, 502 P.2d 296, 411 U.S. 937, 93 S. Ct. 1916, 36 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1973),reh'g denied, 412 U.S. 924, 93 S. Ct. 2739, 37 L. Ed. 2d 151 (1973) (decided under prior law).\n\nCorroboration rule not applicable to statutory rape.— In prosecutions for statutory rape, where consent was immaterial and force was not used, corroboration was not essential to a conviction, and it had only to be determined that the testimony of the prosecuting witness was not inherently improbable.State v. Trujillo, 1955-NMSC-094, 60 N.M. 277, 291 P.2d 315.\n\nCorroboration was not required in cases of statutory rape because the usual concomitant facts present in common-law rape, such as torn and disarranged clothing, wounds or bruises, outcries, etc., neither necessarily nor ordinarily appear.State v. Trujillo, 1955-NMSC-094, 60 N.M. 277, 291 P.2d 315.\n\nUncorroborated testimony of child.— The uncorroborated testimony of a minor child competent to testify, unless there be something inherently improbable in it, is deemed substantial evidence and sufficient to uphold a conviction.State v. Trujillo, 1955-NMSC-094, 60 N.M. 277, 291 P.2d 315.\n\nIn statutory sex offenses against a young victim corroboration of the claim that the defendant is the guilty party is not necessary where the evidence of guilt is substantial.State v. Montoya, 1957-NMSC-015, 62 N.M. 173, 306 P.2d 1095.\n\nIndependent of statute, a man could be convicted of rape upon the uncorroborated evidence of a strumpet or a girl under the age of ten years.State v. Ellison, 1914-NMSC-076, 19 N.M. 428, 144 P. 10.\n\nInstruction properly refused.— As no corroboration of prosecutrix was necessary to uphold conviction, a requested instruction on subject of corroboration, contrary to the rule, was properly refused.State v. Whitener, 1918-NMSC-111, 25 N.M. 20, 175 P. 870.\n\nAbsence of corroboration.— In rape prosecution, where prosecutrix was not corroborated, evidence was insufficient, for want of such corroboration, to sustain conviction.State v. Clevenger, 1921-NMSC-097, 27 N.M. 466, 202 P. 687.\n\nIn cases of common-law rape, in the absence of such corroboration as outcries, torn and disarranged clothing, wounds or bruises, or if there is long delay in making complaint, the evidence might be so inherently improbable as to be unsubstantial, and would not uphold a conviction.State v. Shults, 1938-NMSC-070, 43 N.M. 71, 85 P.2d 591.\n\nD. SUFFICIENCY.\n\nJury's function.— It is the jury's function in a rape case to judge the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony.State v. White, 1967-NMSC-016, 77 N.M. 488, 424 P.2d 402.\n\nThe jury was to determine how much incriminating circumstances were weakened by contrary characterizations, more or less plausible, or by other facts having an opposite tendency in the evidence.State v. Godwin, 1947-NMSC-016, 51 N.M. 65, 178 P.2d 584.\n\nVictim's age for jury.— Whether prosecutrix was under the age of consent was a jury question.State v. Whitener, 1918-NMSC-111, 25 N.M. 20, 175 P. 870.\n\nSufficient evidence of criminal sexual penetration of a minor under thirteen where there were inconsistencies as to the victim's age.— Where, on direct and cross-examination, victim testified that defendant had not digitally penetrated her until after she turned thirteen years old, but on redirect examination, after having her recollection refreshed, testified that defendant had penetrated her when she was twelve years old, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that defendant committed criminal sexual penetration of a minor under thirteen. Although the victim's testimony on redirect contradicted her testimony on direct and cross-examination, it is the exclusive province of the jury to resolve factual inconsistencies in a witness's testimony.State v. Little, 2020-NMCA-040.\n\nProof of penetrationalone was sufficient to establish the crime of statutory rape.State v. Harbert, 1915-NMSC-023, 20 N.M. 179, 147 P. 280.\n\nSufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction for criminal sexual penetration of a minor.— There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for criminal sexual penetration of a minor where the state was required to prove that defendant caused the insertion to any extent of his penis into the vagina and/or vulva of the child victim, that the child was under the age of thirteen, and this happened in New Mexico, and where the state presented evidence from the child's sister that she saw defendant attempting to insert his penis into the child's vagina and that, afterwards, the child complained that her vagina was hurting; the jury could rationally have found that the child's vagina hurt because defendant had inserted his penis into the vagina and/or vulva of the child \"to any extent.\"State v. Bahr, 2024-NMCA-075, cert. denied.\n\nProsecution for attempted CSPM was timely because defendant's absence from the state tolled the statute of limitations.— Where defendant was convicted of one count of criminal sexual penetration of a minor (CSPM) and two counts of attempted CSPM, and where defendant claimed that one of his convictions for attempted CSPM was barred by the statute of limitations because the charging period included time that fell outside the six-year limitations period, the statute of limitations did not bar the state from prosecuting defendant, because the state presented evidence that defendant left New Mexico and moved to Arizona and was still living in Arizona when he was originally charged. Consequently, the statute of limitations for prosecuting defendant for attempted CSPM was tolled when defendant left New Mexico and while he was residing in Arizona.State v. Bahr, 2024-NMCA-075, cert. denied.\n\nPenetration provable from circumstances.— Proof of penetration was essential to conviction of having carnally known and abused a minor child, but it was not necessary that it be proved by direct evidence; it might be established by circumstantial evidence.State v. Godwin, 1947-NMSC-016, 51 N.M. 65, 178 P.2d 584.\n\nOpportunity and physical condition.— Proof of carnal knowledge could be adequately shown by fact that opportunity for sexual intercourse existed and that physical condition of the child showed abuse.State v. Godwin, 1947-NMSC-016, 51 N.M. 65, 178 P.2d 584.\n\nA decedent constitutes a \"person\" for purposes of this section.— Where defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and third-degree criminal sexual penetration (CSP), based on defendant's admission that he killed the victim and then had sexual intercourse with the victim after she died, but where defendant argued that the statute requires that the victim be alive at the time of penetration, defendant was properly convicted of CSP because the purpose of the CSP statute is to protect against forcible, nonconsensual sexual penetration of a person's body and the legislative intent underlying CSP is the protection of people from unlawful intrusions into enumerated areas of the body, and it would be contrary to the spirit of the statute to exclude victims who were unable to consent or resist solely because the perpetrator rendered the victim permanently unconscious by killing the victim.State v. Martinez, 2021-NMSC-012.\n\nThe state sufficiently established the corpus delicti of CSP.— Where defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and third-degree criminal sexual penetration (CSP), based on defendant's admission that he killed the victim and then had sexual intercourse with the victim after she died, and where defendant argued that the corpus delicti rule requires the state to produce some evidence that a crime has been committed in addition to extrajudicial confessions or admissions of the accused to support a conviction, the state sufficiently established the corpus delicti of CSP because a defendant's extrajudicial statements may be used to establish the corpus delicti when the prosecution is able to demonstrate the trustworthiness of the confessions and introduce some independent evidence of a criminal act, and in this case, the postmortem condition and location of the victim's body was sufficient to corroborate the truthfulness of defendant's statements.State v. Martinez, 2021-NMSC-012.\n\nEvidence of penetration sufficient.— Where child's parent discovered a bruise on the child's labia immediately after the child had been in defendant's care; a linear abrasion went deep into the child's vagina; two photographs of the bruise were admitted into evidence; the child told four people that defendant had pinched the child's \"cha-cha\" and illustrated the statement by pulling on the child's labia; and the bruise was consistent with being pinched, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of criminal sexual penetration by penetration.State v. Massengill, 2003-NMCA-024, 133 N.M. 263, 62 P.3d 354, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 126, 61 P.3d 835.\n\nTestimony of doctor who examined victim, a minor child under the age of 13, in the evening of the day of alleged act of sodomy, that there had been a penetration into boy's anus, along with child's testimony as to the assault and as to the pain experienced by him as a result thereof, was sufficient evidence of penetration for jury's consideration.State v. Mase, 1965-NMSC-134, 75 N.M. 542, 407 P.2d 874.\n\nSufficient evidence to prove a pattern of conduct of criminal sexual penetration of a minor.— Where defendant was charged with twelve counts of criminal sexual penetration of a minor, and where the two children testified to a pattern of conduct where defendant would put his penis and fingers in each child's vagina and anus before she went to school in the mornings, and where the children further testified that defendant did this more than six times, with one instance tied to the first day of school, but where no other evidence tied an incident to a certain time or place, the undifferentiated multiple acts against a victim within a period of time is evidence sufficient to support a conviction on one count per child for a pattern of conduct of criminal sexual penetration of a minor.State v. Huerta-Castro, 2017-NMCA-026.\n\nSufficient evidence of aiding and abetting.— Evidence that defendant ordered the victims to perform fellatio on particular individuals and threatened the victims with grave bodily harm if they failed to do so and that defendant assisted in creating the atmosphere of intimidation which convinced the victims that the threats would be carried out, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of accessory to criminal sexual penetration.State v. Perez, 2002-NMCA-040, 132 N.M. 84, 44 P.3d 530, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 83, 44 P.3d 529.\n\nEvidence sufficient to sustain conviction.— Where defendant was convicted for criminal sexual penetration in the second degree which resulted in the pregnancy of the victim; the victim testified that defendant impregnated the victim when the victim was fourteen years old while the victim and the victim's family were living with defendant, that the victim felt compelled to have sex with defendant because defendant was an authority figure, that the sex was not consensual, and that defendant told the victim that if the victim reported the sexual intercourse, defendant would kill the victim and the victim's family; and a forensic DNA analyst testified that DNA samples from defendant, the victim, and the victim's child showed that defendant fathered the victim's child, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction.State v. Fierro, 2014-NMCA-004, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nWhere the child, who was six years old, testified that defendant put defendant's hand underneath the child's underwear, touched the child's vagina, and performed cunnilingus on the child; and the doctor who performed a SANE examination of the child testified that the child told the doctor that defendant had inserted defendant's fingers into the child's vagina; and the doctor's examination of the child revealed injuries to the child's vagina that were consistent with penetration by a finger or other object, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of criminal sexual penetration of a minor.State v. Skinner, 2011-NMCA-070, 150 N.M. 26, 256 P.3d 969, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.\n\nThe prosecutrix' testimony, which was not inherently improbable and which was corroborated by facts and circumstances, pointed unerringly to defendant and was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction.State v. Boyd, 1972-NMCA-120, 84 N.M. 290, 502 P.2d 315, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 271, 502 P.2d 296, and cert. denied, 411 U.S. 937, 93 S. Ct. 1916, 36 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1973) andreh'g denied, 412 U.S. 924, 93 S. Ct. 2739, 37 L. Ed. 2d 151 (1973).\n\nEvidence consisting of the testimony of the victim's counselor and the victim herself was sufficient to support convictions of criminal sexual contact with a minor and criminal sexual penetration of a minor.State v. Ortiz-Burciaga, 1999-NMCA-146, 128 N.M. 382, 993 P.2d 96, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 149, 990 P.2d 823.\n\nWhen evidence as a whole left no doubt as to fact of intercourse and penetration, it was sufficient, even though if certain questions addressed to complaining witness with their answers alone were considered, there might have been some doubt as to sufficiency of proof.State v. Alva, 1913-NMSC-056, 18 N.M. 143, 134 P. 209.\n\nAppellate court found no ground to disturb verdict of guilty where after sifting from any recitation of facts made to support claim that 11 year old prosecutrix' testimony was inherently improbable, all facts and inferences which verdict resolves against defendant, there remains testimony of a substantial character sufficient to support the conviction.State v. Trujillo, 1955-NMSC-094, 60 N.M. 277, 291 P.2d 315.\n\nAn appellate court will not disturb the verdict of the jury if the victim's testimony was sufficiently credible for a conviction.State v. Nichols, 2006-NMCA-017, 139 N.M. 72, 128 P.3d 500.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of numerous counts of criminal sexual penetration of a minor perpetrated on his eight-year-old daughter and four-year-old stepdaughter; the child victims' testimony that the nature of defendant's acts involved physical interaction that was skin to skin, that defendant rubbed or repetitiously slid his finger upon each child's unclothed genital openings, the requirement that penetration minimally occur to any extent was met, and where eight-year-old victim testified that defendant put his penis \"where I go poop\" and that it \"actually went in\", was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for criminal sexual penetration of a minor, and where eight-year-old child victim's testimony established that defendant's repeated movements of his penis against her unclothed genitalia prior to emission penetrated the labia major to the slightest extent or beyond, met the penetrative element of criminal sexual penetration of a minor; there was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that defendant committed the acts of criminal sexual penetration.State v. Tapia, 2015-NMCA-048, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-004.\n\nEvidence was sufficient to prove that defendant knew that the victim was unable to consent to sexual intercourse.— Where defendant was charged with criminal sexual penetration in the third degree (CSP), and where, at trial, the jury was instructed that to find defendant guilty of CSP by force or coercion, it must find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant caused the victim to engage in sexual intercourse, the victim was unconscious, asleep or physically helpless, and defendant knew or had reason to know of the victim's condition, and where, at trial, defendant admitted to engaging in sexual intercourse with the victim, the victim testified that she had consumed alcohol, was \"making out\" with another person, and then \"blacked out\" and did not remember anything that happened from the time she started making out with the other person until she \"came to\" in defendant's bedroom to find the other person and defendant having sex with her, and a toxicologist testified that the amount of alcohol and other substances the victim had in her body that night and the effect of those substances on the victim at the time of the incident could cause excessive sleeping, confusion, and difficulties with memory or speaking, there was sufficient evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, to permit a rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of CSP beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Moreno-Ortiz, 2022-NMCA-059, cert. denied.\n\nRetrial was not barred where there was substantial evidence of defendant's guilt under the invalid jury instructions.— Where defendant was charged with two counts of criminal sexual penetration of a minor in the second degree (CSPM-II) based on the state's theory that defendant used his position of authority to coerce the victim to submit to the sexual act, and where the district court instructed the jury using an inapplicable uniform jury instruction that omitted the essential element of \"force or coercion\", retrial was not barred where there was substantial evidence of defendant's guilt under the given instructions where the jury could reasonably have concluded that the victim had been coerced into lying still while defendant perpetrated fellatio, a symptom of the undue influence that defendant's position as the victim's father enabled him to exercise.State v. Figueroa, 2020-NMCA-007, cert. denied.\n\nSufficient evidence of criminal sexual penetration of a minor for purposes of retrial.— Where defendant was convicted of one count of criminal sexual penetration of a minor and twenty-one counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor, and where defendant's convictions were overturned based on the state's violation of defendant's constitutional right against self-incrimination, there was sufficient evidence to support each of defendant's convictions for purposes of retrial where, at trial, the state presented evidence from the child victim that defendant committed multiple instances of criminal sexual contact and at least one instance of criminal sexual penetration over a four-month period and defendant's admission that he had put the child's penis in his mouth at least once and had touched the child's penis between twenty and thirty times.State v. Atencio, 2021-NMCA-061,aff'd in partandrev'd in partby 2024-NMSC-022.\n\nSufficient evidence of great mental anguish.— Where defendant was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual penetration (CSP), and where defendant claimed that the state failed to establish that the victim suffered great mental anguish as a result of the incident and that the evidence is therefore insufficient to support his conviction for first-degree CSP, evidence that the victim was over seventy years of age, that she moved to another state to live with her daughter because she felt unable to live alone, that she experienced constant flashbacks, and as a result had trouble concentrating and was unable to drive for a period of time, was sufficient to support a conclusion that the victim suffered great mental anguish as a result of the incident.State v. Sena, 2018-NMCA-037,rev'd in part by2020-NMSC-011.\n\nSufficient evidence of second-degree criminal sexual penetration perpetrated in the commission of a felony.— Where defendant was convicted of criminal sexual penetration in the commission of a felony and first-degree kidnapping, the jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant took or transported the victim by deception based on the victim's testimony that he got into defendant's truck because defendant said that he would take the victim home, that defendant confined the victim by force based on the victim's testimony that when he tried to escape from defendant's truck, the door was locked, that defendant intended to hold the victim against his will to inflict a sexual offense against him based on the victim's testimony that defendant took him to a remote location, pulled down his pants, and then penetrated his anus, that defendant transported the victim to a remote location and confined him there for the purpose of inflicting a sexual offense on him based on defendant's statement upon completion of the sexual act, \"Now I can take you home,\" that defendant's act against the victim was unlawful because the jury could have inferred that it was done without the victim's consent and for the purpose of gratifying defendant's sexual desire or to intrude upon the victim's bodily safety or integrity. There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions.State v. Samora, 2016-NMSC-031.\n\nSufficient evidence of criminal sexual penetration based on the commission of a felony.— Where defendant offered a ride home to a fifteen year old boy, but instead took the boy back to defendant's apartment where defendant offered the boy beer and cocaine, which were consumed by the boy, and where defendant then proceeded to perform oral sex on the boy and prior to taking the boy home the defendant asked the boy for anal sex, which the boy complied with because he was afraid that if he did not he would be anally penetrated, and where, at trial, a forensic examiner testified that she identified saliva that contained defendant's DNA on the inside of the victim's boxer shorts, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions for distribution of a controlled substance to a minor, CSP II, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.State v. Simmons, 2018-NMCA-015, cert. denied.\n\nRape established.— Where the evidence establishes that defendant had sexual intercourse with a female without her consent and by forcibly overcoming her resistance, this was rape, regardless of the age of the victim.State v. Garcia, 1967-NMSC-140, 78 N.M. 136, 429 P.2d 334.\n\nConviction for rape not barred by facts also establishing statutory rape.State v. Garcia, 1967-NMSC-140, 78 N.M. 136, 429 P.2d 334.\n\nRape of child.— In prosecution for rape of child, statement of 9 year old prosecutrix and testimony of examining doctor expressing opinion that child had undergone sexual intercourse as late as the day charged constituted substantial evidence and met test of inherent probability.State v. Till, 1967-NMSC-150, 78 N.M. 255, 430 P.2d 752, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 390 U.S. 713, 88 S. Ct. 1426, 20 L. Ed. 2d 254 (1968).\n\nWhen testimony of prosecuting witness, a child of between twelve and thirteen, was convincing, was not inherently improbable, was unshaken by cross-examination and was corroborated by the mother, and, up to a certain point, by defendant, it was sufficient to sustain a conviction of statutory rape.State v. Keener, 1938-NMSC-073, 43 N.M. 94, 85 P.2d 748.\n\nSpouses living apart.— Evidence supported finding that defendant and his wife were living apart at the time of the attack, where the wife testified that she felt she was living apart from defendant at the time of the attack, and there was evidence of the couple's physical separation and the defendant's securing other housing and paying one month's rent.Brecheisen v. Mondragon, 833 F.2d 238 (10th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1011, 108 S. Ct. 1479, 99 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1988).\n\nAttempted sodomy.— Acts of defendant constituted an active effort to consummate crime of sodomy and were more than mere preparation, where in addition to his announced intention to \"screw\" 16 year old victim, defendant beat victim until he passed out and removed victim's clothes, during course of which events the fly on defendant's pants was open.State v. Trejo, 1972-NMCA-019, 83 N.M. 511, 494 P.2d 173.\n\nIV. DEFENSES.\n\nA. CONSENT.\n\nConsent is not a defense when victim is a statutorily defined child.— The consent of a statutorily defined child is legally irrelevant to the unlawfulness element for both criminal sexual penetration charges.State v. Moore, 2011-NMCA-089, 150 N.M. 512, 263 P.3d 289, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-008, 268 P.3d 513.\n\nWhere the victim was fourteen years of age; defendant was forty-six years of age; the victim voluntarily agreed to have sex with defendant; and defendant was charged with criminal sexual penetration in the second degree and criminal sexual penetration in the fourth degree, the state did not improperly instruct the grand jury on the unlawfulness element for the charges when the state omitted language that the act must have been done \"without consent\" of the victim, because the consent of a statutorily defined child is legally irrelevant to the unlawfulness element of both charges.State v. Moore, 2011-NMCA-089, 150 N.M. 512, 263 P.3d 289, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-008, 268 P.3d 513.\n\nAbsence of consent not element of criminal sexual penetration.— Although absence of consent was an element of the rape statute, which has now been repealed, absence of consent is not an element of the crime of criminal sexual penetration as defined by the legislature.State v. Jiminez, 1976-NMCA-096, 89 N.M. 652, 556 P.2d 60;State v. Gillette, 1985-NMCA-037, 102 N.M. 695, 699 P.2d 626.\n\nAbsence of consent not element of statutory rape.— Under former law, where intercourse was with a girl under age of 16 the state need have proved only that defendant indulged in intercourse with her, regardless of question of her consent.State v. Richardson, 1944-NMSC-059, 48 N.M. 544, 154 P.2d 224.\n\nAbsence of consent not required for rape.— Under former law, where victim was over age of consent, it was necessary to prove intercourse against her will.State v. Richardson, 1944-NMSC-059, 48 N.M. 544, 154 P.2d 224.\n\nAs was resistance.— To constitute the crime of rape of one over the age of consent, there must be resistance, and it must be forcibly overcome; it was not sufficient that the carnal act was violently accomplished, or that it was without her consent.Mares v. Territory, 1901-NMSC-010, 10 N.M. 770, 65 P. 165 (decided under prior law).\n\nAmount of resistance required of victim depended upon the factsof the particular case. Resistance may be overcome by fear induced by threats as by physical violence.State v. White, 1967-NMSC-016, 77 N.M. 488, 424 P.2d 402 (decided under prior law).\n\nViolent injury indicative of adequate resistance.— Less than satisfactory evidence of resistance would not warrant reversal of rape conviction where the physical violence done to the prosecutrix and her resultant injuries therefrom tend to show that further resistance would have been of no avail and perhaps would have resulted in more serious injuries to her.State v. Ramirez, 1962-NMSC-042, 70 N.M. 54, 369 P.2d 973 (decided under prior law).\n\nThreats overcoming resistance.— Fact that threats by which prosecutrix' resistance had been overcome were made by someone other than the defendant was immaterial.State v. Barnett, 1973-NMCA-098, 85 N.M. 404, 512 P.2d 977 (decided under prior law).\n\nConsent inconsistent with evidence.— Evidence that prosecutrix' clothes were torn, that she suffered a scratch or cut on the side of her head which bled during the preliminary hearing, that immediately after the assault various witnesses noticed red welts or marks, on prosecutrix' throat and that her bedroom was in disarray, was inconsistent with sexual intercourse by consent.State v. White, 1967-NMSC-016, 77 N.M. 488, 424 P.2d 402.\n\nConsensual sex.— Accused will not be convicted for engaging in purely consensual sex.State v. Maestas, 2005-NMCA-062, 137 N.M. 477, 112 P.3d 1134,rev'd on other grounds, 2007-NMSC-001, 140 N.M. 836, 149 P.3d 933.\n\nB. IMPOTENCY.\n\nAssault with intent to rape.— Impotency could be shown but was not a complete defense to charge of assault with intent to rape.State v. Ballamah, 1922-NMSC-057, 28 N.M. 212, 210 P. 391.\n\nForce was not element of crime of sodomy under former law.Washington v. Rodriguez, 1971-NMCA-021, 82 N.M. 428, 483 P.2d 309 (decided under prior law).\n\nConsent no defense.— Under former law, consent of both parties to the act of sodomy did not constitute a defense to that crime.Washington v. Rodriguez, 1971-NMCA-021, 82 N.M. 428, 483 P.2d 309 (decided under prior law).\n\nEmission was not necessary element of crime of sodomy.State v. Massey, 1954-NMSC-018, 58 N.M. 115, 266 P.2d 359 (decided under prior law).\n\nEach act distinct.— Since under former 40A-9-6, 1953 Comp., \"any penetration\" could complete the crime of sodomy, on its face the statute clearly allowed prosecution for different kinds or acts of sodomy. State v. Elliott, 1977-NMSC-002, 89 N.M. 756, 557 P.2d 1105.\n\nCunnilingus and fellatio.— Under former 40A-9-6, 1953 Comp., sodomy included a taking into the mouth \"the sexual organ of any other person\"; the statute was not limited to the sexual organ of the male, \"any other person\" including both male and female.State v. Putman, 1967-NMCA-020, 78 N.M. 552, 434 P.2d 77 (decided under prior law).\n\nWhere former statute (Laws 1876, ch. 34, § 1) provided a penalty for crime of sodomy, but did not define the term, the common-law definition would apply; hence, sexual copulation per os or fellatio, was not included in the offense of sodomy.Bennett v. Abram, 1953-NMSC-013, 57 N.M. 28, 253 P.2d 316 (discharging petitioners in habeas corpus proceeding where they pleaded guilty to charge of sodomy without proper advice as to nature of the crime) (decided under prior law).\n\nAiding and abetting shown.— It was not necessary that the state prove that defendant aided and abetted a particular act of sodomy, as his presence at the scene and active participation in the criminal conduct being undertaken, in such a way as to encourage the commission of the charged offenses, was enough to constitute aiding and abetting.State v. Barnett, 1973-NMCA-098, 85 N.M. 404, 512 P.2d 977.\n\nVI. INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nUse of wrong alternative in uniform instruction.— Where defendant was charged with first degree criminal sexual penetration of a minor for vaginal penetration and first degree criminal sexual penetration of a minor for anal penetration; the court instructed the jury that the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant \"caused the insertion to any extent, of a penis into the vagina and/or vulva\" of the victim and that the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant \"caused the insertion to any extent, of a penis into the anus\" of the victim; and although the court erred in using the second alternative of the uniform instruction as the form of the instructions given to the jury, the instructions as given accurately reflected the statutory law and did not constitute reversible error.State v. Tafoya, 2010-NMCA-010, 147 N.M. 602, 227 P.3d 92, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-012, 147 N.M. 600, 227 P.3d 90.\n\nEssential elements of crime.— A jury must be instructed on the essential elements of the crime charged, and failure so to do is fundamental error because the error is jurisdictional and thus not harmless.State v. Kendall, 1977-NMCA-002, 90 N.M. 236, 561 P.2d 935,rev'd in part, 1977-NMSC-015, 90 N.M. 191, 561 P.2d 464, (holding that under the circumstances an instruction that victim must not be defendant's spouse, was not necessary) (decided under prior law).\n\nEssential elements of second-degree criminal sexual penetration in the commission of a felony.— If unlawfulness is at issue, then lack of consent is an essential element of criminal sexual penetration perpetrated in the commission of a felony.State v. Samora, 2016-NMSC-031.\n\nIn defendant's trial for second-degree criminal sexual penetration perpetrated in the commission of a felony (CSP-felony), where the jury instruction at issue reflected UJI 14-132 NMRA, except that it failed to include the bracketed phrase \"without consent,\" which would have clarified that any sexual contact between the victim and defendant had to be non-consensual for the jury to determine that defendant's act was unlawful, it was fundamental error to omit the element of consent from the jury instructions that were relevant to CSP-felony, because unlawfulness was at issue and the jurors may have been confused or misdirected as to whether defendant could have still acted unlawfully if the victim had consented to sex.State v. Samora, 2016-NMSC-031.\n\nCriminal sexual penetration based on the commission of a felony.— When criminal sexual penetration is based on the commission of a felony, it must be a felony that is committed against the victim of, and that assists in the accomplishment of, sexual penetration perpetrated by force or coercion or against a victim who, by age or other statutory factor, gave no lawful consent.State v. Simmons, 2018-NMCA-015, cert. denied.\n\nNo fundamental error where instruction on CSP-II felony failed to instruct on causal link between the felony committed and the CSP.— In defendant's trial for criminal sexual penetration (CSP II) based on the commission of a felony, where the jury was instructed that the state must prove defendant caused the victim to engage in fellatio and anal intercourse, and defendant committed the acts during the commission of kidnapping or distribution of a controlled substance to a minor or contributing to the delinquency of a minor, but was not instructed to find that the associated felony must be committed against the victim of and assist in the accomplishment of the CSP, the jury instruction was deficient but did not rise to the level of fundamental error, because a reasonable jury would not be confused by the instruction, and the connection between the associated felonies and the acts of CSP II was so apparent that the CSP II-felony convictions did not shock the judicial conscience.State v. Simmons, 2018-NMCA-015, cert. denied.\n\nIntent instruction for felony underlying second-degree CSP was proper.— Where defendant was convicted of fourth-degree criminal sexual penetration of a minor and second-degree criminal sexual penetration of a minor, perpetrated during the commission of a felony, and where defendant claimed that the jury instruction on giving alcohol to a minor, the felony underlying his second-degree criminal sexual penetration conviction, was defective because it omitted the mens rea of the offense, whether he knew giving alcohol to a minor was unlawful, fundamental error did not occur with the given instruction, which set forth the proper mens rea for giving alcohol to a minor, whether defendant knew or had reason to know that the recipient of the alcohol was a minor.State v. Muller, 2022-NMCA-024, cert. denied.\n\nFundamental error occurred where jury convicted defendant on an invalid legal theory.— Where defendant was charged with two counts of criminal sexual penetration of a minor in the second degree (CSPM-II) based on the state's theory that defendant used his position of authority to coerce the victim to submit to the sexual act, and where the district court instructed the jury using an inapplicable uniform jury instruction that omitted the essential element of \"force or coercion\", fundamental error occurred because the given instructions would have confused or misled a reasonable juror and it was a miscarriage of justice to convict defendant of \"position of authority\" CSPM-II because that crime did not exist at the time the CSPM at issue was alleged to have occurred.State v. Figueroa, 2020-NMCA-007, cert. denied.\n\nInstruction in language of statute.— An instruction which set forth the elements of the crime of second degree criminal sexual penetration in the language of the statute was sufficient, and there was no error in failing to instruct on absence of the victim's consent.State v. Jiminez, 1976-NMCA-096, 89 N.M. 652, 556 P.2d 60.\n\nReading of statute permissible.— In prosecution for rape though there was no evidence tending to show that the prosecuting witness, through idiocy, imbecility or unsoundness of mind, either temporary or permanent, was incapable of giving consent, it was not error for the court, in its instructions, to read the entire section to the jury.Territory v. Edie, 1892-NMSC-019, 6 N.M. 555, 30 P. 851,aff'd on reh'g, 1893-NMSC-016, 7 N.M. 183, 34 P. 46.\n\nInstruction constituting constructive amendment of information.— Jury instruction which allowed for conviction based on digital penetration occurring prior to the enactment of this section constituted a constructive amendment of the information which required reversal.Hunter v. New Mexico, 916 F.2d 595 (10th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 909, 111 S. Ct. 1693, 114 L. Ed. 2d 87 (1991).\n\nInstruction on personal injury.— In a prosecution for criminal sexual penetration, where the trial court gave the statutory definition of personal injury appearing at 30-9-10C NMSA 1978, and also gave the statutory definition of great bodily harm at 30-1-12A NMSA 1978 in the instruction on first degree criminal sexual penetration, the lack of additional definition of personal injury was not error; if defendant desired that personal injury be further defined, he should have submitted a requested instruction to that effect, and since he did not do so, he could not complain of the lack of additional definition of the term.State v. Jiminez, 1976-NMCA-096, 89 N.M. 652, 556 P.2d 60.\n\nFailure to give charge of offense in third degree.— Failure to give defendant's tendered charge on criminal sexual penetration in the third degree was reversible error at his trial for false imprisonment and criminal sexual penetration in the second degree, where the jury could find from the evidence that the sexual intercourse occurred by coercion or force, but without the requisite elements of false imprisonment as an independent felony.State v. Corneau, 1989-NMCA-040, 109 N.M. 81, 781 P.2d 1159, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 668, 777 P.2d 907.\n\nVictim other than spouse.— Where there was no evidence whatsoever that the victim raped, sodomized and killed was the spouse of the defendant, failure to instruct the jury that it must find that the victim was not defendant's wife in the rape conviction was not a jurisdictional error.State v. Melton, 1977-NMSC-014, 90 N.M. 188, 561 P.2d 461 (decided under prior law).\n\nReversal of defendant's conviction of criminal sexual penetration because of trial court's failure to instruct that jury must find that victim was other than defendant's spouse was improper under facts of the case, and defendant was properly convicted of criminal sexual penetration.Kendall v. State, 1977-NMSC-015, 90 N.M. 191, 561 P.2d 464 (decided under prior law).\n\nIdentical instructions on multiple counts.— Where the jury was given identical instructions on two counts of attempted criminal sexual penetration that were alleged to have occurred over a three week period and the victim testified that defendant attempted to force the victim to perform fellatio four times on different evenings; and the victim described intervening events between the attempted acts of fellatio, defendant's acts were not unitary and the instructions did not violate the double jeopardy clause.State v. Dombos, 2008-NMCA-035, 143 N.M. 668, 180 P.3d 675, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-002, 143 N.M. 666, 180 P.3d 673.\n\nInstructions on aiding and abetting.— Circumstantial evidence that defendant knew that throughout defendant's companion forced the victim to commit various sexual acts; that on several occasions during the night at the companion's request, defendant brought coffee and cigarettes to the companion in the bedroom; and that defendant had a knife in defendant's belt was sufficient to support an instruction that the jury could convict defendant if defendant aided and abetted the companion in the commission of criminal sexual penetration.State v. Duncan, 1990-NMCA-063, 113 N.M. 637, 830 P.2d 554,aff'd, 1991-NMSC-010, 111 N.M. 354, 805 P.2d 621.\n\nLesser included offenses.— In trial of Indian for rape under the federal Major Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 1153, 3242, conferring federal jurisdiction over certain enumerated major crimes committed by Indians on Indian reservations), it was reversible error for trial court to refuse to instruct on the non-enumerated offenses of attempted rape, simple assault and battery, all of which were lesser included offenses under New Mexico law.Joe v. United States, 510 F.2d 1038 (10th Cir. 1974).\n\nLesser included offense instruction.— Any variance between the victim's testimony at trial and her testimony before the grand jury was insufficient to require an instruction on a lesser included offense, where defendant's own testimony that he had no contact of any sort with the victim negated the possibility that such an instruction might have been warranted.Chavez v. Kerby, 848 F.2d 1101 (10th Cir. 1988).\n\nLesser included offenses and alibi.— Because the defendant offered the defense of an alibi, he was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction on the ground that the jury might have rejected the part of the complainant's testimony regarding the use of a gun.State v. Wilson, 1993-NMCA-074, 117 N.M. 11, 868 P.2d 656, cert. quashed, 119 N.M. 311, 889 P.2d 1233 (1995).\n\nCharge on third degree not warranted.— Where there was no evidence tending to establish that the criminal sexual penetration was committed by force or coercion without resultant personal injury, since the only evidence was that defendant used force which resulted in personal injury, beating the victim with his fists, twisting her breasts and pulling her hair immediately prior to sexual intercourse, there was no evidence supporting an instruction on third degree criminal sexual penetration.State v. Jiminez, 1976-NMCA-096, 89 N.M. 652, 556 P.2d 60.\n\nInstruction on consent properly refused.— Where a review of the record and a thorough examination of the prosecutrix' testimony does not ever raise a slight inference of consent on part of victim, it was not error for trial court to deny defendant's requested instruction on consent as a defense.State v. Armstrong, 1973-NMCA-081, 85 N.M. 234, 511 P.2d 560, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 228, 511 P.2d 554,overruled on other grounds byState v. Elliott, 1975-NMCA-087, 88 N.M. 187, 539 P.2d 207.\n\nThe district court did not err in denying proposed jury instruction on the age of consent.— Where defendant was charged with criminal sexual penetration of a minor (CSPM) for digitally penetrating the vagina of a sixteen-year-old female by force or coercion, and where, at trial, the jury was instructed that to convict defendant of CSPM, it must conclude that the charged act was unlawful, and the jury was also erroneously instructed that for the act to have been unlawful it must have been done without consent, and where defendant, arguing that because consent was put in issue, the jury should have been instructed on the age of consent in New Mexico, the district court did not err in denying defendant's requested instruction, because defendant's theory of the case was not that the victim consented, but that he never penetrated her, and no evidence of consent to digital penetration was presented during the trial. Moreover, if the prosecution has proved that force or coercion was used by the perpetrator, it has also necessarily proved that the act was non-consensual, and a separate finding of a lack of consent is not required; providing an instruction on the matter would have served only to suggest that the jury had to determine a fact not in issue.State v. Cebada, 2024-NMCA-023, cert. denied.\n\nThe district court did not coerce the jury into rendering a verdict by refusing to answer the jury's question regarding the age of consent.— Where defendant was charged with criminal sexual penetration of a minor (CSPM) for digitally penetrating the vagina of a sixteen-year-old female by force or coercion, and where, at trial, the jury was instructed that to convict defendant of CSPM, it must conclude that the charged act was unlawful, and the jury was also erroneously instructed that for the act to have been unlawful it must have been done without consent, and where, during deliberations, the jury indicated that it was confused about the age of consent in New Mexico, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to answer the jury's question regarding the age of consent, because there were no statements from the jury indicating that it would not be able to reach a verdict, and defendant conceded that the jury knew it was an option to issue a verdict of not guilty, and therefore the district court did not coerce the jury into rendering a verdict.State v. Cebada, 2024-NMCA-023, cert. denied.\n\nRequested instruction defining CSP of an inmate as an act committed without the inmate's consent properly denied.— Where defendant was charged with criminal sexual penetration (CSP) of an inmate, allegedly committed while defendant was employed as a corrections officer, and where, at trial, defendant proposed a jury instruction defining CSP of an inmate as an act committed without the inmate's consent, and where the district court determined that the phrase \"without consent\" was not necessary in the jury instruction defining unlawfulness for CSP of an inmate because, as a matter of law, an inmate cannot consent to sexual intercourse with a corrections officer, the district court did not err in denying defendant's proposed jury instruction defining unlawfulness for CSP of an inmate in terms of an absence of consent, because as a matter of law, an inmate confined in a correctional facility or jail cannot consent to sexual intercourse with a perpetrator in a position of authority over the inmate.State v. Arvizo, 2021-NMCA-055, cert. denied.\n\nDefense of consent.— Effective for cases filed after January 20, 2005, instructions have been approved for the defense of consent in criminal sexual penetration cases that are analogous to the defense of self-defense.State v. Jensen, 2005-NMCA-113, 138 N.M. 254, 118 P.3d 762, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-011, 138 N.M. 587, 124 P.3d 565.\n\nRequested instruction on lesser offense properly refused when no supporting evidence.— Where there is no view of the evidence adduced which would support the jury in finding the defendant guilty of third degree criminal sexual penetration which would not also require the jury to find him guilty of second degree criminal sexual penetration, a requested instruction on the lesser offense is properly refused.State v. Romero, 1980-NMCA-011, 94 N.M. 22, 606 P.2d 1116,overruled on other grounds byState v. Johnson, 1997-NMSC-036, 123 N.M. 640, 944 P.2d 869.\n\nCharge on probability unnecessary.— It was not erroneous in rape case to refuse instructions calling for jury's consideration of reasonable probability of testimony of prosecuting witness where jury was instructed that they must find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the offense charged before they could return verdict of guilty.State v. Richardson, 1944-NMSC-059, 48 N.M. 544, 154 P.2d 224.\n\nIntoxication instruction.— Evidence in prosecution for criminal sexual penetration was sufficient under New Mexico law to warrant an intoxication instruction.Florez v. Williams, 281 F.3d 1136 (10th Cir. 2002).\n\nCircumstantial evidence.— There was no error in court's refusal to give the usual stock instruction relating to circumstantial evidence where the state did not rely upon circumstantial evidence to prove its case in prosecution for sodomy involving two juveniles.State v. Frederick, 1964-NMSC-045, 74 N.M. 42, 390 P.2d 281.\n\nImpotency.— Where certain statements and testimony of defendant were only evidence of impotency, and no request for instruction on defense of impotency was tendered, it was not fundamental error on trial court's part to fail to instruct on its own motion on the defense, in view of confession and statements made by defendant admitting the act giving rise to the statutory rape prosecution.State v. Johnson, 1958-NMSC-046, 64 N.M. 83, 324 P.2d 781.\n\nCoercion not element in fourth degree criminal sexual penetration.— Subsection D (now G) does not include an element of force or coercion, and there is no basis for construing it to require nonconsent by the child as an element of the crime. 1988 Op.

      "text": "A. Criminal sexual contact is the unlawful and intentional touching of or application of force, without consent, to the unclothed intimate parts of another who has reached his eighteenth birthday, or intentionally causing another who has reached his eighteenth birthday to touch one's intimate parts.\n\nB. Criminal sexual contact does not include touching by a psychotherapist on his patient that is:\n\n(1) inadvertent;\n\n(2) casual social contact not intended to be sexual in nature; or\n\n(3) generally recognized by mental health professionals as being a legitimate element of psychotherapy.\n\nC. Criminal sexual contact in the fourth degree consists of all criminal sexual contact perpetrated:\n\n(1) by the use of force or coercion that results in personal injury to the victim;\n\n(2) by the use of force or coercion when the perpetrator is aided or abetted by one or more persons; or\n\n(3) when the perpetrator is armed with a deadly weapon.\n\nWhoever commits criminal sexual contact in the fourth degree is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nD. Criminal sexual contact is a misdemeanor when perpetrated with the use of force or coercion.\n\nE. For the purposes of this section, \"intimate parts\" means the primary genital area, groin, buttocks, anus or breast.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-9-22, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 109, § 3; 1981, ch. 8, § 1; 1991, ch. 26, § 2; 1993, ch. 177, § 3.\n\nCross references.— For provision that testimony of victim hereunder need not be corroborated,see30-9-15 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor limitations on testimony regarding victim's past sexual conduct,see30-9-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act,see29-11A-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, deleted the former second sentence of Subsection A, which defined \"intimate parts\"; added present Subsections B and E, redesignating the succeeding subsections accordingly; and made stylistic changes in Subsections A, C, and E.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, designated the formerly undesignated first paragraph as present Subsection A and redesignated former Subsections A and B as present Subsections B and C and, in present Subsection A, substituted \"unlawful and intentional\" for \"intentionally\" and deleted \"and someone other than one's spouse\" following \"birthday\" in two places in the first sentence and made a minor stylistic change in the second sentence.\n\nLegislative intent.— The legislative intent in defining \"intimate parts\" with a listing of five separate protected areas was to protect the victim from intrusions to each enumerated part; separate punishments are sustainable where evidence shows distinctly separate touchings of different parts.State v. Williams, 1986-NMCA-122, 105 N.M. 214, 730 P.2d 1196, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 111, 729 P.2d 1365.\n\nStatutory enumeration of different aggravating factors, or alternative methods of committing fourth degree criminal sexual contact, does not evince a legislative intent to authorize multiple punishments for the same act; where alternative methods of committing criminal sexual contact are submitted to the jury, the accused may be found guilty of only one offense.State v. Williams, 1986-NMCA-122, 105 N.M. 214, 730 P.2d 1196, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 111, 729 P.2d 1365.\n\nSection compared with 30-9-11 NMSA 1978.— This section is a general statute prohibiting a touching of intimate parts, whereas 30-9-11 NMSA 1978 is a specific statute which prohibits a touching of the penis with the lips or tongue. Section 30-9-11 NMSA rather than this section was the applicable statute in a prosecution for fellatio because the specific statute prevails over the general statute.State v. Gabaldon, 1978-NMCA-077, 92 N.M. 93, 582 P.2d 1306.\n\nInstruction on lesser included offense not warranted by the facts.— Where defendant was charged with aggravated sexual abuse; defendant broke into the victim's house; defendant, who was not wearing pants and who had a knife in defendant's hand, climbed on top of the victim, and ordered the victim to remove the victim's underwear; the victim felt defendant's erection; and the victim was told to tell the victim's friend who had entered the room that the victim was alright; during that time, defendant was continually using the knife to cut the victim's throat, defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser included offense of sexual contact by use of a deadly weapon resulting in personal injury.United States v. Dennison, 937 F.2d 559 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\nEvidence of \"force\".— The evidence was sufficient to establish the element of force necessary to sustain convictions for felony criminal sexual contact where the victim testified that the defendant, in the first incident, grabbed and squeezed her breasts causing her pain and discomfort and, in the second incident, squeezed her breasts so tightly that she was unable to breathe, became dizzy, and was unable to extricate herself from his grip.State v. Huff, 1998-NMCA-075, 125 N.M. 254, 960 P.2d 342, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 146, 958 P.2d 104.\n\n\"Groin\" defined.— Not having defined \"groin\" in this section as it read prior to 1993 amendment, and nothing to the contrary appearing, the legislature is presumed to use the common meaning of \"groin,\" which is the fold or depression marking the line between the lower part of the abdomen and the thigh; also, the region of this line.State v. Doe, 1979-NMCA-021, 93 N.M. 206, 598 P.2d 1166.\n\nEvidence sufficient to sustain conviction.— A touching of the upper, inner thigh is a touching in the region of the line between the lower part of the abdomen and the thigh; the touching is a touching of the groin and, therefore, sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction of criminal sexual contact.State v. Doe, 1979-NMCA-021, 93 N.M. 206, 598 P.2d 1166.\n\nLaw reviews.— For symposium, \"The Impact of the Equal Rights Amendment on the New Mexico Criminal Code,\" see 3 N.M.L. Rev. 106 (1973).\n\nAm.

      "text": "A. Criminal sexual contact of a minor is the unlawful and intentional touching of or applying force to the intimate parts of a minor or the unlawful and intentional causing of a minor to touch one's intimate parts. For the purposes of this section, \"intimate parts\" means the primary genital area, groin, buttocks, anus or breast.\n\nB. Criminal sexual contact of a minor in the second degree consists of all criminal sexual contact of the unclothed intimate parts of a minor perpetrated:\n\n(1) on a child under thirteen years of age; or\n\n(2) on a child thirteen to eighteen years of age when:\n\n(a) the perpetrator is in a position of authority over the child and uses that authority to coerce the child to submit;\n\n(b) the perpetrator uses force or coercion that results in personal injury to the child;\n\n(c) the perpetrator uses force or coercion and is aided or abetted by one or more persons; or\n\n(d) the perpetrator is armed with a deadly weapon.\n\nWhoever commits criminal sexual contact of a minor in the second degree is guilty of a second degree felony for a sexual offense against a child and, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978, shall be sentenced to a minimum term of imprisonment of three years, which shall not be suspended or deferred. The imposition of a minimum, mandatory term of imprisonment pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall not be interpreted to preclude the imposition of sentencing enhancements pursuant to the provisions of Sections 31-18-17, 31-18-25 and 31-18-26 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. Criminal sexual contact of a minor in the third degree consists of all criminal sexual contact of a minor perpetrated:\n\n(1) on a child under thirteen years of age; or\n\n(2) on a child thirteen to eighteen years of age when:\n\n(a) the perpetrator is in a position of authority over the child and uses this authority to coerce the child to submit;\n\n(b) the perpetrator uses force or coercion which results in personal injury to the child;\n\n(c) the perpetrator uses force or coercion and is aided or abetted by one or more persons; or\n\n(d) the perpetrator is armed with a deadly weapon.\n\nWhoever commits criminal sexual contact of a minor in the third degree is guilty of a third degree felony for a sexual offense against a child.\n\nD. Criminal sexual contact of a minor in the fourth degree consists of all criminal sexual contact:\n\n(1) not defined in Subsection C of this section, of a child thirteen to eighteen years of age perpetrated with force or coercion; or\n\n(2) of a minor perpetrated on a child thirteen to eighteen years of age when the perpetrator, who is a licensed school employee, an unlicensed school employee, a school contract employee, a school health service provider or a school volunteer, and who is at least eighteen years of age and is at least four years older than the child and not the spouse of that child, learns while performing services in or for a school that the child is a student in a school.\n\nWhoever commits criminal sexual contact in the fourth degree is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-9-23, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 109, § 4; 1987, ch. 203, § 2; 1991, ch. 26, § 3; 2001, ch. 161, § 3; 2003 (1st S.S.), ch. 1, § 4.\n\nCross references.— For sexual exploitation of children,see30-6A-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor provision that testimony of victim hereunder need not be corroborated,see30-9-15 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor limitations on testimony regarding victim's past sexual conduct,see30-9-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act,seeChapter 29, Article 11A NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2003 (1st S.S.) amendment,effective February 3, 2004, designated the formerly undesignated introductory language as Subsection A, inserted present Subsection B, redesignated former Subsections A and B as present Subsections C and D, added \"for a sexual offense against a child\" at the end of Subsection C, and substituted \"C\" for \"A\" in Paragraph (1) of Subsection D.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, inserted \"of a minor\" in the last paragraph in Subsection A; and in Subsection B inserted the Paragraph (1) designation and added Paragraph (2).\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, rewrote the first sentence which read \"Criminal sexual contact of a minor is unlawfully and intentionally touching or applying force to the intimate parts of a minor other than one's spouse, or unlawfully and intentionally causing a minor other than one's spouse, to touch one's intimate parts\"; in Paragraph (2) of Subsection A, substituted \"the perpetrator uses\" for \"by the use of\" at the beginning of subparagraphs (b) and (c) and made related stylistic changes; and made a stylistic change in the second sentence of the section.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, inserted \"not defined in Subsection A of this section\" in the first paragraph of Subsection B.\n\nThree requirements to determine the sufficiency of the evidence to support multiple convictions in child sex abuse cases.— To determine the sufficiency of the evidence to support multiple convictions in child sex abuse cases, the child victim must describe the proscribed act or acts committed with sufficient specificity to establish that unlawful conduct did in fact occur and to permit a jury to differentiate between the various types of sex acts to which the child victim was subjected, the child must describe the number of proscribed acts committed with sufficient certainty to support each of the counts alleged in the information or indictment, and the child must describe the general time period in which the proscribed acts occurred.State v. Atencio, 2024-NMSC-022,aff'g in partandrev'g in part2021-NMCA-061, 499 P.3d 635.\n\nSufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction for multiple counts of criminal sexual penetration of a minor.— The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions for twenty-one counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor where the ten-year-old child testified that he went to defendant's trailer every day for four or five months and that defendant touched the child's penis under his clothes every day that he went to defendant's trailer, where the child's sister testified that she saw defendant's hands in the child's pants, and where defendant admitted that he had touched the child's penis between twenty and thirty times and that he put the child's penis in his mouth once.State v. Atencio, 2024-NMSC-022,aff'g in partandrev'g in part2021-NMCA-061, 499 P.3d 635.\n\nSecond degree criminal sexual contact of a minor.— Second degree criminal sexual contact of a minor as defined in Subsection B of Section 30-9-13 NMSA 1978 is limited to instances in which a defendant touches or applies force to the unclothed intimate parts of a minor.State v. Trujillo, 2012-NMCA-092, 287 P.3d 344, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-008.\n\nSufficient evidence of third degree criminal sexual contact of a minor.— Where defendant caused the ten-year-old victim to touch defendant's unclothed penis while in bed; the trial court instructed the jury using the language of the uniform jury instruction in effect at the time for third degree criminal sexual contact of a minor; and defendant was found guilty of and was sentenced for second degree criminal sexual contact of a minor, defendant's conduct was a third degree felony under Subsection C, not a third degree felony under Subsection B.State v. Trujillo, 2012-NMCA-092, 287 P.3d 344, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-008.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where defendant, who was the spiritual leader of a religious group that lived together, was convicted of criminal sexual contact of a minor based on an unclothed experience with a teenage child who was a member of defendant's religious community; defendant claimed that the experience was a purely spiritual healing experience; the teenage child visited defendant alone and lay in bed naked with defendant; and the child testified that defendant kissed the child on the breast, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of criminal sexual contact of a minor.State v. Bent, 2013-NMCA-108, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nWhere defendant was charged with two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor that occurred between January 1, 2009 and February 12, 2009; most of the evidence related to an incident that occurred on February 11, 2009; the victim testified that defendant had touched the victim inappropriately prior to February 11, 2009; defendant testified on cross-examination that inappropriate things had been going on between defendant and the victim about for about a week; and a police officer testified that defendant admitted touching the victim inappropriately twice within the last week, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that defendant inappropriately touched the victim on February 11, 2009 and on another occasion between January 1, 2009 and February 12, 2009.State v. Garcia, 2013-NMCA-064, 302 P.3d 111, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-004.\n\nWhere the evidence showed that the defendant and the victim went to the trash dump two to three times per month during the period from October 2001 through May 2005; that the defendant sexually molested the victim on each trip when the defendant and the victim were alone; and that although the defendant's step-daughter accompanied the defendant and the victim to the trash dump on some occasions, there was no evidence that the step-daughter accompanied the defendant and the victim to the trash dump during the period from October 2001 through March 2002, the evidence was sufficient to support the state's charges of one count of criminal sexual contact of a minor for each month between October 2001 and March 2002.State v. Gipson, 2009-NMCA-053, 146 N.M. 202, 207 P.3d 1179.\n\nWhere the victim testified that defendant touched the victim's vulva and patted the victim's buttocks; the touching left the victim upset and sad; when confronted with accusations of improper sexual contact by one parent, defendant apologized, and when confronted by the victim's other parent defendant said that defendant had been forgiven, sufficient evidence supported defendant's convictions for criminal sexual contact with a minor.State v. Kerby, 2005-NMCA-016, 138 N.M. 232, 118 P.3d 740,aff'd, 2007-NMSC-014, 141 N.M. 413, 156 P.3d 704.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of numerous counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor perpetrated on his eight-year-old daughter and four-year-old stepdaughter; the four-year-old victims' testimony that defendant twice forced her to place her hand on defendant's penis, which was corroborated by the eight-year-old child victim, the evidence was sufficient to support convictions for criminal sexual contact of a minor.State v. Tapia, 2015-NMCA-048, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-004 and cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-004.\n\nSufficient evidence of attempt to commit second-degree criminal sexual contact of a minor.— Where defendant was charged with attempt to commit second-degree criminal sexual contact of a minor, and where the child victim testified at trial that defendant entered the room where she was sleeping, lifted the blanket off her, pulled down her pajama pants and underwear, pulled down his own pants, and rubbed her arm while masturbating, then walked to the other side of the bed, laid down next to her, and continued masturbating while rubbing her upper ribs over her clothing, and further testified that she was afraid that defendant was going to touch her private parts, there was substantial evidence to support defendant's conviction for attempted criminal sexual contact of a minor.State v. Notah, 2022-NMCA-005, cert. denied.\n\nThe district court did not err in denying defendant's proposed jury instruction for attempt to commit third-degree CSCM as a lesser included offense.— Where defendant was charged with attempt to commit second-degree criminal sexual contact of a minor (CSCM), and where the child victim testified at trial that defendant entered the room where she was sleeping, lifted the blanket off her, pulled down her pajama pants and underwear, pulled down his own pants, and rubbed her arm while masturbating, then walked to the other side of the bed, laid down next to her, and continued masturbating while rubbing her upper ribs over her clothing, and further testified that she was afraid that defendant was going to touch her private parts, and where defendant requested a jury instruction for a lesser included offense of attempt to commit third-degree CSCM, claiming that the evidence tended to better prove an intent to touch the child's breast area, which remained clothed, thus supporting a third-degree rather than a second-degree charge, the district court did not err in denying defendant's proposed jury instruction, because the elements of the crime differ in such a way that each may be committed without necessarily committing the other. Third-degree CSCM is not a lesser included offense of second-degree CSCM, because the element distinguishing between the two degrees of CSCM under thirteen years of age is whether the child victim's intimate part was clothed or unclothed, and in this case there was no reasonable view of the evidence that would support a jury finding that defendant partially undressed the child in an attempt to touch a clothed intimate part of her body but not an unclothed intimate part.State v. Notah, 2022-NMCA-005, cert. denied.\n\nPosition of authority.— Where the defendant and the victim were neighbors; the victim's mother worked with the defendant and the families were good friends; the families did things together; the defendant fixed things at the victim's house and took the trash to the trash dump as requested by the victim's mother; the victim thought of the defendant as a father figure; the victim spent the night at the defendant's house on a regular basis; the victim's mother entrusted the defendant with the victim's care; the defendant allowed the victim to earn money at the defendant's place of business, the jury could reasonably conclude that the defendant was in a position of authority over the victim.State v. Gipson, 2009-NMCA-053, 146 N.M. 202, 207 P.3d 1179.\n\nWhere the minor victims believed that the defendant, who was a massage therapist, was a professional healthcare provider; the victims had never had a massage; the defendant told the victims that a breast and buttock massage was part of a normal body massage, the defendant was in a position of authority over the victims. State v. Haskins, 2008-NMCA-086, 144 N.M. 287, 186 P.3d 916, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-005, 144 N.M. 331, 187 P.3d 677.\n\n\"Position of authority\" interpreted.— In 30-9-10(E) NMSA 1978, the legislature has designated certain relationships with a child that represent a \"position of authority,\" and the language \"who, by reason of that position, is able to exercise undue influence over a child\" does not pertain to each of the types of position of authority listed in the definition. Under the definition of \"position of authority\", a household member is presumed to be able to exercise undue influence over a child such that additional proof concerning a perpetrator's use or possession of such authority is not required.State v. Erwin, 2016-NMCA-032, cert. denied.\n\nWhere defendant, who was charged with criminal sexual contact of a child thirteen to eighteen years of age, did not dispute the evidence that he was a household member, but claimed that the state failed to prove that he used this position of authority to coerce the child to submit to sexual contact, the state was not required to prove that defendant, by reason of his position as a household member, was able to exercise undue influence over the child, because the legislature has designated certain relationships with a child, including a household member, that represent a position of authority for purposes of prosecution under 30-9-13 NMSA 1978.State v. Erwin, 2016-NMCA-032, cert. denied.\n\nTrustworthiness doctrine.—- The mere fact that defendant made multiple confessions or that he was suffering from Huntington's Disease when he made the confessions that he had inappropriately touched his daughter, who was two year old, and had made her touch him was not sufficient to establish the trustworthiness of his statements which the state relied upon to establish the corpus delicti of criminal sexual contact of a minor.State v. Weisser, 2007-NMCA-015, 141 N.M. 93, 150 P.3d 1043.\n\nThe mere fact that defendant's daughter, who was two years old, exhibited two of sixteen behaviors that could be corroborative of sexual abuse was not sufficient to establish the trustworthiness of the defendant's statements that he had inappropriately touched his daughter and had made her touch him which the state relied upon to establish the corpus delicti of criminal sexual contact of a minor.State v. Weisser, 2007-NMCA-015, 141 N.M. 93, 150 P.3d 1043.\n\nDenial of severance motion.— Where the trial court denied defendant's motion to sever the counts in the indictment relating to each of two female victims, with the result that the jury heard and was allowed to consider the evidence pertaining to both victims, and the evidence relating to each victim would not have been cross-admissible in separate trials to show defendant's plan to commit the offenses of criminal sexual contact of a minor in the third degree by a person in a position of authority and aggravated indecent exposure, the trial court abused its discretion when it denied defendant's severance motion for two trials.State v. Gallegos, 2005-NMCA-142, 138 N.M. 673, 125 P.3d 652, cert. granted, 2005-NMCERT-012, 138 N.M. 772, 126 P.3d 1137,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2007-NMSC-007, 141 N.M. 185, 152 P.3d 828.\n\nDeportation as consequence of guilty plea.— The district court was not constitutionally required to advise defendant that his guilty plea to criminal sexual contact of a minor almost certainly would result in his deportation.State v. Paredez, 2004-NMSC-036, 136 N.M. 533, 101 P.3d 799.\n\nGuilty plea entered knowingly and voluntarily.— In prosecution for criminal sexual contact of a minor in the third degree, where defendant understood the charges, understood the penalties, understood his constitutional rights and that he was waiving them, understood the factual basis on which the charges were brought, agreed with the facts, and fully intended to enter a plea of guilty, and at no time did defendant say anything that would indicate that he was reluctant to plead guilty, that he had been unduly rushed into agreeing to enter a plea, or that he was entering the plea based on fear or concern that, even though he was innocent, his attorney was not prepared for trial and he would likely be convicted although innocent, plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily.State v. Moore, 2004-NMCA-035, 135 N.M. 210, 86 P.3d 635.\n\nNot vague or overbroad.— The statutory crime of criminal sexual contact of a minor is not unconstitutionally vague.State v. Benny E., 1990-NMCA-052, 110 N.M. 237, 794 P.2d 380.\n\nThis section is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, nor does the statute encourage arbitrary or discriminatory prosecution.State v. Pierce, 1990-NMSC-049, 110 N.M. 76, 792 P.2d 408;State v. Scott, 1991-NMCA-081, 113 N.M. 525, 828 P.2d 958, cert. quashed,sub nom.Gibson v. State, 113 N.M. 524, 828 P.2d 957 (1992).\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Where defendant massaged the child's nude body, touching the child's breasts, buttocks, and vagina, was one continuous course of conduct, and there was no lapse in time between the times defendant touched the child's different body parts and no intervening events, there was one continuous course of conduct that was not capable of being split into three charges merely because defendant touched three different body parts and defendant's conviction for three counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.State v. Ervin, 2008-NMCA-016, 143 N.M. 493, 177 P.3d 1067, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-001, 143 N.M. 398, 176 P.3d 1130.\n\nWhere defendant attempted to move child's hand toward his groin area twice within a few minutes, one of his two convictions for attempted third degree criminal sexual contact of a minor violated double jeopardy.State v. Segura, 2002-NMCA-044, 132 N.M. 114, 45 P.3d 54, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 193, 46 P.3d 100.\n\nSpecific intent not element.— The legislature did not intend to adopt a requirement of specific sexual intent as an element of this section.State v. Pierce, 1990-NMSC-049, 110 N.M. 76, 792 P.2d 408.\n\nUnlawfulness as element.— By defining criminal sexual contact of a minor as \"unlawfully and intentionally\" touching a child's intimate parts, the legislature properly intended that the state must establish the unlawfulness of the touching as a distinct element of the offense.State v. Osborne, 1991-NMSC-032, 111 N.M. 654, 808 P.2d 624.\n\nLack of consent is not an element of criminal sexual contact of a minor.— Where defendant was convicted of one count of criminal sexual contact of a minor for forcibly touching the breast of a sixteen-year-old female victim, and where the evidence at trial established that defendant, a thirty-three year old man, who appeared intoxicated, entered a candy shop where the victim was working alone, that defendant lingered and made lewd comments of a sexual nature to the victim, that defendant repeatedly asked the victim to give him a hug, that when the victim instead extended her hand across the counter in an attempt to shake the defendant's hand, defendant took her hand and forcibly pulled her into a hug, and that as defendant released the victim from the hug, he brushed his hand over her chest and squeezed her breast, and where defendant claimed that fundamental error occurred because of the failure to instruct the jury on lack of consent, claiming that surveillance video footage of his encounter with the victim was evidence of the victim's consent to his actions, fundamental error did not occur, because lack of consent is not an element of criminal sexual contact of a minor. Consent of a child between the ages of thirteen and sixteen to engage in sexual contact is irrelevant where force occurred.State v. Begaye, 2022-NMCA-012, cert. denied.\n\nContributing to delinquency of a minor is separate offense.— The legislature intended for the crimes of criminal sexual contact of a minor and contributing to the delinquency of a minor to be separate crimes, punishable separately even when unitary conduct violates both statutes. Therefore, convictions under both statutes do not violate double jeopardy principles.State v. Trevino, 1993-NMSC-067, 116 N.M. 528, 865 P.2d 1172.\n\nMerger of attempted criminal sexual penetration and criminal sexual contact of minor from unitary conduct.— Despite the state's contention that the conduct underlying the offenses charged against the defendant was not unitary, in that the defendant's action of lying on the victim constituted criminal sexual contact of a minor and his action of preparing to \"hump\" her constituted attempted criminal sexual penetration of a minor, the actions can only reasonably be deemed to constitute unitary conduct; the contact and attempted penetration all took place within the same short space of time, with no physical separation between the illegal acts.State v. Mora, 2003-NMCA-072, 133 N.M. 746, 69 P.3d 256, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 727, 69 P.3d 237.\n\nCriminal sexual contact of minor is not lesser included offense of attempted criminal sexual penetration.— For purposes of double jeopardy, the offenses of criminal sexual contact of a minor and attempted criminal sexual penetration of a minor cannot be characterized as lesser included and greater inclusive crimes because they each contain different elements and stand independently in relation to one another.State v. Mora, 2003-NMCA-072, 133 N.M. 746, 69 P.3d 256, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 727, 69 P.3d 237.\n\nSufficiency of notice of crime charged.— Where a child was charged with unlawfully and intentionally touching or applying force to the intimate parts of his sister, and the charging document contained not only a time frame, but the name of the alleged victim, the child was given adequate notice to enable him to prepare a defense and to assure that any conviction or acquittal would be res judicata against a subsequent prosecution for the same offense.State v. Benny E., 1990-NMCA-052, 110 N.M. 237, 794 P.2d 380.\n\nStatements part of res gestae.— In prosecution for sexual assault upon four year old female child, statements made by victim within 45 minutes after awaking, crying and scared, upon being discovered in bed with defendant, could be seen as contemporaneous with shocked condition and as spontaneous utterances, and were properly admitted under the res gestae exception to the hearsay rule.State v. Apodaca, 1969-NMCA-038, 80 N.M. 244, 453 P.2d 764.\n\nSimilar prior acts.— Admission into evidence of prior sexual acts between defendant and prosecuting witness similar to those charged in conviction for indecent handling and touching of girl under age of 16 was not an abuse of trial court's discretion as a matter of law.State v. Minns, 1969-NMCA-035, 80 N.M. 269, 454 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 80 N.M. 234, 453 P.2d 597.\n\nIn a prosecution for criminal sexual contact with a minor, the admission of evidence of prior \"bad\" acts, including uncharged sexual battery dating back to the victim's early childhood, was not error. The evidence corroborated the victim's testimony and placed the charged acts in context. The evidence of defendant's treatment of the victim was relevant to the issue of credibility and not merely offered to show defendant's character and propensity to commit the crime.State v. Landers, 1992-NMCA-131, 115 N.M. 514, 853 P.2d 1270,overruled on other grounds byState v. Kerby, 2005-NMCA-106, 138 N.M. 232, 118 P.3d 740.\n\nPhysical evidence is not requiredto support a conviction under this section.State v. Landers, 1992-NMCA-131, 115 N.M. 514, 853 P.2d 1270, cert. quashed, 115 N.M. 535, 854 P.2d 362,overruled on other grounds byState v. Kerby, 2005-NMCA-106, 138 N.M. 232, 118 P.3d 740.\n\nCircumstantial evidence was sufficientto allow a jury to find accused guilty under this section beyond a reasonable doubt.Mora v. Williams, 111 Fed. Appx. 537 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\nChild's testimony sufficient.— The uncorroborated testimony of a minor child competent to testify, unless there be something inherently improbable in it, is deemed substantial evidence and sufficient to uphold a conviction.State v. Trujillo, 1955-NMSC-094, 60 N.M. 277, 291 P.2d 315.\n\nCorroboration was not essential to convictionin a prosecution for indecent handling and touching of a minor under 18 years of age.State v. Trujillo, 1955-NMSC-094, 60 N.M. 277, 291 P.2d 315.\n\nUse of a position of authority to coerce sexual contactmay be proven inferentially and although the position of employer in and of itself does not necessarily establish the use of that position as coercion, where there exists sufficient connection between the employment and the sexual contact, the jury can appropriately infer that the employer used coercion.State v. Trevino, 1991-NMCA-085, 113 N.M. 804, 833 P.2d 1170,aff'd sub nom.State v. Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, 113 N.M. 780, 833 P.2d 1146.\n\nCoercion by a person in a position of authority is not negated where victim resists the defendant's attempts to force sexual contact.— Where defendant was found guilty of two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor by a person in a position of authority, where the evidence at trial established that defendant grabbed his thirteen-year-old niece's clothed buttocks while she walked past him, and later placed his hand directly on the \"outer lip\" of her genital area while she was sleeping, and where defendant argued that the child was not coerced to submit to sexual contact because she immediately resisted his attempts to force sexual contact, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to infer defendant was in a position of authority over the child and used that authority to coerce the child to submit to sexual contact because of the nature of the relationship between defendant and the child and the child's testimony that she felt pressure not to interfere with the family dynamics given the close relationship between her family and her uncle's family. Though a child's resistance may have some relevance to the element of coercion, the primary focus of the analysis should be on the perpetrator's actions, not the victim's.State v. Arvizo, 2018-NMSC-026,rev'gNo. 33,697, mem. op. (N.M. Ct. App. June 28, 2016) (non-precedential).\n\nInstruction on position of authority.— The defendant's requested jury instruction that \"[t]he fact the defendant was in a position of authority does not alone establish that he used that authority to coerce sexual contact\" was not a correct statement of the law because coercion for the purposes of this section occurs when a defendant occupies a position which enables that person to exercise undue influence over the victim and that influence is the means of compelling submission to the contact.State v. Gardner, 2003-NMCA-107, 134 N.M. 294, 76 P.3d 47, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 179, 74 P.3d 1071.\n\nDefendant's motivation irrelevant.— A defendant who unlawfully and intentionally touches an intimate part of a minor's body is guilty of criminal sexual contact of a minor, regardless of whether the defendant was motivated by a desire to obtain sexual gratification or by some other desire.State v. Gardner, 2003-NMCA-107, 134 N.M. 294, 76 P.3d 47, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 179, 74 P.3d 1071.\n\nImplicit waiver of right to confrontation.— Where defendant at trial did not file a response to the state's motion for a videotaped deposition, nor did he object at the time of the taking of the deposition or at the time that the district court admitted the deposition tape as evidence, but, to the contrary, defendant relied on both the deposition tape and the interview tape in his opening and closing arguments, defendant's actions indicate that he implicitly waived his right to face-to-face confrontation by conduct.State v. Herrera, 2004-NMCA-015, 135 N.M. 79, 84 P.3d 696, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-001, 135 N.M. 160, 85 P.3d 802.\n\nOn appeal from a prosecution for criminal sexual contact of a minor, where defendant argued that the district court was constitutionally required to make specific findings justifying its substitution of videotaped testimony for face-to-face confrontation, even though defendant never objected to the substitution, defendant waived his Confrontation Clause claim by failing to raise the confrontation issue at trial and there is no fundamental error.State v. Herrera, 2004-NMCA-015, 135 N.M. 79, 84 P.3d 696, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-001, 135 N.M. 160, 85 P.3d 802.\n\nInstruction on time limitation properly refused.— Where time limitation was not an essential element of the offenses of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and criminal sexual contact of a minor, no error was committed by the court's failure to instruct the jury on time limitations in connection with the charges at issue.State v. Cawley, 1990-NMSC-088, 110 N.M. 705, 799 P.2d 574.\n\nInstruction on intoxication improperly refused.— Where trial court by instruction fixed specific intent as an essential ingredient of offense charged, sexual assault of female under the age of 16, refusal to instruct on defense of intoxication was reversible error.State v. Rayos, 1967-NMSC-008, 77 N.M. 204, 420 P.2d 314.\n\nNo instruction on touchings' lawfulness absent evidence.— Although the defendant contended that all touching of the victim was colorably lawful, there was no evidence from which the jury could infer that the particular touchings that the state sought to prove were lawful. The only way to view the defendant's evidence was that he did not touch the victim whatsoever in the manner the state alleged and that all of his other touchings were lawful. Because the defendant did not allege that the particular touchings forming the basis for the charges were lawful, the issue of the lawfulness of those touchings was not at issue, and the trial court's failure to give a lawfulness instuction was not fundamental error.State v. Landers, 1992-NMCA-131, 115 N.M. 514, 853 P.2d 1270, cert. quashed, 115 N.M. 535, 854 P.2d 362,overruled on other grounds byState v. Kerby, 2005-NMCA-106, 138 N.M. 232, 118 P.3d 740.\n\nAttempt.— Reversal of defendant's convictions under this section was required because the attempt aspect of the charge needed to be connected with the underlying crime in a manner that made it clear to the jury that the initiatory crime of attempt applied to all elements of the underlying crime.State v. Segura, 2002-NMCA-044, 132 N.M. 114, 45 P.3d 54, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 193, 46 P.3d 100.\n\nSufficient evidence of criminal sexual contact.— Where defendant was charged with criminal sexual contact of a minor and where the minor child, at trial, testified that defendant unzipped her pajamas and positioned his hand in the her underwear and touched the skin underneath her underwear in a rubbing motion, a jury could reasonably believe that defendant touched or applied force to the child's unclothed groin area, and thus there was sufficient evidence of criminal sexual contact of a minor.State v. Pitner, 2016-NMCA-102, cert. denied.\n\nEvidence sufficient to support conviction.— Father's conviction on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor was supported by substantial evidence, including the testimony of the child and a therapist who interviewed the child.State v. Newman, 1989-NMCA-086, 109 N.M. 263, 784 P.2d 1006, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 262, 784 P.2d 1005.\n\nEvidence consisting of the testimony of the victim's counselor and the victim herself was sufficient to support convictions of criminal sexual contact with a minor and criminal sexual penetration of a minor.State v. Ortiz-Burciaga, 1999-NMCA-146, 128 N.M. 382, 993 P.2d 96, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 149, 990 P.2d 823.\n\nEvidence was sufficient to demonstrate that defendant coerced a 16-year old boy to submit to sexual contact by using his position as employer, where defendant, who had hired the boy to help repair appliances, closed the doors and windows when the boy indicated a desire to leave after defendant made sexual advances.State v. Corbin, 1991-NMCA-021, 111 N.M. 707, 809 P.2d 57, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 720, 809 P.2d 634.\n\nJury could infer coercion resulted from the employment relationship. First, the sexual contact took place on a job site owned by defendant, who had sole supervisory control not only over the premises but also over the victim. Second, defendant assigned victim to a small ticket booth where all of the incidents of sexual contact took place.State v. Trevino, 1991-NMCA-085, 113 N.M. 804, 833 P.2d 1170,aff'd sub nom.State v. Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, 113 N.M. 780, 833 P.2d 1146.\n\nWhere four students testified that the defendant, an assistant principal, had on various occasions while at school touched their breasts and/or buttocks, the testimony was sufficient for a reasonable mind to conclude that the unlawful contact was at least in part a result of the defendant's position of authority.State v. Gardner, 2003-NMCA-107, 134 N.M. 294, 76 P.3d 47, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 179, 74 P.3d 1071.\n\nSufficient evidence of criminal sexual contact of a minor for purposes of retrial.— Where defendant was convicted of one count of criminal sexual penetration of a minor and twenty-one counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor, and where defendant's convictions were overturned based on the state's violation of defendant's constitutional right against self-incrimination, there was sufficient evidence to support each of defendant's convictions for purposes of retrial where, at trial, the state presented evidence from the child victim that defendant committed multiple instances of criminal sexual contact and at least one instance of criminal sexual penetration over a four-month period and defendant's admission that he had put the child's penis in his mouth at least once and had touched the child's penis between twenty and thirty times.State v. Atencio, 2021-NMCA-061,aff'd in partandrev'd in partby 2024-NMSC-022.\n\nDisjunctive in instruction not error.— It was not error for the district court to instruct the jury that in order to convict defendant of criminal sexual contact of a minor under the age of 13, it must conclude that defendant touched or applied force either to the vagina or breast of the victim, as the essential element of the crime is touching an intimate part of the child.State v. Nichols, 2006-NMCA-017, 139 N.M. 72, 128 P.3d 500.\n\nSpecial probation condition did not terminate parental rights.— Where defendant pleaded guilty to eight counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor in the fourth degree, the charges stemming from a series of incidents that occurred over the course of several months between defendant and one of his adopted daughters, and after the sentencing hearing, the district court imposed nine conditions of probation, with one condition prohibiting defendant from having direct or indirect contact with all children under the age of 18, including the victim of his crimes, absent a court order, the special condition did not amount to a \"de facto\" termination of parental rights, necessitating jurisdiction within the children's court.State v. Garcia, 2005-NMCA-065, 137 N.M. 597, 113 P.3d 867.\n\nLaw reviews.— For symposium, \"The Impact of the Equal Rights Amendment on the New Mexico Criminal Code,\" see 3 N.M.L. Rev. 106 (1973).\n\nAm.

In addition to any punishment provided pursuant to the provisions of this section, the court shall order a person convicted for committing indecent exposure to participate in and complete a program of professional counseling at his own expense.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-9-24, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 109, § 5; 1996, ch. 84, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For provision that testimony of victim hereunder need not be corroborated,see30-9-15 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor limitations on testimony regarding victim's past sexual conduct,see30-9-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1996 amendment,effective July 1, 1996, rewrote and designated the existing language as Subsections A through C, and added Subsection D.\n\nVehicle on public street as \"public view\".— The cab of a pickup truck parked on a public street in daylight hours is open to the public view and the actions of a defendant in calling an 11 year-old girl to a window on the pretext of asking directions consequently fall within the meaning of indecent exposure under this section.State v. Artrip, 1991-NMCA-035, 112 N.M. 87, 811 P.2d 585, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 21, 810 P.2d 1241.\n\nNo exposure to \"public view\".— The defendant, who deliberately displayed his genital area before a minor child in the household wherein he was living, did not indecently expose himself to \"public view\" as proscribed by this section.State v.

McKinzie, 1963-NMSC-060, 72 N.M. 23, 380 P.2d 177.\n\nContributing to delinquency of a minor is separate offense.— An element of indecent exposure is that the defendant's acts take place in \"public view;\" there is no such element in contributing to delinquency of a minor, and the trial court's refusal to give the instruction as a lesser included offense was proper.State v. Henderson, 1993-NMSC-068, 116 N.M. 537, 865 P.2d 1181,overruled in part on other grounds byState v. Meadors, 1995-NMSC-073, 121 N.M. 38, 908 P.2d 731.\n\nPrior offenses.— In prosecution for indecent exposure before female child under age of 18, question to defendant's wife regarding a prior second degree rape charge filed against her husband, posed after she testified that his sexual morality had never been called into question, related only to the character of defendant, which he himself had placed in issue by taking the stand, and claimed prejudice was unavailing to him.State v. McKinzie, 1963-NMSC-060, 72 N.M. 23, 380 P.2d 177.\n\nCross-examination prejudicial.— It was an abuse of discretion for trial court to permit the cross-examination of defendant in prosecution for indecent demonstration or exposure in presence of female under 16, to be conducted to the extent and in the manner disclosed by the record, where for purpose of attacking defendant's credibility the prosecutor asked about specified lewd acts with his young daughter, describing the acts, unnecessarily repeating his questions, framing his interrogations as assertions and challenging defendant's denials, with result that defendant was denied a fair trial.State v.

As a matter of substantive right, in prosecutions pursuant to the provisions of Sections 30-9-11 through 30-9-15 NMSA 1978, evidence of a patient's psychological history, emotional condition or diagnosis obtained by an accused psychotherapist during the course of psychotherapy shall not be admitted unless, and only to the extent that, the court finds that the evidence is material and relevant to the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not outweigh its probative value.\n\nC. If the evidence referred to in Subsection A or B of this section is proposed to be offered, the defendant shall file a written motion prior to trial. The court shall hear the pretrial motion prior to trial at an in camera hearing to determine whether the evidence is admissible pursuant to the provisions of Subsection A or B of this section. If new information, which the defendant proposes to offer pursuant to the provisions of Subsection A or B of this section, is discovered prior to or during the trial, the judge shall order an in camera hearing to determine whether the proposed evidence is admissible. If the proposed evidence is deemed admissible, the court shall issue a written order stating what evidence may be introduced by the defendant and stating the specific questions to be permitted.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-9-26, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 109, § 7; 1993, ch. 177, § 4.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, substituted \"30-9-11 through 30-9-15 NMSA 1978\" for \"2 through 6 of this act\" near the beginning of Subsection A; added present Subsection B, redesignating former Subsection B as present Subsection C; in Subsection C, inserted \"referred to in Subsection A or B of this section\" in the first sentence, inserted \"or B\" in the second and third sentences, and deleted \"under Subsection A of this section\" from the end of the third sentence; and made stylistic changes throughout Subsections A and C.\n\nVictim's past allegations against a third party.— Where the trial court excluded evidence of the victim's past allegations against a third party which related to the victim's reputation for past sexual conduct, the victim made the allegations against the third party in the past; the circumstances of the prior incident in no way resembled the allegations that led to the charges against the defendant; the defendant did not show that the circumstances of the prior allegations were clearly relevant to any material issue in the defendant's case other than propensity; and the defendant did not show how the prior allegations related to the defendant's defense, the trial court properly excluded the evidence.State v. Casillas, 2009-NMCA-034, 145 N.M. 783, 205 P.3d 830, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-003, 146 N.M. 603, 213 P.3d 507.\n\nAccused's right of confrontation denied.— Where the defendant's sole defense in his rape trial was that the child victim consented to sexual intercourse with him and then fabricated an allegation of rape because her parents, who were opposed to premarital sex because of their deeply religious convictions, had previously punished the victim for engaging in consensual sex with someone else, the defendant was denied his constitutional right of confrontation when the trial court prohibited the defendant from cross-examining the victim and her parents about the prior sexual encounter and the punishment the victim had received from her parents as a result of that encounter and the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Stephen F., 2008-NMSC-037, 144 N.M. 360, 188 P.3d 84,aff'g, 2007-NMCA-025, 141 N.M. 199, 152 P.3d 842.\n\nPrior sexual abuse of a child.— To rebut the natural assumption that a young victim of sexual abuse is sexually naive and could only have learned about it because the victim was victimized by the defendant, the defendant may introduce the fact that the victim had been previously sexually abused to show an alternative source of sexual knowledge.State v. Payton, 2007-NMCA-110, 142 N.M. 385, 165 P.3d 1161, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-008, 142 N.M. 434, 166 P.3d 1088.\n\nIn order to present evidence of victim's alleged prostitution,defendant had to establish that the evidence was material and that its prejudicial effect did not outweigh its probative value.State v. Maestas, 2005-NMCA-062, 137 N.M. 477, 112 P.3d 1134,rev'd on other grounds, 2007-NMSC-001, 140 N.M. 836, 149 P.3d 933.\n\nSection is not unconstitutional on its face.State v. Herrera, 1978-NMCA-048, 92 N.M. 7, 582 P.2d 384, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 751, 580 P.2d 972.\n\nThe fact that this section attempts to regulate practice and procedure in district courts in regard to a victim's past sexual conduct does not mean that the legislation is unconstitutional in that it violates the provisions for separation of governmental power.State v. Herrera, 1978-NMCA-048, 92 N.M. 7, 582 P.2d 384, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 751, 580 P.2d 972.\n\nThis section was intended to encourage reporting of rapesby minimizing intrusive inquiry into the personal affairs of the victim.State v. Romero, 1980-NMCA-011, 94 N.M. 22, 606 P.2d 1116,overruled on other grounds byState v. Johnson, 1997-NMSC-036, 123 N.M. 640, 944 P.2d 869.\n\nSection protects victim against unwarranted invasions of her privacy.— In addition to its effect in insulating the jury from prejudicial material, this section serves to protect the victim of the crime against unwarranted invasions of her privacy.State v. Romero, 1980-NMCA-011, 94 N.M. 22, 606 P.2d 1116,overruled on other grounds byState v. Johnson, 1997-NMSC-036, 123 N.M. 640, 944 P.2d 869.\n\nPurpose of statute.— The statute is designed to minimize intrusive inquiry into a rape complainant's private life.State v. Ramos, 1993-NMCA-072, 115 N.M. 718, 858 P.2d 94, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 602, 856 P.2d 250.\n\nSection not in conflict with rules.— The procedures in this section do not conflict, but rather are consistent, with Rule 36, N.M.R. Crim. P. (now Rule 5-603 NMRA), regarding pretrial hearings.State v. Herrera, 1978-NMCA-048, 92 N.M. 7, 582 P.2d 384, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 751, 580 P.2d 972.\n\nThe balancing approach to be applied in admitting evidence concerning past sexual conduct under this section does not conflict, but rather is consistent, with Rule 403, N.M.R. Evid. (now Rule 11-403 NMRA).State v. Herrera, 1978-NMCA-048, 92 N.M. 7, 582 P.2d 384, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 751, 580 P.2d 972.\n\nOnce a showing sufficient to raise an issue as to relevancy of past sexual conduct is made, the balancing test of this section and of Rule 403, N.M.R. Evid. (now Rule 11-403 NMRA) is to be applied in determining admissibility.State v. Herrera, 1978-NMCA-048, 92 N.M. 7, 582 P.2d 384, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 751, 580 P.2d 972.\n\nThere is no conflict between this section and Rule 405, N.M.R. Evid. (now Rule 11-405 NMRA), regarding methods of proving character, because the balancing approach of Rule 403, N.M.R. Evid. (now Rule 11-403 NMRA) is also applicable to evidence admissible under Rule 405, N.M.R. Evid.State v. Herrera, 1978-NMCA-048, 92 N.M. 7, 582 P.2d 384, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 751, 580 P.2d 972.\n\nSection is not limited to sex by consent;rather, its unlimited wording applies to all forms of past sexual conduct, so that a prior rape is past sexual conduct within the meaning of this section.State v. Montoya, 1978-NMCA-052, 91 N.M. 752, 580 P.2d 973, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 751, 580 P.2d 972.\n\nSection does not protect against waiver of privilege not to disclose medical records.— In a prosecution for criminal sexual penetration, this section did not apply to give the victim the right to release her medical and psychotherapy records to the police and state's attorneys and then invoke an absolute privilege againstin camerainspection by the court or subsequent disclosure to other parties.State v. Gonzales, 1996-NMCA-026, 121 N.M. 421, 912 P.2d 297.\n\nDiscretion of trial court.— In prosecution for indecent exposure before female child under 18, where questions asked of prosecutrix on cross-examination relating to specific acts of sexual misconduct were allowed by the court on theory that they were an attack upon her credibility, the permitting or limiting of extent of such questioning was well within discretion of the trial court.State v. McKinzie, 1963-NMSC-060, 72 N.M. 23, 380 P.2d 177.\n\nLimited psychiatric examination of victim permissible.— Insofar as a psychiatric examination probes the past sexual behavior of the victim, it is within the terms of this section.State v. Romero, 1980-NMCA-011, 94 N.M. 22, 606 P.2d 1116,overruled on other grounds byState v. Johnson, 1997-NMSC-036, 123 N.M. 640, 944 P.2d 869.\n\nPrior accusations of sexual misconduct.— In a prosecution for sexual misconduct, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's request to call the victim's stepfather and the defendant's wife to testify that the victim had previously falsely accused the stepfather of sexual misconduct.State v. Scott, 1991-NMCA-081, 113 N.M. 525, 828 P.2d 958, cert. quashed,sub nom.Gibson v. State, 113 N.M. 524, 828 P.2d 957 (1992).\n\nVictim's past sexual conduct not admissible.— Even though evidence of a victim's prior sexual conduct may be admissible to show bias, motive to fabricate or for other purposes consistent with the constitutional right of confrontation, the trial court did not err in rejecting such evidence where defendant failed to show that it was material and relevant, and that its probative value equaled or outweighed its inflammatory nature.State v. Johnson, 1997-NMSC-036, 123 N.M. 640, 944 P.2d 869.\n\nVictim's past sexual conductin itself indicates nothing concerning consent in particular case.State v. Herrera, 1978-NMCA-048, 92 N.M. 7, 582 P.2d 384, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 751, 580 P.2d 972;seeState v. Romero, 1980-NMCA-011, 94 N.M. 22, 606 P.2d 1116,overruled on other grounds by,State v. Johnson, 1997-NMSC-036, 123 N.M. 640, 944 P.2d 869.\n\nVictim's virginity relevant if consent at issue.— Evidence of a victim's virginity is relevant in cases involving alleged forcible criminal sexual penetration where the consent of the victim is at issue.State v. Singleton, 1984-NMCA-110, 102 N.M. 66, 691 P.2d 67.\n\nPrevious chastity immaterial.— Ordinarily the previous chastity of prosecuting witness is immaterial in a statutory rape case.State v. Armijo, 1958-NMSC-108, 64 N.M. 431, 329 P.2d 785.\n\nProbative value of evidence of victim's past sexual activitymust be weighed against its prejudicial effect, and its prejudicial effect is great.State v. Romero, 1980-NMCA-011, 94 N.M. 22, 606 P.2d 1116,overruled on other grounds byState v. Johnson, 1997-NMSC-036, 123 N.M. 640, 944 P.2d 869.\n\nConfrontation of witness.— The discretion of the trial court to exclude evidence of sexual conduct must be weighed against a criminal defendant's constitutional right to confront witnesses.Manlove v. Sullivan, 1989-NMSC-029, 108 N.M. 471, 775 P.2d 237.\n\nVictim's past sexual history.— Evidence of a minor's past sexual history was properly excluded since that evidence was not relevant to the charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.State v. Lucero, 1994-NMCA-129, 118 N.M. 696, 884 P.2d 1175, cert. denied, 118 N.M. 731, 885 P.2d 1325.\n\nPast conduct negativing defendant's paternity.— Exception to the rule that previous chastity of victim is immaterial might be where her pregnancy is shown and testimony given that defendant was father of the child, as there the testimony of prior sexual acts might be pertinent on rebuttal as tending to show that another might have been the cause of such condition.State v. Armijo, 1958-NMSC-108, 64 N.M. 431, 329 P.2d 785.\n\nIssue of penetration.— Trial court did not err in refusing to permit cross-examination of prosecuting witness in prosecution for statutory rape concerning prior acts of intercourse with other men, where sole reason advanced by defendant's counsel for admissibility was on the issue of penetration, an issue about which there was no genuine controversy.State v. Armijo, 1958-NMSC-108, 64 N.M. 431, 329 P.2d 785.\n\nDe novo reviewis the proper standard of review for analyzing cases implicating both the rape shield rule and the Confrontation Clause.State v. Montoya, 2014-NMSC-032,rev'g2013-NMCA-076, 306 P.3d 470.\n\nAnalysis of cases implicating both the rape shield rule and the Confrontation Clause.— When a defendant makes a claim that the rape shield law bars evidence implicating the defendant's confrontation rights, the district court must first identify a theory of relevance implicating the defendant's constitutional right to confrontation and then weigh whether evidence elicited under that theory would be more prejudicial than probative.State v. Montoya, 2014-NMSC-032,rev'g2013-NMCA-076, 306 P.3d 470.\n\nApplication of rape shield rule violated Confrontation Clause.— Where defendant and the victim, who had a sexual relationship for two years, began arguing about a telephone call that defendant had received; during the argument, defendant indicated to the victim that defendant wanted sex; defendant and the victim went into defendant's bedroom where defendant got on top of the victim and tried to remove the victim's clothes; the victim told the defendant \"no\" several times and pushed and kicked defendant until defendant stopped making sexual advances; defendant was indicted for kidnapping with intent to commit a sexual offense; the district court refused to allow defendant on cross-examination to ask the victim whether the victim and defendant had a long-standing sexual relationship and whether they had a history of engaging in sex after an argument as \"make-up sex\" to resolve disputes for the purpose of showing that defendant never intended to sexually assault the victim but was pursuing consensual \"make-up sex\" as defendant and the victim had done after arguments in the past; the victim was the sole material witness against defendant and the only witness who could provide testimony necessary for defendant's theory of the case; and the evidence was relevant to defendant's defense and would not have had a prejudicial impact on the victim, the district court's ruling violated defendant's confrontation right because it denied defendant an opportunity to present a full and fair defense.State v. Montoya, 2014-NMSC-032,rev'g2013-NMCA-076, 306 P.3d 470.\n\nStandard of review for cases involving the rape shield rule and the Confrontation Clause.— There are three steps and three standards of review that relate to the application of the rape shield rule. First, the court reviews de novo whether a defendant has presented a theory of admissibility that implicates the defendant's confrontation rights. If the defendant has, the court undertakes a de novo balancing of the state's interest in excluding the evidence against the defendant's constitutional rights to determine if the district court acted within the wide scope of its discretion to limit cross-examination. If the Confrontation Clause is not implicated or if there has been no Confrontation Clause violation, the court examines whether the district court has abused its discretion in its application of the rule itself.State v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-076,rev'dby 2014-NMSC-032.\n\nApplication of the rape shield rule did not implicate the Confrontation Clause.— Where defendant and the victim had been arguing; defendant wanted to have sex with the victim, but the victim refused; defendant got on top of the victim and attempted to remove the victim's clothing; the victim pushed and kicked defendant until defendant stopped; defendant did not force the victim to have sex; defendant was charged with kidnapping and attempt to commit criminal sexual penetration; to show that defendant did not have specific intent to commit the crimes, defendant sought to introduce evidence of the sexual history of the victim and defendant to show that the defendant's intent and the victim's belief was that defendant was trying to have sex to \"make-up\" just as they had done in the past; the district court precluded defendant from inquiring into the party's sexual history; at trial, the victim testified that defendant and the victim had been friends for two years, the victim believed that defendant would not penetrate the victim unless the victim consented, and the victim perceived defendant's actions as an attempt to obtain the victim's consent to have sex; defendant claimed that defendant's confrontation rights had been violated because defendant was unable to challenge an opposing version of the facts, the district court's exclusion of the evidence did not implicate or violate the Confrontation Clause, because defendant sought not to confront the victim, but to use the victim's testimony as evidence unrelated to the truth or accuracy of the victim's testimony and the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding of evidence of the history of victim's and defendant's sexual relationship.State v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-076,rev'dby 2014-NMSC-032.\n\nPrior acts with defendant.— Admission into evidence of prior sexual acts between defendant and prosecuting witness similar to those charged in prosecution for indecent handling and touching of girl under age of 16 was not an abuse of trial court's discretion as matter of law.State v. Minns, 1969-NMCA-035, 80 N.M. 269, 454 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 80 N.M. 234, 453 P.2d 597.\n\nTrial court did not err in allowing a child-victim to testify about his sexual conduct with defendant while in California and before moving to New Mexico, where the California episodes were relevant to the episodes in New Mexico.State v. Gillette, 1985-NMCA-037, 102 N.M. 695, 699 P.2d 626.\n\nImpeachment evidence did not violate rape shield statute.— Where defendant was charged with kidnapping in the first degree, and where, at trial, defendant sought to elicit testimony from the complaining witness about her delay in reporting a sexual assault that allegedly occurred during the kidnapping, and also attempted to impeach her credibility by asking about her failure to disclose to law enforcement and medical personnel her ongoing, consensual sexual relationship with defendant, and where the state objected on relevancy grounds, the district court abused its discretion in limiting cross-examination of the complaining witness under the rape shield statute, because defense counsel's questions were not about the witness's sexual conduct or reputation for past sexual conduct, the cross-examination was designed to impeach the witness's credibility for truthfulness, not to establish her propensity to have consensual sex with him or for some other purpose generally prohibited by the rape shield statute. Moreover, the error was not harmless, because given the importance of the complaining witness's credibility to the state's case, defendant was prejudiced by the district court's ruling.State v. Salazar, 2023-NMCA-026.\n\nEvidence of past sexual encounter of victim and third party.— Trial court acted within its discretion in suppressing evidence of a past sexual encounter of the victim and a third party during which the victim allegedly affixed the ropes found on the bed to restrain the third party in the course of consensual sexual activity, where such evidence was irrelevant to defendant's culpability for the crimes charged, advanced no legitimate defense, excuse, or justification for the crimes charged, and were likely to inject false issues and confuse the jury.State v. Swafford, 1989-NMCA-069, 109 N.M. 132, 782 P.2d 385, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 54, 781 P.2d 782.\n\nTestimony offered for fabrication defense.— Testimony that the prosecutrix made up stories of rape and abduction in the past that resembled the facts alleged in the case, that prosecutrix had once recanted such a story, and that prosecutrix was the sort of person who would willingly see an innocent person put in jail, was not evidence of sexual conduct precluded by the Rape Shield Law but rather went to the prosecutrix's proclivity for truthfulness and was relevant both to impeach the prosecutrix's credibility and as direct evidence in the petitioner's fabrication defense. The testimony was closely enough related to sexual conduct to be barred by this section, but the court's discretion to exclude such evidence must be weighed against a defendant's constitutional right to confront witnesses.Manlove v. Tansy, 981 F.2d 473 (10th Cir. 1992).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Survey of New Mexico Law, 1979-80: Evidence,\" see 11 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. In any prosecution for criminal sexual penetration or criminal sexual contact of a minor, upon motion of the district attorney and after notice to the opposing counsel, the district court may, for a good cause shown, order the taking of a videotaped deposition of any alleged victim under the age of sixteen years. The videotaped deposition shall be taken before the judge in chambers in the presence of the district attorney, the defendant and his attorneys. Examination and cross-examination of the alleged victim shall proceed at the taking of the videotaped deposition in the same manner as permitted at trial under the provisions of Rule 611 of the New Mexico Rules of Evidence [Rule 11-611 NMRA]. Any videotaped deposition taken under the provisions of this act [this section] shall be viewed and heard at the trial and entered into the record in lieu of the direct testimony of the alleged victim.\n\nB. For the purposes of this section, \"videotaped deposition\" means the visual recording on a magnetic tape, together with the associated sound, of a witness testifying under oath in the course of a judicial proceeding, upon oral examination and where an opportunity is given for cross-examination in the presence of the defendant and intended to be played back upon the trial of the action in court.\n\nC. The supreme court may adopt rules of procedure and evidence to govern and implement the provisions of this act.\n\nD. The cost of such videotaping shall be paid by the state.\n\nE. Videotapes which are a part of the court record are subject to a protective order of the court for the purpose of protecting the privacy of the victim.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-9-27, enacted by Laws 1978, ch. 98, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nImplicit waiver of right to confrontation.— Where defendant at trial did not file a response to the state's motion for a videotaped deposition, nor did he object at the time of the taking of the deposition or at the time that the district court admitted the deposition tape as evidence, but, to the contrary, defendant relied on both the deposition tape and the interview tape in his opening and closing arguments, defendant's actions indicate that he implicitly waived his right to face-to-face confrontation by conduct.State v. Herrera, 2004-NMCA-015, 135 N.M. 79, 84 P.3d 696, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-001, 135 N.M. 160, 85 P.3d 802.\n\nDefendant absent from trial voluntarily.Factors articulated in State v. Clements, 1988-NMCA-094, 108 N.M. 13, 765 P.2d 1195, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 785, 765 P.2d 758, as to waiver of right to be present being occasioned by the voluntary absence of an accused, were to be applied only when the defendant was absent from trial voluntarily.State v. Rodriguez, 1992-NMCA-088, 114 N.M. 265, 837 P.2d 459.\n\nRecord insufficient to justify denial of right to confront victim.— Where a child was charged with criminal sexual contact with his sister, and, at trial, the victim testified in chambers with only counsel and the judge present and the accused observed the victim testify on a video monitor located in another room, the procedure was invalid without particularized findings of special harm to the particular child witness which are supported by substantial evidence, because the accused child's right of confrontation requires that he be permitted to confront each of the witnesses against him, including the child victim.State v. Benny E., 1990-NMCA-052, 110 N.M. 237, 794 P.2d 380.\n\nRight of confrontation not denied.— In a prosecution for criminal sexual contact with a minor, use of the victim's videotaped deposition did not deny the defendant the right of confrontation: the defendant was not deprived of his right to fairly and fully cross-examine the child during the deposition, and the jury, which heard the child's testimony and viewed the child, via videotape, while she testified, had an adequate opportunity to observe the child's demeanor.State v. Vigil, 1985-NMCA-103, 103 N.M. 583, 711 P.2d 28.\n\nVideotaping depositions of victims of sex crimes, while defendant was required to remain in a control room instead of the room in which the testimony was given, was consistent with this section and Rule 5-504 NMRA, and no violation of defendant's right to confrontation occurred.State v. Tafoya, 1988-NMCA-082, 108 N.M. 1, 765 P.2d 1183, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 785, 765 P.2d 758, cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1097, 109 S. Ct. 1572, 103 L. Ed. 2d 938 (1989).\n\nIn a prosecution for sexual abuse, trial judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the children to testify by way of depositions that were videotaped outside the presence of the defendant and then shown to the jury, as he made the requisite findings that the individualized harm which would otherwise result in the child victims outweighed the defendant's right to a face-to-face confrontation with his accusers.State v. Fairweather, 1993-NMSC-065, 116 N.M. 456, 863 P.2d 1077.\n\nShowing of traumatic effect.— Showing a traumatic effect upon the child is sufficient to render the child unavailable to testify.Vigil v. Tansy, 917 F.2d 1277 (10th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1100, 111 S. Ct. 995, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1078 (1991).\n\nDeposition need not be taken to charging paper on which defendant ultimately tried.— There is nothing in Rule 5-504 NMRA requiring a deposition to be taken pursuant to the charging paper upon which defendant is ultimately tried. A deposition may be taken pursuant to a complaint and then introduced at a trial on an indictment or information.State v. Larson, 1988-NMCA-019, 107 N.M. 85, 752 P.2d 1101, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 74, 752 P.2d 789.\n\nSecond deposition admitted into evidence.— While it appears that the procedure outlined in this section and Rule 5-504 NMRA contemplates only one deposition, at which defense counsel should be on notice that this is his chance to confront the victim, although defendant never alerted the trial court why, following a deposition, a new video deposition was necessary, and he never specifically informed the appellate court, with references to the record, why a new video deposition was necessary, it could not be said that the trial court erred in allowing defendant to take a second deposition and then allowing both the first and second videotaped depositions into evidence.State v. Larson, 1988-NMCA-019, 107 N.M. 85, 752 P.2d 1101, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 74, 752 P.2d 789.\n\nMistrial declared where tape inaudible at trial.— Where videotape of testimony of 11-year-old victim of alleged criminal sexual penetration was inaudible at trial and child was unavailable to testify in person because of illness and possible emotional harm, there existed a manifest necessity for declaring a mistrial so that double jeopardy did not bar defendant's retrial.State v. Messier, 1984-NMCA-085, 101 N.M. 582, 686 P.2d 272.\n\nConsideration of whether evidence subject to public inspection.— Any determination of whether items of evidence are properly subject to public inspection and copying must necessarily consider the likelihood of injury to parties not involved in the particular case at bar.State ex rel. Bingaman v. Brennan, 1982-NMSC-059, 98 N.M. 109, 645 P.2d 982.\n\nWaiver of required state showing.— In a prosecution for criminal sexual penetration of a minor, since in order to gain a continuance the defendant had agreed to allow the admission of videotaped depositions at trial, he could not complain on appeal that the state failed to make the requisite showing for admissibility of the depositions.State v. Trujillo, 1995-NMCA-008, 119 N.M. 772, 895 P.2d 672, cert. quashed, 120 N.M. 394, 902 P.2d 76.\n\nOn appeal from a prosecution for criminal sexual contact of a minor, where defendant argued that the district court was constitutionally required to make specific findings justifying its substitution of videotaped testimony for face-to face confrontation, even though defendant never objected to the substitution, defendant waived his confrontation clause claim by failing to raise the confrontation issue at trial and there is no fundamental error.State v. Herrera, 2004-NMCA-015, 135 N.M. 79, 84 P.3d 696, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-001, 135 N.M. 160, 85 P.3d 802.\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of criminal procedure in New Mexico, see 18 N.M.L.
