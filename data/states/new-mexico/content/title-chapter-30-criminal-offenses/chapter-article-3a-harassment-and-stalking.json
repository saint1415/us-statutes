Whoever commits harassment is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 30-3A-2, enacted by Laws 1997, ch. 10, § 2.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1997, ch. 10, § 7, repealed 30-3A-2 NMSA 1978, as enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 86, § 2, and Laws 1997, ch. 10, § 2, enacted a new section, effective July 1, 1997.\n\nConstitutionality.— This section, as applied to defendant who repeatedly trespassed on victim's property, looked in her windows, and followed her both on and off her property, was not unconstitutionally vague; a person of ordinary intelligence would have known that such behavior was unlawful and would inflict substantial emotional distress upon the victim.State v. Duran, 1998-NMCA-153, 126 N.M. 60, 966 P.2d 768, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 533, 972 P.2d 352,overruled on other grounds,State v.

Stalking consists of knowingly pursuing a pattern of conduct, without lawful authority, directed at a specific individual when the person intends that the pattern of conduct would place the individual in reasonable apprehension of death, bodily harm, sexual assault, confinement or restraint of the individual or another individual.\n\nB. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"lawful authority\" means within the scope of lawful employment or constitutionally protected activity; and\n\n(2) \"pattern of conduct\" means two or more acts, on more than one occasion, in which the alleged stalker by any action, method, device or means, directly, indirectly or through third parties, follows, monitors, surveils, threatens or communicates to or about a person.\n\nC. Whoever commits stalking is guilty of a misdemeanor. Upon a second or subsequent conviction, the offender is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nD.

Aggravated stalking consists of stalking perpetrated by a person:\n\n(1) who knowingly violates a permanent or temporary order of protection issued by a court, except that mutual violations of such orders may constitute a defense to aggravated stalking;\n\n(2) in violation of a court order setting conditions of release and bond;\n\n(3) when the person is in possession of a deadly weapon; or\n\n(4) when the victim is less than sixteen years of age.\n\nB. Whoever commits aggravated stalking is guilty of a fourth degree felony. Upon a second or subsequent conviction, the offender is guilty of a third degree felony.\n\nC. In addition to any punishment provided pursuant to the provisions of this section, the court shall order a person convicted of aggravated stalking to participate in and complete a program of professional counseling at his own expense.\n\nHistory:Laws 1997, ch. 10, § 4.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 1997, ch. 10, § 8 made the Harassment and Stalking Act effective July 1, 1997.\n\nProof of intent.— Although aggravated stalking need not be construed as requiring, like aggravated assault, some use of a weapon, it is reasonable to construe the aggravated stalking statute as requiring some intent to use a weapon not specifically named or specifically described in 30-1-12B NMSA 1978 as a weapon.State v. Anderson, 2001-NMCA-027, 130 N.M. 295, 24 P.3d 327.\n\nJury instruction.— Under an aggravated stalking charge, when the object or instrument in question is an unlisted one that falls within the catchall language of 30-1-12B NMSA 1978, the jury must be instructed (1) that the defendant must have possessed the object or instrument with the intent to use it as a weapon, and (2) the object or instrument is one that, if so used, could inflict dangerous wounds.State v. Anderson, 2001-NMCA-027, 130 N.M. 295, 24 P.3d 327.\n\nThe aggravated stalking statute is not unconstitutionally vague.State v. Smile, 2009-NMCA-064, 146 N.M. 525, 212 P.3d 413, cert. quashed, 2010-NMCERT-006, 148 N.M. 582, 241 P.3d 180.\n\nThe aggravated stalking statute requires only one act in furtherance of a pattern of stalking.State v. Smile, 2009-NMCA-064, 146 N.M. 525, 212 P.3d 413, cert. quashed, 2010-NMCERT-006, 148 N.M. 582, 241 P.3d 180.\n\nSufficient evidence.— Where the victim of the defendant's stalking attempted to end the relationship between the defendant and the victim; the defendant threatened to kill the victim and to damage the victim's car, left threatening letters in the victim's mailbox and made threatening phone calls to the victim's father; the victim obtained a temporary restraining order against the defendant; before the TRO was served, the defendant appeared at the victim's apartment with Ninja-style knives, told police officers that the defendant was at the apartment to put the fear of God into the victim; when the TRO was served on the defendant, the defendant stated that a piece of paper would not stop the defendant from inflicting pain and fear on the victim; and the victim found a copy of the TRO in the door of the apartment with a threatening message written by the defendant, the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction of aggravated stalking.State v. Smile, 2009-NMCA-064, 146 N.M. 525, 212 P.3d 413, cert. quashed, 2010-NMCERT-006, 148 N.M. 582, 241 P.3d 180.",
