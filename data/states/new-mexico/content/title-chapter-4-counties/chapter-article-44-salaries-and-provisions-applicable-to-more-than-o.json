For the purpose of fixing salaries of county officers, the several counties of the state, except \"H\" class counties, are classified as follows:\n\n(1) those having a final, full assessed valuation of over seventy-five million dollars ($75,000,000) and a population of one hundred thousand persons or more as determined by the most current annual population data or estimate available from the United States census bureau, as class \"A\" counties; and\n\n(2) those having a final, full assessed valuation of over seventy-five million dollars ($75,000,000) and a population of less than one hundred thousand persons as determined by the most current annual population data or estimate available from the United States census bureau, as class \"B\" counties.\n\nB.

      "text": "From and after January 1, 1962, the classification of counties shall be fixed and governed by the assessed valuation as finally fixed for the preceding year. Provided, one hundred twenty days after January 1, 1962 and one hundred twenty days from January 1 of each second year thereafter, the classification shall be determined by the secretary of finance and administration from the assessed valuation of each county as finally fixed for the preceding year, and the secretary of finance and administration upon making the determination shall notify the board of county commissioners of each county of the class within which each of the counties of this state falls according to the classification, and the classification as so fixed and determined by the secretary of finance and administration shall govern the salaries of the county officers for two years beginning July 1 of the year the classification is determined.\n\nHistory:Laws 1915, ch. 12, § 19; 1923, ch. 49, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 33-3219; 1941 Comp., § 15-4102; Laws 1953, ch. 83, § 1; 1953, ch. 117, § 2; 1953 Comp., § 15-43-2; Laws 1961, ch. 184, § 1; 1977, ch. 247, § 143; 2009, ch. 224, § 2.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective June 19, 2009, at the end of the last sentence, after \"two years beginning\", deleted \"January 1, 1963 and each two years thereafter\" and added \"July 1 of the year the classification is determined\".\n\nConstitutionality of 1923 amendment.— Laws of 1923, ch. 49, § 2, providing for classification of counties on basis of assessed valuation in 1922 and determination of county salaries for 1923 and 1924 on the basis of such classification, was void insofar as it increased or diminished an officer's compensation during his term of office; the remaining portions of the act were unaffected.State ex rel. Gilbert v. Board of Comm'rs, 1924-NMSC-001, 29 N.M. 209, 222 P. 654, 31 A.L.R. 1310 (1924).\n\nThe compensation of a county officer may not be diminished during his term of office;both this article and N.M. Const., art. IV, § 27 prohibit such a reduction in compensation.State ex rel. Gilbert v. Board of Comm'rs, 1924-NMSC-001, 29 N.M. 209, 222 P. 654.\n\nThe tax commission (now secretary of finance and administration) has not the power to reduce salaries of county officersby the reclassification of counties. 1923 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 23-3665.\n\nClassification of counties is fixed by assessed valuation for prior yearwhich does not include exempted property. 1937 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 37-1705.\n\nEffect of reducing assessment.— When classification of county has been fixed by assessed valuation, a reduction of any assessment does not upset such classification. 1937 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 37-1525.\n\nErroneous valuation.— Where the valuation of property of a county, which determines its classification, was erroneous because of an omission in assessment which has been corrected by petition filed in district court of such county, it would seem that as a matter of right and justice the true valuation as shown by such court should be used to fix such classification, but the tax commission (now secretary of finance and administration) has no power or authority to revise the budget in order to increase salary fund to pay county officers. 1922 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 22-3603; 1937 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 37-1536.\n\nOfficial determination of a change in classificationby the state auditor (now secretary of finance and administration) is necessary before it can be made effective. 1948 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 48-5136; 1950 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 50-5285.",

      "text": "A. Each county sheriff, jail administrator or independent contractor shall keep a written record showing the exact time of confinement and release of each prisoner incarcerated in the jail under his jurisdiction. As used in this act, \"jail administrator\" means the person hired by a county, municipality or a combination of these who supervises the entire operation of the jail and reports directly to the administrative head of the local governmental entity or local governing body.\n\nB. The governing body of a jail shall, from appropriate funds, provide the necessary funding to maintain and operate the facility.\n\nC. All fees remitted to the sheriff or jail administrator for federal or other prisoners in his custody shall be promptly deposited in their entirety by the sheriff or jail administrator with the appropriate depository entity. As used in this section, \"depository entity\" means the treasurer of the particular local governmental entity responsible for management of the jail.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 15-43-14.1, enacted by Laws 1961, ch. 253, § 7; 1969, ch. 187, § 1; 1975, ch. 118, § 1; 1977, ch. 107, § 1; 1983, ch. 181, § 1; 1984, ch. 22, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For reimbursement of sheriff for feeding prisoners in transit,see4-44-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor contracts for operation of jail by independent contractor not constituting creation of debt,see6-6-12 NMSA 1978.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The term \"this act,\" referred to in the second sentence in Subsection A, means Laws 1983, Chapter 181, which appears as 4-44-19, 4-44-20, 33-3-1, 33-3-2, 33-3-4 to 33-3-9, 33-3-11 to 33-3-13, 33-3-18, 33-3-19 and 33-3-21 to 33-3-23 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe following opinions were rendered prior to the 1983 and 1984 amendments. This section no longer refers specifically to \"feeding\" or \"care\" of prisoners and contains no specific maximum amount for expenditures.\n\nItemized statement required.— Before sheriff is paid for feeding prisoners and guards, he must furnish itemized statement of actual costs so that account may be examined and its correctness tested. 1931 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 31-184.\n\nAuthority to contract with city for feeding of prisoners.— County commissioners can enter into a legal contract with a city, providing for the feeding of prisoners, and be reimbursed the actual cost of feeding city prisoners. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-56.\n\nCare and feeding of federal prisoners.— The keeping of prisoners for the federal government should be fixed by agreement between the county commissioners and the government to fairly compensate the county for such services. 1938 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 38-2034.\n\nDisposition of allowance paid for federal prisoners.— Although an allowance of $.75 per day was made by the United States for the care, guarding, housing and maintenance of federal prisoners, it was not for food alone, and should have been paid into the county treasury, and feeding of all prisoners should have been under this section. 1930 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 30-17.\n\nReimbursement process for maintenance of federal prisoners.— Money received by sheriff under contract with federal government for feeding and maintaining federal prisoners must be paid to county treasurer and the sheriff is entitled to collect reimbursement from the general county fund for the actual cost, not to exceed the maximum legal rate. 1947 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 47-5069.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Prisoners Are People,\" see 10 Nat. Resources J. 869 (1970).",

      "text": "Before assuming the duties of his office, each deputy county officer shall take and subscribe the oath of office prescribed by the constitution for county officers. The board of county commissioners may cause to be bonded the deputy or deputies of the various county officials who are not otherwise required to be bonded. These bonds shall be in amounts fixed by the board of county commissioners in a sum equal to twenty percent of the public money handled during the preceding fiscal year and conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties, but in no event shall the amount be greater than the maximum prescribed by law for the appropriate elected officer. The bonds shall be executed by corporate surety companies authorized to do business in this state and the premiums shall be paid from the county general fund. Deputy county officers may be individually bonded or included within the coverage under any schedule or blanket corporate surety bond procured by the board of county commissioners.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 15-4127, enacted by Laws 1945, ch. 68, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 15-43-30; Laws 1967, ch. 238, § 7.\n\nCross references.— For oath and bond of county officers and deputies generally,see10-1-13 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor bonds of county officers,see10-2-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nThe bond provided for under this section should be made to run to the stateof New Mexico or the county official, and this section authorizes the payment of the premium for such bond from county funds. 1945 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 45-4743.\n\nPayment of premium on bond.— The provisions of this section being mandatory in form, the board of county commissioners cannot refuse to approve payment of the premium on the bond from county funds. 1947 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 47-4975.\n\nLiability for acts of deputy treasurer.— No statute requires that deputy treasurers be bonded, and while it is good business for bonding companies liable on a county treasurer's bond, and also good business for the county treasurer to require that deputy treasurers be bonded for their protection, the county should not pay for the premium on such deputy's bond, since the state and county are protected on the treasurer's bond for any defalcation, even by a deputy under Section 6-10-38 NMSA 1978. 1940 Op.
