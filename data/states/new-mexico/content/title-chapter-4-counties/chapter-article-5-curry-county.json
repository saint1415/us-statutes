The boundary description does not take into account a correction in range line between ranges 30 and 31 east on the first standard parallel north. North of this parallel the range line, and therefore the county line, is displaced a distance of about 2 miles to the east.\n\nThis section was compiled in art. 4 of ch. 24 of the 1915 Code. It was not reenacted by its inclusion therein, but was compiled for convenience.Seethe 1915 Code, p. 1665.\n\nLaws 1909, ch. 6, § 2, provided for a temporary county seat and the selection of a permanent one.",
