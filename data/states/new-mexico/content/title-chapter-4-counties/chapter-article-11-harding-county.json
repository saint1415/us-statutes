      "text": "That the county of Harding is hereby created out of that portion of the state of New Mexico lying and being situate within the following metes and bounds, to wit:\n\nbeginning at a point on the present west boundary of the county of Union, the same being the township corner of townships 22 and 23 north, ranges 27 and 28 east, thence north 2 [3] miles along the range line between ranges 27 and 28 east to the section corner, and point where the present north boundary of Mora county intersects the present west boundary of Union county; thence west along the present north boundary of Mora county to a point where said north boundary intersects the center of the main channel of Red river; thence southerly meandering the center of the main channel of said Red river to a point where the said center of the main channel of Red river intersects the present south boundary of the county of Mora; thence east along the present south boundary of the county of Mora to a point where said line intersects the present west boundary of the county of Union; thence southerly and southeasterly along the present west boundary of Union county and along the northeast boundary of the Pablo Montoya grant to a point where said eastern boundary intersects the north line of the Baca location no. 2; thence east along the north line of the Baca location no. 2 to the northeast corner of said Baca location no. 2; thence south along the east line of the Baca location no. 2 to a point where said line intersects the township line between townships 13 and 14 north being the third standard parallel north [sic]; thence east along said third standard parallel north [township line] to a point where the same intersects the northwesterly boundary line of the right-of-way of the Rock Island railroad; thence northeasterly along the said north line of said right-of-way to a point where said line intersects the range line between ranges 33 and 34 east; thence north along the range line between ranges 33 and 34 east to a point where said range line intersects the township line between townships 21 and 22 north; thence west along the township line between [townships] 21 and 22 north to its intersection with range line between ranges 29 and 30 east; thence north along the range line between 29 and 30 east to the intersection of said range line with the township line between townships 22 and 23 north; thence west to the intersection of the same with the range line between ranges 27 and 28 east and the point of beginning.\n\nHistory:Laws 1921, ch. 48, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 33-1001; 1941 Comp., § 15-1001; 1953 Comp., § 15-11-1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Since 1941 changes have been made between Harding and Quay counties and Harding and San Miguel counties. Legal descriptions of the changes are available in district court files of the respective counties.\n\nHarding county was created out of Mora and Union counties. The northeast boundary of Mora county [southeast boundary of Colfax county] follows the center of township 23 north [4-4-2 NMSA 1978]. The line from the corner common to townships 22 and 23 north and ranges 27 and 28 east must, therefore, extend north 3 rather than 2 miles to intersect this line. This correction was indicated by the compiler of the 1941 Code by inserting in brackets the correct number. There are 2 east-west adjustments in the range line between ranges 33 and 34 east along the east side of the county which are not described in this section. These occur on the fourth and fifth standard parallels north, the amounts of displacement in each case being small. The township line between townships 13 and 14 north is not the third standard parallel north. This correction was also indicated by the compiler of the 1941 Code by placing the incorrect portion in parentheses and by inserting in brackets the words \"township line\" necessary for a correct reading of the section.\n\nCross references.— For boundaries of Mora county,see4-18-1 to 4-18-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor boundaries of Quay county,see4-20-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor boundaries of San Miguel county,see4-25-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor boundaries of Union county,see4-31-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nLegislative intention.— It was the intention of the legislature that Harding county was to function from June 20, 1921, that it was authorized to make special tax levies, and to anticipate their collection by issuing certificates of indebtedness not to exceed $30,000, payable in five years and that the proceeds of the levies were to be used exclusively to pay such indebtedness.State v. Southern Pac. Co., 1929-NMSC-027, 34 N.M. 306, 281 P. 29.",

      "heading": "[Bonds for courthouse and jail.]",
      "text": "The county of Harding may issue bonds for courthouse and jail purposes to an amount not exceeding twenty-five thousand ($25,000) dollars, which bonds shall be issued in the manner as provided by the constitution and the laws of the state of New Mexico, payable absolutely thirty years from their date, and, at the option of the county, twenty years from their date.\n\nHistory:Laws 1921, ch. 48, § 18; C.S. 1929, § 33-1018; 1941 Comp., § 15-1004; 1953 Comp., § 15-11-4.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 1921, ch. 48, §§ 19 and 20 provided for the creation of a county high school. Such provision was held unconstitutional in State ex rel. Bd. of Educ. v. Saint, 28 N.M. 165, 210 P. 573 (1922).\n\nCross references.— For bonds for courthouses, jails, bridges, hospitals and libraries,see4-49-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor state, county and municipal indebtedness,seeN.M. Const., art. IX, § 1 et seq.\n\nConstitutionality.— This section is not a violation of N.M. Const., art. IV, § 24, prohibiting special legislation.Martinez v. Gallegos, 1922-NMSC-053, 28 N.M. 170, 210 P. 575.\n\nIssuance of bonds without election.— This section authorizes the county created to issue bonds for courthouse and jail purposes without submission to a vote of the people as required by N.M. Const., art. IX, § 10.Martinez v. Gallegos, 1922-NMSC-053, 28 N.M. 170, 210 P. 575.\n\nParties bound by judgment in suit relating to bonds.— Where suit was brought to determine rights under this section by a qualified citizen in behalf of himself and others similarly situated, all such other citizens were parties by representation and were bound by the judgment as to matters litigated or which might have been litigated, the same as actual parties to the record, regardless of whether they had actual notice of the pendency of the suit.Floersheim v. Board of Comm'rs, 1922-NMSC-070, 28 N.M. 330, 212 P. 451.\n\nAction to enjoin issuance of bonds barred by former adjudication.— Where the allegations of a complaint to enjoin the issue of certain bonds did not state a new or different cause of action from those pleaded in a former adjudication of the same matter, in which all interested parties were joined by representation, the suit was barred by former adjudication.Floersheim v. Board of Comm'rs, 1922-NMSC-070, 28 N.M. 330, 212 P. 451.",
