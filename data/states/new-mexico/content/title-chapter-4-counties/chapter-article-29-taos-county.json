Mora county was created from the eastern part of Taos county, and Colfax county was later created from the northern part of Mora county.\n\nThe boundary between Taos and Colfax counties may be described as follows: commencing on the township line between townships 23 and 24 north at a point where it intersects the summit of the divide between the Rio Grande and the Canadian rivers; thence northerly [description based on 4-18-2 NMSA 1978] along the summit of the divide to the southern base of Osha hill; thence northerly along the crest of Osha hill to the southwest corner of the Maxwell Land Grant; thence northerly along the western boundary of the Maxwell Land Grant (which generally follows the summit of the divide) to its junction with the eastern boundary of the Sangre de Cristo Grant; thence northerly along the eastern boundary of the Sangre de Cristo Grant to the Colorado-New Mexico state line.\n\nThe boundary with Mora county is described in 4-18-1 and 4-18-2 NMSA 1978 and compiler's notes thereunder.\n\nThe southern boundary with Rio Arriba county is described in this section and also the compiler's notes under 4-21-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe western boundary with Rio Arriba county was altered by Laws 1880, ch. 46, § 2, which read: \"Hereafter all that portion of the county of Taos, on the west side of the public road leading from the Hot Springs in the county of Rio Arriba, to Conejos, in the state of Colorado, is hereby annexed to the county of Rio Arriba.\"\n\nThe boundary with Rio Arriba county west of the Rio Grande is described in 4-21-2 NMSA 1978 and the compiler's notes under 4-21-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe north boundary of Taos county is the state line.\n\nThis section was incorporated in article 22, chapter 24 of the 1915 Code. It was not reenacted by its inclusion therein, but was compiled merely for convenience.Seethe 1915 Code, p. 1665.\n\nCross references.— For boundaries of Colfax county,see4-4-1 to 4-4-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor boundaries of Mora county,see4-18-1 to 4-18-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor boundaries of Rio Arriba county,see4-21-1 and 4-21-2 NMSA 1978.",
