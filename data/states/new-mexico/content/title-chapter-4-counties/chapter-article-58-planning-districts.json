All or part of the state and local funds or services, or both, may be used to qualify for matching federal funds to be used for the purposes of the Planning District Act. If any planning and development district does not qualify for the total amount of grants-in-aid allocated to it during any fiscal year because of the lack of required matching funds or services, or both, from nonfederal local or private sources, the amount thereof for which the district does not qualify shall revert to the state general fund and shall not be apportioned for payment to any other district.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 15-59-6, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 298, § 6; 1977, ch. 247, § 145; 1983, ch. 296, § 14.\n\nCross references.— For planning powers and duties of the secretary of the department of finance and administration,see9-6-5.1 NMSA 1978.",
