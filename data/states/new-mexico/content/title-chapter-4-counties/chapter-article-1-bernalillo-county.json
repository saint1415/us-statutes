[The Bernalillo-Valencia line from the Canon del Infierno (Hell canyon) to the old boundary between the two counties is not defined by law. The accepted boundary seems to be that described in the last two clauses above.]\n\nA change in the boundary between Santa Fe and Bernalillo counties was also made by Laws 1891, ch. 55 (Code 1915, § 1063; C.S. 1929, § 33-102; 1941 Comp., § 15-101, n.) which read: \"After February 25, 1891, the dividing line between the counties of Santa Fe and Bernalillo shall be as follows: commencing at the southeast corner of township 9 north, of range 11 east, on the second correction line north, according to the United States public land surveys in New Mexico; thence running west along said correction line between townships 8 and 9 north, to the southwest corner of township 9 north, range 7 east, and from thence north along the dividing line between ranges 6 and 7 east to a point due west of the northwest corner of the tract of land known as the Mesita de Juana Lopez grant, as established by the surveys made by the government of the United States; thence due east to said northwest corner; thence due north 1 mile to a point; thence due west to the said dividing line between ranges 6 and 7 east; thence north along said dividing line to the northwest corner of the county of Santa Fe as at present established; it being understood that all of the country adjacent to the above-described lines, from the point of commencement on the south side and the west side thereof as far north as the present northern boundary of the county of Bernalillo, shall hereafter be a part of the county of Bernalillo.\"\n\nThe sections in this article were compiled respectively in art. 1 and art. 25 of ch. 24 of the 1915 Code. They were not reenacted by their inclusion therein, but were compiled for convenience.Seethe 1915 Code, p. 1665.\n\nCross references.— For boundaries of San Miguel county,see4-25-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor creation or change of counties,see4-33-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor change of county seats,see4-34-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor prohibition against local or special laws locating or changing county seats or changing county lines, except in creating new counties,seeN.M.
