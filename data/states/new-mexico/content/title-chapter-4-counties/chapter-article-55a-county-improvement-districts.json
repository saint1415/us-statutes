      "text": "A. If in connection with the creation of the improvement district the board determines that it is in the best interest of the county to finance the district improvements by the imposition of an improvement district property tax and the issuance of improvement district general obligation bonds, the board shall enact an ordinance making the determination and provide in the ordinance the improvement district property tax rate to be imposed; the date, which may be a predetermined date or a date to be established in the future after completion of the improvements, of commencement of the tax; the amount of the bonds to be issued to finance the improvements; and any other matters the board deems necessary or appropriate. The board shall call an election within the improvement district for the purpose of authorizing the board to issue general obligation bonds, the proceeds of the sale of which shall be used for constructing the improvements for which the district was created and to impose property taxes on all taxable property within the district for the purpose of paying the principal, debt service and other expenses incidental to the issuance and sale of the bonds. The ordinance shall also include procedures for the conduct of the election based upon the size of the improvement district and the number of voters entitled to vote.\n\nB. If at the election described in Subsection A of this section the property tax imposition and the issuance of improvement district general obligation bonds are approved by a majority of the voters voting on the issues, the board shall impose the tax at a rate sufficient to pay the debt service on the bonds and retire them at maturity.\n\nC. Imposition and collection of the improvement district property tax authorized in this section shall be made at the same time and in the same manner as impositions and collections of property taxes for use by counties are made.\n\nD. Bonds issued by the board for payment of the specified improvement district improvements shall be sold at a price that does not result in a net effective interest rate exceeding the maximum net effective interest rate permitted by the Public Securities Act [6-14-1 to 6-14-3 NMSA 1978]. The bonds may be sold at public or private sale and may be in denominations that the board determines.\n\nE. The form and terms of the bonds, including a final maturity of thirty years and provisions for their payment and redemption, shall be as determined by the board. The bonds shall be executed in the name of and on behalf of the improvement district by the chairman of the board. The bonds may be executed and sealed in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Facsimile Signature of Public Officials Act [6-9-1 to 6-9-6 NMSA 1978].\n\nF. To provide for the payment of the interest and principal of the bonds issued and sold pursuant to this section, the board shall annually impose a property tax on all taxable property in the district in an amount sufficient to produce a sum equal to the principal and interest on all bonds as they mature.\n\nG. The bonds authorized in this section are general obligation bonds of the district, and the full faith and credit of the district are pledged to the payment of the bonds. The proceeds obtained from the issuance of the bonds shall not be diverted or expended for any purposes other than those provided in the County Improvement District Act.\n\nH. All bonds issued by an improvement district shall be fully negotiable and constitute negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all the purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code [Chapter 55 NMSA 1978]. If lost or completely destroyed, any bond may be reissued in the form and tenor of the lost or destroyed bond upon the owner furnishing to the satisfaction of the board:\n\n(1) proof of ownership;\n\n(2) proof of loss or destruction;\n\n(3) a surety bond in twice the face amount of the bond and coupons; and\n\n(4) payment of the cost of preparing and issuing the new bond and coupons.\n\nI. The board may in any proceedings authorizing improvement district bonds provide for the initial issuance of one or more bonds aggregating the amount of the entire issue or may make provision for installment payments of the principal amount of any bond as it may consider desirable.\n\nJ. The board may issue bonds to be denominated refunding bonds, for the purpose of refunding any of the general obligation bonded indebtedness of the district. Whenever the board deems it expedient to issue refunding bonds, it shall adopt a resolution setting out the facts making the issuance of the refunding bonds necessary or advisable, the determination of the necessity or advisability by the board and the amount of refunding bonds that the board deems necessary and advisable to issue. The resolution shall fix the form of the bonds; the rate or rates of interest of the bonds, but the net effective interest rate of the bonds shall not exceed the maximum net effective interest rate permitted by the Public Securities Act [6-14-1 to 6-14-3 NMSA 1978]; the date of the refunding bonds; the denominations of the refunding bonds; the maturity dates; and the place or places of payment within or without the state of both principal and interest. Refunding bonds when issued, except for bonds issued in book entry or similar form without the delivery of physical securities, shall be negotiable in form and shall bear the signature or the facsimile signature of the chairman of the board. All refunding bonds may be exchanged dollar for dollar for the bonds to be refunded or they may be sold as directed by the board, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied only to the purpose for which the bonds were issued and the payment of any incidental expenses.\n\nK. The principal amount of improvement district general obligation bonds that may be issued by the board for any improvement district shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the final estimated value of properties in the improvement district after completion of the projects to be financed with the improvement district general obligation bonds and after development of the properties in the improvement district in accordance with their planned use, as determined by the board with the assistance of the engineer and other qualified professionals.\n\nL. In connection with an improvement district project to be financed with the proceeds of improvement district general obligation bonds issued pursuant to this section, a property owner subject to the improvement district property tax or the board may enter into contracts to design, engineer, finance, construct or acquire a project with contractors and professionals, on such terms and with such persons as the property owner subject to the improvement district property tax or the board determines to be appropriate, without following the procedures or meeting the requirements of the Procurement Code [13-1-28 to 13-1-199 NMSA 1978] or the requirements of Sections 6-15-1 through 6-15-22 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 4-55A-12.1, enacted by Laws 1998, ch. 47, § 7; 2001, ch. 312, § 12.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, inserted \"improvement district property\" preceding \"tax rate to be imposed\" and inserted the language following the latter phrase through \"commencement of the tax\" in the first sentence of Subsection A; inserted \"improvement\" following \"an election within the\" in the second sentence of Subsection A; deleted the former penultimate sentence in Subsection A concerning a limitation on the tax rate; in Subsection B, deleted \"not to exceed the limitation in Subsection A of this section and\"; in Subsection E, inserted \"a final maturity of thirty years\" and \"by the chairman of the board\"; in Subsection F, deleted \"subject to the limitation of Subsection A of this section\" from the end of the subsection; in Subsection J, deleted \"and shall be attested to by the secretary of the board\" from the end of the penultimate sentence; and added Subsections K and L.",

Unmatured installments are not deemed to be within the terms of any general covenant or warranty. All purchasers, mortgagees or encumbrancers of a tract or parcel of land so assessed shall hold the tract or parcel of land subject to the lien so created unless the assessment lien is adjusted pursuant to this section.\n\nC.
