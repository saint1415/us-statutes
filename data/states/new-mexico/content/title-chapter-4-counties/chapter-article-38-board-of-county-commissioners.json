      "heading": "[Exercise of county powers.]Section 4-38-2 - Members; quorum",
      "text": "The powers of a county as a body politic and corporate shall be exercised by a board of county commissioners.\n\nHistory:Laws 1876, ch. 1, § 3; C.L. 1884, § 334; C.L. 1897, § 653; Code 1915, § 1188; C.S. 1929, § 33-4201; 1941 Comp., § 15-3501; 1953 Comp., § 15-37-1.\n\nCross references.— For powers of counties generally,see4-37-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor management powers of board generally,see4-38-18 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor filling of vacancies in legislative offices,seeN.M. Const., art. IV, § 4.\n\nFor control of property of disincorporated municipalities,see3-4-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor subdivision planning,see3-20-5 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor investigation of bonds of county and precinct officers,see10-2-12 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor filling of vacancies in county and precinct offices,see10-3-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor liability of governmental entities and public employees,see41-4-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor subdivision regulation,see47-6-9 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nGovernment of county vested in boards of county commissioners.— By the 1876 act of which this section was a part, it was evidently intended that the government of the county should pass from the probate judge to the boards of county commissioners.Coler v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1891-NMSC-024, 6 N.M. 88, 27 P. 619.\n\nAllocation of public funds.— Where a county or political subdivision is confronted with a shortage of available revenues, the county is invested with discretion concerning the allocation of public funds.Gallegos v. Trujillo, 1992-NMCA-090, 114 N.M. 435, 839 P.2d 645, cert. denied, 114 N.M. 314, 838 P.2d 468.\n\nInvestment decision-making.— The county treasurer determines how to deposit and invest county funds. That decision must then be approved by the board of county commissioners, sitting as the county board of finance. The board of finance has no power to modify the county treasurer's decision without the treasurer's concurrence. On the other hand, the county treasurer cannot impose a unilateral decision upon the board of finance.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Padilla, 1990-NMCA-125, 111 N.M. 278, 804 P.2d 1097.\n\nThere is no statutory prohibition against delegation to the county treasurer by the board of county commissioners, sitting as the county board of finance, of specific investment decision-making. For example, the board could adopt a policy and permit the treasurer to make investment decisions that conform to the policy. Such delegation may be essential to enable the treasurer to respond to sudden changes in the financial markets.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Padilla, 1990-NMCA-125, 111 N.M. 278, 804 P.2d 1097.\n\nAdoption of merit system or approval of collective-bargaining agreement.— There is no statutory impediment in general to the adoption by the board of county commissioners of a merit system or approval of a collective-bargaining agreement that includes at least some employees of the county treasurer.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Padilla, 1990-NMCA-125, 111 N.M. 278, 804 P.2d 1097.\n\nA board of county commissioners does not unlawfully infringe upon a county treasurer's prerogatives unless it undermines the treasurer's ability to perform the duties of the office by means that are not granted to the board by statute. Ordinances providing for merit systems or collective-bargaining agreements can pass that test.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Padilla, 1990-NMCA-125, 111 N.M. 278, 804 P.2d 1097.\n\nEmployment offer from two commissioners held invalid.— The action of two county commissioners orally extending an offer of a two-year employment was without statutory authority because it was not made at a duly constituted meeting of the board and, thus, it was not a valid act capable of binding the county.Trujillo v. Gonzales, 1987-NMSC-119, 106 N.M. 620, 747 P.2d 915.\n\nCounty officials are trustees for the people within the county.— As such, they are required to act with reasonable skill and diligence, and to discharge their duties with that prudence, caution and attention which careful men usually exercise in the management of their own affairs. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-149.\n\nGeneral superintending authority.— A county commission or a county council does not have any general superintending authority over other elected county officials. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-18.\n\nViolation of law.— Elected county officials who fail to perform their official duties are subject to removal, civil suit or criminal prosecution if they violate the law. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-18.\n\nOwnership, operation and maintenance of an airportis within the powers of the board of county commissioners. 1947 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 47-5007.\n\nClosing county offices on Saturdays.— In view of the language of the statutes and the holdings in the supreme court, the county commissioners in the various counties have the absolute power and discretion to determine if they should close the county offices on Saturdays. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6221.\n\nApproval of purchases must be made in public meeting.— A county commission may not, consistently with the Open Meetings Act, Chapter 10, Article 15 NMSA 1978, approve purchases by telephone. When it approves purchases, a county commission is conducting public business and taking official action. Therefore, to be valid, this action must be taken by the commissioners acting as a body at a meeting open to the public and according to the requirements of the Open Meetings Act. 1991 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 91-12.\n\nBoard of county commissioners may legally award a franchiseto a water company for the operation of a water system outside corporate limits of a municipality. 1946 Op. Att'y Gen.

      "text": "A. The board of county commissioners shall consist of either three or five qualified electors who shall be elected according to law. For a three-member board, two members constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting business. For a five-member board, three members constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting business.\n\nB. The board of county commissioners of any county having a population of more than one hundred thousand, as shown by the most recent federal decennial census, and having a final, full assessed valuation in excess of seventy-five million dollars ($75,000,000) shall consist of five qualified electors who shall be elected according to law.\n\nHistory:Laws 1876, ch. 1, § 8; C.L. 1884, § 339; C.L. 1897, § 658; Code 1915, § 1189; C.S. 1929, § 33-4202; 1941 Comp., § 15-3502; 1953 Comp., § 15-37-2; Laws 1974, ch. 21, § 1; 2002, ch. 61, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For classification of counties for salary purposes,see4-44-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor five member boards of county commissioners,seeN.M. Const., art. X, § 7.\n\nFor oath and bond of county officers,see10-1-13 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2002 amendment,effective May 15, 2002, in Subsection A, substituted \"either three or five qualified electors\" for \"three qualified electors any two of whom shall be competent to transact business\" in the first sentence, and added the second and third sentences; and in Subsection B, inserted \"federal\", and deleted the former last sentence, which read: \"For the purpose of transacting business, three members shall constitute a quorum.\"\n\nRelationship of constitutional provisions concerning office of county commissioner.— When N.M. Const., art. X, § 7, was added by constitutional amendment, the old § 2 of article X ceased to apply to counties having a population greater than 100,000 and an assessed valuation greater than $75,000,000. Under N.M. Const., art. X, § 7, the original offices of county commissioner for two-year terms in affected counties were in effect abolished and new offices of county commissioner for two four-year terms were created, notwithstanding that the new constitutional provision does not expressly say that the old offices were abolished and new ones created.Morris v. Gonzales, 1978-NMSC-026, 91 N.M. 495, 576 P.2d 755.\n\nPermissible terms of office.— A county commissioner who has previously served a two-year term as county commissioner under N.M. Const., art. X, § 2, and one four-year term under N.M. Const., art. X, § 7, may serve an additional four-year term under N.M. Const., art. X, § 7.Morris v. Gonzales, 1978-NMSC-026, 91 N.M. 495, 576 P.2d 755.\n\nConstitutionality of scheme for election of county commissioners.— Statutory provisions for election of county commissioners from five separate voting districts in certain heavily populated counties does not deny equal protection under federal constitution to residents of less heavily populated counties where three county commissioners are elected at large, since classification between heavily populated counties, with a greater variety of social and economic needs of the populace, and more rural counties, where needs of the general populace were likely to be similar, has a substantial and reasonable relation to the subject matter involved.Pierce v. King, 373 F. Supp. 1130 (D.N.M. 1974).\n\nEligibility of county employee for office of county commissioner.— A school bus driver, employed by the county, is eligible to be a candidate and may run for election for the office of county commissioner if he is a qualified elector and is not otherwise disqualified generally by reason of the disqualification spelled out in the New Mexico constitution. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-210.\n\nThere is no statute prohibiting a county commissioner from accepting another office.The office is not incompatible with an office under the cattle sanitary board (now New Mexico livestock board) or the state highway department. 1939 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 39-3137.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 56 Am.

      "text": "A. A county having a population greater than thirteen thousand, according to the most recent federal decennial census, shall be divided by the board of county commissioners into as many compact single-member districts as there are board members to be elected. The districts shall be as equal in population as possible and numbered respectively to correspond to the number of board members. One commissioner shall be elected from each district by the voters of the district and shall be a resident of the district from which he is elected. If a commissioner permanently removes his residence from or maintains no residence in the district from which he was elected, he shall be deemed to have resigned. The division of the county into single-member districts shall be made once immediately following each federal decennial census.\n\nB. An H class county or a county having a population of thirteen thousand or fewer according to the most recent federal decennial census, may be divided by the board of county commissioners into single-member districts. If the county is districted, the districts shall be as equal in population as possible and numbered respectively to correspond to the number of board members. A commissioner shall be a resident of the district from which he is elected. If a commissioner permanently removes his residence from or maintains no residence in the district from which he was elected, he shall be deemed to have resigned. The division of the county into single-member districts shall be made once immediately following each federal decennial census. The board of county commissioners in a county with only three board members may require either that:\n\n(1) commissioners shall be elected from each district by the voters of the whole county; or\n\n(2) each commissioner shall be elected by the voters of the district from which that commissioner is running for office.\n\nHistory:Laws 1876, ch. 1, § 10; 1880, ch. 19, § 1; C.L. 1884, § 341; C.L. 1897, § 660; Code 1915, § 1190; C.S. 1929, § 33-4203; 1941 Comp., § 15-3503; 1953 Comp., § 15-37-3; Laws 1959, ch. 106, § 1; 1961, ch. 27, § 1; 1974, ch. 21, § 2; 1985, ch. 204, § 1; 1987, ch. 290, § 1; 1991 (1st S.S.), ch. 5, § 1; 2002, ch. 61, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For election of county commissioners,see4-38-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor class H county,see4-44-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor authority of legislature to enact laws permitting division of counties into county commission districts and to provide that elective county commissioners reside in respective county commission districts,seeN.M. Const., art. V, § 13.\n\nFor qualifications for holding office generally,seeN.M. Const., art. VII, § 2.\n\nFor five member boards of county commissioners,seeN.M. Const., art. X, § 7.\n\nThe 2002 amendment,effective May 15, 2002, in Subsection A, inserted \"according to the most recent federal decennial census,\" in the first sentence, and inserted \"immediately following\" in the last sentence; and in Subsection B, inserted \"according to the most recent federal decennial census,\" in the present first sentence and added the remainder of the subsection.\n\nThe 1991 (1st S.S.) amendment,effective December 18, 1991, deleted the Subsection A designation and deleted former Subsection B, relating to division, based on census results, of counties having a population of over 100,000 and having a final, full assessed valuation in excess of $75,000,000.\n\nConstitutionality of scheme for election of county commissioners.— Statutory provisions for election of county commissioners from five separate voting districts in certain heavily populated counties does not deny equal protection under federal constitution to residents of less heavily populated counties where three county commissioners are elected at large, since classification between heavily populated counties, with a greater variety of social and economic needs of the populace, and more rural counties, where needs of the general populace were likely to be similar, has a substantial and reasonable relation to the subject matter involved.Pierce v. King, 373 F. Supp. 1130 (D.N.M. 1974).\n\nPower to draw boundaries for election of five member boards of county commissioners.State ex rel. Robinson v. King, 1974-NMSC-028, 86 N.M. 231, 522 P.2d 83 (decided prior to 1992 amendment to N.M. Const. art. X, § 7).\n\nResidency requirement.— A candidate for county commissioner must reside in the district in which he runs.Velasquez v. Chavez, 1984-NMSC-109, 102 N.M. 54, 691 P.2d 55.\n\nCandidates must be resident of district at time name certified.— A reason for restricting candidates to residents of the district from which they seek election is to insure that each elected commissioner has knowledge of the problems and the needs of the district from which he is elected. It is properly within the spirit of such restriction, and will promote efficient filing administration, to require that a candidate be a resident of the district from which he seeks election at the time his name is certified.State ex rel. Rudolph v. Lujan, 1973-NMSC-077, 85 N.M. 378, 512 P.2d 951.\n\nRedistricting.— If redistricting has not occurred within two years and in the board's discretion redistricting is needed and justifiable, the board of county commissioners may do so, filing a map and record of the change in the county clerk's office. 1941 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 41-3863 (rendered under prior law).\n\nCandidate for county commissioner must file in district of residency.— In order for a candidate for county commissioner to qualify for that office, he must file in the district where he resides. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-30.\n\nDeclaration of candidacy to be used in determining residency of candidate.— Since a candidate may move without changing his affidavit of registration, the address (or precinct) shown on the declaration of candidacy should be used in determining the candidate's precinct. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-30.\n\nInvestigation by county clerk of residency of candidate.— If the county clerk's office has any reason to believe that a person's residence is other than that shown on the declaration of candidacy, the county clerk should investigate to ascertain if the address (or precinct) shown on the declaration of candidacy is in fact the candidate's residency. The county clerk may use his staff to do so, or may call upon the services of the sheriff's office. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-30.\n\nResidency of persons appointed to fill vacancies.— Person appointed to fill vacancy in office of county commissioner must, at the time of appointment, be a resident of the commissioner district from which his predecessor was elected. 1916 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 16-1764.\n\nEffect of change of residence by county commissioner subsequent to election.— A county commissioner, once elected and qualified, does not lose his right to the office by change of residence, unless he removes entirely from the county. 1915 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 15-1516.\n\nWhere a county is divided and a new county is made,commissioners who reside in the new county forfeit their office as commissioners of the old county. 1918 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 18-2079.\n\nHolding of another office or position by county commissioner.— There is nothing in our statutes prohibiting a county commissioner from holding a position with the state administration, but under 10-3-1 NMSA 1978, his office would be vacated if he undertook to discharge the duties of an incompatible office. Whether it would be incompatible depends on the position itself. 1939 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 39-3196.\n\nIncompatible positions.— A person may serve as a member of the board of trustees of a town and county commissioner or county assessor at the same time unless the two offices held at the same time are considered legally incompatible. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-30.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— \"At-large\" elections as violation of § 2 of Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USCS § 1973), 92 A.L.R. Fed. 824.\n\n20 C.J.S.

The term \"county purposes\" means such enterprises as would not advance the wants and demands of the community independent of public aid. The building of courthouses, jails, poorhouses and common roads and bridges by which they are made accessible to the people are county purposes, while hotels and mercantile, trading, banking and manufacturing establishments would not be. Functions pertaining to legal aid, a health center, welfare services, employment, job training and counseling services and relocation and rehabilitation services would be of such a nature as to provide a primary benefit to the county in which they are situated. Therefore, they are county purposes and may be housed by the county. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen.
