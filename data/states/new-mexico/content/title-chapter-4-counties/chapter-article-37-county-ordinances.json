      "text": "All counties are granted the same powers that are granted municipalities except for those powers that are inconsistent with statutory or constitutional limitations placed on counties. Included in this grant of powers to the counties are those powers necessary and proper to provide for the safety, preserve the health, promote the prosperity and improve the morals, order, comfort and convenience of any county or its inhabitants. The board of county commissioners may make and publish any ordinance to discharge these powers not inconsistent with statutory or constitutional limitations placed on counties.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 15-36A-1, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 312, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For municipal ordinances,see3-17-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor powers of municipalities,see3-18-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor zoning regulations,see3-21-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nPowers.— A county is a political subdivision of the state and possesses only such powers as are expressly granted to it by the legislature, together with those necessarily implied to implement those express powers.El Dorado at Santa Fe, Inc. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs of Santa Fe Cnty., 1976-NMSC-029, 89 N.M. 313, 551 P.2d 1360.\n\nConstruction of grants of authority generally.— It is not necessary that grant of powers to counties or other municipal corporations contain a specification of each particular act to be done, but it is sufficient if the words used are sufficiently comprehensive to include the proposed acts; an express authority might be general as well as particular.Agua Pura Co. v. Mayor of Las Vegas, 1900-NMSC-002, 10 N.M. 6, 60 P. 208.\n\nPolice powers.— The legislature has conferred police powers to counties through Section 4-37-1 NMSA 1978.Brazos Land, Inc. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1993-NMCA-013, 115 N.M. 168, 848 P.2d 1095.\n\nGeneral police power and zoning ordinances.— Counties have statutory authority to enact general police power and zoning ordinances; however, enactment procedures and regulatory powers differ between the two.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. City of Las Vegas, 1980-NMSC-137, 95 N.M. 387, 622 P.2d 695.\n\nPreemption of local ordinances.— Under New Mexico law, there are three ways a state statute can preempt a local ordinance: 1) expressly, because the statute contains language stating that it preempts local ordinances, 2) impliedly, because the ordinance and the state statute conflict, or 3) impliedly, because the statute demonstrates an intent to occupy the entire field.Rancho Lobo, Ltd. v. Devargas, 303 F.3d 1195 (10th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 906, 123 S. Ct. 1483, 155 L. Ed. 2d 225 (2003).\n\nIn passing the Forest Conservation Act, 68-2-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., the legislature left room for concurrent jurisdiction over local forestry issues; thus, the act does not impliedly preempt a county ordinance, dealing,inter alia, with economic development, local employment, and hours of operation, by occupying the entire field of regulation relating to timber harvesting in New Mexico.Rancho Lobo, Ltd. v. Devargas, 303 F.3d 1195 (10th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 906, 123 S. Ct. 1483, 155 L. Ed. 2d 225 (2003).\n\nUnder New Mexico law, an ordinance is not necessarily invalid because it provides for greater restrictions than state law; rather, the test is whether the ordinance permits an act the general law prohibits or prohibits an act the general law permits.Rancho Lobo, Ltd. v. Devargas, 303 F.3d 1195 (10th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 906, 123 S. Ct. 1483, 155 L. Ed. 2d 225 (2003).\n\nEnforcement of zoning ordinances.— Although this section acknowledges that counties are granted the same powers granted to municipalities except for those powers that are inconsistent with the statutory or constitutional limitations placed on counties, the statute in no way provides an express grant of authority to enforce local zoning ordinances on state land.County of Santa Fe v. Milagro Wireless, LLC, 2001-NMCA-070, 130 N.M. 771, 32 P.3d 214.\n\nLeasing road equipment.— A county has the power to lease road equipment as a power included in the right to purchase.Allstate Leasing Corp. v. Board of County Comm'rs, 450 F.2d 26 (10th Cir. 1971).\n\nRoad construction and repair.— Counties possess the authority to construct or repair county roads within their boundaries.Bolton v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1994-NMCA-167, 119 N.M. 355, 890 P.2d 808, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 311, 889 P.2d 1233 (1995).\n\nRemoval of offices, property and prisoners to new county seat.— A county is a quasi-municipal corporation and among its definite powers is the power, coupled with a mandatory duty, to remove to new county seat, when properly selected, all county offices and property, and all county prisoners, if courthouse and jail are completed.Orchard v. Board of Comm'rs, 1938-NMSC-011, 42 N.M. 172, 76 P.2d 41.\n\nPower to adopt traffic ordinances.— Based on express provisions in the state Motor Vehicle Code [66-1-1 NMSA 1978] governing local authorities and the corresponding powers of counties and municipalities, a county has the statutory authority to adopt local traffic ordinances that are not inconsistent with the laws of the state.Board of Comm'rs v. Greacen, 2000-NMSC-016, 129 N.M. 177, 3 P.3d 672.\n\nOrdinance conflicted with free range of livestock management.— Where the county filed a criminal complaint against defendant for allowing defendant's cattle to run at large in violation of a county ordinance that made it unlawful for a person to allow or permit an animal to run at large; and the land in question was not within the boundary of a municipality, a conservancy district, or a military base, the metropolitan court properly dismissed the criminal complaint because the ordinance conflicted with New Mexico's free range or \"fence out\" approach to livestock management as expressed in Subsection C of Section 66-7-363 NMSA 1978 and Section 77-16-1 NMSA 1978, and the county did not have general authority to disallow the free running of livestock in unincorporated or open areas of their jurisdiction.Bernalillo Bd. of Co. Comm'rs v. Benavidez, 2013-NMCA-015, 292 P.3d 482, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-012.\n\nMerit system and collective bargaining.— A board of county commissioners has power to adopt a merit system for, and collectively bargain with, county employees.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Padilla, 1990-NMCA-125, 111 N.M. 278, 804 P.2d 1097.\n\nAuthority to charge franchise fee.— A county board of commissioners may enter into franchise agreements with utility companies and impose a franchise fee in exchange for the county's reasonable expenses incurred in granting the franchise and for the utilities' use of public highways, streets and alleys under the franchise agreements. 2014 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 14-01.\n\nPowers generally.— A county is merely a governmental unit of the state and possesses only such powers as are expressly or impliedly conferred upon it by constitutional provisions or legislative enactments. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-103.\n\nConsolidation of counties.— Two or more counties possess the authority to consolidate in accordance with 3-5-1 NMSA 1978. The counties, however, must be contiguous. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-55.\n\nThe legislature would be prohibited from passing a special law that would in effect or specifically abolish a county. When two or more counties consolidate under a general statute, however, they effectively are abolished, and a new entity would emerge. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-55.\n\nThe laws providing for annexation or consolidation of portions of counties provide no \"priorities\" among contiguous counties. The petition must accurately set out the boundaries of the county proposed to be annexed and must state to which county the residents desire to be annexed. The resolutions providing for consolidation must also include within their terms the counties to be consolidated. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-55.\n\nNo authority to call for referendum.— In the absence of a constitutional reservation of the right of the people to hold referendum on county ordinances, and in the absence of a specific statutory authority requiring a referendum on ordinances, there is no authority for a county to call a voluntary referendum. Should such a referendum be held, it would not, regardless of its outcome, affect the adoption or validity of the ordinance. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-35.\n\nCounty's proposed \"right to work\" ordinance would likely exceed the scope of authority granted to the county by the legislature.— In general, a New Mexico county possesses only such powers as are expressly granted to it by the legislature, together with those necessarily implied to implement those express powers, and where the legislature has granted counties the authority to provide for the safety, preserve the health, promote the prosperity and improve the morals, order, comfort and convenience of the county and its inhabitants, such a grant of authority does not encompass or include the authority to adopt an ordinance which regulates contracts between employees, employers, and unions, and therefore, where Sandoval county has proposed an ordinance that is intended to provide that no employee covered by the federal National Labor Relations Act need join or pay dues to a union, or refrain from joining a union, as a condition of employment, the proposed ordinance would exceed the scope of powers granted by the legislature.Sandoval County Right to Work Ordinance(1/18/18), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2018-03.\n\nFederal law preempts county's proposed \"right to work\" ordinance.— The federal National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) regulates private sector employment, governs matters of collective bargaining, and preempts, or precludes, state and other non-federal laws that attempt to regulate areas covered by the NLRA, and therefore, where Sandoval county has proposed an ordinance that is intended to provide that no employee covered by the federal NLRA need join or pay dues to a union, or refrain from joining a union, as a condition of employment, the proposed ordinance is preempted by the NLRA and is unenforceable.Sandoval County Right to Work Ordinance(1/18/18), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2018-03.\n\nCooperation with cities and federal government.— A county and a city can enter into an agreement to cooperate in sponsoring a flood control project, and counties and cities can cooperate with the federal government and seek aid under the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act (16 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.). 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-82.\n\nPower to carry out proprietary functions.— Under the general rule, the grant to counties of the authority to carry out normally proprietary functions may not be implied under any statute. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-103.\n\nOperation of housing project.— The county commissioners are invested with broad powers regarding authority to do acts in the interest of the county. The operation of a housing project is certainly in the interest of the county and for a county purpose and county commissioners have the power to maintain and operate a housing project. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5725.\n\nAuthority over sewage facilities.— Pursuant to this section and 3-26-1A(1) NMSA 1978, counties have the authority to acquire and maintain sewage facilities and thereby meet the requirements of 40 C.F.R. 131.11(o)(2)(ii), which requires an agency to have the authority to effectively manage waste treatment works, etc. 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-15.\n\nCounty may not impose criminal sanctions by resolutionrather than by ordinance. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-26.\n\nFireworks.— This section gives counties the same authority to enact ordinances under the Fireworks Licensing and Safety Act (60-2C-1 et seq. NMSA 1978) as is specifically conferred on municipalities. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-11.\n\nSetting office hours.— A county commission may set the hours that offices of other elected county officials must stay open. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-05.\n\nIncreasing work hours without additional compensation.— A county commission may increase the hours worked by county employees without additional compensation. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-05.\n\nViolation of law by county officials.— Elected county officials who fail to perform their official duty are subject to removal, civil suit or criminal prosecution if they violate the law. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-18.\n\nGeneral superintending authority of commission or council.— A county commission or a county council does not have any general superintending authority over other elected county officials. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-18.\n\nSupervision of employees of elected officials.— A county commission, its personnel director or other agents may exercise supervision over the employees of other elected officials and require those employees to work hours contrary to those established by the officials, to the extent permitted by statute, provided the board's supervision over elected officials' employees does not interfere with the duties of those officials. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-05.\n\nAlthough a county commission has the authority to control staff of elected officials to some extent through the budget, it must act reasonably in light of other demands on the budget and the needs of the officials. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-05.\n\nLease of equipment or personal property.— Municipalities or counties may lease equipment or other personal property on a long-term basis, since municipalities and counties in New Mexico have been given express authority to contract, and a lease is merely a contract. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-20.\n\nPurchase and sale of land for industrial park development.— Under this section, it appears that a county may purchase land for industrial park development and in turn sell the property in order for the development to be realized if such a transaction would be for the benefit of the inhabitants of the county. It appears that so long as the land purchased for industrial park development is sold at a fair market price, the operation of such a project will not run afoul of N.M. Const., art. IX, § 14. 1965 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-75.\n\nConservation easements.— Counties may acquire and hold conservation easements assuming they do so consistent with other laws applicable to public purchases of real property and do not do so by eminent domain. 2001 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 01-02.\n\nProviding work for charitable institutions.— It may be implied, from construction of N.M. Const., art. IX, § 14, that a county would have the power to do road work for a charitable institution which was providing for the care of sick and indigent persons. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-103.\n\nProviding services for private persons.— The county road departments may not perform services for private persons without specific statutory authority. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-103.\n\nResponsibility for legal fees.— In a lawsuit between a county commission and other elected county officials concerning employment terms and conditions, each party is responsible for its own attorney's fees. The county is responsible for legal fees of its elected officials and employees only to the extent required by statute. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-05.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"County Regulation of Land Use and Development,\" see 9 Nat. Resources J. 266 (1969).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 56 Am.

Penalties for violations of any county ordinances shall not exceed a fine of three hundred dollars ($300) or imprisonment for ninety days or both the fine and imprisonment; except that a county may enact and enforce ordinances that impose the following penalties in addition to any other penalty provided by law:\n\n(1) no more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) for discarding or disposing of refuse, litter or garbage on public or private property in any manner other than by disposing it in an authorized landfill;\n\n(2) no more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for the improper or illegal disposal of hazardous materials or waste in any manner other than as provided for in the Hazardous Waste Act [Chapter 74, Article 4 NMSA 1978]; and\n\n(3) no more than imprisonment for three hundred sixty-four days or a fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both, for violation of an ordinance regarding driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs.\n\nB.
