To construe those sections as allowing the county commissioners to use the funds authorized in former section for the purpose of supporting and maintaining a hospital owned by the county but leased to a private organization would have been in direct violation of N.M. Const., art. IV, § 31 and art. IX, § 14 and thus have made the sections unconstitutional. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen.

The county could, however, use any proceeds in the indigent hospital claims fund to provide medical care for indigent patients at the Miners' Hospital if they otherwise qualify. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen.
