Williams, 1952-NMSC-074, 56 N.M. 560, 246 P.2d 1046.\n\nContents of petition.— Petition to board of county commissioners to call an election to vote on proposition to remove county seat was held sufficient without requesting removal of county seat.Gray v. Taylor, 227 U.S. 51, 33 S. Ct. 199, 57 L. Ed. 413 (1913).\n\nDetermination of original cost of old building.— In determining original cost of old building, subsequent repairs should not be included.Gray v. Taylor, 1910-NMSC-069, 15 N.M. 742, 113 P. 588 (1910),aff'd on rehearing, 1911-NMSC-020, 16 N.M. 171, 113 P. 588,aff'd, 227 U.S. 51, 33 S. Ct. 199, 57 L. Ed. 413 (1913).\n\nAm.
