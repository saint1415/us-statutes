The compiler has inserted the bracketed words to complete the sense of the description.\n\nThe original south boundary of San Juan county was amended by Laws 1901, ch. 39 [4-17-1 NMSA 1978] and was fixed as being the fifth standard parallel north.\n\nThis section was incorporated as article 17, chapter 24 of the 1915 Code. It was not reenacted by its inclusion therein, but was compiled merely for convenience.Seethe 1915 Code, p. 1665.\n\nCross references.— For boundaries of Bernalillo county,see4-1-1 and 4-1-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor boundaries of McKinley county,see4-17-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor boundaries of Rio Arriba county,see4-21-1 and 4-21-2 NMSA 1978.",
