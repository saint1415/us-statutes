      "text": "That there be and is hereby created a county, to be known as and called the county of Sandoval, out of that portion of the territory of New Mexico included within the following boundaries, to wit:\n\nbeginning at a point three miles north of the southwest corner of township twenty-three north, of range seven west of the New Mexico principal meridian, according to the public land surveys of the United States, and running thence east along the line three miles north of the line between townships twenty-two and twenty-three north to the said principal meridian, which line shall form a part of the southern boundary of Rio Arriba county; thence south along said principal meridian to the fifth standard parallel north; thence east along said fifth standard parallel north to the range line between ranges six and seven east at the northwest corner of township twenty north in range seven east; thence south along said range line between ranges six and seven east; the same being the western boundary of Santa Fe county, to the southeast corner of township twelve north in range six east of said principal meridian; thence west along the township line between townships eleven and twelve north, said line being the northern boundary of Bernalillo county, to the boundary line of Valencia county at the northwestern corner of Bernalillo county; thence in a northwesterly direction along the boundary line of Valencia county to the third standard parallel north; thence west along said third standard parallel north, to the southeastern corner of McKinley county; thence north and along the eastern boundary line of McKinley county to the fifth standard parallel north at the southwest [northwest] corner of township twenty-one [twenty] north in range four west; thence west along said fifth standard parallel north to the southeast corner of San Juan county at the southwest corner of township twenty-one north in range seven west, and thence north along the range line between ranges seven and eight west, said line being the easterly boundary of San Juan county, to the place of beginning.\n\nHistory:Laws 1905, ch. 10, § 2; Code 1915, § 1104; C.S. 1929, § 33-2101; 1941 Comp., § 15-2101; 1953 Comp., § 15-23-1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCompiler's notes.— A change was made in the boundaries of Sandoval county by the creation of Los Alamos county by Laws 1949, ch. 134, compiled as 4-15-1 and 4-15-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nDue to an east-west correction on the fifth standard parallel north, the west line of the county intersects said standard parallel at the northwest corner of township 20 north of range 4 west rather than at the southwest corner of township 21 north of range 4 west. This correction has been indicated by the compiler by means of the bracketed words.\n\nSandoval county was originally created out of a portion of Bernalillo county. The boundaries of the original Sandoval county, as they appeared in Laws 1903, ch. 27, § 1, were as follows: \"A county is created and established in the territory of New Mexico, to be known as the county of Sandoval, which shall include all that portion of the present county of Bernalillo lying north of a line beginning at the southeast corner of township 12 north, range 6 east of the New Mexico principal meridian, and running thence due west on the township line between townships 11 and 12 north, to the boundary line between the present county of Bernalillo and the county of Valencia.\" The original Sandoval county was abolished by Laws 1905, ch. 10, § 1.\n\nThe sections of this article were incorporated in Article 16, Chapter 24 of the 1915 Code. They were not reenacted by their inclusion therein, but were compiled merely for convenience.Seethe 1915 Code, p. 1665.\n\nCross references.— For boundaries of Bernalillo county,see4-1-1 and 4-1-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor boundaries of Los Alamos county,see4-15-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor boundaries of McKinley county,see4-17-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor boundaries of Rio Arriba county,see4-21-1 and 4-21-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor boundaries of San Juan county,see4-24-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor boundaries of Santa Fe county,see4-26-1 and 4-26-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor original boundaries of Valencia county,see4-32-1 NMSA 1978.",
