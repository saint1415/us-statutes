      "text": "Except as provided in the Uniform Commercial Code [Chapter 55 NMSA 1978], accounts duly verified by the oath of the party claiming the same, or his agent, and promissory notes and other instruments in writing, not barred by law, are sufficient evidence in any suit to enable the plaintiff to recover judgment for the amount thereof, unless the defendant or his agent denies the same under oath.\n\nHistory:Laws 1880, ch. 5, § 18; C.L. 1884, § 1878; C.L. 1897, § 2931; Code 1915, § 2176; C.S. 1929, § 45-603; 1941 Comp., § 20-207; 1953 Comp., § 20-2-7; Laws 1961, ch. 96, § 11-103.\n\nCross references.— For admissibility of evidence in civil actions in district courts,seeRule 11-101 NMRA et seq.\n\nSection held unconstitutional.— Because this section prescribes an evidentiary rule of practice or procedure, an area constitutionally within the power of the supreme court and not the legislature, this section is unconstitutional.Miller & Assocs., Ltd. v.

      "heading": "[Consideration imported by written contract.]",
      "text": "Every contract in writing hereafter made shall import a consideration in the same manner and as fully as sealed instruments have heretofore done.\n\nHistory:Laws 1901, ch. 62, § 12; Code 1915, § 2181; C.S. 1929, § 45-608; 1941 Comp., § 20-208; 1953 Comp., § 20-2-8.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nUnder this section, it is not necessary, in a suit upon a written contract, to allege a consideration.Flores v. Baca, 1919-NMSC-053, 25 N.M. 424, 184 P. 532.\n\nExpress allegation of mortgagor's ownership.— In foreclosure complaint, an express allegation of mortgagor's ownership of mortgaged premises was unnecessary; it was implied.Franklin v. Harper, 1926-NMSC-059, 32 N.M. 108, 252 P. 170;Flores v. Baca, 1919-NMSC-053, 25 N.M. 424, 184 P. 532.\n\nOption agreement.— Where option agreement was alleged to be in writing it was sufficient to withstand the attack of a motion to dismiss for failure to allege consideration.Rubenstein v. Weil, 1965-NMSC-137, 75 N.M. 562, 408 P.2d 140.\n\nContract which is not entirely in writing is regarded as an oral or verbal contract,and a complaint in a suit upon such a contract, which fails to allege a consideration, is fatally defective.Flores v. Baca, 1919-NMSC-053, 25 N.M. 424, 184 P. 532.\n\nUnder this section, a draft imports a consideration.First Nat'l Bank v. Home Ins. Co., 1911-NMSC-010, 16 N.M. 66, 113 P. 815.\n\n\"Import a consideration\" construed.— The language \"import a consideration,\" as used in this section, means that in the absence of evidence on the point, it will be presumed that there was a sufficient consideration and the burden of proof on the question is on the party denying the existence of consideration.Burt v. Horn, 1982-NMCA-037, 97 N.M. 515, 641 P.2d 546.\n\nA deed, being merely a specialized form of contract, consideration is importedin the same manner and as fully as sealed instruments.Rael v. Cisneros, 1971-NMSC-073, 82 N.M. 705, 487 P.2d 133.\n\nAdjustment of disputes is sufficient consideration.— If disputes have arisen under a contract, and the parties thereto enter into a new contract as a means of adjusting such disputes, such adjustment of disputes is a sufficient consideration.Burt v. Horn, 1982-NMCA-037, 97 N.M. 515, 641 P.2d 546.\n\nInstrument bearing evidence of lack of consideration destroys presumption.— Where the instrument upon its face bears the evidence of its infirmity and lack of consideration, it without more furnishes the proof which destroys the presumption of consideration.Burt v. Horn, 1982-NMCA-037, 97 N.M. 515, 641 P.2d 546.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts § 121; 68 Am. Jur. 2d Seals § 11.\n\n17 C.J.S. Contracts §§ 15, 72.",
