      "text": "A. The supreme court of New Mexico shall, by rules promulgated by it from time to time, regulate pleading, practice and procedure in judicial proceedings in all courts of New Mexico for the purpose of simplifying and promoting the speedy determination of litigation upon its merits. Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify the substantive rights of any litigant.\n\nB. The supreme court shall cause all rules to be printed and distributed to all members of the bar of the state and to all applicants, and no rule shall become effective until thirty days after it has been so printed and distributed.\n\nHistory:Laws 1933, ch. 84, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 19-301; 1953 Comp., § 21-3-1; Laws 1966, ch. 28, § 31.\n\nAbrogation of common law jurisdiction to correct illegal sentences.— Paragraph A of Rule 5-801 NMRA, which abrogated the common law jurisdiction of the district court to correct illegal sentences, does not violate the separation of powers doctrine.State v. Torres, 2012-NMCA-026, 272 P.3d 689,overruled by State v. Romero, 2023-NMSC-008.\n\nConstitutionality.— When the legislature enacted this chapter, it did not delegate to the court a function exclusively legislative, contrary to N.M. const., art. III, § 1. The trial court rules promulgated by the supreme court, though promulgated subsequent to and consequent upon the enactment of this chapter, were promulgated, nevertheless, by the court in the exercise of an inherent power lodged in the court to prescribe such rules of practice, pleading, and procedure as will facilitate the administration of justice.State v. Roy, 1936-NMSC-048, 40 N.M. 397, 60 P.2d 646.\n\nUnquestioned power rests in supreme court to promulgate rulesof pleading, practice and procedure.State v. Arnold, 1947-NMSC-043, 51 N.M. 311, 183 P.2d 845.\n\nUnquestioned power rests in supreme court to promulgate rules.— Although 38-1-2 NMSA 1978 refers to statutes existing in 1933, it is fair to attribute to the legislature, in view of the delegation in this section, the intent that statutes relating to pleading, practice and procedure enacted after 1933 would remain in effect \"unless and until modified or suspended by rules\" promulgated pursuant to this section.Lovelace Med. Ctr. v. Mendez, 1991-NMSC-002, 111 N.M. 336, 805 P.2d 603.\n\nPurpose of rules.— This section provides for promulgation by the supreme court of rules to regulate pleading, practice and procedure for the purpose, among others, of \"promoting the speedy determination of litigation upon its merits.\" This indicates the end to be sought by the rules to be no different from that of the federal rules.Fort v. Neal, 1968-NMSC-149, 79 N.M. 479, 444 P.2d 990.\n\nSection prohibits the promulgation of a rule that abridges, enlarges or modifies the substantive rightsof any litigant.Johnson v. Terry, 1944-NMSC-035, 48 N.M. 253, 149 P.2d 795.\n\nModification of legislative rules.— Legislative rules relating to pleading, practice and procedure in the courts, particularly where those rules relate to court management or housekeeping functions, may be modified by a subsequent rule promulgated by the supreme court.Lovelace Med. Ctr. v. Mendez, 1991-NMSC-002, 111 N.M. 336, 805 P.2d 603.\n\nSubstantive law is the positive law which creates, defines and regulates the rights and duties of the partiesand which may give rise to a cause for action, as distinguished from adjective law which pertains to and prescribes the practice and procedure or the legal machinery by which the substantive law is determined or made effective.Honaker v. Ralph Pool's Albuquerque Auto Sales, Inc., 1964-NMSC-142, 74 N.M. 458, 394 P.2d 978.\n\nCreation of the right of appeal is a matter of substantive lawand not within the rule-making power of the supreme court.State v. Arnold, 1947-NMSC-043, 51 N.M. 311, 183 P.2d 845.\n\nRegulation of manner and time for taking appeal procedural matter.— It is within the rule-making power of the supreme court to reduce the time for taking an appeal from six to three months (now 30 days) once the legislature has authorized appeal, since the regulation of the manner and time for taking appeal are procedural matters.State v. Arnold, 1947-NMSC-043, 51 N.M. 311, 183 P.2d 845.\n\nRules liberally construed.— In order that causes coming on for appeal may be reviewed on the merits, supreme court rules are to be construed liberally with that end in view.Fairchild v. United Serv. Corp., 1948-NMSC-048, 52 N.M. 289, 197 P.2d 875.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Survey of New Mexico Law, 1982-83: Civil Procedure,\" see 14 N.M.L.

      "heading": "[Common law is rule of practice and decision.]",
      "text": "In all the courts in this state the common law as recognized in the United States of America, shall be the rule of practice and decision.\n\nHistory:Laws 1875-1876, ch. 2, § 2; C.L. 1884, § 1823; C.L. 1897, § 2871; Code 1915, § 1354; C.S. 1929, § 34-101; 1941 Comp., § 19-303; 1953 Comp., § 21-3-3.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For applicability of common law in criminal cases,see30-1-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nThe legislature intended to adopt the common law,or lex non scripta, and such British statutes of a general nature not local to that kingdom, nor in conflict with the constitution or laws of the United States, nor of this territory, which are applicable to our conditions and circumstances, and which were in force at the time of the American separation from the mother country.Yeo v. Tweedy, 1929-NMSC-033, 34 N.M. 611, 286 P. 970;Browning v. Estate of Browning, 1886-NMSC-022, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 659, 9 P. 677;Territory ex rel. Wade v. Ashenfelter, 1887-NMSC-013, 4 N.M. (Gild.) 93, 12 P. 879, appeal dismissed, 154 U.S. 493, 14 S. Ct. 1141, 38 L. Ed. 1079 (1893);Bent v. Thompson, 1890-NMSC-005, 5 N.M. 408, 23 P. 234,aff'd, 138 U.S. 114, 11 S. Ct. 238, 34 L. Ed. 902 (1891);Gurule v. Duran, 1915-NMSC-043, 20 N.M. 348, 149 P. 302, 1915F L.R.A. 648 (1915);Plomteaux v. Solano, 1918-NMSC-104, 25 N.M. 24, 176 P. 77;Blake v. Hoover Motor Co., 1923-NMSC-005, 28 N.M. 371, 212 P. 738.\n\nNew Mexico adopted the common law or lex non scripta and such British statutes of a general nature not local to that kingdom nor in conflict with the state constitution or specific contrary statutes, which are applicable to conditions and circumstances which were in force at the time of American separation from England, and made it binding as the rule of practice and decision in the courts of this state.Boddy v. Boddy, 1966-NMSC-242, 77 N.M. 149, 420 P.2d 3016).\n\nNew Mexico has adopted the common law.State v. Valdez, 1972-NMCA-014, 83 N.M. 632, 495 P.2d 1079,aff'd, 1972-NMSC-029, 83 N.M. 720, 497 P.2d 231, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 741, 497 P.2d 743; and cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1077, 93 S. Ct. 694, 34 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1972).\n\nBy the adoption of the common law in New Mexico, the civil law was completely supplanted,except as incorporated in the statutes of the territory.Field v. Otero, 1930-NMSC-060, 35 N.M. 68, 290 P. 1015;Beals v. Ares, 1919-NMSC-067, 25 N.M. 459, 185 P. 780.\n\nCommon law as the rule of practice and decision prevails where there is no special statutory provisionin respect to a matter.Walker v. N.M. & S.Pac. R.R., 1893-NMSC-027, 7 N.M. 282, 34 P. 43,aff'd, 165 U.S. 593, 17 S. Ct. 421, 41 L. Ed. 837 (1897).\n\nThe common law is the rule of practice and decision. This rule does not obtain, however, when the subject matter of any procedural right is fully covered by statute or rule.Sellman v. Haddock, 1957-NMSC-037, 62 N.M. 391, 310 P.2d 1045,overruled on other grounds bySafeco Ins. Co. v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 1984-NMSC-045, 101 N.M. 148, 679 P.2d 616.\n\nWhere common law applicable to conditions in state.— The New Mexico supreme court has the power to do away with common-law principles since the common law is not the rule of practice and decision if inapplicable to conditions in New Mexico, and if it is not applicable to the condition and circumstances it is not to be given effect.Hicks v. State, 1975-NMSC-056, 88 N.M. 588, 544 P.2d 1153.\n\nThe common law is not the rule of practice and decision if not applicable to conditions inNew Mexico. Rodgers v. Ferguson, 1976-NMCA-098, 89 N.M. 688, 556 P.2d 844, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619.\n\nCommon law is only abrogated or repealed by statute when directly and irreconcilably opposedto the common law.S. Union Gas Co. v. City of Artesia, 1970-NMSC-086, 81 N.M. 654, 472 P.2d 368.\n\nCommon law inapplicable to procedural right otherwise covered.— The common law does not apply when the subject matter of any procedural right is fully covered by the constitution, statutes or rules.State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. First Judicial Dist. Court, 1981-NMSC-053, 96 N.M. 254, 629 P.2d 330.\n\nCommon-law doctrines not invulnerable.— Because a common-law doctrine is judicially created, it is within the court's province to change a common-law doctrine if it is unwise. Merely because a common-law doctrine has been in effect for many years, it is not rendered invulnerable to judicial attack once it has reached a point of obsolescence.Lopez v. Maez, 1982-NMSC-103, 98 N.M. 625, 651 P.2d 1269.\n\nRevision of an outmoded common law doctrine is within the competence of the judiciary.Lopez v. Maez, 1982-NMSC-103, 98 N.M. 625, 651 P.2d 1269.\n\nII. PARTICULAR MATTERS.\n\nStatute of frauds.— Letters from decedent to his surviving brother contained all elements of a written memoranda of an oral agreement by the decedent to devise the family farm to the surviving brother to satisfy the statute of frauds where the letters identified the parties to the agreement, because they were written by the decedent to the surviving brother; the letters sufficiently identified the property, because they described the property as \"our property in Rio Arriba County\", there was no other property that the brothers owned jointly except the family farm in Rio Arriba County, and the family had a long history and was intimately familiar with the property; and the letters stated the terms and condition of all the promises constituting the agreement and by whom and to whom the promises were made because the letters stated that the surviving brother would convey title to the property to the decedent to allow the decedent to take advantage of the veteran's tax exemption and stated that the decedent would devise the property to the surviving brother if the surviving brother survived the decedent.Varoz v. Varoz, 2008-NMSC-027, 144 N.M. 7, 183 P.3d 151.\n\nWhere sellers verbally agreed to sell a tract of land to buyers for a home site; in reliance on the agreement, buyers cashed IRA and 401-K retirement plans at a substantial penalty; with the consent of the sellers, buyers went into possession of the land, purchased a double-wide mobile home and moved the home onto the land, erected valuable temporary and permanent improvements on the land, and landscaped the property; and buyers spent approximately $85,000 in purchasing the home and making improvements, the buyers' actions were sufficient part performance in reliance on the oral agreement to take the contract outside the statute of frauds.Beaver v. Brumlow, 2010-NMCA-033, 148 N.M. 172, 231 P.3d 628.\n\nChange of venue by court upon own motion.— A trial court, in a proper case and in the exercise of its discretion, has the power to order a change of venue sua sponte. This power existed at common law and the common law is the rule of practice and decision in New Mexico.Valdez v. State, 1972-NMSC-029, 83 N.M. 720, 497 P.2d 231,aff'g,83 N.M. 741, 497 P.2d 743 (1972), cert. denied, 83 N.M. 741, 497 P.2d 743; and cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1077, 93 S. Ct. 694, 34 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1972).\n\nCitizen's arrest.— Because in New Mexico there is no statute covering citizen's arrest, the common law controls; thus, a citizen's arrest may be made for felonies or the misdemeanors of breach of the peace or shoplifting; the person making the arrest must inform the arrested person of the offense for which he was under arrest, and the force used must be reasonable.Downs v. Garay, 1987-NMCA-108, 106 N.M. 321, 742 P.2d 533.\n\nDamages for waste.— An ancient statute giving a landlord treble damages for waste committed by the tenant is a harsh rule and not in harmony with our conditions and circumstances.Blake v. Hoover Motor Co., 1923-NMSC-005, 28 N.M. 371, 212 P. 738.\n\nDower and curtesy.— Common-law rights of dower and curtesy have never obtained in New Mexico as to the interests of the wife and husband, respectively, in the community estate.Hernandez v. Becker, 54 F.2d 542 (10th Cir. 1931).\n\nDoctrine of destructibility of contingent remainders is not applicable in this state.Abo Petroleum Corp. v. Amstutz, 1979-NMSC-070, 93 N.M. 332, 600 P.2d 278.\n\nMarriage.— This section did not introduce the common-law marriage into New Mexico.In re Gabaldon's Estate, 1934-NMSC-053, 38 N.M. 392, 34 P.2d 672.\n\nProbate.— This section did not affect statute laws in relation to probate courts.Bent v. Thompson, 1890-NMSC-005, 5 N.M. 408, 23 P. 234,aff'd, 138 U.S. 114, 11 S. Ct. 238, 34 L. Ed. 902 (1891).\n\nQuo warranto.— In the absence of a statute to try the title to an office in a private corporation, the right to a writ of quo warranto will be left to common-law principles and the interpretation of the statute of 9th Anne, ch. 20.State ex rel. Nw. Colonization & Imp. Co. v. Huller, 1918-NMSC-001, 23 N.M. 306, 168 P. 528, cert. denied, 246 U.S. 667, 38 S. Ct. 336, 62 L. Ed. 929 (1918), appeal dismissed, 247 U.S. 503, 38 S. Ct. 426, 62 L. Ed. 1239 (1918).\n\nRight to hold public office.— There being no statute either denying or conferring the right of holding office upon a woman, the common law adopted hereby will prevail, and under it a woman could hold a purely ministerial office if she were capable of performing the duties thereof.State v. De Armijo, 1914-NMSC-021, 18 N.M. 646, 140 P. 1123;see nowN.M. Const., art. VII, § 2.\n\nStatute of frauds.— The English statute of frauds [29 Car. II, c. 3 (1677)] is in force in New Mexico by virtue of the adoption of the common law of England. Maljamar Oil & Gas Corp. v. Malco Refineries, Inc., 155 F.2d 673 (10th Cir. 1946).\n\nThe English statute of frauds is in force in New Mexico as part of the common law.Coseboom v. Margaret S. Marshall's Trust, 1958-NMSC-065, 64 N.M. 170, 326 P.2d 368,rev'd on other grounds, 1960-NMSC-113, 67 N.M. 405, 356 P.2d 117.\n\nThe English statute of frauds is part of our common law.Alvarez v. Alvarez, 1963-NMSC-124, 72 N.M. 336, 383 P.2d 581;Ades v. Supreme Lodge Order of Ahepa, 1947-NMSC-031, 51 N.M. 164, 181 P.2d 161;Pitek v. McGuire, 1947-NMSC-053, 51 N.M. 364, 184 P.2d 647;Pederson v. Lothman, 1958-NMSC-003, 63 N.M. 364, 320 P.2d 378;Ray v. Jones, 1958-NMSC-080, 64 N.M. 223, 327 P.2d 301;Boswell v. Rio De Oro Uranium Mines, Inc., 1961-NMSC-082, 68 N.M. 457, 362 P.2d 991.\n\nThe statute of frauds is part of the common law.Boddy v. Boddy, 1966-NMSC-242, (1966).\n\nSurvival of actions.— The rule in common law that no cause of action for personal injury resulting in death survived in favor of the personal representative of the deceased, nor against the personal representative of the wrongdoer, remains the rule of practice and decision in New Mexico, except as superseded or abrogated by statute or constitution, or held to be inapplicable to conditions in New Mexico.Ickes v. Brimhall, 1938-NMSC-036, 42 N.M. 412, 79 P.2d 942 (see nowSections 41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978).\n\nThe common law rule that a claim for personal injury not resulting in death does not survive the death of the victim is not applicable to conditions in New Mexico because the tort of negligence did not exist when the rule developed and because there is no reason for such a rule in connection with compensatory damages.Rodgers v. Ferguson, 1976-NMCA-098, 89 N.M. 688, 556 P.2d 844, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619.\n\nWater law.— New Mexico has never followed the common law in connection with its waters, but, on the contrary, have followed the Mexican or civil law, and what is called the Colorado doctrine of prior appropriation and beneficial use,Martinez v. Cook, 1952-NMSC-034, 56 N.M. 343, 244 P.2d 134,aff'd, 1953-NMSC-043, 57 N.M. 263, 258 P.2d 375;see also1939 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 39-3152.\n\nPrivileges in rules of evidence.— Rule 11-501 is very different from Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence which states that privileges are \"governed by the privileges or the common law.\" The fact that New Mexico did not follow the approach of congress but instead limited the privileges available to those recognized by the constitution, the rules of evidence, or other rules of the supreme court manifests the abrogation and inapplicability of the common law evidentiary privileges.State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. First Judicial Dist. Court, 1981-NMSC-053, 96 N.M. 254, 629 P.2d 330 (decided on basis of prior federal rules, now Cf. Fed. Rule 501).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Judicial Adoption of Comparative Fault in New Mexico: The Time Is at Hand,\" see 10 N.M.L.

OBO, Inc., 2010-NMCA-061, 148 N.M. 483, 238 P.3d 357.\n\nJudgment granting equitable relief in action based on express contract.— Where plaintiff, who was the operating-interest owner, redeveloped an oilfield unit and sought reimbursement from defendant, who was a working-interest owner; plaintiff unilaterally redeveloped the unit without obtaining the consent of defendant as was required by the operating agreement of the parties; the redevelopment project increased oil and gas production, enhanced the unit, and netted favorable revenue consequences for defendant; although the district court concluded that plaintiff had breached the operating agreement, the court granted judgment for plaintiff based on unjust enrichment; plaintiff's action was for breach of contract and to enforce a contractual lien; plaintiff never asserted a claim for unjust enrichment, the case was not tried on the theory of unjust enrichment, and plaintiff did not request findings of fact and conclusions of law on unjust enrichment; and the court never mentioned the existence of any evidence or entered any findings of fact that supported its conclusion of unjust enrichment or otherwise provided any basis for invoking the unjust enrichment theory in the face of the parties' express contract, the court was not permitted to exercise its equitable powers to grant plaintiff relief under the equitable unjust enrichment theory of recovery.Arena Res., Inc. v.

The court in any action, suit or proceeding, in which service is made in the manner provided in Subsections [Subsection] B or C of Section 2 [38-1-8 NMSA 1978] may, in its discretion, order such postponement as may be necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to comply with the provisions of Subsection A of this section and to defend such action.\n\nC.

Filing a notice of lis pendens is not limited to those cases in which the adverse party claims a beneficial interest in the title to the property.High Mesa Gen. P'ship v. Patterson, 2010-NMCA-072, 148 N.M. 863, 242 P.3d 430, cert. quashed, 2011-NMCERT-002, 150 N.M. 617, 264 P.3d 129.\n\nParty filing lis pendens must have a present claim to the property.— To be eligible to record a lis pendens notice on a piece of real property, the party recording the notice must assert a present claim to the property's title or have some other present interest in the property.United States v. Jarvis, 499 F.3d 1196 (10th Cir. 2007).\n\nSubdivision affects title to property.— The subdivision of property and the approval of a subdivision plat affect the title to the property being subdivided.High Mesa Gen. P'ship v. Patterson, 2010-NMCA-072, 148 N.M. 863, 242 P.3d 430, cert. quashed, 2011-NMCERT-002, 150 N.M. 617, 264 P.3d 129.\n\nNotice of lis pendens filed by a party who did not have an interest in the property.— Where the county approved plaintiff's application for a preliminary subdivision plat of plaintiff's property; defendant filed an administrative appeal of the county's decision pursuant to Rule 1-074 NMRA and a notice of lis pendens; and defendant had no interest in the property, the notice of lis pendens was properly filed, and defendant did not have an obligation to obtain a stay under Rule 1-074 NMRA prior to filing the notice of lis pendens.High Mesa Gen. P'ship v. Patterson, 2010-NMCA-072, 148 N.M. 863, 242 P.3d 430, cert. quashed, 2011-NMCERT-002, 150 N.M. 617, 264 P.3d 129.\n\nEffect of voluntary release of notice of lis pendens.— Where a party chooses not to exercise the right to give notice to subsequent purchasers through a notice of lis pendens, either by not recording a notice during litigation or by releasing the notice prior to the conclusion of the litigation, further purchasers are deemed to be without constructive notice of the pending claims involving the property.Kokoricha v. Estate of Donald I. Keiner, 2010-NMCA-053, 148 N.M. 322, 236 P.3d 41.\n\nEffect of voluntary release of notice of lis pendens.— Where plaintiffs purchased property that was the subject of ongoing probate litigation in which the decedent's estate sought to set aside a deed from the decedent to the decedent's nephew; the estate did not file a notice of lis pendens when the litigation was commenced; after two years of litigation, the estate filed a notice of lis pendens; prior to the conclusion of the litigation, the estate voluntarily released the lis pendens; and plaintiffs purchased the property after the lis pendens had been released, but prior to the conclusion of the litigation, there was no active notice on record providing plaintiffs with constructive notice of the pending probate litigation involving title to the property.Kokoricha v. Estate of Donald I. Keiner, 2010-NMCA-053, 148 N.M. 322, 236 P.3d 41.\n\nRights relate to date of filing notice.— If judgment is in favor of the one filing the lis pendens notice, the rights of that party relate back to the date of the notice.Title Guar. & Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 1987-NMCA-107, 106 N.M. 272, 742 P.2d 8.\n\nDuration of lis pendens.— A lis pendens continues until expiration of the time to appeal or until final disposition of the case by the appellate court.Salas v. Bolagh, 1987-NMCA-138, 106 N.M. 613, 747 P.2d 259.\n\nWhere purchaser of real estate withheld his deed from registration and recordation until after suitwas filed to cancel the conveyance to his vendor for fraud and notice of lis pendens is filed, the purchaser was a subsequent purchaser and charged with notice of the fact that his grantor's title was attacked in the suit.Wilson v. Robinson, 1916-NMSC-010, 21 N.M. 422, 155 P. 732.\n\nVendor's implied lien was properly held paramount to the mortgage lien of an intervenerwhere vendor had filed (now recorded) notice of lis pendens in county clerk's office in July, 1942, without actual knowledge of the intervener's claim to an equitable lien dating back to Jan., 1942, intervener's mortgage not having been executed until Oct., 1942, and filed for record in Dec., 1942.Logan v. Emro Chem. Corp., 1944-NMSC-044, 48 N.M. 368, 151 P.2d 329.\n\nNotice held ineffective.— Contractor filed suit to enforce lien on apparatus, equipment and plants of mining company and to recover balance due under contract. On same day that suit was filed, he endeavored to file (now record) a notice of the pendency of such suit under this section. About ten months later, on the mining company being adjudicated bankrupt, the contractor's claim was allowed against the estate of the bankrupt mining company, but his lien was denied on the ground that since his suit in the state court did not affect title to real estate, the lis pendens was not properly filed (now recorded) and did not constitute constructive notice to trustee in bankruptcy of the alleged lien.Sweeney v. Medler, 78 F.2d 148 (10th Cir. 1935).\n\nFiling in anticipation of money judgment is prohibited.— The filing of a notice of lis pendens in anticipation of a money judgment is prohibited.Hill v. Department of Air Force, 884 F.2d 1321 (10th Cir. 1989).\n\nFiling of lis pendens cannot support slander of title action.— The filing of a lis pendens is absolutely privileged and cannot support an action for slander of title.Superior Constr., Inc. v. Linnerooth, 1986-NMSC-008, 103 N.M. 716, 712 P.2d 1378.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part II,\" see 2 Nat. Resources J. 75 (1962).\n\nAm.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nEngaging in non-jurisdictional discovery was not a waiver of the jurisdictional defense.— Where defendant was a New York corporation that owned and operated a hotel in Texas pursuant to a franchise agreement with a franchisor which owned the hotel's brand; plaintiff, who was a guest at defendant's hotel in Texas, was injured while using equipment in the hotel's exercise facility; plaintiff sued defendant in New Mexico for personal injuries; and defendant filed an answer together with a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and sent plaintiff interrogatories, a request for production of documents, and requested authorizations to obtain records relating to plaintiff, defendant did not waive its jurisdictional defense by engaging in non-jurisdictional discovery.Trei v. AMTX Hotel Corp., 2014-NMCA-104.\n\nUnauthorized credit reports.— Personal jurisdiction can be found to exist in a forum where a non-resident defendant obtains credit reports without the permission of the resident plaintiff.Smith v. Cutler, 504 F. Supp. 2d 1162 (D.N.M. 2007).\n\nConstitutionality of section generally.— This section does not violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States.Melfi v. Goodman, 1962-NMSC-020, 69 N.M. 488, 368 P.2d 582.\n\nSeparation of powers.— This section is not an unconstitutional invasion of the judicial branch in violation of the separation of powers provision of the constitution.Gray v. Armijo, 1962-NMSC-082, 70 N.M. 245, 372 P.2d 821;see alsoClews v. Stiles, 303 F.2d 290 (10th Cir. 1960).\n\nRetroactive application.— In adopting this section, the New Mexico legislature adopted the construction of the Illinois courts that the section has retroactive effect.Clews v. Stiles, 303 F.2d 290 (10th Cir. 1960).\n\nSection is procedural in nature, and retrospective application does not affect substantial rights in violation of the constitution.Gray v. Armijo, 1962-NMSC-082, 70 N.M. 245, 372 P.2d 821.\n\nConstruction of section.— This section is a statute in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed.Worland v. Worland, 1976-NMSC-027, 89 N.M. 291, 551 P.2d 981.\n\nBecause this section was adopted from the Illinois statutes, it is presumed that the New Mexico legislature also adopted the prior construction of the statute by the highest courts of Illinois, and while this presumption is not conclusive, it is persuasive.Melfi v. Goodman, 1962-NMSC-020, 69 N.M. 488, 368 P.2d 582.\n\nNew Mexico's long-arm statute was taken from Illinois, and the interpretations by the Illinois courts of the Illinois statute are persuasive.Telephonic, Inc. v. Rosenblum, 1975-NMSC-067, 88 N.M. 532, 543 P.2d 825.\n\nJurisdictional test.— In order to satisfy the requirements of this section, and invest the courts of New Mexico with jurisdiction, the act complained of must meet a three-prong test: (1) defendant must do one of the acts enumerated in Subsection A; (2) plaintiff's cause of action must arise from the specified act; and (3) defendant must have minimum contacts sufficient to satisfy due process.Visarraga v. Gates Rubber Co., 1986-NMCA-021, 104 N.M. 143, 717 P.2d 596, cert. quashedsub nom. Vissarraga v. Littlejohn's Equip. Co., Inc., 104 N.M. 137, 717 P.2d 590 (1986);Sanchez v. Church of Scientology, 1993-NMSC-034, 115 N.M. 660, 857 P.2d 771.\n\nSection establishes two requirements for the assertion of jurisdiction over a nonresident not within the state. First, the defendant must have done one of the acts enumerated in the section; and second, the plaintiff's cause of action must arise from defendant's doing the act.Winward v. Holly Creek Mills, Inc., 1972-NMSC-009, 83 N.M. 469, 493 P.2d 954;Benally v. Hundred Arrows Press, Inc., 614 F. Supp. 969 (D.N.M. 1985),rev'd on other groundssub nom. Benally v. Amon Carter Museum of W. Art, 858 F.2d 618 (10th Cir. 1988).\n\nIn personam jurisdiction in New Mexico over nonresident defendants has three elements: the court must first determine whether the defendant has committed one of the acts enumerated in this section as a basis for exercising extra-territorial jurisdiction. If the court so finds, it must then determine whether the cause of action arises from the acts enumerated. The court must then analyze whether the defendant has had \"minimum contacts\" with the state of New Mexico sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the due process clause of the United States constitution.Beh v. Ostergard, 657 F. Supp. 173 (D.N.M. 1987).\n\nSpecific jurisdiction based on stream of commerce theory.— A manufacturer of an allegedly defective component part that has placed the component part into a distribution channel with the expectation that it will be sold in the national market cannot be insulated from liability simply because the manufacturer does not specifically target or know that its products are being marketed in New Mexico.Sproul v. Rob & Charlie's Inc., 2013-NMCA-072.\n\nWhere plaintiff was thrown off a bicycle because the front wheel, which had a quick-release mechanism that was manufactured by appellee, separated from the bicycle's front fork assembly; appellee had its principal place of business in China and Taiwan and its manufacturing facilities were located in China; appellee sold its products internationally to bicycle manufacturers, had no distributors or clients in New Mexico, and did not know where the bicycles that incorporated its quick-release mechanism were sold; appellee had a full-time marketing and sales employee in California who sold appellee's products and provided customer services and support to appellee's clients in the United States; appellee did business with six bicycle manufacturers in the United States, including the third-party defendant who was a nation-wide distributor of bicycle parts located in Florida and who served the New Mexico market; plaintiff purchased the bicycle from defendant who was a retailer located in New Mexico, appellee had sufficient minimum contacts with New Mexico through appellee's distribution system to subject it to personal jurisdiction in New Mexico.Sproul v. Rob & Charlie's Inc., 2013-NMCA-072.\n\nBurden of proof of jurisdictional allegations.— Generally, where jurisdiction is based on process served under this section, the plaintiff has the burden to prove the jurisdictional allegations at the hearing on defendant's motion to dismiss, but where defendant challenges all but one ground of alleged jurisdiction, the trial court did not err in failing to put the plaintiff to its jurisdictional proof in advance of trial.Plumbers Specialty Supply Co. v. Enter. Prod. Co., 1981-NMCA-083, 96 N.M. 517, 632 P.2d 752.\n\nBurden of proof.— The least quantity of contacts possible in a given case upholds the maintenance of an action in the state forum. When such contacts are established, the burden shifts to the nonresident defendant to present facts that will convince the forum court that it would offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.Moore v. Graves, 1982-NMCA-170, 99 N.M. 129, 654 P.2d 582.\n\nA plaintiff must show that a defendant did an act included in the long-arm statute.Sublett v. Wallin, 2004-NMCA-089, 136 N.M. 102, 94 P.3d 845.\n\nIn order to determine personal jurisdiction based on a website, an approach that, at a minimum, requires a degree of interactivity on the site is adopted.Sublett v. Wallin, 2004-NMCA-089, 136 N.M. 102, 94 P.3d 845.\n\nPhysical presence of defendant within state not required.— Personal jurisdiction over a nonresident does not depend upon the physical presence of the defendant within the state.Moore v. Graves, 1982-NMCA-170, 99 N.M. 129, 654 P.2d 582.\n\nCase by case determinations.— In order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam, if he not be present within the territory of the forum, he must have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,\" and what determines whether the defendant has sufficient contact to satisfy this test must be decided case by case.Hunter-Hayes Elevator Co. v. Petroleum Club Inn Co., 1966-NMSC-218, 77 N.M. 92, 419 P.2d 465.\n\nMere mailings not enough contact.— Ordinarily, use of the mails, telephone, or other international communications simply does not qualify as purposeful activity invoking the benefits and protection of the forum state.Sanchez v. Church of Scientology, 1993-NMSC-034, 115 N.M. 660, 857 P.2d 771.\n\nNonresident guarantying note insufficient for in personam jurisdiction.— Signing of a guaranty by a nonresident of a debt owed to a New Mexico creditor does not in and of itself constitute a sufficient contact upon which to base in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident. Rather, the circumstances surrounding the signing of such obligations must be closely examined in each case to determine whether the quality and nature of defendant's contacts with New Mexico justify the assertion of personal jurisdiction over him in an action on the obligation.FDIC v. Hiatt, 1994-NMSC-044, 117 N.M. 461, 872 P.2d 879.\n\nNo personal jurisdiction over defendants who send bills to residents.— New Mexico lacks personal jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants who send statements for payment of medical services rendered, which statements are received by plaintiffs in New Mexico.Tarango v. Pastrana, 1980-NMCA-110, 94 N.M. 727, 616 P.2d 440.\n\nNo personal jurisdiction over doctors where plaintiff claims out-of-state treatment.— New Mexico lacks personal jurisdiction over defendant doctors who have never conducted activities within New Mexico, where the basis of plaintiff's claim is her unilateral activity (medical treatment) in defendants' state of residence.Tarango v. Pastrana, 1980-NMCA-110, 94 N.M. 727, 616 P.2d 440.\n\nMailing of collection letters sufficient for jurisdiction.— District court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over California debt collection agency which sent one or more collection letters to a New Mexico resident when the cause of action was based upon that contact.Russey v. Rankin, 837 F. Supp. 1103 (D.N.M. 1993).\n\nAssertion of lien insufficient.— Giving notice by mail and assertion of an attorney's charging lien by a nonresident attorney upon the proceeds of a settlement obtained by a New Mexico lawyer did not subject the nonresident to personal jurisdiction of a New Mexico court under the long-arm statute.Robinson-Vargo v. Funyak, 1997-NMCA-095, 123 N.M. 822, 945 P.2d 1040.\n\nAllegations of conspiracy not sufficient.— Mere allegations of conspiracy, without some sort of prima facie factual showing of a conspiracy, cannot be the basis of personal jurisdiction of co-conspirators outside the territorial limits of the court.Sanchez v. Church of Scientology, 1993-NMSC-034, 115 N.M. 660, 857 P.2d 771.\n\nNo jurisdiction based on actions subsequent to claim.— As a general rule, the existence of personal jurisdiction may not be established by events which have occurred after the acts which gave rise to the plaintiff's claims.Doe v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Boise, Inc., 1996-NMCA-057, 121 N.M. 738, 918 P.2d 17, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 693, 917 P.2d 962.\n\nFacts showed sufficient minimum contacts conferring in personam jurisdiction.Barker v. Barker, 1980-NMSC-024, 94 N.M. 162, 608 P.2d 138.\n\nPersonal jurisdiction to award attorney's fees, costs and travel costs cannot be based on this section.Worland v. Worland, 1976-NMSC-027, 89 N.M. 291, 551 P.2d 981.\n\nQuestion whether claims arise from activities subjecting defendant to jurisdiction of state must be decided on case-by-case basis.Winward v. Holly Creek Mills, Inc., 1972-NMSC-009, 83 N.M. 469, 493 P.2d 954.\n\nCause of action held to arise from acts subjecting defendant to jurisdiction of state.— Where cause of action is based on sale of a majority stock ownership in a New Mexico corporation, in violation of an agreement made in New Mexico with a citizen of New Mexico, this would satisfy the requirements of this section.Pope v. Lydick Roofing Co., 1970-NMSC-090, 81 N.M. 661, 472 P.2d 375.\n\nManner of service of process.— Although substituted service is not explicitly provided for in this section, the legislature's purpose in adopting the statute was to permit service of process on out-of-state persons in the same manner as process may be served upon residents of the state. The procedure for service of process in New Mexico, outlined in the rules of civil procedure, applies to actions which are brought under this section.Vann Tool Co. v. Grace, 1977-NMSC-054, 90 N.M. 544, 566 P.2d 93.\n\nSubstituted service was insufficient to grant jurisdiction where defendants testified that they no longer lived at the residence where service was posted, and where there was no return of service indicating that the questioned address was defendants' \"usual place of abode\" to rebut that testimony.Vann Tool Co. v. Grace, 1977-NMSC-054, 90 N.M. 544, 566 P.2d 93.\n\nService of process on New Mexico driver by serving a copy of the summons, complaint and court order upon the driver by an Arizona sheriff was valid under this section.Crawford v. Refiners Coop. Ass'n, 1962-NMSC-131, 71 N.M. 1, 375 P.2d 212.\n\nPreemption by federal law.— District court jurisdiction in ex-wife's case seeking declaration of her interest in husband's military retirement pay could not be predicated on this section since it was preempted by federal law.Sparks v. Caldwell, 1986-NMSC-053, 104 N.M. 475, 723 P.2d 244.\n\nII. TRANSACTIONS OF BUSINESS.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nPassive website.— A passive website, which merely provides information and offers no opportunity for interaction, will ordinarily not be enough to support personal jurisdiction.Sublett v. Wallin, 2004-NMCA-089, 136 N.M. 102, 94 P.3d 845.\n\nLong-arm jurisdiction more than technical \"transaction\" or \"commission\".— The question of personal jurisdiction over out-of-state residents involves more than a technical \"transaction of any business\" or the technical \"commission of a tortious act\" within New Mexico: the meaning of those terms, in this section, is to be equated with the minimum contacts sufficient to satisfy due process.Tarango v. Pastrana, 1980-NMCA-110, 94 N.M. 727, 616 P.2d 440.\n\n\"Transaction of business\" requires certain minimal contracts by the defendant or his agent within the forum.Hunter-Hayes Elevator Co. v. Petroleum Club Inn Co., 1966-NMSC-218, 77 N.M. 92, 419 P.2d 465.\n\nTo subject a defendant to in personam jurisdiction if he is not within the state, there must be certain \"minimum contacts\" with the state, so that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.Winward v. Holly Creek Mills, Inc., 1972-NMSC-009, 83 N.M. 469, 493 P.2d 954.\n\nTest to meet federal due process in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam when he is not present in the forum is that defendant must have certain minimum contacts with forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\"McIntosh v. Navaro Seed Co., 1970-NMSC-040, 81 N.M. 302, 466 P.2d 868.\n\nThis section relates to the \"minimum contacts\" with New Mexico which are required to constitute the transaction of business within this state, and it is the transaction of such business within the state which makes the exercise of in personam jurisdiction under this section consistent with \"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\" and secures unto the defendant his constitutional right to due process.Telephonic, Inc. v. Rosenblum, 1975-NMSC-067, 88 N.M. 532, 543 P.2d 825.\n\nInsofar as the acquisition of long-arm jurisdiction under this section is concerned, the \"transaction of business\" is equated with the due process standard of \"minimum contacts\" sufficient to satisfy the \"traditional conception of fair play and substantial justice\" announced inInternational Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95 (1945).Telephonic, Inc. v. Rosenblum, 1975-NMSC-067, 88 N.M. 532, 543 P.2d 825.\n\nDoing or transacting business is doing a series of similar actsfor the purpose of thereby realizing pecuniary benefit, or otherwise accomplishing an object, or doing a single act for such purpose with the intention of thereby initiating a series of such acts.Telephonic, Inc. v. Rosenblum, 1975-NMSC-067, 88 N.M. 532, 543 P.2d 825;Plumbers Specialty Supply Co. v. Enter. Prod. Co., 1981-NMCA-083, 96 N.M. 517, 632 P.2d 752.\n\nSingle act as minimum contact.— This section refers to \"any transaction of business\" and a single transaction negotiated, or to be performed, within the forum can be sufficient contact.McIntosh v. Navaro Seed Co., 1970-NMSC-040, 81 N.M. 302, 466 P.2d 868.\n\nWhether or not party did transact business within the contemplation of this section must be determined by the factsin each case.Telephonic, Inc. v. Rosenblum, 1975-NMSC-067, 88 N.M. 532, 543 P.2d 825.\n\nFactors determining \"transaction of any business\".— Various factors are relevant in determining whether a nonresident defendant transacted any business within the state, including, the voluntariness of the defendant's contact with the state, the nature of the transaction, the applicability of New Mexico law, the contemplation of the parties, and the location of likely witnesses.Kathrein v. Parkview Meadows, Inc., 1984-NMSC-117, 102 N.M. 75, 691 P.2d 462.\n\nNeither defendant's placement of an advertisement in a nationally distributed trade magazine nor its delivery of allegedly counterfeit jewelry to plaintiff's New Mexico office was sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction, as these acts did not indicate that defendant had purposefully availed itself of the benefits and protections of New Mexico law.Sunwest Silver, Inc. v. Int'l Connection, Inc., 4 F. Supp. 2d 1284 (D.N.M. 1998).\n\nFranchising agreement insufficient.— While entering into a franchise agreement with a New Mexico resident requiring payment of royalties outside the state may be the \"transaction of any business\" contemplated by this section, that fact alone is insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction; claims must arise from that transaction of business.Campos Enters., Inc. v. Edwin K. Williams & Co., 1998-NMCA-131, 125 N.M. 691, 964 P.2d 855, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 107, 967 P.2d 447.\n\nPresence of subsidiary not enough for jurisdiction over foreign corporation.— A foreign corporation is not subject to the jurisdiction of a forum state merely because its subsidiary is present or doing business there, where subsidiary was separately controlled and could not be considered the alter ego or agent of the foreign corporation.Allen v. Toshiba Corp., 599 F. Supp. 381 (D.N.M. 1984).\n\nThe defendant properly and adequately challenged the prima facie jurisdictional allegations by submitting an affidavit that established the separateness of the corporate entities between the church and the New Mexico subsidiary, the lack of an employee or agency relationship between the church and the subsidiary, and the denial of a conspiracy. Therefore, the plaintiffs had the burden of proving the jurisdictional allegations, and the record does not reveal proof of the jurisdictional allegations contained in the complaint.Sanchez v. Church of Scientology, 1993-NMSC-034, 115 N.M. 660, 857 P.2d 771.\n\nThe mere existence of a parent-subsidiary corporate relationship is generally not sufficient to warrant jurisdiction over the foreign parent. However, acts of the subsidiaries may be used to predicate jurisdiction in two situations: first, if the parent's control of the subsidiary goes beyond that normally exercised by a majority shareholder, and is so complete as to render the subsidiary an instrumentality of the parent, the subsidiary may be the alter ego of the parent and thus a court may pierce the corporate veil; or second, if the subsidiary does an act at the direction of the parent, or in the course of the parent's business, a court may characterize the subsidiary as an agent of the parent and thereby hold the parent answerable as a principal.Jemez Agency, Inc. v. CIGNA Corp., 866 F. Supp. 1340 (D.N.M. 1994).\n\nSuccessor liability.— The plaintiffs have not shown sufficient minimum contacts to satisfy the defendant parent corporation's right to due process. Not only was the successor subsidiary dissolved prior to the cause of action arising, but also the predecessor company in effect was sold, in conjunction with the dissolution, to another company. Thus, since the defendant corporation had no reason to anticipate defending a lawsuit more than three years later in New Mexico and had no significant opportunity either to improve the product or benefit from past sales, the policies behind successor liability are outweighed by the corporate law policies against imposition of liability.Smith v. Halliburton Co., 1994-NMCA-055, 118 N.M. 179, 879 P.2d 1198.\n\nOut-of-state advertiser establishes \"minimum contact\".— A nonresident defendant who solicits business for his benefit by advertising in a trade magazine in the forum state as a result of which he sells his merchandise to be used in the forum state establishes a \"minimum contact.\"Moore v. Graves, 1982-NMCA-170, 99 N.M. 129, 654 P.2d 582.\n\nPlace of execution of contract factor in making determination.— The place of execution of the contract, although a circumstance to be considered in determining whether or not a person is transacting business in this state within the contemplation of this section, is not a controlling, an essential or even a highly significant fact in making this determination.Telephonic, Inc. v. Rosenblum, 1975-NMSC-067, 88 N.M. 532, 543 P.2d 825.\n\nSolicitation of orders factor in making determination.— The statutory language of 53-17-1 NMSA 1978, dealing with the solicitation of orders as not constituting transaction of business within New Mexico, is for \"purposes of the Business Corporation Act,\" and not for testing jurisdiction under this section.Winward v. Holly Creek Mills, Inc., 1972-NMSC-009, 83 N.M. 469, 493 P.2d 954.\n\nCause of action held to arise from acts subjecting defendant to jurisdiction of state.— Any dispute arising out of payment to the agent for services in representing the defendant's business transactions in New Mexico would be within the wake of defendant's commercial activity. Plaintiff's claim, therefore, was one arising from the transaction of business within New Mexico.Winward v. Holly Creek Mills, Inc., 1972-NMSC-009, 83 N.M. 469, 493 P.2d 954.\n\nB. PARENT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY RELATIONSHIP.\n\nAlter ego issues.— New Mexico's test for alter ego is a matter of substantive corporate law. Where the parent corporation did not simply own its subsidiary; but it completely controlled it to the point where the subsidiary existed as little more than an instrument to serve the parent corporation's real estate interests, there are sufficient minimum contacts. The true test for any assertion of personal jurisdiction is minimum contacts. New Mexico case law does not set a higher standard when the out-of-state defendant is a corporation.Alto Eldorado P'ship v. Amrep Corp., 2005-NMCA-131, 138 N.M. 607, 124 P.3d 585.\n\nC. ACTS CONSTITUTING TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS.\n\nActs held to constitute transaction of business.— Where the defendant, which was a foreign corporation that had never qualified to do business in New Mexico, assumed the operation of an oil and gas well in New Mexico, employed personnel in New Mexico for the purpose of operating an oil and gas lease, held itself out as the operator of the oil and gas well, failed to pay net proceeds to other parties to the oil and gas lease, ignored the demands of the other parties for an accounting, and failed to market production and protect against drainage with respect to the oil and gas well, the defendant had the minimum contacts with New Mexico to confer jurisdiction over the defendant.Capco Acquisub, Inc. v. Greka Energy Corp., 2008-NMCA-153, 145 N.M. 328, 198 P.3d 354, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-010, 145 N.M. 524, 201 P.3d 855.\n\nActs held to constitute transaction of business.— Where defendant agreed in New Mexico to sell a judgment against a New Mexico corporation, received the initial payment in state and was assigned a mortgage to secure the deferred payments, he transacted business within the meaning of this section.Melfi v. Goodman, 1962-NMSC-020, 69 N.M. 488, 368 P.2d 582.\n\nWhere nonresident defendants transacted business in New Mexico by executing promissory notes secured by a mortgage deed executed in Oklahoma, which created a lien upon land located in New Mexico, the proceeds from which notes were to be used for the construction of a building in New Mexico, and defendants were physically present in New Mexico from time to time in negotiating these notes, the defendants were subject to the jurisdiction of New Mexico courts, although served with process outside the state of New Mexico, in accordance with this section as the facts were sufficient contacts with New Mexico to constitute the transaction of business therein.Hunter-Hayes Elevator Co. v. Petroleum Club Inn Co., 1966-NMSC-218, 77 N.M. 92, 419 P.2d 465.\n\nThe regular distribution plan of nonresident magazine publisher with the commercial benefit to the nonresident defendant which he derived from the sale of magazines was sufficient contact to satisfy the requirements of due process and subject the defendants to the jurisdiction of New Mexico courts.Blount v. TD Pub. Corp., 1966-NMSC-262, 77 N.M. 384, 423 P.2d 421.\n\nWhere Texas corporation's agent contacted plaintiff by telephone about buying grain and then came into New Mexico and took grain samples and returned them to Texas for testing, sent a truck into New Mexico for a load of the grain, and the agent who had negotiated the deal for the Texas corporation operated one of the trucks in returning the grain from New Mexico to the corporation's place of business in Texas, Texas corporation was subject to personal jurisdiction of New Mexico courts.McIntosh v. Navaro Seed Co., 1970-NMSC-040, 81 N.M. 302, 466 P.2d 868.\n\nThe actions of defendant in having plaintiff solicit orders, make delivery to purchasers, advertise its products through plaintiff and pay plaintiff wages and commissions within the state of New Mexico constituted the transaction of business within the meaning of this section.Winward v. Holly Creek Mills, Inc., 1972-NMSC-009, 83 N.M. 469, 493 P.2d 954.\n\nWhere evidence shows that California corporate manufacturer solicited a New Mexico corporate dealer's business and carried on an ongoing business relationship with that dealer by supplying goods bearing dealer's private label on a regular basis, the \"doing business\" ground for jurisdiction of New Mexico courts over the manufacturer is met.Plumbers Specialty Supply Co. v. Enter. Prod. Co., 1981-NMCA-083, 96 N.M. 517, 632 P.2d 752.\n\nA nonresident alcoholism treatment center's general solicitation of referrals and advertising in phone directory in New Mexico and its invitation to New Mexican plaintiff to attend center's \"Family Week\" where plaintiff's husband was attending treatment program as a result of an earlier solicitation in New Mexico were sufficient to constitute \"transaction of any business\" for New Mexican courts to exercise jurisdiction over defendant in personal injury action against defendant resulting from plaintiff's visit to defendant's facilities.Kathrein v. Parkview Meadows, Inc., 1984-NMSC-117, 102 N.M. 75, 691 P.2d 462.\n\nTexas museum's activities in New Mexico - soliciting the devise of a photography collection, negotiating the terms of the collection's maintenance and exhibition, traveling to New Mexico to take possession of the collection, and invoking the benefits of New Mexico's laws of testamentary disposition manifested a purposeful intent to conduct business in New Mexico.Benally v. Amon Carter Museum of W. Art, 858 F.2d 618 (10th Cir. 1988).\n\nInsureds' purchase of an insurance policy in New Mexico constituted a transaction of business in New Mexico, for purposes of a declaratory judgment action to determine uninsured motorist coverage.State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. v. Conyers, 1989-NMSC-071, 109 N.M. 243, 784 P.2d 986.\n\nHospital transacted business in New Mexico when it placed advertisements in several New Mexico telephone directories, produced television commercials that could be, and were, viewed by New Mexico customers, and previously performed health care services for other New Mexico customers.Cronin v. Sierra Med. Ctr., 2000-NMCA-082, 129 N.M. 521, 10 P.3d 845, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 519, 10 P.3d 843, cert. denied, 532 U.S. 921, 121 S. Ct. 1357, 149 L. Ed. 2d 287 (2001).\n\nDefendants were subject to specific personal jurisdiction because they availed themselves of the protections and benefits of New Mexico law under a stream of commerce theory.— Where plaintiffs, family members and the personal representative of the estate of a New Mexico resident killed in a single-vehicle rollover accident allegedly caused by tire tread separation on a Bridgestone tire installed on the decedent's vehicle, brought a wrongful death action against defendants, alleging that design and manufacturing defects caused the tread of the tire to peel off suddenly and that defendants negligently failed to notify tire shops in New Mexico, such as the one that installed the tire in this case, that they should remove this type of tire from service if it is more than ten years old, the district court did not err in denying defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of specific personal jurisdiction, because a state may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant if that defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws, and the record in this case reflected that defendants established numerous purposeful contacts in New Mexico to do business in the state, such as operating a copyrighted, interactive website in New Mexico to solicit business and establish channels of communication with New Mexico residents, directing users to the nearest Bridgestone retailer among fifty-four New Mexico dealer locations, offering consumers coupons and discounts to be used at Bridgestone dealers in New Mexico, allowing New Mexico consumers to register their tires with Bridgestone, recruiting for employment opportunities in New Mexico, providing warranty and safety information to New Mexico residents, engaging in marketing that advertises nationally as well as directly to New Mexico residents, inviting consumers to call them toll-free and follow them on social media platforms, and receiving and processing tire orders from New Mexico residents. Defendants' purposeful availment of the privilege of doing business in New Mexico satisfies the minimum contacts threshold requirement to be subject to specific personal jurisdiction.Chavez v. Bridgestone, 2023-NMCA-022.\n\nD. ACTS NOT CONSTITUTING TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS.\n\nMinimum contacts.— An ad in a New Mexico newspaper, which solicits applicants for nursing jobs in a hospital in Lubbock, Texas, stating that the defendant offers \"comprehensive health care services to our patients in West Texas and Eastern New Mexico, does not constitute the type of \"purposeful availment\" of the benefits and protections of New Mexico's law that would satisfy the minimum contacts required by due process.Pelton v. Methodist Hosp., 989 F. Supp. 1392 (D.N.M. 1997).\n\nMortgage and note.— Where defendant, a Texas corporation, acquired a promissory note that was secured by a lien on New Mexico property and mortgages on property in Arizona, California and New York, defendant acquired the note in Missouri and did not participate in the negotiation for or execution of the note in New Mexico, the New Mexico long-arm statute did not confer personal jurisdiction over defendant in the plaintiff's action to contest whether defendant could foreclose on the New York mortgage. The court found that defendant did not purposefully decide to participate in the economy of New Mexico and to avail itself of the benefits of New Mexico law in acquiring and foreclosing on the New York mortgage. Defendant did not establish minimum contacts with New Mexico such that it could reasonably anticipate being hauled into New Mexico court, and the court could not exercise personal jurisdiction over defendant on the basis of the New York mortgage.Rogers v. 5-Star Mgmt., Inc., 946 F. Supp. 907 (D.N.M. 1996).\n\nLien.— Where defendant has not attempted to foreclose a New Mexico lien, nor has it attempted to participate in the management of the New Mexico real property, or ever met with plaintiffs in New Mexico regarding the New Mexico lien, there is no close relationship between the claimed transaction of business in New Mexico and the cause of action.Rogers v. 5-Star Mgmt., Inc., 946 F. Supp. 907 (D.N.M. 1996).\n\nNo continuous and systematic contacts.— A Texas hospital did not have the requisite minimum contacts with New Mexico to satisfy due process where the Texas hospital generated seven percent of its income from treatment of New Mexico patients; the Texas hospital and a New Mexico hospital entered into an agreement related to the transfer of patients between the hospitals; the Texas hospital maintained a website that was accessible in New Mexico; the Texas hospital was registered as a Medicaid provider in New Mexico; the Texas hospital was an accredited regional trauma center for a part of New Mexico; and the Texas hospital was located in the border region with a part of New Mexico.Zavala v. El Paso Cnty. Hosp. Dist., 2007-NMCA-149, 143 N.M. 36, 172 P.3d 173.\n\nContacts insufficient to support general personal jurisdiction.— In a medical malpractice action, where Texas surgeon performed surgeries on plaintiffs, New Mexico residents, in Texas and in a Texas hospital, evidence that the surgeon maintained a passive website that did not specifically target New Mexicans, possessed an inactive medical license, owned real property in New Mexico, and authored a book that was available in New Mexico, was insufficient to demonstrate that the nonresident surgeon had continuous and systematic contact with New Mexico to support general personal jurisdiction.Gallegos v. Frezza, 2015-NMCA-101.\n\nEvidence insufficient to determine whether personal jurisdiction exists.— Where defendant, a Texas surgeon, treated New Mexico residents referred to him by Presbyterian Healthcare (Presbyterian), a New Mexico corporation, for bariatric procedures under an agreement between Presbyterian and a Texas organization established by defendant's employer to handle managed care contracting, the district court erred in finding that the fact that defendant was not a party to the agreement was dispositive of whether defendant had a relationship with Presbyterian sufficient for the state to assert personal jurisdiction over him, when it was unclear to what extent defendant benefited from the agreement, whether the agreement required defendant to accept Presbyterian patients, to what extent defendant himself sought to become credentialed with Presbyterian, and whether and how defendant became the sole provider of bariatric surgery services to Presbyterian members. Remand to the district court was necessary to determine the parameters of the relationship between defendant and Presbyterian and whether such agreement or arrangement was a contact sufficient for general jurisdiction and whether there was a relationship sufficient for specific jurisdiction.Gallegos v. Frezza, 2015-NMCA-101.\n\nNational advertising.— Where defendant was a New York corporation that owned and operated a hotel in Texas pursuant to a franchise agreement with a franchisor which owned the hotel brand; plaintiff, who was a guest at defendant's hotel in Texas, was injured while using equipment in the hotel's exercise facility; plaintiff sued defendant in New Mexico for personal injuries; defendant had no facilities, hotels, offices, employees or agent in New Mexico and did not conduct any business in New Mexico; plaintiff claimed that defendant had sufficient contacts with New Mexico to establish jurisdiction because defendant's franchisor engaged in advertising and marketing activities of the franchisor's brand in New Mexico through national television and radio, the out-of state franchisor's national advertising did not provide a basis to establish personal jurisdiction in New Mexico over defendant.Trei v. AMTX Hotel Corp., 2014-NMCA-104.\n\nNo contacts in New Mexico.— Where the state sued defendant to force defendant to contribute money to the tobacco escrow fund; defendant manufactured tobacco products, was incorporated in and had its principal place of business in Canada, operated exclusively on the Six Nation Indian Reserve in Canada, was not registered to do business in New Mexico, did not have an agent for service of process in New Mexico, and did not directly engage in business activity in New Mexico; in 2005, a retail tobacco store in New Mexico sold 19,540 cigarettes that were manufactured by defendant; the retail store purchased the cigarettes from a wholesale distributor located in Nevada; defendant did not have any contact or contractual arrangement with either the retail store or the wholesale distributor regarding sales of the cigarettes in New Mexico; and the state mailed a copy of the summons and complaint to defendant by certified mail, the district court lacked personal jurisdiction.State ex rel. Att'y Gen. v. Grand River Enters. Six Nations, Ltd., 2014-NMCA-073.\n\nActs held not to constitute transaction of business.— Where the decedent died in a car accident in Utah; plaintiffs contacted an Ohio shipping company to prepare the decedent's body for shipping to New Mexico; the shipping company contacted a Utah funeral home to prepare the decedent's body in Utah for shipping by the shipping company; the Utah funeral home prepared the decedent's body for shipment and billed the shipping company for its services; the Utah funeral home was a Utah limited liability company, licensed only in Utah and did not advertise its services in New Mexico or solicit business in New Mexico; an employee of the Utah funeral home had a telephone conversation with one of decedent's relatives who initiated the telephone call in Utah; after the decedent's body was delivered to New Mexico, an employee of the New Mexico funeral home delivered a bag to plaintiffs containing the decedent's personal effect; the bag contained the decedent's brain; and plaintiff's sued the Utah funeral home for tortious conduct in handling the decedent's body, the Utah funeral home did not have sufficient contacts with New Mexico to satisfy the requirement of due process.M.R. v. Serenicare Funeral Home, L.L.C., 2013-NMCA-022, 296 P.3d 492, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-001.\n\nA resident of California, who allegedly executed an \"authorization to obtain loan\" contract with plaintiff, New Mexico mortgage investment broker, and who had not even been in New Mexico for the past 10 years, did not transact business within New Mexico and thereby submit himself to the jurisdiction of the New Mexico courts under the provisions of this section.Telephonic, Inc. v. Rosenblum, 1975-NMSC-067, 88 N.M. 532, 543 P.2d 825.\n\nIt would be neither fair nor just to subject defendant to a judgment in personam on the basis of three payments owed on a business account which were mailed into this state, as these contacts are not the requisite minimum contacts to satisfy due process requirements.Diamond A Cattle Co. v. Broadbent, 1973-NMSC-004, 84 N.M. 469, 505 P.2d 64.\n\nWhere Ohio auto dealer, doing no business in New Mexico, sold car to Ohio resident who later moved to New Mexico, and dealer assigned the sales contract to a national financing company with a New Mexico division, insufficient minimum contacts existed for New Mexico to exercise personal jurisdiction over Ohio dealer.Swindle v. GMAC, 1984-NMCA-019, 101 N.M. 126, 679 P.2d 268, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 77, 678 P.2d 705.\n\nDefendant's contacts in New Mexico were insufficient to constitute a transaction of business within the state where the only contact made by the defendant, a construction company incorporated in Nevada and awarded a contract to build a large house in Nevada, consisted of its mailing of a purchase order to plaintiff in New Mexico pursuant to a prearranged agreement between the plaintiff and other parties.Customwood Mfg., Inc. v. Downey Constr. Co., 1984-NMSC-115, 102 N.M. 56, 691 P.2d 57.\n\nNonresident parent's support of resident minor children is not transacting business within the meaning of the long-arm statute.Fox v. Fox, 1985-NMCA-070, 103 N.M. 155, 703 P.2d 932.\n\nWhere the research and development by nonresident defendants of radioactive seeds for the treatment of cancer was not in any way connected to the state, the fact that some companies within the state received some financial assistance from the defendants and that information disseminated by the defendants fortuitously found its way into the state could not form the basis for the assertion of personal jurisdiction over the defendants.Jones v. 3M Co., 107 F.R.D. 202 (D.N.M. 1984).\n\nThe record failed to establish that a Colorado petroleum equipment company had sufficient minimum contacts with New Mexico to invest the state with in personam jurisdiction over it, either on the basis of its transaction of business or the commission of a tortious act, where the company was a secondary distributor, had not pursued a policy of purposeful business activity in the state and its contacts were minimal, did not purposefully cause an allegedly defective hose to be shipped into New Mexico, did not engage in a nationwide sales or distribution scheme, maintained no property or agents in the state, did not engage in business in New Mexico, and solicited no business nor made any direct sales in New Mexico.Visarraga v. Gates Rubber Co., 1986-NMCA-021, 104 N.M. 143, 717 P.2d 596, cert. quashed,sub nom. Visarraga v. Littlejohn's Equip. Co., Inc., 104 N.M. 137, 717 P.2d 590.\n\nA Colorado doctor did not purposefully initiate activity in this state, thus invoking the benefits and protections of New Mexico laws, where he did return plaintiff's telephone call concerning plaintiff's daughter to a telephone number in New Mexico, but only after a doctor-patient relationship had been established in Colorado, and after plaintiff had left a message and request with the doctor's answering service. This single telephone call lacked the purposefulness of defendant's contact which is demanded by due process in order to invest a court in New Mexico with personal jurisdiction over the Colorado doctor's clinic.Valley Wide Health Servs., Inc. v. Graham, 1987-NMSC-053, 106 N.M. 71, 738 P.2d 1316.\n\nIt would offend fair play and substantial justice to subject an out-of-state nonresident defendant to suit in New Mexico where the defendant's only contact with New Mexico was mailing two documents and making a telephone call into the state, and where these contacts arose in the context of an essentially out-of-state transaction.Salas v. Homestake Enters., Inc., 1987-NMSC-094, 106 N.M. 344, 742 P.2d 1049.\n\nConnecticut defendant's use of the mails and telephone in contacting New Mexico plaintiff, in response to plaintiffs' solicitations of business in Connecticut, and in subsequently purchasing a computer system from plaintiffs, were not sufficient \"minimum contacts\" to constitute the required jurisdictional nexus.Wesley v. H & D Wireless Ltd. P'ship, 678 F. Supp. 1540 (D.N.M. 1987).\n\nCalifornia and British banks were not subject to personal jurisdiction in an action involving letters of credit, since the banks were not authorized to transact business in the state and did not commit acts in the state in any way related to the letters of credit.Martin v. First Interstate Bank, 914 F. Supp. 473 (D.N.M. 1995).\n\nActs of defendants in retaining a New Mexico attorney to contest plaintiff's appointment as personal representative in New Mexico probate action, following defendants' receipt of estate assets, did not constitute a sufficient basis to find that defendants transacted business in New Mexico.Harrell v. Hayes, 1998-NMCA-122, 125 N.M. 814, 965 P.2d 933.\n\nAn out-of-state company that arranged, essentially by telephone, fax and mail correspondence, to retain software program services from a New Mexico corporation did not transact business in New Mexico within the meaning of this section.Caba Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Mustang Software, Inc., 1999-NMCA-089, 127 N.M. 556, 984 P.2d 803.\n\nPlaintiff failed to carry its burden of establishing that a nonresident purposely availed itself of the benefits and protections of New Mexico law, because, while the nonresident must have recognized selling its products through another company's web page and catalog could result in nationwide, if not worldwide, sales, up to the date of the action it had resulted in no contact with New Mexico other than plaintiff's one purchase over an internet web site.Origins Natural Res., Inc. v. Kotler, 133 F. Supp. 2d 1232 (D.N.M. 2001).\n\nPersonal jurisdiction does not exist over Connecticut diocese that sent priest to New Mexico for pedophilia treatment as the Connecticut diocese neither transacted business there nor committed a tortious act in New Mexico.Tercero v. Roman Catholic Diocese, 2002-NMSC-018, 132 N.M. 312, 48 P.3d 50.\n\nIII. TORTIOUS ACTS.\n\nFranchisor must be connected to franchisee's tortious act.— For this section to be satisfied, plaintiff must establish a relationship, agency or otherwise, between a franchisor and franchisee that connects the franchisor to the alleged tortious act of franchisee; thus, where franchisee was independent contractor, not agent, there was no personal jurisdiction over the franchisor based on the actions of the franchisee.Campos Enters., Inc. v. Edwin K. Williams & Co., 1998-NMCA-131, 125 N.M. 691, 964 P.2d 855, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 107, 967 P.2d 447.\n\nMere mailings not enough contact.— The defendant non-resident law firm was not subject to personal jurisdiction in New Mexico since the law firm's alleged tortious acts were committed through the sending of fraudulent letters and the act of deceitful communications via telephone with the plaintiffs, who were New Mexico residents; the letters and telephone calls were merely ancillary to the primary function of providing legal services to the plaintiffs in the pursuit of rights and claims in California on behalf of the plaintiffs.DeVenzeio v. Rucker, Clarkson & McCashin, 1996-NMCA-064, 121 N.M. 807, 918 P.2d 723, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 783, 918 P.2d 369.\n\n\"Tortious conduct.\"— The acts of defendants in passively receiving distribution of funds or property in Texas, pursuant to the action of decedent's personal representative in New Mexico, were insufficient to establish the commission of a tort in New Mexico.Harrell v. Hayes, 1998-NMCA-122, 125 N.M. 814, 965 P.2d 933.\n\nVoluntary intercourse is not \"tortious act\" for jurisdictional purposes.— Voluntary intercourse between two consenting adults is not a \"tortious act,\" within Subsection A(3), so as to give a court jurisdiction over a nonresident putative father in a paternity action.State ex rel. Garcia v. Dayton, 1985-NMSC-015, 102 N.M. 327, 695 P.2d 477.\n\nAct outside state causing injury within state.— When negligent acts occur outside New Mexico which cause injury within New Mexico, a \"tortious act\" has been committed within this state.Roberts v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 1983-NMCA-110, 100 N.M. 363, 670 P.2d 974).\n\nTort completed in New Mexico.— Where plaintiff and defendants formed a joint venture to bid on a federal contract; plaintiff was a New Mexico corporation and defendants were foreign corporations; some of defendants' employees were paid their salaries by plaintiff and were enrolled in plaintiff's insurance and plans; defendants decided to acquire another New Mexico corporation to replace plaintiff in the business venture; and plaintiff was excluded from the federal contract bid and suffered damages, the district court had personal jurisdiction over defendants in plaintiff's action for tortious interference with a business opportunity because plaintiff suffered economic loss which completed sue tort.Santa Fe Technologies, Inc. v. Argus Networks, Inc., 2002-NMCA-030, 131 N.M. 772, 42 P.3d 1221, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 737, 42 P.3d 842.\n\nSitus of tortious act.— Where, although the negligent implantation of an intrauterine contraceptive device occurred in California, plaintiff developed complications in New Mexico, because a tort is not complete until the injury occurs, the place of injury determines where the tort occurs, and thus, the tortious act was committed in New Mexico, and the patient's negligence and battery causes of action against the physician, and the respondeat superior and negligent supervision claims against his employer, the board of regents of the University of California, arose from the alleged commission of a \"tortious act\" in New Mexico.Beh v. Ostergard, 657 F. Supp. 173 (D.N.M. 1987).\n\nNo jurisdiction for out-of-state injury.— This section could not be used to assert personal jurisdiction over the defendant, a Delaware department store corporation registered and doing business in New Mexico, since the plaintiff's negligence action, for an injury which incurred in Georgia, did not arise from the defendant's transaction of business in New Mexico, nor from its commission of a tortious act within the state.Werner v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 1993-NMCA-112, 116 N.M. 229, 861 P.2d 270.\n\nIV. DOMESTIC RELATIONS.\n\nSubsection A(5) is inapplicable in paternity action against nonresident putative fatherbecause New Mexico does not recognize a common-law marriage.State ex rel. Garcia v. Dayton, 1985-NMSC-015, 102 N.M. 327, 695 P.2d 477.\n\nSection gives jurisdiction to grant a divorce, but does not mention child custody,nor is child custody implied as an incident of divorce.Worland v. Worland, 1976-NMSC-027, 89 N.M. 291, 551 P.2d 981.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment on Melfi v. Goodman, 69 N.M. 488, 368 P.2d 582 (1962), see 3 Nat.
