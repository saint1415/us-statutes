      "heading": "Per diem and mileage for witnesses.",
      "text": "A. Witnesses shall be allowed no fees for services, but shall receive per diem expense and mileage at the rate specified for nonsalaried public officers as provided in the Per Diem and Mileage Act [10-8-1 to 10-8-8 NMSA 1978] for that time in which attendance is required, with certification of the clerk of the court.\n\nB. The district judge in any civil case pending in the district court may order the payment of a reasonable fee, to be taxed as costs, in addition to the per diem and mileage as provided for in Subsection A of this section, for any witness who qualifies as an expert and who testifies in the cause in person or by deposition. The additional compensation shall include a reasonable fee to compensate the witness for the time required in preparation or investigation prior to the giving of the witness's testimony. The expert witness fee which may be allowed by the court shall be limited to one expert regarding liability and one expert regarding damages unless the court finds that additional expert testimony was reasonably necessary to the prevailing party and the expert testimony was not cumulative.\n\nC. The provisions of this section shall apply only to cases filed on or after its effective date.\n\nHistory:Laws 1887, ch. 40, § 1; C.L. 1897, § 1810; Code 1915, § 5898; C.S. 1929, § 155-104; 1941 Comp., § 20-104; 1953 Comp., § 20-1-4; Laws 1959, ch. 62, § 1; 1971, ch. 139, § 1; 1975, ch. 105, § 1; 1983, ch. 189, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The reference to the effective date in Subsection C means the effective date of Laws 1983, Chapter 189, which was June 17, 1983.\n\nCross references.— For limitation on taxation of costs,see39-2-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor fees for witnesses in workers' compensation cases,see52-5-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nExpert costs.— An expert was forced to wait for the production of the documents, which he needed to prepare for the testimony that he later gave. Any costs that were incurred as a result of the delay are recoverable under Section 38-6-4B NMSA 1978.H-B-S P'ship v. Aircoa Hospitality Services, Inc., 2008-NMCA-013, 143 N.M. 404, 176 P.3d 1136.\n\nWhere expert testimony was reasonably necessary, as part of the mix of information the district court needed, it should be recompensed.Primetime Hospitality, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 2009-NMSC-011, 146 N.M. 1, 206 P.3d 112.\n\nExpert witness fees in summary judgment.— Where defendants obtained summary judgment in a toxic tort action, defendants were entitled to recover expert witness fees for witnesses whose affidavits and testimony were material to the award of summary judgment for defendants and to the exclusion of the testimony of plaintiff's expert witnesses and whose testimony was not cumulative.Andrews v. United States Steel Corp., 2011-NMCA-032, 149 N.M. 461, 250 P.3d 887.\n\nExpert witnesses' fees are treated as costs and are taxed upon entry of judgment to the prevailing party,not at the time a complaint is filed.Mantz v. Follingstad, 1972-NMCA-164, 84 N.M. 473, 505 P.2d 68,overruled on other grounds byPeralta v. Martinez, 1977-NMCA-040, 90 N.M. 391, 564 P.2d 194.\n\nSeparate finding of reasonable necessity for multiple witnesses.— The court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the fees of two expert witnesses as costs. A separate finding of \"reasonable necessity\" was not required, since it could be inferred that this section was considered by the court.Ulibarri v. Gee, 1987-NMSC-113, 106 N.M. 637, 748 P.2d 10.\n\nExpert's expenses allowed as costs.— Expense of a survey made preparatory for trial, and upon which the surveyor testified, is properly allowed as costs.Ulibarri Landscaping Material, Inc. v. Colony Materials, Inc., 1981-NMCA-148, 97 N.M. 266, 639 P.2d 75, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nAllowance of an expert witness fee was reasonable based on testimony that, in addition to the time the witness spent preparing for and testifying at trial, he spent additional time analyzing and investigating reports prepared by other party's expert witness.Key v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 1999-NMCA-028, 127 N.M. 38, 976 P.2d 523,aff'd in part, 2000-NMSC-010, 128 N.M. 739, 998 P.2d 575.\n\nAward of costs for fees of expert witnesses who do not testifyin person or in a deposition is not authorized by New Mexico statute.Fernandez v. Espanola Pub. Sch. Dist., 2004-NMCA-068, 135 N.M. 677, 92 P.3d 689,aff'd, 2005-NMSC-026, 138 N.M. 283, 119 P.3d 163.\n\nBecause none of the plaintiffs' expert witnesses had testified in the cause either in person or in a deposition prior to the time that plaintiffs had accepted defendants' offer of judgment, the court lacked discretion to award costs under the express language of Subsection B of this section.Fernandez v. Espanola Pub. Sch. Dist., 2004-NMCA-068, 135 N.M. 677, 92 P.3d 689,aff'd, 2005-NMSC-026, 138 N.M. 283, 119 P.3d 163.\n\nPhysicians appearing as expert witnesses.— Fees paid to physicians who testified as expert witnesses at trial or served as consulting experts to plaintiff were properly awarded as costs against defendant.Gillingham v. Reliable Chevrolet, 1998-NMCA-143, 126 N.M. 30, 966 P.2d 197.\n\nCosts allowed in case of fraudulent claim.— In an action to quiet title to property, where a claim was based upon a document expressly found to have been forged by defendant, the trial court's order denying an award of costs for plaintiff's expert witness and imposition of sanctions against defendant was reversed and remanded for reconsideration.Martinez v. Martinez, 1997-NMCA-096, 123 N.M. 816, 945 P.2d 1034.\n\nCase resting on Workers' Compensation Act was not controlling authorityfor a case interpreting Subsection B of this section.Fernandez v. Espanola Pub. Sch. Dist., 2004-NMCA-068, 135 N.M. 677, 92 P.3d 689,aff'd, 2005-NMSC-026, 138 N.M. 283, 119 P.3d 163.\n\nUse of court fund for payment of expert witnesses.— A district court in the administration of justice may use its court fund to pay for expert witnesses regardless or whether or not such an expert is testifying for the prosecution. Further, this section does not set a limitation on this fee. Perhaps, however, the fee set out in this section would furnish a good guideline for the district court to use in setting the fees for that expert which must be paid from the court fund. 1966 Op.

      "text": "A. No husband shall be compelled to disclose any communication made by his wife during the marriage, and no wife shall be compelled to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during the marriage.\n\nB. An attorney cannot, without the consent of his client, be examined as to any communication made by the client to him, or his advice given thereon in the course of professional employment; nor can an attorney's secretary, stenographer or clerk be examined, without the consent of his employer, concerning any fact the knowledge of which has been acquired in such capacity.\n\nC. In the courts of the state, no certified public accountant or public accountant shall be permitted to disclose information obtained in the conduct of any examination, audit or other investigation made in a professional capacity, or which may have been disclosed to said accountant by a client, without the consent in writing of such client or his, her or its successors or legal representatives.\n\nD. If a person offers himself as a witness and voluntarily testifies with reference to the communications specified in this section, that is a consent to the examination of the person to whom the communications were made as above provided.\n\nHistory:Laws 1880, ch. 12, § 7; C.L. 1884, § 2081; C.L. 1897, § 3020; Code 1915, § 2174; C.S. 1929, § 45-512; Laws 1933, ch. 33, § 1; 1939, ch. 235, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 20-112; 1953 Comp., § 20-1-12; Laws 1973, ch. 223, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— It has been stated in Ammerman v. Hubbard Broadcasting, Inc., 89 N.M. 307, 312, 551 P.2d 1354, 1359 (1976), that \"no person has a privilege, except as provided by constitution or rule of . . . court . . ..\"\n\nCross references.— For privileges generally,seeRule 11-501 NMRA.\n\nSpousal privilege.— This statute extends a spousal testimonial privilege to any communication. Rule 11-505 NMRA, however, provides that one spouse may prevent another from disclosing a confidential communication made during the marriage. Thus, the statute is far more comprehensive and seeks to grant a greater privilege than does the rule. The New Mexico supreme court has held that any conflict between the rules of evidence and statutes attempting to create evidentiary privileges must be resolved in favor of the rules. Section 38-6-6A NMSA 1978, which mirrors the older common law rule that neither spouse could be compelled to disclose a communication made during the marriage, does not govern the court's decision.State v. Teel, 1985-NMCA-115, 103 N.M. 684, 712 P.2d 792.\n\nIn suit for alienation of affections, letters written to plaintiff by her husband,showing a deep affection for her, were competent to rebut claim of defendant that no affection existed and there was none to be lost.Murray v. Murray, 1925-NMSC-029, 30 N.M. 557, 240 P. 303.\n\nAttorney-client privilege should only be applied to protect communications - not facts.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Steinkraus, 1966-NMSC-134, 76 N.M. 617, 417 P.2d 431.\n\nAllowance of accountant's testimony held not error.— The privilege in this section is available only to the client and where this privilege was not asserted by objection or otherwise, allowance of the testimony of defendant's accountant was not error.Ash v. H.G. Reiter Co., Inc., 1967-NMSC-149, 78 N.M. 194, 429 P.2d 653.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"New Mexico's Accountant-Client Privilege,\" see 37 N.M.L.

      "heading": "Witnesses with developmental or intellectual disability; competency evaluation.",
      "text": "A. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"witness with a developmental or intellectual disability\" means a witness in a proceeding whom the court has found after hearing, as provided in Subsection B of this section, to have a developmental or intellectual disability; and\n\n(2) \"developmental or intellectual disability\" means a substantial limitation in present functioning characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following applicable skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure and work.\n\nB. In any judicial proceeding wherein a witness with a developmental or intellectual disability may or will testify, the court on its own motion or on motion of the proponent of the witness with a developmental or intellectual disability, and after hearing, may order the use of one of the alternative procedures for determining competency to testify or for taking the testimony of the witness with a developmental or intellectual disability described below, provided that the court finds at the time of the order, by a preponderance of the evidence in the case, that the witness with a developmental or intellectual disability is likely, as a result of submitting to usual procedures for determining competency or as a result of testifying in open court:\n\n(1) to suffer unreasonable and unnecessary mental or emotional harm; or\n\n(2) to suffer a temporary loss of or regression in cognitive or behavioral functioning or communicative abilities such that the witness's ability to testify will be significantly impaired.\n\nC. If the court orders the use of an alternative procedure pursuant to this section, the court shall make and enter specific findings on the record describing the reasons for such order.\n\nD. A court that makes findings in accordance with Subsection B of this section may order any of the following suitable alternative procedures for determining the competency to testify or for taking the testimony of the witness with a developmental or intellectual disability:\n\n(1) taking the testimony of the witness with a developmental or intellectual disability while permitting a person familiar to the witness such as a family member, clinician, counselor, social worker or friend to sit near or next to the witness;\n\n(2) taking the testimony of the witness with a developmental or intellectual disability in court but off the witness stand;\n\n(3) if the proceeding is a bench proceeding, taking the testimony of the witness with a developmental or intellectual disability in a setting familiar to the witness;\n\n(4) if the proceeding is a jury trial, videotaping of testimony, out of the presence of the jury or in a location chosen by the court or by agreement of the parties; or\n\n(5) the procedure set forth in Paragraph (1) in combination with Paragraph (2), (3) or (4) of this subsection.\n\nE. Testimony taken by a videotape pursuant to an order issued as provided in Subsection B of this section shall be taken in the presence of the judge, counsel for all parties and such other persons as the court may allow. Counsel shall be given the opportunity to examine, confront or cross-examine the witness with a developmental or intellectual disability to the same extent as would be permitted if ordinary procedures had been followed, subject to such protection of the witness as the judge deems necessary.\n\nF. An order issued pursuant to provisions of Subsection B of this section that the testimony of the witness with a developmental or intellectual disability be videotaped out of the presence of the jury shall provide that the videotape be shown in court to the jury in the presence of the judge, the parties and the parties' counsel. At such courtroom showing, the audio portion of the video shall be entered into the record as would any oral testimony and shall be treated in all respects as oral testimony to the jury.\n\nG. The videotape or giving of testimony taken by an alternative procedure pursuant to an order issued as provided in Subsection B of this section shall be admissible as substantive evidence to the same extent as and in lieu of live testimony by the witness in any proceeding for which the order is issued or in any related proceeding against the same party when consistent with the interests of justice; provided that such an order is entered or re-entered based on current findings at the time when, or within a reasonable time before, the videotape or testimony is offered into evidence, and provided, in the case of a related criminal proceeding, that the requirements of Subsection E of this section were satisfied when the videotape was recorded or the alternative procedure was used.\n\nH. Whenever, pursuant to an order issued as provided in Subsection B of this section, testimony is recorded on videotape, the court shall ensure that:\n\n(1) the recording equipment is capable of making an accurate recording and is operated by a competent operator;\n\n(2) the recording is in color and is taken in well-lit conditions;\n\n(3) the presence of the presiding judge, the attorneys, the defendant or parties, if in the room, and all other persons present is stated on the recording;\n\n(4) the witness with a developmental or intellectual disability is visible at all times and, to the extent reasonably possible, the recording shows all persons present in the room as a jury would perceive them in open court;\n\n(5) every voice on the recording is audible and identifiable;\n\n(6) the recording is accurate, undistorted in picture or sound quality and has not been altered except as ordered by the court; and\n\n(7) each party is afforded the opportunity to view the recording before it is shown in the courtroom.\n\nI. The fact that the witness with a developmental or intellectual disability has been found in a court proceeding to be incompetent to make informed decisions of a personal, medical or financial nature or is under a guardianship or conservatorship shall not preclude the witness from testifying if found competent to testify and, further, shall not preclude a determination of competency to testify.\n\nJ. The use of alternative procedures shall not be denied because they may take significantly more time than conventional procedures.\n\nK. Expert opinion shall be admissible at any hearing held pursuant to this section, including hearings to determine the competency of a witness with a developmental or intellectual disability to testify.\n\nL. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit the court from using other appropriate means, consistent with this section and other laws and with the defendant's rights, to protect a witness with a developmental or intellectual disability from trauma during a court proceeding.\n\nHistory:Laws 1993, ch. 333, § 1; 2023, ch. 113, § 11.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, updated terms relating to developmental and intellectual disabilities; in the section heading, deleted \"mental retardation\" and added \"developmental or intellectual disability\"; deleted \"mental retardation\" and added \"a developmental or intellectual disability\" throughout the section; and changed \"his\" and \"him\" to \"the witness\".",
