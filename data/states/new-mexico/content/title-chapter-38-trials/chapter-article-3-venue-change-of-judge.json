      "text": "All civil actions commenced in the district courts shall be brought and shall be commenced in counties as follows and not otherwise:\n\nA. First, except as provided in Subsection F of this section relating to foreign corporations, all transitory actions shall be brought in the county where either the plaintiff or defendant, or any one of them in case there is more than one of either, resides; or second, in the county where the contract sued on was made or is to be performed or where the cause of action originated or indebtedness sued on was incurred; or third, in any county in which the defendant or either of them may be found in the judicial district where the defendant resides.\n\nB. When the defendant has rendered himself liable to a civil action by any criminal act, suit may be instituted against the defendant in the county in which the offense was committed or in which the defendant may be found or in the county where the plaintiff resides.\n\nC. When suit is brought for the recovery of personal property other than money, it may be brought as provided in this section or in the county where the property may be found.\n\nD. (1) When lands or any interest in lands are the object of any suit in whole or in part, the suit shall be brought in the county where the land or any portion of the land is situate.\n\n(2) Provided that where such lands are located in more than one county and are contiguous, that suit may be brought as to all of the lands in any county in which a portion of the lands is situate, with the same force and effect as though the suit had been prosecuted in each county in which any of the lands are situate. In all such cases in which suit is prosecuted in one county as to contiguous lands in more than one county, notice of lis pendens shall be filed pursuant to Sections 38-1-14 and 38-1-15 NMSA 1978 in each county. For purposes of service of process pursuant to Rule 4 [Rule 1-004 NMRA] of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts, any such suit involving contiguous lands located in more than one county shall be deemed pending in each county in which any portion of the land is located from the date of filing of the lis pendens notice.\n\nE. Suits for trespass on land shall be brought as provided in Subsection A of this section or in the county where the land or any portion of the land is situate.\n\nF. Suits may be brought against transient persons or non-residents in any county of this state, except that suits against foreign corporations admitted to do business and which designate and maintain a statutory agent in this state upon whom service of process may be had shall only be brought in the county where the plaintiff, or any one of them in case there is more than one, resides or in the county where the contract sued on was made or is to be performed or where the cause of action originated or indebtedness sued on was incurred or in the county where the statutory agent designated by the foreign corporation resides.\n\nG. Suits against any state officers as such shall be brought in the court of the county in which their offices are located, at the capital or in the county where a plaintiff, or any one of them in case there is more than one, resides, except that suits against the officers or employees of a state educational institution as defined in Article 12, Section 11 of the constitution of New Mexico, as such, shall be brought in the district court of the county in which the principal office of the state educational institution is located or the district court of the county where the plaintiff resides.\n\nHistory:Laws 1875-1876, ch. 2, § 1; C.L. 1884, § 1893; C.L. 1897, § 2950; Laws 1899, ch. 80, § 16; Code 1915, § 5567; C.S. 1929, § 147-101; 1941 Comp., § 19-501; Laws 1951, ch. 121, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 21-5-1; Laws 1955, ch. 258, § 1; 1957, ch. 124, § 1; 1981, ch. 70, § 1; 1988, ch. 8, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For service of process outside of state,see38-1-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor secretary of state as agent for service of process,see13-4-22 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor ability to serve civil process as prerequisite to transfer of lands between United States and New Mexico,see19-2-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor venue in criminal cases,see30-1-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor magistrate court jurisdiction,see35-3-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor venue of actions for specific performance of contracts for sale of real estate,see42-7-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor jurisdiction under Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act,see47-8-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor effect of Rules of Civil Procedure for District Courts upon venue of actions,seeRule 1-082 NMRA.\n\nFor civil process in the district court,seeRule 1-004 NMRA.\n\nThe 1988 amendment,effective February 18, 1988, made minor stylistic changes throughout the section; substituted \"Rule 4\" for \"Rule 4(g)\" in Subsection D(2); and substituted \"or in the county where a plaintiff, or any one of them in case there is more than one, resides\" for \"and not elsewhere\" in Subsection G.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nA domestic corporation does not reside in a county for venue purposessolely because its registered agent for service of process is located therein.Blancett v. Dial Oil Company, 2008-NMSC-011, 143 N.M. 368, 176 P.3d 1100.\n\nClassification of foreign corporations not violative of equal protection.— The classification of foreign corporations in this section is not so arbitrary or unreasonable as to constitute a denial of equal protection.Aetna Fin. Co. v. Gutierrez, 1981-NMSC-090, 96 N.M. 538, 632 P.2d 1176,overruled on other grounds byCooper v. Chevron USA, 2002-NMSC-020, 132 N.M. 382, 49 P.3d 61.\n\nApplication of amended section to \"pending\" cases.— Section 34 of article IV of the New Mexico Constitution, which prohibits the legislature from changing the rules of procedure applicable to any pending case, requires that venue in a suit filed prior to 1990 be governed by the pre-1990 version of 38-3-1 NMSA 1978, notwithstanding the fact that the jurisdiction of the state court was suspended while the case was removed to federal court and subsequently remanded back to the state court. Appellant's argument that as a result of the case's removal from state court to federal district court the case was not \"pending\" when the venue statute was amended was erroneous.Elephant Butte Irrigation Dist. v. Regents of N.M. State Univ., 1993-NMCA-009, 115 N.M. 229, 849 P.2d 372.\n\nEffect of supreme court decision after venue ruling.— Unsuccessful plaintiff, who had opposed defendant's motion for transfer of venue on grounds of forum non conveniens, was not entitled to Rule 1-060 NMRA relief based on a case decided subsequent to the ruling on the venue motion.Stein v. Alpine Sports, 1998-NMSC-040, 126 N.M. 258, 968 P.2d 769.\n\nVenue defined.— The venue of an action is its place of trial.Peisker v. Chavez, 1942-NMSC-004, 46 N.M. 159, 123 P.2d 726.\n\nThis venue statute is not to be equated with jurisdiction.Jones v. N.M. State Hwy. Dep't, 1979-NMSC-033, 92 N.M. 671, 593 P.2d 1074.\n\nJurisdiction and venue distinguished.— Venue in the technical meaning of the term, means the place where a case is to be tried, whereas jurisdiction does not refer to the place of trial, but to the power of the court to hear and determine the case.Kalosha v. Novick, 1973-NMSC-010, 84 N.M. 502, 505 P.2d 845.\n\nSection does not provide for the venue of cross-claims.Hughes v. Joe G. Maloof & Co., 1973-NMCA-002, 84 N.M. 516, 505 P.2d 859.\n\nDismissal without prejudice for improper venue is a final, appealable order.Sunwest Bank v. Nelson, 1998-NMSC-012, 125 N.M. 170, 958 P.2d 740.\n\nApplicability of section to condemnation proceedings.— In the absence of statute, there is no right to change the venue in a condemnation proceedings, even if such a proceeding is an action at law, and even though a change of venue is authorized by statute, a party is not entitled to such change if no good reason therefor is shown. Under a statute authorizing a change of venue in a civil action, according to some authorities, a change of venue may be had in a condemnation proceeding, on a timely application therefor, and the court to which the case is transmitted obtains jurisdiction to dispose of the condemnation proceeding. On the other hand, according to other authorities, a change of venue of the proceeding cannot be had under such statute, since a condemnation proceeding is a special proceeding.City of Tucumcari v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 1953-NMSC-046, 57 N.M. 392, 259 P.2d 351.\n\nWaiver of venue.— This section and its various subsections deal merely with venue as distinguished from jurisdiction, and the rights conferred by such section and its subsections may be waived.Kalosha v. Novick, 1973-NMSC-010, 84 N.M. 502, 505 P.2d 845.\n\nLack or want of jurisdiction of a court over the parties which is dependent upon plaintiff's residence is waived by the defendant by failure to properly present the issue prior to answering to the merits.Romero v. Hopewell, 1922-NMSC-037, 28 N.M. 259, 210 P. 231.\n\nForum non conveniens.— The doctrine of forum non conveniens is inapplicable to motions to transfer a lawsuit intrastate from one county to another.First Fin. Trust Co. v. Scott, 1996-NMSC-065, 122 N.M. 572, 929 P.2d 263.\n\nII. TRANSITORY ACTIONS GENERALLY.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The 1915 Code compilers deleted from the end of Subsection A: \"Provided, That if suit is brought against any defendant out of the county but within the judicial district in which he resides, process shall be personally served on such defendant not less than fifteen days before the first day of the term to which the process shall be returnable, and if brought in any judicial district other than that in which the defendant or either of them resides, process shall be served on such defendant or defendants not less than thirty days before the first day of the term to which said process may be returnable.\"\n\nResidency of national banking association.— A national banking association with a principal place of business in a county in New Mexico is a resident of New Mexico and of that county for purposes of venue selection under Subsection A.Sunwest Bank v. Nelson, 1998-NMSC-012, 125 N.M. 170, 958 P.2d 740.\n\nWhen there are two plaintiffs in a lawsuit action may be brought in the county in which either of them resides.Torres v. Gamble, 1966-NMSC-024, 75 N.M. 741, 410 P.2d 959.\n\nWhere transitory action is brought against more than one defendant, the residence of one of these defendants will determinethe venue of an action against all if such party is essential to the action and has not been joined merely for the purpose of bringing the action in the county of his abode.Teaver v. Miller, 1949-NMSC-043, 53 N.M. 345, 208 P.2d 156.\n\nVenue of a transitory action in the nature of quo warrantomay be in the county of residence of either plaintiff or defendant.State ex rel. Parsons Mining Co. v. McClure, 1913-NMSC-034, 17 N.M. 694, 133 P. 1063.\n\nAction in the nature of quo warranto in intrusion into office proceeding is governed by this section and must be brought in the county where the intrusion took place.State ex rel. Hannett v. District Court, 1925-NMSC-004, 30 N.M. 300, 233 P. 1002.\n\nAction by nonresident.— Where, at the time of the filing of a medical malpractice action, plaintiff no longer resided in New Mexico, under Subsection A she was required to file suit either in the county where the defendant actually resided, or where the cause of action originated, or in some other county of the judicial district wherein defendant could be actually served with a copy of the complaint and summons.Hamby v. Gonzales, 1987-NMCA-057, 105 N.M. 778, 737 P.2d 559, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 720, 737 P.2d 79.\n\nThe term \"transitory\", as used in Subsection A, does not evidence an intent by the legislature to permit a nonresident plaintiff, in her discretion, to select any county within the same judicial district in which to properly file her cause of action against the defendant.Hamby v. Gonzales, 1987-NMCA-057, 105 N.M. 778, 737 P.2d 559, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 720, 737 P.2d 79.\n\nAction by environmental improvement division.— An action by which the environmental improvement division sought an administrative warrant for inspection under the Hazardous Waste Act, Chapter 74, Article 4 NMSA 1978, is a transitory action and venue is controlled by Subsection A of this section, which allows an action to be brought in a county where the plaintiff resides.N.M. Envtl. Improvement Div. v. Climax Chem. Co., 1986-NMCA-137, 105 N.M. 439, 733 P.2d 1322, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 421, 733 P.2d 869.\n\nTortious injury to land.— Actions seeking damages or injunctive relief for tortious injury to land are transitory actions subject to the venue rules of Subsection A.Cooper v. Amerada Hess Corp., 2000-NMCA-100, 129 N.M. 710, 13 P.3d 68,aff'dsub nom. Cooper v. Chevron U.S.A., 2002-NMSC-020, 132 N.M. 382, 49 P.3d 61.\n\nVenue held proper.— Where civil suit was filed in one county of the judicial district in which defendant resided, but defendant resided in adjoining county, defendant was properly \"found in the county\" within the meaning of this subsection when, after being informed by sheriff of county where suit was filed that he was to be served with \"papers,\" he drove into that county and picked up the papers.Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Lee, 1974-NMCA-116, 86 N.M. 739, 527 P.2d 502).\n\nVenue held improper.— Where suit is between two parties resident in the same county, and arises out of a contract for the sale of real estate made and executed and to be performed in that county, venue is improper when the suit is brought in the county in which the real estate is located.Rito Cebolla Invs., Ltd. v. Golden W. Land Corp., 1980-NMCA-028, 94 N.M. 121, 607 P.2d 659.\n\nIII. ACTIONS UPON LIABILITIES ARISING FROM CRIMINAL ACTS.\n\nVenue in wrongful death action between nonresidents.— The mere fact that the wrongful act complained of may have been criminal in character can have no bearing on the transitory nature of an action to recover damages therefor. The action is transitory, and being transitory it falls squarely within the permissive effect of this section, authorizing suit against a nonresident in any county in the state and as well within the language of Section 41-2-3 NMSA 1978, authorizing a plaintiff in an action against a nonresident growing out of an accident or a collision in which the latter's automobile is involved, to file his complaint in any one of the district courts of the state.State ex rel. Appelby v. District Court, 1942-NMSC-046, 46 N.M. 376, 129 P.2d 338.\n\nIV. ACTIONS INVOLVING LAND OR INTERESTS IN LAND GENERALLY.\n\nSuit for foreclosure of mortgage on real estate.— Venue of suit for the foreclosure of a mortgage on real estate is determined by this section as the county in which the land is situated.Riverside Irrigation Co. v. Cadwell, 1916-NMSC-033, 21 N.M. 666, 158 P. 644.\n\nSuit to redeem lands from sale under decreeof court must be brought in the county where the lands are situate.Catron v. Gallup Fire Brick Co., 1929-NMSC-029, 34 N.M. 45, 277 P. 32,overruled on other grounds byKalosha v. Novick, 1973-NMSC-010, 84 N.M. 502, 505 P.2d 845.\n\nAction to compel execution of conveyance by grantees of land.— Subsection D applies to a suit to compel grantees of land to execute conveyances vesting title in judgment debtor so as to permit plaintiff to obtain execution on judgment.Atler v. Stolz, 1934-NMSC-079, 38 N.M. 529, 37 P.2d 243,overruled on other grounds byKalosha v. Novick, 1973-NMSC-010, 84 N.M. 502, 505 P.2d 845.\n\nVenue similar to quiet title venue.— Subsection D(1) is similar to the special venue provision contained in the statute authorizing an action to quiet title, 42-6-1 NMSA 1978. Both permit an action concerning land to be brought in the county in which the land or any portion of it is located.Gonzales v. Gonzales, 1993-NMCA-159, 116 N.M. 838, 867 P.2d 1220.\n\nInjunction to prohibit issuance of deed.— Venue is in the county in which the real estate involved is located when a party seeks an injunction to prohibit another from obtaining a special warranty deed, and also seeks recision of the real estate contract.Naumburg v. Cummins, 1982-NMSC-086, 98 N.M. 274, 648 P.2d 313.\n\nWhere land involved in suit was originally a part of one county,but, by various legislative enactments changing the boundaries of counties and creating new counties, it had come to be within the limits of another county, the suit was properly brought within that other county.Bent v. Maxwell Land Grant & Ry., 1884-NMSC-020, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 227, 3 P. 721.\n\nContiguous parcels in different counties.— Subsection D(2) requires that tracts located in different counties be contiguous to one another at the time the dispute arises before an exception to the general venue provision is available.Gonzales v. Gonzales, 1993-NMCA-159, 116 N.M. 838, 867 P.2d 1220.\n\nWhere petition for intervention asserted entitlement to 1/8th interest in oil and gas lease,the suit was one in which an interest in lands was the object within the meaning of this section.Heath v. Gray, 1954-NMSC-087, 58 N.M. 665, 274 P.2d 620.\n\nAction for damages for and injunction restraining further cutting of trees on land.— While suit for damages for cutting trees on land would be maintainable in county other than that in which the land was situate, where the complaint also sought injunction against further cutting of trees, and to restrain defendant from claiming any interest in the land, it involved an interest in the land, and was maintainable only in the county in which the land was situate.Jemez Land Co. v. Garcia, 1910-NMSC-013, 15 N.M. 316, 107 P. 683,overruled on other grounds byKalosha v. Novick, 1973-NMSC-010, 84 N.M. 502, 505 P.2d 845.\n\nAction for damages only.— An action against an oil and gas operation alleging property damage and personal injury, but not requesting injunctive relief, does not have land or an interest in land as its object and is not controlled by Subsection D, requiring the suit to be brought in the county where the land is situated.Cooper v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 2002-NMSC-020, 132 N.M. 382, 49 P.3d 61.\n\nDeclaratory action by city against village to determine authority over subdivision, platting and zoning of certain lands.— Venue in a declaratory suit by the city of Albuquerque against the village of Corrales and its mayor, to secure a determination of the city's authority over the subdivision, platting and zoning of lands lying within Bernalillo county within five miles of the city's boundary, should have been laid in adjoining Sandoval county where Corrales maintained all of its municipal offices and wherein all the territory it encompassed lay, except for lands which it had purportedly annexed, in Bernalillo county; the subdivision, platting and zoning authority of Albuquerque over the land in question was not an interest in land within the contemplation of Subsection D(1) of this section and the applicable venue statute was 38-3-2 NMSA 1978.City of Albuquerque v. Village of Corrales, 1975-NMSC-043, 88 N.M. 185, 539 P.2d 205.\n\nWater rights suit involving state official.— Venue for a suit governing the adjudication of water rights was properly brought in the county having jurisdiction over the stream system pursuant to Subsection D(1) as opposed to the county wherein the state engineer had his offices pursuant to Subsection (G). Because the county district court wherein the stream system was located properly had venue over the water rights adjudication, 72-4-17 NMSA 1978 required that that court have exclusive jurisdiction over all questions relating to the water rights involved, including those against the state engineer.Elephant Butte Irrigation Dist. v. Regents of N.M. State Univ., 1993-NMCA-009, 115 N.M. 229, 849 P.2d 372.\n\nWaiver of venue.Kalosha v. Novick, 1973-NMSC-010, 84 N.M. 502, 505 P.2d 845.\n\nV. ACTIONS FOR TRESPASS UPON LAND.\n\nWaiver of venue.— The county in which an action shall be tried may be agreed upon by the parties. Or if the county in which the action is brought is not the proper one for the trial thereof, the action may nevertheless be tried therein unless the defendant by proper objection demand that it be tried in the county prescribed by law. But the objection must be raised prior to trial or it will be deemed waived. And any conduct on the part of the defendant manifesting satisfaction with the venue until after the trial, or defendant's abiding by it until the matter has proceeded to a hearing will be sufficient to constitute a waiver.Heron v. Gaylor, 1948-NMSC-072, 53 N.M. 44, 201 P.2d 366.\n\nA complaint alleging trespass and nuisance properly filed as a transitory action.— Where plaintiff filed a complaint alleging trespass and nuisance in connection with the development of a wind farm, claiming that defendants, private companies in the wind energy business, damaged roads, fences, and grazing lands, removed, tampered with, or destroyed \"No Trespassing\" signs on plaintiff's property, and also created a nuisance by installing an electric grounding system on plaintiff's fence which posed a risk of serious injury or death to people, livestock and game, and where defendants sought dismissal for improper venue, claiming that because the object of plaintiff's complaint is a dispute over ownership of and access to property, the suit must be filed in the county in which the land is located rather than the county in which plaintiff resides, the district court did not err in denying defendants' motion to dismiss because the proper venue for trespass and nuisance actions seeking to restrain future invasions is the county where either the plaintiff or defendant resides, and in this case, the complaint does not have as its object land or any interests in land within the meaning of Subsection (D)(1) of this section, and was therefore properly filed as a transitory action under Subsection (E) and (A) of this section.Kaywal, Inc. v. Avangrid Renewables, Inc., 2021-NMCA-037, cert. denied.\n\nNoneconomic damages are available in trespass and private nuisance actions.— Trespass is a direct infringement of another's right of possession, and private nuisance, which is akin to trespass, is an in personam action for tortious interference with one's use and enjoyment of land. Noneconomic damages, including damages to compensate for annoyance, discomfort, and inconvenience, are available in trespass and private nuisance actions, both of which seek to remedy invasions of property rights. It is for the trier of fact to determine the amount of damages, in view of the discomfort or annoyance to which the plaintiffs have been subjected. 2024 Op. Atty Gen. No. 2024-05.\n\nVI. ACTIONS AGAINST TRANSIENTS OR NONRESIDENTS.\n\nForeign corporations with statutory agents in different counties.— Venue that is proper for one foreign corporation defendant with a statutory agent cannot establish venue for another foreign corporation defendant where the other foreign corporation maintains a statutory agent in a separate county.Bank of America v. Apache Corporation, 2008-NMCA-054, 144 N.M. 123, 184 P.3d 435, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-003, 143 N.M. 681, 180 P.3d 1180.\n\nForeign corporation and New Mexico corporation with statutory agents in different counties.— Venue that is proper for one foreign corporation defendant with a statutory agent may establish venue for a New Mexico corporation defendant even if the New Mexico corporation maintains a statutory agent and a principal place of business in another county.Bank of America v. Apache Corporation, 2008-NMCA-054, 144 N.M. 123, 184 P.3d 435, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-003, 143 N.M. 681, 180 P.3d 1180.\n\nVenue for a resident defendantis proper in the county where a defendant foreign corporation's statutory agent resides.Gardiner v. Galles Chevrolet Company, 2007-NMSC-052, 142 N.M. 544, 168 P.3d 116.\n\nAppointment of statutory agents.— Pursuant to 53-17-9 NMSA 1978, a foreign corporation may appoint a non-resident statutory agent which gives the corporation the benefit offered by the venue exceptions of Subsection F.Cooper v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 2002-NMSC-020, 132 N.M. 382, 49 P.3d 61.\n\nForeign corporation with statutory agent.— Subsection F of this section limits the proper venue in an action against a foreign corporation with a statutory agent.Baker v. BP American Prod. Co., 2005-NMSC-011, 137 N.M. 334, 110 P.3d 1071.\n\nMultiple non-resident defendants.— In actions with multiple defendants, venue for a non-resident defendant cannot determine venue for a foreign corporation with a statutory agent.Baker v. BP America Prod. Co., 2005-NMSC-011, 137 N.M. 334, 110 P.3d 1071.\n\nForeign corporations are nonresidents.— Under the plain and unambiguous language of this section, foreign corporations are considered nonresidents of this state for the purpose of venue. Thus, suits against such corporations fall under the terms of Subsection F, but suits by such corporations are governed by the provisions of Subsection A.Aetna Fin. Co. v. Gutierrez, 1981-NMSC-090, 96 N.M. 538, 632 P.2d 1176,overruled on other grounds byCooper v. Chevron USA, 2002-NMSC-020, 132 N.M. 382, 49 P.3d 61.\n\nWrongful death action between nonresidents.— An action for wrongful death, due to an automobile accident, being transitory in character, may be brought anywhere in the state when both plaintiff and defendant are nonresidents.State ex rel. Appelby v. District Court, 1942-NMSC-046, 46 N.M. 376, 129 P.2d 338.\n\nAction upon contract against nonresident.— Although this section provides that suit can be brought where a contract was made or to be performed, the section also provides that a suit can be brought against a nonresident in any county of the state.Valley Country Club, Inc. v. Mender, 1958-NMSC-042, 64 N.M. 59, 323 P.2d 1099.\n\nWhen venue is based on where a contract is to be performed, the court should determine whether the venue chosen by the plaintiff is one where a primary or principal activity of the contract is to take place.Team Bank v. Meridian Oil, Inc., 1994-NMSC-083, 118 N.M. 147, 879 P.2d 779.\n\nVII. ACTIONS AGAINST STATE OFFICERS.\n\nThe legislature has expressly localized suits against state officers by virtue of this section.Tudesque v. N.M. State Bd. of Barber Exam'rs, 1958-NMSC-128, 65 N.M. 42, 331 P.2d 1104.\n\nLocalized suits against state officers.— The legislature intended that actions against state officers be brought in Santa Fe county and not elsewhere.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Quesenberry, 1964-NMSC-043, 74 N.M. 30, 390 P.2d 273.\n\nThe words \"state officers\"as used in Subsection G of this section does not mean merely the executive department heads elected by the people and as recognized under the constitution, but includes incumbents of offices created by the legislature.Pollack v. Montoya, 1951-NMSC-056, 55 N.M. 390, 234 P.2d 336;see alsoLacy v. Silva, 1972-NMCA-064, 84 N.M. 43, 499 P.2d 361, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 37, 499 P.2d 355.\n\nPersons and bodies deemed state officers.— The bureau of revenue (now taxation and revenue department) is a state officer since it is charged with the administration and enforcement of the revenue laws through its commissioner of revenue (now secretary of taxation and revenue).State ex rel. Bureau of Revenue v. MacPherson, 1968-NMSC-106, 79 N.M. 272, 442 P.2d 584,overruled on other grounds byN.M. Livestock Bd. v. Dose, 1980-NMSC-022, 94 N.M. 68, 607 P.2d 606.\n\nThe board of barber examiners (now board of barbers and cosmetologists), with statutory situs in Santa Fe, has been clothed by the legislature with powers and duties of statewide scope, the exercise of which involves some portion of the governmental power. Hence the board itself, as well as its component members, is a state officer as such within the meaning of Subsection G of this section.Tudesque v. N.M. State Bd. of Barber Exam'rs, 1958-NMSC-128, 65 N.M. 42, 331 P.2d 1104.\n\nThe commissioner of revenue (now secretary of taxation and revenue) is a state officer.State ex rel. Bureau of Revenue v. MacPherson, 1968-NMSC-106, 79 N.M. 272, 442 P.2d 584,overruled on other grounds byN.M. Livestock Bd. v. Dose, 1980-NMSC-022, 94 N.M. 68, 607 P.2d 606.\n\nSovereign power is clearly vested in the office of the commissioner of revenue (now secretary of taxation and revenue) and this office is therefore a state office.Lacy v. Silva, 1972-NMCA-064, 84 N.M. 43, 499 P.2d 361, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 37, 499 P.2d 355.\n\nA district director (now division director) of revenue is not autonomous and is not independent, therefore, sovereign power has not been vested with the district director either by the legislature or by the commissioner pursuant to legislative authority and absent a vesting of sovereign power in the district director, he is not an \"officer\" within the meaning of Subsection G of this section.Lacy v. Silva, 1972-NMCA-064, 84 N.M. 43, 499 P.2d 361, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 37, 499 P.2d 355.\n\nChief of division of liquor control (now director of department of alcoholic beverage control) is a state officer within terms of Subsection G of this section requiring civil actions brought against state officers to be brought in the county where the office is located.Pollack v. Montoya, 1951-NMSC-056, 55 N.M. 390, 234 P.2d 336.\n\nState highway commissioners are state officerswithin the meaning of this statute.Jones v. N.M. State Hwy. Dep't, 1979-NMSC-033, 92 N.M. 671, 593 P.2d 1074.\n\nSection applicable to actions against state officers for acts committed while purporting to act within scope of official authority or capacity.— Statutes which prescribe venue for suits against state officers, for acts done by virtue of their office, control suits for acts done by them while purporting to act within the scope of authority or official capacity.Allen v. McClellan, 1967-NMSC-114, 77 N.M. 801, 427 P.2d 677,overruled on other grounds byN.M. Livestock Bd. v. Dose, 1980-NMSC-022, 94 N.M. 68, 607 P.2d 606.\n\nActs committed while purporting to act within scope of official authority or capacity.— Where it was not asserted that alleged wrongful acts were committed by defendants while purporting to act within the scope of their official authority or capacity, the provisions of this section were not applicable.Allen v. McClellan, 1967-NMSC-114, 77 N.M. 801, 427 P.2d 677,overruled on other grounds byN.M. Livestock Bd. v. Dose, 1980-NMSC-022, 94 N.M. 68, 607 P.2d 606.\n\nWhere plaintiff's claim was that the conduct of the district director (now division director) of revenue which gave rise to the filing of the criminal complaint was entirely outside the scope of his employment with the state of New Mexico and plaintiff sought damages only against the district director and on the basis of acts outside the scope of his employment, this section was not applicable.Lacy v. Silva, 1972-NMCA-064, 84 N.M. 43, 499 P.2d 361, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 37, 499 P.2d 355.\n\nInjunctive proceedings against state officers.— Statutes which prescribe venue for suits against state officers, for acts done by virtue of their office, control suits for acts done by them while purporting to act within the scope of authority or official capacity. These same rules apply to suits for injunction against such officers.Allen v. McClellan, 1967-NMSC-114, 77 N.M. 801, 427 P.2d 677,overruled on other grounds byN.M. Livestock Bd. v. Dose, 1980-NMSC-022, 94 N.M. 68, 607 P.2d 606.\n\nMandamus proceedings against state officers.— This section cannot be considered as a means of ousting a court of jurisdiction once that jurisdiction has attached; and this is particularly true where the state commission originally sought the aid of the court in another county by seeking relief, such as, in the condemnation of property. Therefore, Subsection G is not controlling, and it was within the jurisdiction of the trial court to issue, in the primary case, its writ of mandamus against appellant, which had initially applied to that same court for relief.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Quesenberry, 1964-NMSC-043, 74 N.M. 30, 390 P.2d 273.\n\nSection inapplicable to action for release of funds held by department.— An action for the release of funds held by the human services department [health care authority department] pursuant to a court order is not a \"suit against a state officer\" but is an exercise by a court of its continuing jurisdiction; thus, this section is inapplicable.In re Estate of Guerra, 1981-NMCA-063, 96 N.M. 608, 633 P.2d 716.\n\nSection requires only venue be proper when action is commenced.Valdez v. Ballenger, 1978-NMSC-055, 91 N.M. 785, 581 P.2d 1280.\n\nSuits against state officers may be brought in Santa Fe county,where the capital is located.Jacobs v. Stratton, 1980-NMSC-091, 94 N.M. 665, 615 P.2d 982.\n\nSubsection G is not jurisdictional;prior cases so holding are overruled.N.M. Livestock Bd. v. Dose, 1980-NMSC-022, 94 N.M. 68, 607 P.2d 606.\n\nVenue should not be equated with jurisdiction in suits against state,its officers or employees.N.M. Livestock Bd. v. Dose, 1980-NMSC-022, 94 N.M. 68, 607 P.2d 606.\n\nApplicability of Subsection G to state educational institutions.— This section, not 41-4-18 NMSA 1978, the venue provision of the Tort Claims Act, applies to all tort actions brought against state educational institutions or employees thereof.Clothier v. Lopez, 1985-NMSC-088, 103 N.M. 593, 711 P.2d 870.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Survey of New Mexico Law, 1979-80: Administrative Law,\" see 11 N.M.L.

Const., art. VI, § 18.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective March 19, 2003, deleted former designation A and redesignated former A(1), A(2), A(2)(a) to A(2)(d) as designations A, B, B(1) to B(4) respectively; substituted \"another country\" for \"some country\" in the introductory paragraph; in Paragraph B(3) deleted \"because\" at the beginning; substituted \"in the case\" for \"therein\" in present Paragraph B(3); deleted former Subsection B which provided that any party in any civil or criminal case who objects to a change of venue shall move for a change of venue on or before the first day of any regular or special term of court; and deleted Subsection C which read: \"If the motion for change of venue is filed in vacation, five days' notice of the time and place of presenting the motion must be given to the opposite party or his attorney\".\n\nNecessity of proving that no fair trial can be had.— A court which renders the initial decree in child custody and visitation proceedings is the proper venue for subsequent modifications over other district courts of this state. A change of venue for \"other cause\" under Section 38-3-3A(2)(d) NMSA 1978 (now 38-3-3B(4) NMSA 1978) requires that the movant show that the movant cannot get a fair trial without a change of venue.Dugie v. Cameron, 1999-NMSC-002, 126 N.M. 433, 971 P.2d 390.\n\nVoir dire answers.— Answers of prospective jurors to questions on voir dire was evidence to be considered in deciding the venue motions. The evidence of the answers moved the venue question out of the mandatory provisions of Section 38-3-3A NMSA 1978, and into the discretionary provisions of Section 38-3-5, NMSA 1978.State v. Montano, 1979-NMCA-101, 93 N.M. 436, 601 P.2d 69.\n\nThe legislature intended Section 38-3-3A NMSA 1978 to apply to the single-judge districtsof the territorial courts and early statehood and is now without force or effect.Cook v. Anding, 2008-NMSC-035, 144 N.M. 400, 188 P.3d 1151.\n\nPower of trial court to order change of venue upon own motion.— A trial court, in a proper case and in the exercise of its discretion, has the power to order a change of venue sua sponte. This power existed at common law and the common law is the rule of practice and decision in New Mexico.Valdez v. State, 1972-NMSC-029, 83 N.M. 720, 497 P.2d 231, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1077, 93 S. Ct. 694, 34 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1972).\n\nChange of venue may be based on presumed prejudice or on actual prejudice.— The trial court may change venue based on presumed prejudice or on actual prejudice; presumed prejudice arises when the evidence shows that the community is so saturated with inflammatory publicity about the crime that it must be presumed that the trial proceedings are tainted; actual prejudice requires a direct investigation into the attitudes of potential jurors during voir dire to establish whether there is such widespread and fixed prejudice within the jury pool that a fair trial in that venue would be impossible.State v Astorga, 2015-NMSC-007.\n\nWhere district court found insufficient evidence of presumed prejudice and proceeded to voir dire, potential jurors filled out extensive questionnaires, and over the course of voir dire, each potential juror was questioned regarding actual prejudice, jurors who could not be impartial were excused, and the jury that was finally impaneled was composed of jurors who affirmed their ability to remain impartial, defendant's right to a fair and impartial jury was safeguarded, and the district court did not err in denying defendant's motion to change venue.State v Astorga, 2015-NMSC-007.\n\nCourt not to change venue of misfiled suit.— Absent a statute giving it such authority, a trial court has no power to change the venue of a misfiled lawsuit.Jones v. N.M. State Hwy. Dep't, 1979-NMSC-033, 92 N.M. 671, 593 P.2d 1074.\n\nThe trial court may not transfer venue of a misfiled suit.Team Bank v. Meridian Oil, Inc., 1994-NMSC-083, 118 N.M. 147, 879 P.2d 779.\n\nChange of venue over objection of defendant in criminal case.— The venue of a criminal case may be changed on application of the state, even over the objection of the defendant, where public excitement and local prejudice would prevent a fair trial.State v. Archer, 1927-NMSC-002, 32 N.M. 319, 255 P. 396;see alsoState v. Holloway, 1914-NMSC-086, 19 N.M. 528, 146 P. 1066,but seeState v. Tijerina, 1972-NMCA-169, 84 N.M. 432, 504 P.2d 642,aff'd, 1973-NMSC-105, 86 N.M. 31, 519 P.2d 127, cert. denied, 417 U.S. 956, 94 S. Ct. 3085, 41 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1974).\n\nWaiver of constitutional vicinage.— Once defendant has successfully moved for a change of venue, he cannot subsequently claim a constitutional right to the original venue, as he has waived his right to trial in the county of constitutional vicinage.State v. House, 1999-NMSC-014, 127 N.M. 151, 978 P.2d 967.\n\nRequirements as to form and time for filing of motion for change of venue.Valdez v. State, 1972-NMSC-029, 83 N.M. 720, 497 P.2d 231, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1077, 93 S. Ct. 694, 34 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1972);State v. Aull, 1967-NMSC-233, 78 N.M. 607, 435 P.2d 437, cert. denied, 391 U.S. 927, 88 S. Ct. 1829, 20 L. Ed. 2d 688 (1968);Askew v. Fort Sumner Irrigation Dist., 1968-NMCA-084, 79 N.M. 671, 448 P.2d 183;State v. Lindsey, 1969-NMCA-121, 81 N.M. 173, 464 P.2d 903, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 140, 464 P.2d 559 (1970), and cert. denied, 398 U.S. 904, 90 S. Ct. 1692, 26 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1970);State v. Tapia, 1970-NMCA-037, 81 N.M. 365, 467 P.2d 31.\n\nProcedure required upon motion generally.— When requisite motion to change venue is made, the venue must be changed or, in the alternative, the court may require evidence in its support; if a hearing is had thereon, it is the duty of the court to determine the question by its findings.State v. Fernandez, 1952-NMSC-087, 56 N.M. 689, 248 P.2d 679.\n\nThe provisions of this section are mandatory when the prescribed steps have been taken, unless evidence is called for. The mandatory provisions become discretionary once additional evidence is requested.State v. Turner, 1976-NMCA-119, 90 N.M. 79, 559 P.2d 1206, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 9, 558 P.2d 621 (1977).See also38-3-5 NMSA 1978.\n\nProcedure when motion based upon ground of interest of judge.— This section and 38-3-5 NMSA 1978 do not require any evidence in support of the motion for change of venue when based upon the interest of the judge, and dispense with any findings by the judge upon that question.State ex rel. Hannah v.

House, 1999-NMSC-014, 127 N.M. 151, 978 P.2d 967.\n\nResponsive pleading to motion not required.— In the absence of statutory requirement no answer or other pleading is required to a motion for change of venue.State v.

State, 1969-NMSC-029, 80 N.M. 77, 451 P.2d 981.\n\nThere is no statutory requirement for filing of a responsive pleading to a motion for change of venue, and the state's failure to controvert the motion cannot be made the basis for concluding that movant is entitled to a change of venue as a matter of law.State v. Montoya, 1968-NMCA-069, 80 N.M. 64, 451 P.2d 557;aff'dsub nom. Deats v. State, 1969-NMSC-029, 80 N.M. 77, 451 P.2d 981.\n\nBurden of proof when a motion and affidavit are submitted for a change of venueremains on the moving party and, when evidence is produced, that evidence must be persuasive of the probability that a fair trial cannot be obtained in the county where the cause is pending.Deats v. State, 1969-NMSC-029, 80 N.M. 77, 451 P.2d 981.\n\nThe mere fact no counter-evidence was presented by the state in response to motion for change of venue furnished no basis for a holding that movant was entitled to a change of venue as a matter of law since the burden of proof on the removal motion was on movant.State v. Montoya, 1968-NMCA-069, 80 N.M. 64, 451 P.2d 557,aff'dsub nom. Deats v. State, 1969-NMSC-029, 80 N.M. 77, 451 P.2d 981.\n\nExposure of venire members to publicityabout a case by itself does not establish prejudice or create a presumption of prejudice.State v. Chamberlain, 1991-NMSC-094, 112 N.M. 723, 819 P.2d 673.\n\nPotential venue problem cured by instruction.— Trial court did not abuse its discretion in holding trial in courtroom of building where crime scene was located; any possible prejudice to defendant was cured by instructions to jury that they were not to visit the crime scene on their own.State v. Hernandez, 1998-NMCA-167, 126 N.M. 377, 970 P.2d 149, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 533, 972 P.2d 352.\n\nSufficiency of showing of grounds for change of venue.— This section does not mean that it must be conclusively shown that it is impossible to have a fair trial in the county where the venue is laid, but it is sufficient to show a reasonable apprehension that the defendant will not secure a fair trial or that the jury is under an influence inimical to the accused.State v. Alaniz, 1951-NMSC-049, 55 N.M. 312, 232 P.2d 982;McCauley v. Ray, 1968-NMSC-194, 80 N.M. 171, 453 P.2d 192.\n\nMedia publicity.— Numerous newspaper articles and radio and television stories wherein an accused was mentioned, without more, did not necessarily establish prejudice or such public excitement as would make a fair trial impossible, and a change of venue necessary.Deats v. State, 1969-NMSC-029, 80 N.M. 77, 451 P.2d 981.\n\nEvidentiary hearing on motion permitted.— In a case in which there has been no preceding changes of venue, the right to a venue change is generally mandatory and must be granted; however, if the trial court determines that evidence in support of the motion is required, it may hold an evidentiary hearing.State v. Mantelli, 2002-NMCA-033, 131 N.M. 692, 42 P.3d 272, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 737, 42 P.3d 842.\n\nFailure to request specific findings upon motion precludes appellate review.— Though a defendant moves for change of venue in murder trial, if he does not request specific findings with reference thereto from the trial court, denial of the motion is not open for appellate review.State v. Fernandez, 1952-NMSC-087, 56 N.M. 689, 248 P.2d 679.\n\nStandard of review of trial court's denial of motion to change venue.— If the trial court denies a motion to change venue based on presumed prejudice and proceeds with voir dire, an appellate court's review is limited to the evidence of actual prejudice. The determination of actual prejudice requires a direct investigation into the attitudes of potential jurors. A finding of no actual prejudice following voir dire, if supported by substantial evidence, necessarily precludes a finding of presumed prejudice. To prove that reversible error occurred during voir dire, the defendant must show that the trial court abused its discretion by not excusing a juror who demonstrated actual prejudice.State v. Romero, 2019-NMSC-007.\n\nTrial court did not abuse its discretion in denying motion to change venue.— In defendant's trial for first-degree murder for the killing of a police officer, where defendant renewed a motion to change venue after voir dire was complete and a jury selected, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion, because each empaneled juror affirmed the ability to be a neutral finder of fact, and therefore voir dire revealed no actual prejudice in the jury selected.State v. Romero, 2019-NMSC-007.\n\nStandard of appellate review.— An order of a district court denying a motion for a change of venue will not be reversed by the supreme court unless the record shows an abuse of discretion.State v. Ancheta, 1915-NMSC-003, 20 N.M. 19, 145 P. 1086;Territory v. Cheney, 1911-NMSC-050, 16 N.M. 476, 120 P. 335.\n\nFindings made on a motion to change venue will not be disturbed upon review unless it appears from the evidence that the trial court acted unfairly and committed palpable abuse of discretion.State v. Fernandez, 1952-NMSC-087, 56 N.M. 689, 248 P.2d 679.\n\nAn appellate court will reverse a trial court's denial of a motion for change of venue only when it is shown that the trial court acted unfairly or committed a palpable abuse of discretion.McCauley v. Ray, 1968-NMSC-194, 80 N.M. 171, 453 P.2d 192.\n\nThe determination, as to whether a change of venue should be granted after a hearing on a motion rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, and this determination will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of abuse of this discretion and the burden of showing such an abuse rests on the movant.State v. Rushing, 1973-NMSC-092, 85 N.M. 540, 514 P.2d 297.\n\nThe trial court possesses broad discretion in ruling on motions to change venue, and the supreme court will not disturb its decision absent a showing of an abuse of that discretion.State v. Chamberlain, 1991-NMSC-094, 112 N.M. 723, 819 P.2d 673.\n\nBurden of showing abuse of discretion.— The burden to show an abuse of discretion in the case of a ruling on a motion for change of venue lies with the movant.State v. Chamberlain, 1991-NMSC-094, 112 N.M. 723, 819 P.2d 673.\n\nMotion properly denied.— Where defendant drove a pickup toward a group of trick-or-treaters on Halloween; the chaperone pushed the children out of the way but was struck and killed; defendant then left the scene of the accident; because of the local media coverage, defendant moved for a change of venue; the district court denied the motion, called two jury panels for selection and conducted voir dire; the court asked pointed questions to potential jurors who had heard of the case, including questions that asked those jurors to assess the impact of the publicity on their ability to be fair, whether they could evaluate the evidence without reference to information external to the court proceeding, and whether they had come to any conclusions about who was responsible for the accident; defendant had an opportunity to question jurors; and defendant did not point to any actual prejudice on the part of any juror, the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to change the venue.State v. Melendrez, 2014-NMCA-062, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-006.\n\nWhere the child, who was charged with murder, asked for a change of venue on the grounds that pre-trial publicity and public excitement surrounding the case would make it impossible for the child to obtain a fair trial by an impartial jury; the pre-trial publicity occurred when the child escaped from detention; no publicity occurred after the child was recaptured; substantial time elapsed between the publicity and the trial; the publicity consisted of newspaper articles and editorials, online forum postings, and a program on the television show \"America's Most Wanted\"; and voir dire by the trial court and defense counsel did not reveal any prejudice of the jury panel from the pre-trial publicity, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to change venue.State v. Gutierrez, 2011-NMSC-024, 150 N.M. 232, 258 P.3d 1024.\n\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's change of venue motion where substantial evidence supported the court's determination that there was no evidence of actual prejudice among the members of the jury. State v. Barrera, 2001-NMSC-014, 130 N.M. 227, 22 P.3d 1177.\n\nTrial court did not abuse its discretion in denying oral request for change of venue where defendant presented no evidence indicating that she was deprived of a fair and impartial jury.State v. Wynne, 1988-NMCA-106, 108 N.M. 134, 767 P.2d 373.\n\nDenial of motion held error.— Where defendant filed a proper motion for change of venue showing circumstances whereunder he could not obtain fair trial, such charges not being controverted, trial court committed prejudicial error in not sustaining his motion for it.State v. Alaniz, 1951-NMSC-049, 55 N.M. 312, 232 P.2d 982.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Survey of New Mexico Law, 1982-83: Civil Procedure,\" see 14 N.M.L.

District Court, 7 N.M. 486, 38 P. 580 (1894), the territorial supreme court held this section \"null and void insofar as it attempts to confer an abstract power upon a court which had been deprived by absolute legal statutory enactment as well as by necessary implication and operation of law, of jurisdiction in territorial causes.\" The basis was that under U.S. Rev. jurisdictions could be divided and by Laws 1889, ch. 6, they were divided, and only congress could restore the prior status to the court which it had created, and in addition that the section depended upon the Jury Act of 1889 (ch. 96) which had been held in conflict with the Springer Act and \"fell with it.\" The section was included in its original form as Comp.

      "heading": "Peremptory challenge to a district judge.",
      "text": "A party to an action or proceeding, civil or criminal, including proceedings for indirect criminal contempt arising out of oral or written publications, except actions or proceedings for constructive and other indirect contempt or direct contempt shall have the right to exercise a peremptory challenge to the district judge before whom the action or proceeding is to be tried and heard, whether he be the resident district judge or a district judge designated by the resident district judge, except by consent of the parties or their counsel. After the exercise of a peremptory challenge, that district judge shall proceed no further. Each party to an action or proceeding may excuse only one district judge pursuant to the provisions of this statute. In all actions brought under the Workmen's Compensation Act (52-1-1 to 52-1-69 NMSA 1978) [Workers' Compensation Act (Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978)], the employer and the insurance carrier of the employer shall be treated as one party when exercising a peremptory challenge to the judge under this statute. The rights created by this section are in addition to any arising under Article 6 of the constitution of New Mexico.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 38-3-9, enacted by Laws 1985, ch. 91, § 1.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1985, ch. 91, § 1 repealed former 38-3-9 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1977, ch. 228, § 1, and enacted a new section.\n\nCross references.— For motion for change of venue upon ground of interest or relationship with party of judge,see38-3-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor disqualification of judges,seeN.M. Const., art. VI, § 18.\n\nFor disqualification of probate judges,see34-7-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nAuthority to review timeliness and correctness of a peremptory challenge.— A district court judge has the authority to decide whether a peremptory challenge filed against the judge is both timely and correct. The authority of the district judge necessarily entails an examination of whether the party seeking to exercise the peremptory challenge is entitled to do so at the time the challenge is made and whether the party has a sufficient diversity of interest from that of other parties to entitle the party to exercise an independent right of excusal without cause.Quality Automotive Ctr. LLC v. Arrieta, 2013-NMSC-041.\n\nWhere respondents' original complaint for wrongful death named Quality Tire & Service as defendant; counsel for Quality Tire & Service filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that Quality Tire & Service did not exist because the owners had sold the business prior to the accident to Oscar Chavez, who operated a business known as \"Quality Automotive Center\", and who formed \"Quality Automotive Center, LLC\" after plaintiffs filed the complaint; the motion to dismiss contained defense counsel's representation of the original owners and Oscar Chavez; plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that named Oscar Chaves and Quality Automotive Center, LLC as defendants; defense counsel entered an appearance on behalf of defendants and filed a notice of peremptory excusal and a motion to dismiss on behalf of Quality Automotive Center, LLC; and the motion to dismiss indicated that Oscar Chavez was the sole organizer and manager of Quality Automotive Center, LLC, the district court had authority to review the peremptory excusal and to determine whether Quality Automotive Center, LLC and Oscar Chaves had a sufficient diversity of interest to entitle Quality Automotive Center, LLC to exercise a separate peremptory challenge.Quality Automotive Ctr. LLC v. Arrieta, 2013-NMSC-041.\n\nConstitutionality of section.— This section does not violate any of the following articles and sections of the constitution: N.M. const., art. II, § 18; art. III; art. IV, § 34; art. VI, § 18.State ex rel. Hannah v. Armijo, 1933-NMSC-087, 38 N.M. 73, 28 P.2d 511.\n\nSection provides a procedural method of disqualification,therefore the supreme court can modify it by rule.State ex rel. Gesswein v. Galvan, 1984-NMSC-025, 100 N.M. 769, 676 P.2d 1334.\n\nSection not exclusive disqualification method.— The right of disqualification provided by this section is not the exclusive method of disqualification.United Nuclear Corp. v. Gen. Atomic Co., 1980-NMSC-094, 96 N.M. 155, 629 P.2d 231, appeal dismissed, 451 U.S. 901, 101 S. Ct. 1966, 68 L. Ed. 2d 289 (1981).\n\nThis section does not apply in direct contempt cases.State v. Pothier, 1986-NMSC-039, 104 N.M. 363, 721 P.2d 1294.\n\nSection clearly gives to \"a party\" - that is to each party - the right to disqualifythe judge before whom the action or proceeding is to be tried and heard.Romero v. Felter, 1972-NMSC-032, 83 N.M. 736, 497 P.2d 738.\n\nThe state is a \"party\" to a criminal caseand entitled to file an affidavit of disqualification of a district judge.State ex rel. Tittman v. Hay, 1936-NMSC-049, 40 N.M. 370, 60 P.2d 353.\n\nOne who had petitioned to intervene was not a partyto an action within the meaning of this section, where order allowing intervention had not been made.State ex rel. Lebeck v. Chavez, 1941-NMSC-016, 45 N.M. 161, 113 P.2d 179.\n\nIntervenor.— While a wife of property owner was permitted to intervene in condemnation proceeding, she was not a party in the sense of one entitled to disqualify a trial judge, regardless of whether she must by statute be brought into the suit as a party.Harms v. Coors, 1946-NMSC-008, 50 N.M. 12, 167 P.2d 353.\n\nWhere claim is prosecuted under Workmen's [Workers'] Compensation Act, the action taken is a \"proceeding\"within the terms of this section.State ex rel. Pac. Emp'rs Ins. Co. v. Arledge, 1950-NMSC-039, 54 N.M. 267, 221 P.2d 562.\n\nSection exclusive method for disqualification of judge by party.— This section only addresses itself to the issue of a party disqualifying a judge and it appears to be the exclusive method by which a party may disqualify the presiding judge.Doe v. State, 1977-NMSC-075, 91 N.M. 51, 570 P.2d 589.\n\nSection authorizes the disqualification of only one judge by a party.Beall v. Reidy, 1969-NMSC-092, 80 N.M. 444, 457 P.2d 376.\n\nDisqualified judge is the one before whom the case is to be tried.Gray v. Sanchez, 1974-NMSC-011, 86 N.M. 146, 520 P.2d 1091;Beall v. Reidy, 1969-NMSC-092, 80 N.M. 444, 457 P.2d 376.\n\nPeremptory challenge in second case where first indictment dismissed nolle prosequi.— Defendant's peremptory challenge was timely since the defendant filed it within ten days after a second indictment was brought against him subsequent to the dismissal of the first indictment based on nolle prosequi. The defendant's right to disqualify the judge attached upon the filing of the second indictment because nolle prosequi ended the prior criminal proceeding.State v. Ware, 1993-NMCA-041, 115 N.M. 339, 850 P.2d 1042, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 228, 849 P.2d 371.\n\nDisqualification barred after party invokes court's discretion.— A judge may not be statutorily disqualified under this section after a party has invoked the discretion of the court.Smith v. Martinez, 1981-NMSC-066, 96 N.M. 440, 631 P.2d 1308;State v. Mantelli, 2002-NMCA-033, 131 N.M. 692, 42 P.3d 272, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 737, 42 P.3d 842.\n\nThe determinative issue is whether a party has invoked the judicial discretion of the court; if so, that party may not excuse the judge.JMB Retail Properties Co. v. Eastburn, 1992-NMSC-045, 114 N.M. 115, 835 P.2d 831.\n\nTest for determining if discretion involved.— The rule that a judge may not be peremptorily challenged after a party has invoked the discretion of the court depends, not upon whether the court in fact exercised discretion, but upon whether the response of the court was subject to discretion.JMB Retail Properties Co. v. Eastburn, 1992-NMSC-045, 114 N.M. 115, 835 P.2d 831.\n\nWhat constitutes discretionary act.— An extension of time to answer or otherwise plead is a discretionary act, even if in response to the agreed motion or stipulation of the parties, and, therefore, disqualification of a judge who had granted such a motion was not allowed.JMB Retail Properties Co. v. Eastburn, 1992-NMSC-045, 114 N.M. 115, 835 P.2d 831.\n\nSection applicable to juvenile court judges.Frazier v. Stanley, 1972-NMSC-028, 83 N.M. 719, 497 P.2d 230;Smith v. Martinez, 1981-NMSC-066, 96 N.M. 440, 631 P.2d 1308.\n\nSection not applicable to small claims court judges.Stein v. Speer, 1973-NMSC-070, 85 N.M. 418, 512 P.2d 1254.\n\nSection not applicable to probate judges.Estate of Tarlton, 1972-NMSC-060, 84 N.M. 95, 500 P.2d 180.\n\nLanguage of section is absolute and mandatory.— No discretion is vested in the judge against whom the affidavit is filed as to his disqualification, if the application is timely made.State ex rel.

Reese, 1981-NMSC-112, 96 N.M. 728, 634 P.2d 1280.\n\nDisqualification affidavit to trial judge.— An affidavit of disqualification must be directed only to the judge before whom the case is to be tried on the merits.Demers v.

Demers, 1978-NMSC-097, 92 N.M. 396, 589 P.2d 180.\n\nParties have no statutory right to disqualify judge designated by the chief justice.State v.

Reese, 1981-NMSC-112, 96 N.M. 728, 634 P.2d 1280.\n\nDesignated replacement judge subject to disqualification.— If the resident judge for any reason is unable to be present to try and hear the case, or decides not to try and hear the case, and another judge is designated, the judge designated is subject to disqualification.Martinez v. Carmona, 1980-NMCA-139, 95 N.M. 545, 624 P.2d 54, cert. quashed, 95 N.M. 593, 624 P.2d 535 (1981).\n\nDisqualification of presiding district judge is accomplished when affidavit provided for in this section is timely made.State ex rel. Weltmer v. Taylor, 1938-NMSC-035, 42 N.M. 405, 79 P.2d 937.\n\nAffidavit of prejudice.— The filing of the affidavit of prejudice, after the case is at issue, in the manner and form prescribed by this section and 38-3-10 NMSA 1978, ipso facto divests the judge of all further jurisdiction in the case, and his subsequent proceedings are without jurisdiction and null and void.Rivera v. Hutchings, 1955-NMSC-049, 59 N.M. 337, 284 P.2d 222.\n\nIn an action for which a judge may be disqualified by the timely filing of statutory affidavit, the judge is ipso facto divested of all further jurisdiction in the case, and his subsequent proceedings are without jurisdiction and null and void.Norton v. Reese, 1966-NMSC-154, 76 N.M. 602, 417 P.2d 205.\n\nDisqualification may be waived.— Where the judge is disqualified effective when the affidavit is filed, thereafter he has no jurisdiction to act in the case, but such disqualification may be waived.State v. Latham, 1972-NMCA-025, 83 N.M. 530, 494 P.2d 192.\n\nDisqualification for prejudice may be waived, and it is waived by implication as well as by specific acts of the party having a right to rely thereupon.State ex rel. Lebeck v. Chavez, 1941-NMSC-016, 45 N.M. 161, 113 P.2d 179.\n\nDisqualification of trial judge may be waived both expressly and by implication, and where defendant on trial for murder, after having filed affidavit of disqualification, appeared voluntarily asking the judge to accept a plea of guilty of second degree murder, the disqualification was waived.State v. Garcia, 1943-NMSC-040, 47 N.M. 319, 142 P.2d 552.\n\nWhere the judge, after striking the affidavit of disqualification, set the case for trial, defendant made no effort to prohibit the judge from trying the case, defendant appeared on set date and requested a continuance and this continuance was granted, the judge's prior disqualification was effectively waived.State v. Latham, 1972-NMCA-025, 83 N.M. 530, 494 P.2d 192.\n\nAfter submitting to a judge the sufficiency of a petition for recount of votes, the question of the disqualification of the judge could not thereafter be raised.State ex rel.

Chavez, 1941-NMSC-016, 45 N.M. 161, 113 P.2d 179.\n\nIf a party requests ruling on a motion for change of venue, he thereby loses his right to disqualify the judge in view of this section.State v. Garcia, 1943-NMSC-040, 47 N.M. 319, 142 P.2d 552.\n\nJudge may perform mere formal acts after disqualification.— The mere signing, by disqualified judge, of certificate compelling attendance of a witness was a formal act and did not invoke a question of jurisdiction. A judge may properly perform mere formal acts after his disqualification.State v. James, 1966-NMSC-110, 76 N.M. 376, 415 P.2d 350.\n\nPreliminary matters heard by disqualified judge.— A judge has no jurisdiction to hear a petition for preliminary injunctive relief after having been disqualified. A proceeding for a preliminary injunction is not a \"mere formal act\" such as has been contemplated to fall within the \"preliminary matter\" language of Paragraph A of Rule 1.088.1.Borrego v. El Guique Community Ditch Ass'n, 1988-NMSC-081, 107 N.M. 594, 762 P.2d 256 (decided under pre-1988 version of Rule 1-088.1 NMRA).\n\nConsolidation order after timely disqualification invalid.— Where affidavit of disqualification was timely filed, judge's subsequent consolidation order was without legal effect.Pueblo of Laguna v.

Weltmer v. Taylor, 1938-NMSC-035, 42 N.M. 405, 79 P.2d 937.\n\nWhere it was shown that compensation for one of plaintiff's attorneys, who was the son of the presiding judge,was on a contingent basis, the judge was disqualified.Tharp v. Massengill, 1933-NMSC-105, 38 N.M. 58, 28 P.2d 502.\n\nFiling of provisional affidavit.— Though parties may not know before which of two or more eligible judges a case will come on for trial, the party seeking disqualification of one honestly believed by him to be biased could make a provisional affidavit, reciting the facts and adding \"that if the judge before whom the case is to be tried or heard should be judge ______, then according to affiant's belief such judge cannot preside over the same with impartiality, etc.\"Notargiacomo v. Hickman, 1951-NMSC-069, 55 N.M. 465, 235 P.2d 531;see alsoGray v. Sanchez, 1974-NMSC-011, 86 N.M. 146, 520 P.2d 1091.\n\nExecution of affidavit.— The section is explicit; the affidavit must be executed by a party.
