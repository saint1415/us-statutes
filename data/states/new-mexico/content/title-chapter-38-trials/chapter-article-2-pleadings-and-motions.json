In the context of class action or mass-tort litigation, the most economical and feasible method of informing potential litigants of prospective litigation affecting their interests may be through the press. The use of the press as a conduit to communicate with additional potential class action or mass-tort litigants may be reasonably related to the object of the completed judicial proceeding.Helena Chem. Co. v. Uribe, 2012-NMSC-021, 281 P.3d 237,rev'g2011-NMCA-060, 149 N.M. 789, 255 P.3d 367.\n\nAbsolute-privilege defense applies to pre-litigation statements to the press.— The absolute privilege doctrine applies to pre-litigation statements made by attorneys in the presence of the press, if (1) the speaker is seriously and in good faith contemplating class action or mass-tort litigation at the time the statement is made, (2) the statement is reasonably related to the proposed litigation, (3) the attorney has a client or identifiable prospective client at the time the statement is made, and (4) the statement is made while the attorney is acting in the capacity of counsel or prospective counsel.Helena Chem. Co. v. Uribe, 2012-NMSC-021, 281 P.3d 237,rev'g2011-NMCA-060, 149 N.M. 789, 255 P.3d 367.\n\nWhere the residents of a community, who were concerned about environmental and health hazards caused by toxic chemicals emanating from plaintiff's plant, invited attorneys, who were experienced environmental attorneys and who had previously filed a toxic tort action against plaintiff for similar environmental and health hazards, to discuss community concerns and possible litigation against plaintiff; the residents also invited a political blogger to attend the meeting in the capacity of a news reporter to inform the public about the resident's environmental and health concerns and that litigations was contemplated; and at the meeting, one of the attorneys made statements, which the blogger reported on the blogger's website, about children playing outside the meeting and ingesting the toxic chemicals and about plaintiff's egregious actions, the statements made by the attorney were absolutely privileged because the statements were made when a mass-tort lawsuit was seriously and in good faith contemplated, and with the objective of investigating the merits of potential litigation and identifying for the community those members who may have had a good-faith basis for pursuing the litigation and the statements were made when the attorney had identifiable prospective clients and while the attorney was acting in the capacity of prospective counsel.Helena Chem. Co. v. Uribe, 2012-NMSC-021, 281 P.3d 237,rev'g2011-NMCA-060, 149 N.M. 789, 255 P.3d 367.\n\nStatements made by litigants or their attorneys to the press after a lawsuit has been filed are absolutely privileged if the statements are a repetition or an explanation of the allegations in the pleadings.Helena Chem. Co. v. Uribe, 2012-NMSC-021, 281 P.3d 237,rev'g2011-NMCA-060, 149 N.M. 789, 255 P.3d 367.\n\nWhere the residents of a community filed a mass-tort lawsuit against plaintiff for personal injuries and property damage suffered by the residents as a result of their exposure to toxic chemicals emanating from plaintiff's chemical plant; after the complaint was filed, the community's attorney held a press conference; one of the community residents spoke about the medical issues faced by the resident's children and the attorney for the community stated that the underground water had been contaminated; the statement of the resident was an explanation of the damages portion of the complaint as it related to the children; and the statement by the attorney repeated the allegations of the complaint, the absolute privilege doctrine applied to both statements.Helena Chem. Co. v. Uribe, 2012-NMSC-021, 281 P.3d 237,rev'g2011-NMCA-060, 149 N.M. 789, 255 P.3d 367.\n\nAbsolute-privilege defense applies to statements to the press during litigation.— Statements made by litigants or their attorneys to the press after a lawsuit has been filed are absolutely privileged if the statements are a repetition or an explanation of the allegations in the pleadings.Helena Chem. Co. v. Uribe, 2012-NMSC-021, 281 P.3d 237,rev'g2011-NMCA-060, 149 N.M. 789, 255 P.3d 367.\n\nWhere the residents of a community filed a mass-tort lawsuit against plaintiff for personal injuries and property damage suffered by the residents as a result of their exposure to toxic chemicals emanating from plaintiff's chemical plant; after the complaint was filed, the community's attorney held a press conference; one of the community residents spoke about the medical issues faced by the resident's children and the attorney for the community stated that the underground water had been contaminated; the statement of the resident was an explanation of the damages portion of the complaint as it related to the children; and the statement by the attorney repeated the allegations of the complaint, the absolute privilege doctrine applied to both statements.Helena Chem. Co. v.

As part of the absolute-privilege analysis, the court will consider the extent to which the recipient of the statement had an interest in the judicial proceeding. When the statement precedes litigation of the judicial proceeding, the privilege is available only if the proceeding in question is contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration at the time the statement is made.Helena Chem. Co. v. Uribe, 2011-NMCA-060, 149 N.M. 789, 255 P.3d 367,rev'd, 2012-NMSC-021, 281 P.3d 237\n\nAbsolute-privilege defense does not apply to statements to news reporters.— Statements made to news media recipients who are wholly unrelated to and have no interest in a judicial proceeding are not protected by absolute privilege.Helena Chem. Co. v. Uribe, 2011-NMCA-060, 149 N.M. 789, 255 P.3d 367,rev'd, 2012-NMSC-021, 281 P.3d 237.\n\nWhere community residents held a public meeting to discuss litigation against plaintiff for a toxic tort and a press conference was held after the toxic tort action was filed; news reporters were invited and attended both the public meeting and the new conference; and an attorney who represented the plaintiffs in the toxic tort action and a plaintiff to the toxic tort action made defamatory statements about plaintiff at the public meeting and at the new conference, the defamatory statements were not entitled to absolute-privilege protection, because the statements were made to news reporters who had been invited to hear the statements but who had no relation to or interest in the judicial proceeding.Helena Chem. Co. v. Uribe, 2011-NMCA-060, 149 N.M. 789, 255 P.3d 367,rev'd, 2012-NMSC-021, 281 P.3d 237.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Defamation in New Mexico,\" see 14 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. Any action seeking money damages against a person for conduct or speech undertaken or made in connection with a public hearing or public meeting in a quasi-judicial proceeding before a tribunal or decision-making body of any political subdivision of the state is subject to a special motion to dismiss, motion for judgment on the pleadings, or motion for summary judgment that shall be considered by the court on a priority or expedited basis to ensure the early consideration of the issues raised by the motion and to prevent the unnecessary expense of litigation.\n\nB. If the rights afforded by this section are raised as an affirmative defense and if a court grants a motion to dismiss, a motion for judgment on the pleadings or a motion for summary judgment filed within ninety days of the filing of the moving party's answer, the court shall award reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred by the moving party in defending the action. If the court finds that a special motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment is frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney fees to the party prevailing on the motion.\n\nC. Any party shall have the right to an expedited appeal from a trial court order on the special motions described in Subsection B of this section or from a trial court's failure to rule on the motion on an expedited basis.\n\nD. As used in this section, a \"public meeting in a quasi-judicial proceeding\" means and includes any meeting established and held by a state or local governmental entity, including without limitations, meetings or presentations before state, city, town or village councils, planning commissions, review boards or commissions.\n\nE. Nothing in this section limits or prohibits the exercise of a right or remedy of a party granted pursuant to another constitutional, statutory, common law or administrative provision, including civil actions for defamation or malicious abuse of process.\n\nF. If any provision of this section or the application of any provision of this section to a person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this section that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this section are severable.\n\nHistory:Laws 2001, ch. 218, § 2.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2001, ch. 218 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 23, was effective June 15, 2001, 90 days after adjournment of the legislature.\n\nJurisdiction when there are pending counter-claims in district court.— Where respondent, a Taos school board member, brought a malicious abuse of process claim against petitioners, eighteen members of an unincorporated citizens' association who sought to remove respondent from office, and where the district court granted petitioners' motions to dismiss without addressing certain counterclaims, the appellate court had jurisdiction over all parties under the Anti-SLAPP statute because the overall purpose of the Anti-SLAPP statute would be thwarted by piecemeal litigation if some petitioners were excluded from the appeal, and 38-2-9.1(C) NMSA 1978 allows any party to bring an interlocutory appeal from a trial court order on the special motions brought pursuant to the Anti-SLAPP statute.Cordova v. Cline, 2017-NMSC-020,rev'g2013-NMCA-083, 308 P.3d 975.\n\nExpedited appellate jurisdiction applies to speech-based defenses only.— The legislature enacted the Anti-SLAPP statute with the policy goal of protecting its citizens from lawsuits in retaliation for exercising their right to petition and to participate in quasi-judicial proceedings. The language of subsections A, B, and C reflects the legislature's intent that the procedural protections of the Anti-SLAPP statute apply when a defendant has invoked speech-based defenses for speech or action connected to a quasi-judicial proceeding or public hearing, and therefore the legislature's grant of expedited appellate jurisdiction under subsection C applies to speech-based defenses raised and not to any other affirmative defense.Valenzuela v. My Way Holdings, LLC, 2024-NMCA-009.\n\nAnti-SLAPP statute applied where defendants' conduct was in connection with a quasi-judicial proceeding.— Where the New Mexico racing commission (NMRC) board of stewards suspended plaintiff's racehorse jockey license for five years and imposed a $5,000 fine for using a prohibited electrical device at the Sunland Park racetrack, and where, on appeal to an administrative hearing officer (AHO) under the NMRC, the AHO reversed the board of stewards' decision and dismissed the disciplinary action, citing a lack of physical evidence purported to be in plaintiff's possession as well as inconsistent testimony from defendants, and finding that the board of stewards failed to meet its burden of proof to show by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff possessed a prohibited electrical device, and where plaintiff sued defendants for negligent misrepresentation, fraud, negligence, civil conspiracy, tortious interference with contract, prima facie tort, spoliation, and malicious abuse of process, and where defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's claims via special motion under the Anti-SLAPP statute, arguing that their participation and testimony at plaintiff's disciplinary hearings was protected speech under theNoerr-Penningtondoctrine, the district court erred in determining that the Anti-SLAPP statute did not apply, because plaintiff's complaint sought money damages for defendant's alleged negligent or fraudulent reporting to a public agency and their subsequent testimony and presentation of evidence to a quasi-judicial tribunal and the disciplinary proceedings were quasi-judicial in nature because they determined whether plaintiff's license should be revoked after a presentation of evidence, and therefore defendants' conduct was \"in connection with\" a quasi-judicial proceeding and protected by § 38-2-9.1 NMSA 1978.Valenzuela v. My Way Holdings, LLC, 2024-NMCA-009.\n\nAnalytical framework for claim under theNoerr-Penningtondoctrine.— To be entitled to first amendment protection under theNoerr-Penningtondoctrine, the activity must be genuine and not a mere sham. To constitute a sham, the petitioning activities must be objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits, and if the petitioning activities are objectively baseless, the reviewing court must determine whether the subjective motivation underlying the challenged conduct was improper.Valenzuela v. My Way Holdings, LLC, 2024-NMCA-009.\n\nIncident report to New Mexico racing commission was objectively baseless, without sufficient factual or legal support, and was filed with improper motivations.— Where the New Mexico racing commission (NMRC) board of stewards suspended plaintiff's racehorse jockey license for five years and imposed a $5,000 fine for using a prohibited electrical device at the Sunland Park racetrack, and where, on appeal to an administrative hearing officer (AHO) under the NMRC, the AHO reversed the board of stewards' decision and dismissed the disciplinary action, citing a lack of physical evidence purported to be in plaintiff's possession as well as inconsistent testimony from defendants, and finding that the board of stewards failed to meet its burden of proof to show by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff possessed a prohibited electrical device, and where plaintiff sued defendants for negligent misrepresentation, fraud, negligence, civil conspiracy, tortious interference with contract, prima facie tort, spoliation, and malicious abuse of process, and where defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's claims via special motion under the Anti-SLAPP statute, arguing that their participation and testimony at plaintiff's disciplinary hearings was protected speech under theNoerr-Penningtondoctrine, the district court did not err in denying defendants' special motion to dismiss, because defendants had insufficient legal or factual support to file an incident report against plaintiff to the NMRC or testify to the same facts.Valenzuela v. My Way Holdings, LLC, 2024-NMCA-009.\n\nApplication to recall petitions.— The anti-SLAPP statute [38-2-9.1 NMSA 1978] does not apply to a sufficiency hearing before a district court to determine the sufficiency of the allegations in a recall petition pursuant to Section 22-7-9.1 NMSA 1978, because a sufficiency hearing before the district court is a judicial proceeding, not a public meeting or a quasi-judicial proceeding as defined in the anti-SLAPP statute.Cordova v. Cline, 2013-NMCA-083, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-007.\n\nWhere defendants filed a petition with the county clerk to recall plaintiff who was a member and officer of a municipal school board; the county clerk filed an application for a district court hearing on the sufficiency of the recall allegations pursuant to Section 22-7-9.1 NMSA 1978; at the hearing, before the district court determined the sufficiency of the petition, defendants dismissed the petition; plaintiff filed suit against defendants for damages; and the district court dismissed plaintiff's complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute [38-2-9.1 NMSA 1978], the district court improperly dismissed plaintiff's suit because the anti-SLAPP statute did not apply to a judicial proceeding to determine the sufficiency of the recall petition.Cordova v. Cline, 2013-NMCA-083, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-007.\n\nPlaintiff entitled to expedited appeal following district court's denial of special motion.— Where plaintiff filed an action in district court against defendants, plaintiff's former employer, for malicious abuse of process and defamation, in which she alleged that defendants filed meritless claims against her in retaliation for her submission of sworn declarations to the United States Department of Commerce alleging that defendant was not representing the best interests of certain clients, and where defendants filed several counterclaims, and where plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss (the special motion) these counterclaims under the Anti-SLAPP statute arguing they were made in retaliation for her declarations to the Department of Commerce, and where the district court denied plaintiff's special motion, concluding that the Anti-SLAPP statute was inapplicable because her alleged speech was not directed to a state or local government but to a federal agency, and where, on appeal to the New Mexico Court of Appeals, defendant challenged the court of appeals jurisdiction, arguing that the Anti-SLAPP provision authorizing immediate appeal does not apply, the court of appeals had jurisdiction to review the district court's denial of plaintiff's special motion because Subsection C of this section permits any party to one of the special motions described in Subsection B to appeal from a trial court order on those motions. Moreover, the plain language of Subsection C allowing for an expedited appeal does not distinguish between decisions on the merits of the claims raised in the special motion or decisions on the applicability of the Anti-SLAPP statute, suggesting that both types of decisions are entitled to an expedited appeal.Ferebee v. Hume, 2021-NMCA-012.\n\nThe district court did not err in denying plaintiff's special motion.— Where plaintiff filed an action in district court against defendants, plaintiff's former employer, for malicious abuse of process and defamation, in which she alleged that defendants filed meritless claims against her in retaliation for her submission of sworn declarations to the United States Department of Commerce alleging that defendant was not representing the best interests of certain clients, and where defendants filed several counterclaims, and where plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss (the special motion) these counterclaims under the Anti-SLAPP statute arguing they were made in retaliation for her declarations to the Department of Commerce, and where the district court denied plaintiff's special motion, concluding that the Anti-SLAPP statute was inapplicable because her alleged speech was not directed to a state or local government but to a federal agency, the district court did not err in denying the motion, because the Anti-SLAPP statute does not include within its protections conduct or speech undertaken or made in connection with a public hearing or public meeting in a quasi-judicial proceeding before a tribunal or decision-making body of the federal government.Ferebee v. Hume, 2021-NMCA-012.\n\nAttorney fees awarded under the anti-SLAPP statute are sanctions.— The legislature intended the provision authorizing an award of attorney fees in § 38-2-9.1(B) NMSA 1978, to be a sanction, and not a mechanism for compensating or awarding damages.Cordova v. Cline, 2021-NMCA-022.\n\nAward of attorney fees apply to all stages of litigation, including appellate work.— Where plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that when defendants signed a petition and actively supported plaintiff's recall from the Taos school board, such acts constituted malicious abuse of process, civil conspiracy, and prima facie tort, and where defendants filed special motions to dismiss pursuant to § 38-2-9.1 NMSA 1978, alleging that plaintiff's complaint infringed on defendants' first amendment rights, and where the district court granted defendants' special motions to dismiss, finding that defendants' support of plaintiff's recall from the Taos school board invoked the substantive protection of the first amendment and the procedural and remedial provisions of the anti-SLAPP statute, and where the New Mexico supreme court upheld the dismissal and held that the defendants were statutorily entitled to an award of attorney fees, and where, on remand, the district court granted attorney fees only for work completed while the case was pending in the district court, the district court erred in denying defendants' request for attorney fees for the work done on appeal, because the plain language of the anti-SLAPP statute requires attorney fees to be awarded to a defendant who prevails on any of the special motions provided by the statute, and such an award applies to all stages of litigation reasonably related to the defense of the action, whether at the trial level or on appeal.Cordova v. Cline, 2021-NMCA-022.\n\nPrevailing party not entitled to prejudgment interest on an award of attorney fees.— Where plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that when defendants signed a petition and actively supported plaintiff's recall from the Taos school board, such acts constituted malicious abuse of process, civil conspiracy, and prima facie tort, and where defendants filed special motions to dismiss pursuant to § 38-2-9.1 NMSA 1978, alleging that plaintiff's complaint infringed on defendants' first amendment rights, and where the district court granted defendants' special motions to dismiss and granted defendants' request for attorney fees, finding that defendants' support of plaintiff's recall from the Taos school board invoked the substantive protection of the first amendment and the procedural and remedial provisions of the anti-SLAPP statute, the district court did not err in denying defendants' request for prejudgment interest on their award of attorney fees, because although § 56-8-4(B)(1) NMSA 1978 provides the district court with discretion to award prejudgment interest on damages, the attorney fees awarded under the anti-SLAPP statute are sanctions and not a compensatory mechanism for damages.Cordova v. Cline, 2021-NMCA-022.\n\nDefendants' conduct or speech does not fall within the Anti-SLAPP statute's protections.— Where plaintiff, a candidate for elected office, sued defendants for defamation, declaratory relief, and punitive damages after defendants published and distributed two mailers discussing child abuse that allegedly occurred on the youth ranch operated by plaintiff, and where defendants filed a special motion to dismiss plaintiff's defamation claims under the Anti-SLAPP statute, arguing that the statute protects conduct or speech made during political campaigns, and where the district court denied defendants' special motion, ruling that the statements at issue could qualify as defamatory and that the claims arising from those statements should therefore not be dismissed, defendants' appeal was dismissed as premature, because defendants' statements were not made in connection with a public hearing or public meeting as required by this section. Defendants' speech does not fall within the Anti-SLAPP statute's protections because it was not engaged in for the purpose of petitioning or participating in proceedings before a local or state governmental tribunal.Chandler v. Advance N.M. Now PAC, 2021-NMCA-017, cert. denied.\n\nAnti-SLAPP statute inapplicable in federal diversity action.— Where a lessee of geothermal mineral rights brought an action in federal court alleging that the owner of a portion of surface estate breached the parties' joint facility operating agreement by objecting to their state permit applications, and where defendants filed a special motion to dismiss pursuant to 38-2-9.1 NMSA 1978, New Mexico's legislative enactment aimed at thwarting \"strategic litigation against public participation\" (SLAPP), asserting that New Mexico's anti-SLAPP statute is a substantive state law designed to protect the defendants from having to litigate meritless claims aimed at chilling first amendment expression, the district court did not err in denying defendants special motion, because New Mexico's anti-SLAPP statute is a procedural mechanism designed to expedite the disposal of frivolous lawsuits aimed at threatening free speech rights, and thus does not apply in federal courts as a substantive right or remedy.Los Lobos Renewable Power, LLC v. Americulture, Inc., 885 F.3d 659 (10th Cir. 2018).\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment , \"Resolving Land-use Disputes by Intimidation: SLAPP Suits in New Mexico,\" see 32 N.M.L. Rev. 217 (2002).",

      "text": "The legislature declares that it is the public policy of New Mexico to protect the rights of its citizens to participate in quasi-judicial proceedings before local and state governmental tribunals. Baseless civil lawsuits seeking or claiming millions of dollars have been filed against persons for exercising their right to petition and to participate in quasi-judicial proceedings before governmental tribunals. Such lawsuits can be an abuse of the legal process and can impose an undue financial burden on those having to respond to and defend such lawsuits and may chill and punish participation in public affairs and the institutions of democratic government. These lawsuits should be subject to prompt dismissal or judgment to prevent the abuse of the legal process and avoid the burden imposed by such baseless lawsuits.\n\nHistory:Laws 2001, ch. 218, § 1.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2001, ch. 218 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 23, was effective June 15, 2001, 90 days after adjournment of the legislature.\n\nProtections when exercising the right to petition.— Where respondent, a Taos school board member, brought a malicious abuse of process claim against petitioners, eighteen members of an unincorporated citizens' association who sought to remove respondent from office, the district court properly granted petitioners' motion to dismiss, because petitioners who pursue the recall of a local school board member under the Local School Board Member Recall Act, 22-7-1 to 22-7-14 NMSA 1978, are entitled to the procedural protections of the New Mexico statute prohibiting strategic litigations against public participation (Anti-SLAPP statute, 38-2-9.1 NMSA 1978), and are entitled to immunity under theNoerr-Penningtondoctrine when they exercise their first amendment right to petition.Cordova v. Cline, 2017-NMSC-020,rev'g2013-NMCA-083, 308 P.3d 975.\n\nAnti-SLAPP statute inapplicable in federal diversity action.— Where a lessee of geothermal mineral rights brought an action in federal court alleging that the owner of a portion of surface estate breached the parties' joint facility operating agreement by objecting to their state permit applications, and where defendants filed a special motion to dismiss pursuant to 38-2-9.1 NMSA 1978, New Mexico's legislative enactment aimed at thwarting \"strategic litigation against public participation\" (SLAPP), asserting that New Mexico's anti-SLAPP statute is a substantive state law designed to protect the defendants from having to litigate meritless claims aimed at chilling first amendment expression, the district court did not err in denying defendants special motion, because New Mexico's anti-SLAPP statute is a procedural mechanism designed to expedite the disposal of frivolous lawsuits aimed at threatening free speech rights, and thus does not apply in federal courts as a substantive right or remedy.Los Lobos Renewable Power, LLC v. Americulture, Inc., 885 F.3d 659 (10th Cir. 2018).\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Resolving Land-use Disputes by Intimidation: SLAPP Suits in New Mexico,\" see 32 N.M.L. Rev. 217 (2002).",
