      "text": "A. A person who is at least eighteen years of age, a United States citizen, a resident of New Mexico residing in the county for which a jury may be convened is eligible and may be summoned for service as a juror by the courts, unless the person is incapable of rendering jury service because of:\n\n(1) physical or mental illness or infirmity; or\n\n(2) undue or extreme physical or financial hardship.\n\nB. A person who was convicted of a felony and who meets all other requirements for eligibility may be summoned for jury service if the person has successfully completed all conditions of the sentence imposed for the felony, including conditions for probation or parole.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 19-1-1, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 222, § 1; 1991, ch. 71, § 1; 2005, ch. 107, § 4; 2006, ch. 101, § 1.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1969, ch. 222, § 17, repealed 19-1-1 to 19-1-16, 1953 Comp., relating to the drawing and empaneling of jurors, and enacted 38-5-1, 38-5-3 and 38-5-4 to 38-5-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nCross references.— For constitutional right to jury trial,seeN.M. Const., art. II, § 12.\n\nFor jury trials in magistrate courts,see35-8-1 to 35-8-5 NMSA 1978 and Rule 2-601 NMRA.\n\nThe 2006 amendment,effective May 17, 2006, added Subsection B to provide a person convicted of a felony may serve on a jury if the person has completed the sentenced probation and parole.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective July 1, 2005, deleted the disqualification of eligibility for jury service because of conviction of a felony; and added Subsection B to provide that a person is eligible for jury service unless the person is incapable of rendering jury service because of undue or extreme physical or financial hardship.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective April 1, 1991, rewrote the section which read \"Any person who is a qualified elector is eligible and may be summoned for service as a juror by the district courts unless such person is incapable because of physical or mental illness or infirmity to render jury service.\"\n\nDuty to protect non-English-speaking juror's right to participate in jury service.— Judges and attorneys have responsibilities in protecting a non-English-speaking juror's constitutional right under Article VII, Section 3 of the New Mexico Constitution to participate in jury service. The appellate record must demonstrate that a trial judge has made every reasonable effort to provide interpreters for non-English-speaking jurors; defense attorneys must raise the unconstitutionality of proposed dismissals of jurors for lack of fluency in English; and prosecutors representing the state must protect the rights of all non-English-speaking New Mexicans to serve on juries, both because it is their duty to do so and because an otherwise unnecessary reversal and retrial may well be the consequence of denying those rights.State v. Samora, 2013-NMSC-038.\n\nConstitutional right to sit upon juries.— Where, at the beginning of jury selection, the trial court asked a Spanish-speaking prospective juror, who had difficulty understanding the English language, if the juror understood English well enough to proceed with jury selection without the aid of an interpreter; the juror stated that the juror had been able to follow the discussions to that point; the trial court did not make an effort to find an interpreter for the juror; at the conclusion of voir dire, the juror admitted that the juror had not been able to understand a large part of the voir dire; the trial court dismissed the juror; defendant objected on the ground that the juror had understood English well enough to serve without an interpreter during voir dire, and there was no evidence that the jury was unfair or impartial and the evidence of defendant's guilt was substantial, the dismissal of the juror violated Article VII, Section 3 of the New Mexico Constitution, but the error was not fundamental error requiring reversal of defendant's convictions.State v. Samora, 2013-NMSC-038.\n\nPresence of defendant is not requiredduring the jury culling process in which the judge or designee disqualifies or exempts prospective jurors pursuant to the statutory exemptions contained in this section and 38-5-11 NMSA 1978.State v. Sanders, 2000-NMSC-032, 129 N.M. 728, 13 P.3d 460.\n\nDefendant's presence is not required during discussion of jury questionnaires which is part of the jury culling process.— In a murder trial, where defendant's counsel, without defendant's presence, and counsel for the state conferenced with the district court judge to discuss jury questionnaires, the process employed by the district court was part of the culling process at which defendant had no fundamental right to be present because culling is basically an administrative process occurring outside the presence of the jurors during which defendant can provide no special insight into the removal of jurors from the pool who are disqualified or excused on statutory grounds, unlike the process of challenging potential jurors where the defendant may be able to discern some bias or prejudice.State v. Astorga, 2016-NMCA-015, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-012.\n\nQualification of grand juror as elector.— Grand juror did not have to be a properly registered voter to be a qualified elector, for purposes of sitting on the grand jury.State v. Chama Land & Cattle Co., 1990-NMCA-129, 111 N.M. 317, 805 P.2d 86, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 262, 804 P.2d 1081.\n\nA juror has only to meet the requirements of N.M. Const., art. VII, § 1 to be a qualified elector under this section, and therefore to be qualified to serve as a grand juror.State v. Chama Land & Cattle Co., 1990-NMCA-129, 111 N.M. 317, 805 P.2d 86, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 262, 804 P.2d 1081.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Juries - New Trial - Discovery of Juror's Disqualification or False Answer on Voir Dire as Ground for New Trial,\" see 7 Nat.

      "text": "A. A person who has served as a member of a petit jury panel or a grand jury in either state or federal courts within the preceding thirty-six months shall be exempt from sitting or serving as a juror in a court of this state when the person requests to be exempted from service by reason of the exemption granted by this subsection.\n\nB. A person who is seventy-five years of age or older who requests exemption from jury service with a local court shall be permanently exempt from jury service.\n\nC. A person may be excused from jury service at the discretion of the judge or the judge's designee, with or without the person's personal attendance upon the court, if:\n\n(1) jury service would cause undue or extreme physical or financial hardship to the prospective juror or to a person under the prospective juror's care or supervision;\n\n(2) the person has an emergency that renders the person unable to perform jury service; or\n\n(3) the person presents other satisfactory evidence to the judge or the judge's designee.\n\nD. A person requesting an exemption or an excuse from jury service shall take all necessary action to obtain a ruling on the request no later than the date on which the person is scheduled to appear for jury duty.\n\nE. The judge, in the judge's discretion, upon granting any excuse, may disallow the fees and mileage of the person excused.\n\nF. The service upon a jury of a person disqualified shall, of itself, not vitiate any indictment found or any verdict rendered by that jury, unless actual injury to the person complaining of the injury is shown.\n\nG. As used in this section and Section 38-5-1 NMSA 1978, \"undue or extreme physical or financial hardship\":\n\n(1) means circumstances in which a person would:\n\n(a) be required to abandon another person under the person's care or supervision due to the extreme difficulty of obtaining an appropriate substitute caregiver during the period of jury service;\n\n(b) incur costs that would have a substantial adverse impact on the payment of necessary daily living expenses of the person or the person's dependent; or\n\n(c) suffer physical hardship that would result in illness or disease; and\n\n(2) does not exist solely because a prospective juror will be absent from employment.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 19-1-2, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 150, § 1; 1979, ch. 173, § 1; 2005, ch. 107, § 5; 2009, ch. 26, § 1; 2021, ch. 101, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For mileage and compensation for jurors,see38-5-15 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor exemption from jury service of state guard members,see20-5-15 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective June 18, 2021, allowed persons seventy-five years of age or older to be exempted from jury service without requiring an affidavit; and in Subsection B, after \"seventy-five years of age or older who\", deleted \"files an affidavit requesting an\" and added \"requests\".\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective June 19, 2009, added Subsection B.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective July 1, 2005, added Subsections B(1) through (3) to provide that a person may be excused from jury service at the discretion of the judge or the judge's designee because of physical or financial hardship, an emergency or other factors satisfactory to the judge or the judge's designee; added Subsection C to require a person who requests an exemption or excuse from jury service to obtain a ruling not later than the scheduled appearance date; and added Subsection F to define \"undue or extreme physical or financial hardship\" for this section and Section 38-5-1 NMSA 1978.\n\n\"Disqualified\" juror.— A \"disqualified\" juror is one who is the opposite of, or contrary of, a qualified juror.State v. Chama Land & Cattle Co., 1990-NMCA-129, 111 N.M. 317, 805 P.2d 86, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 262, 804 P.2d 1081.\n\nThere is no substantive difference between an unqualified juror and a disqualified juror. Neither should be on the grand jury.State v. Chama Land & Cattle Co., 1990-NMCA-129, 111 N.M. 317, 805 P.2d 86, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 262, 804 P.2d 1081.\n\nApplicability of section.— This section applies to a juror never qualified as well as to a juror who was once qualified but is not now qualified.State v. Chama Land & Cattle Co., 1990-NMCA-129, 111 N.M. 317, 805 P.2d 86, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 262, 804 P.2d 1081.\n\nPresence of grand juror not disruptive.— There is nothing inherently disruptive about the presence of a grand juror who had no preconceived interest in the way the witnesses testified.State v. Chama Land & Cattle Co., 1990-NMCA-129, 111 N.M. 317, 805 P.2d 86, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 262, 804 P.2d 1081.\n\nShowing of prejudice required.— A defendant must show prejudice resulting from an unqualified juror's presence on the grand jury before the court of appeals will set aside an indictment.State v. Chama Land & Cattle Co., 1990-NMCA-129, 111 N.M. 317, 805 P.2d 86, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 262, 804 P.2d 1081.\n\nNo abuse of court's discretion.— Where the trial court excused one prospective juror because he had been convicted of a felony in 1958, the court explaining that it did not know whether the person excused was eligible to serve as a juror and did not want any questions of eligibility to arise later, and the defendant asserted this was error, but did not explain how excusing this person was an abuse of the trial court's discretion, then, under these circumstances, there was no abuse of the court's discretion.State v. Padilla, 1978-NMCA-020, 91 N.M. 451, 575 P.2d 960.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Juries - New Trial - Discovery of Juror's Disqualification or False Answer on Voir Dire as Ground for New Trial,\" see 7 Nat.

The secretary of state shall preserve and make available to the department of information technology, by electronic media, a database of New Mexico registered voters, by county, which shall be updated every six months. The director of the motor vehicle division of the taxation and revenue department shall make available by electronic media to the department of information technology a database of driver's license holders in each county, which shall be updated every six months. The secretary of taxation and revenue shall make available to the department of information technology, by electronic media, a database of New Mexico personal income tax filers by county, which shall be updated every six months. The updates shall occur in June and December.\n\nB. The department of information technology shall program the merger of the registered voter, driver's license and personal income tax filer databases from each county to form a master jury database and write a computer program so that a random selection of jurors can be made. A discrimination shall not be exercised except for the elimination of persons who are not eligible for jury service. The administrative office of the courts shall provide specifications for the merging of the registered voter, driver's license and personal income tax filer databases to form the master jury database. The master jury database shall be the database that produces the random jury list for the selection of petit or grand jurors for the state courts.\n\nC. The secretary of veterans' services and the adjutant general of the department of military affairs shall make available, by electronic media, to the administrative office of the courts a database of service members who were killed or missing in action during military service, which shall be updated every six months. The administrative office of the courts shall remove the names of service members who were killed or missing in action during military service from the master jury database that produces the random jury list for the state courts.\n\nD. The court shall, by order, designate the number of potential jurors to be selected and the date on which the jurors are to report for empaneling. Within fifteen days after receipt of a copy of the order, the administrative office of the courts shall provide the random jury list to the court. The department of information technology shall print the random jury list and jury summons mailer forms within ten days after receiving the request from the administrative office of the courts. Upon issuance of the order, the department of information technology shall draw from the most current registered voter, driver's license and personal income tax filer databases to create the random jury list.\n\nE. The department of information technology may transfer the master jury database to a court that has compatible equipment to accept such a transfer. The court accepting the master jury database shall transfer the information to a programmed computer used for the random selection of petit or grand jurors.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 38-5-3, enacted by Laws 1991, ch. 71, § 2; 2005, ch. 107, § 6; 2007, ch. 290, § 25; 2009, ch. 157, § 1; 2011, ch. 26, § 1.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1991, ch. 71, § 2 repealed former 38-5-3 NMSA 1978, as enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 222, § 3, relating to pollbooks as the source for juror selection, and enacted a new section, effective April 1, 1991.\n\nThe 2011 amendment,effective June 17, 2011, required the administrative office of the courts to remove the names of service members who are killed or missing in action during military service from the master jury database.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective June 19, 2009, in Subsection A, in the second, third and fourth sentences, after \"which shall be updated\", deleted \"monthly\" and added \"every six months\", and added the last sentence.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective July 1, 2007, changed the name of the information systems division of the general services department to the department of technology information.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective July 1, 2005, provided in Subsection A that the secretary of the taxation and revenue shall make available to the information systems division of the general services department a database of personal income tax filers by county; and in Subsection B, provided that the division shall merge the registered voter, driver's license and personal income tax filer databases in each county to form a master jury data base.\n\nTime allowed to place names of newly enfranchised persons on jury lists.— When a new group is qualified to sit as jurors, a period of time will be allowed for their names to begin to appear on the jury lists.State v. Barnett, 1973-NMCA-098, 85 N.M. 404, 512 P.2d 977.\n\nPossible two-year period which could elapse under this section before the names of newly enfranchised individuals begin to appear on jury lists is not so long as to deny defendant his right to due process.State v. Barnett, 1973-NMCA-098, 85 N.M. 404, 512 P.2d 977.\n\nFailure to include in pollbooks newly enfranchised persons prior to the next general electionwas not a denial of due process.State v. Barnett, 1973-NMCA-098, 85 N.M. 404, 512 P.2d 977.\n\nWhere the jury array did not include members of the then recently enfranchised class of persons between the ages of 18 and 21 years, defendant was not deprived of due process.State v. Barnett, 1973-NMCA-098, 85 N.M. 404, 512 P.2d 977.\n\nSubsequent expansion to include nonvoters with driver's licenses.— The legislature's intent to wait until after the 1990 general election to enlarge the jury pool to include nonvoting citizens with driver's licenses was not inconsistent with defendant's constitutional rights.State v. Gonzales, 1991-NMSC-075, 112 N.M. 544, 817 P.2d 1186.\n\nDefendant was not denied her right to a venire composed of voter registration and driver's license records as required by this section, where her trial took place before the expanded pool took effect.State v. Neely, 1991-NMSC-087, 112 N.M. 702, 819 P.2d 249.\n\nDefendant was not denied his right to a venire composed from voter registration and driver's license records, since the plain language of this section required the jury pool to be expanded 90 days after the next general election and defendant's trial took place before the expanded pool took effect.State v. Chamberlain, 1991-NMSC-094, 112 N.M. 723, 819 P.2d 673.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —47 Am.

If the motion is sustained, then the trial will be stayed until a jury panel has been selected and qualified in accordance with law. Such a challenge is waived if not raised before the trial jury panel has been sworn and selection of the trial jury commenced.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 19-1-16, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 222, § 16.\n\nCross references.— For challenges to jurors in civil and criminal cases generally,see38-5-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor challenges of jurors in civil cases,seeRule 1-038E NMRA.\n\nFor challenges of jurors in criminal cases,seeRule 5-606 NMRA.\n\nRepresentative cross-section of the community.— In order to show a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement, a defendant must demonstrate that (1) the group alleged to be excluded is a \"distinctive\" group in the community, (2) the group's representation in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community, and (3) this under-representation results from the systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.State v.

Either party may require the jury to be polled, which is done by the court or clerk asking each juror if it is his verdict; if upon such inquiry or polling, more than two of the jurors disagree thereto, the jury must be sent out again, but if no such disagreement be expressed, the verdict is complete and the jury discharged from the case.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp. § 38-5-17, enacted by Laws 1933, ch. 98, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For number of jurors in criminal cases,see38-5-13 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor right to jury trial,seeN.M.
