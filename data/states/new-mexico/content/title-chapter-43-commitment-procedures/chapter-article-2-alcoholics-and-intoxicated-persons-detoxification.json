in Subsection A, defined \"alcohol-impaired person\" and deleted the former definition of \"alcoholic\"; deleted former Subsection B, which defined \"approved private treatment facility\"; deleted former Subsection C, which defined \"approved public treatment facility\"; added a new Subsection B, which defined \"authorized person\"; added a new Subsection C, which defined \"consistent with the least drastic means principle\"; deleted former Subsection E, which defined \"division\" and added a new Subsection E, which defined \"detention center\";
