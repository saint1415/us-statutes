      "text": "A. As used in this section, \"endangered plant species\" means any plant species whose prospects of survival within the state are in jeopardy or are likely, within the foreseeable future, to become jeopardized. Regulations passed by the natural resources department establishing a list of endangered plant species shall include those species listed in the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 or as that act may be amended.\n\nB. The natural resources department shall conduct investigations of all species of plants in the state in order to develop information relating to population, distribution, habitat needs, limiting factors and other biological and ecological data, and to determine conservation measures and requirements necessary for their survival. On the basis of these investigations, the department shall establish a list of endangered plant species.\n\nC. The department shall establish a program necessary for the conservation of listed endangered plant species. That program shall include research, census, law enforcement, habitat maintenance, propagation and transplantation. As used in this section, law enforcement shall be defined to be law enforcement for purposes of enforcement of the prohibition against taking, possession, transportation, exportation from this state, processing, sale or offer for sale or shipment within this state of listed plants or plant materials.\n\nD. The department shall have authority to protect species of plants determined to be endangered by prohibiting the taking, possession, transportation, exportation from this state, processing, sale or offer for sale or shipment within this state of such species. Any person who violates the provisions of this subsection or any regulations issued pursuant to this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined not less than three hundred dollars ($300) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or be imprisoned for a term of not more than one hundred twenty days or both. As used in this section, \"possession\" shall be defined to be possession of listed plants or plant materials for purposes of taking, transportation, exportation from this state, processing, sale or offer for sale or shipment within this state.\n\nE. The department may by permit allow collection otherwise prohibited by this section for scientific purposes or to enhance the propagation or survival of the affected species by transplanting or other means, but such permit shall not authorize any action that would violate federal laws or regulations.\n\nF. The department may enter into agreements with federal agencies, other states, agencies or political subdivisions of the state, or with individuals for administration and management of any program established under this section.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 9-10-10, enacted by Laws 1985, ch. 143, § 1; recompiled as 1978 Comp., § 75-5-1 by Laws 1987, ch. 234, § 82.\n\nRecompilation note.— Laws 1987, ch. 234, § 82, effective July 1, 1987, recompiled former 9-10-10 NMSA 1978 as 75-5-1 NMSA 1978, but, since Laws 1987, Chapter 192 had already enacted Article 5 of Chapter 75, former 9-10-10 NMSA 1978 has been recompiled as 75-6-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nEndangered Species Act of 1973.— The federal Endangered Species Act of 1973, referred to near the end of Subsection A, principally appears as 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.\n\nAm.
