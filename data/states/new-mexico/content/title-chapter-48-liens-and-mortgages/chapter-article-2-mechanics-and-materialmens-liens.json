      "text": "A lien is a charge imposed upon specific property, by which it is made security for the performance of an act.\n\nHistory:Laws 1880, ch. 16, § 1; C.L. 1884, § 1519; C.L. 1897, § 2216; Code 1915, § 3318; C.S. 1929, § 82-201; 1941 Comp., § 63-201; 1953 Comp., § 61-2-1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For oil and gas products lien,see48-9-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor municipal utilities, liens on property,see3-23-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor sewer assessments, liens,see3-26-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor improvement district assessments, liens,see3-33-23 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor municipal liens for taxes and assessments,see3-36-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor refuse collection assessment as municipal lien on realty,see3-48-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor assessment for irrigation of trees and shrubs in municipalities, lien,see3-53-5 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor judgment as lien on real estate,see39-1-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor decree for support of children, lien on real estate,see40-4-15 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor adjudication of water rights, costs of hydrographic survey a lien,see72-4-17 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor county board of horticultural commissioners, lien for expenses,see76-3-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor rodent pest repression, lien on land,see77-15-4, 77-15-5 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe New Mexico Mechanics' Lien Law is constitutional.Gray v. N.M. Pumice Stone Co., 1910-NMSC-036, 15 N.M. 478, 110 P. 603;Genest v. Las Vegas Masonic Bldg. Ass'n, 1902-NMSC-003, 11 N.M. 251, 67 P. 743;Baldridge v. Morgan, 1910-NMSC-003, 15 N.M. 249, 106 P. 342.\n\nLegislative intent.— The object of the Mechanics' Lien Law is to protect those who, by their labor, services, skill or materials furnished, have enhanced the value of the property sought to be charged.Hobbs v. Spiegelberg, 1885-NMSC-014, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 357, 5 P. 529.\n\nConstruction of act.— This act should be construed liberally.Hot Springs Plumbing & Heating Co. v. Wallace, 1933-NMSC-092, 38 N.M. 3, 27 P.2d 984.\n\nLiberal construction.— The right to a lien is purely statutory, and a claimant to such a lien must in the first instance bring himself clearly within the terms of the statute. The statute is strictly construed as to persons entitled to its benefits and as to the procedure necessary to perfect the lien; but when the claimant's right has been clearly established, the law will be liberally interpreted toward accomplishing the purposes of its enactment.Lembke Constr. Co. v. J.D. Coggins Co., 1963-NMSC-109, 72 N.M. 259, 382 P.2d 983.\n\nThe Mechanics' Lien Law, though in derogation of the common law, is remedial in its nature and is to have a liberal construction.Lembke Constr. Co. v. J.D. Coggins Co., 1963-NMSC-109, 72 N.M. 259, 382 P.2d 983.\n\nThe act is in fact remedial in nature and should be liberally construed.Home Plumbing & Contracting Co. v. Pruitt, 1962-NMSC-075, 70 N.M. 182, 372 P.2d 378.\n\nLien statutory, not equitable.— The lien is of statutory, not equitable, origin. It depends wholly upon the existence of certain conditions and the performance by the claimant of a prescribed act. The absence of the conditions or the nonperformance of the act leaves equity powerless. The court's function is not to create a lien. It can only declare and enforce an existing lien.Lembke Constr. Co. v. J.D. Coggins Co., 1963-NMSC-109, 72 N.M. 259, 382 P.2d 983.\n\nThis article applies to mechanics and materialmen.Hobbs v. Morrison Supply Co., 1937-NMSC-060, 41 N.M. 644, 73 P.2d 325.\n\nContract for vendor's lien.— An executory contract for the sale of land, reserving legal title in the vendor until payment, does not create a vendor's lien.Albuquerque Lumber Co. v. Tomei, 1926-NMSC-033, 32 N.M. 5, 250 P. 21.\n\nCalifornia cases followed.— The New Mexico supreme court has consistently followed the pertinent decisions of the California courts in cases in which the mechanics' and materialmen's lien statutes have been involved.Lembke Constr. Co. v. J.D. Coggins Co., 1963-NMSC-109, 72 N.M. 259, 382 P.2d 983.\n\nUnjust enrichment basis for statutory lien.— The Miller Act, § 270(b), Title 40, U.S.C.A. (now 40 U.S.C. § 3133), is not a lien statute, but merely provides a remedy for recovery of monies due for the doing of work or furnishing of materials provided for in the contract mentioned in Subsection (a) of the act; thus, the right of the claimant must relate to the provisions of the construction contract under the Miller Act and similar state statutes. With reference to mechanics' and materialmen's statutes, the rule is that the right relates to the benefit inuring to the property and arises from the equitable principle of unjust enrichment.Lembke Constr. Co. v. J.D. Coggins Co., 1963-NMSC-109, 72 N.M. 259, 382 P.2d 983.\n\nLaw reviews.— For survey of construction law in New Mexico, see 18 N.M.L. Rev. 331 (1988).\n\nAm.

      "number": "48-2-2",
      "heading": "Mechanics and materialmen; lien; labor, equipment and materials furnished; definition of agent of owner.",
      "text": "Every person performing labor upon, providing or hauling equipment, tools or machinery for or furnishing materials to be used in the construction, alteration or repair of any mine, building, wharf, bridge, ditch, flume, tunnel, fence, machinery, railroad, road or aqueduct to create hydraulic power or any other structure, who performs labor in any mine or is a registered surveyor or who surveys real property has a lien upon the same for the work or labor done, for the specific contract or agreed upon charge for the surveying or equipment, tools or machinery hauled or provided or materials furnished by each respectively, whether done, provided, hauled or furnished at the instance of the owner of the building or other improvement or his agent. Every contractor, subcontractor, architect, builder or other person having charge of any mining or of the construction, alteration or repair, either in whole or in part, of any building or other improvement shall be held to be the agent of the owner for the purposes of this section.\n\nHistory:Laws 1880, ch. 16, § 2; C.L. 1884, § 1520; C.L. 1897, § 2217; Code 1915, § 3319; C.S. 1929, § 82-202; 1941 Comp., § 63-202; 1953 Comp., § 61-2-2; Laws 1965, ch. 184, § 1; 1991, ch. 43, § 1; 1993, ch. 252, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For unlicensed contractor not entitled to lien,see60-13-30 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, substituted \"mine\" for both occurrences of \"mining claim\" and made a minor stylistic change.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective April 1, 1991, inserted \"or is a registered surveyor or who surveys real property\" and \"surveying or\" near the middle of the section and made a minor stylistic change.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nNotice.— Sections 48-2-2, 48-2-2.1, 48-2-5 NMSA 1978 indicate that timing and actual or constructive notice not a general public policy favoring materialmen are the principal considerations in determining priority between suppliers and other creditors, at least in the context of private construction projects.Hasse Contracting Co., Inc. v. KBK Fin., Inc., 1999-NMSC-023, 127 N.M. 316, 980 P.2d 641.\n\nLiens not due process violation.— The fact that the statute allowed liens to be asserted in excess of the contract price of the building or improvement was not a restraint upon the liberty of contract or a taking of property without due process of law.Baldridge v. Morgan, 1910-NMSC-003, 15 N.M. 249, 106 P. 342.\n\nThe lien given by this section was founded upon the doing of the work or the furnishing of the material.Weggs v. Kreugel, 1922-NMSC-021, 28 N.M. 24, 205 P. 730.\n\nPurpose of cumulative effect not to nullify other statutes.— The purposes of the declaration of cumulative effect was not to make other statutory provisions applicable to those things covered by the Oil Act itself, but to show that the things for which liens were given by this act were not intended to nullify other lien statutes in favor of mechanics, laborers, clerks and others performing services in the oil industry, and materialmen who might furnish material in the oil or mining industry not covered by the act.Butt v. Vermejo Park Corp., 1976-NMSC-075, 89 N.M. 679, 556 P.2d 835.\n\nSimilar provisions for benefit of suppliers for government construction project.— Sections 13-4-18 and 13-4-19 NMSA 1978 are intended to provide a remedy comparable to a mechanic's lien to materialmen who provide supplies for a state government construction project.State ex rel. W.M. Carroll & Co. v. K.L. House Constr. Co., 1982-NMSC-150, 99 N.M. 186, 656 P.2d 236.\n\nRelation back of subcontractor's lien.— A subcontractor's lien relates back to the date when any construction actually commenced, even though that subcontractor's work commenced after the mortgage was recorded.First Interstate Bank v. Hutchens, 1991-NMSC-086, 112 N.M. 497, 816 P.2d 1119.\n\nWhere a miner mining gypsum and two other providers of labor (not \"subcontractors\" on a construction project) subsequently performed services unrelated to the mining enterprise, the claims of the later workers did not relate back to the date when the miner began his labor.First Interstate Bank v. Hutchens, 1991-NMSC-086, 112 N.M. 497, 816 P.2d 1119.\n\nThird-tier material suppliers in government construction projects are protected under \"Little Miller Act,\"Sections 13-4-18 to 13-4-20 NMSA 1978 (bonds of public contractors).Nichols Corp. v. Bill Stuckman Constr., Inc., 1986-NMSC-077, 105 N.M. 37, 728 P.2d 447.\n\nIdentification of land in claim.— Where lien form claim listed mechanics' claim as against lot upon which minor portion of building was located but statement of charges for work completed correctly described address of building and owners admitted in answer that building was located at the named address, statute requiring that land identified in lien claim be land upon which improvements were made was complied with.Boone v. Smith, 1968-NMSC-172, 79 N.M. 614, 447 P.2d 23.\n\nEffect of invalid lien.— The mere filing of a materialman's lien did not give defendant the right to foreclose the lien, where the lien was invalid from its inception because it was filed after defendant knew that the swimming pool heater he had furnished was not actually used, and it was not a part of the swimming pool.Branch v. Mays, 1976-NMCA-086, 89 N.M. 536, 554 P.2d 1297.\n\nEntitlement to lien.— It was not necessary that the owner be indebted to the contractor to entitle the subcontractor, materialman or laborer to mechanic's lien.Hobbs v. Spiegelberg, 1885-NMSC-014, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 357, 5 P. 529.\n\nCreation of lien.— Contractor, simply by performing labor in a mine, did not have a mechanic's lien made under this section.First Interstate Bank v. Hutchens, 1991-NMSC-086, 112 N.M. 497, 816 P.2d 1119.\n\nAbandonment as affecting lien.— Where a hole drilled for a water well was dry, and was abandoned, the fact of abandonment, if through no fault of driller, did not affect the driller's right to mechanic's lien.Dysart v. Youngblood, 1940-NMSC-032, 44 N.M. 351, 102 P.2d 664.\n\nNonresponsibility notice ineffective.— Owner of land who, himself, orders or contracts for an improvement to be erected thereon cannot escape responsibility for the materials purchased for use in the improvement, and the posting of notice of nonresponsibility under Section 48-2-11 NMSA 1978 in such a case amounts to nothing.Skidmore v. Eby, 1953-NMSC-098, 57 N.M. 669, 262 P.2d 370.\n\nNo quantum meruit enforcement.— Materialmen's lien filed on theory of express contract was extinguished when claimant failed to establish his claim on express contract, and could not be enforced in a subsequent action in quantum meruit.Terry v. Pipkin, 1959-NMSC-049, 66 N.M. 4, 340 P.2d 840.\n\nOil Act lien where express contract.— Under the Mechanics' Act, a lien may be imposed upon the fee owner's interest if he has knowledge of the construction and fails to disclaim responsibility therefor in the manner and within the time therein provided while under the Oil Act (Section 70-4-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.), the fee owner's interest is subject to a lien only if he expressly so contracts. This is an obvious conflict, and it was held that a company which built roads, leveled land, hauled water and provided gravel and load pipe in connection with certain oil and gas exploration and drilling was only entitled to assert a lien under the Oil Act.Butt v. Vermejo Park Corp., 1976-NMSC-075, 89 N.M. 679, 556 P.2d 835.\n\nRealty liens rare.— Generally, mechanic's lien statutes do not allow a lien against the realty for material or labor entering into the construction of trade fixtures or chattels, fixtures or improvements which a tenant will be permitted to remove at the expiration of his term.Porter Lumber Co. v. Wade, 1934-NMSC-042, 38 N.M. 333, 32 P.2d 819.\n\nCalifornia decisions followed.— This section was taken from California and the New Mexico supreme court has consistently followed the California decisions in construing the lien statute.Tabet v. Davenport, 1953-NMSC-076, 57 N.M. 540, 260 P.2d 722.\n\nII. CONSTRUCTION OF STATUTE.\n\nA. LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION.\n\nLiberal construction.— The Mechanic's Lien Law, being remedial in its nature, and equitable in its enforcement, should be liberally construed.Lyons v. Howard, 1911-NMSC-039, 16 N.M. 327, 117 P. 842;Finane v. Las Vegas Hotel & Improvement Co., 1885-NMSC-023, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 411, 5 P. 725,overruled byFord v. Springer Land Ass'n, 1895-NMSC-011, 8 N.M. 37, 41 P. 541,aff'd, 168 U.S. 513, 18 S. Ct. 170, 42 L. Ed. 562 (1897);Genest v. Las Vegas Masonic Bldg. Ass'n, 1902-NMSC-003, 11 N.M. 251, 67 P. 743;Houston Hart Lumber Co. v. Neal, 1911-NMSC-024, 16 N.M. 197, 113 P. 621;Hot Springs Plumbing & Heating Co. v. Wallace, 1933-NMSC-092, 38 N.M. 3, 27 P.2d 984.\n\nDoctrine of liberal construction was invoked to bring within term \"structure\" plaintiffs' dry water well and labor and materials used in drilling it.Dysart v. Youngblood, 1940-NMSC-032, 44 N.M. 351, 102 P.2d 664.\n\nWhile the mechanic's lien statute would be liberally construed, the court would not go beyond the rights claimed.Texas, S.F. & N.R.R. v. Orman, 1886-NMSC-020, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 652, 9 P. 595 (1886).\n\nB. DEFINITION OF TERMS.\n\nDefinitions of terms.— Materials to be used in the construction means materials actually used in the construction, and did not cover a swimming pool heater which was not actually used in, and did not become a part of, a swimming pool.Branch v. Mays, 1976-NMCA-086, 89 N.M. 536, 554 P.2d 1297.\n\nDefinitions.— The words \"construction,\" \"alteration\" and \"repair\" have different signification.Board of Comm'rs v. State, 1939-NMSC-031, 43 N.M. 409, 94 P.2d 515.\n\n\"Mining claim\" meant portion of public mineral lands to which qualified persons could obtain rights of occupancy and possession by certain prescribed methods.Gray v. N.M. Pumice Stone Co., 1910-NMSC-036, 15 N.M. 478, 110 P. 603.\n\n\"Owner\" referred to the person causing the building to be constructed.Albuquerque Lumber Co. v. Montevista Co., 1934-NMSC-086, 39 N.M. 6, 38 P.2d 77;Albuquerque Lumber Co. v. Tomei, 1926-NMSC-033, 32 N.M. 5, 250 P. 21.\n\nThe agent, in case of a mine, was any person having charge of the mine, with power to employ laborers, and such employment subjected their claims to the lien provided by the statute.Post v. Fleming, 1900-NMSC-033, 10 N.M. 476, 62 P. 1087.\n\nTo qualify as a subcontractor, the party must perform some portion of the work for which the owner originally contracted. It is not necessary that the work be done at the construction site, but work must be performed to the contract's plans and specifications, and the work performed must be substantial.Vulcraft v. Midtown Bus. Park, Ltd., 1990-NMSC-095, 110 N.M. 761, 800 P.2d 195.\n\nIII. APPLICATION OF STATUTES.\n\nA. SERVICES INCLUDED.\n\nClaimant's labor included.— Work performed by lien claimant in lime quarry as a laborer, working as a sort of foreman with other laborers, and directing them in their work, working at the lime kiln, gathering up tools, closing lime bins and caring for teams of horses, was work within the terms of the lien statute.Gray v. N.M. Pumice Stone Co., 1910-NMSC-036, 15 N.M. 478, 110 P. 603.\n\nArchitect's plans entitled to lien.— An architect who, under contract with the owner, prepares and furnishes plans for a building which is actually constructed in accordance therewith, is entitled to a lien for his services, even though he does not supervise the construction of such building.Gaastra, Gladding & Johnson v. Bishop's Lodge Co., 1931-NMSC-021, 35 N.M. 396, 299 P. 347.\n\nUnder statute providing liens for \"every person performing labor,\" superintending architect had right to lien not only for his services in superintending work, but also for his plans and specifications in accordance with which building was erected.Johnson v. McClure, 1900-NMSC-036, 10 N.M. 506, 62 P. 983.\n\nB. USE AND FURNISHING OF MATERIALS.\n\nFurnishing use of materials sufficient.— The furnishing of materials to be used in the construction and the putting of them into the building entitled the subcontractor to the lien upon the premises to the extent of the value of such materials, for the statute was general and did not restrict the right of lien to cases when materials were sold and delivered in this territory.Stearns-Roger Mfg. Co. v. Aztec Gold Mining & Milling Co., 1908-NMSC-001, 14 N.M. 300, 93 P. 706;Genest v. Las Vegas Masonic Bldg. Ass'n, 1902-NMSC-003, 11 N.M. 251, 67 P. 743.\n\nUse, consumption of materials required.— This statute has been construed to require both allegation and proof that the materials \"furnished . . . to be used in construction\" were sold to be used on the land against which the lien is claimed and that the materials were used there and became part of the structure.Panhandle Pipe & Steel, Inc. v. Jesko, 1969-NMSC-098, 80 N.M. 457, 457 P.2d 705.\n\nOrdinarily, unless expressly so provided by statute, no lien may be acquired for the value or use of tools, machinery, equipment or appliances furnished or lent for the purposes of facilitating the work, where they remain the property of the contractor and are not consumed in their use, but remain capable of use in other construction or improvement work.Lembke Constr. Co. v. J.D. Coggins Co., 1963-NMSC-109, 72 N.M. 259, 382 P.2d 983.\n\nOne who asserts a lien for materials must not only allege and prove that he sold the materials for use in the particular building, but that they were actually used therein.Tabet v. Davenport, 1953-NMSC-076, 57 N.M. 540, 260 P.2d 722.\n\nLien as to consumed, worthless materials.— Generally a lien may be acquired for materials which, although not incorporated in the building or improvement, are used in the construction and, by their use, are actually or practically consumed, wasted, destroyed or rendered worthless or unfit for further use.Lembke Constr. Co. v. J.D. Coggins Co., 1963-NMSC-109, 72 N.M. 259, 382 P.2d 983.\n\nFurnishing materials required.— The statute provides a lien for \"furnishing materials to be used in the construction\" of houses; there being a failure of proof plaintiff furnished such materials, the judgment correctly dismissed the lien against defendant's property.Blueher Lumber Co. v. Springer, 1967-NMSC-034, 77 N.M. 449, 423 P.2d 878.\n\nWhere there was a failure of proof that the materials itemized on invoices were furnished for use in defendant's house, plaintiff was not entitled to lien against those materials.Blueher Lumber Co. v. Springer, 1967-NMSC-034, 77 N.M. 449, 423 P.2d 878.\n\nFurnishing materials required.— Mechanic's lien did not have priority over a mortgage where, although an architect had performed work prior to the recording of the mortgage, no physical work had commenced upon the site nor had any materials been delivered thereto.Sec. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Commercial Invs., Ltd., 92 Bankr. 488 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1988).\n\nC. PROPERTY SUBJECT TO LIEN.\n\nTest as to \"improvements,\" \"fixtures\".— While this section uses the word \"improvements\" rather than the word \"fixtures,\" it is recognized that the test for determining whether a given article is subject to a lien under the section is whether it is a fixture or a permanent part of the building.Boone v. Smith, 1968-NMSC-172, 79 N.M. 614, 447 P.2d 23.\n\nSupreme court has long recognized three guidelines in determining whether an article used in connection with realty is to be considered a fixture, which are: (1) annexation, (2) adaptation and (3) intention.Boone v. Smith, 1968-NMSC-172, 79 N.M. 614, 447 P.2d 23.\n\nWhere articles are securely attached to building and are used for the purpose for which they were installed, these articles annexed to the building with the owner's knowledge became a part of the building itself.Boone v. Smith, 1968-NMSC-172, 79 N.M. 614, 447 P.2d 23.\n\nIn determining whether articles are fixtures, intent is the chief test and must affirmatively and plainly appear.Boone v. Smith, 1968-NMSC-172, 79 N.M. 614, 447 P.2d 23.\n\nWhere building required installation of electric wiring and heating to be usable and lease provided that improvements made by lessee with consent of lessor would merge and become part of realty, improvements were intended to be fixtures and subject to mechanics' liens.Boone v. Smith, 1968-NMSC-172, 79 N.M. 614, 447 P.2d 23.\n\nWhere by express terms of a lease it is provided that improvements shall not become fixtures, and where the nature of the article is such that it is not to be permanently attached to the land, it probably remains personalty and not subject to a mechanic's lien.Boone v. Smith, 1968-NMSC-172, 79 N.M. 614, 447 P.2d 23.\n\nNo lien on personalty not permanently affixed.— Movable drilling outfit, not designed or intended to be permanently affixed to the land, was not the subject of a mechanic's lien. Albuquerque Foundry & Mach.Works v. Stone, 1930-NMSC-017, 34 N.M. 540, 286 P. 157.\n\nFurnishing and repairing fishing tools and appliances for oil wells, not designed for permanent annexation to the realty, did not give rise to mechanic's lien.Albuquerque Foundry & Mach. Works v. Stone, 1930-NMSC-017, 34 N.M. 540, 286 P. 157.\n\nMachinery repairs.— To authorize a mechanic's lien for the repair of machinery, such repairs had to be in the nature of fixtures, and not small parts of a machine which were constantly wearing out and having to be replaced.Ripley v. Cochiti Gold Mining Co., 1904-NMSC-013, 12 N.M. 186, 76 P. 285.\n\nLien attachable upon unimproved, abandoned property.— A mechanic's or materialman's lien can attach to property even if no improvement occurred due to the owner's abandonment of the project through no fault of the claimant.Cubit Corp. v. Hausler, 1992-NMSC-050, 114 N.M. 602, 845 P.2d 125.\n\nExtent of property subject to lien.— A person who was entitled to a mechanic's lien by reason of material furnished or work done was entitled to a lien on the whole of the building constructed or improved together with so much of the lot or lots on which the building so constructed or improved stands, as might have been necessary for the full use and enjoyment of the property.Mountain Elec. Co. v. Miles, 1899-NMSC-002, 9 N.M. 512, 56 P. 284.\n\nLessees' improvements not included.— Mere fact that bowling alleys, constructed by lessees on leased premises, were necessary to enable the lessees to carry on their business was not sufficient to subject the lessor's property to lien for materials used in the construction of the bowling alleys.Porter Lumber Co. v.

Coco, Inc. v. St. Paul's Methodist Church, 1967-NMSC-138, 78 N.M. 97, 428 P.2d 636.\n\nAgent-superintendent not covered.— The general agent and superintendent of a mine, who attended to all the business, directed its conduct, and was the representative of the company with absolute and plenary power to employ and discharge laborers, was not within the beneficence of this statute, enacted for the security of a class not otherwise able to protect themselves.Boyle v. Mountain Key Mining Co., 1897-NMSC-024, 9 N.M. 237, 50 P. 347.\n\nMaterialman furnishing supplies to middleman.— This section authorizes a materialman furnishing supplies to a middleman that contracted with a general contractor to provide specially fabricated material in accordance with project specifications to assert a lien against the building project, even though the middleman did no work at the construction site.Vulcraft v. Midtown Bus. Park, Ltd., 1990-NMSC-095, 110 N.M. 761, 800 P.2d 195.\n\nIV. PROCEDURAL ASPECTS.\n\nNonresident parties.— An adjudication under New Mexico statutes not purporting to be a personal judgment against a nonresident defendant, service by publication was valid, the proceeding, as to such defendant, being in rem.Genest v. Las Vegas Masonic Bldg. Ass'n, 1902-NMSC-003, 11 N.M. 251, 67 P. 743.\n\nA materialman in Colorado furnishing materials and machinery to a mining company in this state for use in the mine and mill was entitled to a mechanic's lien.Stearns-Roger Mfg. Co. v. Aztec Gold Mining & Milling Co., 1908-NMSC-001, 14 N.M. 300, 93 P. 706.\n\nJudgment void without service.— A judgment of foreclosure of a materialman's lien obtained without service of process upon the owner of the property was as to lien void for want of jurisdiction.Robertson v. Mine & Smelter Supply Co., 1910-NMSC-053, 15 N.M. 606, 110 P. 1037.\n\nAssumpsit not proper procedure.— Joint action in assumpsit, brought by contractor against owner and the latter's grantee, was not proper procedure for enforcing mechanic's lien.Rupe v. N.M. Lumber Ass'n, 1885-NMSC-020, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 393, 5 P. 730;Straus v. Finane & Elston, 1885-NMSC-024, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 398, 5 P. 729.\n\nThe laws of New Mexico do not give subcontractor personal cause of actionagainst owners, only a lien against the land or structure.George M. Morris Constr. Co. v. Four Seasons Motor Inn, Inc., 1977-NMSC-064, 90 N.M. 654, 567 P.2d 965.\n\nNo personal cause of action.— The mere establishment of a lien upon defendants' property did not warrant a personal judgment against them as owners, there being no contractual relation between them and the lienors.Allison v. Schuler, 1934-NMSC-072, 38 N.M. 506, 36 P.2d 519.\n\nBurden on party establishing lien.— To establish a valid materialman's lien, the burden was on defendant to prove that the heater was actually used in, and became a part of, the structure.Branch v. Mays, 1976-NMCA-086, 89 N.M. 536, 554 P.2d 1297.\n\nNo presumption of delivery.— Evidence of delivery is generally as available to materialman as to the owner, and possibly more available to the materialman, since he normally makes the delivery to the contractor, not the owner, and therefore there is generally no presumption of delivery in favor of materialman.Panhandle Pipe & Steel, Inc. v. Jesko, 1969-NMSC-098, 80 N.M. 457, 457 P.2d 705.\n\nNo evidence of delivery.— There was no evidence to show delivery of materials to defendant's lot which would support a lien for the claimed balance of $2,609.84 where payment made by defendant exceeded the total for materials delivered to the lot.Blueher Lumber Co. v. Springer, 1967-NMSC-034, 77 N.M. 449, 423 P.2d 878.\n\nWhere trial court weighed the evidence and found appellant's circumstantial proof to be inconclusive as to the fact of delivery of material by appellant to defendant, if properly sustained defendant's motion to dismiss under Rule 41(b) N.M.R. Civ. P. (now Rule 1-041B NMRA).Panhandle Pipe & Steel, Inc. v. Jesko, 1969-NMSC-098, 80 N.M. 457, 457 P.2d 705.\n\nUse presumed from delivery.— Use of the materials furnished by materialman in the structure, by owner, may be presumed from delivery on the theory that generally the owner is more familiar than the materialman with the disposition of the materials after they are delivered to the property.Panhandle Pipe & Steel, Inc. v. Jesko, 1969-NMSC-098, 80 N.M. 457, 457 P.2d 705.\n\nParol testimony sufficient.— A written contract was not necessary to entitle a materialman to a lien, and it could be shown by parol testimony that the materials were used in the construction and improvement of the property.Stearns-Roger Mfg. Co. v. Aztec Gold Mining & Milling Co., 1908-NMSC-001, 14 N.M. 300, 93 P. 706.\n\nPrivity of contract is not required to give rise to the right to a lien.1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-148.\n\nNo lien against soil conservation district.— The contractor's creditors may not impose a lien of any nature against the soil conservation district for the contractor's debts where the district had directly contracted with the contractor. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-148.\n\nLaw reviews.— For survey of construction law in New Mexico, see 18 N.M.L.

The provisions of Subsections B through D of this section do not apply to claims of liens made on residential property containing four or fewer dwelling units, to claims of liens made by an original contractor or to claims of liens made by mechanics or materialmen who contract directly with the original contractor. For purposes of this section, \"original contractor\" means a contractor that contracts directly with the owner.\n\nB. No lien of a mechanic or a materialman claimed in an amount of more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) may be enforced by action or otherwise unless the lien claimant has given notice in writing of the claimant's right to claim a lien in the event of nonpayment and that notice was given not more than sixty days after initially furnishing work or materials, or both, by either certified mail, return receipt requested, facsimile with acknowledgement or personal delivery to:\n\n(1) the owner or reputed owner of the property upon which the improvements are being constructed; or\n\n(2) the original contractor, if any.\n\nC. If the owner or the original contractor claims lack of notice as a defense to the enforcement of a lien described in Subsection B of this section, the owner or contractor shall show that upon the request of the mechanic or materialman that the owner or contractor furnished to the lien claimant not more than five days after such request was made:\n\n(1) the original contractor's name, address and license number, if there is an original contractor on the project;\n\n(2) the owner's name and address;\n\n(3) a description of the property or a description sufficiently specific for actual identification of the property; and\n\n(4) the name and address of any bonding company or other surety that is providing either a payment or performance bond for the project.\n\nD. The notice required to be given by the claimant pursuant to the provisions of Subsection B of this section shall contain:\n\n(1) a description of the property or a description sufficiently specific for actual identification of the property;\n\n(2) the name, address and phone number, if any, of the claimant; and\n\n(3) the name and address of the person with whom the claimant contracted or to whom the claimant furnished labor or materials, or both.\n\nE. A person required by the provisions of Subsection B of this section to give notice to enforce the person's claim of lien may elect not to give the notice, but may give the required notice at a later time. If the person elects to do so, the lien shall apply only to the work performed or materials furnished on or after the date thirty days prior to the date the notice was given. The provisions of Subsections C and D of this section apply to any notice given under this subsection.\n\nHistory:Laws 1990, ch. 92, § 2; 1993, ch. 252, § 2; 2007, ch. 212, § 1.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, in Subsection A, excluded from Subsections B through D claims of liens made by an original contractor.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, substituted \"fewer\" for \"less\" in the first sentence of Subsection A; substituted \"right\" for \"intention\" in the introductory paragraph of Subsection B; and, in Subsection E, in the second sentence, deleted \"the effective date of\" preceding \"the lien\", substituted \"shall apply only to the\" for \"for\", inserted \"performed\", and substituted \"on or after the date\" for \"will be\".\n\nNotice.— Sections 48-2-2, 48-2-2.1, 48-2-5 NMSA 1978 indicate that timing and actual or constructive notice not a general public policy favoring materialmen are the principal considerations in determining priority between suppliers and other creditors, at least in the context of private construction projects.Hasse Contracting Co., Inc. v.

      "text": "A. The liens provided for in Sections 48-2-1 through 48-2-17 NMSA 1978 are preferred to any lien, mortgage or other encumbrance which may have attached subsequent to the time when the building, improvement or structure was commenced, work done or materials were commenced to be furnished; also to any lien, mortgage or other encumbrance of which the lienholder had no notice and which was unrecorded at the time the building, improvement or structure was commenced, work done or the materials were commenced to be furnished.\n\nB. Liens filed by registered surveyors shall have priority equal with other mechanics' and materialmen's liens, but work performed by registered surveyors shall not constitute the commencement of construction.\n\nHistory:Laws 1880, ch. 16, § 5; C.L. 1884, § 1523; C.L. 1897, § 2220; Code 1915, § 3322; C.S. 1929, § 82-205; 1941 Comp., § 63-205; Laws 1947, ch. 8, § 1; 1949, ch. 18, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 61-2-5; Laws 1991, ch. 43, § 2.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The words \"this article\" were substituted for \"this act\" by the 1915 Code compilers and refer to art. 1 of ch. 67, Code 1915 compiled herein as 48-2-1 to 48-2-8, 48-2-10 to 48-2-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective April 1, 1991, in Subsection A added the subsection designation and substituted \"Sections 48-2-1 through 48-2-17 NMSA 1978\" for \"this article\" and added Subsection B.\n\nNotice.— Sections 48-2-2, 48-2-2.1, 48-2-5 NMSA 1978 indicate that timing and actual or constructive notice not a general public policy favoring materialmen are the principal considerations in determining priority between suppliers and other creditors, at least in the context of private construction projects.Hasse Contracting Co., Inc. v. KBK Fin., Inc., 1999-NMSC-023, 127 N.M. 316, 980 P.2d 641.\n\nIn order for work to constitute a \"commencement\"such work must have been done on the \"building, improvement or structure\" upon which the lien is claimed. Accordingly, work done that is not a part of the \"building, improvement or structure\" is irrelevant in assessing lien priorities.Pioneer Sav. & Trust v. Rue, 1989-NMSC-079, 109 N.M. 228, 784 P.2d 415;First Interstate Bank v. Hutchens, 1991-NMSC-086, 112 N.M. 497, 816 P.2d 1119.\n\nDetermination of priority of subcontractor's lienon a home for providing materials and labor, vis-a-vis that of a mortgage recorded after work has already commenced on the construction project, relates back to the date when any construction actually commenced, even though the subcontractor's work commenced after the mortgage was recorded.Valley Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. T-Bird Home Ctrs., Inc., 1987-NMSC-067, 106 N.M. 223, 741 P.2d 826.\n\nPrior recorded mortgages protected.— Although the statute in terms prefers mechanics' and materialmen's liens, the court has construed its language to protect mortgage liens recorded prior to commencement of work.House of Carpets, Inc. v. Mortg. Inv. Co., 85 N.M. 560, 514 P.2d 611 (1973).\n\nAs the mortgage was recorded prior to commencement of any work or the delivery of any materials to the construction site, absent any other facts, the mortgage lien would clearly prevail over the materialmen's liens by reason of this statute.House of Carpets, Inc. v. Mortgage Inv. Co., 1973-NMSC-095, 85 N.M. 560, 514 P.2d 611.\n\nPriority of obligatory advances under mortgage previously recorded.— A first mortgagee making future advances, which are optional and not obligatory under the first mortgage, with actual knowledge of an intervening lien, cannot obtain priority for subsequent advances over the intervening lien; however, where the making of the advances is obligatory upon the mortgagee or beneficiary, the lien of a mortgage or trust deed receives priority over mechanics' liens when the mortgage or deed has been recorded before the mechanics' lien attaches, despite the fact that advances are actually given subsequently to this time.House of Carpets, Inc. v. Mortgage Inv. Co., 1973-NMSC-095, 85 N.M. 560, 514 P.2d 611.\n\nIf no default, mortgagee's advances obligatory.— Note which concludes with a statement that if it becomes immediately due and payable, as a result of an event of default, the appellant will be under no obligation to advance any additional portion of this note and shall incur no liability for refusing to do so, infers that if there are no events of default, the mortgagee was obligated to continue making advances under the note and, hence, the making of future advances is obligatory rather than optional.House of Carpets, Inc. v. Mortgage Inv. Co., 1973-NMSC-095, 85 N.M. 560, 514 P.2d 611.\n\nMortgagee retains priority with contemporaneous discharge and new mortgage.— Where the holder of a senior mortgage discharges it of record, and contemporaneously therewith takes a new mortgage, he will not, in the absence of paramount equities, be held to have subordinated his security to an intervening mechanic's lien.Houston Lumber Co. v. Skaggs, 1980-NMSC-068, 94 N.M. 546, 613 P.2d 416.\n\nLien precedes any mortgage or trust deed not recorded.Stearns-Roger Mfg. Co. v. Aztec Gold Mining & Milling Co., 1908-NMSC-001, 14 N.M. 300, 93 P. 706.\n\nMortgage without priority where continuing contract.— Where owner contracted to buy materials and pay within 30 days after each shipment, it was a continuing contract during construction, and fact that owner paid for all deliveries made before a mortgage was recorded, did not give the mortgagee priority over materialman for materials furnished later.Maxwell Lumber Co. v. Connelly, 1930-NMSC-034, 34 N.M. 562, 287 P. 64.\n\nAttachment with priority.— Plaintiff seizing real estate under writ of attachment and service of lis pendens notice acquired lien having priority over mechanic's lien for work done after the filing of lis pendens notice.Bell v. Gaylord, 1891-NMSC-032, 6 N.M. 227, 27 P. 494.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Warehouseman vs. the Secured Party: Who Prevails When the Warehouseman's Lien Covers Goods Subject to a Security Interest?\" see 8 Nat.

Every original contractor, within one hundred twenty days after the completion of a contract, and every person, except the original contractor, desiring to claim a lien pursuant to Sections 48-2-1 through 48-2-17 NMSA 1978 shall, within ninety days after the completion of any building, improvement or structure or after the completion of the alteration or repair of the building, improvement or structure or the performance of any labor in a mining claim, file for record with the county clerk of the county in which the property or some part of it is situated a claim containing a statement of demands, after deducting all just credits and offsets. The claim shall state the name of the owner or reputed owner, if known, and also the name of the person by whom the claimant was employed or to whom the claimant furnished the materials, and shall include a statement of the terms, time given and the conditions of the contract, and also a description of the property to be charged with the lien, sufficient for identification. The claim shall be verified by the oath of the claimant or of some other person.\n\nB. A person filing a claim for a lien with a county clerk pursuant to Subsection A of this section shall mail, email, send by certified mail with return receipt requested or hand deliver a copy of the filed claim for a lien to the owner or reputed owner, if known, stated in the claim within fifteen days of filing the claim with the county clerk. The copy of the filed claim for a lien shall be sent or delivered to the owner or reputed owner at the owner or reputed owner's last known address. If the owner or reputed owner's address is not known, the copy of the filed claim for a lien shall be sent to the address of the owner of the property as listed in the county assessor's files. The failure of the claimant to serve the notice may preclude the recovery of interest, attorney's fees or costs.\n\nHistory:Laws 1880, ch. 16, § 6; C.L. 1884, § 1524; C.L. 1897, § 2221; Code 1915, § 3323; Laws 1921, ch. 108, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 82-206; 1941 Comp., § 63-206; 1953 Comp., § 61-2-6; Laws 1979, ch. 168, § 1; 1978 Comp., § 48-2-6; 2023, ch. 61, § 1.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, established notice requirements for filing a claim for a lien with a county clerk, and provided that the failure of the claimant to serve the notice may preclude the recovery of interest, attorney's fees or costs; in the section heading, added \"notice of lien\"; in Subsection A, after \"Sections 48-2-1 through\", deleted \"48-2-19\" and added \"48-2-17\", and after \"NMSA 1978\", deleted \"must\" and added \"shall\"; and added Subsection B.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nMechanics' lien law is remedial in nature,equitable in its enforcement and should be liberally construed.Garrett Bldg. Ctrs., Inc. v. Hale, 1981-NMSC-009, 95 N.M. 450, 623 P.2d 570.\n\nPurpose of statutory requirements.— In determining whether there has been substantial compliance, the purpose of the requirements of this section must be kept in mind, the primary object being to give notice to subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers and inform the owner of the extent and nature of the lienor's claim.Marsh v. Coleman, 1979-NMSC-067, 93 N.M. 325, 600 P.2d 271;Garrett Bldg. Ctrs., Inc. v. Hale, 1981-NMSC-009, 95 N.M. 450, 623 P.2d 570.\n\nThis statute must be liberally construed.Hot Springs Plumbing & Heating Co. v. Wallace, 1933-NMSC-092, 38 N.M. 3, 27 P.2d 984.\n\nLiberal construction.— The Mechanics' Lien Law, though in derogation of the common law, is remedial in its nature and is to have a liberal construction.Chavez v. Sedillo, 1955-NMSC-039, 59 N.M. 357, 284 P.2d 1026.\n\nSupreme court will follow California decisionsin construction of lien statute.Chavez v. Sedillo, 1955-NMSC-039, 59 N.M. 357, 284 P.2d 1026.\n\nOnly substantial compliance with terms of this section is required.Marsh v. Coleman, 1979-NMSC-067, 93 N.M. 325, 600 P.2d 271;Garrett Bldg. Ctrs., Inc. v. Hale, 1981-NMSC-009, 95 N.M. 450, 623 P.2d 570.\n\nClaimant's name must appear on claim of lien.— There is no requirement under this section that a claim of lien contain a description of the type of entity that filed it; it is only necessary that the name of the claimant appear on the claim of lien, and courts have been liberal in upholding claims or statements in this respect.Marsh v. Coleman, 1979-NMSC-067, 93 N.M. 325, 600 P.2d 271.\n\nProof under pleadings inexcusable trouble, expense.— Where under pleadings upon which the plaintiff has elected to stand he would have to prove matters at variance with the claim of lien he is seeking to foreclose, to put the parties to proof would result in inexcusable trouble and expense.Chavez v. Sedillo, 1955-NMSC-039, 59 N.M. 357, 284 P.2d 1026.\n\nSeparate orders for material did not create separate lienswhere the understanding was that the materialman would furnish as much as the owner needed.Hot Springs Plumbing & Heating Co. v. Wallace, 1933-NMSC-092, 38 N.M. 3, 27 P.2d 984.\n\nWhen overstatement of amount due no invalidation.— In the absence of fraud or bad faith, an overstatement of the amount due does not invalidate a claim of lien.Marsh v. Coleman, 1979-NMSC-067, 93 N.M. 325, 600 P.2d 271.\n\nEffective recording without full payment.— Materialman's lien was filed for record within contemplation of statute even though it was accepted by the clerk without requiring payment of the full fee therefor, and the lien was superior to subsequent mortgage liens upon the premises therein described.Hedrick v. Jagger, 1942-NMSC-047, 46 N.M. 379, 129 P.2d 340.\n\nSuperintendent's claim void.— A superintendent's claim for a fixed sum for all his services, part of which was not within the scope of the statute, was void in toto.Boyle v. Mountain Key Mining Co., 1897-NMSC-024, 9 N.M. 237, 50 P. 347.\n\nNotice requirement for a workers' compensation insurer's claimof a lien right against a performance bond, given in connection with a state construction project, was governed by this article, and not by the Little Miller Act, Sections 13-4-18 to 13-4-20 NMSA 1978.State ex rel. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co. v. KNC, Inc., 1987-NMSC-063, 106 N.M. 140, 740 P.2d 690.\n\nII. SUFFICIENCY OF CLAIM.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nNo special statutory requirements for the allegations in complaintsto enforce a mechanic's lien.Daughtrey v. Carpenter, 1970-NMSC-151, 82 N.M. 173, 477 P.2d 807.\n\nAlteration of original lien claim did not void itwhere cross claim of appellee was not based upon the original lien claim, but upon supplemental lien claim attached to the pleading which appeared to be timely filed, to contain the necessary recitals, and to be properly verified.Daughtrey v. Carpenter, 1970-NMSC-151, 82 N.M. 173, 477 P.2d 807.\n\nNotice attachment to complaint not required.— In action to foreclose, a copy of the notice of lien need not be attached to the complaint, the action not being founded on the notice.Weggs v. Kreugel, 1922-NMSC-021, 28 N.M. 24, 205 P. 730.\n\nRecorded lien, lacking acknowledgment, valid and binding between parties.— A valid materialmen's lien which lacked an acknowledgment, but had been filed and recorded, was valid and binding as between the parties to an action on the lien.Garrett Bldg. Ctrs., Inc. v. Hale, 1981-NMSC-009, 95 N.M. 450, 623 P.2d 570.\n\nEvidence.— Circumstantial evidence is sufficient to foreclose on a materialmen's lien.Consol. Elec. Distribs., Inc. v. Santa Fe Hotel Group, LLC, 2006-NMCA-005, 138 N.M. 781, 126 P.3d 1145.\n\nDirect evidence is not required to establish the required elements for a valid lien.Consol. Elec. Distribs., Inc. v. Santa Fe Hotel Group, LLC, 2006-NMCA-005, 138 N.M. 781, 126 P.3d 1145.\n\nB. IDENTIFICATION OF LAND.\n\nClaim should contain a description of the property sufficient for identification.Ackerson v. Albuquerque Lumber Co., 1934-NMSC-010, 38 N.M. 191, 29 P.2d 714.\n\nRequirement of land identification in claim complied with.— Where lien form claim listed mechanics' claim as against lot upon which minor portion of building was located but statement of charges for work completed correctly described address of building and owners admitted in answer that building was located at the named address, statute requiring that land identified in lien claim be land upon which improvements were made was complied with.Boone v. Smith, 1968-NMSC-172, 79 N.M. 614, 447 P.2d 23.\n\nInsufficient identification of land.— Property described as \"Lot one (1) of block numbered thirty-five (35) in the Terrace Addition\" was not sufficiently identified where there was no block 35 in the Terrace Addition.Ackerson v. Albuquerque Lumber Co., 1934-NMSC-010, 38 N.M. 191, 29 P.2d 714.\n\nActual knowledge irrelevant as to land description.— Actual knowledge plays no part in the test of description \"sufficient for identification,\" and the same rule applies in case of the owner or one in possession of the facts as against the subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer in good faith.Ackerson v. Albuquerque Lumber Co., 1934-NMSC-010, 38 N.M. 191, 29 P.2d 714.\n\nC. IDENTIFICATION OF PARTIES.\n\nOwner identification sufficient.— Notices of claims for mechanics' liens were not insufficient because they alleged that the defendant \"was the owner or reputed owner\" of the mine against which the liens were sought to be established, since the designation made no difference in the liability.Minor v. Marshall, 1891-NMSC-029, 6 N.M. 194, 27 P. 481.\n\nContrasting party required to be named.— This section did not require lien claimant to advise owner that lien was created by virtue of contract made with owner's agent, but it did require claimant to give owner name of party with whom contract was made.Ford v. Springer Land Ass'n, 1895-NMSC-011, 8 N.M. 37, 41 P. 541,aff'd, 168 U.S. 513, 18 S. Ct. 170, 42 L. Ed. 562 (1897);E.J. Post & Co. v. Miles, 1893-NMSC-033, 7 N.M. 317, 34 P. 586.\n\nD. STATEMENT OF TERMS.\n\nClaim showing amount due sufficient.— Claim for mechanic's lien was sufficient, which showed amount due after deducting credits and offsets for excavation and embankments made under special contract, copy of which was attached to claim.Springer Land Ass'n v. Ford, 168 U.S. 513, 18 S. Ct. 170, 42 L. Ed. 562 (1897),aff'g, 1895-NMSC-011, 8 N.M. 37, 41 P. 541.\n\nStatement of contract terms.— This section requires \"a statement of the terms, time given and conditions of his contract\" and where under this recital in the printed form is typed \"30 days net cash,\" the lien claim would comply with the requirements of the statute.Daughtrey v. Carpenter, 1970-NMSC-151, 82 N.M. 173, 477 P.2d 807.\n\nRequirements for lien claim.— The claim of lien must not only contain a statement of the terms, time given and conditions of the contract, but such statement must be true.Chavez v. Sedillo, 1955-NMSC-039, 59 N.M. 357, 284 P.2d 1026.\n\nE. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.\n\nMaterialmen's liens must be filed within statutory period,after which the remedy becomes unavailable to the claimant.Garrett Bldg. Ctrs., Inc. v. Hale, 1981-NMSC-009, 95 N.M. 450, 623 P.2d 570.\n\nLien timely filed 90 days after job completion.— Where the lien was filed on July 25, 2001, as the job was completed on April 26, 2001, and 90 days from April 26 expired on July 25, the lien was timely filed.Consol. Elec. Distribs., Inc. v. Santa Fe Hotel Group, LLC, 2006-NMCA-005, 138 N.M. 781, 126 P.3d 1145.\n\nNo running of limitations where structure not substantially completed.— Where contractor failed to install elevating doors to a driveway through a wall of funeral home structure, or seven wheel guards on driveway, or iron pipe balcony rail, or ornamental iron grilles on three windows, structure was not substantially completed so as to start running of limitations against a mechanic's lien.Allison v. Schuler, 1934-NMSC-072, 38 N.M. 506, 36 P.2d 519.\n\n\"Substantial completion\"of a building, improvement or structure is adequate to start the running of the limitation period within which a claim of lien of a material supplier must be filed.Tabet Lumber Co. v. Baughman, 1968-NMSC-061, 79 N.M. 57, 439 P.2d 706.\n\nExplanation of \"substantial completion\".— Under former law, it was held that substantial completion was completion within meaning of provision of Mechanic's Lien Law (prior to 1921 amendment) requiring subcontractor to file lien within 60 days after completion of building.Baldridge v. Morgan, 1910-NMSC-003, 15 N.M. 249, 106 P. 342;Genest v. Las Vegas Masonic Bldg. Ass'n, 1902-NMSC-003, 11 N.M. 251, 67 P. 743.\n\nBuilding is \"substantially completed\" notwithstanding trivial imperfections or omissions.Tabet Lumber Co. v. Baughman, 1968-NMSC-061, 79 N.M. 57, 439 P.2d 706.\n\nA building is substantially completed for purpose of determining timeliness of mechanics' lienswhen all of the essentials necessary to the full accomplishment of the purpose for which the building has been constructed are performed.Tabet Lumber Co. v. Baughman, 1968-NMSC-061, 79 N.M. 57, 439 P.2d 706.\n\nPeriod limited for filing a lien begins to run,as to each item of a running account, from the date when the last item was furnished.Skidmore v. Eby, 1953-NMSC-098, 57 N.M. 669, 262 P.2d 370.\n\nLien timely filed two months after furnishing materials.— Where none of the several suspensions of work on the house were caused by any act or default chargeable to the material furnisher, and all of them were occasioned by the contractor's recurring breaches of the construction contract, and where the owner never abandoned his attempts to persuade the contractor to resume work and complete his original contract, twice amended, and although it took 33 months to finish the job, and where the owner paid all material bills due the materialman except those incurred during the last 18 months before completion, under such circumstances the lien filed within two months after furnishing the last item of material was filed in time.Skidmore v. Eby, 1953-NMSC-098, 57 N.M. 669, 262 P.2d 370.\n\nSuit filed timely within six months after debt due.— If the agreement contemplated time in which to pay (credit) then the requirement that suit to foreclose the lien must be brought within one year after filing was extended so as to make timely a suit filed within six months after the debt was due, but not later than two years after completion of the work.Mut. Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Fidel, 1968-NMSC-015, 78 N.M. 673, 437 P.2d 134.\n\nAbandonment equivalent to completion.— Where dumbwaiter accessory was abandoned by agreement of contractor and homeowners more than 90 days before lumber supplier filed mechanic's lien, such abandonment was equivalent in law to completion for purpose of determining timeliness of filing of mechanic's lien.Tabet Lumber Co. v. Baughman, 1968-NMSC-061, 79 N.M. 57, 439 P.2d 706.\n\nTemporary interruption not abandonment.— The temporary interruption in the furnishing of materials by a materialman, pending the making of more satisfactory credit arrangements, is not an abandonment of the undertaking to start the running of limitations.Hot Springs Plumbing & Heating Co. v. Wallace, 1933-NMSC-092, 38 N.M. 3, 27 P.2d 984.\n\nOmitting work to seek additional finances did not constitute abandonment.Allison v. Schuler, 1934-NMSC-072, 38 N.M. 506, 36 P.2d 519.\n\nEquitable tolling.— District court acted within its discretion in applying equitable principles to toll the running of the filing deadline; although the contractors were told they would be paid upon inspection of the property and closing of the loan, they did not receive notice of an inspection or closing date despite repeated attempts to secure such information from the loan officer, and as such, the running of the 120-day filing deadline started from the time that the contractors realized they would not be paid in full from the proceeds of the owners' loan.Chase Manhattan Mortg. Corp. v. Caraway, 2003-NMCA-020, 133 N.M. 291, 62 P.3d 748.\n\nRight to foreclosure existed immediately upon filing lien,and the six-month period of limitations immediately began to run, and any disability which arrests the running of the statute must exist at the time the right of action accrues. The statute having once attached, the period will continue to run, and is not suspended by any subsequent disability.Mut. Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Fide, 1968-NMSC-015, 78 N.M. 673, 437 P.2d 134.\n\nNo foreclosure right upon filing invalid lien.— The mere filing of a materialman's lien did not give defendant the right to foreclose the lien, where the lien was invalid from its inception because it was filed after defendant knew that the swimming pool heater he had furnished was not actually used, and it was not a part of the swimming pool.Branch v. Mays, 1976-NMCA-086, 89 N.M. 536, 554 P.2d 1297.\n\nNo extension unless offered accepted.— The claim and statement which constituted a mechanic's lien had to be filed within 60 days (now 90 days) after completion of the contract, and a proposal to extend the contract unless accepted was of no effect as an extension.Wiley v. San Pedro & Canon Del Agua Co., 1889-NMSC-009, 5 N.M. 111, 20 P. 115.\n\nAbbreviated filing period contingent on notice to subcontractor.— Where no notice was given by the contractor to the subcontractor as required in Paragraph B of 48-2-10.1 NMSA 1978 (repealed), the abbreviated 20-day notice requirement of that section is not applicable, and a subcontractor is entitled to rely on the 90-day notice provision of this section.Pyburn v. Kirkpatrick, 1987-NMSC-076, 106 N.M. 247, 741 P.2d 1368.\n\nTime for filing.— Under former law, it was held that the provision of the mechanic's lien statute (prior to 1921 amendment) requiring subcontractor to file lien within 60 days after completion of building did not fix period of time during which a lien of a subcontractor had to be filed, but fixed a point of time after which such lien could not be filed.Baldridge v. Morgan, 1910-NMSC-003, 15 N.M. 249, 106 P. 342.\n\nF. VERIFICATION.\n\nVerification requirement of this section is to be liberally construed.Garrett Bldg. Ctrs., Inc. v. Hale, 1981-NMSC-009, 95 N.M. 450, 623 P.2d 570.\n\nVerification of entire claim required.— The claim itself, and not any one or more averments of the claim less than all, must be verified.Minor v. Marshall, 1891-NMSC-029, 6 N.M. 194, 27 P. 481.\n\nVerification is a mandatory precondition to the lien's validity.— The use of the word \"must\" in the statute requiring verification by oath conveys the legislature's setting a mandatory precondition to the lien's validity. In enacting this section, the legislature required some positive affirmation of good faith undertaken upon oath as to the contents of a notice of lien to render any claim thereof valid. Without verification, no lien is created.Sonida, LLC v. Spoverlook, LLC, 2016-NMCA-026.\n\nIn a dispute arising out of or relating to a lien action following a dispute over construction of a house, where plaintiff filed a claim of lien against the home to protect its interests, but where none of the lien documents included any language verifying upon oath the truth of its contents, plaintiff's claims of lien were voidab initiobecause no valid lien was created, and they could not therefore support a foreclosure action on the lien as a matter of law, or provide any basis for action under 48-2-14 NMSA 1978 or attorney fees to be awarded under that statute.Sonida, LLC v. Spoverlook, LLC, 2016-NMCA-026.\n\nFailure of verification fatal.— Where, though claim for mechanic's lien purported to have been sworn to, neither the signature nor seal of the officer before whom it was purportedly verified appeared, such failure was fatal to admissibility of the paper as a claim of lien and to the right to enforce any lien based thereon.Finane v. Las Vegas Hotel & Improvement Co., 1885-NMSC-023, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 411, 5 P. 725,overruled on other grounds byFord v. Springer Land Ass'n, 1895-NMSC-011, 8 N.M. 37, 41 P. 541.\n\nSubstantial compliance as to verification is all that is required.Lyons v. Howard, 1911-NMSC-039, 16 N.M. 327, 117 P. 842.\n\nInsufficient compliance with verification requirements.— A total absence of any words confirming correctness, truth or authenticity by affidavit, oath, deposition or otherwise, is not sufficient compliance with the requirements of a verification.Home Plumbing & Contracting Co. v. Pruitt, 1962-NMSC-075, 70 N.M. 182, 372 P.2d 378.\n\nAcknowledgment to mechanics' lien in form provided by Section 14-13-9 NMSA 1978 (repealed) is insufficientto comply with the verification requirement of this section.N.M. Properties, Inc. v. Lennox Indus., Inc., 1980-NMSC-087, 95 N.M. 64, 618 P.2d 1228.\n\nClerk of district court of sister state could administer oathto a lien claimant when, under the laws of the sister state, such clerk was empowered to administer oaths, especially where the laws of New Mexico recognized the right of clerks to administer oaths.Genest v. Las Vegas Masonic Bldg. Ass'n, 1902-NMSC-003, 11 N.M. 251, 67 P. 743.\n\nLien claim could be acknowledged by clerk of probate court,in absence of an authorizing statute, because clerks of courts of record at common law could administer oaths and the probate court met the requirements of a common-law court of record.Bucher v. Thompson, 1893-NMSC-010, 7 N.M. 115, 32 P. 498.\n\nThis act does not require an affidavitto claim of lien; claim is sufficient if signed by a party, and if notary or other proper officer says that it is sworn to by the person signing it.Lyons v. Howard, 1911-NMSC-039, 16 N.M. 327, 117 P. 842.\n\nG. SUFFICIENCY OF NOTICE.\n\nExact statutory words not required.— Notice of mechanic's lien was not fatally defective for failure to use exact words of statute as to amount remaining due after allowing all just credits and offsets.Hobbs v. Spiegelberg, 1885-NMSC-014, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 357, 5 P. 529.\n\nSignature sufficient.— A notice of lien is not void because the Christian name of the person signing was designated by initials.Pearce v. Albright, 1904-NMSC-015, 12 N.M. 202, 76 P. 286.\n\nNotice where record filed as to balance.— Where claim was simply the account of the laborer or materialman, notice thereof could be filed for record simply in the form of ordinary bookkeeping, showing on one page the debits, on the opposite page the credits, striking a balance and alleging under oath that the amount there stated was due.Hobbs v. Spiegelberg, 1885-NMSC-014, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 357, 5 P. 529.\n\nIf actual notice, no claim of ignorance by owner.— The primary object of filing the claim is to give notice to subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers and inform the owner of the extent and nature of the lienor's claim and as defendant was the owner he cannot rightfully claim that he was ignorant of the extent and nature of the lienor's claim, having in fact actual notice of the terms and conditions of the contract.Crego Block Co. v. D.H. Overmyer Co., 1969-NMSC-117, 80 N.M. 541, 458 P.2d 793.\n\nIII. GENERAL DEFINITIONS.\n\n\"Original contractor\" defined.— As bearing on time for filing claim of lien, every person who deals directly with the owner of property and who, in pursuance of a contract with him, performs labor or furnishes materials is an original contractor.Gray v. N.M. Pumice Stone Co., 1910-NMSC-036, 15 N.M. 478, 110 P. 603.\n\nMaterialman as \"original contractor\".— A materialman who sells material to a conditional vendee in possession is dealing with the \"owner\" and is an \"original contractor.\"Freidenbloom v. Pecos Valley Lumber Co., 1930-NMSC-081, 35 N.M. 154, 290 P. 797.\n\nMaterialmen furnishing plumbing and heating supplies for a building are \"original contractors\"under this statute and required to file claim within 120 days (now 90 days) after completion of contract.Hot Springs Plumbing & Heating Co. v. Wallace, 1933-NMSC-092, 38 N.M. 3, 27 P.2d 984.\n\nLegal title not necessary to be \"owner\".— One who pays part of the purchase price for real estate and takes possession in order to make improvements where it is expected that he will remain in possession, making subsequent payments, is an \"owner\" under this section, not withstanding that legal title was in name of another.Hill v. Long, 1956-NMSC-066, 61 N.M. 299, 299 P.2d 472.\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico law relating to property, see 12 N.M.L. Rev. 459 (1982).\n\nAm.

The owner of any building, mining claim, improvement or structure subject to a lien under Sections 48-2-1 through 48-2-17 NMSA 1978 or an original contractor having a contract with that owner may petition the district court for the county in which the property or a part of it is located for an order canceling the lien.\n\nB. Upon the filing of the petition, the district court judge shall examine the lien claimant's recorded demands and determine an amount sufficient to satisfy the recorded demands and any other damages, court costs or attorney fees that may be recovered by the lien claimant. Security, in the amount set by the judge and of a type approved by the judge, shall be deposited by the owner of the property or original contractor with the district court conditioned on the payment of any sum found to be validly due to the lien claimant. An owner or original contractor may not provide a single security for the cancellation of the lien of more than one claimant.\n\nC. When the security is deposited under this section, the judge of the district court shall immediately issue an order canceling the lien and shall notify the county clerk with whom the lien was filed. Upon the recording of the order, the county clerk shall mark the filed lien as canceled. When an order is issued under this subsection, the claimant's lien attaches to the security and is enforceable as to the security in the district court in which it is deposited to the same extent as any other lien provided for in Sections 48-2-1 through 48-2-17 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 61-2-8.1, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 68, § 1; 2007, ch. 212, § 2.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, provided that the owner of property subject to a lien under 48-2-1 through 48-2-17 NMSA 1978 or an original contractor having a contract with the owner may petition the district court for an order to cancel the lien; that an owner or original contractor may not provide a single security for the cancellation of a lien of more than one claimant; and that when a claimant's lien attaches to security, it is enforceable as provided in 48-2-1 through 48-2-17 NMSA 1978.",

A contingent payment clause in a contract shall not be construed as a waiver of the right to file and enforce a mechanic's or materialman's lien pursuant to Sections 48-2-1 through 48-2-17 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:Laws 1880, ch. 16, § 9; C.L. 1884, § 1527; C.L. 1897, § 2224; Code 1915, § 3326; C.S. 1929, § 82-209; 1941 Comp., § 63-209; 1953 Comp., § 61-2-9; Laws 1979, ch. 168, § 2; 1990, ch. 92, § 1; 2007, ch. 212, § 3.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, tolled the limitation if the lien was submitted to arbitration within the two-year period and provided that a contingent payment clause shall not be construed as a waiver of the right to file and enforce a lien.\n\nThe 1990 amendment,effective May 16, 1990, rewrote the section to the extent that a detailed comparison is impracticable.\n\nDefinition of \"credit\".— \"Credit\" as that term is used in the statute, refers to terms for payment agreed upon when the sale is made, or possibly at a later time, but before filing of the claim of lien.Mut. Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Fidel, 1968-NMSC-015, 78 N.M. 673, 437 P.2d 134 (decided under prior law).\n\nCommencement of proceeding by filing, service of motion.— The filing and service of a motion to intervene, accompanied by a pleading setting forth the claim, constitutes the commencement of a proceeding for the mechanic's lien.Brito v. Carpenter, 1970-NMSC-104, 81 N.M. 716, 472 P.2d 979;Callaway v. Ryan, 1960-NMSC-088, 67 N.M. 283, 354 P.2d 999.\n\nSuit timely if within six months after debt due.— If the agreement contemplated time in which to pay (credit), then the requirement that suit to foreclose the lien must be brought within one year after filing was extended so as to make timely a suit filed within six months after the debt was due, but not later than two years after completion of the work.Mut. Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Fidel, 1968-NMSC-015, 78 N.M. 673, 437 P.2d 134 (decided prior to 1990 amendment).\n\nJudgment reversed where late filing to enforce lien.— Under former mechanics' lien statutes the pleading seeking the enforcement of a lien against the property had to be filed in the proper court within one year (now two years) from the date of filing the lien, and where no such pleading was filed to enforce appellee's lien within that time the judgment for plaintiff had to be reversed.Brito v. Carpenter, 1970-NMSC-104, 81 N.M. 716, 472 P.2d 979 (decided prior to 1990 amendment).\n\nOnce attached, statute of limitations not suspended by subsequent disability.— The right to foreclosure existed immediately upon the filing of the lien, and the period of limitations immediately began to run, and any disability which arrested the running of the statute had to exist at the time the right of action accrued. The statute having once attached, the period continued to run, and was not suspended by any subsequent disability.Mut. Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Fidel, 1968-NMSC-015, 78 N.M. 673, 437 P.2d 134 (decided prior to 1990 amendment).\n\nAutomatic stay in bankruptcy proceeding.— Statutory enforcement period was tolled pursuant to the federal bankruptcy law, where an automatic stay arising from the filing of a bankruptcy petition had prevented the lienholder from foreclosing on property leased by the owner to the bankruptcy debtor.Valley Transit Mix of Ruidoso, Inc. v. Miller, 928 F.2d 354 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\nIssue treated as raised by pleadings where tried with consent.— Where appellants made no objection to evidence of contractor's license and raised neither the jurisdiction nor the limitation question at trial, and requested no findings on either question, the requirement of the allegation of a contractor's license was a matter of public policy and did not, otherwise, bear any relation to the cause of action; and appellant cannot object to appellate court treating an issue tried with consent of the parties as though it had been raised by the pleadings.Daughtrey v.

      "text": "Every building or other improvement mentioned in the second section [48-2-2 NMSA 1978] of this article, constructed upon any lands with the knowledge of the owner or the person having or claiming any interest therein, shall be held to have been constructed at the instance of such owner or person having or claiming any interest therein, and the interest owned or claimed shall be subject to any lien filed in accordance with the provisions of this article, unless such owner or person having or claiming an interest therein shall, within three days after he shall have obtained knowledge of the construction, alteration or repair, or the intended construction, alteration or repair, give notice that he will not be responsible for the same, by posting a notice in writing to the effect, in some conspicuous place upon said land, or upon the building or other improvement situated thereon.\n\nHistory:Laws 1880, ch. 16, § 11; C.L. 1884, § 1529; C.L. 1897, § 2226; Code 1915, § 3327; C.S. 1929, § 82-210; 1941 Comp., § 63-210; 1953 Comp., § 61-2-10.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nAny interest claimed.— The reference in Section 48-2-11 NMSA 1978 to \"any interest claimed\" suggests that, even if a leasehold constitutes personal property for the purposes of Chapter 48, the leasehold can still be subject to a mechanic's lien.In re Furr's Supermarkets, Inc., 315 B.R. 776 (Bankr. D.N.M. 2004)\n\nTheory of act.— This act is based on considerations of benefits deemed adequate to overcome constitutional barriers, absence of which may not be proved to defeat lien claimed, and to raise against owner the conclusive presumption that he consented to improvements of which he knew if within three days after acquiring such knowledge he does not post, on premises in another's possession, statutory notice of nonliability.Petrakis v. Krasnow, 1949-NMSC-073, 54 N.M. 39, 213 P.2d 220.\n\nTime for posting.— Although lessor has granted lessee rent free for a year in consideration of repairs to the building, and hence had knowledge that repairs had to be made, his posted notice three days after he had knowledge that work had actually begun was timely.Rio Grande Lumber & Fuel Co. v. Buergo, 1937-NMSC-078, 41 N.M. 624, 73 P.2d 312.\n\nTime of notice of nonresponsibility as to third parties.— When the claimant gives the owner, in his claim, the name of the party with whom the contract was made, it becomes the owner's duty, within three days after he shall have obtained knowledge of the contract, to give notice that he will not be responsible for the same, and if he fails to do so he is bound by the lien.E.J. Post & Co. v. Miles, 1893-NMSC-033, 7 N.M. 317, 34 P. 586.\n\nPersonal liability of owner to subcontractors.— Property owner cannot be held personally liable to subcontractors for work and material where there was no contractual relationship between him and the subcontractors and the principal contractor had agreed to pay them.Allison v. Schuler, 1934-NMSC-072, 38 N.M. 506, 36 P.2d 519.\n\nBy posting notice of nonliability, owner does not become a guarantorthat the notice thus given in statutory form will always be brought home to potential lien claimants.Petrakis v. Krasnow, 1949-NMSC-073, 54 N.M. 39, 213 P.2d 220.\n\nLien when owner with knowledge, failed to post notice.— Contractor doing earth work in constructing ditch and reservoir system was entitled to lien thereon and land appurtenant thereto where it appeared that his employer, by a contract with the owner, was to receive part of the proceeds of sale of such lands when sold at an increased value, after construction of the ditch, that owner had full notice of the construction contract, and that owner gave no notice that it would not be responsible for the work as required by this section.Ford v. Springer Land Ass'n, 1895-NMSC-011, 8 N.M. 37, 41 P. 541,aff'd, 168 U.S. 513, 18 S. Ct. 170, 42 L. Ed. 562 (1897).\n\nFailure to post notice.— Where the owners of a mine have known of the employment of laborers by their agent and fail to post notice as above provided, the laborers are entitled to a lien.Pearce v. Albright, 1904-NMSC-015, 12 N.M. 202, 76 P. 286;Post v. Fleming, 1900-NMSC-033, 10 N.M. 476, 62 P. 1087.\n\nLegal owner with duty to post notice.— Where one pays part of the purchase price for real estate and takes possession in order to make improvements, but legal title remains in another, it is the duty of the party holding legal title, if he knows the work is being done and he wishes to protect his interest in the real estate against the possibility of lien claims, to post notice on the property that he will not assume any responsibility for any work done or material furnished.Hill v. Long, 1956-NMSC-066, 61 N.M. 299, 299 P.2d 472.\n\nVendee under executory contract not vendor's agent.— Vendee, under executory contract reserving legal title in vendor, though \"builder\" of improvements thereon, was not agent of vendor.Albuquerque Lumber Co. v. Tomei, 1926-NMSC-033, 32 N.M. 5, 250 P. 21.\n\nIf no posting because of representation, owner protected by equity.— Where contractor's representative promised land owner that mechanic's lien would not be filed against the land if owner refrained from posting a nonresponsibility notice, equitable estoppel applied to prevent foreclosure of lien against land by contractor, despite lack of nonresponsibility notice.Franklin's Earthmoving, Inc. v. Loma Linda Park, 1964-NMSC-219, 74 N.M. 530, 395 P.2d 454.\n\nOral notice insufficient.— Where a lumber company sells materials to a purchaser of a lot on contract, title to which has not yet been acquired, oral notice by lot owner to the lumber company, that the purchaser has no title, is not sufficient to avoid liability of the lot owner on mechanic's lien absent the posting of the premises required by this section.Albuquerque Lumber Co. v. Montevista Co., 1934-NMSC-086, 39 N.M. 6, 38 P.2d 77 (1934).\n\nNotice irrelevant when owner involved in contract.— An owner of land who, himself, orders or contracts for an improvement to be erected thereon cannot escape responsibility for materials purchased for use in the improvement, and the posting of a notice in such a case amounts to nothing.Skidmore v. Eby, 1953-NMSC-098, 57 N.M. 669, 262 P.2d 370.\n\nThis section is not applicable to a person who caused the building to be constructed or who contracted for the improvements directly or indirectly.Skidmore v. Eby, 1953-NMSC-098, 57 N.M. 669, 262 P.2d 370.\n\nGood faith posting required.— A vendor under executory contract for sale of real estate does not automatically absolve his premises from liability by the mere physical act of posting notices when, contrary to the legislative intent, the posting was not in good faith and was done under circumstances which the vendor must have realized would preclude the notice contemplated by the act.Petrakis v. Krasnow, 1949-NMSC-073, 54 N.M. 39, 213 P.2d 220.\n\nOwner with good faith duty to replace notice.— Where owner learns that notice he has previously posted has been destroyed or torn down before reasonable time has elapsed, good faith calls upon him to repost.Petrakis v. Krasnow, 1949-NMSC-073, 54 N.M. 39, 213 P.2d 220.\n\nPresumption notices remained posted.— Where notices of nonresponsibility had been posted securely by the vendor on two buildings and on board fence behind which construction was proceeding and the improvements contracted for by the purchasers in possession did not require demolition of the posting places, supreme court presumed that the notices remained posted for adequate period of time to acquaint the persons whom they were designed to reach with the information to be imparted.Petrakis v. Krasnow, 1949-NMSC-073, 54 N.M. 39, 213 P.2d 220.\n\nBurden shifted to lien claimant by such presumption.— Where presumption has arisen that notices remain posted for sufficient time to impart knowledge to persons sought to be reached, the burden shifts to the lien claimants to develop proof by way of confession and avoidance to nullify effect of the notice thus attempted.Petrakis v. Krasnow, 1949-NMSC-073, 54 N.M. 39, 213 P.2d 220.\n\nIn determining whether articles are fixtures, intent is the chief testand must affirmatively and plainly appear.Boone v. Smith, 1968-NMSC-172, 79 N.M. 614, 447 P.2d 23.\n\nWiring, heating intended as fixtures subject to lien.— Where building required installation of electric wiring and heating to be usable and lease provided that improvements made by lessee with consent of lessor would merge and become part of realty, improvements were intended to be fixtures and subject to mechanics' liens.Boone v. Smith, 1968-NMSC-172, 79 N.M. 614, 447 P.2d 23.\n\nIf improvements not fixtures, lien inapplicable.— Where by express terms of a lease it is provided that improvements shall not become fixtures, and where the nature of the article is such that it is not to be permanently attached to the land, it probably remains personalty and not subject to a mechanic's lien.Boone v. Smith, 1968-NMSC-172, 79 N.M. 614, 447 P.2d 23.\n\nArticles part of building where securely attached.— Where articles are securely attached to building and are used for the purpose for which they were installed, these articles annexed to the building with the owner's knowledge became a part of the building itself.Boone v. Smith, 1968-NMSC-172, 79 N.M. 614, 447 P.2d 23.\n\nForeclosure on mining claims.— In action to foreclose liens on mining claims, owner could consistently take position that disclaimer provision of section did not apply to mining claims and, at same time, contend that if they did, she had complied with them.Mitchell v. McCutcheon, 1927-NMSC-061, 33 N.M. 78, 260 P. 1086 (1927).\n\nLand identification sufficient.— Where lien form claim listed mechanics' claim as against lot upon which minor portion of building was located but statement of charges for work completed correctly described address of building and owners admitted in answer that building was located at the named address, statute requiring that land identified in lien claim be land upon which improvements were made was complied with.Boone v. Smith, 1968-NMSC-172, 79 N.M. 614, 447 P.2d 23.\n\nNotice to general manager of corporation is sufficient notice to corporation.Stearns-Roger Mfg. Co. v. Aztec Gold Mining & Milling Co., 1908-NMSC-001, 14 N.M. 300, 93 P. 706.\n\nIf Oil Act applicable, no enforcement without express contract.— Under the Mechanics' Act, a lien may be imposed upon the fee owner's interest if he has knowledge of the construction and fails to disclaim responsibility therefor in the manner and within the time therein provided while under the Oil Act (Section 70-4-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.), the fee owner's interest is subject to a lien only if he expressly so contracts, which is an obvious conflict if both acts apply. It was held that a company which built roads, leveled land, hauled water and provided gravel and load pipe in connection with certain oil and gas exploration and drilling were only entitled to assert a lien under the Oil Act.Butt v. Vermejo Park Corp., 1976-NMSC-075, 89 N.M. 679, 556 P.2d 835.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —Knowledge of owner of improvements or repairs, intended or in process under orders of lessee or vendee, as \"consent,\" which will subject his interest to mechanics' liens, 4 A.L.R. 685.\n\nConstruction and application of statutory provisions making notice by owner of nonresponsibility for work or improvement on his property necessary to prevent attachment of mechanic's lien, 123 A.L.R. 7, 85 A.L.R.2d 949.\n\nSufficiency of notice of nonresponsibility, 85 A.L.R.2d 949.\n\n56 C.J.S.

If the amount of the judgment exceeds the amount due by the owner to the contractor, or if the owner settles with the contractor in full, the owner shall be entitled to recover back from the contractor any amount paid by the owner, in excess of the contract price, and for which the contractor was originally the party liable.\n\nHistory:Laws 1880, ch. 16, § 12; C.L. 1884, § 1530; C.L. 1897, § 2227; Code 1915, § 3328; C.S. 1929, § 82-211; 1941 Comp., § 63-211; 1953 Comp., § 61-2-11; 2007, ch. 212, § 4.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, eliminated the requirement that the contractor defend an action brought by a subcontractor and prohibited the owner from withholding money if the lien was asserted as a result of the owner's failure to pay the contractor for work done and materials furnished.\n\nContractor obligated to owner for judgment, expenses of defense.— Owner, who was held liable for the lien, was entitled to judgment over against contractor for such amount, together with his expenses incurred in defending the action, since under this section the contractor was obligated to defend the action at his own expense.Skidmore v. Eby, 1953-NMSC-098, 57 N.M. 669, 262 P.2d 370.\n\nRecovery limited to contract.— Under this section, a contractor is entitled to recover upon a lien filed by him only such an amount as may be due him according to the terms of his contract.Nickle v. Coulter, 1916-NMSC-054, 22 N.M. 105, 159 P. 673.\n\nSeparate finding erroneous where contractors, owners jointly liable.— In action by subcontractors to enforce lien by assumpsit, on a joint liability of the contractors and owners, it was error to find separately against the owners for sale of the property, and a general judgment for the money against the contractors.Rupe v. N.M. Lumber Ass'n, 1885-NMSC-020, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 393, 5 P. 730.\n\nSupplier, not contractor, held indispensable party.— There is nothing in this section which makes the contractor an indispensable party. The tests of indispensability are whether the plaintiff is the owner of the right sought to be enforced, and whether he could release and discharge the defendant from the liability upon which the action is grounded. The supplier, as plaintiff, meets these tests, without the addition of the contractor.Crego Block Co. v. D.H. Overmyer Co., 1969-NMSC-117, 80 N.M. 541, 458 P.2d 793.\n\nContractor is not indispensable party in suit involving lien foreclosure.Crego Block Co. v. D.H.

Sweazea, 1968-NMCA-008, 78 N.M. 781, 438 P.2d 525.\n\nTrial court alone has authority to allow attorneys fees.Skidmore v. Eby, 1953-NMSC-098, 57 N.M. 669, 262 P.2d 370.\n\n\"Reasonable attorney's fee\".— While the criteria under the Rules of Professional Conduct may, in general, determine the reasonableness of a fee, the court does not set the fee as between the mechanic or materialman and his attorney. Under this section, the court simply allows recovery of a \"reasonable attorney's fee\" from the owner.Ulibarri v. Gee, 1987-NMSC-113, 106 N.M. 637, 748 P.2d 10.\n\nClose scrutiny where amount based on questions collateral to lien.— The reasonableness of the attorney's fee must be closely scrutinized if the amount is based on the defense of counterclaims and other questions collateral to the enforcement of the lien.Lenz v. Chalamidas, 1989-NMSC-067, 109 N.M. 113, 782 P.2d 85.\n\nTime spent as factor in awarding fees.— The trial court's emphasis on time spent as the persuasive factor in awarding attorney fees, especially to an attorney inexperienced in lien foreclosure actions, resulted in an excessive award and was an abuse of discretion.Lenz v. Chalamidas, 1989-NMSC-067, 109 N.M. 113, 782 P.2d 85.\n\nRemand to trial court as to attorneys fees.— On affirmance of judgment foreclosing a lien, the supreme court will not fix attorneys fees for services on appeal, but will remand for allowance by the trial court at its discretion.Mitchell v. McCutcheon, 1927-NMSC-061, 33 N.M. 78, 260 P. 1086.\n\nFindings of fact for attorney fee awards.— In setting attorney fee awards, a trial court must make findings of fact on those factors on which the parties have presented evidence. Without findings of fact and conclusions of law, the supreme court cannot properly perform its reviewing function.Lenz v. Chalamidas, 1989-NMSC-067, 109 N.M. 113, 782 P.2d 85.\n\nAward of attorney fees on appealrequires statutory authority.Alber v.

Carpenter, 1970-NMSC-151,82 N.M. 173, 477 P.2d 807.\n\nAttorneys fees authorized in court of appeals.— Although this statute did not authorize an allowance of attorney fees in the court of appeals, the clear legislative intent was to authorize allowance of attorney fees in the trial and appellate courts. To deny an allowance for attorney fees in this court while authorizing such an allowance in the supreme court would be an absurd result.Measday v. Sweazea, 1968-NMCA-008, 78 N.M. 781, 438 P.2d 525.\n\nAttorneys fees treated as costs.— The language of this section indicates that any allowance made for attorney fees should be as costs, and treated the same as the money paid for filing and recording the lien.Home Plumbing & Contracting Co. v. Pruitt, 1962-NMSC-075, 70 N.M. 182, 372 P.2d 378.\n\nAn invalid lien cannot be the basis for an award of attorney fees.— The use of the word \"must\" in 48-2-6 NMSA 1978, requiring verification by oath, conveys the legislature's setting a mandatory precondition to the lien's validity. In enacting 48-2-6 NMSA 1978, the legislature required some positive affirmation of good faith undertaken upon oath as to the contents of a notice of lien to render any claim thereof valid. Without verification, no lien is created, and cannot provide any basis for action under 48-2-14 NMSA 1978 or attorney fees to be awarded.Sonida, LLC v. Spoverlook, LLC, 2016-NMCA-026.\n\nIn a dispute arising out of or relating to a lien action following a dispute over construction of a house, where plaintiff filed a claim of lien against the home to protect its interests, but where none of the lien documents included any language verifying upon oath the truth of its contents, plaintiff's claims of lien were voidab initiobecause no valid lien was created, and they could not therefore support a foreclosure action on the lien as a matter of law, or provide any basis for action under 48-2-14 NMSA 1978 or attorney fees to be awarded under that statute.Sonida, LLC v. Spoverlook, LLC, 2016-NMCA-026.\n\nSection does not apply to reimbursement of legal fees to subcontractorsin suits against prime contractors for the recovery of work performed.Tyner v. DiPaolo, 1966-NMSC-129, 76 N.M. 483, 416 P.2d 150.\n\nHomeowners not entitled to attorneys fees.— Although this section allows for the award of attorneys fees to successful lien holders, it does not allow recovery of attorneys fees by homeowners. This article is meant to protect lien holders and not homeowners.Tabet Lumber Co. v. Romero, 1994-NMSC-033, 117 N.M. 429, 872 P.2d 847.\n\nNo attorneys fees where no action.— Where no action was filed and no court had exercised its discretion in allowing filing and attorneys fees to a lien claimant, he is not entitled to such fees.Price v. Van Lint, 1941-NMSC-052, 46 N.M. 58, 120 P.2d 611.\n\nAward for defending counterclaim.— Although attorneys fees may be awarded for defending a counterclaim, it should be the exception and not the rule to do so.Hiatt v. Keil, 1987-NMSC-049, 106 N.M. 3, 738 P.2d 121.\n\nAttorney's fee held unreasonable.— This section provides that the fee must be reasonable, and a fee in excess of 300% more than the judgment awarded is patently unreasonable.Hiatt v. Keil, 1987-NMSC-049, 106 N.M. 3, 738 P.2d 121.\n\nLien enforcement suit in equity.— A suit for the enforcement of a mechanic's lien must be brought on the equity side of the court, unless otherwise provided by statute.Ford v. Springer Land Ass'n, 1895-NMSC-011, 8 N.M. 37, 41 P. 541,aff'd, 168 U.S. 513, 18 S. Ct. 170, 42 L. Ed. 562 (1897),overruled on other grounds byFinane v.
