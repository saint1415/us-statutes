Manelos, 337 B.R. 409 (Bankr. D.N.M. 2006).\n\nApplicability of section to owners.— Where final payment was not made, the owners cannot avail themselves of this section.Pyburn v. Kirkpatrick, 1987-NMSC-076, 106 N.M. 247, 741 P.2d 1368.\n\nSubsection A of this section discharges mechanics' and materialmen's liens recorded after the owner has made full payment for construction work performed when the owner has not been given the written notice of potential lien claims prescribed by Subsection B.Sundance Mech. & Util. Corp. v. Armijo, 1987-NMSC-078, 106 N.M. 249, 741 P.2d 1370 (decided under prior law).\n\nThis section imposes no duty upon the owner of a residential building containing four or fewer units to obtain from the original contractor notice or an affidavit as described in Subsection B in order to enjoy the protection from liens provided by Subsection A.Sundance Mech. & Util. Corp. v. Armijo, 1987-NMSC-078, 106 N.M. 249, 741 P.2d 1370 (decided under prior law).\n\nThis section applies to innocent owners only,i.e., owners who had no notice, actual or constructive, of intervening claims by unpaid materialmen.C & D Plumbing, Inc. v. Armstrong, 1987-NMSC-068, 106 N.M. 155, 740 P.2d 705.\n\nApplication to innocent owners.— Where owners had notice that a subcontractor had not been paid by the contractor, the owners are not innocent as to subcontractor's claim of debt, and thus the subcontractor is entitled to recover against the owner for the remaining amount of his claim.Pyburn v. Kirkpatrick, 1987-NMSC-076, 106 N.M. 247, 741 P.2d 1368.\n\nThe words \"all amounts due and owing\"in this section mean final payment, not partial payment.C & D Plumbing, Inc. v. Armstrong, 1987-NMSC-068, 106 N.M. 155, 740 P.2d 705.\n\nPartial payment not sufficient.— The legislature intended to emphasize the rule ofC & D Plumbing, Inc. v. Armstrong, 106 N.M. 155, 740 P.2d 705 (1987) when, in 1989, it amended the language of this section to read \"all and any amounts due and owing\"; that language means payment of all amounts still owing under the original contract is the only way to discharge liens that are subsequently imposed upon the property. Partial payment to the contractor is not sufficient to do so.Wade v. Farnsworth, 1996-NMCA-053, 121 N.M. 698, 917 P.2d 967, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 676, 916 P.2d 1343.\n\nEffect of section on filing deadlines.— Since this section is more specific and more recently enacted than Section 48-2-6 NMSA 1978, it controls to reduce the filing time, where the original contractor has presented his bill for final payment, from 90 to 20 days; and where the owner has paid the original contractor, no subcontractor of whom the owner had no notice of an amount owed may file a lien because of Subsection A of this section.Aztec Wood Interiors, Inc. v. Andrade Homes, Inc., 1986-NMSC-020, 104 N.M. 45, 716 P.2d 236 (decided under prior law).\n\nAbbreviated filing period contingent on notice to subcontractor.— Where no notice was given by the contractor to the subcontractor as required in Subsection B, the 20-day notice requirement of that subsection is not applicable, and a subcontractor is entitled to rely on the 90-day notice provision of Section 48-2-6 NMSA 1978.Pyburn v. Kirkpatrick, 1987-NMSC-076, 106 N.M. 247, 741 P.2d 1368 (decided under prior law).\n\nEffect of escrow account on final payment.— An escrow account set up after the total contract price was paid as a device to ensure the general contractor completed certain punchlist items that did not concern the subcontractor's lien at all did not prevent final payment from occurring under the Stop Notice Act.Tabet Lumber Co. v. Romero, 1994-NMSC-033, 117 N.M. 429, 872 P.2d 847.\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico law relating to property, see 12 N.M.L.
