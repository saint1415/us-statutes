Evans, 245 F.2d 681 (10th Cir. 1957).\n\nSale in excess of lien not conversion as to subordinate mortgagee.— Where a landlord holding a lien under this section, far exceeding in amount the value of all crops raised by tenant, with the latter's consent, either express or implied, takes possession of such crops, harvests and markets same, and applies proceeds toward satisfaction of his lien, he is not guilty of conversion as against a third person holding chattel mortgage on same crops, subordinate to landlord's lien for advancements. And if the landlord is not guilty of conversion, a fortiori his transferee of such crops cannot be.Farmers' Cotton Fin. Corp. v.
