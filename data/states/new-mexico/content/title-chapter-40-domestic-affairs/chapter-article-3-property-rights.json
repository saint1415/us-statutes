      "text": "The property rights of husband and wife are governed by this chapter unless there is a marriage settlement containing stipulations contrary thereto.\n\nHistory:Laws 1907, ch. 37, § 21; Code 1915, § 2772; C.S. 1929, § 68-409; 1941 Comp., § 65-301; 1953 Comp., § 57-3-1.\n\nCross references.— For abolition of curtesy and dower,see45-2-112 NMSA 1978.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The 1915 Code compilers substituted the words \"this chapter\" for the words \"this act.\" The latter referred to Laws 1907, ch. 37, the provisions of which are compiled as 40-2-1, 40-2-2, 40-2-4 to 40-2-9, 40-3-1 to 40-3-3, NMSA 1978, while the former referred to Chapter 55 of the Code, the provisions of which are compiled as 40-4-3, 40-4-4, 40-4-6, 40-4-7, 40-4-20, 40-2-1 to 40-2-9 and 40-3-1 to 40-3-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nLaw of Spain and Mexico as basis for interpretation.— Since the civil law of Spain and Mexico served as the model for the statutory law of this state concerning the property rights of husband and wife, that law will be looked to as the basis for interpretation and definition.McDonald v. Senn, 1949-NMSC-020, 53 N.M. 198, 204 P.2d 990, 10 A.L.R.2d 966.\n\nDissimilarity of estate by entireties and community estate.— There is no similarity between a community estate and an estate by the entireties, except as to the husband and wife feature, and where it has been found necessary to segregate the husband's or wife's interest in community property the courts have found legal principles to justify it.McDonald v. Senn, 1949-NMSC-020, 53 N.M. 198, 204 P.2d 990, 10 A.L.R.2d 966.\n\nAmbiguities in antenuptial contract resolved in wife's favor where drawn by husband.— Where antenuptial contract was drawn by the lawyer-husband and the wife had no independent legal advice, the latter relying upon the husband to correctly reduce their agreement to writing, ambiguities in the agreement should be resolved in her favor.Turley v. Turley, 1940-NMSC-043, 44 N.M. 382, 103 P.2d 113.\n\nOverruling decision could retroactively alter property rights even after husband's death.— Where deficiencies were assessed because New Mexico law forbade a husband and wife from transmuting community property by mere agreement, and their separate property agreement was invalid, the rights of the parties did not become fixed under controlling New Mexico law, at the death of husband, and such rights could be retroactively altered by an overruling decision after his death, and the separate property agreement, under which the husband and wife held their property as tenants in common, was valid and operative from its inception.Massaglia v. Comm'r, 286 F.2d 258 (10th Cir. 1961) (decided under prior law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Community Property - Power of Testamentary Disposition - Inequality Between Spouses,\" see 7 Nat.

Becker, 54 F.2d 542 (10th Cir. 1931).\n\nUltimate effect of transmutation of judgment debtor's propertyfrom a community status to a tenancy in common after divorce is that wife's one-half interest is her separate property, and not subject to levy and execution by judgment creditor.Atlas Corp. v. DeVilliers, 447 F.2d 799 (10th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 933, 92 S. Ct. 939, 30 L. Ed. 2d 809,reh'g denied, 405 U.S. 1033, 92 S. Ct. 1288, 31 L.

Becker, 54 F.2d 542 (10th Cir. 1931).\n\nWife's interest in community property was not of such a character as to give rise, upon her death, to a federal estate tax measured by the value thereof.Hernandez v. Becker, 54 F.2d 542 (10th Cir. 1931).\n\nCommunity is liable for community debtsand there is a presumption that all debts contracted during the marriage are community debts. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen.

Parvilus, 2014-NMSC-028,rev'g2013-NMCA-025, 297 P.3d 1228.\n\nThe plain language of 40-3-3 NMSA 1978renders inter-spousal burglary an impossibility because the New Mexico burglary statutes protect the possessory right to exclude and 40-3-3 NMSA 1978 dictates that spouses have no such right to exclude the other spouse.State v. Parvilus, 2013-NMCA-025, 297 P.3d 1228, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-001.\n\nEntry into residence of estranged spouse.— Where defendant entered defendant's estranged spouse's apartment without permission, kidnapped the victim, and killed the victim, 40-3-3 NMSA 1978 prohibited defendant's spouse form excluding defendant from the spouse's apartment and defendant's entry into the apartment, even with felonious purpose, did not constitute burglary as a matter of law.State v.

Padilla, 1968-NMSC-090, 79 N.M. 245, 442 P.2d 203.\n\nInsurance proceeds are community property even if not divided upon divorce.— Where there is an insured third person (the child) and a spouse (the defendant) as beneficiary and the proceeds were not paid during marriage, but the right to the proceeds was obtained during marriage, this right was not changed and was not divided upon the divorce.Hickson v. Herrmann, 1967-NMSC-083, 77 N.M. 683, 427 P.2d 36.\n\nIf husband owned right to receive proceeds of policy as community propertyof the parties, this right, not having been disposed of by divorce, became the right of the parties as tenants in common.Hickson v.

Except as provided in Subsection C of this section, \"community property\" means property acquired by either or both spouses during marriage which is not separate property. Property acquired by a husband and wife by an instrument in writing whether as tenants in common or as joint tenants or otherwise shall be presumed to be held as community property unless such property is separate property within the meaning of Subsection A of this section.\n\nC. \"Quasi-community property\" means all real or personal property, except separate property as defined in Subsection A of this section, wherever situated, heretofore or hereafter acquired in any of the following ways:\n\n(1) by either spouse while domiciled elsewhere which would have been community property if the spouse who acquired the property had been domiciled in this state at the time of its acquisition; or\n\n(2) in exchange for real or personal property, wherever situated, which would have been community property if the spouse who acquired the property so exchanged had been domiciled in this state at the time of its acquisition.\n\nD.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nRetroactive application of 1984 amendments.— The 1984 amendments to this section apply retroactively so as to convert property acquired by husband and wife as joint tenants prior to the passage of the amendment, and thus originally held as separate property, into community property which would be included in the bankruptcy estate. Property acquired before 1984 by husband and wife through an instrument designating them as joint tenants is presumed to be held as community property, even though it may also be held as joint tenancy property.Swink v. Fingado, 1993-NMSC-013, 115 N.M. 275, 850 P.2d 978.\n\nSection does not deal with how property may be changed to different class;by its terms, it deals with classes of property.Estate of Fletcher v.

Nichols, 1982-NMSC-071, 98 N.M. 322, 648 P.2d 780.\n\nReal estate contract as evidence of intent to transmute.— Although a real estate contract is not conclusive and is not, by itself, substantial evidence on the issue of transmutation of property, it at least constitutes some evidence of intent to transmute.Nichols v. Nichols, 1982-NMSC-071, 98 N.M. 322, 648 P.2d 780.\n\nDuty of trial court is to divide equally community propertyof the spouses and, until the extent of the property of the community has been determined, the trial court is in no position to make a fair and just division.Otto v. Otto, 1969-NMSC-074, 80 N.M. 331, 455 P.2d 642.\n\nThe trial court has a duty to divide the property of the community as equally as possible.Mitchell v. Mitchell, 1986-NMCA-028, 104 N.M. 205, 719 P.2d 432, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 84, 717 P.2d 60.\n\nRelative amounts of separate property and community propertywhich make up the commingled total is an important factor.Conley v. Quinn, 1959-NMSC-065, 66 N.M. 242, 346 P.2d 1030.\n\nProperty takes status as community or separate at time and manner of acquisition.— Property acquired in New Mexico takes its status as community or separate property at the time and by the manner of its acquisition; and if a part of the purchase money is later paid by other funds than those of the owner of the property, whether of the community or an individual spouse, the owner is indebted to the source of such funds in that amount, but such payment does not affect the title of the purchaser.Michelson v. Michelson, 1976-NMSC-026, 89 N.M. 282, 551 P.2d 638;Shanafelt v. Holloman, 1956-NMSC-047, 61 N.M. 147, 296 P.2d 752.\n\nProperty in this state takes its status as community or separate property at the time, and by the manner, of its acquisition.Lucas v. Lucas, 1980-NMSC-123, 95 N.M. 283, 621 P.2d 500;Bustos v. Bustos, 1983-NMSC-074, 100 N.M. 556, 673 P.2d 1289.\n\nProperty takes its distinctive legal title, either as community property or as separate property, at the time it is acquired and is fixed by the manner of its acquisition.English v. Sanchez, 1990-NMSC-064, 110 N.M. 343, 796 P.2d 236.\n\nThe general conflict of laws rule by which an interest in property takes its character at the time and in the manner of its acquisition has not been superseded by the Community Property Act.Blackwell v. Lurie, 2003-NMCA-082, 134 N.M. 1, 71 P.3d 509, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 123, 73 P.3d 826.\n\nSubsequent improvements with community funds does not change status.— Property acquired in New Mexico takes its status as community or separate property at the time and by the manner of its acquisition and subsequent improvement of the premises with community funds does not, of itself, change the nature of the premises, but would only create an indebtedness as between the spouses. Thus, the subsequent erection of improvements on the separate property of the husband with community funds was immaterial to the respective rights of the wife and the bonding company seeking indemnification from the husband for certain amounts paid pursuant to its bonds to the state and at most, would merely give rise to an indebtedness as between the spouses, so that the tract was subject to sale under the attachment of the bonding company.U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Chavez, 126 F. Supp. 227 (D.N.M. 1954)(decided under former law).\n\nApportioning assets between separate and community estates.— It is impossible to lay down hard and fast guidelines in apportioning assets between the separate estate of a conjugal partner and the community; the surrounding circumstances must be carefully considered as each case will depend upon its own facts, and the ultimate answer will call into play the nicest and most profound judgment of the trial court. Mathematical exactness is not expected or required, but substantial justice can be accomplished by the exercise of reason and judgment in all such cases.Michelson v. Michelson, 1976-NMSC-026, 89 N.M. 282, 551 P.2d 638.\n\nApportioning assets.— Apportionment is a legal concept that is properly applied to an asset acquired by married people \"with mixed monies\" - that is, partly with community and partly with separate funds.Dorbin v. Dorbin, 1986-NMCA-114, 105 N.M. 263, 731 P.2d 959.\n\nReimbursement for funds spent for the benefit of separate property.— When community money is spent to the benefit of separate property, without the acquisition of an asset, for example, when money is paid for interest, taxes and insurance, neither New Mexico statute nor case law authorizes reimbursement.Dorbin v. Dorbin, 1986-NMCA-114, 105 N.M. 263, 731 P.2d 959.\n\nIt was error to reimburse to the community both the principal paydown and the amount of interest paid during the marriage which benefited the wife's sole and separate residence.Dorbin v. Dorbin, 1986-NMCA-114, 105 N.M. 263, 731 P.2d 959.\n\nIncludes determining what income amounts due to personal efforts on property employed.— In apportioning assets between a spouse's separate estate and the community each case must be determined with reference to its surrounding facts and circumstances to determine what amount of the income is due to personal efforts of the spouses and what is attributable to the separate property employed; dependent upon the nature of the business and the risks involved, it must be reckoned what would be a fair return on the capital investment as well as determined what would be a fair allowance for the personal services rendered.Michelson v. Michelson, 1976-NMSC-026, 89 N.M. 282, 551 P.2d 638.\n\nInterest in property located in foreign domicile determined by law of situs.— Interests in property acquired in a foreign domicile by the parties during marriage, which property still has its situs in the foreign state at the time of the New Mexico divorce proceedings, are to be determined by the trial court pursuant to the statutes and case law of the foreign state in which the property was acquired.Brenholdt v. Brenholdt, 1980-NMSC-051, 94 N.M. 489, 612 P.2d 1300.\n\nCharacter of retirement pay is determined by law of statewhere it is earned; if earned in a community property state during coverture, it is community property, and if it is earned in a noncommunity property state during coverture, it is separate estate.Otto v. Otto, 1969-NMSC-074, 80 N.M. 331, 455 P.2d 642.\n\nProperty agreement could be retroactively altered even after husband's death.— Where deficiencies were assessed because New Mexico law forbade a husband and wife from transmuting community property by mere agreement, and their separate property agreement was invalid, the rights of the parties did not become fixed under controlling New Mexico law, at the death of husband, and such rights could be retroactively altered by an overruling decision after his death, and the separate property agreement, under which the husband and wife held their property as tenants in common, was valid and operative from its inception.Massaglia v. Commissioner, 286 F.2d 258 (10th Cir. 1961).\n\nIn divorce action, partnership business acquired before marriage, separate property.— In divorce action, supreme court affirmed trial court's division of separate and community property in business partnership acquired by husband prior to marriage, where trial court found that husband's withdrawals from the partnership represented the reasonable value of his services and personal efforts in conduct of the business during the marriage, and thus constituted the total amount attributable to the community, and where such finding was not attacked, wife's contention that trial court erred in certain determinations as to value of the partnership was irrelevant since it had already been established that the business was husband's separate property.Gillespie v. Gillespie, 1973-NMSC-019, 84 N.M. 618, 506 P.2d 775.\n\nAll interests in property conveyed when wife signed quitclaim deed.— In a quiet title action, appellant's contention that a quitclaim deed executed to appellee by her, her husband and cograntees conveyed only her interest as a spouse in community property, that her individual interest as cotenant in common with her husband and the other cograntees was not conveyed, was found to be erroneous. Appellant conveyed all of her interest in the property by the deed and not two separate and distinct estates in the mining property, to-wit, a community property interest and a separate and distinct interest given to married women by the statute.Waddell v. Bow Corp., 408 F.2d 772 (10th Cir. 1969);Stephens v. Stephens, 1979-NMSC-039, 93 N.M. 1, 595 P.2d 1196.\n\nDivision of insurance proceeds where claim pending at divorce.— Where premium on disability insurance proceeds was paid from husband's earnings during marriage, insurance proceeds on claim pending against insurance company at time of divorce were community property.Douglas v. Douglas, 1984-NMCA-071, 101 N.M. 570, 686 P.2d 260.\n\nTenancies by the entirety do not violate public policy.— There is no indication in either the statutes or the case law that the abrogation of tenancies by the entirety by the adoption of the community property system represented a determination that tenancies by the entirety violate some deep-rooted public policy.Blackwell v. Lurie, 2003-NMCA-082, 134 N.M. 1, 71 P.3d 509, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 123, 73 P.3d 826.\n\nCommunity rights generally not forfeited by bigamy.— The mere fact of bigamy is insufficient to deprive wife of her share of community property.Medina v. Medina, 2006-NMCA-042, 139 N.M. 309, 131 P.3d 696.\n\nCircumstances when community rights are forfeited by bigamy.— A bigamous spouse should be deprived of his or her community property rights only when the circumstances of the case shock the conscience of the court.Medina v. Medina, 2006-NMCA-042, 139 N.M. 309, 131 P.3d 696.\n\nII. SEPARATE PROPERTY.\n\nAll property not separate is community.— Property owned by either spouse before marriage or acquired after marriage by gift, bequest, devise or descent, with the rents, issues and profits, is the separate property of that spouse. All other property acquired by either husband or wife or both after marriage is community property.Hollingsworth v. Hicks, 1953-NMSC-045, 57 N.M. 336, 258 P.2d 724 (decided under former law).\n\nDeed naming one spouse raises presumption of separate property.— A deed that names only one spouse does not convey the realty absolutely as separate property, but only creates a presumption of separate property that may be rebutted. Overcoming this presumption by a preponderance of the evidence appears to be sufficient.Sanchez v. Sanchez, 1987-NMCA-143, 106 N.M. 648, 748 P.2d 21, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 627, 747 P.2d 922.\n\nBurden of proof.— If a party alleging that property held in joint tenancy was meant to be separate, to prevail there must be either a clear designation of that intent, or enough evidence to overcome the presumption of community property.Swink v. Sunwest Bank (In re Fingado), 113 Bankr. 37 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1990).\n\nBurden of proving separate property interests.— In a division of property proceeding that resulted from the parties' dissolution of marriage, where husband claimed the district court failed to address husband's claimed interest in a 1955 Chevrolet that wife had given him as a birthday gift, and where husband claimed that wife sold the vehicle without his consent and that he did not receive compensation for the loss of the vehicle, the district court did not err in effectively concluding, by rejecting husband's proposed findings, that husband failed to meet his burden of claiming and proving that he had separate and community property interests in the 1955 Chevrolet, because there was no testimony that wife appropriated or re-gifted the car, that husband did not consent to removal of the car, or that he had never received compensation for it.Gabriele v. Gabriele, 2018-NMCA-042, cert. denied.\n\nAdmissibility of parol evidence to show intent.— Parol evidence was properly admitted, not to alter certain deeds, but rather to establish the true consideration behind the deeds, which, in turn, established the lack of intention of the grantors to make a gift to the wife.Sanchez v. Sanchez, 1987-NMCA-143, 106 N.M. 648, 748 P.2d 21, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 627, 747 P.2d 922.\n\nPresumption of community property where separate cannot be traced.— If separate property has been so commingled or mixed with property acquired after marriage so that the separate property cannot be clearly traced or identified, then there is a presumption that the property acquired after marriage is community property, and not held in joint tenancy, unless this presumption can be overcome by proof.Wiggins v. Rush, 1971-NMSC-092, 83 N.M. 133, 489 P.2d 641.\n\nIntermingling of property.— When separate property has been so intermingled with community property that the separate property cannot be traced or identified, it falls under the presumption of community property. Ability to trace separate funds prevents the determination of the transmutation of property by operation of law; a trial court still has the ability to consider the commingling, along with other evidence, in deciding whether transmutation of separate into community property took place.Nichols v. Nichols, 1982-NMSC-071, 98 N.M. 322, 648 P.2d 780.\n\nEffects of failure to designate separateness.— Since husband and wife acquired dwellings as joint tenants through instruments which did not designate the property as separate property, wife's interest in the proceeds from the properties was included in husband's bankruptcy estate.Swink v. Sunwest Bank, 995 F.2d 175 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nMere commingling of separate property with community property does not change its characterfrom separate to community property, unless the separate property so commingled cannot be traced and identified.Burlingham v. Burlingham, 1963-NMSC-068, 72 N.M. 433, 384 P.2d 699;Corley v. Corley, 1979-NMSC-040, 92 N.M. 716, 594 P.2d 1172.\n\nPresumption of community not followed.— When there is a commingling of a negligible amount of community property with a large amount of separate property so that the separate property can no longer be identified, the general rule that such property falls under the presumption of community property is not followed.Conley v. Quinn, 1959-NMSC-065, 66 N.M. 242, 346 P.2d 1030.\n\nProperty purchased before marriage separate though deed delivered after.— Property purchased by one spouse before marriage is separate property, though the deed therefor is not executed and delivered until after marriage, and this is true though a part of the purchase price is not paid until after the marriage.Hollingsworth v. Hicks, 1953-NMSC-045, 57 N.M. 336, 258 P.2d 724.\n\nPurchase of property prior to marriage.— Husband had equitable title to property prior to his marriage and the property was his separate property, where the property was purchased prior to the marriage and the deed was received by the husband during the marriage.Michaluk v. Burke, 1987-NMCA-044, 105 N.M. 670, 735 P.2d 1176.\n\nCommunity contributions to separate property.— The community is entitled to a lien against the separate property of a spouse for the enhanced value of such property attributable to community labor during the marriage.Jurado v. Jurado, 1995-NMCA-014, 119 N.M. 522, 892 P.2d 969.\n\nExtent of community lien on separate property.— Under New Mexico law, the community is entitled to an equitable lien against separate property only to the extent that the community can show that its funds or labor enhanced the value of the property or increased the equity interest in the property.Martinez v. Block, 1993-NMCA-093, 115 N.M. 762, 858 P.2d 429.\n\nFormula for determining amount of community lien on separate property that has depreciated in value.— When the value of a separate property asset has decreased during the marriage but positive equity remains in the property and the community has paid contributions toward the principal indebtedness against that property, the formula for calculating a community lien is C-[C/B x D], where D is the depreciation in value of the property during the marriage, B is the value on the date of the marriage, and C is the community contributions to principal or market value.Ross v. Negron-Ross, 2017-NMCA-061.\n\nCommunity contributions and improvements to separate property.— Community contributions and improvements to real property do not affect the title of separate ownership; the right of the community to be reimbursed for the amount of the lien does not change the character of the property from separate to community, and separate property may be conveyed by the owner without the joinder of a spouse.Hickey v. Griggs, 1987-NMSC-050, 106 N.M. 27, 738 P.2d 899.\n\nAppreciation equity in separate property.— Where husband, prior to his marriage with wife, purchased a house, and where husband and wife, after marriage, made regular monthly mortgage payments on the property from their joint checking account, and where wife, during the marriage, used her separate funds to pay down the principal on the property, the district court did not err in awarding wife a share in the appreciated equity of the property, because wife was entitled to a share of the increased value of the separate property where she used her separate funds to increase the value the house.Vanderlugt v. Vanderlugt, 2018-NMCA-073.\n\nOwner of separate property responsible for proceeds.— When the owner of separate property participates in its operation to an extent that he may be said to be responsible for a portion of the proceeds arising from it, the proceeds shall then be apportioned as separate and community property.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nOwner of separate property employs others to manage it for him.— If a husband owning property as his sole and separate estate employs others to manage it and does not himself expend any labor, skill or industry upon it, the proceeds of the property must be held to be his separate property.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nIncome on investments as valid measure of separateness.— Under this section income is the demonstrated interest on investments which is a valid measure of the separate income to a husband.Moore v. Moore, 1963-NMSC-047, 71 N.M. 495, 379 P.2d 784.\n\nIncrease in value of separate propertyproduced by natural causes or essentially as a characteristic of the capital investment is separate property.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266;Portillo v. Shappie, 1981-NMSC-119, 97 N.M. 59, 636 P.2d 878.\n\nIncrease in value by community earnings is community property.— The community owns the earning power of each of the spouses, and when that earning power is used for the benefit of one's separate property the portion of the earnings attributable to his personal activities and talent is community property.Portillo v. Shappie, 1981-NMSC-119, 97 N.M. 59, 636 P.2d 878.\n\nThe community is not limited to a lien in the amount of its funds and labor expended in making improvements to realty which was the separate property of plaintiff's deceased wife, but it is entitled to the increase in value of the realty which was directly attributable to the community funds and labor.Portillo v. Shappie, 1981-NMSC-119, 97 N.M. 59, 636 P.2d 878.\n\nMethod of proving value upon apportionment.— Once participation in the operation of separate property is shown, the owner of the separate estate is not limited to its reasonable rental value upon apportionment. Instead, the method of division to be used depends upon what is best under all the proof. It is only when the actual value of the owner's efforts cannot be arrived at that resort may be had to more arbitrary proof of value, such as proof of the value of like services by others, prevailing rental values or interest rates upon investments.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nProperty separately acquired remains so even where improvements made with community funds.— The character of ownership of property, whether separate or community, is determined at the time of its acquisition; if acquired as separate property, it retains such character even though community funds may later be employed in making improvements or discharging an indebtedness thereon.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nProperty acquired after marriage exchanged for property owned before marriage.— Property acquired after marriage in exchange for or with the proceeds from property owned before marriage remains separate property.Conley v. Quinn, 1959-NMSC-065, 66 N.M. 242, 346 P.2d 1030.\n\nCharacter of property exchanged for separate property.— Where there is substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding that the husband's interests in certain property were his separate property, and an interest in a company was received in exchange for a portion of such interests, it necessarily follows the interest in the company is likewise his separate property.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nIntent to transmute necessary.— Separate property can only be held to have been transmuted into community property during the course of a marriage upon a clear showing of intent by the party originally in possession of the property to effect such transmutation; the mere fact that a joint mortgage was taken on the property and that community funds were used to repay the loan is insufficient to effect transmutation, in the absence of a showing of intent.Macias v. Macias, 1998-NMCA-170, 126 N.M. 303, 968 P.2d 814.\n\nSeparate property not transmuted into community property.— Property that was transferred exclusively to the wife, because the husband and wife did not want to subject it to a judgment lien if the husband was sued, was the wife's separate property and was not transmuted into community property by its conveyance to the husband for $2,000 just before they separated, where the property was valued at approximately $160,000, and where the wife was emotionally disturbed, was afraid of her husband, and desperately needed money to help their son pay his bills.Bustos v. Bustos, 1983-NMSC-074, 100 N.M. 556, 673 P.2d 1289.\n\nGift from husband to wife presumed separate estate.— Where the husband purchases real estate with his own or community funds and has the title conveyed to his wife alone, the presumption is that he has made a gift to her and that the property so conveyed is her separate estate. However, this presumption is rebuttable.Overton v. Benton, 1955-NMSC-109, 60 N.M. 348, 291 P.2d 636.\n\nLand purchased during marriage as separate where separate funds used.— Since the source of the funds with which the land was purchased was clearly and indisputably traced and identified as wife's separate property, the fact that the land was purchased during marriage did not alter its status as her separate property.Burlingham v. Burlingham, 1963-NMSC-068, 72 N.M. 433, 384 P.2d 699.\n\nStock dividends.— Dividends from separately invested stock are generally considered rents, issues and profits of the separate estate.Zemke v. Zemke, 1993-NMCA-067, 116 N.M. 114, 860 P.2d 756, cert. denied, 116 N.M. 71, 860 P.2d 201.\n\nIncrease in separate property.— Any increase in the value of separate property is presumed to be also separate unless rebutted by direct and positive evidence that the increase was due to community funds or labor.Zemke v. Zemke, 1993-NMCA-067, 116 N.M. 114, 860 P.2d 756, cert. denied, 116 N.M. 71, 860 P.2d 201.\n\nIncome from husband's investments, owned by him prior to marriage,is his separate property.Moore v. Moore, 1963-NMSC-047, 71 N.M. 495, 379 P.2d 784.\n\nCommunity acquired no investment in husband's business even if money paid during coverture.— Where the husband's interest in business partnership was acquired prior to coverture, it was his separate property, regardless of whether payment was made for it before or after coverture. Even if some portion of the purchase moneys for the interest in the partnership had been paid during coverture, the community would have had no \"investment\" in the business, but merely an equitable lien or charge against it.Gillespie v. Gillespie, 1973-NMSC-019, 84 N.M. 618, 506 P.2d 775.\n\nRecovery for personal injuries of wife as her separate property.— In New Mexico although all real and personal property acquired after marriage by either spouse other than by gift, descent or devise is community property, the courts have held that the cause of action and recovery for personal injuries to the wife are her separate property, so that she may sue in her own name for pain and suffering and personal injuries without joinder of her husband, and her husband's contributory negligence is not imputed to her.Roberson v. U-Bar Ranch, Inc., 303 F. Supp. 730 (D.N.M. 1968).\n\nA victim's claim for personal injuries belonged to him and he could pursue it independent of any marital community, and therefore his administratrix could pursue the personal injury claim as the representative of his estate.Rodgers v. Ferguson, 1976-NMCA-098, 89 N.M. 688, 556 P.2d 844, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619.\n\nWritten agreement to transmute property to joint tenancy not required.— An agreement between spouses to transmute property from community property to joint tenancy does not have to be in writing in all cases.Estate of Fletcher v. Jackson, 1980-NMCA-054, 94 N.M. 572, 613 P.2d 714, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 674, 615 P.2d 991.\n\nRemoving wife's name from accounts by husband does not destroy joint tenancy.— Where certain accounts were owned by husband and wife as joint tenants with right of survivorship, and during wife's incompetency the husband, without the wife's consent or knowledge, transferred the accounts into his name alone and had wife's name removed from other accounts, the actions of the husband did not destroy the joint tenancy and did not convert the property into community property; so, when the husband predeceased the wife, the property succeeded to her as the surviving joint tenant.Bluestein v. Owensby, 1977-NMSC-085, 91 N.M. 81, 570 P.2d 912.\n\nWife's separate property after divorce not subject to judgment creditor.— The ultimate effect of the transmutation of judgment debtor's property from a community status to a tenancy in common after divorce is that wife's one-half interest is her separate property, and not subject to levy and execution by judgment creditor.Atlas Corp. v. DeVilliers, 447 F.2d 799 (10th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 933, 92 S. Ct. 939, 30 L. Ed. 2d 809,reh'g denied, 405 U.S. 1033, 92 S. Ct. 1288, 31 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1972).\n\nRanch owned before marriage is separate property.— Where appellant owns ranch free and clear of all encumbrances prior to the marriage, it belongs to him as his separate property.Moore v. Moore, 1963-NMSC-047, 71 N.M. 495, 379 P.2d 784.\n\nIncome from separate property not necessarily separate.— Merely because a ranch belongs to a husband as his separate property does not mean that the income therefrom is his separate property.Moore v. Moore, 1963-NMSC-047, 71 N.M. 495, 379 P.2d 784.\n\nVeteran's interest in his V.A. disability pensionis characterized as his separate property since his entitlement thereto accrued prior to his marriage. Therefore, the community property laws do not give his spouse a protectable property interest in the pension.Sena v. Roudebush, 442 F. Supp. 153 (D.N.M. 1977).\n\nOffspring of husband's separately owned horses constitutes \"rents, issues and profits thereof\"and are separate property.Corley v. Corley, 1979-NMSC-040, 92 N.M. 716, 594 P.2d 1172.\n\nNondisability military retirement pay is separate property.— Nondisability military retirement pay is the separate property of the spouse who is entitled to receive it, and it is not subject to division upon dissolution of marriage.Espinda v. Espinda, 1981-NMSC-098, 96 N.M. 712, 634 P.2d 1264, superseded byWalentwoski v. Walentowski, 1983-NMSC-097, 100 N.M. 484, 672 P.2d 657.\n\nBurden of proving value of improvements made by community effort.— Real property acquired by a husband prior to marriage, and paid for during the marriage with monies from his retirement disability pension, was separate property. Thus, where the wife failed to show the amount by which community labor or funds enhanced the value of the property, the trial court's decision to apportion some of the proceeds of the sale of the property to the community was not supported by the record.Bayer v. Bayer, 1990-NMCA-106, 110 N.M. 782, 800 P.2d 216, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 749, 799 P.2d 1121.\n\nForgiveness of loan by will of parent.— When a parent has loaned money to a child and the child's spouse for the purchase of real property, and then the parent dies, leaving a will forgiving debts owed by the child to the parent, courts have interpreted the will provision in question to forgive the entire amount of the debt, even though the debt was a joint debt and the spouse was not mentioned in the will.Martinez v. Block, 1993-NMCA-093, 115 N.M. 762, 858 P.2d 429.\n\nIII. COMMUNITY PROPERTY.\n\nHybrid community ownership.— The joint tenancy designation on a deed issued to a marital couple establishes a presumption that the marital couple holds the property in hybrid community property ownership. Property held in this manner is distinguishable from pure community property only in that each member of the marital couple has joint tenancy survivorship benefits in the community property.In re Beery, 295 B.R. 385 (2003).\n\nLimited purpose for which income considered community property.— New Mexico's community property law only considers a spouse's income as property of the other spouse for the purpose of distributing assets in the case of a divorce or legal separation, not to determine the equality of wages under the federal Equal Pay Act. Consistent with this reasoning is the fact that half of a husband's salary is not attributed to his wife for the purposes of determining his wife's social security, workers' compensation, or unemployment benefits.Dean v. United Food Stores, Inc., 767 F. Supp. 236 (D.N.M. 1991).\n\nProperty held in joint tenancy can be community property.Swink v. Sunwest Bank (In re Fingado), 113 Bankr. 37 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1990).\n\nRebuttable presumption that income is community.— There is a rebuttable presumption that income received by either party during their marriage is community property.Moore v. Moore, 1963-NMSC-047, 71 N.M. 495, 379 P.2d 784.\n\nIn divorce action where supreme court is shown no evidence adduced at the trial which will defeat the presumption that income received from a ranch during marriage is community property, the supreme court will treat that income as income of the community.Moore v. Moore, 1963-NMSC-047, 71 N.M. 495, 379 P.2d 784.\n\nProperty acquired by either or both spouses during their marriageis presumptively community property. The presumption of community property, however, is subject to being rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.Stroshine v. Stroshine, 1982-NMSC-113, 98 N.M. 742, 652 P.2d 1193.\n\nBurden of proof of rebuttal.— Property acquired by either or both spouses during their marriage is presumptively community property. A party asserting that such property is separate has the burden of presenting evidence that would rebut the presumption by a preponderance of the evidence.Nichols v. Nichols, 1982-NMSC-071, 98 N.M. 322, 648 P.2d 780.\n\nWife failed to rebut the presumption that property acquired during the marriage was community property.— In a divorce proceeding, where wife appealed the district court's characterization of assets and debts as separate or community property and the court's division of marital assets and debts between her and husband, the district court did not err in determining that the parties' business was community property and not wife's separate property, because the district court's decision was supported by evidence in the record, including wife's failure to support her testimony with any documentation that gift of $2,000 was used to start the business, that the $2,000 amount was unlikely to have been sufficient to fund the launch of a corporation engaged in heavy earth-moving, and undisputed evidence that husband was involved from the outset in every aspect of creating and running the corporation. Wife failed to rebut the presumption that property acquired during the marriage was community property.Autrey v. Autrey, 2022-NMCA-042, cert. granted.\n\nBurden of proving community property interests.— In a division of property proceeding that resulted from the parties' dissolution of marriage, where husband claimed a community interest in a property located in Texas where husband and wife co-signed a note in order for wife's daughter to purchase the Texas property, the down payment of which was paid by the daughter, and where husband and wife eventually deeded the house to the daughter, and where husband testified that he did not know the source of the funds used for the down payment for the Texas property, there was substantial evidence to support the district court's finding that the parties had no real community interest in the Texas property.Gabriele v. Gabriele, 2018-NMCA-042, cert. denied.\n\nExpended earnings not subject to distribution.— In a division of property proceeding that resulted from the parties; dissolution of marriage, where husband claimed that wife converted community assets to her own use and that the community is entitled to reimbursement for the value of those assets, the district court did not err by not distributing wife's income earned during the marriage, because once community earnings are expended, rather than being converted into an asset, there is no community asset to be shared or managed, and the spouse making the expenditure has no duty to reimburse the community absent some special circumstance, and in this case there was no evidence to support husband's theory that wife converted her earnings during the marriage into community assets that would be available for distribution.Gabriele v. Gabriele, 2018-NMCA-042, cert. denied.\n\nIf the parties remarried after a divorcedecree brought an end to the marital community, a new community was created, and military benefits earned during the parties' second marriage came within the purview of Subsection B and were community property.Pacheco v. Quintana, 1986-NMCA-007, 105 N.M. 139, 730 P.2d 1, cert. quashed, 105 N.M. 94, 728 P.2d 845.\n\nTransmutation into community property must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.— Once the community property presumption is overcome by a preponderance of the evidence, a party must prove the transmutation of the separate property into community property by clear and convincing evidence.Nichols v. Nichols, 1982-NMSC-071, 98 N.M. 322, 648 P.2d 780.\n\nEvidence that property has been transmuted from separate to community property must be by clear, strong and convincing proof.Mitchell v. Mitchell, 1986-NMCA-028, 104 N.M. 205, 719 P.2d 432, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 84, 717 P.2d 60.\n\nInterest of each member of community is existing interest,and not merely an expectancy.U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Chavez, 126 F. Supp. 227 (D.N.M. 1954).\n\nWhen commingling of funds beneficial to community.— In a divorce action if the community's expenditure of funds exceed the income, then any commingling of funds is to the benefit of the community rather than to the detriment of the community.Corley v. Corley, 1979-NMSC-040, 92 N.M. 716, 594 P.2d 1172.\n\nJoint tenancy not created where community funds used to purchase.— Because it was not the intention of husband and wife to hold the property as joint tenants, and because community funds were used to purchase the property, the trial court properly concluded that a joint tenancy was not created.Wiggins v. Rush, 1971-NMSC-092, 83 N.M. 133, 489 P.2d 641.\n\nRealty purchased after marriage deemed community property.— Where realty, though in the name of the husband, is purchased after marriage, it qualifies as community property, and the wife's interest in the property is equal to one-half of the equity.Robnett v. N.M. Dep't of Human Servs. Income Support Div., 1979-NMCA-099, 93 N.M. 245, 599 P.2d 398.\n\nProceeds under covenant not to compete are not community property.— The proceeds under a covenant not to compete negotiated as part of the sale of a business are not community property within the community property laws of this state, where the forthcoming payments were not included in the valuation of the stock and were to be received after divorce.Lucas v. Lucas, 1980-NMSC-123, 95 N.M. 283, 621 P.2d 500.\n\nMedical license not community property.— For purposes of community property laws, a medical license is not community property because it cannot be the subject of joint ownership.Muckleroy v. Muckleroy, 1972-NMSC-051, 84 N.M. 14, 498 P.2d 1357.\n\nNegligence of one spouse will be imputed to other.— New Mexico follows the rule that where a cause of action for negligence belongs to the community, negligence of one spouse will be imputed to and bar recovery by the other spouse.Roberson v. U-Bar Ranch, Inc., 303 F. Supp. 730 (D.N.M. 1968).\n\nClaim of spouse for medical expenses belong to community.— A claim for damages to the community for medical expenses and loss of earnings, if any, of the husband or wife belong to the community since if the injury deprives the marital community of the earnings or services of the spouse, that is an injury to the marital community, and likewise there is a loss to the community where the community funds are expended for hospital and medical expenses, etc. Since the husband is usually the breadwinner, contributing definite earnings, the loss to the marital community resulting from an injury to him is more obvious.Rodgers v. Ferguson, 1976-NMCA-098, 89 N.M. 688, 556 P.2d 844, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619.\n\nWhere medical expenses were community assets, any part of the wife's tort settlement intended to reimburse the community for medical expenses was also community property. It makes no difference whether the debt was paid with cash or with insurance proceeds; in any event, it was paid by the community.Russell v. Russell, 1987-NMCA-085, 106 N.M. 133, 740 P.2d 127.\n\nCommunity does not acquire interest in corporation.— Where the husband was paid for his services to a corporation in which he owned a one-half interest, which salary of course belonged to the community, and there was no proof in the record that the salary was not adequate or reasonable under the circumstances, having started at $7,500 in 1964 when he returned from college and increased to $35,000 in 1972, the trial court erred in concluding that the community had acquired an interest in the corporation.Michelson v. Michelson, 1976-NMSC-026, 89 N.M. 282, 551 P.2d 638.\n\nInterest in spouse's share in professional corporation.— A nonshareholder spouse cannot be awarded an interest, including goodwill, in a professional corporation greatly in excess of the husband's contractual withdrawal rights. The value of goodwill must be determined without dependency upon the professional spouse's potential or continuing income.Hertz v. Hertz, 1983-NMSC-004, 99 N.M. 320, 657 P.2d 1169.\n\nValue of professional practice as community property.— Although the individual right to practice a profession is a property right that cannot be classed as a community property, the value of the practice as a business at the time of dissolution of the community is community property.Mitchell v. Mitchell, 1986-NMCA-028, 104 N.M. 205, 719 P.2d 432, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 84, 717 P.2d 60.\n\nCommunity lien not disturbed.— Where the only separate funds of the husband used in the family home was the sum paid for the lot upon which it was constructed, and the evidence showed that the parties expended a considerable sum on the home after its completion (although whether community or separate funds were used for that purpose was unclear), that a few mortgage payments were made from community funds, that refinancing of the mortgage was accomplished by a note and mortgage signed by both the husband and wife and that the community credit was pledged thereby, and that both parties expended considerable time and effort in making improvements, and there was no attempt to trace the separate funds of the husband into the expenditures for the home after completion, the trial court's conclusion that the community had a lien of the one half of the difference between the original land price and the mortgage balance attributable to community expenditures of time, effort and money (as opposed to normal appreciations) would not be disturbed.Michelson v. Michelson, 1976-NMSC-026, 89 N.M. 282, 551 P.2d 638.\n\nCourt to know extent of community property in determining alimony and child support.— Trial court should know the extent of the community property in making a determination as to alimony and child support.Otto v. Otto, 1969-NMSC-074, 80 N.M. 331, 455 P.2d 642.\n\nTransfer of one-half interest community property upon death subject to federal estate tax.— Certainly by any standard plaintiff's husband had at least a one-half interest in the community property during his lifetime, and it was his free choice and his determination that upon his death such interest should become the property of his widow, the plaintiff; since upon his death his one-half interest in the community estate was transferred to the plaintiff, this property was subject to the federal estate tax.Hurley v. Hartley, 255 F. Supp. 459 (D.N.M. 1966),aff'd, 379 F.2d 205 (10th Cir. 1967).\n\nLife insurance.— Where a third party is the insured and a spouse the beneficiary, the ownership of the policy proceeds paid to the spouse during marriage is determined by the general community property law.Hickson v. Herrmann, 1967-NMSC-083, 77 N.M. 683, 427 P.2d 36.\n\nInsurance settlement proceeds acquired after dissolution of marriage.— Following divorce proceedings, where wife filed a motion to impose a constructive trust on insurance proceeds that husband received after filing a bad faith claim against his insurance company for denying a property damage claim related to his truck, arguing that the insurance proceeds were community property because the truck was community property and the insurance policy covering the truck was paid for with community funds, and where husband argued that the settlement proceeds were not a community asset because the settlement occurred after the dissolution of marriage and that wife was not entitled to any of the insurance proceeds because wife's actions played a significant part in the decision by the insurance company to wrongfully deny husband's property damage claim under his automobile insurance policy, the district court erred in granting husband's motion for summary judgment, because insurance proceeds that are paid as a result of a policy that is community property, where that policy was paid for with community funds, are community property, and there was nothing in the record permitting a reasonable inference that wife acted with tortious intent or motive to deprive the community of a community asset.Martinez v. Martinez, 2017-NMCA-032.\n\nVacation and sick leave.— A spouse's unused vacation leave and unused sick leave are community property and are divisible upon divorce.Arnold v. Arnold, 2003-NMCA-114, 134 N.M. 381, 77 P.3d 285.\n\nMilitary retirement benefits.— Military retirement benefits are community property.Walentowski v. Walentowski, 1983-NMSC-097, 100 N.M. 484, 672 P.2d 657,superseding Espinda v. Espinda, 1981-NMSC-098, 96 N.M. 712, 713 P.2d 1264,reinstating LeClert v. LeClert, 1969-NMSC-049, 80 N.M. 235, 453 P.2d 755.\n\nMilitary retirement pay.— The rule ofLeClert v. LeClert, 1969-NMSC-049, 80 N.M. 235, 453 P.2d 755 that military retirement pay is community property has been reinstated in New Mexico, and applies to those final judgments entered prior to the decision inMcCarty v. McCarty, 453 U.S. 210, 101 S. Ct. 2728, 69 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1981). The Uniform Services Former Spouses' Protection Act 10 U.S.C. § 1408 (c)(1) applies retroactively only to judgments which were final after the announcement of theMcCartyopinion on June 26, 1981.Norris v. Saueressig, 1986-NMSC-024, 104 N.M. 76, 717 P.2d 52.\n\nDisability retirement pay is community propertyfor purposes of distribution of property upon dissolution of marriage.Stroshine v. Stroshine, 1982-NMSC-113, 98 N.M. 742, 652 P.2d 1193.\n\nPension plan.— The community's interest in a pension plan that is vested but unmatured is the amount of benefits earned during coverture.Mattox v. Mattox, 1987-NMCA-021, 105 N.M. 479, 734 P.2d 259.\n\nMedical benefits.— United States civil service medical retirement benefits are community property.Luxton v. Luxton, 1982-NMSC-087, 98 N.M. 276, 648 P.2d 315.\n\nValuation of pension benefits.— In dividing community property, pension benefits should be valued using monthly benefit which husband received at time of divorce since increases coming after the date of the divorce are the husband's separate property.Madrid v. Madrid, 1984-NMCA-066, 101 N.M. 504, 684 P.2d 1169.\n\nAbsent an express agreement by the parties to the contrary, the only retirement penalties to be imposed against the nonemployee spouse's share of the pension being distributed pursuant to a pay-as-it-comes-in method are those penalties that were actually applied to calculate the employee spouse's pension benefits, and not any hypothetical penalties.Franklin v. Franklin, 1993-NMCA-077, 116 N.M. 11, 859 P.2d 479, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 795, 858 P.2d 1274.\n\nConveyance to husband and wife presumed as community.— A conveyance of real property to a husband and wife, by deed describing them as husband and wife, gives rise to a presumption that the property is taken by them as community property. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-70 (rendered under former law).\n\nCommunity property \"is not liable for contracts of wife,made after marriage\". The statute, as we construe it, means the wife's separate contracts as well as those attempted to be made by her for the community while the husband is the manager of the community, or her separate contracts in the event she would be substituted as head of the community. 1956 Op.

      "text": "A. \"Separate debt\" means:\n\n(1) a debt contracted or incurred by a spouse before marriage or after entry of a decree of dissolution of marriage;\n\n(2) a debt contracted or incurred by a spouse after entry of a decree entered pursuant to Section 40-4-3 NMSA 1978, unless the decree provides otherwise;\n\n(3) a debt designated as a separate debt of a spouse by a judgment or decree of any court having jurisdiction;\n\n(4) a debt contracted by a spouse during marriage which is identified by a spouse to the creditor in writing at the time of its creation as the separate debt of the contracting spouse;\n\n(5) a debt which arises from a tort committed by a spouse before marriage or after entry of a decree of dissolution of marriage or a separate tort committed during marriage; or\n\n(6) a debt declared to be unreasonable pursuant to Section 2 [40-3-10.1 NMSA 1978] of this act.\n\nB. \"Community debt\" means a debt contracted or incurred by either or both spouses during marriage which is not a separate debt.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 57-4A-3, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 320, § 4; 1983, ch. 75, § 1.\n\nPurpose.— Subsection A is directed mainly toward relations between couples and their creditors. The legislature did not intend to restrict the courts' ability to practice fairness as between two spouses.Fernandez v. Fernandez, 1991-NMCA-001, 111 N.M. 442, 806 P.2d 582.\n\nRequirement of written notice to creditor.— The main purpose of Subsection A(4), requiring written notice to the creditor, is to protect creditors who might be unaware that spouses do not intend to create a community debt. As between spouses, however, it is not as necessary to require strict compliance with the statute. Where there is evidence that spouses do not intend the debt to be community and take steps to ensure it is not, a court may find this substantial compliance sufficient to declare the debt separate as between the spouses.Fernandez v. Fernandez, 1991-NMCA-001, 111 N.M. 442, 806 P.2d 582.\n\nThe fundamental purpose behind the written notice requirement of Subsection A(4) is to protect creditors who might be unaware that the debtor spouse intends to create a separate debt, rather than a community debt.Huntington Nat'l Bank v. Sproul, 1993-NMSC-051, 116 N.M. 254, 861 P.2d 935.\n\nThreshold questionof whether item is community or separate debt is a legal issue.Bursum v. Bursum, 2004-NMCA-133, 136 N.M. 584, 102 P.3d 651, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-003, 137 N.M. 290, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nRemainder of wife's attorney's fees not considered community debt.— The district court could reasonably have ruled that the remainder of wife's attorney fees, while stipulated to be reasonable in amount for the work done, was unreasonably incurred and therefore would not be considered community debt.Bursum v. Bursum, 2004-NMCA-133, 136 N.M. 584, 102 P.3d 651, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-003, 137 N.M. 290, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nFiduciary duty.— Each spouse owes the other a fiduciary duty when managing community property. This fiduciary duty limits a spouse's ability to enter into any transaction in which he or she might wish to engage, without fear of subsequent liability to the other spouse.Fernandez v. Fernandez, 1991-NMCA-001, 111 N.M. 442, 806 P.2d 582.\n\nWife's estate not liable for loss in public office.— Where no attempt was made to show that defendant's wife was in any way responsible for the loss appearing in the records of her husband's public office, her separate estate was not liable for her husband's separate obligations.U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Chavez, 126 F. Supp. 227 (D.N.M. 1954).\n\nWife's estate exempt from attachment proceedings.— The entire community estate of the defendant and his wife was not subject to his indebtedness, where the wife, so far as the record showed, had no knowledge of any shortage on the part of her husband, nor did she give her consent thereto, or ratify the acts, if any, of her husband, which resulted in the shortage, and neither did the shortage benefit the community estate, so far as was shown; therefore, the vested estate of the wife (intervenor) in and to the community property tracts was exempt from the attachment proceedings instituted by the bonding company, and the community interest of the husband was subject to sale under the attachment, inasmuch as his shortages created a separate liability on his part, resulting in a judgment against him.U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Chavez, 126 F. Supp. 227 (D.N.M. 1954).\n\nSeparate debt.— At least as between the parties to a divorce, and under certain circumstances, a debt may be classified as separate even if it was incurred while the parties lived together and even though it may not meet the strict requirements of Subsection A.Fernandez v. Fernandez, 1991-NMCA-001, 111 N.M. 442, 806 P.2d 582.\n\nEvidence supported a determination that the parties attempted to arrange a loan as a separate debt instead of a community debt, where the husband knew that the wife would not participate in the transaction and that she did not want any community assets included, the mortgage securing the loan explicitly stated that the husband was a married man dealing in his sole and separate property, and the wife testified that the creditor asked her to sign documents disclaiming any interest in the collateral.Fernandez v. Fernandez, 1991-NMCA-001, 111 N.M. 442, 806 P.2d 582.\n\nUnderlying obligation represented by a fraudulently executed promissory note was a separate debt of the wife, and the proceeds received did not benefit the community, where the wife committed fraud against her husband by allowing her brother to impersonate her husband and forge his name on financial documents.Beneficial Fin. Co. v. Alarcon, 1991-NMSC-074, 112 N.M. 420, 816 P.2d 489.\n\nHusband may have separate credit and debt.— While the credit of the husband belongs presumptively to the community, still he may contract a separate debt based upon his separate credit and assets acquired in that manner are his separate property.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nDetermination whether tort debt of community or spouse.— This section leaves to the courts the problem of determining whether a tort committed by a spouse during marriage is a \"community\" or a \"separate\" tort. Under the rule followed in most community property states, the test to be applied in such cases is an after-the-fact determination of whether the act in which the spouse was engaged at the time of the tort was one which was of actual or potential benefit to the community. If it was of benefit, the tort is a \"community\" tort, and thus a community debt, to be collected under the provisions of 40-3-11 NMSA 1978.Dell v. Heard, 532 F.2d 1330 (10th Cir. 1976).\n\nIn determining the issue of whether a tort committed by a spouse is a \"community\" or a \"separate\" tort, the test to be applied is an after-the-fact determination of whether the act in which the spouse was engaged at the time of the tort was one which was of actual or potential benefit to the community; if it was of benefit, the tort is a \"community\" tort, and thus a community debt; if the activity in which the tortfeasor spouse was engaged was of no benefit to the community, the tort is a \"separate\" tort and thus a separate debt.Delph v. Potomac Ins. Co., 1980-NMSC-140, 95 N.M. 257, 620 P.2d 1282.\n\nIt is inappropriate to enter a judgment against one spouse solely because the other spouse has committed a community tort. Such a judgment could readily create confusion, because the judgment ordinarily could not be executed against the separate property of the spouse who was not the tortfeasor.Naranjo v. Paull, 1990-NMCA-111, 111 N.M. 165, 803 P.2d 254.\n\nThere is no reason why the same court that hears a tort case could not concurrently decide whether the tort was a community tort, at least when both spouses are defendants. Such a proceeding should not be foreclosed just because the plaintiff may also have the option of waiting until execution on the judgment to litigate whether the tort was a community tort.Naranjo v. Paull, 1990-NMCA-111, 111 N.M. 165, 803 P.2d 254.\n\nHusband's breach of listing agreement subjected community to debts without wife's concurrence.— The fact that, upon the breach of a real estate listing agreement by the husband, the listing agent can bring suit, obtain a judgment and levy on the property without the wife's signature on the agreement is not violative of this section, inasmuch as a husband can subject the community to certain debts without the concurrence of his wife.Execu-Systems v. Corlis, 1980-NMSC-121, 95 N.M. 145, 619 P.2d 821.\n\nAttorney's fees incurred due to child visitation issues from previous marriage.— Chapter 7 debtor-husband was liable for attorney's fees incurred by spouse in connection with child visitation issues from a previous marriage, as spouse's debt was incurred as a community debt.In re Strickland, 153 Bankr. 909 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1993).\n\nTrial court's finding of separate property upheld.— The trial court, upon dissolution of a marriage, has a duty to determine whether debts and obligations incurred by the parties during coverture are community or separate debts; the trial court's finding assigning income tax liability and intervenor's claim as husband's separate debts would not be disturbed where husband had failed to demonstrate on appeal that the trial court's ruling was unsupported by substantial evidence, nor had husband shown that he requested a finding of fact on this issue, and wife's counsel had also failed to provide authority for the merits of her discussion on this issue.Fenner v. Fenner, 1987-NMCA-066, 106 N.M. 36, 738 P.2d 908, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 7, 738 P.2d 125.\n\nPresumption that debt of the community.— In New Mexico, there is a presumption that debt incurred by a married person is community debt.Swink v. Sunwest Bank (In re Fingado), 113 Bankr. 37 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1990).\n\nAs a general rule, one spouse may incur a community debt even though the other spouse does not participate in the transaction.Fernandez v. Fernandez, 1991-NMCA-001, 111 N.M. 442, 806 P.2d 582.\n\nAs between a spouse and the other spouse's creditor, Subsection A(4) requires that the debtor spouse expressly communicate the separate nature of a marital debt to a creditor in writing when creating a marital debt intended to be that spouse's separate obligation, and since the defendant debtor was unable to point to any written provision in the note or to any other written agreement between himself and the creditor bank that identified the debt as his own separate obligation, the debt remained a community debt.Huntington Nat'l Bank v. Sproul, 1993-NMSC-051, 116 N.M. 254, 861 P.2d 935.\n\nPresumption that debt of the community.— The community is liable for community debts and there is a presumption that all debts contracted during the marriage are community debts. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-37 (rendered under former law).\n\nCommunity not obligated for support of spouse's parent.— In terms, at least, no obligation is placed on the child and his or her spouse to support their parents. The ultimate effect of the former statute may be exactly this, but not because the obligation, as created, invests it with this character. Further, it is not an obligation which is incurred for the benefit of the community. It cannot be said that the discharge of this obligation in any direct manner enhances, or is intended to enhance, the interest of the community. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6499 (rendered under former law).\n\nOnly husband's share of community subject to his separate tort.— Upon the question of recovery from the community property for an obligation based on the husband's separate tort, it would seem that not the whole of the community, but only his share therein, could be subjected to payment. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6499 (rendered under former law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Community Property Act of 1973: A Commentary and Quasi-Legislative History,\" see 5 N.M.L.

There was no evidence in the record that established the essential elements of a breach of fiduciary duty, a lack of consent by wife, or even the amount of the separate debt, necessary to establish a right of reimbursement.Autrey v.

      "text": "A. The separate debt of a spouse shall be satisfied first from the debtor spouse's separate property, excluding that spouse's interest in property in which each of the spouses owns an undivided equal interest as a joint tenant or tenant in common. Should such property be insufficient, then the debt shall be satisfied from the debtor spouse's one-half interest in the community property or in property in which each spouse owns an undivided equal interest as a joint tenant or tenant in common, excluding the residence of the spouses. Should such property be insufficient, then the debt shall be satisfied from the debtor spouse's interest in the residence of the spouses, except as provided in Subsection B of this section or Section 42-10-9 NMSA 1978. Neither spouse's interest in community property or separate property shall be liable for the separate debt of the other spouse.\n\nB. Unless both spouses join in writing in the creation of the underlying debt or obligation incurred after the marriage, a judgment or other process arising out of such post-marital debt against one spouse alone or both spouses shall not create a lien or otherwise be subject to execution against the interest of the nonjoining spouse in the marital residence, whether held by the spouses as community property, joint tenants or tenants in common.\n\nC. The priorities or exemptions established in this section for the satisfaction of a separate debt must be claimed by either spouse under the procedure set forth in Section 42-10-13 NMSA 1978, or the right to claim such priorities or exemptions is waived as between a spouse and the creditor.\n\nD. This section shall apply only while both spouses are living and shall not apply to the satisfaction of debts after the death of one or both spouses.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 57-4A-4, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 320, § 5; 1975, ch. 246, § 3; 1995, ch. 184, § 1.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, substituted \"Subsection B of this section or Section 42-10-9 NMSA 1978\" for \"Section 24-6-1 NMSA 1953\", added Subsection B, redesignated former Subsections B and C as Subsections C and D, and substituted \"42-10-13-NMSA 1978\" for \"24-7-1 NMSA 1953\" in Subsection C.\n\nWife's interest in community can be segregated and subjected to lien.— The public policy of the state of New Mexico on the subject of community property does not preclude a holding that the wife's vested interest in community real property can be segregated and subjected to a statutory judgment lien for a personal tort committed by the wife during the coverture.U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Chavez, 126 F. Supp. 227 (D.N.M. 1954).\n\nDebt satisfied from community property.— A spouse's separate Arizona debt may be satisfied from that spouse's half interest in community funds in New Mexico.National Bank of Ariz. v. Moore, 2005-NMCA-122, 138 N.M. 496, 122 P.3d 1265, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-010, 138 N.M. 494, 122 P.3d 1263.\n\nPower to manage and control and actual availability of entire community personal property distinguished.— Although 40-3-14 NMSA 1978 gives either spouse alone the full power to manage, control, dispose of and encumber the entire community personal property, there exists a distinction between the power to manage and control and actual availability. Since this section provides that a spouse's one-half interest in the community property is available to satisfy his or her separate debts, it does not necessarily follow that the power given by 40-3-14 NMSA 1978 makes the entire community personal property always available to each spouse.Herrera v. Health & Soc. Servs., 1978-NMCA-118, 92 N.M. 331, 587 P.2d 1342, cert. deniedsub nom. Human Servs. Dep't v. Herrera, 92 N.M. 353, 588 P.2d 554 (1978).\n\nSeparate tort where activity no benefit to community.— If the activity in which the tort-feasor spouse was engaged was of no benefit to the community, the tort is a \"separate\" tort, collectible only as a separate debt under this section.Dell v. Heard, 532 F.2d 1330 (10th Cir. 1976).\n\nWife's separate estate not liable for loss in husband's public office.— Where no attempt was made to show that defendant's wife was in any way responsible for the loss appearing in the records of her husband's public office, her separate estate was not liable for her husband's separate obligations.U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Chavez, 126 F. Supp. 227 (D.N.M. 1954).\n\nWife's estate exempt from attachment proceedings.— The entire community estate of the defendant and his wife was not subject to his indebtedness, where the wife, so far as the record showed, had no knowledge of any shortage on the part of her husband, nor did she give her consent thereto, or ratify the acts, if any, of her husband, which resulted in the shortage, and neither did the shortage benefit the community estate, so far as was shown; therefore, the vested estate of the wife (intervenor) in and to the community property tracts was exempt from the attachment proceedings instituted by the bonding company, and the community interest of the husband was subject to sale under the attachment, inasmuch as his shortages created a separate liability on his part, resulting in a judgment against him.U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Chavez, 126 F. Supp. 227 (D.N.M. 1954).\n\nNo cause of action against husband by wife's judgment creditor.— Where judgment creditor of wife who committed tort in family car brought suit against husband and argued his cause of action was for an after-the-fact determination that wife's tort was a community tort which rendered the husband's separate property liable for satisfaction of the judgment debt, the court believed the issues presented by appellant under the community property laws did not set forth a cause of action against husband but would be determined if and when judgment creditor proceeded to execute on property belonging to husband.Dell v. Heard, 532 F.2d 1330 (10th Cir. 1976).\n\nOne-half of husband's income garnishable for wife's debts.— Considering the wife's vested one-half interest in all of the community property, findings that the creditor had exhausted the possibilities of recovering the debt from wife's separate property, and that husband's income was community property, the trial court correctly concluded that one-half of husband's income from garnishee was available to satisfy wife's debt to creditor.Central Adjustment Bureau, Inc. v. Thevenet, 1984-NMSC-083, 101 N.M. 612, 686 P.2d 954.\n\nJoinder of joint payee spouses in garnishment proceeding.— Where husband is judgment debtor and the judgment of the trial court in a garnishment proceeding indicates that garnishee is indebted on a promissory note to husband and wife, if the note is not a community asset, both payees under the note should be joined so as to adjudicate their respective rights under the note, but if the note is a community asset, wife would be considered a proper but not indispensable party.Jemko, Inc. v. Liaghat, 1987-NMCA-069, 106 N.M. 50, 738 P.2d 922.\n\nAid to child denied where claim based on mother's interest in community income.— For purposes of determining aid to families with dependent children benefits, where a wife not only has a technical income resulting from her one-half share in the community income, but that one-half share in the community income provides the legal basis for her daughter's legitimate claim on the one-half interest in the community income, the denial of benefits for the child, on the basis that the mother's income exceeded permissible limits, is upheld.Duran v. N.M. Dep't of Human Servs., 1980-NMCA-038, 95 N.M. 196, 619 P.2d 1240.\n\nIntentional action of one spouse may not bar insurance recovery by other.— The intentional burning of a community residence by one spouse will not bar recovery by an innocent spouse for her interest under a fire insurance policy issued to the community.Delph v.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nProperty takes status as community or separate at time and by manner of acquisition.— Property acquired in New Mexico takes its status as community or separate property at the time and by the manner of its acquisition; and if a part of the purchase money is later paid by other funds than those of the owner of the property, whether of the community or an individual spouse, the owner is indebted to the source of such funds in that amount, but such payment does not affect the title of the purchaser.Shanafelt v. Holloman, 1956-NMSC-047, 61 N.M. 147, 296 P.2d 752.\n\nJudicial estoppel did not apply to prevent spouse from claiming community property where it was not established that she successfully argued or assumed property was separate before the district court.— Where husband died intestate, survived by his wife, and where wife, appointed as sole personal representative of husband's estate, claimed a community lien against a tract of husband's land (west tract) due to improvements made to the property while wife was married to husband, and where wife also exercised her claim for a spousal allowance and a personal property allowance against the west tract, and where petitioner objected to any allowances against any property identified as separate property, and where wife passed away prior to a trial scheduled to resolve the issues, and where respondent, the personal representative of wife's estate, filed for partial summary judgment to establish that the west tract was held by husband and wife as community property, and where petitioner argued that the district court should judicially estop respondent from claiming the west tract as community property because wife took the position that the west tract was separate property earlier in the probate proceedings, the district court did not abuse its discretion when declining to apply judicial estoppel, because it was not established that respondent or wife successfully argued or assumed that the west tract was separate property in a motion or at a hearing before the district court where the nature of the property was at issue.In re Estate of Kuchan, 2024-NMCA-032.\n\nProof of transmutation.— Transmutation is a general term used to describe arrangements between spouses to convert property from separate property to community property and vice versa. While transmutation is recognized, the party alleging the transmutation must establish the transmutation of property to community property by clear, strong and convincing proof.Allen v. Allen, 1982-NMSC-118, 98 N.M. 652, 651 P.2d 1296.\n\nWife was indispensable party in action brought by husband to quiet titleto realty deeded to both husband and wife.Brown v. Gurley, 1954-NMSC-025, 58 N.M. 153, 267 P.2d 134.\n\nDeed with no description of marital status created tenancy in common.— A quitclaim deed conveying land to a husband and wife by name and address but with no description of marital status created a tenancy in common; the address appearing after their names was not sufficient to express any other intention.U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Chavez, 126 F. Supp. 227 (D.N.M. 1954).\n\nAdmissibility of parol evidence to show intent.— Parol evidence was properly admitted, not to alter certain deeds, but rather to establish the true consideration behind the deeds, which, in turn, established the lack of intention of the grantors to make a gift to the wife.Sanchez v. Sanchez, 1987-NMCA-143, 106 N.M. 648, 748 P.2d 21, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 627, 747 P.2d 922.\n\nRequirements for overcoming presumption of fraud in community property conveyance.— The burden was on husband's heirs to overcome the presumption of fraud in action to nullify conveyance of community property for fraud. They were required to show: (a) payment of an adequate consideration; (b) full disclosure to the wife as to her rights and the value and extent of the community property; and (c) that the wife had competent and independent advice in conferring the benefits upon her husband.Trujillo v. Padilla, 1968-NMSC-090, 79 N.M. 245, 442 P.2d 203.\n\nBurden upon contestant asserting separate character.— The party seeking to rebut the presumption of community property has the burden of introducing factual evidence that the disputed property meets a criterion of separate property as defined in 40-3-8 NMSA 1978.C & L Lumber & Supply, Inc. v. Texas Am. Bank/Galeria, 1990-NMSC-056, 110 N.M. 291, 795 P.2d 502.\n\nProperty acquired during marriage is presumed to be community propertyand if community funds are used to purchase the separate property of either spouse, such property becomes community property.Marquez v. Marquez, 1973-NMSC-084, 85 N.M. 470, 513 P.2d 713.\n\nPresumption.— In New Mexico, there is a clearly stated presumption of community property.Swink v. Sunwest Bank (In re Fingado), 113 Bankr. 37 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1990).\n\nThe presumption of community property arises from the naked fact that it was acquired during marriage.Hollingsworth v. Hicks, 1953-NMSC-045, 57 N.M. 336, 258 P.2d 724.\n\nProperty acquired during marriage by either spouse is presumed to be community property. The recitation in a deed not signed by both spouses that the property is the \"sole and separate property\" of a married man does not affect this presumption.C & L Lumber & Supply, Inc. v. Texas Am. Bank/Galeria, 1990-NMSC-056, 110 N.M. 291, 795 P.2d 502.\n\nProperty acquired by either or both spouses during their marriage is presumptively community property. The presumption of community property, however, is subject to being rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.Stroshine v. Stroshine, 1982-NMSC-113, 98 N.M. 742, 652 P.2d 1193.\n\nPresumption part of Spanish property law.— The presumption that all property acquired after marriage is community property was part of Spanish community property law and was recognized as an element of the community property system in this state prior to the time of its statutory pronouncement by Laws 1907, ch. 37, § 10 (now repealed and replaced by what are now 40-3-8 and 40-3-12(A) NMSA 1978).Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nII. PRESUMPTION OF COMMUNITY PROPERTY.\n\nDivision of insurance proceeds where claim pending at divorce.— Where premium on disability insurance proceeds was paid from husband's earnings during marriage, insurance proceeds on claim pending against insurance company at time of divorce were community property.Douglas v. Douglas, 1984-NMCA-071, 101 N.M. 570, 686 P.2d 260.\n\nInsurance proceeds on policy paid for with community funds.— Following divorce proceedings, where wife filed a motion to impose a constructive trust on insurance proceeds that husband received after filing a bad faith claim against his insurance company for denying a property damage claim related to his truck, arguing that the insurance proceeds were community property because the truck was community property and the insurance policy covering the truck was paid for with community funds, and where husband argued that the settlement proceeds were not a community asset because the settlement occurred after the dissolution of marriage and that wife was not entitled to any of the insurance proceeds because wife's actions played a significant part in the decision by the insurance company to wrongfully deny husband's property damage claim under his automobile insurance policy, the district court erred in granting husband's motion for summary judgment, because insurance proceeds that are paid as a result of a policy that is community property, where that policy was paid for with community funds, are community property.Martinez v. Martinez, 2017-NMCA-032.\n\nVacation and sick leave.— A spouse's unused vacation leave and unused sick leave are community property and are divisible upon divorce.Arnold v. Arnold, 2003-NMCA-114, 134 N.M. 381, 77 P.3d 285.\n\nDisability retirement pay is community propertyfor purposes of distribution of property upon dissolution of marriage.Stroshine v. Stroshine, 1982-NMSC-113, 98 N.M. 742, 652 P.2d 1193.\n\nFederal civil service disability benefits.— To the extent the community contributed, a husband's future federal civil service disability benefits are community property subject to division upon dissolution of a marriage.Hughes v. Hughes, 1981-NMSC-110, 96 N.M. 719, 634 P.2d 1271.\n\nGeneral presumption of community property is certainly not conclusive.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nBurden upon contestant asserting separate character.— The contestant asserting the separate character of the property has not only the burden of going forward with his evidence, but of establishing separate ownership by a preponderance of evidence.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nIt is settled law in New Mexico that property acquired in this state during coverture is presumptively community property, and one asserting it to be separate estate has the burden of establishing such fact by a preponderance of the evidence.Mounsey v. Stahl, 1956-NMSC-110, 62 N.M. 135, 306 P.2d 258.\n\nPresumption does not obtain if intention other than community expressed.— Where property is acquired by husband and wife by an instrument in writing in which they are described as such, the presumption as to community property does not obtain if a different intention is expressed in the instrument.Shanafelt v. Holloman, 1956-NMSC-047, 61 N.M. 147, 296 P.2d 752.\n\nShowing that community earning exceeded community expenses,even though the excess be slight, supports a finding of community property.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nRelative amounts of separate property and community property which make up commingled totalis an important factor.Conley v. Quinn, 1959-NMSC-065, 66 N.M. 242, 346 P.2d 1030.\n\nWhere commingled with large amount of separate property.— When there is a commingling of a negligible amount of community property with a large amount of separate property so that the separate property can no longer be identified, the general rule that such property falls under the presumption of community property is not followed.Conley v. Quinn, 1959-NMSC-065, 66 N.M. 242, 346 P.2d 1030.\n\nPreponderance of evidence needed to overcome presumption.— Proof to overcome the presumption of community ownership need only amount to a preponderance of the evidence.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nWhere the acquisition of property is involved, the presumption of community property may be overcome by a preponderance of evidence.Shanafelt v. Holloman, 1956-NMSC-047, 61 N.M. 147, 296 P.2d 752;Hughes v. Hughes, 1981-NMSC-110, 96 N.M. 719, 634 P.2d 1271.\n\nThe presumption that property acquired after marriage is community property is rebutted when the separate character of the property in question is proved by a preponderance of the evidence in the trial court.Conley v. Quinn, 1959-NMSC-065, 66 N.M. 242, 346 P.2d 1030 (decided under former law).\n\nThe presumption that property acquired during marriage is community property may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.Mitchell v. Mitchell, 1986-NMCA-028, 104 N.M. 205, 719 P.2d 432, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 84, 717 P.2d 60;Arch, Ltd. v. Yu, 1988-NMSC-101, 108 N.M. 67, 766 P.2d 911.\n\nWarranty deeds conveying joint title.— Introduction of warranty deeds conveying title to husband and wife was sufficient to establish prima facie that the real estate was held as community property.Arch, Ltd. v. Yu, 1988-NMSC-101, 108 N.M. 67, 766 P.2d 911.\n\nPresumption still has force and effect after testimony to rebut.— It cannot be said that upon the mere introduction of testimony to rebut the presumption of community property that the presumption is no longer to be considered of any force and effect.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nSubstantial evidence needed to uphold presumption on appeal.— When evidence in the case casts doubt upon the issue, a finding of community ownership will be upheld as supported by substantial evidence. In counterpart, when the evidence of separate ownership is clear and no evidence aside from the presumption exists to the contrary, circumstantial or otherwise, a finding of community ownership should be overturned upon appeal as not supported by substantial evidence.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nUpon appeal the question whether the presumption of community property has been overcome as a matter of law depends upon whether there is substantial evidence to support the finding of the trial court. The cases are numerous which hold the substantial evidence rule applies in such case, as does the usual appellate rule of indulging all presumptions in favor of the judgment.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nPresumption not rebutted.— The words and conduct of a disingenuous spouse in misrepresenting that real estate was his separate property were not sufficient to rebut a presumption that property was held as a community interest.Arch, Ltd. v. Yu, 1988-NMSC-101, 108 N.M. 67, 766 P.2d 911.\n\nWife failed to rebut the presumption that property acquired during the marriage was community property.— In a divorce proceeding, where wife appealed the district court's characterization of assets and debts as separate or community property and the court's division of marital assets and debts between her and husband, the district court did not err in determining that the parties' business was community property and not wife's separate property, because the district court's decision was supported by evidence in the record, including wife's failure to support her testimony with any documentation that gift of $2,000 was used to start the business, that the $2,000 amount was unlikely to have been sufficient to fund the launch of a corporation engaged in heavy earth-moving, and undisputed evidence that husband was involved from the outset in every aspect of creating and running the corporation. Wife failed to rebut the presumption that property acquired during the marriage was community property.Autrey v. Autrey, 2022-NMCA-042, cert. granted.\n\nIII. SEPARATE PROPERTY.\n\nProperty acquired with independent funds as separate.— When it is established that community funds equal or fall short of community expenditures, property acquired by the husband, having independent funds at his disposal, should be held, by legitimate inference, to be his separate property.Campbell v. Campbell, 1957-NMSC-001, 62 N.M. 330, 310 P.2d 266.\n\nDeed naming one spouse raises presumption of separate property.— A deed that names only one spouse does not convey the realty absolutely as separate property, but only creates a presumption of separate property that may be rebutted. Overcoming this presumption by a preponderance of the evidence appears to be sufficient.Sanchez v. Sanchez, 1987-NMCA-143, 106 N.M. 648, 748 P.2d 21, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 627, 747 P.2d 922.\n\nEarnings of wife belong to community where working for husband's partnership.Dale v. Dale, 1953-NMSC-081, 57 N.M. 593, 261 P.2d 438.\n\nBurden of proving nature and value of improvements made to separate property.— Real property acquired by a husband prior to marriage, and paid for during the marriage with monies from his retirement disability pension, was separate property. Thus, where the wife failed to show the amount by which community labor or funds enhanced the value of the property, the trial court's decision to apportion some of the proceeds of the sale of the property to the community was not supported by the record.Bayer v. Bayer, 1990-NMCA-106, 110 N.M. 782, 800 P.2d 216, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 749, 799 P.2d 1121.\n\nWhere origin of property preceded marriage presumption no longer prevails.— When, upon the exhibition of the whole title, it appears that the origin of property preceded the marriage, and that it was separate property, the presumption no longer prevails.Hollingsworth v. Hicks, 1953-NMSC-045, 57 N.M. 336, 258 P.2d 724.\n\nPreponderance of evidence needed to overcome presumption.— The contestant asserting the separate character of property has not only the burden of going forward with the evidence, but of establishing separate ownership by a preponderance of the evidence.White v. White, 1987-NMCA-032, 105 N.M. 600, 734 P.2d 1283.\n\nSeparate property must be traceable and identifiable.— If separate property has been so intermingled with community property that it cannot be traced or identified, the evidence of separate status is insufficient to overcome the presumption of community property.Mitchell v. Mitchell, 1986-NMCA-028, 104 N.M. 205, 719 P.2d 432, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 84, 717 P.2d 60.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment on Thaxton v. Thaxton, 75 N.M. 450, 405 P.2d 932 (1965), see 6 Nat.

      "text": "A. Except for purchase-money mortgages and except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the spouses must join in all transfers, conveyances or mortgages or contracts to transfer, convey or mortgage any interest in community real property and separate real property owned by the spouses as cotenants in joint tenancy or tenancy in common. The spouses must join in all leases of community real property or separate real property owned by the spouses as cotenants in joint tenancy or tenancy in common if the initial term of the lease, together with any option or extension contained in the lease or provided for contemporaneously, exceeds five years or if the lease is for an indefinite term.\n\nAny transfer, conveyance, mortgage or lease or contract to transfer, convey, mortgage or lease any interest in the community real property or in separate real property owned by the spouses as cotenants in joint tenancy or tenancy in common attempted to be made by either spouse alone in violation of the provisions of this section shall be void and of no effect, except that either spouse may transfer, convey, mortgage or lease directly to the other without the other joining therein.\n\nExcept as provided in this section, either spouse may transfer, convey, mortgage or lease separate real property without the other's joinder.\n\nB. Nothing in this section shall affect the right of one of the spouses to transfer, convey, mortgage or lease or contract to transfer, convey, mortgage or lease any community real property or separate real property owned by the spouses as cotenants in joint tenancy or tenancy in common without the joinder of the other spouse, pursuant to a validly executed and recorded power of attorney as provided in Section 47-1-7 NMSA 1978. Nothing in this section shall affect the right of a spouse not joined in a transfer, conveyance, mortgage, lease or contract to validate an instrument at any time by a ratification in writing.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 57-4A-7, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 320, § 8; 1975, ch. 246, § 5; 1993, ch. 165, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For necessity of joinder of spouses in contracts of indemnity,see40-3-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, made stylistic changes in Subsection A; and in Subsection B, substituted \"47-1-7 NMSA 1978\" for \"70-1-6 NMSA 1953\" at the end of the first sentence and added the second sentence.\n\nEffect of transfer to partnership.— Once community property is contributed to a partnership, its status is not transmuted from community to separate or partnership property. Although the community no longer has a right to the specific piece of property the community still has an interest. The community merely trades its interest in the specific asset for a community interest in the partnership.Dotson v. Grice, 1982-NMSC-072, 98 N.M. 207, 647 P.2d 409.\n\nConflict between this section and 14-9-3 NMSA 1978should be resolved in favor of the latter statute which protects the rights of innocent purchasers for value without notice of unrecorded instruments.Jeffers v. Martinez, 1979-NMSC-083, 93 N.M. 508, 601 P.2d 1204;Jeffers v. Doel, 1982-NMSC-116, 99 N.M. 351, 658 P.2d 426.\n\nNo limit on who may claim benefit.— This section is directed at the conveyance itself and not at the identity of the person claiming the conveyance is void. It contains no limitations regarding for whose benefit it may be used.C & L Lumber & Supply, Inc. v. Texas Am. Bank/Galeria, 1990-NMSC-056, 110 N.M. 291, 795 P.2d 502.\n\nHusband and wife must join in all deeds and mortgagesaffecting community real property.Pickett v. Miller, 1966-NMSC-050, 76 N.M. 105, 412 P.2d 400.\n\n\"Join in\" means \"sign\".— Under this section a contract for the sale of an interest in community real property, which has not been signed by both husband and wife, is unenforceable, void and of no effect absent a validly executed and recorded power of attorney, because the words \"join in\" as used in this section mean \"sign\".Hannah v. Tennant, 1979-NMSC-009, 92 N.M. 444, 589 P.2d 1035.\n\nNeither husband nor wife can transfer real property without the other.— As the court construes the section by its plain terms at the present time, neither husband nor wife can make a transfer or conveyance of the real property of the community without the other joining in such conveyance or transfer, and if such transfer or conveyance is attempted of such real property of the community by either husband or wife alone, such transfer or conveyance is void, and of no effect.Marquez v. Marquez, 1973-NMSC-084, 85 N.M. 470, 513 P.2d 713.\n\nSignatures of both spouses required.— Contracts to transfer an interest in community real property are void and of no effect unless signed by both husband and wife.Hannah v. Tennant, 1979-NMSC-009, 92 N.M. 444, 589 P.2d 1035.\n\nFederal coal leasesare real community property, and a husband cannot effectively convey them without his wife's signature.Padilla v. Roller, 1980-NMSC-037, 94 N.M. 234, 608 P.2d 1116.\n\nJoining of both spouses.— If both spouses do not join, an attempt by one spouse to transfer, convey or mortgage community real property is void.Swink v. Sunwest Bank (In re Fingado), 113 Bankr. 37 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1990).\n\nSection not applicable to executory contract to sell community.— The failure of seller's wife to sign does not render agreement void or unenforceable, but was sufficient where she was named in the agreement and was ready, willing and able to convey her community interest. This section, requiring the wife to sign deeds and mortgages affecting community property, has no application to an action for damages on the husband's executory contract for the sale of community realty, and it is immaterial whether the action is by the vendor or the vendee.Pickett v. Miller, 1966-NMSC-050, 76 N.M. 105, 412 P.2d 400.\n\nCommunity contributions and improvements to separate property.— Community contributions and improvements to real property do not affect the title of separate ownership; the right of the community to be reimbursed for the amount of the lien does not change the character of the property from separate to community, and separate property may be conveyed by the owner without the joinder of a spouse.Hickey v. Griggs, 1987-NMSC-050, 106 N.M. 27, 738 P.2d 899.\n\nNo specific performance where wife not joined.— A contract purporting to sell community real estate would not be ordered to be specifically performed where the wife did not join in the husband's agreement to sell.Pickett v. Miller, 1966-NMSC-050, 76 N.M. 105, 412 P.2d 400.\n\nRequirements to overcome presumption of fraud in community conveyance.— The burden was on husband's heirs to overcome the presumption of fraud in action to nullify conveyance of community property for fraud. They were required to show (a) payment of an adequate consideration; (b) full disclosure to the wife as to her rights and the value and extent of the community property; and (c) that the wife had competent and independent advice in conferring the benefits upon her husband.Trujillo v. Padilla, 1968-NMSC-090, 79 N.M. 245, 442 P.2d 203.\n\nInvalidity of contract as affirmative defense.— A contract's invalidity under this section, which states that a contract to sell land held in joint tenancy by a husband and wife is void unless the wife either signs the contract or gives the husband a power of attorney to sell the land, is an affirmative defense which the defendant bears the burden of proving by showing that he made some effort to ascertain the existence of the power of attorney.Otero v. Buslee, 695 F.2d 1244 (10th Cir. 1982).\n\nSpouse's failure to sign bank note did not preclude subsequent encumbrance.— Subsection A should not be construed to require both spouses to join in creating a community debt merely because a later judgment on the debt might encumber community real property. To the extent that New Mexico common law suggests otherwise, those decisions are overruled. Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it ordered the judicial sale of the spouse's residence to satisfy the creditor bank's judgment on note defaulted on by the husband individually.Huntington Nat'l Bank v. Sproul, 1993-NMSC-051, 116 N.M. 254, 861 P.2d 935.\n\nEffect of one spouse's signature on promissory notecan do no more than commit his separate property and his share of the community personal property to repayment of the obligation stated in the note because he is without power to encumber the community real property for its repayment without the other spouse's joinder.Shadden v. Shadden, 1979-NMCA-078, 93 N.M. 274, 599 P.2d 1071, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 172, 598 P.2d 215;overruled byHuntington Nat'l Bank v. Sproul, 1993-NMSC-051, 116 N.M. 254, 861 P.2d 935.\n\nRegardless of the wording of a guaranty contract, unless his wife joins in the execution of the guaranty, a husband can only encumber his own separate property and his share of the community real property.First State Bank v. Muzio, 1983-NMSC-057, 100 N.M. 98, 666 P.2d 777,overruled byHuntington Nat'l Bank v. Sproul, 1993-NMSC-051, 116 N.M. 254, 861 P.2d 935.\n\nFraudulently executed promissory note.— Underlying obligation represented by a fraudulently executed promissory note was a separate debt of the wife, and the proceeds received did not benefit the community, where the wife committed fraud against her husband by allowing her brother to impersonate her husband and forge his name on financial documents.Beneficial Fin. Co. v. Alarcon, 1991-NMSC-074, 112 N.M. 420, 816 P.2d 489.\n\nAggrieved party's remedies limited where contract void for lack of spouse's signature.— Where an option contract to convey community property is void for lack of one spouse's signature, the aggrieved party may not obtain specific performance or damages for breach of contract.Sims v. Craig, 1981-NMSC-046, 96 N.M. 33, 627 P.2d 875.\n\nAlternative remedies.— Where the aggrieved party may not sue on a contract to convey community property because it is void for failure to join one spouse, an action for negligent misrepresentation may be maintained.Sims v. Craig, 1981-NMSC-046, 96 N.M. 33, 627 P.2d 875.\n\nAlthough misrepresentation of the legal status of property could be grounds for other theories of recovery than breach of contract, plaintiff could not maintain an action for damages on either a real estate exchange agreement or its addendum because they were void and unenforceable under this section.Arch, Ltd. v. Yu, 1988-NMSC-101, 108 N.M. 67, 766 P.2d 911.\n\nEffect on after-acquired property.— An otherwise valid and fully enforceable real estate sales contract, executed by a single spouse, was not rendered wholly void under Subsection A because the asset later was acquired by the community. The contract was void as to after-acquired community property, but was valid as to the after-acquired real estate when it was transmuted and owned by the seller as his separate estate.English v. Sanchez, 1990-NMSC-064, 110 N.M. 343, 796 P.2d 236.\n\nSection is inapplicable to conveyance of separate property.— Where husband and wife, prior to husband's death, entered into a sole and separate property agreement that transmuted the couple's community property to husband's separate property, and where husband then executed a reverse mortgage transaction on this separate property, which was assigned to plaintiff mortgage company, and where husband subsequently re-conveyed the property back to husband and wife, and where, after husband's death, plaintiff filed a complaint seeking a judgment foreclosing on its security interest in wife's property pursuant to the reverse mortgage, the district court erred in granting wife's motion for summary judgment on the basis that the reverse mortgage executed by husband was void because wife did not execute it as well, because the sole and separate property agreement transmuted the property into husband's separate property and he had authority to unilaterally grant a mortgage. The reverse mortgage was not void pursuant to this section.Nationstar Mort. LLC v. O'Malley, 2018-NMCA-029, cert. denied.\n\nCommunity debt to be paid from community funds even after divorce.— A community debt incurred prior to the dissolution of the marital community, and for the benefit thereof, would properly be payable out of \"community\" funds notwithstanding the fact that such community property had been transmuted into separate property by virtue of a decree of divorce.Moucka v. Windham, 483 F.2d 914 (10th Cir. 1973).\n\nSignatures on loan commitment, not on contract.— Without more, the signature of both spouses on a loan commitment is insufficient to overcome the affirmative defense that both spouses did not execute the actual contract conveying real property.Arch, Ltd. v. Yu, 1988-NMSC-101, 108 N.M. 67, 766 P.2d 911.\n\nWhere wife did not join mineral deed and evidence did not show separate purchase.— Where plaintiff claimed predecessor's prior mineral deed to another was void for failure of predecessor's wife to join in deed, the burden of the prior grantee of showing by preponderance of evidence that interest in question was purchased with separate funds and not community property was not met and deed was void.Mounsey v. Stahl, 1956-NMSC-110, 62 N.M. 135, 306 P.2d 258.\n\nEasement agreement void where wives not joined.— Where 1918 agreement between married men purports to establish easement rights in community property without having their respective wives join therein is void under this section, use of such easement until 1959 is permissive.Batts v. Greer, 1963-NMSC-037, 71 N.M. 454, 379 P.2d 443.\n\nQuitclaim deeds not proper where wife did not join agreement to sell.— Proposed agreement to shift the property lines of the parties executed by quitclaim deeds is clearly improper since both the husband and the wife must join in all deeds and mortgages affecting community real property and a contract purporting to sell community real estate will not be ordered specifically performed where the wife did not join the husband's agreement to sell.Sanchez v. Scott, 1973-NMSC-115, 85 N.M. 695, 516 P.2d 666.\n\nReal estate listing agreement not transfer of community property.— A real estate listing agreement is not a transfer, conveyance, mortgage or contract to transfer, convey or mortgage community property within the meaning of this section.Execu-Systems v. Corlis, 1980-NMSC-121, 95 N.M. 145, 619 P.2d 821.\n\nHusband's breach of listing agreement subjected community to debts without wife's concurrence.— The fact that, upon the breach of a real estate listing agreement by the husband, the listing agent can bring suit, obtain a judgment and levy on the property without the wife's signature on the agreement is not violative of this section, inasmuch as a husband can subject the community to certain debts without the concurrence of his wife.Execu-Systems v. Corlis, 1980-NMSC-121, 95 N.M. 145, 619 P.2d 821.\n\nPresumption not rebutted.— The words and conduct of a disingenuous spouse in misrepresenting that real estate was his separate property were not sufficient to rebut a presumption that property was held as a community interest.Arch, Ltd. v. Yu, 1988-NMSC-101, 108 N.M. 67, 766 P.2d 911.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment on Thaxton v. Thaxton, 75 N.M. 450, 405 P.2d 932 (1965), see 6 Nat.

Except as provided in Subsections B and C of this section, either spouse alone has full power to manage, control, dispose of and encumber the entire community personal property.\n\nB. Where only one spouse is:\n\n(1) named in a document evidencing ownership of community personal property; or\n\n(2) named or designated in a written agreement between that spouse and a third party as having sole authority to manage, control, dispose of or encumber the community personal property which is described in or which is the subject of the agreement, whether the agreement was executed prior to or after July 1, 1973; only the spouse so named may manage, control, dispose of or encumber the community personal property described in such a document evidencing ownership or in such a written agreement.\n\nC. Where both spouses are:\n\n(1) named in a document evidencing ownership of community personal property; or\n\n(2) named or designated in a written agreement with a third party as having joint authority to dispose of or encumber the community personal property which is described in or the subject of the agreement, whether the agreement was executed prior to or after July 1, 1973; both spouses must join to dispose of or encumber such community personal property where the names of the spouses are joined by the word \"and.\" Where the names of the spouses are joined by the word \"or,\" or by the words \"and/or,\" either spouse alone may dispose of or encumber such community personal property.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 57-4A-8, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 320, § 10; 1975, ch. 246, § 6.\n\nPower to manage community property.— Either spouse may dispose of community property unless the disposition violates the spouse's fiduciary duty to the other spouse; the fiduciary duty in question involves the assessment of the equities of the particular circumstances, and in assessing the equities, a court should consider whether the disposition furthers both spouses' common benefit and whether the disposition amounted to a substantial portion of the community property.Khalsa v. Puri, 2015-NMCA-027, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere wife requested reallocation of her late husband's half of community property due to his alleged excess expenditure of community funds prior to his death, the challenged expenditures, consisting of expenses for family trips, payments to family members, expenses incurred during visits with guests, medical expenses, and payments for religious services, were properly held to be beneficial to the community, in part because wife failed to provide evidence that she lacked knowledge of or did not consent to such expenditures; other charitable contributions were held to be reasonable because they were not excessive compared to the value of the entire community estate.Khalsa v. Puri, 2015-NMCA-027, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nPower to manage and control and actual availability of entire community personal property distinguished.— Although this section gives either spouse alone the full power to manage, control, dispose of and encumber the entire community personal property, there exists a distinction between the power to manage and control and actual availability. Since 40-3-10 NMSA 1978 provides that a spouse's one-half interest in the community property is available to satisfy his or her separate debts, it does not necessarily follow that the power given by this section makes the entire community personal property always available to each spouse.Herrera v. Health & Soc. Servs., 1978-NMCA-118, 92 N.M. 331, 587 P.2d 1342, cert. deniedsub nom. Human Servs. Dep't v.

Sproul, 1993-NMSC-051, 116 N.M. 254, 861 P.2d 935.\n\nAbility of each spouse to manage and control business partnership.— Where the income tax returns are filed as a partnership and where the wife occasionally accompanies her husband and assists him with job-related demonstrations although the wife is not employed by her husband's company, they are engaged in business as a marital partnership in which each has full power alone to manage and control the business.Amador v. Lara, 1979-NMCA-129, 93 N.M. 571, 603 P.2d 310.\n\nCommunity loss recovered by wife as \"head of the household.\"— Where a wife brings an action to recover for personal injuries and other damages sustained in an automobile accident, she alone may recover damages for her physical injury, pain and suffering, and she has the right to recover the entire community loss as the \"head of the household\" with full power to manage and control personal community property.Amador v. Lara, 1979-NMCA-129, 93 N.M. 571, 603 P.2d 310.\n\nTestator's separate and community personal estate as obligor to promissory note.— Where a testator included in his will a promissory note payable to himself from himself, his separate and community personal estate became substituted as the obligor on the note and his beneficiary became the obligee.In re Estate of Shadden, 1979-NMCA-078, 93 N.M. 274, 599 P.2d 1071, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 172, 598 P.2d 215,overruled on other grounds byHuntington Nat'l Bank v. Sproul, 1993-NMSC-051, 116 N.M. 254, 861 P.2d 935.\n\nSubsequent marriage no invalidation of decedent's power to designate mother as beneficiary.— In an action by an employee's widow who claims entitlement to all death benefits under a health benefits plan, although the decedent made his mother the beneficiary, the decedent's power to designate his mother as beneficiary of all of the death benefits was not invalidated by his subsequent marriage or by the community property law.Barela v. Barela, 1980-NMCA-157, 95 N.M. 207, 619 P.2d 1251.\n\nRevocation of gift.— Each spouse has the power to manage and dispose of the community's personal property, subject to a fiduciary duty to the other spouse, and absent intervening equities, a gift of substantial community property to a third person without the other spouse's consent may be revoked and set aside for the benefit of the aggrieved spouse.Roselli v. Rio Cmtys. Serv. Station, Inc., 1990-NMSC-018, 109 N.M. 509, 787 P.2d 428.\n\nWhere the husband had consented to neither the wife's removal of community funds from a joint account prior to the parties' separation nor to the wife's gift of the funds to their two daughters, the husband was entitled to recover his share of the gifts from the wife's property.Fernandez v. Fernandez, 1991-NMCA-001, 111 N.M. 442, 806 P.2d 582.\n\nPayment of life insurance policy premiumswith community funds results in a community property interest in policy proceeds.Roselli v. Rio Cmtys. Serv. Station, Inc., 1990-NMSC-018, 109 N.M. 509, 787 P.2d 428.\n\nExpended earnings not subject to distribution.— Since the expenditures of the spouses' earnings and other community funds during a period of separation were not shown to be contrary to any court order or in violation of a fiduciary duty owed by one party to the other, the trial court erred in making its apportionment of community assets by awarding the husband funds which no longer existed and then allowing the wife an offsetting award out of other existing community property.Irwin v. Irwin, 1996-NMCA-007, 121 N.M. 266, 910 P.2d 342.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment on Thaxton v. Thaxton, 75 N.M. 450, 405 P.2d 932 (1965), see 6 Nat.

If a spouse disappears and his location is unknown to the other spouse, the other spouse may, not less than thirty days after such disappearance, file a petition setting forth the facts which make it desirable for the petitioning spouse to engage in a transaction for which joinder of both spouses is required by Section 40-3-13 NMSA 1978 or to manage, control, dispose of or encumber community personal property which the disappearing spouse alone has sole authority to manage, control, dispose of or encumber under Section 40-3-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. The petition shall be filed in a district court of any county in which real property described in the petition is located or, if only community personal property is involved, in the district court of the county where the disappearing spouse resided.\n\nC. The district court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the spouse who has disappeared and shall allow a reasonable fee for his services.\n\nD. A notice, stating that the petition has been filed and specifying the date of the hearing, accompanied by a copy of the petition, shall be issued and served on the guardian ad litem and shall be published once each week for four successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the proceeding is pending.

Moreover, the district court's finding that defendant could obtain a loan by providing her unencumbered house as collateral was supported by the record, the district court complied with the statute and guidelines by considering hardship in determining whether to impose a fine, and the district court did not rely on clearly erroneous facts in finding that defendant's family had known about her drug activity and that defendant's house was connected to her drug activity.United States v.
