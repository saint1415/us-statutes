Galadriel R., 2009-NMCA-007, 145 N.M. 500, 201 P.3d 169, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-012, 145 N.M. 571, 203 P.3d 102.\n\n\"Extraordinary circumstances\" construed.— Where grandmother sought kinship guardianship of her twelve-year-old granddaughter after the unexpected death of the child's mother, alleging that there were extraordinary circumstances warranting the appointment, and where grandmother's petition disclosed that the child had resided with her for fourteen days, and where the district court granted the child's father's motion to dismiss grandmother's petition on the grounds that the child had not resided with grandmother for a period of ninety days prior to the filing of the petition as required by § 40-10B-8(B)(3) NMSA 1978, and that the petition failed to allege facts sufficient to establish \"extraordinary circumstances\" under the act as a matter of law, the district court erred in dismissing the petition because the legislature did not intend the ninety-day residence requirement to be strictly applied when there are extraordinary circumstances, and the extraordinary circumstances alleged by grandmother, that the child's mother had suddenly died and that the child had not had contact with her father for nearly a year based on his noncompliance with an order of a domestic relations court requiring him to improve his parenting skills, satisfied the purposes and spirit of Subsection 40-10B-8(B)(3).D.W. v. B.C., 2022-NMCA-006.\n\nExtraordinary circumstances were not proven.— Where, in a divorce action, although respondent and respondent's ex-spouse were both found to be fit, custody of respondent's children was awarded to the ex-spouse; the ex-spouse and children lived in New Mexico for eleven years; respondent lived in Texas where the children visited respondent during summers and holidays; when the ex-spouse developed cancer, the children stayed with petitioners for brief periods while the ex-spouse receive medical treatments; when the ex-spouse died, petitioners sought to be appointed as kinship guardians over the children; petitioners were friends of the ex-spouse, but had no biological relationship to the children; the children wanted to stay with petitioners because they had strong ties with the community, wanted to finish school in the community, and were eligible for college scholarships in New Mexico; and there was no evidence that the move to Texas with respondent would cause serious psychological harm or other serious detriment to the children, the evidence did not establish that there were extraordinary circumstances to rebut the presumption that the welfare and best interests of the children would best be served in the custody of respondent.Stanley J. v.
