Upon finding that domestic abuse has occurred or upon stipulation of the parties, the court shall enter an order of protection ordering the restrained party to:\n\n(1) refrain from abusing the protected party or any other household member; and\n\n(2) if the order is issued pursuant to this section and if the court also determines that the restrained party presents a credible threat to the physical safety of the household member after the restrained party has received notice and had an opportunity to be heard or by stipulation of the parties, to:\n\n(a) deliver any firearm in the restrained party's possession, care, custody or control to a law enforcement agency, law enforcement officer or federal firearms licensee while the order of protection is in effect; and\n\n(b) refrain from purchasing, receiving, or possessing or attempting to purchase, receive or possess any firearm while the order of protection is in effect.\n\nB. In an order of protection entered pursuant to Subsection A of this section, the court shall specifically describe the acts the court has ordered the restrained party to do or refrain from doing. As a part of any order of protection, the court may:\n\n(1) grant sole possession of the residence or household to the protected party during the period the order of protection is effective or order the restrained party to provide temporary suitable alternative housing for the protected party and any children to whom the restrained party owes a legal obligation of support;\n\n(2) award temporary custody of any children involved when appropriate and provide for visitation rights, child support and temporary support for the protected party on a basis that gives primary consideration to the safety of the protected party and the children;\n\n(3) order that the restrained party shall not initiate contact with the protected party;\n\n(4) restrain a party from transferring, concealing, encumbering or otherwise disposing of the other party's property or the joint property of the parties except in the usual course of business or for the necessities of life and require the parties to account to the court for all such transferences, encumbrances and expenditures made after the order is served or communicated to the restrained party;\n\n(5) order the restrained party to reimburse the protected party or any other household member for expenses reasonably related to the occurrence of domestic abuse, including medical expenses, counseling expenses, the expense of seeking temporary shelter, expenses for the replacement or repair of damaged property or the expense of lost wages;\n\n(6) order the restrained party to participate in, at the restrained party's expense, professional counseling programs deemed appropriate by the court, including counseling programs for perpetrators of domestic abuse, alcohol abuse or abuse of controlled substances; and\n\n(7) order other injunctive relief as the court deems necessary for the protection of a party, including orders to law enforcement agencies as provided by this section.\n\nC. The order of protection shall contain notice that violation of any provision of the order of protection is a violation of state law and that federal law, 18 U.S.C. 922, et seq., prohibits possession of firearms by certain persons.\n\nD. If the order of protection supersedes or alters prior orders of the court pertaining to domestic matters between the parties, the order shall say so on its face. If an action relating to child custody or child support is pending or has concluded with entry of an order at the time the petition for an order of protection was filed, the court may enter an initial order of protection, but the portion of the order dealing with child custody or child support will then be transferred to the court that has or continues to have jurisdiction over the pending or prior custody or support action.\n\nE. A mutual order of protection shall be issued only in cases where both parties have petitioned the court and the court makes detailed findings of fact indicating that both parties acted primarily as aggressors and that neither party acted primarily in self-defense.\n\nF. No order issued under the Family Violence Protection Act shall affect title to any property or allow a party to transfer, conceal, encumber or otherwise dispose of another party's property or the joint or community property of the parties.\n\nG. Either party may request a review hearing to amend an order of protection. An order of protection involving child custody or support may be modified without proof of a substantial or material change of circumstances.\n\nH. An order of protection shall not be issued unless a petition or a counter petition has been filed.\n\nHistory:Laws 1987, ch. 286, § 5; 1993, ch. 109, § 3; 2001, ch. 15, § 1; 2008, ch. 40, § 7; 2019, ch. 253, § 3.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective July 1, 2019, revised the required contents of an order of protection; in Subsection A, added Paragraph A(2); in Subsection B, in the introductory clause, added \"In an order of protection entered pursuant to Subsection A of this section\"; deleted former Subsection B; added a new Subsection C and redesignated former Subsections C through G as Subsections D through H, respectively.\n\nThe 2008 amendment,effective July 1, 2008, changed \"petitioner\" to \"protected party\" and \"respondent\" to \"restrained party\" and added Subsections D and G.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, inserted Paragraphs A(5) and (6), which add provisions for financial remedies and counseling programs for victims of domestic abuse, and renumbered the remaining paragraph accordingly.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, in Subsection A, in the first sentence of the introductory paragraph, deleted \"an act of\" preceding \"domestic abuse\" and deleted \"household member\" following \"respondent\", substituted \"the acts\" for \"in clear language understandable to the respondent the behavior\" in the second sentence of the introductory paragraph, made a minor stylistic change in Paragraph (2), and inserted \"require the parties\" in Paragraph (4); added the second sentence in Subsection C; and added the second sentence in Subsection E.\n\nPetitioners are not required to provide a showing of imminent danger in seeking an order of protection.— The district court erred in adopting the hearing officer's order dismissing petitioner's petition for order of protection and domestic abuse on the basis that petitioner failed to demonstrate that respondent posed an ongoing and present danger, because the plain language of NMSA 1978, § 40-13-5(A) requires the district court to enter an order of protection upon a finding that domestic abuse has occurred. There is no language that indicates a petition must state why a petitioner needs the order, or even language that requires proof of a petitioner's need for that order.Nguyen v. Bui, 2023-NMSC-020.\n\nChild custody.— As far as child custody matters are concerned, the Family Violence Protection Act is to be used only in emergency situations and as a temporary remedy that is limited in scope.Lucero v. Pino, 1997-NMCA-089, 124 N.M. 28, 946 P.2d 232, cert. denied, 123 N.M. 626, 944 P.2d 274.\n\nExpiration of custody order.— Issue of whether an order transferring child custody under the Family Violence Protection Act should have been declared void under Rule 1-060B (4) NMRA was moot since the order had expired.Lucero v. Pino, 1997-NMCA-089, 124 N.M. 28, 946 P.2d 232, cert. denied, 123 N.M. 626, 944 P.2d 274.\n\nRespondent's conduct constituted \"severe emotional distress\".— Where respondent appealed the district court's finding that respondent violated an order of protection that prohibited her from contacting petitioner and from committing further acts of abuse or threats of abuse against petitioner, evidence that respondent posted on the internet numerous photos of petitioner snorting prescription drugs, which were accompanied by statements claiming that petitioner was a \"junkie\", a \"drug-addled imbecile\" and a \"drug-addicted hypocrite\", and testimony from petitioner regarding the adverse effects, including nightmares and thoughts of suicide, that respondent's conduct had on petitioner's life, there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that respondent's online activity caused petitioner severe emotional distress.Best v. Marino, 2017-NMCA-073, cert. denied.\n\nOrder of protection did not violate respondent's due process rights.— Where respondent was found in criminal contempt for her violation of an order of protection, which expressly prohibited respondent from engaging in conduct that would cause petitioner to suffer severe emotional distress, and where respondent repeatedly posted on the internet photos of petitioner snorting prescription drugs, implying that petitioner had a substance abuse problem, accompanied by statements claiming that petitioner was a \"junkie\" a \"drug-addled imbecile\" and a \"drug-addicted hypocrite\", respondent's due process rights were not violated, because the order provided respondent with sufficient notice that her online activity would constitute a violation.Best v. Marino, 2017-NMCA-073, cert. denied.\n\nOrder of protection's restriction of respondent's ability to access the internet was unconstitutionally overbroad.— Where the district court issued an order of protection based on respondent's sustained pattern of stalking and harassment of petitioner, the court's restriction of respondent's ability to access the internet was a clear prior restraint on respondent's first amendment rights and was not the least restrictive means by which to address the harm in this case, and therefore the district court's restriction was unconstitutionally overbroad and violated respondent's first amendment rights.Best v. Marino, 2017-NMCA-073, cert. denied.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Where provision in order prohibiting domestic violence (OPDV) prohibiting \"battering in any manner\" contained all elements of the statutorily defined offense of battery, a criminal prosecution for battery following a contempt proceeding for violating the OPDV violated defendant's right against double jeopardy.State v. Powers, 1998-NMCA-133, 126 N.M. 114, 967 P.2d 454, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 392, 981 P.2d 1210.",

Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection C of Section 40-13-6 NMSA 1978, an order of protection granted pursuant to this section shall continue until the expiration provided in the order, if any, or until modified or rescinded upon a motion by the victim.\n\nHistory:Laws 2016, ch. 32, § 1 and Laws 2016, ch. 33, § 1.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2016 , ch. 32, § 2 and Laws 2016, ch. 33, § 2 made Laws 2016, ch. 32, § 1 and Laws 2016, ch. 33, § 1 effective July 1, 2016.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 2016, ch. 32, § 1 and Laws 2016, ch. 33, § 1, both effective July 1, 2016, enacted identical new sections.

An order of protection granted under the Family Violence Protection Act shall be filed with the clerk of the court, and a copy shall be sent by the clerk to the local law enforcement agency. The order shall be personally served upon the restrained party, unless the restrained party or the restrained party's attorney was present at the time the order was issued. The order shall be filed and served without cost to the protected party.\n\nB. A local law enforcement agency receiving an order of protection from the clerk of the court that was issued under the Family Violence Protection Act shall have the order entered in the national crime information center's order of protection file within seventy-two hours of receipt. This does not include temporary orders of protection entered pursuant to the provisions of Section 40-13-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. An order of protection granted by the court involving custody or support shall be effective for a fixed period of time not to exceed six months. The order may be extended for good cause upon motion of the protected party for an additional period of time not to exceed six months. Injunctive orders shall continue until modified or rescinded upon motion by either party or until the court approves a subsequent consent agreement entered into by the parties.\n\nD. A peace officer may arrest without a warrant and take into custody a restrained party whom the peace officer has probable cause to believe has violated an order of protection that is issued pursuant to the Family Violence Protection Act or entitled to full faith and credit.\n\nE. A restrained party convicted of violating an order of protection granted by a court under the Family Violence Protection Act is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be sentenced in accordance with Section 31-19-1 NMSA 1978. Upon a second or subsequent conviction, an offender shall be sentenced to a jail term of not less than seventy-two consecutive hours that shall not be suspended, deferred or taken under advisement.\n\nF. In addition to any other punishment provided in the Family Violence Protection Act, the court shall order a person convicted to make full restitution to the party injured by the violation of an order of protection and shall order the person convicted to participate in and complete a program of professional counseling, at the person's own expense, if possible.\n\nG. In addition to charging the person with violating an order of protection, a peace officer shall file all other possible criminal charges arising from an incident of domestic abuse when probable cause exists.\n\nH. The remedies provided in the Family Violence Protection Act are in addition to any other civil or criminal remedy available to the protected party or the state.\n\nHistory:Laws 1987, ch. 286, § 6; 1993, ch. 109, § 4; 1995, ch. 176, § 3; 1997, ch. 59, § 1; 1999, ch. 48, § 1; 2007, ch. 81, § 1; 2008, ch. 40, § 8; 2013, ch. 47, § 10.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective July 1, 2013, deleted provisions that provided for the enforcement of orders of protection issued by tribal courts and courts of other states; in Subsection D, after \"A peace officer\", deleted \"shall\" and added \"may\"; and deleted former Subsection E, which required state courts to give full faith and credit to protection orders issued by tribal courts and courts in other states, unless the protection order was not based on a pleading seeking a protection order or findings that each party was entitled to a protection order.\n\nThe 2008 amendment,effective July 1, 2008, changed \"petitioner\" to \"protected party\" and \"respondent\" to \"restrained party\".\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, adds a new Subsection B to require local law enforcement agencies to enter orders of protection in the national crime information center's order of protection file within 72 hours of receipt.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, in Subsection D added \"and orders of protection issued by the courts and other states\" at the end of the first sentence, added the second sentence, and added Paragraphs (1) and (2).\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective June 20, 1997, inserted \"filed and\" preceding \"served\" in the last sentence of Subsection A.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, deleted the first part of the last sentence of Subsection A which read, \"If the petitioner has been found by the court to be unable to pay court costs\", and substituted \"abuse\" for \"violence\" in Subsection G.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, in Subsection A, substituted \"local law enforcement agency\" for \"to the state police or to the municipal police of the city in which the court is located\" in the first sentence; in Subsection B, in the first sentence, inserted \"involving custody or support\" and substituted \"six\" for \"three\", substituted \"six\" for \"three\" in the second sentence, and added the third sentence; added Subsections D through G and redesignated former Subsection D as present Subsection H.\n\nKnowledge is an element of the crime of violating an order of protectionwhich requires the state to prove knowledge of the protective order and the presence of the protected person within the protected zone.State v. Ramos, 2013-NMSC-031.\n\nWhere defendant was tried for violating a protection order; the district court refused defendant's jury instruction that required the jury to find that defendant \"knowingly\" violated the protection order; and the district court granted defendant's alternative request to give the jury the general criminal intent instruction consistent with UJI 14-141 NMRA, the general criminal intent instruction was insufficient because knowledge and intent are separate, not synonymous, elements and the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury of a knowing violation.State v. Ramos, 2013-NMSC-031.\n\nDouble jeopardy.— Where defendant had been convicted of contempt, a misdemeanor, for violating a domestic violence protective order and sentenced to jail time, double jeopardy did not bar prosecution of defendant for the offenses of stalking and harassment stemming from the same conduct that gave rise to the contempt adjudication.State v. Gonzales, 1997-NMCA-039, 123 N.M. 337, 940 P.2d 185.\n\nBecause the crimes of kidnapping and attempted criminal sexual penetration contain elements not contained in the order prohibiting domestic violence (OPDV) obtained by victim against defendant, defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated by his conviction for those crimes following his conviction for contempt for violating the OPDV.State v. Powers, 1998-NMCA-133, 126 N.M. 114, 967 P.2d 454, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 392, 981 P.2d 1210.\n\nWhere the order of protection clearly and unambiguously ordered defendant not to \"contact\" victim, each and every time defendant called victim on two separate dates in the same year, he made a \"contact\" with victim in violation of the order of protection. Because the legislature has made its intent clear that each violation will be punished separately, defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy in sentencing was not violated.State v. McGee, 2004-NMCA-014, 135 N.M. 73, 84 P.3d 690, cert denied, 2004-NMCERT-001 135 N.M. 160, 85 P.3d 802.\n\nIntent of act.— The Family Violence Protection Act clearly reflects its intent that each violation shall be subject to a separate prosecution and punishment.State v. McGee, 2004-NMCA-014, 135 N.M. 73, 84 P.3d 690, cert denied, 2004-NMCERT-001 135 N.M. 160, 85 P.3d 802.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The New Mexico Law Review Presents a Symposium on Enforcing the Judgments of Tribal Courts: A Different Kind of Symmetry,\" see 34 N.M.L.

A local law enforcement officer responding to the request for assistance shall be required to take whatever steps are reasonably necessary to protect the victim from further domestic abuse, including:\n\n(1) advising the victim of the remedies available under the Family Violence Protection Act; the right to file a written statement, a criminal complaint and a request for an arrest warrant; and the availability of domestic violence shelters, medical care, counseling and other services;\n\n(2) upon the request of the victim, providing or arranging for transportation of the victim to a medical facility or place of shelter;\n\n(3) upon the request of the victim, accompanying the victim to the victim's residence to obtain the victim's clothing and personal effects required for immediate needs and the clothing and personal effects of any children then in the care of the victim;\n\n(4) upon the request of the victim, assist in placing the victim in possession of the dwelling or premises or otherwise assist in execution, enforcement or service of an order of protection;\n\n(5) arresting the alleged perpetrator when appropriate and including a written statement in the attendant police report to indicate that the arrest of the alleged perpetrator was, in whole or in part, premised upon probable cause to believe that the alleged perpetrator committed domestic abuse against the victim and, when appropriate, indicate that the party arrested was the predominant aggressor; and\n\n(6) advising the victim when appropriate of the procedure for initiating proceedings under the Family Violence Protection Act or criminal proceedings and of the importance of preserving evidence.\n\nC. The jail or detention center shall make a reasonable attempt to notify the arresting law enforcement agency or officer when the alleged perpetrator is released from custody. The arresting law enforcement agency shall make a reasonable attempt to notify the victim that the alleged perpetrator is released from custody.\n\nD. Any law enforcement officer responding to a request for assistance under the Family Violence Protection Act is immune from civil liability to the extent allowed by law. Any jail, detention center or law enforcement agency that makes a reasonable attempt to provide notification that an alleged perpetrator is released from custody is immune from civil liability to the extent allowed by law.\n\nE. A statement shall be included in a judgment and sentence document to indicate when a conviction results from the commission of domestic abuse.\n\nHistory:Laws 1987, ch. 286, § 7; 1995, ch. 54, § 1; 2008, ch. 40, § 9.\n\nThe 2008 amendment,effective July 1, 2008, changed \"petitioner\" to \"victim\" and \"abusing household member\" to \"alleged perpetrator\"; in Paragraph (1) of Subsection B, authorized a law enforcement officer to file a criminal complaint; and in Paragraph (5) of Subsection B, authorized a law enforcement officer to indicate that the party arrested was the predominant aggressor.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, added \"providing notification to victims when an abusing household member is released from detention; statement in judgment and sentence document\" in the section heading, added the language beginning \"and including a written statement\" at the end in Paragraph (5) of Subsection B, added Subsections C and E, redesignated former Subsection C as Subsection D, and added the second sentence in Subsection D.\n\nProvisions of Article not to be pretext for search.— An arrest under the Family Violence Protection Act was not authorized where the victim of abuse was no longer in danger and the arrest of the alleged abuser was a mere pretext to search for drugs.State v. Miller, 1997-NMCA-060, 123 N.M. 507, 943 P.2d 541.\n\nFamily Violence Protection Act does not circumvent warrant requirement.— Where officers responded to a domestic violence call made by defendant's girlfriend, who had been staying at defendant's apartment for a few days, the officers' entry into the apartment and subsequent discovery and seizure of drug paraphernalia was not valid under the community caretaker doctrine or any other exception to the warrant requirement, because defendant had already left the apartment and the officers did not have credible and specific information that a victim was likely to be located at a particular place and in need of immediate aid to avoid great bodily harm or death, and although the Family Violence Protection Act contemplates law enforcement assistance to protect a victim of domestic violence from further abuse when retrieving items from inside the victim's residence, it does not circumvent the requirement that only a genuine emergency will justify entering and searching a residence without a warrant and without consent, and in this case there was no indication of an emergency inside the apartment justifying a warrantless entry.State v. Ramos, 2017-NMCA-041.\n\nArrest without a warrant.— A law enforcement officer may arrest, without a warrant, an offender who commits a misdemeanor domestic violence offense and leaves the scene prior to the officer's arrival, provided that the arrest is reasonably prompt and reasonably necessary to protect the victim. 2005 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 05-05.",

A law enforcement officer or law enforcement agency shall take possession of all firearms subject to the order of protection that are relinquished by the restrained party or are in plain sight or are discovered pursuant to a lawful search.\n\nC. A law enforcement officer or law enforcement agency that takes temporary possession of a firearm pursuant to this section shall:\n\n(1) prepare a receipt identifying all firearms that have been relinquished or taken;\n\n(2) provide a copy of the receipt to the restrained party;\n\n(3) provide a copy of the receipt to the petitioner within seventy-two hours of taking possession of the firearm;\n\n(4) file the original receipt with the court that issued the order of protection within seventy-two hours of taking possession of the firearm; and\n\n(5) ensure that the law enforcement agency retains a copy of the receipt.\n\nD.
