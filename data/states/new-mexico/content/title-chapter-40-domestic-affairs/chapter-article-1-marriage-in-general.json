      "heading": "[Marriage is civil contract requiring consent of parties",
      "text": "Marriage is contemplated by the law as a civil contract, for which the consent of the contracting parties, capable in law of contracting, is essential.\n\nHistory:Laws 1862-1863, p. 64; C.L. 1865, ch. 75, § 2; C.L. 1884, § 978; C.L. 1897, § 1415; Code 1915, § 3425; C.S. 1929, § 87-101; 1941 Comp., § 65-101; 1953 Comp., § 57-1-1.\n\nCross references.— For marriage settlement and separation contracts,see40-2-4 to 40-2-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor dissolution of marriage,see40-4-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor jurisdiction of children's court to authorize marriage of minor,see32A-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor magistrates solemnizing contract of marriage,see35-3-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nPurpose of marriage laws.— The purpose of New Mexico marriage laws is to bring stability and order to the legal relationship of committed couples by defining their rights and responsibilities as to one another, their children if they choose to raise children together, and their property.Griego v. Oliver, 2014-NMSC-003.\n\nSame-gender marriages.— Barring individuals from marrying and depriving them of the rights, protections and responsibilities of civil marriage solely because of their sexual orientation violates the equal protection clause of Article II, Section 18 of the New Mexico constitution. The state of New Mexico is constitutionally required to allow same-gender couples to marry and must extend to them the rights, protections and responsibilities that derive from civil marriage under New Mexico law.Griego v. Oliver, 2014-NMSC-003.\n\nMeaning of the phrase \"civil marriage\" in New Mexico marriage laws.— The phrase \"civil marriage\" in New Mexico marriage laws shall be construed to mean the voluntary union of two persons to the exclusion of all others. All rights, protections and responsibilities that result from the marital relationship shall apply equally to both same-gender and opposite-gender married couples. When reference is made to marriage, husband, wife, spouse, family, immediate family, dependent, next of kin, widow, widower, or any other word, which in context denotes a marital relationship, the same shall apply to same-gender couples who choose to marry.Griego v. Oliver, 2014-NMSC-003.\n\nEffect of section is to deny validity to mere consent marriage.In re Gabaldon's Estate, 1934-NMSC-053, 38 N.M. 392, 34 P.2d 672, 94 A.L.R. 980.\n\nMarriage, standing alone, is presumed valid.— That is, the party attacking it carries the burden of proof and the invalidity must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Panzer v. Panzer, 1974-NMSC-092, 87 N.M. 29, 528 P.2d 888.\n\nLack of evidence of license does not rebut presumption.— Mere lack of evidence of a record of the issuance of a license or of a ceremonial marriage is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of a ceremonial marriage.Trower v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1965-NMSC-040, 75 N.M. 125, 401 P.2d 109,overruled on other groundsPanzer v. Panzer, 1974-NMSC-092, 87 N.M. 29, 528 P.2d 888.\n\nPresumption attaches to marriage that is later in time.Panzer v. Panzer, 1974-NMSC-092, 87 N.M. 29, 528 P.2d 888.\n\nEvidence to prove valid marriage.— While this article prescribes the manner in which a marriage may be solemnized in this state, nowhere does it set forth rules of evidence by which a valid marriage must be proven. The fact of marriage may be proven either by direct or circumstantial evidence, documentary evidence or by parol, and the sufficiency of the evidence to establish a marriage is governed by the general rules of evidence.Trower v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1965-NMSC-040, 75 N.M. 125, 401 P.2d 109,overruled on other groundsPanzer v. Panzer, 1974-NMSC-092, 87 N.M. 29, 528 P.2d 888.\n\nCommon-law marriages historically invalid.— Until the enactment of this section, the law relating to marriages in New Mexico stood as if the rule of the council of Trent of 1563 was the law of the land, except as modified by the section compiled as 40-1-2 NMSA 1978. Under said rule, valid marriages must have been celebrated before the parish or other priest, or by license of the ordinary, and before two or three witnesses, and consent marriages were invalid. Section40-1-2 NMSA 1978 added only the provision that any clergyman or a civil magistrate could perform marriages, and the law of which the present section was a part added the first regulatory provisions without changing the basic foundation of lawful marriages. Since the civil law rule was modified by statute prior to the adoption of the common law as the rule of practice and decision here, the latter had no effect, and common-law marriages have never been valid in New Mexico.In re Gabaldon's Estate, 1934-NMSC-053, 38 N.M. 392, 34 P.2d 672, 94 A.L.R. 980.\n\nMarriage is a contract.— In New Mexico, marriage is a civil contract which must be licensed and a contract in which the public is interested and to which the state is a party.In re Bivians Estate, 1982-NMCA-132, 98 N.M. 722, 652 P.2d 744, cert. quashed, 98 N.M. 762, 652 P.2d 1213.\n\nMarriage not recognized unless formally contracted and solemnized.— New Mexico does not recognize any marriage consummated therein which is not formally consummated by contract and solemnized before an official.Hazelwood v. Hazelwood, 1976-NMSC-074, 89 N.M. 659, 556 P.2d 345;Merrill v. Davis, 1983-NMSC-070, 100 N.M. 552, 673 P.2d 1285.\n\nDe facto marriage not ground for retroactive modification of alimony.— A \"de facto marriage,\" whatever may be required to constitute such, does not constitute grounds for retroactively modifying or abating accrued alimony payments; although, the district court does have discretion to modify prospectively or terminate an alimony award, if the circumstances so warrant, where the termination of alimony was largely predicated on its finding of a de facto marriage, the judgment of the trial court was reversed and the cause remanded.Hazelwood v. Hazelwood, 1976-NMSC-074, 89 N.M. 659, 556 P.2d 345.\n\nCivil claims between unmarried cohabitants disputing ownership of a business.— Where plaintiff and defendant lived together as an unmarried couple from 2005 to 2015, and where plaintiff claimed that the parties agreed to start a business together and agreed to share ownership of that business, and where, after the parties separated in 2015, plaintiff filed suit against defendant for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, common law fraud, constructive fraud, conversion, negligent representation, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and prima facie tort, and where defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion on the breach of contract claim, because pursuant to New Mexico precedent, plaintiff had the burden to provide evidence resulting in reasonable inferences that the parties entered into an express agreement to jointly own property, and it was undisputed that there was never any written contract and there was no evidence of a verbal contract between the parties. An inference based on the parties' conduct that a contract existed is an implied contract, which is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact regarding whether two cohabitating parties entered an agreement to jointly own property.Battishill v. Ingram, 2024-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nSummary judgment improper where unmarried cohabitant was unjustly enriched.— Where plaintiff and defendant lived together as an unmarried couple from 2005 to 2015, and where plaintiff claimed that the parties agreed to start a business together and agreed to share ownership of that business, and where, after the parties separated in 2015, plaintiff filed suit against defendant for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, common law fraud, constructive fraud, conversion, negligent representation, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and prima facie tort, and where defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, the district court erred in granting defendant's motion on the unjust enrichment claim, because to establish unjust enrichment, plaintiff was required to demonstrate a genuine issue of fact regarding whether defendant knowingly benefitted at plaintiff's expense in such a manner that allowing defendant to retain the benefit would be unjust, and in this case, plaintiff presented evidence that she worked at the business without compensation for at least two years, which is sufficient evidence to allow reasonable minds to differ on whether defendant received unjust benefits from plaintiff's professional services.Battishill v. Ingram, 2024-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nPromissory estoppel not warranted for unmarried cohabitant providing homemaking services.— Where plaintiff and defendant lived together as an unmarried couple from 2005 to 2015, and where plaintiff claimed that the parties agreed to start a business together and agreed to share ownership of that business, and where, after the parties separated in 2015, plaintiff filed suit against defendant for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, common law fraud, constructive fraud, conversion, negligent representation, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and prima facie tort, and where plaintiff relied on the homemaking services she provided as evidence of a reasonable inference that defendant made a promise to share ownership of the business, the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment on the promissory estoppel claim, because homemaking services provided in the context of the romantic relationship do not lead to a reasonable inference that defendant promised half ownership of the business, and there was no evidence that defendant made an actual promise which in fact induced action or forbearance on the part of plaintiff.Battishill v. Ingram, 2024-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nUnmarried cohabitant failed to demonstrate negligent misrepresentation.— Where plaintiff and defendant lived together as an unmarried couple from 2005 to 2015, and where plaintiff claimed that the parties agreed to start a business together and agreed to share ownership of that business, and where, after the parties separated in 2015, plaintiff filed suit against defendant for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, common law fraud, constructive fraud, conversion, negligent representation, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and prima facie tort, the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment on the negligent misrepresentation claim, because for plaintiff's negligent misrepresentation claim to survive a motion for summary judgment, plaintiff was required to raise issues of fact that defendant made a material misrepresentation to plaintiff, that plaintiff relied upon the representation, that defendant knew the representation was false or made it recklessly, and that defendant intended to induce reliance by plaintiff, and in this case, plaintiff failed to provide any evidence that defendant made an express representation to plaintiff that the parties jointly own the business, and therefore plaintiff failed to provide evidence that would lead to a reasonable inference that defendant knew any misrepresentation made was false or made recklessly, or that defendant intended to induce reliance by plaintiff.Battishill v. Ingram, 2024-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nUnmarried cohabitant failed to demonstrate common law fraud.— Where plaintiff and defendant lived together as an unmarried couple from 2005 to 2015, and where plaintiff claimed that the parties agreed to start a business together and agreed to share ownership of that business, and where, after the parties separated in 2015, plaintiff filed suit against defendant for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, common law fraud, constructive fraud, conversion, negligent representation, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and prima facie tort, the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment on the common law fraud claim, because for plaintiff's common law fraud claim to survive a motion for summary judgment, plaintiff was required to raise issues of fact that defendant misrepresented a fact that he knew to be false, it was made with the intent to deceive and to induce plaintiff to act in reliance, and that plaintiff actually relied on the representation to her detriment, and in this case, plaintiff failed to provide any evidence that defendant made a representation that he knew to be false with the intent to deceive and to induce plaintiff to act in reliance.Battishill v. Ingram, 2024-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nUnmarried cohabitant failed to provide evidence of constructive fraud.— Where plaintiff and defendant lived together as an unmarried couple from 2005 to 2015, and where plaintiff claimed that the parties agreed to start a business together and agreed to share ownership of that business, and where, after the parties separated in 2015, plaintiff filed suit against defendant for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, common law fraud, constructive fraud, conversion, negligent representation, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and prima facie tort, the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment on the constructive fraud claim, because an action for constructive fraud is maintainable where there is a nondisclosure of material facts and the person charged with the constructive fraud had a duty to speak under the circumstances, and in this case, plaintiff failed to provide any evidence of an express agreement to share ownership of the business and therefore there was no evidence that defendant owed plaintiff a duty to speak under the circumstances, and, because the parties were not married, there was no fiduciary relationship between the parties.Battishill v. Ingram, 2024-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nUnmarried cohabitant failed to provide evidence of conversion by demand and refusal.— Where plaintiff and defendant lived together as an unmarried couple from 2005 to 2015, and where plaintiff claimed that the parties agreed to start a business together and agreed to share ownership of that business, and where, after the parties separated in 2015, plaintiff filed suit against defendant for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, common law fraud, constructive fraud, conversion, negligent representation, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and prima facie tort, and where defendant claimed that there were material facts that demonstrate she had ownership and right to possession of one-half interest in the business because she formed a partnership with defendant and thus defendant is liable of conversion by demand and refusal because he engaged in deceptive practices in order to have the corporation established without granting 50 percent of the stock in the corporation to plaintiff, the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment on the conversion claim, because plaintiff failed to establish a question of fact regarding her right of possession of personal property because a business partnership between unmarried cohabitants requires an express contract.Battishill v. Ingram, 2024-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nUnmarried cohabitant failed to provide evidence of prima facie tort.— Where plaintiff and defendant lived together as an unmarried couple from 2005 to 2015, and where plaintiff claimed that the parties agreed to start a business together and agreed to share ownership of that business, and where, after the parties separated in 2015, plaintiff filed suit against defendant for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, common law fraud, constructive fraud, conversion, negligent representation, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and prima facie tort, and where plaintiff claimed that by failing to convey half the interest of the business to plaintiff, there was a reasonable inference that defendant intended to injure plaintiff, the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment on the prima facie tort claim, because plaintiff failed to raise a material issue of fact as to the absence of justification for the alleged injurious act and failed to provide any evidence that leads to a reasonable inference that the parties entered into an express agreement to jointly own the business. Accordingly, defendant was justified in not conveying any business interest to plaintiff.Battishill v. Ingram, 2024-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nUnmarried cohabitant failed to provide evidence of covenant of good faith and fair dealing.— Where plaintiff and defendant lived together as an unmarried couple from 2005 to 2015, and where plaintiff claimed that the parties agreed to start a business together and agreed to share ownership of that business, and where, after the parties separated in 2015, plaintiff filed suit against defendant for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, common law fraud, constructive fraud, conversion, negligent representation, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and prima facie tort, the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim, because the parties' cohabitating romantic relationship required them to enter into an express agreement to jointly own property, and plaintiff failed to provide evidence of an express agreement. Therefore, there is no agreement and no implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Battishill v. Ingram, 2024-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nSpecial power of attorney for application and marriage by proxy.— The execution of a special power of attorney, for the purpose of participating in the application for a marriage license and subsequently in a marriage ceremony by proxy, should be before a person authorized to administer oaths, including military officers on active duty and should specify completely the required information as to age, relationship of the engaged persons, consanguinity, present marital status, and a specific statement authorizing the named attorney in fact or proxy to enter into a contract with the person named. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-13.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Annulment of Marriages in New Mexico: Part II - Proposed Statute,\" see 2 Nat.

      "heading": "Marriages solemnized; ordained clergy or civil magistrates may solemnize.",
      "text": "A. The civil contract of marriage is entered into when solemnized as provided in Chapter 40, Article 1 NMSA 1978. As used in Chapter 40, Article 1 NMSA 1978, \"solemnize\" means to join in marriage before witnesses by means of a ceremony.\n\nB. A person who is an ordained member of the clergy or who is an authorized representative of a federally recognized Indian nation, tribe or pueblo may solemnize the contract of marriage without regard to sect or rites and customs the person may practice.\n\nC. Active or retired judges, justices and magistrates of any of the courts established by the constitution of New Mexico, United States constitution, laws of the state or laws of the United States are civil magistrates having authority to solemnize contracts of marriage. Civil magistrates solemnizing contracts of marriage shall charge no fee therefor.\n\nHistory:Laws 1859-1860, p. 120; C.L. 1865, ch. 75, § 1; C.L. 1884, § 977; C.L. 1897, § 1414; Code 1915, § 3426; C.S. 1929, § 87-102; 1941 Comp., § 65-102; 1953 Comp., § 57-1-2; Laws 1983, ch. 193, § 1; 1989, ch. 78, § 1; 2001, ch. 99, § 1; 2013, ch. 144, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For magistrates solemnizing contract of marriage,see35-3-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective June 14, 2013, defined \"solemnized\"; in the, deleted \"clergyman\", and added \"marriages solemnized; ordained clergy\" and after \"solemnize\", deleted \"fees\"; added Subsection A; in Subsection B, after \"A person\", deleted \"may solemnize the contract of matrimony by means of\" and added \"who is\", after \"who is an ordained\", deleted \"clergyman\" and added \"member of the clergy\", after \"the clergy or\", added \"who is an\", after \"recognized Indian\", deleted \"tribe\" and added \"nation, tribe pueblo may solemnize the contract of marriage\", and after \"without regard to sect\", deleted \"to which he may belong\"; and in Subsection C, in the first sentence, added \"Active or retired judges\".\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, substituted \"A person may solemnize\" for \"It is lawful, valid and binding to all intents and purposes for those who may so desire to solemnize\" in Subsection A; and inserted \"United States constitution\" and \"or laws or the United States\" in Subsection B.\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective June 16, 1989, in Subsection A, inserted \"or authorized representative of a federally recognized Indian tribe\" and added \"or the rites and customs he may practice\", and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nProof and presumption of marriage ceremony.— A marriage ceremony may be proved by any competent witness present at the ceremony, and when proven, the contract, the capacity of the parties, and the validity of the marriage will be presumed.United States v. de Amador, 1891-NMSC-025, 6 N.M. 173, 27 P. 488;United States v. de Lujan, 1891-NMSC-026, 6 N.M. 179, 27 P. 489;United States v. Chaves, 1891-NMSC-027, 6 N.M. 180, 27 P. 489.\n\nStatute preceded common-law rule.— This section and historical fact indicate that, in the belief of those who framed and passed it, either because of the requirement of the council of Trent in 1563, or otherwise, the only valid marriage theretofore was one celebrated by a Roman Catholic priest, and so a mere consent marriage was and is invalid, since common-law marriages were never legalized in New Mexico, and the first regulating statute, of which 40-1-1 NMSA 1978 was a part, preceded the adoption of the common law as the rule of practice and decision.In re Gabaldon's Estate, 1934-NMSC-053, 38 N.M. 392, 34 P.2d 672, 94 A.L.R. 980.\n\nMarriage not recognized unless formally contracted and solemnized.— New Mexico does not recognize any marriage consummated therein which is not formally consummated by contract and solemnized before an official.Hazelwood v. Hazelwood, 1976-NMSC-074, 89 N.M. 659, 556 P.2d 345;Merrill v. Davis, 1983-NMSC-070, 100 N.M. 552, 673 P.2d 1285.\n\nCivil magistrates within section.— Probate judges, justices of the peace (now magistrates), and judges of the district court are civil magistrates within this section, although not specifically mentioned. Golden v. Golden, 1937-NMSC-021, 41 N.M. 356, 68 P.2d 928.\n\nCounty clerk not included.— Since county clerk is not a civil magistrate he cannot perform a marriage ceremony. 1941 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 41-3746.\n\nArmy or navy chaplain may perform marriage.— A duly ordained clergyman serving as an army or navy chaplain may perform marriage ceremony in this state. 1942 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 42-4028.\n\nPolice judge may perform marriage.— A police judge may legally perform a marriage ceremony in this state since he is a \"civil magistrate.\" 1942 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 42-4133.\n\nArea where judge may perform marriage ceremony.— A municipal judge cannot perform a marriage ceremony outside of the municipality in which he sits. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-36 (rendered under prior law).\n\nA magistrate judge cannot perform a marriage ceremony outside of his district. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-36 (rendered under prior law).\n\nTerritorial jurisdiction of judge.— Except for probate and municipal judges, judges and justices may solemnize marriages anywhere in New Mexico. 1991 Op.

Wilkerson, 1968-NMSC-156, 79 N.M. 549, 445 P.2d 970.\n\nDe facto spouse under Australian law was not a marriage.— Where an Australian court determined that petitioner was the de facto spouse of the decedent under the Australian property relationships law based on the facts that petitioner and decedent had a twenty-year relationship, lived together openly and publicly, and were involved in each other's business and economic affairs; the Australian property relationships law conferred the same succession rights on de facto spouses as it conferred on spouses in marriage; the Australian court expressly stated that the Australian property relationships law did not create a marriage; petitioner and the decedent were not married to each other; and the de facto spouse status conferred by the Australian property relations law was distinct from the status of marriage under both the Australian marriage law and the Australian family law; and the de facto relationship was not a common-law marriage, the de facto spouse relationship under the Australian property relationships law was not a marital relationship under New Mexico law.Dion v. Rieser, 2012-NMCA-071, 283 P.3d 871, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-006.\n\nComity.— Although this state does not authorize common-law marriages, it will recognize such marriages if valid in the jurisdiction where consummated. New Mexico applies the rule of comity, that the law of the place of contract governs the validity of a marriage.In re Estate of Bivians, 1982-NMCA-132, 98 N.M. 722, 652 P.2d 744, cert. quashed, 98 N.M. 762, 652 P.2d 1213.\n\nWhat constitutes common-law marriage.— Common-law marriage is considered to be a status arrived at by express or implied mutual consent or agreement of the parties, followed by cohabitation as husband and wife and publicly holding themselves out as such.Gallegos v. Wilkerson, 1968-NMSC-156, 79 N.M. 549, 445 P.2d 970.\n\nValidity of common-law marriage formed in foreign jurisdiction governed by its law.— To determine whether a valid common-law marriage was formed in a foreign jurisdiction, it is necessary to look to the substantive law of that jurisdiction. The threshold question is whether a couple established significant contacts with a jurisdiction recognizing common-law marriage.In re Estate of Lamb, 1982-NMSC-130, 99 N.M. 157, 655 P.2d 1001.\n\nNew Mexico law applies as to evidence required for validity.— Although foreign law determines the requisites of an asserted foreign common-law marriage, New Mexico law determines the competency, admissibility, quality, degree and quantum of evidence required to establish the vital facts.In re Estate of Bivians, 1982-NMCA-132, 98 N.M. 722, 652 P.2d 744, cert. quashed, 98 N.M. 762, 652 P.2d 1213.\n\nTransmuting illicit relationship into valid common-law marriage.— For an illicit relationship to become transmuted into a valid common-law marriage, the evidence must show actual matrimony by mutual consent of each of the parties within the state authorizing common-law marriage, plus each of the other elements required in that jurisdiction.In re Estate of Bivians, 1982-NMCA-132, 98 N.M. 722, 652 P.2d 744, cert. quashed, 98 N.M. 762, 652 P.2d 1213.\n\nProof required where original relationship in this state illicit.— If the original relationship of a couple in New Mexico is illicit and the couple continue to maintain legal residence in New Mexico, a common-law marriage cannot be inferred absent proof of each element necessary to establish a common-law marriage and a showing of substantial contacts by the parties with the state where the alleged common-law marriage occurred.In re Estate of Bivians, 1982-NMCA-132, 98 N.M. 722, 652 P.2d 744, cert. quashed, 98 N.M. 762, 652 P.2d 1213.\n\nEvidence of common-law marriage in Texas.— Where proof is present that parties went to El Paso, rented an apartment, agreed to a marriage between themselves, lived together there, and held themselves out as husband and wife, the finding of the court of a valid common-law marriage in Texas is thus supported by substantial evidence and should not be disturbed by supreme court.Gallegos v. Wilkerson, 1968-NMSC-156, 79 N.M. 549, 445 P.2d 970.\n\nCommon-law marriage of New Mexico residents.— This section makes lawful \"all marriages celebrated beyond the limits of this state, which are valid according to the laws\" of the place where celebrated. No exception is made for residents of New Mexico. That the court should not hold invalid a common-law marriage contracted by the parties in Texas, even though residents of New Mexico, would seem to be the direction of the section.Gallegos v. Wilkerson, 1968-NMSC-156, 79 N.M. 549, 445 P.2d 970.\n\nUncle/niece marriages.— This state recognizes the general rule, which is that a marriage valid when and where performed is valid everywhere, and has no judicial decision invalidating an uncle-niece marriage validly contracted outside the state.Leszinske v. Poole, 1990-NMCA-088, 110 N.M. 663, 798 P.2d 1049, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 533, 797 P.2d 983.\n\nSame-sex marriages.— A same-sex marriage that is valid under the laws of the country or state where it was consummated would be found valid in New Mexico. 2011 Op.

Laws 1884, this section contained the words \"and first cousins\" following the word \"nephews.\" Those words were deleted to accord with Laws 1880, ch. 37, § 1, which repealed \"such parts of all laws as prohibit the marriage of cousins of any degree.\"\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective June 14, 2013, defined incestuous marriages, added the title of the section; at the beginning of the section, deleted \"Sec. 6\"; after \"children, including\", deleted \"grandfathers\" and added \"grandparents\"; after \"all degrees; between\", deleted \"half\"; after \"brothers and sisters\", deleted \"as also\"; after \"of full blood\", added \"or of half blood\"; after \"uncles and nieces\" added \"and between\"; and deleted the former second sentence, which extended the section to illegitimate children to legitimize them.\n\nMarriage valid where celebrated.— New Mexico's public policy against incest did not preclude the district court from awarding a mother primary physical custody of her children, after taking into account her plans to marry her uncle, where that choice was in the best interests of the children, and mother and uncle intended to reside in California.Leszinske v.

In the case of minors, no party to the marriage who may be over the prohibited age shall be allowed to apply for or obtain a decree of the court declaring the marriage void; but the minor may do so, and the court may, in its discretion, grant alimony until the minor becomes of age or remarries.

The county clerk:\n\n(1) shall collect the social security number of an applicant for a marriage license only as provided for in Section 27-1-10 NMSA 1978;\n\n(2) shall not make available a social security number to another person except as provided for in Section 27-1-10 NMSA 1978; and\n\n(3) may, thirty days after the commencement of each fiscal year, dispose of, in a secure manner, those social security numbers collected in the previous fiscal year that have not been requested as provided for in Section 27-1-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:Laws 1905, ch. 65, § 1; Code 1915, § 3435; C.S. 1929, § 87-111; Laws 1939, ch. 25, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 65-110; 1953 Comp., § 57-1-10; Laws 1969, ch. 104, § 1; 1973, ch. 51, § 3; 2013, ch. 144, § 7.\n\nCross references.— For validation of marriages in 1905 where no license obtained,see40-1-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor removal of local officers,see10-4-1 to 10-4-29 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor age of majority, 18 years,see28-6-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective June 14, 2013, required that applicants for a marriage license personally appear before the county clerk; required the county clerk to obtain the social security numbers of applicants; in Subsection A, after \"couple desiring to marry\" deleted \"in\" and added \"pursuant to the laws of\", after \"New Mexico shall\", added \"first\", after \"county clerk\", added \"of this state\", after \"of this state and\", added \"following a ceremony conducted in this state\", after \"conducted in this state, file the\", deleted \"some\" and added \"license\" and deleted \"following the marriage ceremony\", and deleted the former second sentence, which prohibited the county clerk from issuing a marriage license to persons under the age of majority and required the county clerk to obtain the affidavits of two persons as to the age of the applicants when there was a doubt as to their age; and added Subsections B and C.\n\nCeremonial marriage without a license is not void.— The New Mexico marriage licensure statute is merely directory. Ceremonial marriages performed without a New Mexico license are valid.Rivera v. Rivera, 2010-NMCA-106, 149 N.M. 66, 243 P.3d 1148, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-010, 149 N.M. 64, 243 P.3d 1146.\n\nMarriages performed pursuant to license issued by another state.— Where the parties obtained a marriage license in Texas; the marriage license authorized any person who was authorized by the laws of Texas to perform marriage ceremonies in Texas to marry the parties; the parties were married by an ordained minister in New Mexico who was authorized to perform marriage ceremonies in New Mexico and in Texas; and the parties completed the marriage license by showing that the marriage had occurred in New Mexico and recorded the marriage license with the county clerk's office in Texas that had issued the marriage license, the marriage of the parties was valid.Rivera v. Rivera, 2010-NMCA-106, 149 N.M. 66, 243 P.3d 1148, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-010, 149 N.M. 64, 243 P.3d 1146.\n\nLack of evidence of license does not rebut presumption of marriage.— Mere lack of evidence of a record of the issuance of a license or of a ceremonial marriage is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of a ceremonial marriage.Trower v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1965-NMSC-040, 75 N.M. 125, 401 P.2d 109,overruled on other grounds byPanzer v.

It is also a contract in which the public is interested and to which the state is a party.In re Estate of Bivians, 1982-NMCA-132, 98 N.M. 722, 652 P.2d 744, cert. quashed, 98 N.M. 762, 652 P.2d 1213.\n\nOnly one parent's consent necessary.— When parental consent to the marriage of a minor is required, the consent of only one parent is necessary. 1964 Op.

Att'y Gen. No. 67-88.\n\nOath as to age before notary of another state.— The only reason that the parties appear before the county clerk or the deputy clerk is to allow the clerk's office to determine if the parties are of legal age to be married in this state without parental consent. The parties can take an oath as to their age before a notary of any other state. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-88.\n\nThere is no time limitationon validity of marriage licenses. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-53.\n\nMarriage valid even though performed in county other than where license obtained.— A marriage is valid even though the marriage ceremony was performed in a county of this state other than the county wherein the marriage license was obtained by the parties. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-104.\n\nPersons performing ceremonies not liable.— The act of a duly qualified justice of the peace (now magistrate), priest or minister, in performing a marriage ceremony where the marriage license was obtained in a county of this state other than that where the marriage ceremony was celebrated, does not fall within the mandatory or prohibited provisions, and the wording of this section does not expressly or by inference refer to persons performing the marriage ceremony. Therefore, such persons may perform such ceremonies without violating the marriage laws or subjecting themselves to criminal penalty. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-104.\n\nAm.
