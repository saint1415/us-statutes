      "text": "On the petition of either party to a marriage, a district court may decree a dissolution of marriage on any of the following grounds:\n\nA. incompatibility;\n\nB. cruel and inhuman treatment;\n\nC. adultery; or\n\nD. abandonment.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 22-7-1, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 319, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For annulment,see40-1-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor provisions of the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act,see40-10A-101 to 40-10A-403 NMSA 1978.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nForum non conveniens.— Where jurisdiction, residence, and incompatibility are shown to exist, a New Mexico trial court has no discretionary right to deny a divorce. The plaintiff's choice of forum should not be disturbed except for weighty reasons.Spruyt v. Spruyt, 1993-NMSC-020, 115 N.M. 405, 851 P.2d 1072.\n\nCourt not to deny divorce where ground shown.— The legislature has power to prescribe the causes affording grounds for divorce, and where a statutory ground is shown to exist, the court has no discretionary right to deny a divorce.State ex rel. DuBois v. Ryan, 1973-NMSC-097, 85 N.M. 575, 514 P.2d 851;Buckner v. Buckner, 1981-NMSC-007, 95 N.M. 337, 622 P.2d 242.\n\nII. INCOMPATIBILITY.\n\nCourt must decree divorce upon finding of incompatibility.— The legislature, acting properly within its powers, has established \"incompatibility\" as a ground for divorce and once such a finding is made that it exists, a divorce decree must be entered.Garner v. Garner, 1973-NMSC-067, 85 N.M. 324, 512 P.2d 84.\n\nCourt not vacating incompatibility finding cannot vacate divorce award.— The trial court, having found husband and wife to be incompatible, having awarded a divorce on that ground, and not having vacated that finding, lacked discretion and power to vacate the award.State ex rel. DuBois v. Ryan, 1973-NMSC-097, 85 N.M. 575, 514 P.2d 851.\n\nIrreconcilableness important factor in incompatibility.— Although incompatibility is difficult, if not impossible, to define with exactness, irreconcilableness is an important factor to be considered in deciding incompatibility.State ex rel. DuBois v. Ryan, 1973-NMSC-097, 85 N.M. 575, 514 P.2d 851.\n\nMisconduct, fault or blame not significant if incompatibility exists.— Either husband or wife may secure a divorce on the ground of incompatibility regardless of whether either, both or neither has been guilty of misconduct, and regardless of whether either, both or neither is at fault or to blame. Misconduct, fault or blame is of no significance, if in fact incompatibility exists.State ex rel. DuBois v. Ryan, 1973-NMSC-097, 85 N.M. 575, 514 P.2d 851.\n\nDoctrine of recrimination as defense is abolishedin proceedings where a divorce is sought on the grounds of incompatibility. Henceforth, evidence of any recriminatory act is only admissible to the extent that such act may have weight as proof on the issue of incompatibility as a ground for divorce.Garner v. Garner, 1973-NMSC-067, 85 N.M. 324, 512 P.2d 84;State ex rel. DuBois v. Ryan, 1973-NMSC-097, 85 N.M. 575, 514 P.2d 851.\n\nWife may establish separate residence where incompatibility exists.— Where incompatibility exists a wife is justified, under this act, in establishing a separate residence and domicile from that of her husband even though a divorce decree has not been granted or a divorce proceeding instituted.Bassett v. Bassett, 1952-NMSC-100, 56 N.M. 739, 250 P.2d 487.\n\nIII. CRUEL AND INHUMAN TREATMENT.\n\nPhysical cruelty not essential to support decree.— A finding that a plaintiff established physical cruelty, as for instance, an impairment of health by reason of acts found to constitute cruelty, is not essential to support a decree on the ground of cruelty.Holloman v. Holloman, 1945-NMSC-036, 49 N.M. 288, 162 P.2d 782.\n\nIV. ABANDONMENT.\n\nAdultery subsequent to abandonment as bar to divorce suit.— Adultery by a wife subsequent to abandonment by her husband is bar to the wife's suit for divorce.Chavez v. Chavez, 1935-NMSC-077, 39 N.M. 480, 50 P.2d 264 (decided under prior law).\n\nV. GROUNDS UNDER PRIOR LAWS.\n\nHusband's failure to support.— Where it appeared that a husband had the mental and physical ability to provide for the support of his family, and neglected to do so, or was indifferent, the wife was entitled to a divorce.Taylor v. Taylor, 1915-NMSC-002, 20 N.M. 13, 145 P. 1075 (decided under prior law).\n\nWife convicted of felony and imprisoned.— Where a wife was convicted of a felony, and was legally committed to the warden of the penitentiary, who sent her to the governor who issued to her a conditional pardon, she was \"imprisoned\" within the meaning of this section.Klasner v. Klasner, 1918-NMSC-021, 23 N.M. 627, 170 P. 745 (decided under prior law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Annulment of Marriages in New Mexico: Part II - Proposed Statute,\" see 2 Nat.

      "text": "Whenever the husband and wife have permanently separated and no longer live or cohabit together as husband and wife, either may institute proceedings in the district court for a division of property, disposition of children or alimony, without asking for or obtaining in the proceedings, a dissolution of marriage.\n\nHistory:Laws 1901, ch. 62, § 23; Code 1915, § 2774; C.S. 1929, § 68-502; 1941 Comp., § 25-702; 1953 Comp., § 22-7-2; Laws 1973, ch. 319, § 3.\n\nCross references.— For separation contracts,see40-2-4 to 40-2-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nLaw of Spain and Mexico as basis for interpretation.— Since the civil law of Spain and Mexico served as the model for the statutory law of this state concerning the property rights of husband and wife, that law will be looked to as the basis for interpretation and definition.McDonald v. Senn, 1949-NMSC-020, 53 N.M. 198, 204 P.2d 990, 10 A.L.R.2d 966.\n\nCivil action rather than special proceeding.— This section creates a \"civil action\" rather than a special proceeding, and adds to the equitable jurisdiction of the district courts.Ex parte Sedillo, 1929-NMSC-038, 34 N.M. 98, 278 P. 202.\n\nCourt-sanctioned separations.— New Mexico recognizes court-sanctioned separations. Although this section does not expressly state that the court can grant a legal separation, the outcome is the same.Gilmore v. Gilmore, 1988-NMCA-004, 106 N.M. 788, 750 P.2d 1114, cert. denied. 107 N.M. 16, 751 P.2d 700.\n\nHusband and wife may separate but not divorce by consent.— Husband and wife may permanently separate by consent but may not secure absolute divorce by consent.Poteet v. Poteet, 1941-NMSC-025, 45 N.M. 214, 114 P.2d 91.\n\nExisting present interest of wife in community.— This section recognizes an existing present interest of the wife in the community property during the existence of the matrimonial status.Beals v. Ares, 1919-NMSC-067, 25 N.M. 459, 185 P. 780.\n\nThis section clearly recognizes an existing present interest of the wife in community property during the existence of the matrimonial status.In re Miller's Estate, 1940-NMSC-021, 44 N.M. 214, 100 P.2d 908.\n\nCommunity rights not forfeited by adultery.— This statute does not forfeit the wife's interest in the community property by her adultery, and her rights therein are not affected by any of her wrongs.Beals v. Ares, 1919-NMSC-067, 25 N.M. 459, 185 P. 780.\n\nCommunity rights generally not forfeited by bigamy.— The mere fact of bigamy is insufficient to deprive wife of her share of community property.Medina v. Medina, 2006-NMCA-042, 139 N.M. 309, 131 P.3d 696.\n\nCircumstances when community rights are forfeited by bigamy.— A bigamous spouse should be deprived of his or her community property rights only when the circumstances of the case shock the conscience of the court.Medina v. Medina, 2006-NMCA-042, 139 N.M. 309, 131 P.3d 696.\n\nContempt for failure to pay where separation regarded permanent.— In action under this section where a permanent separation was not expressly alleged, father adjudged in contempt for failure to pay for support of children will not be released on habeas corpus for lack of jurisdiction where the record shows that both parties regarded the separation as permanent.Ex parte Sedillo, 1929-NMSC-038, 34 N.M. 98, 278 P. 202.\n\nAgreement not automatically vacated because only one attorney employed.— The mere fact that attorney was employed by both wife and husband and did advise, to some extent, both of them did not automatically entitle wife to have vacated a predivorce agreement adopted by the trial court as its own division of community property.Hensley v. Zarges, 1971-NMSC-075, 82 N.M. 779, 487 P.2d 481.\n\nError to admit evidence of divorce proceeding where property not considered.— At proceeding to determine property rights of divorced spouses, trial court erred in admitting into evidence an oral statement by the court in the divorce proceedings that the agreement of the parties as to the distribution of their property was ratified and approved, and further erred in making a finding to this effect, where the trial court in the divorce proceeding did not pass upon the property rights of the parties, but such error was harmless where admission of such evidence did not affect the result.Hensley v. Zarges, 1971-NMSC-075, 82 N.M. 779, 487 P.2d 481.\n\nContinuing jurisdiction over custody matters.— As long as a court continues to have jurisdiction over either the children or both parents, it has continuing jurisdiction to hear all matters relating to custody.Murphy v. Murphy, 1981-NMSC-069, 96 N.M. 401, 631 P.2d 307.\n\nThis section gives a court subject matter jurisdiction over matters of custody and visitation whether a dissolution of marriage is requested or not, as long as the parties are personally subject to the jurisdiction of the court.Murphy v. Murphy, 1981-NMSC-069, 96 N.M. 401, 631 P.2d 307.\n\nHabeas corpus as means of determining custodial rights of children.— Under appropriate circumstances, habeas corpus is an available remedy by which to consider controversies involving the issue of custody of infants.Roberts v. Staples, 1968-NMSC-109, 79 N.M. 298, 442 P.2d 788.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Annulment of Marriages in New Mexico: Part II - Proposed Statute,\" see 2 Nat.

In such proceedings, the court shall have jurisdiction of all property of the parties, wherever located or situated in the state.\n\nHistory:Laws 1901, ch. 62, § 24; Code 1915, § 2775; C.S. 1929, § 68-503; 1941 Comp., § 25-703; 1953 Comp., § 22-7-3; Laws 1967, ch. 112, § 1; 1973, ch. 319, § 4.\n\nCompiler's notes.— \"This chapter\" refers to Laws 1973, ch. 319, §§ 1 to 14, compiled as 40-4-1 to 40-4-7, 40-4-10, 40-4-12 to 40-4-14, 40-4-19 and 40-4-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nSection defines powers of court in regard to division of community property.Cauthen v. Cauthen, 1949-NMSC-057, 53 N.M. 458, 210 P.2d 942.\n\nAuthority to void attorneys' charging lien.— In a domestic relations suit, the trial court had authority to void notice of attorneys' charging lien recorded on the parties' residence and to allocate the proceeds, giving priority to the claims of court-appointed experts if the facts and circumstances justified it.Philipbar v. Philipbar, 1999-NMCA-063, 127 N.M. 341, 980 P.2d 1075.\n\nVenue determined from complaint and character of judgment.— Under this section venue is generally determined from the complaint and character of the judgment which may be rendered thereon.Davey v. Davey, 1967-NMSC-002, 77 N.M. 303, 422 P.2d 38.\n\nExclusive jurisdiction over property not indefinite jurisdiction.— A court acquires exclusive jurisdiction over the property involved for purposes of a division of the property, or a modification of the decree as to payments for alimony, maintenance and education of the minor children, but this does not mean that such court may retain such jurisdiction indefinitely or that another court of concurrent jurisdiction may not acquire jurisdiction over the property at a time when the proceeding is apparently settled.Ortiz v. Gonzales, 1958-NMSC-109, 64 N.M. 445, 329 P.2d 1027.\n\nJurisdiction over marital property where stock not disclosed.— Where divorced wife made motion in one division of district court to vacate divorce decree because husband had failed to disclose corporate stock, issuance of order restraining disposition of such stock conferred jurisdiction of the res on the divorce court and subjected stock to the jurisdiction of the court having jurisdiction of the marital status of the parties even though the court did not take actual possession of the res, although execution had issued from another division of district court to be levied on stock to satisfy a judgment against husband.Greathouse v. Greathouse, 1958-NMSC-032, 64 N.M. 21, 322 P.2d 1075.\n\nJurisdiction over separate property.— In proceedings for dissolution of marriage, the trial court has complete jurisdiction over all separate as well as community property located in New Mexico.Trego v.

Davey, 1967-NMSC-002, 77 N.M. 303, 422 P.2d 38.\n\nNo adjudication of property where not sought.— Where plaintiff could have sought a division of the property of the parties in the divorce case but did not do so, and the court did not consider the issue of the property, there was no adjudication thereon.Zarges v. Zarges, 1968-NMSC-151, 79 N.M. 494, 445 P.2d 97.\n\nAdvisory proceeding not necessary in property division.— In seeking an equal division of the community property, advisory proceedings are not necessary but may be employed by the court if they are deemed helpful, since any reasonable means to that end may be used.Cauthen v. Cauthen, 1949-NMSC-057, 53 N.M. 458, 210 P.2d 942.\n\nFirst wife estopped from claiming husband's property in second divorce where jurisdiction acquired.— Where San Miguel court granted divorce decree in February, 1949, retaining jurisdiction of case upon settlement of community property, and husband remarried in August, 1949, and husband and first wife entered into agreement in September, 1949, disposing of undivided interest in hotel, and second wife subsequently filed for and obtained a divorce in Bernalillo court in November, 1950; the fact that first wife's motion for a hearing in the San Miguel court for further proof concerning community property was not made until six months after the divorce decree in second court, and over two years after divorce in first court, she was estopped as against the second wife to claim the agreement was not a transmutation of community property into separate property liable for husband's independent obligations; and until the San Miguel court took some affirmative action, such as a review of the September agreement to determine the equities of the parties therein, the second court could acquire jurisdiction over the sole and separate property of the husband.Ortiz v. Gonzales, 1958-NMSC-109, 64 N.M. 445, 329 P.2d 1027.\n\nLaw reviews.— For symposium, \"Equal Rights in Divorce and Separation,\" see 3 N.M.L. Rev. 118 (1973).\n\nAm.

      "text": "The district court has jurisdiction to decree a dissolution of marriage when at the time of filing the petition either party has resided in this state for at least six months immediately preceding the date of the filing and has a domicile in New Mexico. As used in this section, \"domicile\" means that the person to whom it applies:\n\nA. is physically present in this state and has a place of residence in this state;\n\nB. has a present intention in good faith to reside in this state permanently or indefinitely;\n\nC. provided further, persons serving in any military branch of the United States government who have been continuously stationed in any military base or installation in New Mexico for such period of six months shall, for the purposes hereof, be deemed to have a domicile of the state and county where such military base or installation is located; and\n\nD. provided further, any person who had resided continuously in New Mexico for at least six months immediately prior to his or his spouse's entry into any military branch of the United States government, who is stationed or whose spouse is stationed at any military base or installation outside of New Mexico and who has a present intention in good faith to return and to reside in this state permanently or indefinitely, shall for the purposes hereof, be deemed to have a domicile of the state and county of his residence immediately prior to his or his spouse's entry into the military branch.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 22-7-4, enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 273, § 1; 1973, ch. 319, § 5; 1977, ch. 101, § 1.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nPurpose of requiring domicilewithin the state for a specified period of time as a jurisdictional prerequisite to obtaining a divorce is to prevent divorce-minded couples from shopping for favorable residence requirements.Hagan v. Hardwick, 1981-NMSC-002, 95 N.M. 517, 624 P.2d 26.\n\nThe public policy of protecting innocent parties in divorce actioncannot give substance to a nullity. The policy of New Mexico is that marriage bonds shall be severed only on the basis set forth in the statute.Heckathorn v. Heckathorn, 1967-NMSC-017, 77 N.M. 369, 423 P.2d 410.\n\nThis section is not an attempt to convert divorce into transitory, in personam action,nor is its objective the luring of divorce-shopping couples to this state.Wallace v. Wallace, 1958-NMSC-014, 63 N.M. 414, 320 P.2d 1020.\n\nThis section addresses subject matter jurisdictionand is not concerned with personal jurisdiction over an absent spouse.Worland v. Worland, 1976-NMSC-027, 89 N.M. 291, 551 P.2d 981.\n\nThere are three jurisdictional essentials necessary to validity of every judgment:jurisdiction of parties, jurisdiction of subject matter and power or authority to decide the particular matter presented.Heckathorn v. Heckathorn, 1967-NMSC-017, 77 N.M. 369, 423 P.2d 410.\n\nThis statute grounds jurisdiction on strength of factsconnecting the parties to the state of the forum.Wallace v. Wallace, 1958-NMSC-014, 63 N.M. 414, 320 P.2d 1020.\n\nRight to apply for or obtain divorceis accorded only by statute.Heckathorn v. Heckathorn, 1967-NMSC-017, 77 N.M. 369, 423 P.2d 410.\n\nRight to obtain divorce is purely statutory and it follows that the state may determine who may use its courts for such purpose.Chaney v. Chaney, 1949-NMSC-005, 53 N.M. 66, 201 P.2d 782.\n\nDomicile is prerequisite to divorce jurisdictionnecessary for recognition under the full faith and credit clause.Crownover v. Crownover, 1954-NMSC-092, 58 N.M. 597, 274 P.2d 127.\n\nSince statute's residence requirement not met,the trial court lacked jurisdiction and the decree of divorce was void.Heckathorn v. Heckathorn, 1967-NMSC-017, 77 N.M. 369, 423 P.2d 410.\n\nResidence for required period of time is necessary jurisdictional prerequisiteof divorce in New Mexico, and this jurisdictional prerequisite being absent, the decree of divorce was a nullity.Heckathorn v. Heckathorn, 1967-NMSC-017, 77 N.M. 369, 423 P.2d 410.\n\nSix-month continuous physical presence not required.— There is nothing in the terms of this section indicating a legislative intent to require continuous physical presence within the state for six months prior to initiation of proceedings.Hagan v. Hardwick, 1981-NMSC-002, 95 N.M. 517, 624 P.2d 26.\n\nDivorce jurisdiction can be founded on circumstances other than domicile.Wallace v. Wallace, 1958-NMSC-014, 63 N.M. 414, 320 P.2d 1020.\n\nHolding that a domiciliary intent could be conclusively presumed from a period of residence was tantamount to a repudiation of the theory that domicile is the only jurisdictional basis for divorce.Wallace v. Wallace, 1958-NMSC-014, 63 N.M. 414, 320 P.2d 1020.\n\nIt is within the power of the legislature to establish reasonable bases of jurisdictionfor divorce other than domicile.Wallace v. Wallace, 1958-NMSC-014, 63 N.M. 414, 320 P.2d 1020.\n\nCourt has no discretionary right to deny divorce where statutory ground is shownto exist.Buckner v. Buckner, 1981-NMSC-007, 95 N.M. 337, 622 P.2d 242.\n\nOrders regarding child custody, etc., effective though court without jurisdiction to grant divorce.— Although the parties are not divorced due to the trial court's lack of jurisdiction as required in this section, it does not follow that the provisions pertaining to custody, child support and visitation are void. Where the trial court had jurisdiction over these issues, and no issue on the appeal involved the court's orders concerning the children, the orders of the court pertaining to custody, support and maintenance and visitation remain in effect and are binding on the parties unless modified by further order of the trial court.Heckathorn v. Heckathorn, 1967-NMSC-017, 77 N.M. 369, 423 P.2d 410.\n\nNo deprivation of jurisdiction by cohabitation.— Evidence of cohabitation by the parties after filing a petition for divorce based on incompatibility did not deprive the court of jurisdiction, where the wife did not file an answer to the husband's complaint nor contest his allegation that the parties were in fact incompatible.Joy v. Joy, 1987-NMCA-031, 105 N.M. 571, 734 P.2d 811.\n\nAllegation of residence implies good faith.— An allegation of residence for the required time, in a divorce complaint, necessarily implies residence \"in good faith.\"Klasner v. Klasner, 1918-NMSC-021, 23 N.M. 627, 170 P. 745.\n\nResident of Los Alamos project does not meet residence requirement.— A person who lives within condemned area of Los Alamos project does not meet the residence requirements of this section of the divorce laws.Chaney v. Chaney, 1949-NMSC-005, 53 N.M. 66, 201 P.2d 782.\n\nResidence as question of fact.— The residence requirement specified by this section, although jurisdictional, presents a question of fact for determination by the trial court, and where the trial court makes an affirmative finding of the jurisdictional fact of residence upon evidence which is substantial, the finding will not be overturned.Davey v. Davey, 1967-NMSC-002, 77 N.M. 303, 422 P.2d 38.\n\nMore than mere physical presenceof divorcing couple within state should underlie divorce jurisdiction.Wallace v. Wallace, 1958-NMSC-014, 63 N.M. 414, 320 P.2d 1020.\n\nExistence of residence with domiciliary intent for divorcepurposes is centered upon the \"integrity\" of the intent of the parties concerned.Crownover v. Crownover, 1954-NMSC-092, 58 N.M. 597, 274 P.2d 127.\n\nDecree not subject to collateral attack in sister state.— Divorce decree, wherein the defendant appeared and had an opportunity to question the jurisdiction of the court, may not be attacked by a third party in a sister state since it is not subject to collateral attack in this state.Wallace v. Wallace, 1958-NMSC-014, 63 N.M. 414, 320 P.2d 1020.\n\nParty cannot repudiate court's jurisdiction after obtaining desired relief.— A party cannot invoke the jurisdiction of a court for the purpose of securing important rights from his adversary through its judgment, and, after having obtained the relief desired, repudiate the action of the court on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction.Heckathorn v. Heckathorn, 1967-NMSC-017, 77 N.M. 369, 423 P.2d 410.\n\nAmendment of pleadings to show residence.— Where the required residence of the plaintiff in a divorce suit was omitted from the allegations of the complaint, but was fully litigated, without objection, it may be supplied by amendment of the pleadings on appeal.Canavan v. Canavan, 1913-NMSC-013, 17 N.M. 503, 131 P. 493.\n\nJudgment as coram non judice where plaintiff not resident.— Entry of judgment is coram non judice where the plaintiff is not a bona fide resident of the state since the trial court is without jurisdiction to enter a judgment in such a case.Allen v. Allen, 1948-NMSC-024, 52 N.M. 174, 194 P.2d 270.\n\nJurisdiction over community personalty located on Indian reservation.— A district court has jurisdiction to determine the disposition of community personal property located on an Indian reservation when one of the parties is an Indian, but has submitted to the jurisdiction of the court to dissolve his marriage.Lonewolf v. Lonewolf, 1982-NMSC-152, 99 N.M. 300, 657 P.2d 627, appeal dismissed, 467 U.S. 1223, 104 S. Ct. 2672, 81 L. Ed. 2d 869 (1984).\n\nEvidence sufficient to support jurisdiction.— Where the evidence showed that wife lived in New Mexico for six months by the time she filed her second petition for divorce, and she opened bank accounts here, registered to vote, registered her car, and lived here, such acts demonstrated both her physical presence here and her concurrent intention to make New Mexico her home, and absent any evidence that she established a domicile in some other state when she filed her divorce action, there was no error in the trial court's determination of jurisdiction over wife.Fenner v. Fenner, 1987-NMCA-066, 106 N.M. 36, 738 P.2d 908, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 7, 738 P.2d 125.\n\nII. MILITARY PERSONNEL.\n\nMilitary residence proviso not unconstitutional.— Subsection three of this act (Laws 1951, ch. 107, § 1, now repealed, adding the military residence proviso) is not violative of N.M. Const., art. IV, § 24, prohibiting local or special laws and guaranteeing equal protection of the laws.Crownover v. Crownover, 1954-NMSC-092, 58 N.M. 597, 274 P.2d 127.\n\nLegislature may constitutionally confer status of resident for divorce purposesupon those continuously stationed within this state by reason of military assignment.Wilson v. Wilson, 1954-NMSC-069, 58 N.M. 411, 272 P.2d 319.\n\nProvisions for servicemen not unlawful encroachment on federal jurisdiction.— This section in providing for jurisdiction in New Mexico state courts over divorce proceedings involving servicemen is not an unlawful encroachment on federal jurisdiction.Crownover v. Crownover, 1954-NMSC-092, 58 N.M. 597, 274 P.2d 127.\n\nPresumption of domicile where continuously stationed.— Upon proof of continuous station pursuant to this section, the presumption of domicile is conclusive; however, evidence directed to the issue of continuous station can destroy this presumption.Crownover v. Crownover, 1954-NMSC-092, 58 N.M. 597, 274 P.2d 127.\n\nUpon proof of continuous station pursuant to this section, a conclusive presumption of domicile arises.Wallace v. Wallace, 1958-NMSC-014, 63 N.M. 414, 320 P.2d 1020.\n\nState has substantial interest in service families stationed in the state.— When service families have resided in this jurisdiction for one year (now six months), the state has a substantial interest in their domestic relations.Wallace v. Wallace, 1958-NMSC-014, 63 N.M. 414, 320 P.2d 1020.\n\nContinuously stationed deemed resident with domiciliary intent.— A member of the military \"continuously stationed\" at a base in New Mexico for one year (now six months), for the purposes of this act (Laws 1951, ch. 107, § 1, now repealed), shall be deemed a resident of New Mexico with domiciliary intent, a necessary jurisdictional prerequisite of divorce in New Mexico.Crownover v. Crownover, 1954-NMSC-092, 58 N.M. 597, 274 P.2d 127.\n\nGood faith presumed where continuously stationed.— When a member of the military is here under orders, his \"good faith\" cannot be questioned and will be presumed upon showing that he has been \"continuously stationed\" in the state for the year next preceding the filing of his complaint.Crownover v. Crownover, 1954-NMSC-092, 58 N.M. 597, 274 P.2d 127.\n\nResidency requirements met where individual absent several months.— Where individual has 13 months of permanent station in New Mexico with physical presence during the first seven months, physical absence during the next six months, and then a physical return to New Mexico, he is considered continuously stationed in the military base or installation in the state of New Mexico for one year (now six months) next preceding the filing of his complaint sufficient to satisfy residency requirement of Subsection C to give New Mexico courts jurisdiction in divorce proceedings.Crownover v. Crownover, 1954-NMSC-092, 58 N.M. 597, 274 P.2d 127.\n\nMilitary retirement separate property where no residence established.— Subsection C of this section relates only to the jurisdictional requirement of residence for the maintenance of an action for the dissolution of the bonds of matrimony. Where plaintiff claimed that defendant became domiciled in New Mexico pursuant to the provisions of what is now Subsection C, by reason of being stationed here on two occasions, and that the portion of his military retirement income earned while stationed in this state was thus community property under New Mexico law, although defendant at no time during his many years of military service intended to establish or did establish his domicile or residence in New Mexico, the trial court's holding that defendant's retirement income was his separate property was affirmed.Roebuck v. Roebuck, 1974-NMSC-099, 87 N.M. 96, 529 P.2d 762.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Annulment of Marriages in New Mexico,\" see 1 Nat.

The court may include a specific rehabilitation plan with its award of rehabilitative spousal support and may condition continuation of the support upon compliance with that plan;\n\n(b) transitional spousal support to supplement the income of the receiving spouse for a limited period of time; provided that the period shall be clearly stated in the court's final order;\n\n(c) spousal support for an indefinite duration;\n\n(d) a single sum to be paid in one or more installments that specifies definite amounts, subject only to the death of the receiving spouse; or\n\n(e) a single sum to be paid in one or more installments that specifies definite amounts, not subject to any contingencies, including the death of the receiving spouse;\n\n(a) modify and change any order in respect to spousal support awarded pursuant to the provisions of Subparagraph (a), (b) or (c) of Paragraph (1) of this subsection whenever the circumstances render such change proper; or\n\n(b) designate spousal support awarded pursuant to the provisions of Subparagraph (a) or (b) of Paragraph (1) of this subsection as nonmodifiable with respect to the amount or duration of the support payments;\n\n(3) may set apart out of the property or income of the respective parties such portion for the maintenance and education of:\n\n(a) their unemancipated minor children as may seem just and proper; or\n\n(b) their children until the children's graduation from high school if the children are emancipated only by age, are under nineteen and are attending high school; and\n\n(4) may make such an order for the guardianship, care, custody, maintenance and education of the minor children, or with reference to the control of the property of the respective parties to the proceeding, or with reference to the control of the property decreed or fund created by the court for the maintenance and education of the minor children, as may seem just and proper.\n\nC. The court may order and enforce the payment of support for the maintenance and education after high school of emancipated children of the marriage pursuant to a written agreement between the parties.\n\nD. An award of spousal support made pursuant to the provisions of Subparagraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of Paragraph (1) of Subsection B of this section shall terminate upon the death of the receiving spouse, unless the court order of spousal support provides otherwise.\n\nE. When making determinations concerning spousal support to be awarded pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection B of this section, the court shall consider:\n\n(1) the age and health of and the means of support for the respective spouses;\n\n(2) the current and future earnings and the earning capacity of the respective spouses;\n\n(3) the good-faith efforts of the respective spouses to maintain employment or to become self-supporting;\n\n(4) the reasonable needs of the respective spouses, including:\n\n(a) the standard of living of the respective spouses during the term of the marriage;\n\n(b) the maintenance of medical insurance for the respective spouses; and\n\n(c) the appropriateness of life insurance, including its availability and cost, insuring the life of the person who is to pay support to secure the payments, with any life insurance proceeds paid on the death of the paying spouse to be in lieu of further support;\n\n(5) the duration of the marriage;\n\n(6) the amount of the property awarded or confirmed to the respective spouses;\n\n(7) the type and nature of the respective spouses' assets; provided that potential proceeds from the sale of property by either spouse shall not be considered by the court, unless required by exceptional circumstances and the need to be fair to the parties;\n\n(8) the type and nature of the respective spouses' liabilities;\n\n(9) income produced by property owned by the respective spouses; and\n\n(10) agreements entered into by the spouses in contemplation of the dissolution of marriage or legal separation.\n\nF. The court shall retain jurisdiction over proceedings involving periodic spousal support payments when the parties have been married for twenty years or more prior to the dissolution of the marriage, unless the court order or decree specifically provides that no spousal support shall be awarded.\n\nG. The court may modify and change any order or agreement merged into an order in respect to the guardianship, care, custody, maintenance or education of the children whenever circumstances render such change proper. The district court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all matters pertaining to the guardianship, care, custody, maintenance and education of the children until the parents' obligation of support for their children terminates. The district court shall also have exclusive, continuing jurisdiction with reference to the property decreed or funds created for the children's maintenance and education.\n\nHistory:Laws 1901, ch. 62, § 27; Code 1915, § 2778; C.S. 1929, § 68-506; 1941 Comp., § 25-706; Laws 1943, ch. 46, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 22-7-6; Laws 1973, ch. 319, § 7; 1993, ch. 144, § 1; 1997, ch. 56, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For provisions pertaining to a supervised visitation program,see40-12-5.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor determination of award of child support,see40-4-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor mandatory Medical Support Act,see40-4C-1 to 40-4C-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective June 20, 1997, added Subparagraphs B(3)(a) and B(3)(b) and made related stylistic changes; added Subsection C and redesignated former Subsections C through F as D through G; and in Subsection G, substituted \"until the parents' obligation of support for their children terminates\" for \"so long as the children remain minors\".\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, in Subsection A, substituted \"spousal support\" for \"alimony\" in the first sentence; in Subsection B, rewrote Paragraphs (1) and (2); added present Subsections C through E, redesignating former Subsection C as Subsection F; in Subsection F, rewrote the second sentence as the present third and fourth sentences and deleted the former third sentence, which concerned the disposition of funds remaining when the children reach the age of majority; and made stylistic changes in the second sentence of subsection A and in Paragraph (3) of Subsection B.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nInherent powers of court.— A New Mexico district court has the power to sanction a parent for misconduct that occurred before a South Dakota court where the parent pursued an action in the South Dakota court in an attempt to improperly gain custody of a child, while concealing the New Mexico proceedings from the South Dakota court and for wilful disobedience of a court order for failing to return the child after the South Dakota visitation, as mediated by the parties under an order of the New Mexico district court.Seipert v. Johnson, 2003-NMCA-119, 134 N.M. 394, 77 P.3d 298, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-009, 134 N.M. 374, 77 P.3d 278.\n\nConstruing divorce decrees.— Divorce decrees are to be construed as other written instruments. A district court determination that a written instrument is unambiguous as a matter of law is therefore not binding on the appellate court which may consider the legal effect of the document itself.Schueller v. Schueller, 1994-NMCA-014, 117 N.M. 197, 870 P.2d 159.\n\nThis section does not applyto annulment actions.Panzer v. Panzer, 1974-NMSC-092, 87 N.M. 29, 528 P.2d 888.\n\nThis section has no reference to actions to annul an invalid marriage.Prince v. Freeman, 1941-NMSC-006, 45 N.M. 143, 112 P.2d 821.\n\nThis section does not apply to a nonmodifiable lump sum alimony agreement.Edens v. Edens, 2005-NMCA-033, 137 N.M. 207, 109 P.3d 295, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-003, 137 N.M. 290, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nConflict between decree and statute.— Where there is a conflict between provisions of the divorce decree and a statute of the state of New Mexico, the statute is controlling.Scanlon v. Scanlon, 1955-NMSC-035, 60 N.M. 43, 287 P.2d 238.\n\n\"Either party\"as used in Subsection A of this section can logically only refer to the parties to the underlying domestic relations proceeding, that is, husband and wife.Garcia v. Jeantette, 2004-NMCA-004, 134 N.M. 776, 82 P.3d 947.\n\nExclusive jurisdiction not indefinite jurisdiction.— A court acquires exclusive jurisdiction over the property involved for purposes of a division of the property, or a modification of the decree as to payments for alimony, maintenance and education of the minor children, but this does not mean that such court may retain such jurisdiction indefinitely or that another court of concurrent jurisdiction may not acquire jurisdiction over the property at a time when the proceeding is apparently settled.Ortiz v. Gonzales, 1958-NMSC-109, 64 N.M. 445, 329 P.2d 1027.\n\nFinality of judgment not destroyed by reservation of continuing jurisdiction.— A reservation of continuing jurisdiction by the trial court in divorce proceedings does not destroy the finality of a final judgment, once the judgment is entered. Like any other final award or decision, they are subject to attack only upon a showing of relief provided for under Rules 59 and 60(b), N.M.R. Civ. P. (now 1-059 and 1-060 NMRA).Smith v. Smith, 1982-NMSC-088, 98 N.M. 468, 649 P.2d 1381.\n\nDoctrine of res judicata does not preclude decision from first court.— Where the New Mexico district court entered its final decree and custody award on April 10, more than a week before the Colorado district court entered its decision that the former court lacked jurisdiction, the New Mexico district court could not be precluded by the doctrine of res judicata from entering a decision in the matter.Worland v. Worland, 1976-NMSC-027, 89 N.M. 291, 551 P.2d 981.\n\nJurisdiction of federal courts in bankruptcy proceedings.— Although the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 greatly expanded the jurisdiction of federal courts, jurisdiction over such matters as marriage, divorce, child custody, alimony and child support, remains in state courts.Dirks v. Dirks, 15 Bankr. 775 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1981).\n\nDespite the fact that federal courts do not have jurisdiction to determine domestic relations matters, congress did intend that the bankruptcy courts should be able to determine whether characterizations of alimony or support made by state courts meet the meaning of such terms as they arise in the bankruptcy context.Dirks v. Dirks, 15 Bankr. 775 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1981).\n\nAlimony, child support and maintenance nondischargeable in bankruptcy.— Amounts due a former spouse of the debtor constituting alimony, child support or maintenance are nondischargeable debts so long as such sums are payable directly to the former spouse and actually represent alimony, child support or maintenance.Lekvold v. Henderson, 18 Bankr. 663 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1982).\n\nIf decree is clear and unambiguous,neither pleadings, findings nor matters dehors the record may be used to change its meaning or even to construe it.Chavez v. Chavez, 1971-NMSC-062, 82 N.M. 624, 485 P.2d 735.\n\nModification of divorce decreeis not required except upon a showing of material change of circumstances, but upon a showing of such change of circumstances or new facts it may be done.Tuttle v. Tuttle, 1959-NMSC-063, 66 N.M. 134, 343 P.2d 838.\n\nAttempt to convert divorce suit into action for debt unauthorized.— The attempt of an attorney to convert a divorce suit into an action by him against the wife for debt was wholly unauthorized, and the resulting judgment rendered against her is void.Lloyd v. Lloyd, 1956-NMSC-007, 60 N.M. 441, 292 P.2d 121.\n\nTrial court may order the husband in a divorce action to make a suitable allowance to the wife to the end her case may be adequately presented, but this does not give her attorney the right to recover a judgment against the husband in an independent action.Lloyd v. Lloyd, 1956-NMSC-007, 60 N.M. 441, 292 P.2d 121.\n\nLanguage of section became part of agreement and decree.— The language from this section as it existed at the time the separation agreement was made became a part of the agreement when it became a part of the decree of divorce, even though the parties may not have had knowledge of the existence of the statute.Scanlon v. Scanlon, 1955-NMSC-035, 60 N.M. 43, 287 P.2d 238.\n\nNo presumption that separation agreements fraudulent.— While it is true that if a fiduciary relationship is shown and that as a result of confidence reposed by the one, dominion and influence resulting from such confidence can be exercised by the other, fraud and undue influence may be presumed to exist when an advantage is gained by the dominant party at the expense of the confiding party; nevertheless, the modern trend holds that when a husband and wife have separated or are about to separate and seek by agreement to settle their respective rights and obligations, they deal at arm's length. There is no presumption that separation agreements are fraudulent, and that one who asserts the invalidity of such agreement has the burden of proving that it is tainted by fraud, duress or overreaching.Unser v. Unser, 1974-NMSC-063, 86 N.M. 648, 526 P.2d 790.\n\nSeparation agreement subject to change by court.— A separation agreement in New Mexico, though binding upon the parties during such time as they are separated as husband and wife, when submitted in a divorce case for consideration of the court, is subject to such action as the court in its discretion may take, and the court may disregard any previous agreement for support and make such award as in the discretion of the court may seem just and fair.Scanlon v. Scanlon, 1955-NMSC-035, 60 N.M. 43, 287 P.2d 238.\n\nAuthority to modify child custody or support order.— Trial courts, in proceedings for dissolution of a marriage, have the power and authority to execute, modify or vacate any order involving the guardianship, care, custody, maintenance and education of minor children.Rhinehart v. Nowlin, 1990-NMCA-136, 111 N.M. 319, 805 P.2d 88.\n\nCourt had discretion to fashion installment payment plan.— In a contempt counterclaim by the wife, the trial court had the discretion to fashion an installment payment plan of the husband's debt of child support and alimony arrearages.Corliss v. Corliss, 1976-NMSC-023, 89 N.M. 235, 549 P.2d 1070.\n\nJudgment final despite continuing jurisdiction of court.— The court's reservation of continuing jurisdiction over the parties to modify such matters as alimony, support or custody does not destroy the finality of a judgment.Thornton v. Gamble, 1984-NMCA-093, 101 N.M. 764, 688 P.2d 1268.\n\nAwarding of alimony or child support rests within sound discretion of court.Muckleroy v. Muckleroy, 1972-NMSC-051, 84 N.M. 14, 498 P.2d 1357;Hurley v. Hurley, 1980-NMSC-067, 94 N.M. 641, 615 P.2d 256.\n\nThe decision to grant or deny alimony is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and its decision will be altered only upon a showing of an abuse of that discretion.Ellsworth v. Ellsworth, 1981-NMSC-132, 97 N.M. 133, 637 P.2d 564.\n\nPower to grant alimony and attorney fees.— District court has jurisdiction and power to grant the wife temporary allowance and solicitors' fees, and to enforce payment of them against the husband or his property in the absence of sufficient separate estate belonging to the wife, or to charge them against any common property belonging to both husband and wife, whether such property is in the control of the husband or wife; and where the wife has ample estate of her own she may charge it with necessary solicitors' fees to enable her to prosecute or defend a divorce action to which she is a party, which the court will allow when they are necessary and reasonable.Lamy v. Catron, 1890-NMSC-003, 5 N.M. 373, 23 P. 773 (decided under former law).\n\nAdjustment of property division on remand.— Where, although the wife requested alimony, the trial court found she had failed to show need, and that finding was not challenged on appeal, on remand, the court in its discretion was limited to reconsidering the fairness and equity of the balance of the property division, and making whatever adjustments were necessary to achieve a fair and equitable division and disposition of the parties' property and other interests.Bayer v. Bayer, 1990-NMCA-106, 110 N.M. 782, 800 P.2d 216.\n\nSupreme court has inherent power to make allowance of counsel's feeson appeal of $750 to wife, taxed as costs to defendant-husband, when on appeal the court finds an error in the judgment of the trial court in a suit brought by wife to divide property.Jones v. Jones, 1960-NMSC-106, 67 N.M. 415, 356 P.2d 231.\n\nAn award of attorney's fees was appropriate.— Award of $2,500 in attorney fees to petitioner was warranted on appeal.Rhinehart v. Nowlin, 1990-NMCA-136, 111 N.M. 319, 805 P.2d 88.\n\nEvidence of economic disparity.— The evidence of economic disparity between husband and wife supported the trial court's award of $20,000 in attorney's fees to the wife.Monsanto v. Monsanto, 1995-NMCA-048, 119 N.M. 678, 894 P.2d 1034.\n\nAn award of attorney's fees to the mother was appropriate since the trial court considered the economic disparity between the parties, and considered the father's financial circumstances in reaching its findings regarding his gross monthly income and in allowing him to make installment payments on the award.Alverson v. Harris, 1997-NMCA-024, 123 N.M. 153, 935 P.2d 1165.\n\nAn award of attorneys' fees was inappropriatesince the matter of attorneys' fees had been covered by the original decree, and the present effort to set aside that decree on ill-founded grounds had been unsuccessful.Unser v. Unser, 1974-NMSC-063, 86 N.M. 648, 526 P.2d 790.\n\nJudgment for attorney's fees, costs and travel expenseswas a personal judgment against the husband, and in order to enter such a judgment the trial court must have had personal jurisdiction over the husband for that purpose. Since none of these items are included in the long-arm statute by virtue of which the court had jurisdiction over the nonresident husband to decree a divorce on the issue of custody jurisdiction, the judgment as to attorney's fees, costs and travel expenses was beyond the jurisdiction of the court and was null and void in that respect.Worland v. Worland, 1976-NMSC-027, 89 N.M. 291, 551 P.2d 981.\n\nExcessive attorneys' fees.— In a contested divorce action in which more than one full day was spent in trying the case, which necessitated considerable preparation by appellee's counsel, the court does not feel that an award of $500 for attorneys' fees is so excessive as to require reversal as being an abuse of discretion by the trial court.Moore v. Moore, 1963-NMSC-047, 71 N.M. 495, 379 P.2d 784.\n\nA fee fixed by trial court is a finding not to be disturbedunless patently erroneous as reflecting an abuse of discretion; the reasons which would call for a disturbance of the amount so fixed by a trial court must be very persuasive since the trial court which fixes the fee supposedly has a superior knowledge of the actual services rendered and the charges usually prevailing in the particular locality for such services.Michelson v. Michelson, 1976-NMSC-026, 89 N.M. 282, 551 P.2d 638.\n\nSince fees may be allowed by court husband not liable in independent suit.— Where counsel and suit fees may be allowed by court, the husband is not liable in an independent suit by the wife's attorney for necessary disbursements in the case.LaFollette v. Romero, 1931-NMSC-037, 35 N.M. 509, 2 P.2d 310.\n\nSection broad enough to authorize order to pay appeal costs.— Where decree of divorce has been granted a husband, and the wife appeals, the husband's appeal from an order requiring him to pay the costs of her appeal will be denied, this section being sufficiently broad to authorize such order.Oldham v. Oldham, 1922-NMSC-050, 28 N.M. 163, 208 P. 886,aff'd, 1923-NMSC-064, 28 N.M. 619, 216 P. 497.\n\nAttorney fees at appellate level.— Where husband appeals from a judgment concerning alimony award and where court finds a need for the wife to receive assistance with her lawyer's fees at the appellate level, this section is applicable to provide for an award for attorney's fees incurred on appeal.Miller v. Miller, 1981-NMSC-078, 96 N.M. 497, 632 P.2d 732.\n\nAward reversed absent findings to support it.— Award of costs to father in the amount of $3,000 was reversed, where there were no findings on the factors necessary to support the award.Newhouse v. Chavez, 1988-NMCA-110, 108 N.M. 319, 772 P.2d 353, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 197, 769 P.2d 731 (1989).\n\nConsiderations in awarding attorney fees.— While the award of attorney fees to one spouse is discretionary, the trial court should consider the relative financial status of the parties and the ability of the parties to employ and pay counsel.Foutz v. Foutz, 1990-NMCA-093, 110 N.M. 642, 798 P.2d 592.\n\nWhen denying award is error.— Where a party lacks sufficient funds to pay attorney fees for representation incident to dissolution of marriage or rights incident thereto, and the financial situation of the parties is disparate, it is error to deny an award of reasonable attorney's fees.Sheets v. Sheets, 1987-NMCA-128, 106 N.M. 451, 744 P.2d 924.\n\nII. DIVISION OF PROPERTY.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nStock options.— Unvested stock options that provided a spouse with a valuable right in a contingent benefit were community property.Garcia v. Mayer, 1996-NMCA-61, 122 N.M. 57, 920 P.2d 522.\n\nIrrevocable trust.— When an irrevocable trust is set up for the benefit of third parties and neither spouse is a trustee or has a beneficial interest, a trial court may not dispose of it, even if one or both of the spouses created or funded the trust.Vanderlugt v. Vanderlugt, 2018-NMCA-073.\n\nWhere husband, prior to his marriage to wife, created an irrevocable life insurance trust for the benefit of his children, and where neither spouse was a trustee or had a beneficial interest in the trust, the district court erred in determining that there was a community lien interest in the corpus of the irrevocable trust, because the trust was not owned or controlled by either spouse, husband was not able to access the assets of the trust, was not a beneficiary or a trustee and did not have a property interest in the trust, and wife was also not a beneficiary or a trustee and had no property interest in the trust.Vanderlugt v. Vanderlugt, 2018-NMCA-073.\n\nThe district court did not err in limiting discovery into business interests.— In dissolution of marriage proceedings, where husband claimed that the district court erred in restricting husband's discovery into wife's business interests, the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting discovery where all relevant financial information was already produced by wife.Vanderlugt v. Vanderlugt, 2018-NMCA-073.\n\nExpiration of statutory time.— A final decree of dissolution of marriage, which incorporates a property settlement agreement entered into by the parties, may not be modified under N.M.R. Civ.P. 60(b), NMSA 1978 (now Rule 1-060B NMRA) after the expiration of the statutory time for doing so.Wehrle v. Robison, 1979-NMSC-016, 92 N.M. 485, 590 P.2d 633.\n\nForfeiture unenforceable.— Where a marital settlement agreement provided that the marital residence was awarded to the petitioner, that the petitioner was required to pay the mortgage on the residence, that if the respondent cured the petitioner's failure to pay the mortgage, the respondent could take title to the residence, and that the petitioner had the right to redeem the residence by paying the delinquent amounts to the respondent within thirty days; the agreement did not contain any express language regarding the method of making the redemption payment; the parties had not established a pattern for making the redemption payment; the forfeiture clause did not expressly require actual receipt of the redemption payment by the last day of the redemption period and it did not prohibit payment by mail; the petitioner mailed the redemption payment to the respondent on the last day of the redemption period; the redemption payment was delivered to the respondent after the expiration of the redemption period; the marital residence constituted the major portion of the petitioner's share of the marital assets; there was no indication that the petitioner's failure to pay the mortgage caused the respondent to suffer any prejudice to the respondent's credit; and the parties contemplated that the petitioner would move out of New Mexico after the divorce, the agreement did not contain the clear and unequivocal language required before a forfeiture will be enforced and the mailing of the redemption payment on the last day of the redemption period to the respondent constituted a timely redemption payment.Cortez v. Cortez, 2009-NMSC-008, 145 N.M. 642, 203 P.3d 857,rev'g2007-NMCA-154, 143 N.M. 66, 172 P.3d 615.\n\nPayment by mail.— Depositing a check in the mail on the due date does not constitute payment on that date where the terms of the stipulated judgment did not authorize payment by mail and there was no course of dealing between the parties reflecting an agreement that depositing the payment in the mail constituted payment.Cortez v. Cortez, 2007-NMCA-154, 143 N.M. 66, 172 P.3d 615, cert. granted, 2007-NMCERT-011,rev'd, 2009-NMSC-008, 145 N.M. 642, 203 P.3d 857.\n\nStandard of review.— The district court's decisions in making an equitable division of community property and debts are reviewed for abuses of discretion, but the threshold question of whether a particular asset is community property is a question of law to be reviewed de novo.Arnold v. Arnold, 2003-NMCA-114, 134 N.M. 381, 77 P.3d 285.\n\nJurisdiction over community personalty located on Indian reservation.— A district court has jurisdiction to determine the disposition of community personal property located on an Indian reservation when one of the parties is an Indian, but has submitted to the jurisdiction of the court to dissolve his marriage.Lonewolf v. Lonewolf, 1982-NMSC-152, 99 N.M. 300, 657 P.2d 627, appeal dismissed, 467 U.S. 1223, 104 S. Ct. 2672, 81 L. Ed. 2d 869 (1984).\n\nReviewing court indulges in all inferences in favor of successful party.— In determining whether trial court's findings of fact in dispute over division of property are supported by substantial evidence, reviewing court resolves all disputed facts and indulges in all reasonable inferences in favor of the successful party and disregards inferences to the contrary.Lahr v. Lahr, 1970-NMSC-165, 82 N.M. 223, 478 P.2d 551.\n\nCourt should consider tax consequenceswhen deciding a property settlement upon dissolution of marriage.Cunningham v. Cunningham, 1981-NMSC-087, 96 N.M. 529, 632 P.2d 1167;Schueller v. Schueller, 1994-NMCA-014, 117 N.M. 197, 870 P.2d 159.\n\nIt is the duty of court to divide equally property of community.Michelson v. Michelson, 1974-NMSC-022, 86 N.M. 107, 520 P.2d 263;Fitzgerald v. Fitzgerald, 1962-NMSC-028, 70 N.M. 11, 369 P.2d 398;Ellsworth v. Ellsworth, 1981-NMSC-132, 97 N.M. 133, 637 P.2d 564.\n\nBurden to show property was separate.— The burden was on appellant to show what portion of the property before the court resulted from his separate property.Krattiger v. Krattiger, 1969-NMSC-170, 81 N.M. 59, 463 P.2d 35.\n\nAuthority to apportion or set apart property.— This section does not authorize the court to apportion the community property between the spouses in its discretion, but authorized the court to set apart out of the property such portion of the property of the parties as may be required for the support, maintenance and education of the children, and to set apart such part of the husband's property as alimony as may be necessary for the support and maintenance of the wife.Beals v. Ares, 1919-NMSC-067, 25 N.M. 459, 185 P. 780.\n\nAward of property to wife.— In a divorce action, the court has the right to award to the wife a suitable portion of the common property of the community, or the separate property of the husband.Oberg v. Oberg, 1931-NMSC-051, 35 N.M. 601, 4 P.2d 918;Hodges v. Hodges, 1916-NMSC-064, 22 N.M. 192, 159 P. 1007.\n\nProperty takes status as community or separate at time and by manner of acquisition.— Property acquired in New Mexico takes its status as community or separate property at the time and by the manner of its acquisition; and if a part of the purchase money is later paid by other funds than those of the owner of the property, whether of the community or an individual spouse, the owner is indebted to the source of such funds in that amount, but such payment does not effect the title of the purchaser.Michelson v. Michelson, 1976-NMSC-026, 89 N.M. 282, 551 P.2d 638.\n\nWife's share of separate property.— The wife's rights to share in the husband's separate property invested in New Mexico, but which was accumulated from his earnings during their marriage while domiciled in a noncommunity property state, necessitates the characterization of the property as separate, to be made under the applicable laws of the noncommunity property state.Hughes v. Hughes, 1978-NMSC-002, 91 N.M. 339, 573 P.2d 1194.\n\nDetermining interest in property.— The general conflict of laws rule by which an interest in property takes its character at the time and in the manner of its acquisition has not been superseded by the Community Property Act.Blackwell v. Lurie, 2003-NMCA-082, 134 N.M. 1, 71 P.3d 509, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 123, 73 P.3d 826.\n\nIf any doubt court may hold property as community.— When entertaining an ultimate doubt as to whether property is separate or community, the trial court may resolve the doubt by holding the property to be community, if acquired after marriage and the trial court may, subject to review, set over real estate to the wife in lieu of alimony.Loveridge v. Loveridge, 1948-NMSC-044, 52 N.M. 353, 198 P.2d 444.\n\nCommunity property becomes separate property when divided by divorce.— When community property is divided incident to divorce, the property which previously was community estate, becomes thenceforth separate property of the respective parties.Harper v. Harper, 1950-NMSC-024, 54 N.M. 194, 217 P.2d 857.\n\nJudgment creditor may look to community property for satisfaction of judgment.— Either party to a divorce action may bring in third parties who claim an interest in the property alleged to be community, or third parties themselves may intervene and have their rights therein determined.Greathouse v. Greathouse, 1958-NMSC-032, 64 N.M. 21, 322 P.2d 1075.\n\nWhen creditor intervenes in divorce proceeding to assert interestin property, the court in the interest of protecting the children may not negative or disregard legal obligations, or relieve property from a valid claim presented against it.Malcolm v. Malcolm, 1965-NMSC-138, 75 N.M. 566, 408 P.2d 143.\n\nPredivorce creditor unaffected by marital settlement agreement.— While a marital settlement agreement affects the rights and liabilities of husband and wife between themselves, it has no effect upon the rights of a predivorce creditor who was not a party to the agreement; therefore, a wife who joined her husband on a share-draft account and open-end account remains obligated under the terms of those contracts.N.M. Educators Fed. Credit Union v. Woods, 1984-NMSC-101, 102 N.M. 16, 690 P.2d 1010.\n\nApportioning assets and liabilities between parties.— In apportioning a husband and wife's assets and liabilities, the trial court must attempt to perform an allocation that is fair under all the circumstances.Fernandez v. Fernandez, 1991-NMCA-001, 111 N.M. 442, 806 P.2d 582.\n\nThe court's power to apportion assets in an equitable manner should also include the ability to give effect to the parties' intentions, whether or not the parties strictly comply with the community property or debt statutes.Fernandez v. Fernandez, 1991-NMCA-001, 111 N.M. 442, 806 P.2d 582.\n\nSocial Security benefits.— Social Security benefits are considered separate property and cannot be used to set off an equal distribution of community property upon divorce.English v. English, 1994-NMCA-090, 118 N.M. 170, 879 P.2d 802, cert. denied, 118 N.M. 256, 880 P.2d 867.\n\nSeparate property value enhanced due to community labor.— The community is entitled to a lien against the separate property of a spouse for the enhanced value of such property attributable to community labor during marriage.Smith v. Smith, 1992-NMCA-080, 114 N.M. 276, 837 P.2d 869.\n\nWhere there has been an increase during marriage in the value of a business held as the separate property of a spouse, due in part to community efforts and labor, any undercompensation of one or both spouses employed by the business is a factor which may properly be considered in determining whether a community lien should be imposed against such property; ascertaining the amount of comparable wages for the value of community labor performed on behalf of such business is an appropriate method of determining whether the value of such labor has been fairly compensated.Smith v. Smith, 1992-NMCA-080, 114 N.M. 276, 837 P.2d 869.\n\nApportioning income between personal efforts and separate property.— In apportioning assets between a spouse's separate estate and the community, each case must be determined with reference to its surrounding facts and circumstances to determine what amount of the income is due to personal efforts of the spouses and what is attributable to the separate property employed; dependent upon the nature of the business and the risks involved, it must be reckoned what would be a fair return on the capital investment as well as determined what would be a fair allowance for the personal services rendered.Michelson v. Michelson, 1976-NMSC-026, 89 N.M. 282, 551 P.2d 638.\n\nApportionment does not require mathematical exactness but all circumstances considered.— It is impossible to lay down hard and fast guidelines in apportioning assets between the separate estate of a conjugal partner and the community; the surrounding circumstances must be carefully considered as each case will depend upon its own facts, and the ultimate answer will call into play the nicest and most profound judgment of the trial court. Mathematical exactness is not expected or required, but substantial justice can be accomplished by the exercise of reason and judgment in all such cases.Michelson v. Michelson, 1976-NMSC-026, 89 N.M. 282, 551 P.2d 638.\n\nEven if the dollar amount of the property distribution is unequal, there is no requirement that each party receive exactly the same dollar value as long as the community property is equally apportioned by a method of division best suited under the circumstances.Ridgway v. Ridgway, 1980-NMSC-055, 94 N.M. 345, 610 P.2d 749;Cunningham v. Cunningham, 1981-NMSC-087, 96 N.M. 529, 632 P.2d 1167.\n\nCommunity lien not disturbed.— Where the only separate funds of the husband used in the family home was the sum paid for the lot upon which it was constructed, and the evidence showed that the parties expended a considerable sum on the home after its completion (although whether community or separate funds were used for that purpose was unclear), that a few mortgage payments were made from community funds, that refinancing of the mortgage was accomplished by a note and mortgage signed by both the husband and wife and that the community credit was pledged thereby, and that both parties expended considerable time and effort in making improvements, and there was no attempt to trace the separate funds of the husband into the expenditures for the home after completion, the trial court's conclusion that the community had a lien of one half of the difference between the original land price and the mortgage balance attributable to community expenditures of time, effort and money (as opposed to normal appreciations) would not be disturbed.Michelson v. Michelson, 1976-NMSC-026, 89 N.M. 282, 551 P.2d 638.\n\nCommunity does not acquire interest in corporation.— Where the husband was paid for his services to a corporation in which he owned a one-half interest which salary of course belonged to the community, and there was no proof in the record that the salary was not adequate or reasonable under the circumstances, having started at $7,500 in 1964 when he returned from college and increased to $35,000 in 1972, the trial court erred in concluding that the community had acquired an interest in the corporation.Michelson v. Michelson, 1976-NMSC-026, 89 N.M. 282, 551 P.2d 638.\n\nModification of judgment.— The only way an unmodifiable judgment of property settlement may be modified or set aside is by appeal or pursuant to a motion for relief from judgment.Russell v. Russell, 1987-NMCA-085, 106 N.M. 133, 740 P.2d 127.\n\nWife's interest in community property not forfeited by adultery.— This section does not forfeit the wife's interest in the community property by her adultery, and her rights therein are not affected by any of her wrongs.Beals v. Ares, 1919-NMSC-067, 25 N.M. 459, 185 P. 780.\n\nFirst wife estopped against claiming husband's property in second divorce.— Where San Miguel court granted divorce decree in February, 1949, retaining jurisdiction of case upon settlement of community property, and husband remarried in August, 1949, and husband and first wife entered into agreement in September, 1949, disposing of undivided interest in hotel, and second wife subsequently filed for and obtained a divorce in Bernalillo court in November, 1950; the fact that first wife's motion for a hearing in the San Miguel court for further proof concerning community property was not made until six months after the divorce decree in second court, and over two years after divorce in first court, she was estopped as against the second wife to claim the agreement was not a transmutation of community property into separate property liable for husband's independent obligations; and until the San Miguel court took some affirmative action, such as a review of the September agreement to determine the equities of the parties therein, the second court could acquire jurisdiction over the sole and separate property of the husband.Ortiz v. Gonzales, 1958-NMSC-109, 64 N.M. 445, 329 P.2d 1027.\n\nProviding for husband's share where house left to wife.— Where the net effect of leaving the home to the wife until she remarries or dies or decides to sell it is to divest the husband of his equity in the property, the trial court should order the house sold and the net proceeds distributed to the parties within a reasonable time, or make such other disposition of the home as will result in the husband receiving, within a reasonable time, his share of the value of the home.Chrane v. Chrane, 1982-NMSC-089, 98 N.M. 471, 649 P.2d 1384.\n\nModification of original property division.— Apart from the exceptions to the general rule contained in this section and Rule 60(b), N.M.R. Civ. P., once the time has lapsed within which an appeal may be taken from a divorce decree, a court cannot change the original division of the property as an exercise of its continuing jurisdiction.Higginbotham v. Higginbotham, 1979-NMSC-003, 92 N.M. 412, 589 P.2d 196.\n\nProperty division not supported where court did not pass on question of property.— In divorce proceeding where the court was neither requested nor did it pass upon any question of the property rights of the parties, neither can the action of the trial court in adjudicating the right to community property be supported as an exercise of its continuing jurisdiction under this section.Zarges v. Zarges, 1968-NMSC-151, 79 N.M. 494, 445 P.2d 97.\n\nB. VALUATION.\n\nOpinion of owner as to value.— In divorce proceedings, an owner is entitled to give opinion as to value of community property.Lahr v. Lahr, 1970-NMSC-165, 82 N.M. 223, 478 P.2d 551.\n\nPrior to enactment of rules of evidence, where spouse did not testify as to value of certain community property in divorce action, an accountant's deposition statements as to what were claimed to be the spouse's personal opinion as that value were improperly admitted, because even if those values were those of the defendant, the accountant's deposition testimony was hearsay, being the testimony of a witness as to out-of-court statements of a declarant who was not a witness as to that specific subject matter.Lahr v. Lahr, 1970-NMSC-165, 82 N.M. 223, 478 P.2d 551.\n\nCourt to accept valuation of property by one spouse.— Where the only admissible evidence as to the value of certain community property was the valuation of one spouse, the trial court was required to accept this valuation in making its allocation of the community property since there was no direct evidence of spouse's lack of veracity or bad moral character, testimony contained no inherent improbabilities, nor was it surrounded by suspicious circumstances, so that legitimate inferences could be drawn therefrom to cast doubt on the accuracy of that testimony.Lahr v. Lahr, 1970-NMSC-165, 82 N.M. 223, 478 P.2d 551.\n\nApportionment of separate property.— Apportionment is appropriate whenever community labor or community funds have enhanced the value of separate property. No one method of apportionment is favored above all others. The trial court may use whatever method will achieve substantial justice and is supported by substantial evidence in the record.Trego v. Scott, 1998-NMCA-080, 125 N.M. 323, 961 P.2d 168, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 322, 961 P.2d 167.\n\nReview of value of community property.— Where supreme court examined the record and found substantial support for the value of certain community property fixed by the court, as well as for the amount offered by the appellee, both in appellee's testimony and that of an expert appraiser who testified on her behalf, it would not disturb the court's findings.Krattiger v. Krattiger, 1969-NMSC-170, 81 N.M. 59, 463 P.2d 35.\n\nDetermination of present value of profit-sharing plan as community asset.— Where evidence failed to show an ascertainable future benefit from which the trial court could make a determination of the present value of a noncontributory profit-sharing plan, the court correctly used the undiscounted current, actual value of the plan at the date of the divorce in determining its division as a community asset upon divorce.Ridgway v. Ridgway, 1980-NMSC-055, 94 N.M. 345, 610 P.2d 749.\n\nValue of community interest in separate property.— A method of apportionment to give the separate property owner a fair return on the owner's investment is to determine the value of the separate property at the date of marriage, add interest that a well-secured, long-term investment would have earned to the pre-marriage value of the separate property, the resulting sum is the separate property interest, determine the fair market value of the separate property as of the date of divorce, and apportion the fair market value of the separate property as of the date of divorce by giving the separate property owner an interest equal to the separate property interest and giving the community the balance of the fair market value.Dorbin v. Dorbin, 1986-NMCA-114, 105 N.M. 263, 731 P.2d 959;Trego v. Scott, 1998-NMCA-080, 125 N.M. 323, 961 P.2d 168, cert. denied 125 N.M. 322, 961 P.2d 167.\n\nApportionment of separate and community interests.— In the apportionment of separate and community interests in separate property that has been enhanced by community efforts, the court may consider fair market value or equity and use a rate of return on the fair market value or on the equity, in its discretion, recognizing that the two rates would be different and considering appropriate data to determine what the applicable percentage would be.Trego v. Scott, 1998-NMCA-080, 125 N.M. 323, 961 P.2d 168, cert. denied 125 N.M. 322, 961 P.2d 167.\n\nC. RETIREMENT BENEFITS.\n\nContingent retirement benefits.— A spouse's entitlement to half of the community interest in a pension plan earned during coverture does not rest upon whether the employee's interest was vested at the time of divorce, but whether the employee's rights in the pension constitute a property interest or right obtained with community funds or labor, while rights to benefits under the retirement plan may never vest or mature due to circumstances and unforeseeable occurrences, the spouse is entitled to have the spouse's portion of the contingent interest valued and divided.Berry v. Meadows, 1986-NMCA-002, 103 N.M. 761, 713 P.2d 1017.\n\nDivision of future disability benefits.— To the extent the community contributed, a husband's future federal civil service disability benefits are community property subject to division upon dissolution of a marriage.Hughes v. Hughes, 1981-NMSC-110, 96 N.M. 719, 634 P.2d 1271, superseded by statute,Koppenhaver v. Koppenhaver, 1984-NMCA-017, 101 N.M. 105, 678 P.2d 1180.\n\nRetirement benefits.— The rule for distribution of a nonemployee spouse's interest in a retirement plan, whatever the rule is, should be applied only in the absence of an agreement between the spouses on the subject.Ruggles v. Ruggles, 1993-NMSC-043, 116 N.M. 52, 860 P.2d 182.\n\nThe \"lump sum\" method is the preferable one for satisfying the nonemployee spouse's claim to her community interest in her spouse's retirement plan, and the trial court should have discretion in implementing that method, alone or in combination with other methods, including (in an appropriate case) the \"reserved jurisdiction\" method, in distributing the nonemployee spouse's interest upon dissolution.Ruggles v. Ruggles, 1993-NMSC-043, 116 N.M. 52, 860 P.2d 182.\n\nApplying retirement penalties.— Absent an express agreement by the parties to the contrary, the only retirement penalties to be imposed against the nonemployee spouse's share of the pension being distributed pursuant to a \"pay-as-it-comes in\" method are those penalties that were actually applied to calculate the employee spouse's pension benefits, not any hypothetical penalties.Franklin v. Franklin, 1993-NMCA-077, 116 N.M. 11, 859 P.2d 479, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 795, 858 P.2d 1274.\n\nValue of fully vested pension.— When the community interest in a pension is fully vested and matured, the trial court should value the retirement benefits as a whole, including the value of the survivor's benefit provision of the retirement plan, and consider such value in apportioning each party's share of the total retirement benefits.Irwin v. Irwin, 1996-NMCA-007, 121 N.M. 266, 910 P.2d 342.\n\nEffect of timing of receipt of retirement benefits.— Where the parties entered into a marital settlement agreement which provided for the payment of a share of respondent's retirement benefits to petitioner; the marital settlement agreement was silent as to when petitioner was entitled to receive retirement benefits; respondent, who was employed by the United States Post Office, became eligible for retirement under federal retirement law in December 2005; the district court found that the parties knew and anticipated that respondent would be eligible for retirement in December 2005, that if petitioner were entitled to receive retirement benefits only when respondent actually retired, respondent would be in absolute control of when petitioner would receive petitioner's share of the retirement benefits, and that respondent failed to show that there was any discussion, negotiation, or agreement that petitioner would be paid a share of the retirement benefits only when respondent actually retired, the district court's determination that petitioner was entitled to receive a share of retirement benefits beginning in December 2005 was supported by substantial evidence.Garcia v. Garcia, 2010-NMCA-014, 147 N.M. 652, 227 P.3d 621, cert. quashed, 2010-NMCERT-007, 148 N.M. 610, 241 P.3d 611.\n\nRetirement benefits calculation.— Where the parties entered into a marital settlement agreement which provided for the payment of a share of respondent's retirement benefits to petitioner; the parties were divorced in 1994 and respondent became eligible for retirement in 2005; the marital settlement agreement provided for a pay-as-it-comes-in approach to distribution; the marital settlement agreement was ambiguous as to the point in time when petitioner's benefits were to be valued; the marital settlement agreement provided a formula to determine petitioner's share of the retirement benefits; the formula consisted of a fraction, the denominator of which was the total number of months of credited service at respondent's retirement, instead of the total number of months of credited service as of the date of divorce; the marital settlement agreement also provided that respondent was to receive one-half of the community interest in respondent's retirement plan through the date of August 31, 1994, and that respondent was to receive one-half of the community interest in respondent's retirement plan and all of the interest respondent accrued in the retirement plan prior to the party's marriage and subsequent to August 31, 1994, the district court did not err by determining that the benefits payable to petitioner should be calculated based on respondent's average salaries at the time of retirement eligibility, as opposed to at the time of divorce, because the formula was consistent with the time rule which is customarily applied for distribution of benefits in a manner that calls for benefits valuation at the time of retirement eligibility.Garcia v. Garcia, 2010-NMCA-014, 147 N.M. 652, 227 P.3d 621, cert. quashed, 2010-NMCERT-007, 148 N.M. 610, 241 P.3d 611.\n\nPresent value of retirement benefits.— The value of a spouse's vested right in a defined benefit pension plan was correctly determined to be the actuarial present value of the benefit the spouse would be entitled to receive upon the plan's maturity date, taking into account monetary contributions and current pension entitlement accrued during coverture and based on the employee's current salary.Mattox v. Mattox, 1987-NMCA-021, 105 N.M. 479, 734 P.2d 259.\n\nMilitary retirement benefits are community propertyfor purposes of distribution of property upon divorce.Walentowski v. Walentowski, 1983-NMSC-097, 100 N.M. 484, 672 P.2d 657.\n\nThe federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act, which allows each state to determine the marital property status of military retirement benefits, should be given retroactive application to the date of the decision inMcCarty v. McCarty, 453 U.S. 210 (June 25, 1980).Walentowski v. Walentowski, 1983-NMSC-097, 100 N.M. 484, 672 P.2d 657.\n\nWaived military retirement pay may not be treated as property divisible upon divorce.— Federal law preempts any state from treating as \"property divisible upon divorce\" military retirement pay that has been waived in order to receive veteran's disability benefits.Russ v. Russ, 2021-NMSC-014,rev'g2020-NMCA-008.\n\nNew Mexico courts must apply federal law, not state law, to determine the retroactivity of a federal rule related to military retirement.— Where husband's and wife's 2006 marriage settlement agreement provided that husband had an interest in his retired military pay, which is divisible in divorce proceedings, and stipulated that wife shall receive fifty percent of husband's disposable retired pay which was earned during the term of the parties' marriage, and where eight years later, husband waived his entitlement to retired military pay in order to instead receive Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC), a disability benefit, thereby eliminating wife's monthly percentage of husband's retirement pay, and where the New Mexico court of appeals determined that the United States supreme court's decision in Howell v. Howell, 137 S.Ct. 1400 (2017), permitted husband's unilateral election to receive CRSC in lieu of retired pay and prohibited a district court from treating as \"property divisible upon divorce\" military retirement pay that has been waived to receive veterans' disability, but further determined that Howell announced a new rule of federal law that does not apply retroactively in New Mexico, the court of appeals erred in denying retroactive application of Howell because when a new federal rule of law is announced by the United States supreme court in a civil case, it always applies retroactively; federal law does not allow states to apply their own law to supplant a rule of federal law.Russ v. Russ, 2021-NMSC-014,rev'g2020-NMCA-008.\n\nNew principle of law related to military retirement pay not applied retroactively.— Where, upon husband and wife's divorce, the parties entered into a marital settlement agreement (MSA) providing wife with fifty percent of husband's disposable retirement pay which was earned during the term of their marriage, and where, eight years after the divorce, husband waived his retirement pay in order to receive disability-based combat related special compensation, thereby eliminating wife's monthly percentage of husband's retirement pay, the district court's order requiring husband to pay wife what they agreed to in the MSA was inconsistent with the United States supreme court's recent decision inHowell v. Howell, 137 S.Ct. 1400 (2017), which held that a state court's capacity to order reimbursement or indemnification of post-divorce waived retirement pay in an effort to restore past marital settlement agreements or its own past order dividing marital assets is expressly preempted, and therefore, impermissible in New Mexico.Howell, however, establishes a new principle of law by abrogating established New Mexico precedent that protects a wife's interest, awarded by decree, in her husband's military retirement benefits, and retroactive application ofHowellwould unjustly and inequitably undo significant provisions of marital settlement agreements that were based on New Mexico precedent.Russ v. Russ, 2020-NMCA-008, cert. granted.\n\nIndemnity provision.— Federal law does not prohibit state courts from enforcing indemnity provisions which ensure the payment of a minimum sum to a non-military spouse as the spouse's share of a community pension, provided that veteran's disability benefits are not specified as the source of such payments.Scheidel v. Scheidel, 2000-NMCA-059, 129 N.M. 223, 4 P.3d 670.\n\nNondisability military retirement pay is separate propertyof the spouse who is entitled to receive it, and it is not subject to division upon dissolution of marriage.Espinda v. Espinda, 1981-NMSC-098, 96 N.M. 712, 634 P.2d 1264, superseded by statute,Ruggles v. Ruggles, 1993-NMSC-043, 116 N.M. 52, 860 P.2d 182.\n\nNondisability military retirement pay.— That part ofEspinda v. Espinda, 1981-NMSC-098, 96 N.M. 712, 634 P.2d 1264, holding that the character of nondisability military retirement benefits is separate property is superseded to the extent authorized by 10 U.S.C. § 1408.Walentowski v. Walentowski, 1983-NMSC-097, 100 N.M. 484, 672 P.2d 657.\n\nDisposition of retirement or pension benefits.— To dispose of retirement or pension benefits in a divorce proceeding, the trial court should make a determination of the present value of the unmatured pension benefits with a division of assets which includes this amount, or divide the pension on a \"pay as it comes in\" system. This way, if the community has sufficient assets to cover the value of the pension, an immediate division would make a final disposition; but if the pension is the only valuable asset of the community and the employee spouse could not afford to deliver either goods or property worth the other spouse's interest, then the trial court may award the nonemployee spouse his/her portion as the benefits are paid.Copeland v. Copeland, 1978-NMSC-011, 91 N.M. 409, 575 P.2d 99.\n\nIII. RESTRAINING PROPERTY USE.\n\nRestraining order application confers jurisdiction over property.— Application for a restraining order to prevent husband or wife from disposing of community property effectively confers jurisdiction over the property on the court, while mere institution of divorce proceedings will not.Lohbeck v. Lohbeck, 1963-NMSC-071, 72 N.M. 78, 380 P.2d 825.\n\nOrder restraining disposition of stock conferred jurisdiction.— Where divorced wife made motion in one division of district court to vacate divorce decree because husband had failed to disclose corporate stock, issuance of order restraining disposition of such stock conferred jurisdiction of the res on the divorce court and subjected stock to the jurisdiction of the court having jurisdiction of the marital status of the parties even though the court did not take actual possession of the res, although execution had issued from another division of district court to be levied on stock to satisfy a judgment against husband.Greathouse v. Greathouse, 1958-NMSC-032, 64 N.M. 21, 322 P.2d 1075.\n\nTransferring community property during pendency of divorce.— Action by husband of transferring certain community property of which he was principal stockholder, during pendency of a divorce action, does not constitute actionable contempt.Lohbeck v. Lohbeck, 1963-NMSC-071, 72 N.M. 78, 380 P.2d 825.\n\nIV. ALLOWING AND MODIFYING ALIMONY.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nPurpose of alimony.— Alimony is not intended to constitute a penalty imposed upon a husband, but that it is a personal right intended for the purpose of one spouse supporting the other after losing sustenance and the support of coverture, although alimony is not to be condoned when it amounts to one spouse abdicating that spouse's responsibility to support and maintain themselves.Lovato v. Lovato, 1982-NMSC-052, 98 N.M. 11, 644 P.2d 525.\n\nSubsection F of this section is construed to mean what it says.— In cases in which the marriage lasted twenty or more years, the court must retain jurisdiction to consider spousal support when the final decree was silent as to such support.Rhoades v. Rhoades, 2004-NMCA-020, 135 N.M. 122, 85 P.3d 246.\n\nSubsection F provides express authorityfor a district court to award spousal support.Rhoades v. Rhoades, 2004-NMCA-020, 135 N.M. 122, 85 P.3d 246.\n\nReduction in spouse's share of military retirement benefits.— Subsection F of this section is read to permit the award of spousal support where the cause for the award develops from financial inequity resulting from a reduction in a spouse's share of military retirement benefits due to an increase in disability benefits.Rhoades v. Rhoades, 2004-NMCA-020, 135 N.M. 122, 85 P.3d 246.\n\nEffect of bankruptcy court's action.— Where the district court had independent statutory authority on which to award spousal support, a bankruptcy court's factual findings, legal conclusions, and judgment had no preclusive effect.Rhoades v. Rhoades, 2004-NMCA-020, 135 N.M. 122, 85 P.3d 246.\n\nNeed is first criteria in determining alimony.Weaver v. Weaver, 1983-NMSC-063, 100 N.M. 165, 667 P.2d 970; Lebeck v. Lebeck, 1994-NMCA-103, 118 N.M. 367, 881 P.2d 727.\n\nAlimony is personal right and not a property right,and as such, it would not continue without end if the circumstances have changed due to the passage of time, and the recipient is able to support herself.McClure v. McClure, 1976-NMSC-042, 90 N.M. 23, 559 P.2d 400;Brister v. Brister, 1979-NMSC-038, 92 N.M. 711, 594 P.2d 1167.\n\nThe right of alimony is a continuation of the right to support, and is a personal and not a property right.Hazelwood v. Hazelwood, 1976-NMSC-074, 89 N.M. 659, 556 P.2d 345;Brister v. Brister, 1979-NMSC-038, 92 N.M. 711, 594 P.2d 1167.\n\nRight to alimony under New Mexico case law is a continuation of the right to support and is personal and not a property right.Cain v. Cain, 1978-NMSC-014, 91 N.M. 423, 575 P.2d 607.\n\nRight to alimony is continuation of right to support.— It is a personal and not a property right. In New Mexico this right is recognized, but it is not an absolute right. The award or denial of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the trial court in making a determination as to what is just and proper under the circumstances.Burnside v. Burnside, 1973-NMSC-091, 85 N.M. 517, 514 P.2d 36.\n\nPurpose of alimony.— Alimony is the support which a court decrees in favor of either party as a substitute for, and in lieu of, the common-law or statutory right to marital support during coverture.Chavez v. Chavez, 1971-NMSC-062, 82 N.M. 624, 485 P.2d 735.\n\nAlimony provisions severable from property settlement provisions.— The provisions of a divorce decree regarding alimony are entirely severable from the provisions as to property settlement.Brister v. Brister, 1979-NMSC-038, 92 N.M. 711, 594 P.2d 1167.\n\nAppellate court only examines evidence to determine abuse of discretion.— The court in a divorce action is authorized by the statutes to allow the wife such a reasonable portion of the husband's separate property, or such a reasonable sum of money to be paid by the husband, either in a single sum, or in installments, as alimony, as under the circumstances of the case may seem just and proper; and may modify and change any order in respect to alimony allowed the wife, whenever circumstances render such change proper; therefore, on appeal, an appellate court will only examine the evidence to determine whether there was an abuse of discretion in fixing an amount which was contrary to all reason.Michelson v. Michelson, 1974-NMSC-022, 86 N.M. 107, 520 P.2d 263;Michelson v. Michelson, 1976-NMSC-026, 89 N.M. 282, 551 P.2d 638.\n\nThe district court acted within its discretion in denying interim support.— In a divorce proceeding, where wife appealed the district court's characterization of assets and debts as separate or community property and the court's division of marital assets and debts between her and husband, and where wife claimed that she was entitled to interim support and that the district court's decision to deny her those funds was without support in the record, the district court did not abuse its discretion in choosing to equitably divide the parties' community debts and assets rather than awarding wife interim support, based on findings that wife's calculation of her expenses during the course of the litigation, and her list of the community debts she had allegedly paid, were not credible and lacked supporting evidence and that wife's income was substantial and was going to continue after the decree was entered. Wife failed to show that the district court's reasons for denying interim spousal support were either unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence.Autrey v. Autrey, 2022-NMCA-042, cert. granted.\n\nReview of alimony award.— In considering an award of alimony, the supreme court examines the record only to determine if the trial court abused its discretion by fixing an amount that was contrary to all reason.Psomas v. Psomas, 1982-NMSC-154, 99 N.M. 606, 661 P.2d 884;Howard v. Howard, 1983-NMSC-050, 100 N.M. 105, 666 P.2d 1252;overruled in part byWalentowski v. Walentowski, 1983-NMSC-097, 100 N.M. 484, 672 P.2d 657; Gallemore v. Gallemore, 1967-NMSC-225, 78 N.M. 434, 432 P.2d 399;Sloan v. Sloan, 1967-NMSC-080, 77 N.M. 632, 426 P.2d 780;Chrane v. Chrane, 1982-NMSC-089, 98 N.M. 471, 649 P.2d 1384.\n\nAward altered only if abuse of discretion shown.— It is within the sound discretion of the district court to determine whether to award alimony. An alimony award will be altered only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.Hertz v. Hertz, 1983-NMSC-004, 99 N.M. 320, 657 P.2d 1169.\n\nFactors to consider in awarding temporary or permanent alimony.— When a district court finds that a spouse is entitled to periodic spousal support for normal living expenses, but may become self-sufficient in the future, the court ordinarily should not order that periodic support terminate automatically at a future date when the recipient spouse may become self-sufficient. The proper course is to order such support for an indefinite time, with the payor spouse bearing the burden to move for reduction or termination of support when the recipient spouse has become more self-sufficient.Rabie v. Ogaki, 1993-NMCA-096, 116 N.M. 143, 860 P.2d 785.\n\nSeparation contract cutting off support contrary to public policy.— Provisions of a separation contract which would cut the plaintiff off without support from her former spouse in the case of spouse's remarriage though plaintiff remained single, or in the case of spouse's change of occupation, are void as contrary to public policy.Scanlon v. Scanlon, 1955-NMSC-035, 60 N.M. 43, 287 P.2d 238.\n\nMissouri decree entitled to full faith and credit.— A Missouri divorce decree which was a final and proper judgment of the Missouri court concerning alimony, child support and custody fully litigated and agreed to by all parties was entitled to full faith and credit under U.S. Const., art. IV, § 1.Corliss v. Corliss, 1976-NMSC-023, 89 N.M. 235, 549 P.2d 1070.\n\nAllowance of alimony as due process violation disfavored.— The contention that an allowance of alimony is in violation of the due process clause of the federal and state constitutions is looked upon with disfavor.Bardin v. Bardin, 1947-NMSC-003, 51 N.M. 2, 177 P.2d 167.\n\nAlimony is not intended as penalty against husband.Brister v. Brister, 1979-NMSC-038, 92 N.M. 711, 594 P.2d 1167.\n\nAlimony is intended to fulfill husband's obligation to provide supportneeded by the wife in accordance with the husband's ability to pay.Hurley v. Hurley, 1980-NMSC-067, 94 N.M. 641, 615 P.2d 256.\n\nIf alimony issue raised, parties entitled to present evidence.— Where plaintiff contended a need on her part for a continuation of her right to support and defendant denied this need, the issue of alimony was raised, and a proper disposition of this factual issue entitled plaintiff to introduce evidence and be fully heard in support of her contention. The trial court, by disposing of the issue on the basis of the colloquy between it and counsel, denied plaintiff her right.Burnside v. Burnside, 1973-NMSC-091, 85 N.M. 517, 514 P.2d 36.\n\nThis section does not authorize award of alimony subsequent to entry of final decree,when that decree did not initially award any alimony, unless the claimant is entitled to relief under Rule 1-059 or 1-060 NMRA.Gruber v. Gruber, 1974-NMSC-055, 86 N.M. 327, 523 P.2d 1353;Benavidez v. Benavidez, 1983-NMSC-032, 99 N.M. 535, 660 P.2d 1017.\n\nAlimony justified even though spouse receives property.— Alimony may be justified even though the wife eventually receives a large amount of property.Mitchell v. Mitchell, 1986-NMCA-028, 104 N.M. 205, 719 P.2d 432, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 84, 717 P.2d 60.\n\nIn a separation agreement provisions for alimony are severable from provisions as to property,and where the separation agreement was merged in the decree of divorce and became a part thereof, the provision for alimony is, by reason of the statute authorizing the court to modify provision for alimony at any time, subject to change.Scanlon v. Scanlon, 1955-NMSC-035, 60 N.M. 43, 287 P.2d 238.\n\nAward of wife's share of community property not alimony.— An award to a wife of her share of the community property, the payment of which the court properly secured with a lien on the husband's separate property, was not tantamount to an award of alimony.Ridgway v. Ridgway, 1980-NMSC-055, 94 N.M. 345, 610 P.2d 749.\n\nCourt may order community residence sold where spouse needs immediate, regular income.— Despite a husband's offer to give the wife his share in the community residence in lieu of alimony, the trial court's decision to award alimony and order the sale of the residence is proper where the wife demonstrates a need for immediate, regular income for her necessities.Psomas v. Psomas, 1982-NMSC-154, 99 N.M. 606, 661 P.2d 884,overruled in part byWalentowski v. Walentowski, 1983-NMSC-097, 100 N.M. 484, 672 P.2d 657.\n\nCourt may order husband to sign note for wife's residence.— Court may order ex-husband to cosign a note or enforce that order by appointing a special master to sign a note on the husband's behalf subsequent to entry of a marital settlement agreement between parties, in light of a previous order setting out the obligations of the husband regarding a new residence for his ex-wife and children.Wolcott v. Wolcott, 1984-NMCA-089, 101 N.M. 665, 687 P.2d 100.\n\nSettlement contracts which provide for payments in lieu of alimonyare subject to inquiry and modification by the trial court.Ferret v. Ferret, 1951-NMSC-076, 55 N.M. 565, 237 P.2d 594.\n\nDefenses available against payment of support.— In a proceeding for the enforcement of a support order, any valid defense against payment may be raised, including the defense of payment from some other source.Mask v. Mask, 1980-NMSC-134, 95 N.M. 229, 620 P.2d 883.\n\nPower to award alimony independent of being guilty.— This section constitutes a clear and unequivocal grant of power to district courts to award the wife, in divorce actions, reasonable alimony, in installments or lump sums, independent of which spouse may have been the guilty party. The power is limited only to the grant of a reasonable sum, as that factor is limited by the facts of the particular case.Redman v. Redman, 1958-NMSC-096, 64 N.M. 339, 328 P.2d 595.\n\nAlimony may be awarded independent of guilt.— District courts are empowered to award to the wife, in divorce actions, reasonable alimony, in installments or lump sum, independent of which spouse may have been the guilty party, and, on appeal in such case, the matter for review was whether the trial court abused its discretion in fixing the amount of the award under the circumstances of the case.Cassan v. Cassan, 1921-NMSC-060, 27 N.M. 256, 199 P. 1010.\n\nGranting alimony where not demanded.— A divorce decree granting the wife as alimony the difference between the value of the community property which she received and the value of the community property which the husband received was affirmed despite the fact that alimony was not demanded in the wife's petition as required by Rule 1-054(c) NMRA in judgment by default, since the essential nature of the decree was an equitable division of the community property of the parties for which the wife had petitioned.Worland v. Worland, 1976-NMSC-027, 89 N.M. 291, 551 P.2d 981.\n\nEven though not specifically requested, the court may, in an effort to equitably divide the community property, grant an award of alimony.Ridgway v. Ridgway, 1980-NMSC-055, 94 N.M. 345, 610 P.2d 749.\n\nSince divorce decree is silent on any award of alimony to wife,that judgment is res judicata on the question of alimony and precludes a later alimony award. Furthermore, a general reservation of jurisdiction in the decree is ineffective to uphold an award of alimony allowed after the entry of a final decree of divorce.Unser v. Unser, 1974-NMSC-063, 86 N.M. 648, 526 P.2d 790.\n\nLump sum in lieu of alimony.— It is within the power of the trial court to award and to set over to the wife a lump sum in lieu of alimony out of the husband's interest in the community.Harper v. Harper, 1950-NMSC-024, 54 N.M. 194, 217 P.2d 857.\n\nContinuing jurisdiction.— When Subsection F refers to court's continuing jurisdiction \"over proceedings involving periodic spousal support payments,\" it is referencing the support payment provisions in Subsection B(1)(a), (b), and (c) of this section.Edens v. Edens, 2005-NMCA-033, 137 N.M. 207, 109 P.3d 295, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-003, 137 N.M. 290, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nAlimony installments as absolute and vested.— Where a decree is rendered for alimony and is made payable in future installments the right to such installments becomes absolute and vested upon becoming due, and is therefore protected by the full faith and credit clause, unless by the law of the state in which a judgment for future alimony was rendered the right to demand and receive such future alimony is discretionary with the court which rendered the decree, to such an extent that no absolute or vested right attaches to receive installments ordered by the decree to be paid. This principle has also been applied to child support.Corliss v. Corliss, 1976-NMSC-023, 89 N.M. 235, 549 P.2d 1070).\n\nAccrued alimony.— Once a foreign court awards alimony and the installments become due, and where, under the law of that state, accrued, alimony cannot be cancelled; it therefore vests when due. The right to those accrued installments of alimony becomes a fixed property right. The judgment, insofar as the accrued alimony is concerned, becomes a nonmodifiable judgment and is enforceable and entitled to full faith and credit in all states under the U.S. Const., art. IV, § 1.Cain v. Cain, 1978-NMSC-014, 91 N.M. 423, 575 P.2d 607.\n\nCourt may disregard original alimony agreement and make own award.— Under Subsection B(2), the court may disregard a stipulated agreement for alimony incorporated in an original divorce decree and make an award that the court deems fair.Brister v. Brister, 1979-NMSC-038, 92 N.M. 711, 594 P.2d 1167.\n\nMental health of recipient.— The provision requiring the trial court to consider the health of a spouse seeking spousal support implicitly requires that the court also consider the mental health of a spouse where a prima facie showing has been made concerning the recipient spouse's alleged current mental condition.Martinez v. Martinez, 1997-NMCA-125, 124 N.M. 313, 950 P.2d 286.\n\nB. AMOUNT OF ALIMONY.\n\nNo fixed rule by which amount of permanent alimony can be determined,since each case must be decided upon its own relevant facts, in the light of what is fair and reasonable.Sloan v. Sloan, 1967-NMSC-080, 77 N.M. 632, 426 P.2d 780;Brister v. Brister, 1979-NMSC-038, 92 N.M. 711, 594 P.2d 1167.\n\nImportant factors to consider in determining permanent alimony.— There is no fixed rule by which the amount of permanent alimony can be determined, since each case must be decided upon its relevant facts in the light of what is fair and reasonable; however, some of the important factors to be considered in a determination of the amount of alimony to be awarded are the needs of the wife, her age, health and the means to support herself, the earning capacity and the future earnings of the husband, the duration of the marriage and the amount of property owned by the parties.Michelson v. Michelson, 1974-NMSC-022, 86 N.M. 107, 520 P.2d 263;Brister v. Brister, 1979-NMSC-038, 92 N.M. 711, 594 P.2d 1167;Hurley v. Hurley, 1980-NMSC-067, 94 N.M. 641, 615 P.2d 256;Ellsworth v. Ellsworth, 1981-NMSC-132, 97 N.M. 133, 637 P.2d 564.\n\nFactors to be considered by a district court in determining whether an alimony award is just and proper include the duration of the marriage, the wife's needs, her age, her health, the means she has available to support herself, the husband's earning capacity and the amount of property owned by each of the parties.Hertz v. Hertz, 1983-NMSC-004, 99 N.M. 320, 657 P.2d 1169;Rabie v. Ogaki, 1993-NMCA-096, 116 N.M. 143, 860 P.2d 785.\n\nCircumstances of both spouses considered.— The total circumstances of the supporting spouse as well as those of the recipient spouse must be considered in determining the amount of alimony, in order to avoid hardship on the supporting spouse and not to permit the recipient spouse to abdicate the responsibility for his or her own support and maintenance.Mitchell v. Mitchell, 1986-NMCA-028, 104 N.M. 205, 719 P.2d 432, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 84, 717 P.2d 60.\n\nFactors to be excluded in determining alimony.— A wife is not entitled to alimony in order to afford herself an opportunity to achieve an earning capacity reasonably comparable to that of her husband, nor in order to support herself in a style reasonably comparable to that enjoyed by the parties during the marriage. These are not factors upon which alimony is determined.Hertz v. Hertz, 1983-NMSC-004, 99 N.M. 320, 657 P.2d 1169.\n\nSubchapter-S corporation income.— Distributions from a Subchapter-S corporation that exceed the amount necessary to pay corporate business expenses or the shareholder-spouse's tax obligations are considered income for purposes of calculating family support obligations. All Subchapter-S corporation funds distributed to the shareholder-spouse must be attributed to the shareholder-spouse as income for spousal support purposes unless and until the shareholder-spouse can demonstrate what portion of the corporate distribution was used for business purposes or to offset the payment of income taxes resulting from any K-1 allocations.Clark v. Clark, 2014-NMCA-030, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nWhere respondent was the sole owner and operator of a Subchapter-S corporation; during the marriage of the parties, respondent received both a regular salary from the corporation as W-2 income and additional cash distributions as non-W-2 income; because the non-W-2 income distributed by the corporation did not match the K-1 allocations from the corporation that were reported on the parties's income tax returns, the district court found that it could not determine how much income respondent actually received from the non-W-2 income distributions, disregarded the non-W-2 income distributions in its calculation of respondent's income, and calculated respondent's income on the W-2 income alone, it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to exclude all of respondent's non-W-2 income for purposes of calculating family support obligations.Clark v. Clark, 2014-NMCA-030, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nDuration of spousal support.— Where petitioner did not work outside the home during the parties' marriage; respondent was the owner and operator of a Subchapter-S corporation, which was respondent's separate property; petitioner was 60 years of age and had no known prospects for any future earning capacity; the parties did not introduce any evidence of petitioner's earning capacity and did not anticipate petitioner's return to work as a viable reality; respondent was 66 years of age and due to respondent's age and health, respondent wanted to retire; and the district court awarded petitioner transitional support for an eighteen-month period without any evidence addressing petitioner's' future employability or potential income, the district court abused its discretion when it limited the duration of spousal support to eighteen months.Clark v. Clark, 2014-NMCA-030, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nNature of community assets awarded to be considered in alimony determination.— The trial court must look to the nature of the community assets given to each of the parties upon division in determining alimony.Ellsworth v. Ellsworth, 1981-NMSC-132, 97 N.M. 133, 637 P.2d 564.\n\nWhere the record does not reflect that the trial court considered the contrasting nature of the assets awarded to each party in evaluating the relative needs of the parties and reaching the amount of alimony to be awarded, the appellate court may remand to the trial court for further proceedings to reconsider the award of alimony.Ellsworth v. Ellsworth, 1981-NMSC-132, 97 N.M. 133, 637 P.2d 564.\n\nWife may testify on own medical condition.— In divorce and alimony action, trial court did not err in permitting wife to testify as to her present medical condition.Russell v. Russell, 1984-NMSC-010, 101 N.M. 648, 687 P.2d 83.\n\nProceeds from sale of property generally not considered.— While income (rental, interest, lease, etc.) produced by property may normally be considered in setting alimony, proceeds from selling the property itself should not be considered except in such rare cases where fairness requires.Ellsworth v. Ellsworth, 1981-NMSC-132, 97 N.M. 133, 637 P.2d 564.\n\nTrial court did not abuse its discretion in awardingwife $2,500 in alimony, payable in monthly installments of $125, when granting her a divorce, where husband owned $40,000 tourist court as separate property, and where record showed that whatever money was made from the tourist court operation was due in fact to the work of the wife, and at the time of trial she was making $30 per week as a waitress.Redman v. Redman, 1958-NMSC-096, 64 N.M. 339, 328 P.2d 595.\n\nAward not abuse of discretion.— An award of alimony of $4,000 in a lump sum out of an estate of $8,000, part of which is community property, and out of which sum appellee has to pay attorney fees, costs of the suit and support herself in ill health and destitute circumstances is not an abuse of discretion.Golden v. Golden, 1937-NMSC-021, 41 N.M. 356, 68 P.2d 928.\n\nAward not abuse of discretion.— An award of $75 per month for 12 months to a 31-year-old, able-bodied wife capable of working as she had done before and during her married life is not so little as to be an abuse of discretion by the trial court.Jones v. Jones, 1960-NMSC-106, 67 N.M. 415, 356 P.2d 231.\n\nC. MODIFICATION OF AWARD.\n\nAutomatic alimony increases.— It is not proper to include provisions in divorce decrees which provide for automatic alimony increases, whether they are expressed as escalator clauses, in terms of a percentage of a supporting spouse's income, or based upon a sliding-scale formula.Dunning v. Dunning, 1986-NMSC-036, 104 N.M. 295, 720 P.2d 1236.\n\nReopening support decrees.— The public policy of this state discourages repeated attempts to reopen support decrees. This policy places a burden upon the movant to show not just a substantial factual change, but also that, all things considered, the change justifies a new support order. Placing the burden of persuasion on the moving party implements public policy by making it more difficult to reopen the prior support order and easier to defend it.Cherpelis v. Cherpelis, 1996-NMCA-037, 121 N.M. 500, 914 P.2d 637, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 444, 913 P.2d 251.\n\nLump sum alimony,once awarded, cannot be modified.Michaluk v. Burke, 1987-NMCA-044, 105 N.M. 670, 735 P.2d 1176.\n\nThis section's provision permitting modification does not apply to lump sum awards under Subsection B(1)(d) of this section and Subsection B(1)(e) of this section.Edens v. Edens, 2005-NMCA-033, 137 N.M. 207, 109 P.3d 295, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-003, 137 N.M. 290, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nSingle sum payment.— Where the parties entered into a marital settlement agreement which provided that the husband would pay the wife monthly support in the amount of one-twelfth of $31,375 per year for the years 2005-2009, $39,000 per year for the years 2010-2014, and $23,000 per year for the years 2015-2019, and which provided that the support would end if the wife dies, the spousal support was a single sum and the district court did not have jurisdiction to modify it.Pruyn v. Lam, 2009-NMCA-103, 147 N.M. 39, 216 P.3d 804, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-008, 147 N.M. 395, 223 P.3d 940.\n\nEstate entitled to unpaid lump sum award.— Where a wife dies before actual receipt to a lump sum alimony award, her estate is entitled to collect it.Michaluk v. Burke, 1987-NMCA-044, 105 N.M. 670, 735 P.2d 1176.\n\nChanges in circumstances of divorced partiesmay warrant reducing or terminating alimony obligations.Brister v. Brister, 1979-NMSC-038, 92 N.M. 711, 594 P.2d 1167.\n\nEligibility for federal benefits not change of circumstances.— Absent findings that the husband was unable to continue to provide alimony, that the wife was no longer in financial need, or that she was capable of self support, the wife's eligibility for or receipt of federal Supplemental Security Income benefits did not amount to a change of circumstances justifying termination of alimony.Sheets v. Sheets, 1987-NMCA-128, 106 N.M. 451, 744 P.2d 924.\n\nContract for alimony incorporated in divorce decree becomes merged into decreeand the decree is subject to modification even when it contains a provision that the agreement cannot be amended without the consent of both parties.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958.\n\nAuthority to modify alimony award depends on law of jurisdictionwhich granted the award.Brister v. Brister, 1979-NMSC-038, 92 N.M. 711, 594 P.2d 1167.\n\nDue process necessary to modify alimony judgment.— Notice and a fair hearing must be afforded both parties to meet the requirements of due process, and therefore a court cannot modify a judgment when neither party has sought such relief and the issue has not been implicitly or explicitly consented to by the parties. Where the husband did not seek a modification of alimony, and neither party consented to a modification, the trial court's improper modification of future alimony was reversible error.Corliss v. Corliss, 1976-NMSC-023, 89 N.M. 235, 549 P.2d 1070.\n\nAlimony awards which provide for automatic increasesresult in alimony modifications without requiring evidence of changed circumstances and ignore the basic criteria of the recipient's need and the supporting spouse's ability to pay which must be established by the party seeking to demonstrate need.Dunning v. Dunning, 1986-NMSC-036, 104 N.M. 295, 720 P.2d 1236.\n\nPublic policy on modification of alimony awardsis established by Subsection B(2) which gives the district court the authority to change any order with respect to alimony allowed to either spouse \"whenever the circumstances render such change proper.\"Brister v. Brister, 1979-NMSC-038, 92 N.M. 711, 594 P.2d 1167.\n\nSubsection B(2) becomes part of any agreement for alimonyand the contract for alimony that is incorporated in a decree becomes merged and thus subject to equitable modification, even when it contains a provision that the agreement cannot be amended without the consent of both parties.Brister v. Brister, 1979-NMSC-038, 92 N.M. 711, 594 P.2d 1167.\n\nContinuing jurisdiction to modify and enforce.— A court having jurisdiction of a divorce proceeding has continuing jurisdiction to modify and enforce its decrees.Zarges v. Zarges, 1968-NMSC-151, 79 N.M. 494, 445 P.2d 97.\n\nEffect of expiration of obligation.— When the obligation to pay alimony expires, there is no longer any provision for alimony remaining. Under these circumstances, the court has no power to alter or amend alimony. Because however, the wife filed the motion before the alimony expired, the court had jurisdiction to modify the award.Deeds v. Deeds, 1993-NMCA-023, 115 N.M. 192, 848 P.2d 1119.\n\nSince district court reserved jurisdiction to modify alimony provision,it could modify it by increasing, diminishing, or abating it entirely.Mindlin v. Mindlin, 1937-NMSC-012, 41 N.M. 155, 66 P.2d 260;Lord v. Lord, 1932-NMSC-072, 37 N.M. 24, 16 P.2d 933,modified, 1933-NMSC-055, 37 N.M. 454, 24 P.2d 292.\n\nReservation of alimony.— So long as some alimony is reserved by the trial judge, the trial judge has continuing power to alter or amend the alimony award either upwards or downwards, as changing circumstances warrant.In re Danley, 14 Bankr. 493 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1981).\n\nNo authority to make retroactive modification of accrued and vested payments.— The authority to modify an alimony decree does not include the authority to make a retroactive modification of accrued and vested payments, unless the foreign state which entered the alimony decree had authority to do so or had done so prior to the maturity of the payments.Hazelwood v. Hazelwood, 1976-NMSC-074, 89 N.M. 659, 556 P.2d 345.\n\nGenerally a court cannot retroactively modify a support order that has accrued and become vested.Mask v. Mask, 1980-NMSC-134, 95 N.M. 229, 620 P.2d 883;Chrane v. Chrane, 1982-NMSC-089, 98 N.M. 471, 649 P.2d 1384.\n\nDe facto marriage not ground for retroactive modification of alimony.— A \"de facto marriage,\" whatever may be required to constitute such, does not constitute grounds for retroactively modifying or abating accrued alimony payments; however, the district court does have discretion to modify prospectively or terminate an alimony award, if the circumstances so warrant, and since the termination of alimony was largely predicated on its finding of a de facto marriage, the judgment of the trial court was reversed and the cause remanded.Hazelwood v. Hazelwood, 1976-NMSC-074, 89 N.M. 659, 556 P.2d 345.\n\nImproper basis for alimony reduction.— Voluntary assumption of excessive financial burdens is not a proper basis for alimony reduction.Russell v. Russell, 1984-NMSC-010, 101 N.M. 648, 687 P.2d 83.\n\nChange in wife's knowledge of husband's retirement plan not changed circumstances.— Where the only change of circumstances with respect to a provision for alimony in a divorce decree is a change in the knowledge of the wife as to the nature of the husband's retirement plan and neither the retirement plan nor the financial condition of the parties has changed at all, the strict test for changed circumstances is not met and the original order may not be modified.Parker v. Parker, 1979-NMSC-037, 92 N.M. 710, 594 P.2d 1166.\n\nAbility of alimony recipient to support self constitutes change.— If the recipient of alimony becomes able to support herself after the passage of a period of time, this constitutes a change in circumstances that has been held to warrant termination of the husband's alimony obligation.Brister v. Brister, 1979-NMSC-038, 92 N.M. 711, 594 P.2d 1167.\n\nBankruptcy discharge is changed circumstance.— Where payment by the debtor of debts later discharged in bankruptcy is a significant factor in the initial support award, a bankruptcy discharge is a changed circumstance permitting modification of the award.In re Danley, 14 Bankr. 493 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1981).\n\nEffect of bankruptcy proceedings on debts ordered to be paid in lieu of alimony.Dirks v. Dirks, 15 Bankr. 775 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1981).\n\nNo change in alimony payments absent support from recipient's paramour.— Where alimony recipient is not presently receiving any part of her support from a paramour and there is no showing that she will receive any support from him in the future because the couple has separated, no grounds exist for prospective reduction or cancellation of alimony payments.Brister v. Brister, 1979-NMSC-038, 92 N.M. 711, 594 P.2d 1167.\n\nIncrease in child support while reducing alimony payments.— Where husband asked for relief from alimony payments due to substantial change in circumstances, trial judge did not err in his unilateral decision to increase child support award in light of reduction in alimony award even though wife did not request modification of future child support payments.Altman v. Altman, 1984-NMCA-060, 101 N.M. 380, 683 P.2d 62.\n\nD. TERMINATION OF ALIMONY.\n\nRemarriage of spouse.— Spousal support designated as non-modifiable under 40-4-7 NMSA 1978 is not subject to the presumption of termination upon the remarriage of the receiving spouse.Galassi v. Galassi, 2009-NMCA-026, 145 N.M. 630, 203 P.3d 161.\n\nWhere the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a marital settlement agreement which was approved by the court in the final decree of dissolution of marriage; the agreement provided for the payment of spousal support by the plaintiff to the defendant; the agreement provided that the spousal support would be non-modifiable for five years; neither the agreement nor the final decree of dissolution of marriage mentioned the effect of the defendant's remarriage on the obligation to pay spousal support; the defendant remarried within the five year period; and there were no exceptional circumstances necessitating the continuation of spousal support, the obligation of the plaintiff to pay spousal support to the defendant did not terminate upon the remarriage of the defendant.Galassi v. Galassi, 2009-NMCA-026, 145 N.M. 630, 203 P.3d 161.\n\nCessation of alimony upon remarriage.— Where the provisions of the decree concerning alimony seem perfectly clear and unambiguous, providing, as they do, that \"in the event of her remarriage said payments shall cease,\" the cessation of alimony did not turn on the status of the remarriage as being valid, and when the event occurred the obligation to pay alimony ceased.Chavez v. Chavez, 1971-NMSC-062, 82 N.M. 624, 485 P.2d 735.\n\nIn New Mexico, men are not legally obliged to support the wives of others, and instances in which alimony should be continued after remarriage have been characterized as being \"extremely rare and exceptional.\"Chavez v. Chavez, 1971-NMSC-062, 82 N.M. 624, 485 P.2d 735.\n\nWhen the wife contracts a subsequent marriage with another, thus creating a duty of support in him, good public policy does not demand that she continue to receive support from her first husband unless she prove exceptional circumstances.Kuert v. Kuert, 1956-NMSC-002, 60 N.M. 432, 292 P.2d 115, superseded by statute,Galassi v. Galassi, 2009-NMCA-026, 145 N.M. 630, 203 P.3d 161.\n\nAlimony ends as of date of remarriage unless conditions extraordinary.— On the application of the divorced husband to abate support payment to the divorced wife on the ground of her remarriage, such application should be granted as of the date of her remarriage unless she proves extraordinary conditions justifying continuance of the former husband's duty to support his former wife after she has become the wife of another man, and the evaluation and effect to be given these conditions rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.Kuert v. Kuert, 1956-NMSC-002, 60 N.M. 432, 292 P.2d 115, superseded by statute,Galassi v. Galassi, 2009-NMCA-026, 145 N.M. 630, 203 P.3d 161.\n\nProof of remarriage establishes prima facie case for modification.— Proof of his former wife's remarriage establishes the divorced husband's prima facie case for modification of alimony payments coming due subsequent to such remarriage.Kuert v. Kuert, 1956-NMSC-002, 60 N.M. 432, 292 P.2d 115, superseded by statute,Galassi v. Galassi, 2009-NMCA-026, 145 N.M. 630, 203 P.3d 161.\n\nSince divorced wife admitted her remarriageand no proof of such exceptional circumstances as would justify a continuance of the husband's duty to support his ex-wife subsequent to her remarriage, it appeared trial court erred in awarding wife alimony accruing subsequent to her remarriage.Kuert v. Kuert, 1956-NMSC-002, 60 N.M. 432, 292 P.2d 115, superseded by statute,Galassi v. Galassi, 2009-NMCA-026, 145 N.M. 630, 203 P.3d 161.\n\nSome court action is necessary to abate alimony if wife marries.Mindlin v. Mindlin, 1937-NMSC-012, 41 N.M. 155, 66 P.2d 260.\n\nWife's impending remarriage considered in fixing alimony.— In fixing the amount of alimony, some consideration should be given to the impending remarriage of the wife, bearing in mind that alimony is intended as a method of fulfilling the husband's obligation to provide the support needed by the wife in accordance with the husband's ability to pay.Michelson v. Michelson, 1976-NMSC-026, 89 N.M. 282, 551 P.2d 638.\n\nRemarriage of husband does not warrant abrogation of alimony.— Remarriage of husband, unaccompanied by showing of inability to support present wife suitably, does not warrant abrogation of alimony.Lord v. Lord, 1932-NMSC-072, 37 N.M. 24, 16 P.2d 933, modified, 1933-NMSC-055, 37 N.M. 454, 24 P.2d 292.\n\nAlimony not revived following annulment of remarriage.— Under the facts of this case alimony was not revived following annulment of wife's remarriage as the first husband is entitled to rely on the wife's remarriage and reorder his personal and financial affairs accordingly.Chavez v. Chavez, 1971-NMSC-062, 82 N.M. 624, 485 P.2d 735.\n\nLive-in relationship.— Although a live-in relationship is not, by itself, grounds for terminating alimony, even where parties hold themselves out as husband and wife, the economic factors of the relationship must be examined to determine whether they alter the need of the recipient spouse.Cherpelis v. Cherpelis, 1996-NMCA-037, 121 N.M. 500, 914 P.2d 637, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 444, 913 P.2d 251.\n\nPower to abate alimony payments retroactively from date of remarriage.— Changed circumstances may justify a prospective modification, or even termination, of a prior award of alimony made by a foreign state where the courts of that state have authority to make such changes in the award, and the New Mexico courts have the power to abate retroactively accrued alimony payments from the date of the remarriage of the former spouse to whom alimony has previously been awarded in this situation as well as in the case of a New Mexico award.Hazelwood v. Hazelwood, 1976-NMSC-074, 89 N.M. 659, 556 P.2d 345.\n\nV. GRANTING AND MODIFYING CHILD CUSTODY AND SUPPORT.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nGranting and modifying child custody and support.— The Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §1901 does not apply to give a tribal court exclusive jurisdiction over custody disputes in divorce proceedings.Cherino v. Cherino, 2008-NMCA-024, 143 N.M. 452, 176 P.3d 1184.\n\nTrial court exclusive jurisdiction.— Trial courts are given exclusive jurisdiction of all matters relating to the guardianship, care, custody, maintenance, and education of the children.Rhinehart v. Nowlin, 1990-NMCA-136, 111 N.M. 319, 805 P.2d 88.\n\nDistrict court has jurisdiction to modify and changeexisting orders regarding visitation rights and support obligations.Barela v. Barela, 1978-NMSC-047, 91 N.M. 686, 579 P.2d 1253.\n\nRestrictions religious practices.— In determining whether a parent should be restricted from practicing or encouraging a child in a religious belief or practice, the trial court must consider whether there exists detailed factual evidence demonstrating that the conflicting beliefs or practices of the parents pose substantial physical or emotional harm to the child, whether restricting the religious interaction between a parent and the child will necessarily alleviate the harm, and whether such restrictions are narrowly tailored so as to minimize interference with the parent's religious freedom.Khalsa v. Khalsa, 1988-NMCA-013, 107 N.M. 31, 751 P.2d 715, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 16, 751 P.2d 700.\n\nAgreements between parents and third partiesregarding the guardianship, care, custody, maintenance or education of children are subject to judicial modification. Implicit in every such agreement is the right of the parties and the court to amend or abrogate such agreements when circumstances necessitate and the best interests and welfare of the child so require.In re Doe, 1982-NMCA-094, 98 N.M. 340, 648 P.2d 798, cert. deniedsub nom. Cook v. Brownfield, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794.\n\nDomicile of minor is same as domicile of parentwith whom he lives, and the ultimate facts necessary to sustain a conclusion of domicile are physical presence in the state at some time in the past and concurrent intention to make the state one's home. The lower court found physical presence in the state, but it failed to find that the requisite intent existed, and accordingly jurisdiction based on domicile of the child was lacking.Worland v. Worland, 1976-NMSC-027, 89 N.M. 291, 551 P.2d 981.\n\nCustody orders remain effective though court without jurisdiction to grant divorce.— Although the parties are not divorced due to the trial court's lack of jurisdiction as required in 40-4-5 NMSA 1978, it does not follow that the provisions pertaining to custody, child support and visitation are void. Where the trial court had jurisdiction over these issues, and no issue on the appeal involved the court's orders concerning the children, the orders of the court pertaining to custody, support and maintenance and visitation remain in effect and are binding on the parties unless modified by further order of the trial court.Heckathorn v. Heckathorn, 1967-NMSC-017, 77 N.M. 369, 423 P.2d 410.\n\nJudicial immunity from personal liability where court had jurisdiction to order commitment.— The court has wide discretion in respect to the guardianship, care and custody of minor children whose parents are parties to a divorce action in which custody of the children is involved. Here the parents were the natural guardians, were parties to the divorce action, and custody of the children was involved. The parents were before the court, and at one juncture in the proceedings a child was personally present in court. It may be that the order committing the child to the state hospital was improvident and erroneous, but it was entered in a cause over which the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter and the parties, and therefore, the rule of judicial immunity from personal liability in damages arising out of the entry of such order applies.Ryan v. Scoggin, 245 F.2d 54 (10th Cir. 1957).\n\nNo abuse of discretion if law and procedure followed.— Where trial court temporarily reduced support payments and made custodial changes and in doing so followed both the applicable principles of law and regular procedure in making its findings of fact, and where its findings were supported by substantial evidence, the results were pursuant to judicial discretion; not in its abuse.Fox v. Doak, 1968-NMSC-031, 78 N.M. 743, 438 P.2d 153.\n\nCourt required to give full force and effect to Missouri decree.— Where the trial court found that $3,900 was owed in delinquent alimony based on the $150 per month provided by the parties' Missouri decree, but ordered the husband to pay $100 per month up to $1,500 and deferred payment on the remaining $2,400, and made no finding on child support arrearages, which totalled $8297.65 through June, 1974, its actions constituted reversible error; since New Mexico gives the Missouri divorce decree full faith and credit, the trial court was obliged to give full force and effect to the accrued alimony and child support at the time of the district court hearing. The Missouri court granting the divorce had no power to modify accrued alimony and child support, and therefore, the district court in New Mexico had no such power either, and should have awarded a judgment in favor of the wife for $3,900 in delinquent alimony and made a finding on delinquent child support.Corliss v. Corliss, 1976-NMSC-023, 89 N.M. 235, 549 P.2d 1070.\n\nCourt has discretion where counterclaim in form of contempt action.— In a suit for a money judgment very little discretion is allowed, the court merely examining the validity of the prior judgment and entering a money judgment, but since the wife counterclaimed against the husband in his change of custody action in the form of a contempt action, as opposed to seeking a money judgment for arrearages, her action invoked the equitable powers of the court in which the trial court has discretion.Corliss v. Corliss, 1976-NMSC-023, 89 N.M. 235, 549 P.2d 1070.\n\nConsideration of support related to change of custody.— The husband's action for a change of custody implicitly involved the consideration of future child support if a change of custody were made, and although it would have been better practice to plead for modification of child support when seeking a change of custody, failure to do so did not preclude consideration of the issue on due process grounds since the questions of change of custody and child support are so inextricably related.Corliss v. Corliss, 1976-NMSC-023, 89 N.M. 235, 549 P.2d 1070.\n\nB. CUSTODY.\n\nContinuing jurisdiction.— As long as a court continues to have jurisdiction over either the children or both parents, it has continuing jurisdiction to hear all matters relating to custody.Murphy v. Murphy, 1981-NMSC-069, 96 N.M. 401, 631 P.2d 307.\n\nAbuse of discretion required before reversal of child custody.— Although placing restraints upon a person's free movements is a questionable practice generally, nevertheless where a court in its discretion and in the best interests of the children concludes that they should be reared where guidance can be had from the father while living with the mother, the court cannot reverse unless the conclusion is a manifest abuse of discretion under the evidence in the case.Jones v. Jones, 1960-NMSC-106, 67 N.M. 415, 356 P.2d 231.\n\nTrial court cannot be reversed.— The trial court is vested with great discretion in awarding the custody of young children and the court cannot reverse unless the court's conclusion about the best interests of the children is a manifest abuse of discretion under the evidence in the case.Kotrola v. Kotrola, 1968-NMSC-104, 79 N.M. 258, 442 P.2d 570.\n\nJudgment of sister state awarding custody is entitled to full faith and crediton the state of facts then existing, but if subsequent thereto a substantial change of conditions has occurred calculated to affect the child's welfare, the court may in a later hearing render such decree as the child's welfare requires. The discretion of the trial court in child custody matters is wide.Terry v. Terry, 1970-NMSC-135, 82 N.M. 113, 476 P.2d 772;Murphy v. Murphy, 1981-NMSC-069, 96 N.M. 401, 631 P.2d 307.\n\nIn personam jurisdiction over parents sufficient to determine custody.— Where the district court had in personam jurisdiction over both parents in divorce action, it had jurisdiction to determine child custody.Wallace v. Wallace, 1958-NMSC-014, 63 N.M. 414, 320 P.2d 1020.\n\nAlternative bases and concurrent jurisdiction.— Not only may there be alternative bases of jurisdiction over custody in a single state, but several states may have concurrent jurisdiction.Wallace v. Wallace, 1958-NMSC-014, 63 N.M. 414, 320 P.2d 1020.\n\nCourt's jurisdiction not expanded from one type proceeding to another.— Under this section the power of the court to make a final order of custody is predicated on the existence of a proceeding for the disposition of children; the section does not expand the court's jurisdiction established for one type of proceeding to the other types enumerated therein, nor does it address the initial subject matter jurisdiction of the court to hear the types of proceedings enumerated, but only determines the power of the court once jurisdiction is established.Worland v. Worland, 1976-NMSC-027, 89 N.M. 291, 551 P.2d 981.\n\nTrial court has wide discretion in matter of awarding custodyof children in divorce actions; and the welfare of the child is the primary consideration in making the award.Urzua v. Urzua, 1960-NMSC-094, 67 N.M. 304, 355 P.2d 123.\n\nDetermination of custody by trial judge entitled to great weight.— The determination of custody by the trial judge who saw the parties, observed their demeanor and heard the testimony, is entitled to great weight.Kotrola v. Kotrola, 1968-NMSC-104, 79 N.M. 258, 442 P.2d 570.\n\nNo violation of due process where both parties given opportunity to be heard.— There was no violation of due process at a change of custody hearing where the trial court first heard the husband's evidence regarding custody, including the testimony of the wife as a hostile witness, the wife's attorney extensively cross-examined the husband, and although the wife's attorney had waived his right to cross-examine the wife when she was called as a hostile witness by the husband, her testimony as to custody surfaced in her counterclaim for contempt; a full and fair opportunity to be heard was afforded both parties in this case.Corliss v. Corliss, 1976-NMSC-023, 89 N.M. 235, 549 P.2d 1070.\n\nIn custody cases, two distinct elements are always present:(1) the child-state relationship, sometimes referred to as status and (2) the respective claims of the parents to the child's custody.Wallace v. Wallace, 1958-NMSC-014, 63 N.M. 414, 320 P.2d 1020.\n\nCourt may make independent investigation in child custody hearing.— Where the court is not satisfied with the evidence presented with reference to custody of minor children, he may make independent investigation, but any witnesses called should appear at a hearing before the court or before a master appointed by him for the purpose.Martinez v. Martinez, 1946-NMSC-003, 49 N.M. 405, 165 P.2d 125.\n\nControlling influence welfare and best interests of child.— The trial court had a wide discretion in determining whether a custodial decree should be modified. In making that determination, the controlling influence should be the welfare and best interests of the child.Fox v. Doak, 1968-NMSC-031, 78 N.M. 743, 438 P.2d 153.\n\nThe best interests of the child is the principal consideration in determining custody, as well as in procedures seeking change in custody orders.Stone v. Stone, 1968-NMSC-116, 79 N.M. 351, 443 P.2d 741.\n\nThe best interest of the children is of paramount consideration in determining the custody of minor children, and the same considerations form the basis for modifying a custodial decree.Kotrola v. Kotrola, 1968-NMSC-104, 79 N.M. 258, 442 P.2d 570.\n\nThe principal guide to a decision under this section to modify a divorce decree is the welfare and best interests of the children.Tuttle v. Tuttle, 1959-NMSC-063, 66 N.M. 134, 343 P.2d 838.\n\nControlling inquiry of the trial court in settling any custody dispute is the best interests of the child.Schuermann v. Schuermann, 1980-NMSC-027, 94 N.M. 81, 607 P.2d 619.\n\nIn removing restraining order against visitation.— Where at a contempt hearing the trial court found and concluded that restraining order against the appellee from visiting the stepson should be dissolved, the court exercised proper discretion in refusing to hold appellee in contempt, and in removing the previous restraining order. The paramount consideration was the welfare of the minor.Nesbit v. Nesbit, 1969-NMSC-064, 80 N.M. 294, 454 P.2d 776.\n\nBest interests not measured altogether by material and economic factors.— When considering the right to custody, the welfare and best interest of the child is not measured altogether by material and economic factors - parental love and affection must find some place in the scheme and we all know this covers a multitude of weaknesses.Shorty v. Scott, 1975-NMSC-030, 87 N.M. 490, 535 P.2d 1341.\n\nRacial consideration alone not proper determination of best interests.— In suit to change custody of minor children, racial considerations alone cannot properly determine what is in the best interests of children, or what is most consonant with their welfare or physical and mental well being, and where lower courts found that divorced wife had shown instability in her attitude toward the moral training of her children by the way she has lived with a black man, and that the children would be better reared with members of their own race, such finding was an abuse of that court's discretion.Boone v. Boone, 1977-NMSC-042, 90 N.M. 466, 565 P.2d 337.\n\nParents have natural and legal right to custody of their children.— This right, a prima facie and not an absolute right, creates a presumption that the welfare and best interests of the minor child will best be served in the custody of the natural parents and casts the burden of proving the contrary on the nonparent.Shorty v. Scott, 1975-NMSC-030, 87 N.M. 490, 535 P.2d 1341.\n\nParental right doctrine given prominent consideration.— In a custody dispute where the opposing parties are the natural parents, or one of them, versus grandparents or other persons having no permanent or legal right to custody of the minor child, \"parental right\" doctrine which holds that a parent who is able to care for his children and desires to do so, and who has not been found to be an unfit person to have their custody in an action or proceeding where that question is in issue, is entitled to custody as against grandparents or others who have no permanent or legal right to custody, is to be given prominent, though not controlling, consideration.Shorty v. Scott, 1975-NMSC-030, 87 N.M. 490, 535 P.2d 1341.\n\nBoth parents on equal footing.— In a custody case in which the parents are opposed or in a case between parents for modification of a custody decree, the welfare and best interests of the minor child is the paramount consideration. A consideration of parental rights is unnecessary because both parties are on equal footing in the eyes of the law, and though a specific finding of unfitness on the part of the parent to be denied custody is not necessary in all such cases, parental unfitness would be consideration in determining the welfare and best interest of the minor child.Shorty v. Scott, 1975-NMSC-030, 87 N.M. 490, 535 P.2d 1341.\n\nExpress findings supported by substantial evidence necessary where natural parent denied custody.— As against a third person, a natural parent would be entitled as a matter of law to custody of the minor child unless there has been established on the parent's part neglect, abandonment, incapacity, moral delinquency, instability of character or inability to furnish the child with needed care, or unless it has been established that such custody otherwise would not be in the best welfare and interest of the child, and the trial court must make express findings supported by substantial evidence if the natural parent is to be denied custody, not only that the parent is unfit, but that the third person seeking to obtain or retain custody is fit and the welfare and best interests of the child would best be served by giving custody to that third person. In a custody dispute between a natural mother and the children's grandmother where there were no express findings concerning the fitness of the parties and the evidence adduced at trial was meager, the case was reversed and remanded for a new proceeding to be held consistently with the proper presumption and burden of proof.Shorty v. Scott, 1975-NMSC-030, 87 N.M. 490, 535 P.2d 1341.\n\nExpressed wish of minor as to custody as considered factor.— The prevailing and correct rule concerning the proper weight to be given to the expressed wish of a minor whose custody is at issue is that in cases of children of sufficient age, discretion and intelligence to exercise an enlightened judgment, their wishes concerning their own custody are a factor which should be considered by the court in arriving at its conclusion on the issue, but is in no sense controlling.Stone v. Stone,1968-NMSC-116, 79 N.M. 351, 443 P.2d 741.\n\nProof of desire, fitness and ability of guardian.— There must be proof of the desire, fitness and ability of the persons in whom custody is placed and there shall be opportunity to bring before the court matters in rebuttal of such proof, if any there be.Bell v. Odil, 1956-NMSC-005, 60 N.M. 404, 292 P.2d 96.\n\nChild custody award not to be based on confidential report.— A trial court may not award custody of minor children in a divorce suit on the basis of confidential report of a public welfare office employee which is based on unsworn testimony and the contents of which are not evidence in the case and have not been disclosed to the parties.Martinez v. Martinez, 1946-NMSC-003, 49 N.M. 405, 165 P.2d 125.\n\nErroneous awarding of custody based on confidential report waived.— Even though it was error for court to determine issue of awarding custody of minor on the basis of a confidential report from a welfare employee which did not constitute evidence in the case, where the party did not call the court's attention to the error, such party could not make an issue of it for the first time on appeal.Martinez v. Martinez, 1946-NMSC-003, 49 N.M. 405, 165 P.2d 125.\n\nCustody of minor child should not be granted to nonresidentunless it is shown that the welfare of the child will be greatly benefited.Urzua v. Urzua, 1960-NMSC-094, 67 N.M. 304, 355 P.2d 123.\n\nCourt authority to grant visitation rights.— The granting of visitation rights to a person or persons who the trial court determines are significant and important to the welfare of the children is a part of the trial court's grant of power.Rhinehart v. Nowlin, 1990-NMCA-136, 111 N.M. 319, 805 P.2d 88.\n\nTrial court has the power and discretion to grant visitation rights to a stepmother, where visitation is in the best interests and welfare of the children.Rhinehart v. Nowlin, 1990-NMCA-136, 111 N.M. 319, 805 P.2d 88.\n\nEffect of custodial order on right to travel or relocate.— An order continuing child custody with the mother, contingent upon her returning to New Mexico from California with the child and complying with visitation rights granted to the father, did not unlawfully infringe on the mother's right to travel or to relocate.Alfieri v. Alfieri, 1987-NMCA-003, 105 N.M. 373, 733 P.2d 4.\n\nAs a general rule, the noncustodial parent's right to visitation should not prevent the custodial parent from moving when the reasons for the move are legitimate and the best interest of the children will be served by accompanying the custodial parent.Newhouse v. Chavez, 1988-NMCA-110, 108 N.M. 319, 772 P.2d 353, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 197, 769 P.2d 731 (1989).\n\nMother could not be deprived of her right, as sole custodian, to move herself and her children, where there was no evidence of bad faith in the mother's conduct in relocating to another city, and the trial court made no findings addressing the interest of the children in their relationship with mother, their younger sibling or their stepfather, or as to the independent relationships within the family.Newhouse v. Chavez, 1988-NMCA-110, 108 N.M. 319, 772 P.2d 353, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 197, 769 P.2d 731 (1989).\n\nOrder alternating custody annually within court's discretion.— An order which placed custody of girl of nine years with the father for one year, then with the mother for one year, alternating annually, was within the wide discretion of the court.Edington v. Edington, 1947-NMSC-002, 50 N.M. 349, 176 P.2d 915.\n\nEvidence of child's school attendance found substantial.— Evidence, which showed that the child had not been able to function properly while in school in California due to various emotional problems precipitated from the environment in which he had been living and that these problems were alleviated to a great extent when the boy was with the appellee and had begun attending school in Albuquerque on a regular basis, with special assistance, found to be substantial.Cole v. Adler, 1971-NMSC-053, 82 N.M. 599, 485 P.2d 355.\n\nC. MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY.\n\nTrust for maintenance and support authorized.— This section and 40-4-14 NMSA 1978 authorize the setting apart of a portion of each spouse's property and the creation of a custodial trust for the maintenance and support of minor children in a divorce and support proceeding.Blake v. Blake, 1985-NMCA-009, 102 N.M. 354, 695 P.2d 838.\n\nNo abuse of discretion if finding supported by substantial evidence.— The rule applicable in cases seeking a change of custody is to the effect that the trial court has discretion in its determination of custody and that appellate court will not interfere or reverse unless there is not substantial evidence to support the court's findings and conclusions, or there has been a manifest abuse of discretion.Stone v. Stone, 1968-NMSC-116, 79 N.M. 351, 443 P.2d 741.\n\nModification of joint custody by awarding primary physical custody to father.— Where father filed for a change of custody of his two children, requesting that he be awarded sole legal custody and that he be permitted to relocate to another state with his children, the district court's order, awarding primary physical custody to father and permitting father to relocate children to another state, intended only to modify, not terminate, joint custody, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in modifying joint custody because it considered all of the factors necessary in determining whether relocation was in the best interests of the children.Hopkins v. Wollaber, 2019-NMCA-024.\n\nCourt's power and authority to modify custody award.— Where in a child custody case a court finds a change of circumstances and conditions, the court's hands are not tied and it has power and authority to modify its previous custody award as it deemed best for the child.Terry v. Terry, 1970-NMSC-135, 82 N.M. 113, 476 P.2d 772.\n\nTrial courts are vested with wide discretion indetermining whether a custodial decree should be modified.Cole v. Adler, 1971-NMSC-053, 82 N.M. 599, 485 P.2d 355.\n\nCourt not to modify order without hearing.— The provision of this section that the court \"may modify and change any order in respect to the guardianship, care, custody, maintenance or education of said children, whenever circumstances render such change proper\" does not mean that the court can act without a hearing, after notice to all necessary parties, and after giving them an opportunity to present evidence in connection therewith.Tuttle v. Tuttle, 1959-NMSC-063, 66 N.M. 134, 343 P.2d 838.\n\nUsual and ordinary procedures to be adhered to.— Before any parent or other person having legal custody is deprived of the same, or any change made therein, the usual and ordinary procedures must be adhered to.Tuttle v. Tuttle, 1959-NMSC-063, 66 N.M. 134, 343 P.2d 838.\n\nBefore any parent or other person having legal custody is deprived of the same, or any change made therein, the usual and ordinary procedures requiring pleadings and notice must be adhered to.Padgett v. Padgett, 1960-NMSC-123, 68 N.M. 1, 357 P.2d 335.\n\nPleadings and procedure upon modification of custody awardare, and because of their nature should be, far more elastic than is the case with usual adversary proceedings. The discretion of the court in these matters is far-reaching.Terry v. Terry, 1970-NMSC-135, 82 N.M. 113, 476 P.2d 772;Bell v. Odil, 1956-NMSC-005, 60 N.M. 404, 292 P.2d 96.\n\nCustody may be reopened upon showing of mistake.— A divorce case may be reopened at any time when a party to the case files an application showing that the court made a mistake in its award of custody of a minor child.Martinez v. Martinez, 1946-NMSC-003, 49 N.M. 405, 165 P.2d 125.\n\nMust show change of circumstances for change of custody.— Change of custody is impermissible except upon showing of change of circumstances.Stone v. Stone, 1968-NMSC-116, 79 N.M. 351, 443 P.2d 741.\n\nThe child's best interests is the principal consideration of the court in initially determining a child's custody, as well as in effecting a change in custody, and a change of custody is permissible only upon a showing of a change of circumstances, even if decree provided otherwise.Specter v. Specter, 1973-NMSC-047, 85 N.M. 112, 509 P.2d 879.\n\nEvery presumption in favor of reasonableness of original decree.— When modification of divorce decree is sought with respect to provisions for custody of a minor child, the moving party is visited with the burden of showing that circumstances have so changed as to merit the change, every presumption being, however, in favor of the reasonableness of the original decree.Edington v. Edington, 1947-NMSC-002, 50 N.M. 349, 176 P.2d 915.\n\nCustody not changed where conditions essentially same.— Where the evidence discloses that other than the fact of the remarriage of the mother, the stability of the mother's situation, and an improved change in the nature of the residences of both parents, essentially the same conditions existed at the time of the modification hearing as existed at the time of the divorce there were insufficient grounds to support the change of the child custody arrangement.Seeley v. Jaramillo, 1986-NMCA-100, 104 N.M. 783, 727 P.2d 91.\n\nThough there is no statutory requirement that a change of circumstances must be shownbefore a custody decree will be modified or changed, it is well settled in this jurisdiction that a showing of changed circumstances is a prerequisite to modification or change of custody. The change of circumstance must be shown to be of a material nature before a modification or change is justified, and the burden of showing a material change of circumstances rests upon the moving party.Davis v. Davis, 1972-NMSC-045, 83 N.M. 787, 498 P.2d 674.\n\nChange in visitation rights.— The language of the court in reviewing an order modifying alimony payments and determining that no change in circumstances had been shown is equally applicable where visitation rights are involved and where plaintiff makes no claim of changed circumstances, the trial court's order should not be disturbed.Kerley v. Kerley, 1961-NMSC-159, 69 N.M. 291, 366 P.2d 141.\n\nChange of circumstances necessary where foreign decree presumed reasonable.— In a change of custody action between two parties whose original divorce and custody decree was entered in a foreign state, the moving party must show a change of circumstances in light of the presumption of reasonableness of the foreign divorce decree; where the change of custody was based upon substantial evidence it did not constitute an abuse of discretion by the trial court.Corliss v. Corliss, 1976-NMSC-023, 89 N.M. 235, 549 P.2d 1070.\n\nModification reversed.— Judgment changing sole custody in the mother to joint legal custody, unless and until the mother was able to comply with a parenting plan agreed to by the parties, was reversed, where the trial court's findings failed to resolve basic issues material and necessary to a determination that modification of the initial custody agreement to joint custody was in the best interests of the children.Newhouse v. Chavez, 1988-NMCA-110, 108 N.M. 319, 772 P.2d 353, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 197, 769 P.2d 731 (1989).\n\nAwarding of child support rests within sound discretion of court.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958.\n\nSupport obligations are for benefit of children,and the court should not punish the children for the wrongdoing of the mother.Barela v. Barela, 1978-NMSC-047, 91 N.M. 686, 579 P.2d 1253.\n\nSupport obligations are for the benefit of the children, and if the custodial parent does not have the financial ability to support the children, the support obligation should not be reduced.Barela v. Barela, 1978-NMSC-047, 91 N.M. 686, 579 P.2d 1253.\n\nUndivided support award directed at more than one childis presumed to continue in force for the full amount until the youngest child reaches majority.Britton v. Britton, 1983-NMSC-084, 100 N.M. 424, 671 P.2d 1135.\n\nAccrued and unpaid periodic child support installmentsmandated in a divorce decree are each considered final judgments on the date they become due.Britton v. Britton, 1983-NMSC-084, 100 N.M. 424, 671 P.2d 1135.\n\nStatute of limitations.— Because each monthly child support installment mandated in the final decree is a final judgment, the statute of limitations period found in 37-1-2 NMSA 1978 applies.Britton v. Britton, 1983-NMSC-084, 100 N.M. 424, 671 P.2d 1135.\n\nD. CHILD SUPPORT.\n\nCourt unauthorized to withhold support until visitation allowed.— The trial court acted beyond its statutory authority in establishing the payment of child support into a trust which provided for the parties' children's post-minority education, until the mother allowed reasonable visitation rights.Dillard v. Dillard, 1986-NMCA-088, 104 N.M. 763, 727 P.2d 71.\n\nJudicial district's child support guidelinesare taken into consideration by the trial court with the other circumstances of a case when awarding child support; these guidelines are not mandatory amounts that the trial court must use in setting child support payments.Chavez v. Chavez, 1982-NMSC-104, 98 N.M. 678, 652 P.2d 228.\n\nPresent ability to pay essential in contempt sentence.— Present ability to pay arrears of monthly sums allowed for support of children is essential to validity of a contempt sentence to continue until payment, and, where record shows that such sentence was imposed in absence of ability to pay, the sentence will not be sustained on habeas corpus.Ex parte Sedillo, 1929-NMSC-038, 34 N.M. 98, 278 P. 202.\n\nChildren not to be denied trust benefits as punishment of delinquent mother.— Where the court has set aside a portion of the common property of divorced parents for the support of their children and placed it in the hands of a trustee, the children should not be deprived of the benefits of such provision by way of punishment of the delinquent mother.Fullen v. Fullen, 1915-NMSC-091, 21 N.M. 212, 153 P. 294, superseded by statuteFairchild v. United Serv. Corp., 1948-NMSC-048, 52 N.M. 289, 197 P.2d 875.\n\nParent not entitled to carry-back credit against delinquent support payments.— While a parent is entitled to credit against support payments falling due after social security payments to his child, which resulted from his contribution to the social security fund and his retirement, he is not entitled to a carry-back credit against support payments that were delinquent when the social security payments began.Mask v. Mask, 1980-NMSC-134, 95 N.M. 229, 620 P.2d 883.\n\nBoth parents on equal footing.— Although a trial court should consider the various circumstances that bear on both parents' ability to provide needed support, both parents still have the duty to support their minor children.Henderson v. Lekvold, 1980-NMSC-133, 95 N.M. 288, 621 P.2d 505.\n\nConsideration, for support, of disability benefits.— Trial court was not precluded from considering the husband's disability benefits as part of his financial resources in determining a reasonable amount of child support, where the parties had previously agreed not to consider the disability benefits and the court made this agreement explicit in a subsequent order.Hopkins v. Guin, 1986-NMCA-097, 105 N.M. 459, 734 P.2d 237, cert. quashed, 105 N.M. 395, 733 P.2d 364 (1987).\n\nFather in contempt not released on habeas corpus where separation regarded permanent.— A father adjudged in contempt for failure to pay monthly sums decreed for support of children will not be discharged on habeas corpus on the ground that court had no jurisdiction to render the decree, where it appears that both parties and the court regarded the separation as permanent, although not expressly alleged in the complaint.Ex parte Sedillo, 1929-NMSC-038, 34 N.M. 98, 278 P. 202.\n\nChild support enforceable by attachment.— Court may enforce by attachment as for contempt its decree for monthly payments for support of children.Ex parte Sedillo, 1929-NMSC-038, 34 N.M. 98, 278 P. 202.\n\nScope of review on appeal of child support awardis limited to examining the record only to determine if the trial court abused its discretion by fixing an amount contrary to all reason.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958.\n\nE. MODIFICATION OF CHILD SUPPORT.\n\nConstrued with 40-4-11.1 NMSA 1978.— The legislature intended 40-4-11.1 NMSA 1978 to update and make uniform throughout the state the amount of the child support obligation based on the income of the parents, but did not intend to abolish the requirement that the party seeking modification make the traditional showing of a substantial change in circumstances, harmonizing 40-4-11.1 NMSA 1978 with 40-4-7 NMSA 1978 and giving effect to both.Perkins v. Rowson, 1990-NMCA-089, 110 N.M. 671, 798 P.2d 1057, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 641, 798 P.2d 591.\n\nApplicable date for modification of child support payments is date of filing of petition or pleadingrather than the date of hearing, unless there is an unreasonable delay in bringing the case to trial by a party or unless there are unusual circumstances.Montoya v. Montoya, 1980-NMSC-122, 95 N.M. 189, 619 P.2d 1233.\n\nModification of child support payments discretionary.— Whether to modify an award of support payments is in the discretion of the trial judge.Barela v. Barela, 1978-NMSC-047, 91 N.M. 686, 579 P.2d 1253.\n\nLocal district court guidelines should be consulted in determining modifications of child support payments.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958 (decided under prior law).\n\nRole of appellate court.— Any change in child support is a matter within the discretion of the trial court and appellate review is limited to examining the record only to determine if the trial court abused its discretion by fixing an amount contrary to all reason.Henderson v. Lekvold, 1980-NMSC-133, 95 N.M. 288, 621 P.2d 505;Henderson v. Lekvold, 1983-NMSC-001, 99 N.M. 269, 657 P.2d 125.\n\nCredit for pre-order payments invalid modification.— The trial court erred in crediting the husband with child support \"prepayments.\" Parties may not, by private agreement, modify future child support obligations; rather, modification of future child support is a matter to be determined by the courts.Ingalls v. Ingalls, 1994-NMCA-148, 119 N.M. 85, 888 P.2d 967.\n\nA husband who made unauthorized \"prepayments\" of child support need not lose credit for his prepayments; the husband could file a petition to modify his future child support obligations and, in such a case, an agreement between the parties to the effect that the husband would \"prepay\" child support in exchange for a reduction in such payments in the future, coupled with actual payment in this manner, should receive serious consideration by the trial court in weighing prospective modification.Ingalls v. Ingalls, 1994-NMCA-148, 119 N.M. 85, 888 P.2d 967.\n\nStipulated agreements setting child support amounts modifiable.— Because the rights of the children, as innocent third parties, are involved in stipulated agreements setting child support amounts, to make such agreements nonmodifiable would not be in the best interests of the children and is therefore against the strong public policy of this state.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958.\n\nPast child support payments not modifiable.— Under former 22-7-6(C) (now 40-4-7G) NMSA 1978, a court does not have discretion to modify past, as distinguished from future, child support payments and arrearages once accrued cannot be forgiven.Gomez v. Gomez, 1978-NMSC-093, 92 N.M. 310, 587 P.2d 963,overruled on other groundsMontoya v. Montoya, 1980-NMSC-122, 95 N.M. 189, 619 P.2d 1233.\n\nBurden on party seeking to modify child support.— In a petition to modify the amount of child support, the burden of proof is on the moving party to satisfy the court that the circumstances have so changed as to justify the modification.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958;Schuermann v. Schuermann, 1980-NMSC-027, 94 N.M. 81, 607 P.2d 619.\n\nPresumption favors reasonableness of original decree.— Every presumption is in favor of the reasonableness of the original decree in a proceeding to modify a provision for the custody of minor children.Schuermann v. Schuermann, 1980-NMSC-027, 94 N.M. 81, 607 P.2d 619.\n\nIssue presented by petition to modify.— The issue before any trial court on a petition to modify the amount of child support payments is whether there has been a showing of a change in circumstances that is substantial.Smith v. Smith, 1982-NMSC-088, 98 N.M. 468, 649 P.2d 1381.\n\nBurden of proof is on the petitionerto satisfy the trial court that the circumstances have substantially changed, thereby justifying the requested modification.Smith v. Smith, 1982-NMSC-088, 98 N.M. 468, 649 P.2d 1381.\n\nRetroactive application of increase.— A child support increase should not apply retroactively where the trial court is dealing with present needs.Chavez v. Chavez, 1982-NMSC-104, 98 N.M. 678, 652 P.2d 228.\n\nChange must be substantial.— There must be a substantial change of circumstances to warrant a modification of child support occurring subsequent to the adjudication of the previous award.Chavez v. Chavez, 1982-NMSC-104, 98 N.M. 678, 652 P.2d 228.\n\nIf decree modified then changes measured from modification.— A trial court should not go back to the date a divorce decree was originally entered to determine a material change in circumstances, where a modified decree was entered for ascertaining the amount of child support. The doctrine of res judicata prevents the trial court from considering any matters prior to the modified decree.Smith v. Smith, 1982-NMSC-088, 98 N.M. 468, 649 P.2d 1381).\n\nRequirements for change of circumstances.— For a change in the amount of child support ordered, this section requires a showing of changed circumstances; the change must be substantial, materially affecting the existing welfare of the child, and must have occurred since the prior adjudication where child support was originally awarded.Unser v. Unser, 1974-NMSC-063, 86 N.M. 648, 526 P.2d 790.\n\nThe issue before a trial court on a petition to modify the amount of child support is whether there has been a showing of a change in circumstances; the change must be substantial, materially affecting the existing welfare of the child, and must have occurred since the prior adjudication where child support was originally awarded.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958;Henderson v. Lekvold, 1980-NMSC-133, 95 N.M. 288, 621 P.2d 505.\n\nTotality of circumstances needs considered in modifying child support award.Henderson v. Lekvold, 1980-NMSC-133, 95 N.M. 288, 621 P.2d 505.\n\nEffect on support of bad faith reduction in income.— Trial court's refusal to reduce the husband's child support obligation was not an abuse of discretion, where he was found not to have acted in good faith when he voluntarily made a career change which resulted in a major reduction of his income.Wolcott v. Wolcott, 1987-NMCA-038, 105 N.M. 608, 735 P.2d 326, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 618, 735 P.2d 535.\n\nDramatic increase in father's income as substantial change in circumstances.— A trial court's adamant refusal to consider a dramatic increase in a father's income as a substantial change in circumstances was arbitrary, capricious and beyond the bounds of reason.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958.\n\nProspective changes in financial condition not ground for modification.— Prospective changes in a parent's financial condition are not grounds for modification of a child support decree.Henderson v. Lekvold, 1980-NMSC-133, 95 N.M. 288, 621 P.2d 505.\n\nNo decrease in support upon voluntary assumption of excessive financial burdens.— A parent's duty to support his children is not decreased when a parent voluntarily assumes an excessive financial burden only for his convenience and investment.Henderson v. Lekvold, 1980-NMSC-133, 95 N.M. 288, 621 P.2d 505.\n\nChanges in total number of dependents being supported considered.— Evidence of changes in the total number of dependents being supported by both parties demands the attention of the court.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958.\n\nWhether custodial parent fostering good relations between noncustodial parent and children considered.— On a motion to modify child support payments, it is proper for the trial court to inquire as to whether the custodial parent is fulfilling the duty to foster good relations between the noncustodial parent and the children, as this may be considered as a factor bearing on the amount of child support that is granted over and above the normal necessities.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958.\n\nWhere a custodial parent is financially able to support the children and the children refuse to visit their other parent due to the emotional influence of the custodial parent, the court in its discretion has the power to terminate future support obligations of the noncustodial parent.Gomez v. Gomez, 1978-NMSC-093, 92 N.M. 310, 587 P.2d 963,overruled on other grounds by Montoya v. Montoya, 1980-NMSC-122, 95 N.M. 189, 619 P.2d 1233.\n\nImpact of subsequent remarriage on support obligation.— A subsequent remarriage by either or both of the parties may have some effect upon the financial resources available to support and maintain the children of divorced parents.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958;Henderson v. Lekvold, 1980-NMSC-133, 95 N.M. 288, 621 P.2d 505.\n\nMilitary allowances considered in determining change of circumstances.— Military allowances are proper sources of income that a state trial court can constitutionally consider in determining whether there has been a financial change of circumstances sufficient to warrant an increase of child support payments. So long as the action of the state court does not frustrate a substantial interest by preventing the military payments from reaching the designated beneficiary, the federal supremacy clause does not demand that state law be overridden.Peterson v. Peterson, 1982-NMSC-098, 98 N.M. 744, 652 P.2d 1195.\n\nRelief from child support where new facts.— Court may relieve defendant of the payment of future installments for child support, if new facts make such a change proper.Quintana v. Quintana, 1941-NMSC-038, 45 N.M. 429, 115 P.2d 1011;Lord v. Lord, 1932-NMSC-072, 37 N.M. 24, 16 P.2d 933, modified, 1933-NMSC-055, 37 N.M. 454, 24 P.2d 292.\n\nPrincipal issue on request for increased child supportis whether husband's circumstances have so changed as to warrant the increase requested. In order to determine whether such a change has occurred, it is necessary to examine into and consider his prior circumstances.Horcasitas v. House, 1965-NMSC-074, 75 N.M. 317, 404 P.2d 140.\n\nOn appeal from denial of petition to modify child supportthe reviewing court should decide whether the findings of the trial court are supported by substantial evidence, whether any refused findings should have been made and whether there was an abuse of discretion by the trial court.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958.\n\nF. POST-MAJORITY CHILD SUPPORT.\n\nLegislative intent behind Subsection C of this sectionis that post-minority education agreements in marital settlements may now merge into the divorce decree and the court has jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.Weddington v. Weddington, 2004-NMCA-034, 135 N.M. 198, 86 P.3d 623.\n\nOnce the parties have voluntarily agreed to provide for post-secondary education of their children,there exists an agreement that the district court can interpret, if it is ambiguous, and also enforce.Weddington v. Weddington, 2004-NMCA-034, 135 N.M. 198, 86 P.3d 623.\n\nEnforcement of parties' agreementregarding post-minority education is now governed by this section and the district court has jurisdiction to enforce the agreement after employing contract construction tools.Weddington v. Weddington, 2004-NMCA-034, 135 N.M. 198, 86 P.3d 623.\n\nPost-emancipation child support.— A parent's support obligation will continue past a child's emancipation only if the child is emancipated by age and still attending high school or if the parties to a marriage dissolution agree in writing to continue support.Diamond v. Diamond, 2011-NMCA-002, 149 N.M. 133, 245 P.3d 578, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-012, 150 N.M. 492, 263 P.3d 269.\n\nCourt cannot provide for children who have passed the age of majority.Psomas v. Psomas, 1982-NMSC-154, 99 N.M. 606, 661 P.2d 884,overruled in part byWalentwoski v. Walentowski, 1983-NMSC-097, 100 N.M. 484, 672 P.2d 657.\n\nTrial court does not have jurisdiction over post-minority educationfor children.Christiansen v. Christiansen, 1983-NMSC-058, 100 N.M. 102, 666 P.2d 781.\n\nAgreement for post-minority child support.— The district court has the power, arising from its original jurisdiction over matters sounding in contract, to enforce valid agreements for post-minority support.Ottino v. Ottino, 2001-NMCA-012, 130 N.M. 168, 21 P.3d 37, cert. quashed, 131 N.M. 363, 36 P.3d 953.\n\nA marriage settlement agreement covering post-minority support was not rendered unenforceable by its inclusion in the final divorce decree.Ottino v. Ottino, 2001-NMCA-012, 130 N.M. 168, 21 P.3d 37, cert. quashed, 131 N.M. 363, 36 P.3d 953.\n\nApplication of new age of majority to decree not unconstitutional.— Although trial court had continuing jurisdiction to modify divorce decree containing child custody provisions under the provisions of this section, that decree was considered final and not within the meaning of a \"pending case\" in N.M. Const., art. IV, § 34. Therefore, application of 28-6-1 NMSA 1978, which by its operation freed divorced father from making support payments to daughter who had reached age of 18, and thus, under the new section, was no longer a minor, was not unconstitutional.Phelps v. Phelps, 1973-NMSC-044, 85 N.M. 62, 509 P.2d 254.\n\nDisposition of property or funds for children upon reaching majority.— This statute only confers power on district court to provide for the children during their minority, and when they reach the age of 21 (now 18) years all power over them ceases and the district court must at this latter time make disposition of any property or funds created for the maintenance and education of such children.In re Coe's Estate, 1952-NMSC-078, 56 N.M. 578, 247 P.2d 162.\n\nThis section precludes the court from retaining control of any provision in decrees providing funds for post-minority education. When the children reach majority, the court must dispose of and relinquish control over any of the remaining funds created for their education.Spingola v. Spingola, 1979-NMSC-079, 93 N.M. 598, 603 P.2d 708 (decided under prior law).\n\nDuty of support for disabled child.— Parents have a common law continuing duty to support a severely disabled child if the child was disabled before reaching the age of majority, and the court had authority to enforce such duty.Cohn v. Cohn, 1997-NMCA-011, 123 N.M. 85, 934 P.2d 279.\n\nSubstantial evidence of disability and need for continued child support.— Where petitioner filed a motion to establish child support for her nineteen-year-old disabled son, evidence presented at trial that son was born with a genetic disorder and a clubbed foot, had an IQ in the severely impaired range, tested in the mildly to moderately impaired level in learning and memory skills, language functioning, visual, and motor skills, and was limited in all adaptive functioning areas, which include motor skills, social communication, personal living skills, and community living skills, provided a substantial evidentiary basis for the district court to conclude that son was disabled upon reaching majority and was an adult entitled to continuing child support.Gonzales v. Shaw, 2018-NMCA-059.\n\nTrial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to offset social security benefit.— Where petitioner filed a motion to establish child support for her nineteen-year-old disabled son, and where respondent argued that the district court erred in not deducting son's receipt of social security disability funds in making the court's child support calculation, the district court did not abuse its discretion in its child support calculation, because the social security funds received by son were the result of son's personal disability and did not come through either parent.Gonzales v. Shaw, 2018-NMCA-059.\n\nTrial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees and costs.— Where petitioner filed a motion to establish child support for her nineteen-year-old disabled son, and where respondent argued that the facts of the case did not rise to the level of an incapacitated adult child, despite son's defined disabilities, the trial court did not err in awarding petitioner her attorney fees and costs, where the evidence established that respondent ignored the medical expert's report and findings that son was disabled, declined to settle the case despite encouragement from the court to do so, and caused petitioner to incur additional costs and unnecessary attorney fees.Gonzales v. Shaw, 2018-NMCA-059.\n\nCourt's jurisdiction not extended by parties' agreements.— The jurisdiction of the court to enforce child support provisions in a divorce decree after the children have reached majority cannot be extended by agreement of the parties.Spingola v. Spingola, 1979-NMSC-079, 93 N.M. 598, 603 P.2d 708.\n\nVI. EXPENSES OF PROCEEDING.\n\nImplementation of Subsection A— Rules 1-054(E) and 1-127 NMRA appear to implement Subsection A of this section.Bursum v. Bursum, 2004-NMCA-133, 136 N.M. 584, 102 P.3d 651, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-003, 137 N.M. 290, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nCalifornia attorney fees.— With personal jurisdiction over both the wife and husband and subject matter jurisdiction over the division of their property, a New Mexico court could consider California attorney fees.Bursum v. Bursum, 2004-NMCA-133, 136 N.M. 584, 102 P.3d 651, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-003, 137 N.M. 290, 110 P.3d 506.\n\nRequest for attorney fees.— By presenting the court with an affidavit, mother sufficiently alerted the court's attention to her request for attorney fees and preserved this issue for appeal.Grant v. Cumiford, 2005-NMCA-058, 137 N.M. 485, 112 P.3d 1142.\n\nCentral purpose of attorney fees award under this sectionis to remedy any financial disparity between the divorcing parties so that each may make an efficient and effective presentation of his or her claims in the underlying divorce case.Garcia v. Jeantette, 2004-NMCA-004, 134 N.M. 776, 82 P.3d 947.\n\nAward of attorney fees to intervening third party not authorized.Subsection A of this section does not authorize the district court to order an intervening third party to pay attorney fees incurred by a divorcing party who was required to bring a separate action to collect on a judgment entered in the divorce proceeding.Garcia v. Jeantette, 2004-NMCA-004, 134 N.M. 776, 82 P.3d 947.\n\nConsideration of parties' economic disparity.— In making its award of attorneys' fees, the trial court properly considered the economic disparity between husband and wife and the husband's access to financial resources through his family.Monsanto v. Monsanto, 1995-NMCA-048, 119 N.M. 678, 894 P.2d 1034;Bustos v. Bustos, 2000-NMCA-040, 128 N.M. 842, 999 P.2d 1074.\n\nAttorneys' and witnesses' fees as community debts.— A trial court does not abuse its discretion when it includes attorneys' fees and wife's expert witness fees as community debts to be paid out of community assets.Christiansen v. Christiansen, 1983-NMSC-058, 100 N.M. 102, 666 P.2d 781.\n\nTrial court has authority to award wife attorneys' feesin divorce action, but such award is discretionary and will be reviewed only as to whether there has been an abuse of discretion.Fitzgerald v. Fitzgerald, 1962-NMSC-028, 70 N.M. 11, 369 P.2d 398.\n\nAmount of award for attorney feesrests within sound discretion of court; however, discretion in this regard must have been exercised with the purpose in mind of insuring the plaintiff an efficient preparation and presentation of her case. The facts upon which the trial court apparently relied for its conclusion that plaintiff was entitled to no further award of attorney fees can hardly be considered as demonstrating an exercise of sound discretion in determining that the money previously awarded was sufficient to insure her an efficient preparation and presentation of her case where she was precluded at the outset of the final hearing, and at every point thereafter, from citing any law or giving any testimony on the question of attorney fees.Burnside v. Burnside, 1973-NMSC-091, 85 N.M. 517, 514 P.2d 36.\n\nMany considerations enter into matter of fixing attorney fees,not the least important of which are: the ability, standing, skill and experience of the attorney; the nature and character of the controversy; the amount involved, the importance of the litigation and the benefits derived therefrom.Michelson v. Michelson, 1976-NMSC-026, 89 N.M. 282, 551 P.2d 638.\n\nDiscretion of the trial court in the award of attorney fees is not unrestrained and it should consider various factors, including the most important one of economic disparity.Gomez v. Gomez, 1995-NMCA-049, 119 N.M. 755, 895 P.2d 277, superseded by statute on other grounds,Erickson v. Erickson, 1999-NMCA-056, 127 N.M. 140, 978 P.2d 347.\n\nFees allowed even if husband relieved of alimony payments.— Where a divorced husband was relieved from further payment of alimony, the court might still award the wife counsel fees.Lord v. Lord, 1933-NMSC-055, 37 N.M. 454, 24 P.2d 292.\n\nDiscretion of court in awarding attorney fees.— The matter of attorney's fees lies within the discretion of the trial court, and its decision on this subject will not be disturbed unless an abuse of discretion is shown.Corliss v. Corliss, 1976-NMSC-023, 89 N.M. 235, 549 P.2d 1070.\n\nConsideration of obstructive behavior.— So long as an award of attorney fees under Subsection A of this section does not duplicate a sanction imposed for discovery abuse, obstructive behavior of a party during litigation is an appropriate factor for consideration in making such an award.Hakkila v. Hakkila, 1991-NMCA-029, 112 N.M. 172, 812 P.2d 1320, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 77, 811 P.2d 575.\n\nWhere nonmoving party refused to sign settlement agreement.— Attorney's fees, which are permitted by this section and were authorized under marital settlement agreement (MSA), were improperly denied by trial court, where nonmoving party's refusal to sign MSA was the cause of the action and required the fees to be incurred.Herrera v. Herrera, 1999-NMCA-034, 126 N.M. 705, 974 P.2d 675.\n\nAttorney's fees to be paid to spouse, not attorney.— An order directing the payment of attorney's fees by the husband in a divorce case direct to the wife's attorney is void. The wife is the party to the action, not the attorney, and the order must provide it be paid to her or to the clerk of the court for her benefit.Lloyd v. Lloyd, 1956-NMSC-007, 60 N.M. 441, 292 P.2d 121.\n\nAwards of attorney's fees in divorce actions are to the wife, not the attorney.Dunne v. Dunne, 1972-NMSC-002, 83 N.M. 377, 492 P.2d 994.\n\nAward not disturbed because attorney dissatisfied.— Trial court's award of attorney's fees approved by wife would not be disturbed because attorney was dissatisfied.Dunne v. Dunne, 1972-NMSC-002, 83 N.M. 377, 492 P.2d 994.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Federal Taxation of New Mexico Community Property,\" see 3 Nat.

      "text": "A. Parties to an action for divorce, separation, custody or time-sharing, child support, spousal support, marital property and debt division or attorney fees related to such matters, including any post-judgment proceeding, may stipulate to binding arbitration by a signed agreement that provides for an award with respect to one or more of the following issues:\n\n(1) valuation and division of real and personal property;\n\n(2) child support, custody, time-sharing or visitation;\n\n(3) spousal support;\n\n(4) costs, expenses and attorney fees;\n\n(5) enforceability of prenuptial and post-nuptial agreements;\n\n(6) determination and allocation of responsibility for debt as between the parties;\n\n(7) any civil tort claims related to any of the foregoing; or\n\n(8) other contested domestic relations matters.\n\nB. A court may not order a party to participate in arbitration except to the extent a party has agreed to participate pursuant to a written arbitration agreement. When the party involved is a minor, then his parent must consent to arbitration. When the party involved is a minor with a guardian ad litem, the guardian ad litem must provide written consent. When the party involved is a minor without a guardian ad litem, then in order for arbitration to proceed the court must find that arbitration is in the best interest of the minor.\n\nC. Arbitration pursuant to this section shall be heard by one or more arbitrator. The court shall appoint an arbitrator agreed to by the parties if the arbitrator consents to the appointment.\n\nD. If the parties have not agreed to an arbitrator, the court shall appoint an arbitrator who:\n\n(1) is an attorney in good standing with the state bar of New Mexico;\n\n(2) has practiced as an attorney for not less than five years immediately preceding the appointment and actively practiced in the area of domestic relations during three of those five years. Any period of time during which a person serves as a judge, special master or child support hearing officer is considered as actively practicing in the area of domestic relations; or\n\n(3) is another professional licensed and experienced in the subject matter that is the area of the dispute.\n\nE. An arbitrator appointed pursuant to this section is immune from liability in regard to the arbitration proceeding to the same extent as the judge who has jurisdiction of the action that is submitted to arbitration.\n\nF. Objections to the qualifications of an arbitrator must be raised in connection with the appointment by the court or they are waived. The court will permit parties to raise objections based on qualifications within ten days of appointment of an arbitrator. Parties who agree on an arbitrator waive objections to his qualifications.\n\nG. An arbitrator appointed pursuant to this section:\n\n(1) shall hear and make an award on each issue submitted for arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement subject to the provisions of the agreement; and\n\n(2) has all of the following powers and duties:\n\n(a) to administer an oath or issue a subpoena as provided by court rule;\n\n(b) to issue orders regarding discovery proceedings relative to the issues being arbitrated, including appointment of experts; and\n\n(c) to allocate arbitration fees and expenses between the parties, including imposing a fee or expense on a party or attorney as a sanction for failure to provide information, subject to provisions of the arbitration agreement.\n\nH. An arbitrator, attorney or party in an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this section shall disclose in writing any circumstances that may affect an arbitrator's impartiality, including, bias, financial interests, personal interests or family relationships. Upon disclosure of such a circumstance, a party may request disqualification of the arbitrator. If the arbitrator does not withdraw within seven days after a request for disqualification, the party may file a motion for disqualification with the court.\n\nI. If the court finds that the arbitrator is disqualified, the court may appoint another arbitrator, subject to the provisions of the arbitration agreement.\n\nJ. As soon as practicable after the appointment of the arbitrator, the parties and attorneys shall confer with the arbitrator to consider all of the following:\n\n(1) scope of the issues submitted;\n\n(2) date, time and place of the hearing;\n\n(3) witnesses, including experts, who may testify;\n\n(4) appointment of experts and a schedule for exchange of expert reports or summary of expert testimony; and\n\n(5) subject to the provisions of Subsection K of this section, exhibits, documents or other information each party considers material to the case and a schedule for production or exchange of the information. An objection not made before the hearing to production or lack of production of information is waived.\n\nK. The arbitrator shall order reasonable access to information for each party that is material to the arbitration issues prior to the hearing, including the following:\n\n(1) a current complete sworn financial disclosure statement, when financial matters are at issue;\n\n(2) if a court has issued an order concerning an issue subject to arbitration, a copy of the order;\n\n(3) any relevant documents related to the arbitration issues defined by the arbitrator;\n\n(4) proposed award by each party for each issue subject to arbitration; and\n\n(5) expert opinions of experts to be used by either party or appointed by the arbitrator.\n\nL. Except as provided by this section, court rule or the arbitration agreement, a record shall not ordinarily be made of an arbitration hearing pursuant to this section unless either party requests it. If a record is not required, an arbitrator may make a record to be used only by the arbitrator to aid in reaching the decision.\n\nM. Unless waived by the parties, a record shall be made of that portion of the hearing that concerns child custody, visitation or time-sharing.\n\nN. The arbitration agreement may set forth any standards on which an award should be based, including the law to be applied. An arbitration agreement shall provide that in deciding child support issues, the arbitrator shall apply Section 40-4-11.1 NMSA 1978 when setting or modifying a child support order.\n\nO. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties and arbitrator in writing or on the record, the arbitrator shall issue the written award on each issue within sixty days after the end of the hearing and after receipt of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law if requested by the arbitrator.\n\nP. If the parties reach an agreement regarding child custody, time-sharing or visitation, the agreement shall be placed on the record by the parties under oath and shall be included in the arbitrator's written award.\n\nQ. The arbitrator retains jurisdiction to correct errors or omissions in an award upon motion by a party to the arbitrator within twenty days after the award is issued or upon the arbitrator's own motion. Another party to the arbitration may respond to the motion within seven days after the motion is made. The arbitrator shall make a decision on the motion within seven days after the expiration of the response time period.\n\nR. The court shall enforce an arbitrator's award or other order issued pursuant to this section in the same manner as an order issued by the court. A party may make a motion to the court to enforce an arbitrator's award or order.\n\nS. Any party in an action that was submitted to arbitration pursuant to this section shall file with the court a stipulated order, or a motion to enforce the award within twenty-one days after the arbitrator's award is issued unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing or unless the arbitrator or court grants an extension.\n\nT. If a party applies to the court for vacation of an arbitrator's award in binding arbitration issued pursuant to this section that concerns child custody, time-sharing or visitation, the court shall review the award based only upon the record of the arbitration hearing and factual matters that have arisen since the arbitration hearing that are relevant to the claim. The court may vacate an award of custody, time-sharing or visitation made in binding arbitration if the court finds that circumstances have changed since issuance of the award that are adverse to the best interests of the child, upon a finding that the award will cause harm or be detrimental to a child, or pursuant to Subsections U and V of this section. An arbitration agreement may provide a broader scope of review of custody, time-sharing or visitation issues by the court, and such review will apply if broader than this section.\n\nU. If a party applies to the court for vacation or modification of an arbitrator's award issued pursuant to this section, the court shall review the award only as provided in Subsections T and V of this section.\n\nV. If a party applies under this section, the court may vacate, modify or correct an award under any of the following circumstances:\n\n(1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means;\n\n(2) there was evident partiality by an arbitrator, or misconduct prejudicing a party's rights;\n\n(3) the arbitrator exceeded his powers; or\n\n(4) the arbitrator refused to postpone the hearing on a showing of sufficient cause or refused to hear evidence substantial and material to the controversy.\n\nW. An application to vacate an award on grounds stated in Subsections U and V of this section shall be decided by the court. If an award is vacated on grounds stated in Paragraph (3) or (4) of Subsection V of this section, the court may order a rehearing before the arbitrator who made the award when both parties consent to the rehearing before the arbitrator who made the award.\n\nX. An appeal from an arbitration award pursuant to this section that the court confirms, vacates, modifies or corrects shall be taken in this same manner as from an order or judgment in other domestic relations actions.\n\nY. No arbitrator may decide issues of a criminal nature or make decisions on petitions pursuant to the Family Violence Protection Act [Chapter 40, Article 13, NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:Laws 1999, ch. 123, § 1.",

When custody is contested, the court:\n\n(1) shall refer that issue to mediation if feasible unless a party asserts or it appears to the court that domestic violence or child abuse has occurred, in which event the court shall halt or suspend mediation unless the court specifically finds that:\n\n(a) the following three conditions are satisfied: 1) the mediator has substantial training concerning the effects of domestic violence or child abuse on victims; 2) a party who is or alleges to be the victim of domestic violence is capable of negotiating with the other party in mediation, either alone or with assistance, without suffering from an imbalance of power as a result of the alleged domestic violence; and 3) the mediation process contains appropriate provisions and conditions to protect against an imbalance of power between the parties resulting from the alleged domestic violence or child abuse; or\n\n(b) in the case of domestic violence involving parents, the parent who is or alleges to be the victim requests mediation and the mediator is informed of the alleged domestic violence;\n\n(2) may order, in addition to or in lieu of the provisions of Paragraph (1) of this subsection, that each of the parties undergo individual counseling in a manner that the court deems appropriate, if the court finds that the parties can afford the counseling; and\n\n(3) may use, in addition to or in lieu of the provisions of Paragraph (1) of this subsection, auxiliary services such as professional evaluation by application of Rule 11-706 of the New Mexico Rules of Evidence or Rule 1-053 of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts.\n\nC. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"child abuse\" means:\n\n(a) that a child has been physically, emotionally or psychologically abused by a parent;\n\n(b) that a child has been: 1) sexually abused by a parent through criminal sexual penetration, incest or criminal sexual contact of a minor as those acts are defined by state law; or 2) sexually exploited by a parent through allowing, permitting or encouraging the child to engage in prostitution and allowing, permitting, encouraging or engaging the child in obscene or pornographic photographing or filming or depicting a child for commercial purposes as those acts are defined by state law;\n\n(c) that a child has been knowingly, intentionally or negligently placed in a situation that may endanger the child's life or health; or\n\n(d) that a child has been knowingly or intentionally tortured, cruelly confined or cruelly punished; provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to imply that a child who is or has been provided with treatment by spiritual means alone through prayer, in accordance with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination, by a duly accredited practitioner of the church or denomination, is for that reason alone a victim of child abuse within the meaning of this paragraph; and\n\n(2) \"domestic violence\" means one parent causing or threatening physical harm or assault or inciting imminent fear of physical, emotional or psychological harm to the other parent.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 22-7-7, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 286, § 1; 1993, ch. 241, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For guardian ad litem for infant defendant,see38-4-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor failure to apply for appointment of guardian ad litem,see38-4-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor liability of guardian ad litem for costs,see38-4-12 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor appointment of guardian ad litem to defend suit,see38-4-15 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor compromise by guardian ad litem,see38-4-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor costs paid by guardian ad litem,see38-4-17 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor guardians of minors,see45-5-201 to 45-5-212 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor guardians of incapacitated persons,see45-5-301 to 45-5-315 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor protection of property of persons under disability and minors,see45-5-401 to 45-5-431 NMSA 1978.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The section heading of this section in Laws 1977, ch. 286, § 1, designated this section as \"2277.\" The section number has been corrected in the history as set out above.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, designated the provisions of this section as Subsection A and added Subsections B and C.\n\nStanding of a parent to sue a guardian ad litem.— A parent does not have standing to sue a guardian ad litem appointed in a custody proceeding on behalf of the child because the parent has been found to be unable to act in the best interests of the child and such a lawsuit would create a conflict of interest in the custody case.Kimbrell v. Kimbrell, 2014-NMSC-027,rev'g2013-NMCA-070, 306 P.3d 495.\n\nImmunity of a guardian ad litem.— A guardian ad litem appointed pursuant to Rule 1-053.3 NMRA is protected by absolute quasi-judicial immunity from suit arising from the performance of the guardian ad litem's duties unless the guardian ad litem's alleged tortuous conduct is clearly and completely outside the scope of the guardian ad litem's appointment. The custody court that appointed the guardian ad litem is the appropriate court to determine whether the guardian ad litem's alleged misconduct arose from acts clearly and completely outside the scope of the appointment and, if so, the custody court should appoint a guardian ad litem, other than a parent, pursuant to Rule 1-017(C) NMRA to represent the child in any necessary litigation.Kimbrell v. Kimbrell, 2014-NMSC-027,rev'g2013-NMCA-070, 306 P.3d 495.\n\nWhere the guardian ad litem was appointed as an arm of the district court pursuant to Rule 1-053 NMRA; one parent, who obstructed the guardian ad litem's efforts to interview one of the children, filed a tort action against the guardian ad litem alleging that the guardian ad litem blocked the child's contact with the child's siblings; and the guardian ad litem was ordered by the district court to interview the children outside the presence of the parents and the attorneys, the guardian ad litem had the discretion to control communications between the children until the guardian ad litem completed the investigation and the guardian ad litem was absolutely immune from being sued for controlling communications between the siblings.Kimbrell v. Kimbrell, 2014-NMSC-027,rev'g2013-NMCA-070, 306 P.3d 495.\n\nParent's standing to sue guardian on behalf of the child.— Parents may sue their child's guardian ad litem for injuries caused by the guardian to the child if the guardian acts as a private advocate or exceeds the scope of the guardian's appointment as an arm of the court.Kimbrell v. Kimbrell, 2013-NMCA-070, 306 P.3d 495,rev'd, 2014-NMSC-027.\n\nGuardian ad litem liability for conspiracy.— Where, in a contentious divorce and child custody proceeding, plaintiff filed a tort action against defendant and the child's guardian ad litem alleging that they colluded to block telephone calls from the child to the child's siblings and plaintiff and defendant entered into a settlement agreement that released defendant from liability, although the action against defendant was moot, the action against the guardian was not moot because, as alleged conspirators, defendant and the guardian were jointly and severally liable.Kimbrell v. Kimbrell, 2013-NMCA-070, 306 P.3d 495,rev'd, 2014-NMSC-027.\n\nGuardian ad litem exceeded scope of appointment.— Where, in a contentious divorce and child custody proceeding, plaintiff filed a tort action against the child's guardian ad litem alleging that the guardian published the child's medical records to the court, defendant and defendant's counsel; increased conflict between the parties by rejecting settlement offers; failed to correct defendant's behavior when defendant ignored the child; failed to report defendant's efforts to block contact between the child and the child's siblings; and colluded with defendant to block telephone calls from the child to the child's siblings, the guardian was immune from suit for all of the guardian's acts except for the alleged act of colluding with defendant to block the child's telephone calls, which would exceed the scope of the guardian's appointment.Kimbrell v. Kimbrell, 2013-NMCA-070, 306 P.3d 495,rev'd, 2014-NMSC-027.\n\nDiscretion of court.— This section clearly makes it discretionary with the court as to whether an appointment of a guardian ad litem should be made.Lopez v. Lopez, 1981-NMSC-138, 97 N.M. 332, 639 P.2d 1186.\n\nDeduction of guardian fees from child support.— Nowhere in either the child support guidelines or the guardian ad litem statute is any specialized procedure outlined to insure the payment of guardian ad litem fees by deducting them from child support.Grant v. Cumiford, 2005-NMCA-058, 137 N.M. 485, 112 P.3d 1142.\n\nNature of guardian fees.— Guardian ad litem fees should not be treated any differently from any other attorney fees.Grant v. Cumiford, 2005-NMCA-058, 137 N.M. 485, 112 P.3d 1142.\n\nMediation not required.— The language of Subsection B(1) of this section and 40-4-9.1G NMSA 1978 permits the court to bypass mediation if it does not appear to be feasible, even in non-domestic violence or abuse situations.Thomas v. Thomas, 1999-NMCA-135, 128 N.M. 177, 991 P.2d 7, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 150, 990 P.2d 824.\n\nRemand of custody decision for representation of child.— When father waits to request findings of fact and conclusions of law until after court files custody judgment and he himself files his notice of appeal, lack of any findings in record precludes review of the evidence by appellate court on behalf of father; however, where child had no legal representative, disposition on behalf of child requires remand to district court for issuance of findings as to mental health of mother.Martinez v. Martinez, 1984-NMCA-026, 101 N.M. 493, 684 P.2d 1158.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —42 Am.

      "heading": "Standards for the determination of child custody; hearing.",
      "text": "A. In any case in which a judgment or decree will be entered awarding the custody of a minor, the district court shall, if the minor is under the age of fourteen, determine custody in accordance with the best interests of the child. The court shall consider all relevant factors including, but not limited to:\n\n(1) the wishes of the child's parent or parents as to his custody;\n\n(2) the wishes of the child as to his custodian;\n\n(3) the interaction and interrelationship of the child with his parents, his siblings and any other person who may significantly affect the child's best interest;\n\n(4) the child's adjustment to his home, school and community; and\n\n(5) the mental and physical health of all individuals involved.\n\nB. If the minor is fourteen years of age or older, the court shall consider the desires of the minor as to with whom he wishes to live before awarding custody of such minor.\n\nC. Whenever testimony is taken from the minor concerning his choice of custodian, the court shall hold a private hearing in his chambers. The judge shall have a court reporter in his chambers who shall transcribe the hearing; however, the court reporter shall not file a transcript unless an appeal is taken.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 22-7-7.1, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 172, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For notes regarding determination of child custody,see\"V. GRANTING AND MODIFYING CHILD CUSTODY AND SUPPORT.\" in notes following 40-4-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor provisions of the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act,see40-10A-101 to 40-10A-403 NMSA 1978.\n\nModifying custody.— The rule articulated inSchuermann v. Schuermann, 1980-NMSC-027, 94 N.M. 81, 607 P.2d 619, reflects an underlying policy favoring the continuation of child custody judgments in order to promote stability and continuity in the child's custodial and environmental relationships, absent a showing of a material change of conditions affecting the interests of the child.Seeley v. Jaramillo, 1986-NMCA-100, 104 N.M. 783, 727 P.2d 91.\n\nInapplicability.— The custody modification factors described in 40-4-9A NMSA 1978 are to be applied in the context of divorce proceedings not child abuse and neglect proceedings.State ex rel. Children, Youth and Families Dep't v. Lisa A., 2008-NMCA-087, 144 N.M. 324, 187 P.3d 189.\n\nIndian children.— The Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §1901, does not apply in divorce proceedings when the custody of children remain with the biological parents.Cherino v. Cherino, 2008-NMCA-024, 143 N.M. 452, 176 P.3d 1184.\n\nDiscretion of court to hold in-camera hearing.— The holding of an in-camera hearing under Subsection C is a matter entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court.Normand v. Ray, 1990-NMSC-006, 109 N.M. 403, 785 P.2d 743.\n\nTrial court's denial of an in-camera hearing to determine a child's preferences as to where she wanted to live was not error, where the court was otherwise adequately apprised of the child's wishes and there was evidence in the record otherwise supporting the ruling of the court.Jeantete v. Jeantete, 1990-NMCA-138, 111 N.M. 417, 806 P.2d 66.\n\nOlder child's preference not controlling.— Although the provisions of this section direct that the trial court shall consider the desires of a minor over 14 years of age concerning custody, under the statute, the trial court is not conclusively bound to award custody according to such preference. Instead, the controlling inquiry of the court in any child custody dispute involves a balancing of all relevant factors and determining the best interests of the child.Normand v. Ray, 1990-NMSC-006, 109 N.M. 403, 785 P.2d 743.\n\nBest interest of child controlling.— Trial court's decision to change primary physical custody of the parties' son from mother to father, was reasonable, where the child had reached the age at which the court was statutorily required to consider his desires, and the court clinic's advisory consultation report approved the change as being in the best interests of the child.Clayton v. Trotter, 1990-NMCA-078, 110 N.M. 369, 796 P.2d 262.\n\nJoint custody order requires a \"best interest\" analysis.— Where the district court changed a stipulated interim custody order that allowed mother to relocate with her four children from Ruidoso, New Mexico to Phoenix, Arizona, ordering that the children move back to Ruidoso to live with father during the school year, the district court abused its discretion in granting joint custody to mother and father and in awarding primary physical custody to father without making any specific findings related to any of the statutorily mandated factors relevant to a determination of the children's best interests that it was required to consider when making a custody determination.Hough v. Brooks, 2017-NMCA-050, cert. denied.\n\nEffect of custodial parent's subsequent incestuous marriage.— New Mexico's public policy against incest did not preclude the district court from awarding a mother primary physical custody of her children, after taking into account her plans to marry her uncle, where that choice was in the best interests of the children, and mother and uncle intended to reside in California.Leszinske v. Poole, 1990-NMCA-088, 110 N.M. 663, 798 P.2d 1049, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 533, 797 P.2d 983.\n\nSexual orientation not sufficient to deny visitation.— Sexual orientation, standing alone, is not a permissible basis for the denial of shared custody or visitation. Evidence of sexual and associational conduct may be relevant to determining the best interests of the child, but is not, by itself, sufficient to make that determination.A.C. v. C.B., 1992-NMCA-012, 113 N.M. 581, 829 P.2d 660, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 449, 827 P.2d 837.\n\nModification of award.— Because a final order was not entered until the custody-review hearing, a change in circumstances was not necessary to modify the court's joint custody award. Rather, the court was required to consider the standards for custody under this section and to comply with the requirements of Rule 1-052(B) NMRA.Fitzsimmons v. Fitzsimmons, 1986-NMCA-029, 104 N.M. 420, 722 P.2d 671, cert. quashed, 104 N.M. 378, 721 P.2d 1309.\n\nPresumption that child born in wedlock is legitimate is not conclusive.— The presumption may be rebutted where the evidence is clear, cogent and convincing that the husband is not the father of the child.Torres v. Gonzales, 1969-NMSC-020, 80 N.M. 35, 450 P.2d 921.\n\nRemand of custody decision for representation of child.— When father waits to request findings of fact and conclusions of law until after court files custody judgment and he himself files his notice of appeal, lack of any findings in record precludes review of the evidence by appellate court on behalf of father; however, where child had no legal representative, disposition on behalf of child requires remand to district court for issuance of findings as to mental health of mother.Martinez v. Martinez, 1984-NMCA-026, 101 N.M. 493, 684 P.2d 1158.\n\nFather awarded physical custody.— Where a mother, in the Marine Corps, had lived in six different locales in five years, and the father, because of his work schedule, allowed the parties' minor child to live with his sister, the court did not err in awarding father physical custody, but requiring him to maintain the child's present residence with her aunt, while maintaining joint legal custody.Brito v. Brito, 1990-NMCA-062, 110 N.M. 276, 794 P.2d 1205.\n\nOrder reversed for lack of evidence.— Trial court's order changing custody, apparently based on an allegation that the mother did not send the children to the father for a Christmas visit, was reversed, in the absence of the existence of any evidence in the record and the adoption of findings concerning the best interests and welfare of the children.Campbell v. Alpers, 1990-NMCA-037, 110 N.M. 21, 791 P.2d 472.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Domestic Relations - Racial Factors in Change of Custody Determinations: Palmore v. Sidoti,\" see 15 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. There shall be a presumption that joint custody is in the best interests of a child in an initial custody determination. An award of joint custody does not imply an equal division of financial responsibility for the child. Joint custody shall not be awarded as a substitute for an existing custody arrangement unless there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances since the entry of the prior custody order or decree, which change affects the welfare of the child such that joint custody is presently in the best interests of the child. With respect to any proceeding in which it is proposed that joint custody be terminated, the court shall not terminate joint custody unless there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child, since entry of the joint custody order, such that joint custody is no longer in the best interests of the child.\n\nB. In determining whether a joint custody order is in the best interests of the child, in addition to the factors provided in Section 40-4-9 NMSA 1978, the court shall consider the following factors:\n\n(1) whether the child has established a close relationship with each parent;\n\n(2) whether each parent is capable of providing adequate care for the child throughout each period of responsibility, including arranging for the child's care by others as needed;\n\n(3) whether each parent is willing to accept all responsibilities of parenting, including a willingness to accept care of the child at specified times and to relinquish care to the other parent at specified times;\n\n(4) whether the child can best maintain and strengthen a relationship with both parents through predictable, frequent contact and whether the child's development will profit from such involvement and influence from both parents;\n\n(5) whether each parent is able to allow the other to provide care without intrusion, that is, to respect the other's parental rights and responsibilities and right to privacy;\n\n(6) the suitability of a parenting plan for the implementation of joint custody, preferably, although not necessarily, one arrived at through parental agreement;\n\n(7) geographic distance between the parents' residences;\n\n(8) willingness or ability of the parents to communicate, cooperate or agree on issues regarding the child's needs; and\n\n(9) whether a judicial adjudication has been made in a prior or the present proceeding that either parent or other person seeking custody has engaged in one or more acts of domestic abuse against the child, a parent of the child or other household member. If a determination is made that domestic abuse has occurred, the court shall set forth findings that the custody or visitation ordered by the court adequately protects the child, the abused parent or other household member.\n\nC. In any proceeding in which the custody of a child is at issue, the court shall not prefer one parent as a custodian solely because of gender.\n\nD. In any case in which the parents agree to a form of custody, the court should award custody consistent with the agreement unless the court determines that such agreement is not in the best interests of the child.\n\nE. In making an order of joint custody, the court may specify the circumstances, if any, under which the consent of both legal custodians is required to be obtained in order to exercise legal control of the child and the consequences of the failure to obtain mutual consent.\n\nF. When joint custody is awarded, the court shall approve a parenting plan for the implementation of the prospective custody arrangement prior to the award of joint custody. The parenting plan shall include a division of a child's time and care into periods of responsibility for each parent. It may also include:\n\n(1) statements regarding the child's religion, education, child care, recreational activities and medical and dental care;\n\n(2) designation of specific decision-making responsibilities;\n\n(3) methods of communicating information about the child, transporting the child, exchanging care for the child and maintaining telephone and mail contact between parent and child;\n\n(4) procedures for future decision making, including procedures for dispute resolution; and\n\n(5) other statements regarding the welfare of the child or designed to clarify and facilitate parenting under joint custody arrangements.\n\nIn a case where joint custody is not agreed to or necessary aspects of the parenting plan are contested, the parties shall each submit parenting plans. The court may accept the plan proposed by either party or it may combine or revise these plans as it deems necessary in the child's best interests. The time of filing of parenting plans shall be set by local rule. A plan adopted by the court shall be entered as an order of the court.\n\nG. Where custody is contested, the court shall refer that issue to mediation if feasible. The court may also use auxiliary services such as professional evaluation by application of Rule 706 [Rule 11-706 NMRA] of the New Mexico Rules of Evidence or Rule 53 [Rule 1-053 NMRA] of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts.\n\nH. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, access to records and information pertaining to a minor child, including medical, dental and school records, shall not be denied to a parent because that parent is not the child's physical custodial parent or because that parent is not a joint custodial parent.\n\nI. Whenever a request for joint custody is granted or denied, the court shall state in its decision its basis for granting or denying the request for joint custody. A statement that joint custody is or is not in the best interests of the child is not sufficient to meet the requirements of this subsection.\n\nJ. An award of joint custody means that:\n\n(1) each parent shall have significant, well-defined periods of responsibility for the child;\n\n(2) each parent shall have, and be allowed and expected to carry out, responsibility for the child's financial, physical, emotional and developmental needs during that parent's periods of responsibility;\n\n(3) the parents shall consult with each other on major decisions involving the child before implementing those decisions; that is, neither parent shall make a decision or take an action which results in a major change in a child's life until the matter has been discussed with the other parent and the parents agree. If the parents, after discussion, cannot agree and if one parent wishes to effect a major change while the other does not wish the major change to occur, then no change shall occur until the issue has been resolved as provided in this subsection;\n\n(4) the following guidelines apply to major changes in a child's life:\n\n(a) if either parent plans to change his home city or state of residence, he shall provide to the other parent thirty days' notice in writing stating the date and destination of move;\n\n(b) the religious denomination and religious activities, or lack thereof, which were being practiced during the marriage should not be changed unless the parties agree or it has been otherwise resolved as provided in this subsection;\n\n(c) both parents shall have access to school records, teachers and activities. The type of education, public or private, which was in place during the marriage should continue, whenever possible, and school districts should not be changed unless the parties agree or it has been otherwise resolved as provided in this subsection;\n\n(d) both parents shall have access to medical and dental treatment providers and records. Each parent has authority to make emergency medical decisions. Neither parent may contract for major elective medical or dental treatment unless both parents agree or it has been otherwise resolved as provided in this subsection; and\n\n(e) both parents may attend the child's public activities and both parents should know the necessary schedules. Whatever recreational activities the child participated in during the marriage should continue with the child's agreement, regardless of which of the parents has physical custody. Also, neither parent may enroll the child in a new recreational activity unless the parties agree or it has been otherwise resolved as provided in this subsection; and\n\n(5) decisions regarding major changes in a child's life may be decided by:\n\n(a) agreement between the joint custodial parents;\n\n(b) requiring that the parents seek family counseling, conciliation or mediation service to assist in resolving their differences;\n\n(c) agreement by the parents to submit the dispute to binding arbitration;\n\n(d) allocating ultimate responsibility for a particular major decision area to one legal custodian;\n\n(e) terminating joint custody and awarding sole custody to one person;\n\n(f) reference to a master pursuant to Rule 53 [Rule 1-053 NMRA] of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts; or\n\n(g) the district court.\n\nK. When any person other than a natural or adoptive parent seeks custody of a child, no such person shall be awarded custody absent a showing of unfitness of the natural or adoptive parent.\n\nL. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"child\" means a person under the age of eighteen;\n\n(2) \"custody\" means the authority and responsibility to make major decisions in a child's best interests in the areas of residence, medical and dental treatment, education or child care, religion and recreation;\n\n(3) \"domestic abuse\" means any incident by a household member against another household member resulting in:\n\n(a) physical harm;\n\n(b) severe emotional distress;\n\n(c) a threat causing imminent fear of physical harm by any household member;\n\n(d) criminal trespass;\n\n(e) criminal damage to property;\n\n(f) stalking or aggravated stalking, as provided in Sections 30-3A-3 and 30-3A-3.1 NMSA 1978; or\n\n(g) harassment, as provided in Section 30-3A-2 NMSA 1978;\n\n(4) \"joint custody\" means an order of the court awarding custody of a child to two parents. Joint custody does not imply an equal division of the child's time between the parents or an equal division of financial responsibility for the child;\n\n(5) \"parent\" means a natural parent, adoptive parent or person who is acting as a parent who has or shares legal custody of a child or who claims a right to have or share legal custody;\n\n(6) \"parenting plan\" means a document submitted for approval of the court setting forth the responsibilities of each parent individually and the parents jointly in a joint custody arrangement;\n\n(7) \"period of responsibility\" means a specified period of time during which a parent is responsible for providing for a child's physical, developmental and emotional needs, including the decision making required in daily living. Specified periods of responsibility shall not be changed in an instance or more permanently except by the methods of decision making described under Subsection L [Subsection J] of this section;\n\n(8) \"sole custody\" means an order of the court awarding custody of a child to one parent; and\n\n(9) \"visitation\" means a period of time available to a noncustodial parent, under a sole custody arrangement, during which a child resides with or is under the care and control of the noncustodial parent.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 40-4-9.1, enacted by Laws 1981, ch. 112, § 1; reenacted by Laws 1986, ch. 41, § 1; 1999, ch. 242, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law. The reference in Subsection L(7) to Subsection L appears to be erroneous. The apparent intended reference is to Subsection J.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, added Subsection B(9); in Subsection L, added Paragraph (3), redesignated the subsequent paragraphs accordingly, and substituted \"decision making described under Subsection L of this section\" for \"decision making described under the definition of joint custody\" in Paragraph (7); and made stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nThe \"holding out\" provision with regard to paternity applies to women.— Where petitioner alleged that petitioner and respondent, who both were women, had a committed, long-term domestic relationship; they agreed to bring a child into their relationship; respondent adopted a child; petitioner never adopted the child; and petitioner supported respondent and the child financially, lived in the family home, held the child out as petitioner's natural child, and co-parented the child for a number of years before the parties dissolved their relationship; petitioner had standing to file an action under 40-11-12 NMSA 1978 (repealed,see40-11A-601 and 40-11A-602 NMSA 1978) because petitioner alleged sufficient facts to satisfy the hold out provision of Subsection A(4) of 40-11-5 NMSA 1978 (repealed,see40-11A-204 NMSA 1978) and if petitioner were able to establish a parent child relationship under the Uniform Parentage Act (repealed,seeNew Mexico Uniform Parentage Act, Chapter 40, Article 11A NMSA 1978), then petitioner would have standing to seek joint custody of the child under 40-4-9.1 NMSA 1978.Chatterjee v. King, 2012-NMSC-019, 280 P.3d 283,rev'g2011-NMCA-012,149 N.M. 625, 253 P.3d 915.\n\nRecreational expenses.— The requirement for including recreational expenses is implicit in the statutory provision governing joint custody. Section 40-4-9.1(J)(4)(e) NMSA 1978 states that when joint custody is awarded, \"whatever recreational activities the child participated in during the marriage should continue with the child's agreement, regardless of which of the parents has physical custody.\" This provision represents a legislative recognition of the importance of recreational activities to children. But the importance of an activity is not in itself a reason for separate inclusion of the expense for that activity in the child support guidelines. All ordinary expenses are presumably taken into consideration in establishing the guidelines for basic child support. The child support awarded under the guidelines should be adequate to feed and shelter the children, and to provide for recreational activities.Rosen v. Lantis, 1997-NMCA-033, 123 N.M. 231, 938 P.2d 729.\n\nStanding of non-parent to bring a custody claim.— Absent a showing of unfitness of the natural or adoptive parent, a person who is not the natural or adoptive parent does not have standing to bring a claim for custody.Chatterjee v. King, 2011-NMCA-012, 149 N.M. 625, 253 P.3d 915, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-001, 150 N.M. 558, 263 P.3d 900.\n\nWhere petitioner and respondent were in a committed relationship for several years; respondent adopted a child; petitioner did not adopt the child; petitioner and respondent lived as a family, jointly raised the child, and held themselves out as parents; petitioner provided financial and emotional support for the child, cared for the child, and formed a parental relationship with the child; and respondent ended the relationship and moved out with the child, petitioner did not have standing to bring a claim for custody of the child.Chatterjee v. King, 2011-NMCA-012, 149 N.M. 625, 253 P.3d 915, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-001, 150 N.M. 558, 263 P.3d 900.\n\nStanding of non-parent to bring claim for visitation.— The requirement that a non-parent show unfitness of a natural or adoptive parent before a court can consider a non-parent for custody is not relevant to a determination of visitation and a non-parent who establishes a prima facie case for a parent and child relationship may assert a claim for visitation.Chatterjee v. King, 2011-NMCA-012, 149 N.M. 625, 253 P.3d 915, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-001, 150 N.M. 558, 263 P.3d 900.\n\nWhere petitioner and respondent were in a committed relationship for several years; respondent adopted a child; petitioner did not adopt the child; petitioner and respondent lived as a family, jointly raised the child, and held themselves out as parents; and petitioner provided financial and emotional support for the child, cared for the child, and formed a parental relationship with the child, petitioner had a colorable claim for standing to bring a claim for visitation.Chatterjee v. King, 2011-NMCA-012, 149 N.M. 625, 253 P.3d 915, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-001, 150 N.M. 558, 263 P.3d 900.\n\nJoint custody not infringement on right to travel or relocate.— An order providing for joint custody and requiring the mother to give physical custody of her child to the father unless she returned to New Mexico did not unlawfully infringe upon her right to travel or to relocate.Alfieri v. Alfieri, 1987-NMCA-003, 105 N.M. 373, 733 P.2d 4.\n\nPresumption regarding joint custody.— There is a presumption that joint custody is in the best interests of the child.Grant v. Cumiford, 2005-NMCA-058, 137 N.M. 485, 112 P.3d 1142.\n\nCourt, in determining support, should consider all relevant factors.— Where primary custody of children is split between the parties and issues of child support are involved, the court in its broad discretion should consider all of the relevant factors and circumstances in order to achieve a fair balancing of the equities in light of the best interests and welfare of the children and the financial resources of the parents.DeTevis v. Aragon, 1986-NMCA-105, 104 N.M. 793, 727 P.2d 558.\n\nFactors considered.— In considering whether joint custody would promote the best interests of a child, the trial court must determine: (1) whether the child has established such relationships with both parents that he or she would benefit from joint custody; (2) that both parents are fit; (3) that both parents desire continuing involvement with the child; and (4) that both parents are able to communicate and cooperate in promoting the child's best interests. The ability to cooperate concerning joint child custody does not require the parents to have a totally amicable relationship, however: a successful joint custody arrangement requires that the parents be able to isolate their personal conflicts from their roles as parents and that the children be spared whatever resentments and rancor the parents may harbor.Sanchez v. Sanchez, 1988-NMCA-028, 107 N.M. 159, 754 P.2d 536, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 151, 754 P.2d 528.\n\nDiscretion of trial court.— A trial court has wide discretion in awarding custody of a child in a divorce case, and the welfare of the child is of primary importance in making the award.Creusere v. Creusere, 1982-NMSC-126, 98 N.M. 788, 653 P.2d 164.\n\nModification is discretionary.— Whether modification of the initial agreement is appropriate is a matter entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court, based upon the evidence submitted by the parties.Jeantete v. Jeantete, 1990-NMCA-138, 111 N.M. 417, 806 P.2d 66.\n\nScope of statement required in court's order.— The requirement, under the provisions of former Subsection B which are similar to those in present Subsection I, that the court must state its reasons for modifying a joint custody order is not satisfied by a simple statement that the circumstances of the parties and their minor child have materially changed since the entry of the final decree.Jaramillo v. Jaramillo, 1985-NMCA-062, 103 N.M. 145, 703 P.2d 922.\n\nRequirement of statement in the custody order.— The plain language of this section requires the court to set forth in its decision the basis for its determination either granting or denying joint custody.Jeantete v. Jeantete, 1990-NMCA-138, 111 N.M. 417, 806 P.2d 66.\n\nAdequacy of statement in court order.— Trial court adequately articulated the basis for its denial of a motion for modification of visitation, where the motion did not specifically seek the granting or denial of joint custody, and the court's order denying modification recited in applicable part: \"the motion is denied because the father failed to allege or prove the existence of a material change of circumstances relating to the child.\"Jeantete v. Jeantete, 1990-NMCA-138, 111 N.M. 417, 806 P.2d 66.\n\nJoint custody award.— As specified by Subsection J(1), an award of joint custody means that \"each parent shall have significant, well-defined periods of responsibility for the child\"; however, joint custody awards need not equally divide the time period relating to the child's physical custody.Jeantete v. Jeantete, 1990-NMCA-138, 111 N.M. 417, 806 P.2d 66.\n\nWhen joint custody parents fail to accommodate one anotherand cannot reach agreement, even with the assistance of counselors, conciliators, mediators or arbitrators, the court has few options available; it may make the controverted decision itself and enforce its determination without changing the legal status of the parents, or it may reevaluate the best interests of the children in light of either or both parents' failure to fulfill joint custody responsibilities, and modify their custody.Strosnider v. Strosnider, 1984-NMCA-082, 101 N.M. 639, 686 P.2d 981.\n\nDiscretion of court in making award.— Where a mother, in the Marine Corps, had lived in six different locales in five years, and the father, because of his work schedule, allowed the parties' minor child to live with his sister, the court did not err in awarding father physical custody, but requiring him to maintain the child's present residence with her aunt, while maintaining joint legal custody.Brito v. Brito, 1990-NMCA-062, 110 N.M. 276, 794 P.2d 1205.\n\nDetermination not overturned absent abuse of discretion.— The determination of the trial judge in a joint custody decision who saw the parties, observed their demeanor and heard their testimony will not be overturned absent a manifest abuse of discretion.Creusere v. Creusere, 1982-NMSC-126, 98 N.M. 788, 653 P.2d 164.\n\nDenial of joint custody for incompatibility.— The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying joint custody and in granting sole custody to the wife when the level of incompatibility between the husband and wife was not in the child's best interest and, thus, did not support joint custody of the child.Creusere v. Creusere, 1982-NMSC-126, 98 N.M. 788, 653 P.2d 164.\n\nBurden on party seeking to modify joint custody decree.— A party seeking to modify a decree of joint custody must overcome the presumption of the reasonableness of the original decree.Jeantete v. Jeantete, 1990-NMCA-138, 111 N.M. 417, 806 P.2d 66.\n\nBurden of proof in modification of joint custody arrangements.— In a joint custody arrangement, when one party initiates a proceeding to alter an existing custody arrangement, the party seeking such change has the burden to show that the existing arrangement is no longer workable. Each party will then have the burden to persuade the court that the new custody arrangement or parenting plan proposed by him or her should be adopted by the court, but that party's failure to carry this burden will only mean that the court remains free to adopt the arrangement or plan that it determines best promotes the child's interests.Jaramillo v. Jaramillo, 1991-NMSC-101, 113 N.M. 57, 823 P.2d 299.\n\nNotice and hearing required.— Joint custody cannot be terminated except after a hearing following specific notice that continuation of joint custody will be at issue.Taylor v. Tittman, 1995-NMCA-034, 120 N.M. 22, 896 P.2d 1171.\n\nModification of joint custody warranted.— Whether or not there was proof of \"emotional damage\" per se, the observation that the parties' continuing inability to cooperate was affecting the children was a sufficient change in circumstance to support the modification of joint custody.Thomas v. Thomas, 1999-NMCA-135, 128 N.M. 177, 991 P.2d 7, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 150, 990 P.2d 824.\n\nModification to joint custody reversed.— Judgment changing sole custody in the mother to joint legal custody, unless and until the mother was able to comply with a parenting plan agreed to by the parties, was reversed, where the trial court's findings failed to resolve basic issues material and necessary to a determination that modification of the initial custody agreement to joint custody was in the best interests of the children.Newhouse v. Chavez, 1988-NMCA-110, 108 N.M. 319, 772 P.2d 353, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 197, 769 P.2d 731 (1989).\n\nModification of existing custody arrangement requires a showing of substantial and material change in circumstances.— Where the district court changed a stipulated interim custody order that allowed mother to relocate with her four children from Ruidoso, New Mexico to Phoenix, Arizona, ordering that the children move back to Ruidoso to live with father during the school year, the district court abused its discretion in ordering joint custody without making a finding that there was a substantial and material change in circumstances, because although the interim order was not a final order, the plain language of this section states that joint custody shall not be awarded as a substitute for any existing custody arrangement that is instituted by court order or decree, unless there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances, and there was nothing in the stipulated interim order establishing that the custody arrangement was temporary or subject to change.Hough v. Brooks, 2017-NMCA-050, cert. denied.\n\nJoint custody order requires a \"best interest\" analysis.— Where the district court changed a stipulated interim custody order that allowed mother to relocate with her four children from Ruidoso, New Mexico to Phoenix, Arizona, ordering that the children move back to Ruidoso to live with father during the school year, the district court abused its discretion in granting joint custody to mother and father and in awarding primary physical custody to father without making any specific findings related to any of the statutorily mandated factors relevant to a determination of the children's best interests that it was required to consider when making a custody determination.Hough v. Brooks, 2017-NMCA-050, cert. denied.\n\nRelocation of custodial parent.— In situations in which one parent has sole custody of the child, the custodian seeking to relocate with a child is entitled to a presumption that the move is in the best interests of the child, and the burden is on the noncustodial parent to show that the move is against those interests or motivated by bad faith on the part of the custodial parent. However, the designation of one parent as \"primary physical custodian\" under a court-approved parenting plan in a joint custody situation simply means that the child resides with that parent more than half the time. Consequently, one parent's status as primary physical custodian has no particular significance and should not entitle that parent to the benefit of any presumption.Jaramillo v. Jaramillo, 1991-NMSC-101, 113 N.M. 57, 823 P.2d 299.\n\nBurden on relocating party impermissible.— In joint custody cases, placing the burden on the party seeking to relocate to show that the relocation is in the best interests of the child unconstitutionally impairs the relocating parent's right to travel.Jaramillo v. Jaramillo, 1991-NMSC-101, 113 N.M. 57, 823 P.2d 299.\n\nModification of joint custody by awarding primary physical custody to father.— Where father filed for a change of custody of his two children, requesting that he be awarded sole legal custody and that he be permitted to relocate to another state with his children, the district court's order, awarding primary physical custody to father and permitting father to relocate children to another state, intended only to modify, not terminate, joint custody, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in modifying joint custody because it considered all of the factors necessary in determining whether relocation was in the best interests of the children.Hopkins v. Wollaber, 2019-NMCA-024.\n\nMediation not required.— The language of Subsection G of this section and 40-4-8B(1) NMSA 1978 permits the court to bypass mediation if it does not appear to be feasible, even in non-domestic violence or abuse situations.Thomas v. Thomas, 1999-NMCA-135, 128 N.M. 177, 991 P.2d 7, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 150, 990 P.2d 824.\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico law relating to domestic relations, see 12 N.M.L.

      "text": "In any proceeding before a court in which the court has the duty or authority to determine liability of a parent for the support of minor children or the amount of that support, the court:\n\nA. shall make a specific determination and finding of the amount of support to be paid by a parent to provide properly for the care, maintenance and education of the minor children, considering the financial resources of the parent;\n\nB. shall not consider present or future welfare financial assistance payments to or on behalf of the children in making its determination under Subsection A of this section; and\n\nC. for good cause may order the parent liable for support of a minor child to assign to the person or public office entitled to receive the child support that portion of the parent's periodic income or other periodic entitlements to money. The assignment of that portion of the parent's periodic income or other periodic entitlements to money may be ordered by the court by the issuance of a notice to withhold income against the income of the parent. The procedures for the issuance of the notice to withhold income, the content of the notice to withhold income, the duties of the parent liable for child support and the duties of the employer responsible for withholding income shall be the same as provided for in the Support Enforcement Act [40-4A-1 to 40-4A-20 NMSA 1978], except that delinquency in payment under an order for support need not be a pre-existing condition to effectuate the procedures of the Support Enforcement Act for purpose of withholding income under this section.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 40-4-11, enacted by Laws 1988, ch. 87, § 3.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1988, ch. 87, § 3 repealed former 40-4-11 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1987, ch. 340, § 1, and enacted a new section, effective March 8, 1988.\n\nCross references.— For the Parental Responsibility Act,see40-5A-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 1988, ch. 87, § 1 amended 40-4-11 NMSA 1978 as amended by Laws 1987, ch. 340, § 1, and Laws 1988, ch. 87, § 3 repealed and reenacted the same section, both effective March 8, 1988. Pursuant to instructions of the New Mexico compilation commission, both versions of the section have been set out. The notes below are applicable to both versions of this section.\n\nIn Leeder v. Leeder, 118 N.M. 603, 884 P.2d 494 (Ct. App. 1994), the court discussed the interpretation of these two sections and concluded that reading the second version of this section, Subsection A of 40-4-11.1 and 40-4-11.2 NMSA 1978 together, the guidelines are presumed to provide the proper amount of child support and that the second version of this section is ordinarily satisfied if the court sets forth the computations made under the guidelines. The second version of this section requires additional findings only when the children's needs for care, maintenance, and education, in light of the parents' financial resources, justify a departure from the guidelines. Although under this interpretation there is substantial overlap in what is required by Subsection A of the second version of this section, Subsection A of 40-4-11.1 and 40-4-11.2 NMSA 1978, there is no way to avoid the overlap without distorting the meaning of the statutory language for no discernible purpose. Statutes which relate to the same subject matter should, if possible, be construed to give effect to every provision of each.\n\nRecreational expenses.— The requirement for including recreational expenses is implicit in the statutory provision governing joint custody. Section 40-4-9.1(J)(4)(e) NMSA 1978 states that when joint custody is awarded, \"whatever recreational activities the child participated in during the marriage should continue with the child's agreement, regardless of which of the parents has physical custody.\" This provision represents a legislative recognition of the importance of recreational activities to children. But the importance of an activity is not in itself a reason for separate inclusion of the expense for that activity in the child support guidelines. All ordinary expenses are presumably taken into consideration in establishing the guidelines for basic child support. The child support awarded under the guidelines should be adequate to feed and shelter the children, and to provide for recreational activities.Rosen v. Lantis, 1997-NMCA-033, 123 N.M. 231, 938 P.2d 729.\n\nProvisions of section are mandatoryand require that evidence of the father's current financial resources be fully considered by the court and a finding be made based on that evidence.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958;Blake v. Blake, 1985-NMCA-009, 102 N.M. 354, 695 P.2d 838.\n\nFinding required as to proper amount payable, or basis for denial.— When an issue is directly raised involving a demand for payment of child support, it is error to refuse to adopt a finding as to the amount of child support properly payable from the noncustodial parent to the custodial parent, or to refuse to adopt a finding indicating the basis for denial of the request for child support.DeTevis v. Aragon, 1986-NMCA-105, 104 N.M. 793, 727 P.2d 558.\n\nTotal financial resources of both parents considered.— In providing for the welfare of a child of divorced parents the trial court should consider the total financial resources of both parents, including their monetary obligations, income and net worth.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958.\n\nEffect of number of children.— Although the number of children involved is a factor for consideration in the amount of a child support award, experience indicates that the support level for one child must be considerably higher than that necessary for the additional children.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958.\n\nChildren's ages considered.— In determining amounts of child support payments, the court must look at the ages, physical condition and health of the parents and the children. It must consider whether the children have advanced into an age bracket where the expenses of caring for and maintaining them are substantially greater. Likewise the attainment of majority by a child will affect the amount of support to be paid.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958.\n\nEducational needs considered.— One of the paramount concerns of the courts in child support cases is that a high level of education and training be afforded children, and the finest education that the parents can reasonably afford should be the criterion.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958.\n\nAdditional advantages to children above their actual needs.— Where the income, surrounding financial circumstances and station in life of the father demonstrate an ability on his part to furnish additional advantages to his children above their actual needs, the trial court should provide such advantages within reason.Spingola v. Spingola, 1978-NMSC-045, 91 N.M. 737, 580 P.2d 958.\n\nSpecific findings by the court.— The child support guidelines are presumed to provide the proper amount of child support and Subsection A is ordinarily satisfied if the court sets forth the computations made under the guidelines. Additional findings are required only when the children's needs for care, maintenance, and education, in light of the parents' financial resources, justify a departure from the guidelines.Leeder v. Leeder, 1994-NMCA-105, 118 N.M. 603, 884 P.2d 494.\n\nUndivided support award directed at more than one childis presumed to continue in force for the full amount until the youngest child reaches majority.Britton v. Britton, 1983-NMSC-084, 100 N.M. 424, 671 P.2d 1135.\n\nCourt may not on own motion reduce support.— Where there is no evidence before the trial court as to the salaries or financial resources of the husband or the wife in an action to collect delinquent child support, the court may not on its own motion reduce the support payments.Pitcher v. Pitcher, 1978-NMSC-029, 91 N.M. 504, 576 P.2d 1135.\n\nPrincipal issue on request for increased child supportis whether husband's circumstances have so changed as to warrant the increase requested. In order to determine whether such a change has occurred, it is necessary to examine into and consider his prior circumstances.Horcasitas v. House, 1965-NMSC-074, 75 N.M. 317, 404 P.2d 140.\n\nTrial court erred in refusing to consider community earnings of husband's new wifein determining whether the husband's child support obligations should be increased.DeTevis v. Aragon, 1986-NMCA-105, 104 N.M. 793, 727 P.2d 558.\n\nBiological father cannot relinquish duties.— In the absence of a formal adoption under the Adoption Act, the biological father cannot voluntarily effect a relinquishment of his parental obligation to pay child support.Poncho v. Bowdoin, 2006-NMCA-013, 138 N.M. 857, 126 P.3d 1221.\n\nEquitable adoption.— Doctrine of equitable adoption cannot be asserted by biological father to avoid payment of child support.Poncho v. Bowdoin, 2006-NMCA-013, 138 N.M. 857, 126 P.3d 1221.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Child Support Enforcement: The New Mexico Experience,\" see 9 N.M.L.

      "heading": "Child support; guidelines.",
      "text": "A. In any action to establish or modify child support, the child support guidelines as set forth in this section and the child support schedule promulgated by the department shall be applied to determine the child support due and shall be a rebuttable presumption for the amount of such child support. Every decree or judgment or stipulation of child support that deviates from the guideline amount shall contain a statement of the reasons for the deviation.\n\nB. The purposes of the child support guidelines are to:\n\n(1) establish as state policy an adequate standard of support for children, subject to the ability of parents to pay;\n\n(2) make awards more equitable by ensuring more consistent treatment of persons in similar circumstances; and\n\n(3) improve the efficiency of the court process by promoting settlements and giving courts and the parties guidance in establishing levels of awards.\n\nC. For purposes of the guidelines specified in this section:\n\n(1) \"income\" means actual gross income of a parent if employed to full capacity or potential income if unemployed or underemployed. The gross income of a parent means only the income and earnings of that parent and not the income of subsequent spouses, notwithstanding the community nature of both incomes after remarriage; and\n\n(2) \"gross income\" includes income from any source and includes but is not limited to income from salaries, wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, dividends, severance pay, pensions, interest, trust income, annuities, capital gains, social security benefits, workers' compensation benefits, unemployment insurance benefits, disability insurance benefits, significant in-kind benefits that reduce personal living expenses, prizes and alimony or maintenance received, provided:\n\n(a) \"gross income\" shall not include benefits received from: 1) means-tested public assistance programs, including but not limited to temporary assistance for needy families, supplemental security income and general assistance; 2) the earnings or public assistance benefits of a child who is the subject of a child support award; or 3) child support received by a parent for the support of other children;\n\n(b) for income from self-employment, rent, royalties, proprietorship of a business or joint ownership of a partnership or closely held corporation, \"gross income\" means gross receipts minus ordinary and necessary expenses required to produce such income, but ordinary and necessary expenses do not include expenses determined by the court to be inappropriate for purposes of calculating child support;\n\n(c) \"gross income\" shall not include the amount of alimony payments actually paid in compliance with a court order;\n\n(d) \"gross income\" shall not include the amount of child support actually paid by a parent in compliance with a court order for the support of prior children; and\n\n(e) \"gross income\" shall not include a reasonable amount for a parent's obligation to support prior children who are in that parent's custody. A duty to support subsequent children is not ordinarily a basis for reducing support owed to children of the parties but may be a defense to a child support increase for the children of the parties. In raising such a defense, a party may use Table A as set forth in Subsection M of this section to calculate the support for the subsequent children.\n\nD. If a court finds that a parent has willfully failed to obtain or maintain appropriate employment or is willfully underemployed, the court may impute to that parent an income equal to that parent's earning and employment potential.\n\n(1) The following criteria shall be used:\n\n(a) availability of employment opportunities for the parent;\n\n(b) the parent's employment history;\n\n(c) the parent's income history;\n\n(d) the parent's job skills;\n\n(e) the parent's education;\n\n(f) the parent's age and health;\n\n(g) the parent's history of convictions and incarceration; and\n\n(h) the parent's ability to obtain or maintain employment due to providing care for a child of the parties who is under the age of six or is disabled.\n\n(2) Minimum wage may be imputed if a parent has no recent employment or earnings history and that parent has the capacity to earn minimum wage. The minimum wage to be imputed to that parent is the prevailing minimum wage in the locality where that parent resides.\n\nE. Income may not be imputed to a parent if the parent is incarcerated for a period of one hundred eighty days or longer. Incarceration is not considered a voluntary unemployment.\n\nF. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"department\" means the human services department [health care authority department];\n\n(2) \"children of the parties\" means the natural or adopted child or children of the parties to the action before the court but shall not include the natural or adopted child or children of only one of the parties;\n\n(3) \"basic visitation\" means a custody arrangement whereby one parent has physical custody and the other parent has visitation with the children of the parties less than thirty-five percent of the time. Such arrangements can exist where the parties share responsibilities pursuant to Section 40-4-9.1 NMSA 1978;\n\n(4) \"shared responsibility\" means a custody arrangement whereby each parent provides a suitable home for the children of the parties, when the children of the parties spend at least thirty-five percent of the year in each home and the parents significantly share the duties, responsibilities and expenses of parenting; and\n\n(5) \"schedule\" means the child support schedule promulgated by the department.\n\nG. The basic child support obligation shall be calculated based on the combined income of both parents and shall be paid by them proportionately pursuant to Subsection L of this section.\n\nH. Physical custody adjustments shall be made as follows:\n\n(1) for basic visitation situations, the basic child support obligation shall be calculated using the basic child support schedule promulgated by the department, Worksheet A and instructions contained in Subsection M of this section. The court may provide for a partial abatement of child support for visitations of one month or longer; and\n\n(2) for shared responsibility arrangements, the basic child support obligation shall be calculated using the basic child support schedule promulgated by the department, Worksheet B and instructions contained in Subsection M of this section.\n\nI. In shared responsibility situations, each parent retains the percentage of the basic support obligation equal to the number of twenty-four-hour days of responsibility spent by each child with each respective parent divided by three hundred sixty-five.\n\nJ. The cost of providing medical and dental insurance for the children of the parties and the net reasonable child-care costs incurred on behalf of these children due to employment or job search of either parent shall be paid by each parent in proportion to that parent's income, in addition to the basic obligation.\n\nK. The child support may also include the payment of the following expenses not covered by the basic child support obligation:\n\n(1) any extraordinary medical, dental and counseling expenses incurred on behalf of the children of the parties. Such extraordinary expenses are uninsured expenses in excess of one hundred dollars ($100) per child per year;\n\n(2) any extraordinary educational expenses for children of the parties; and\n\n(3) transportation and communication expenses necessary for long distance visitation or time sharing.\n\nL. Whenever application of the child support guidelines set forth in this section requires a person to pay to another person more than forty percent of the paying person's gross income for a single child support obligation for current support, there shall be a presumption of a substantial hardship, justifying a deviation from the guidelines.\n\nM. The department shall:\n\n(1) establish the basic child support schedule by rule, using the recommendations of the child support guidelines review commission as the initial proposed rules; and\n\n(2) update and adjust the basic child support schedule when such a change is necessary to ensure that the child support schedule complies with the child support guidelines set forth in this section. The basic child support schedule shall be promulgated pursuant to the State Rules Act and shall be published and available to the public through the New Mexico Administrative Code, the New Mexico supreme court's website and the department's website. When the department is developing or updating the child support schedule, it shall consider:\n\n(a) all of the earnings and income of the noncustodial and custodial parent;\n\n(b) the basic subsistence needs of a noncustodial parent who may have a limited ability to pay by incorporating a mechanism that adjusts the basic support obligation for low-income parents;\n\n(c) economic data on the costs of raising children;\n\n(d) state and local labor market data; and\n\n(e) regional and national trends in child support schedule adjustments.\n\nWORKSHEET A - BASIC VISITATION\n\n__________ JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT\n\nCOUNTY OF _________________________\n\nSTATE OF NEW MEXICO\n\nNO. _____________________\n\n___________________________________,Petitioner,\n\n___________________________________,Respondent.\n\nMONTHLY CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATION\n\nGross Monthly Income\n\nPercentage of Combined Income\n\n(Each parent's income divided\n\nby combined income)\n\nNumber of Children ______\n\nBasic Support from Schedule\n\n(Use combined income from Line 1)\n\nChildren's Health and\n\nDental Insurance Premium\n\nWork-Related Child Care\n\nAdditional Expenses\n\nTotal Support (Add\n\nLines 5, 6 and\n\n7 for each parent\n\nand Lines 4, 5, 6 and 7 for combined\n\nEach Parent's Obligation\n\n(Combined Column Line\n\n8 x each parent's\n\nEnter amount for\n\neach parent from\n\nEach Parent's Net\n\nObligation (Subtract\n\nLine 10 from Line 9\n\nfor each parent).\n\nParent pays Custodial\n\nParent this Amount\n\n_______________PAYS______________ EACH MONTH $_________\n\n______________________Petitioner's Signature\n\n______________________Respondent's Signature\n\nDate: _______________________\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nBASIC VISITATIONINSTRUCTIONS FOR WORKSHEET A\n\nLine 1.

Gross Monthly Income:\n\nIncludes all income, except temporary assistance for needy families, food stamps and supplemental security income. See text for allowed deductions from income. Use current income if steady. If income varies a lot from month to month, use an average of the last twelve months, if available, or last year's income tax return. Add both parents' gross incomes and put total under the combined column.\n\nLine 2. Percentage of Combined Income:\n\nDivide each parent's income by combined income to get that parent's percentage of combined income.\n\nLines 3 and 4. Basic Support:\n\nFill in the number of children on the worksheet (Line 3). Round combined income to nearest fifty dollars ($50.00). Look at the basic child support schedule. In the far left-hand column of that schedule, find the rounded combined income figure. Read across to the column with the correct number of children. Enter that amount on Line 4.\n\nLine 5. Shared Responsibility Basic Obligation:\n\nMultiply the basic obligation on Line 4 by 1.5.\n\nLine 6. Each Parent's Share:\n\nMultiply the support amount on Line 5 by each parent's percentage share on Line 2, and enter each parent's dollar share under that parent's column on Line 6.\n\nLine 7. Each Parent's Time of Care for Children:\n\nEnter the number of twenty-four-hour days of responsibility that each parent has each child in a year according to the parenting plan.\n\nLine 8. Percentage of Twenty-Four-Hour Days With Each Parent:\n\nDivide each parent's number of twenty-four-hour days (Line 7) by three hundred sixty-five to obtain a percentage.\n\nLine 9. Amount Retained:\n\nUnder shared responsibility arrangements, each parent retains the percentage of the basic support obligation equal to the number of twenty-four-hour days of responsibility spent by each child with each respective parent divided by three hundred sixty-five. Multiply each parent's share of basic support (Line 6) by the percentage in that parent's Line 8 and enter the result on that parent's Line 9. This is the amount that each parent retains to pay the children's expenses during that parent's periods of responsibility.\n\nLine 10. Each Parent's Basic Obligation:\n\nSubtract the amount retained by each parent for direct expenses (Line 9) from that parent's share (Line 6) and enter the difference on that parent's Line 10.\n\nLine 11. Amount Transferred for Basic Support:\n\nIn shared responsibility situations, both parents are entitled not only to retain money for direct expenses but also to receive contributions from the other parent toward those expenses. Therefore, subtract the smaller amount on Line 10 from the larger amount on Line 10 to arrive at a net amount transferred for basic support.\n\nPart 2 - Additional Payments:\n\nLine 12. Children's Health and Dental Insurance Premium: Enter the cost paid by a parent for covering these children with medical and dental insurance under that parent's column on Line 12. Add costs paid by each parent and enter under the combined column on Line 12.\n\nLine 13. Work-Related Child Care:\n\nEnter the cost paid by each parent for work-related child care. If the cost varies (for example, between school year and summer), take the total yearly cost and divide by twelve. Enter each parent's figure in that parent's column on Line 13. Add the cost for both parents and enter in the combined column on Line 13.\n\nLine 14. Additional Expenses:\n\nEnter the cost paid by each parent for additional expenses provided by Subsection J of this section on Line 14.\n\nLine 15. Total Additional Payments:\n\nFor each parent, total the amount paid by that parent for insurance, child care and additional expenses (Lines 12, 13 and 14). Enter the total in that parent's column on Line 15 and the total of both parents' expenses under the combined column on Line 15.\n\nLine 16. Each Parent's Obligation:\n\nMultiply the total additional payments (combined column on Line 15) by each parent's percentage share of income on Line 2, and enter each parent's dollar share of the additional payments on that parent's Line 16.\n\nLine 17. Amount Transferred:\n\nSubtract each parent's obligation for additional expenses (that parent's Line 16) from the total additional payments made by that parent (that parent's Line 15). The parent with a \"minus\" figure pays the other parent the amount on Line 17.\n\nPart 3 - Net Amount Transferred:\n\nLine 18. Combine Lines 11 and 17:\n\nCombine the amount owed by one parent to the other for basic support (Line 11) and the amount owed by one parent to the other for additional payments (Line 17). If the same parent owes for both obligations, add Lines 11 and 17, and enter the total on Line 18. If one parent owes for basic support and the other owes for additional payments, subtract the smaller amount from the larger and enter on Line 18. Fill in the blanks by stating which parent pays and which parent receives the net amount transferred.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 40-4-11.1, enacted by Laws 1988, ch. 87, § 2; 1991, ch. 206, § 1; 1995, ch. 142, § 1; 2008, ch. 48, § 1; 2021, ch. 20, § 1; 2023, ch. 106, § 1.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1991, ch. 206, § 4, effective June 14, 1991, repealed Laws 1988, ch. 87, § 4 which was to repeal 40-4-11.1 NMSA 1978 effective June 30, 1991.\n\nCross references.— For designation of health care authority department as the single state agency for the enforcement of child and spousal support obligations pursuant to Title IV D of the federal Social Security Act,see27-2-27 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor local district court rules and forms,seeLR2-Form J and LR11-114.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective January 1, 2024, removed the child support guideline schedule; required the human services department to update the child support tables by rule, defined \"department\" and \"schedule\"; in Subsection A, after \"as set forth in this section\", added \"and the child support schedule promulgated by the department\"; in Subsection F, added a new Paragraph F(1) and redesignated former Paragraphs F(1) through F(3) as Paragraphs F(2) through F(4), respectively, and added Paragraph F(5); in Subsection H, Paragraph H(1) and H(2), after \"basic child support schedule\", added \"promulgated by the department\"; and in Subsection M, deleted the child support guideline schedule and added \"The department shall\", and added Paragraphs M(1) and M(2).\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2023, ch. 106, § 5, provided that Laws 2023, ch. 106, apply to all decrees, judgments or orders of child support made on or after January 1, 2024.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2023, ch. 106, § 4, effective January 1, 2024, provided that the initial child support schedule established by the human services department [health care authority department] shall:\n\nA. not decrease the yearly basic support obligation for any level of combined parental income by more than the dollar change in the federal poverty guidelines for one person since 2018;\n\nB. not increase the yearly support obligation for any level of combined parental income by more than one and one-half times the change in the consumer price index since 2018. Any increase in support obligation that is larger than the increase in the consumer price index since 2018 must be specifically supported by economic data and evidence;\n\nC. not change the format of the child support schedule in a way that would be inconsistent with Worksheet A or Worksheet B in Subsection M of 40-4-11.1 NMSA 1978; and\n\nD. be promulgated, published and available to the public through the New Mexico Administrative Code, the New Mexico supreme court's website and the human services department's [health care authority department] website no later than January 1, 2024.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective July 1, 2021, required that any stipulation of child support that deviates from the guideline amount contain a statement of the reasons for the deviation, revised the definitions of \"income\" and \"gross income\" for purposes of the guidelines specified in this section, provided for the imputation of income, provided that incarceration may not be treated as voluntary unemployment, and completely rewrote the basic child support schedule; in Subsection A, after \"Every decree or judgment\", added \"or stipulation\"; in Subsection C, Paragraph C(1), deleted \"Income need not be imputed to the primary custodial parent actively caring for a child of the parties who is under the age of six or disabled. If income is imputed, a reasonable child care expense may be imputed\", and in Subparagraph C(2)(a), added item designation \"1)\", in Item C(2)(a)1), after \"programs\", added \"including, but not limited to, temporary assistance for needy families, supplemental security income and general assistance\", added Item C(2)(a)2), and item designation \"3)\", and in Subparagraph C(2)(e), after \"Subsection\", changed \"K\" to \"M\"; added new Subsections D and E and redesignated former Subsections D through J as Subsections F through L, respectively; after \"Subsection\", changed \"K\" to \"L\" throughout; deleted former Subsection K, which provided the basic child support schedule; and added Subsection M.\n\nThe 2008 amendment,effective May 14, 2008, changed the Basic Child Support Schedule in Subsection K by expanding the levels of combined gross monthly income and increasing the amount of child support.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, rewrote this section to the extent that a detailed comparison is impracticable.\n\nIncarceration affecting child support.— Support payments should accrue while father is incarcerated.Thomasson v. Johnson, 1995-NMCA-109, 120 N.M. 512, 903 P.2d 254.\n\nChild's income.— Under 40-4-11.1 NMSA 1978, child support is calculated based on the parents ' gross income. There is no provision in 40-4-11.1 NMSA 1978 for calculating basic child support based on the child's income. Rather, the child's income (whether from social security, his or her own earnings, from a trust established by grandparents or other sources) is relevant solely as a ground for deviating from the guidelines pursuant to 40-4-11.1 NMSA 1978.Pedersen v. Pedersen, 2000-NMCA-042, 129 N.M. 56, 1 P.3d 974.\n\nPrior children.— The use of \"prior children\" in the text of 40-4-11.1C(2)(d) NMSA 1978 controls over the use of \"other children\" in the instructions for Worksheet A. The phrase \"prior children\" refers to birth order and not to the timing of child support orders.Thompson v. Dehne, 2009-NMCA-120, 147 N.M. 283, 220 P.3d 1132.\n\nCalculation of child support where there are other children.— In a child support proceeding to obtain a support order for the second of defendant's three children, where each of defendant's three children had a different mother and support orders had been entered for defendant's first child and third child before petitioner filed a petition for a support order for the second child, the proper calculation of the second child's support should have been determined by deducing only the amount of the first child's support from defendant's income and not the amount of the third child's support.Thompson v. Dehne, 2009-NMCA-120, 147 N.M. 283, 220 P.3d 1132.\n\nGarnishment statute is inapplicable to the calculation of child support.— The garnishment statute, 35-12-7 NMSA 1978, which provides that the maximum amount which may be taken from wages for the enforcement of child support is fifty percent of disposable income, is inapplicable to calculating the amount of child support.Thompson v. Dehne, 2009-NMCA-120, 147 N.M. 283, 220 P.3d 1132.\n\nRequirement for use of Worksheet B.— Since the non-physical custodial parent had visitation with the child more than 30% of the time, the court was required to use Worksheet B in calculating child support.Gomez v. Gomez, 1995-NMCA-049, 119 N.M. 755, 895 P.2d 277, superseded by statute,Erickson v. Erickson, 1999-NMCA-056, 127 N.M. 140, 978 P.2d 347.\n\nRecreational and educational and travel expensesare included within the basic child support provided by the child support guidelines.Klinksiek v. Klinksiek, 2005-NMCA-008, 136 N.M. 693, 104 P.3d 559.\n\nMedical coverage alone not \"child support.\"— Child support obligation was not met merely by father's provision of medical insurance for child, where such coverage was required by the Mandatory Medical Support Act, 40-4C-2 NMSA 1978, and was in addition to, not in lieu of, father's support obligations under the child support guidelines.Sisneroz v. Polanco, 1999-NMCA-039, 126 N.M. 779, 975 P.2d 392.\n\nRight to child support arrearages.— Mother's silence and conduct in accepting the unilaterally reduced child support payments, without more, was insufficient to support a finding of waiver of her right to child support arrearages as provided in the divorce decree; nor was such evidence sufficient to support a finding of acquiescence.McCurry v. McCurry, 1994-NMCA-047, 117 N.M. 564, 874 P.2d 25.\n\nCustody neither \"basic visitation\" nor \"shared responsibility.\"— Where one of two children of divorced parents lived 59% of the time with his father and 41% of his time with his mother and the other lived 71% of her time with her mother and 29% with her father, child support should have been computed, first, for the daughter, by treating her as the sole child in a basic visitation arrangement, then, for the son, by treating him as a child for whom father and mother had shared responsibility, adjusting the calculation to take into account that he is the sole child housed by father and the second child housed by mother.Erickson v. Erickson, 1999-NMCA-056, 127 N.M. 140, 978 P.2d 347.\n\nIncome considerations.— Income under Subsection C includes \"income from any source\" and can include interest or trust income and as such the trial court was entitled to consider potential as well as actual, present income and could examine any such assets that could produce such income.Talley v. Talley, 1993-NMCA-003, 115 N.M. 89, 847 P.2d 323.\n\nBy limiting its determination of the father's gross monthly income to his tax returns, the trial court was too strict in defining what it believed was income, and it erred in not considering other sources of revenue, including cash savings, yearly interest, IRA's and land purchases.Padilla v. Montano, 1993-NMCA-127, 116 N.M. 398, 862 P.2d 1257.\n\nTrial court properly included income from an individual retirement account in its calculations of a parent's child support obligation; the fact that the parent would have to pay a penalty for withdrawing the money from the individual retirement account prior to reaching the age of retirement did not render the money unavailable for child support, under this section.Quintana v. Eddins, 2002-NMCA-008, 131 N.M. 435, 38 P.3d 203.\n\nUse of the father's dividend earnings in the year prior to the year in question was error where it was shown that his dividend investments changed from year-to-year.Boutz v. Donaldson, 1999-NMCA-131, 128 N.M. 232, 991 P.2d 517.\n\nEven though the father, a writer, was not engaged in writing and had no income from current literary efforts during the year in question, the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to deduct a sum for fixed overhead expenses from his earnings from previous writings during that year.Boutz v. Donaldson, 1999-NMCA-131, 128 N.M. 232, 991 P.2d 517.\n\nUnder Subsection C(1), the court should have imputed income from full-time employment to the mother even though she did not work full-time during the marriage.Styka v. Styka, 1999-NMCA-002, 126 N.M. 515, 972 P.2d 16, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 534, 972 P.2d 353 (1998).\n\nAs long as a parent was working full time in his or her area of expertise, earning an income within the range presented by the evidence and in a location reasonably accessible to his or her child, a trial court could not make finding of underemployment without also finding bad faith; to do otherwise would put a parent in the untenable position of choosing between playing an active role in the child's upbringing and leaving to earn enough money to meet the support obligation.Quintana v. Eddins, 2002-NMCA-008, 131 N.M. 435, 38 P.3d 203.\n\nThe trial court was within its discretion not to consider the mother underemployed by virtue of her reasonable, yet unsuccessful, efforts to establish a profitable business, and reasonable efforts to provide a home for her children.Boutz v. Donaldson, 1999-NMCA-131, 128 N.M. 232, 991 P.2d 517.\n\nThe language of Subsection C(2) requires consideration of the actual amount of income from the sources listed therein in the determination of each parent's gross income.Styka v. Styka, 1999-NMCA-002, 126 N.M. 515, 972 P.2d 16, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 534, 972 P.2d 353 (1998).\n\nInterest earned on cash assets received in a property distribution is income for purposes of child support and the determination of income includes the income potential of idle assets.Styka v. Styka, 1999-NMCA-002, 126 N.M. 515, 972 P.2d 16, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 534, 972 P.2d 353 (1998).\n\nWhere a father failed to obtain full-time employment or attempt to regain his law license, a district court properly imputed income against him for child support purposes based on his underemployment; however, the amount imputed was not supported by sufficient evidence because there was no showing that the father could have secured employment at the salary he made at his last job.State ex rel. Human Servs. Dep't v. Kelley, 2003-NMCA-050, 133 N.M. 510, 64 P.3d 537.\n\nPast lifestyle of children.— Past status may provide probative evidence about the likelihood of future status. There was no error in the trial court's consideration of the children's past lifestyle to assess the fairness of the support award.Roberts v. Wright, 1994-NMCA-022, 117 N.M. 294, 871 P.2d 390.\n\nBusiness expenses of closely-held corporation.— While the trial court may consider the tax treatment of business expenses claimed by a parent as \"ordinary and necessary,\" the trial court is not limited to the tax treatment of a particular expense. The parent claiming a business expense must show not only that it is ordinary and necessary to the business, but also that it is irrelevant to calculating support obligations. For example, business expenses that are valid for accounting or tax purposes may not affect a parent's actual cash flow, so they would normally not be considered ordinary and necessary for purposes of calculating support.Roberts v. Wright, 1994-NMCA-022, 117 N.M. 294, 871 P.2d 390;Jurado v. Jurado, 1995-NMCA-014, 119 N.M. 522, 892 P.2d 969.\n\nRent payments.— Pursuant to the plain language of Subsection C(2)(b) of this section, the rent payments wife received from tenant constitute \"gross receipts\" in calculating her \"gross income\".Klinksiek v. Klinksiek, 2005-NMCA-008, 136 N.M. 693, 104 P.3d 559.\n\nWife is entitled to deduct from the \"gross receipts\"the \"ordinary and necessary expenses\" required to produce the rental income to determine her \"gross income\" from the rent.Klinksiek v. Klinksiek, 2005-NMCA-008, 136 N.M. 693, 104 P.3d 559.\n\nNot considered income.— The term \"in-kind benefits\" in Subsection C(2) refers to employment benefits and does not apply to a residence in which the mother was living without cost.Styka v. Styka, 1999-NMCA-002, 126 N.M. 515, 972 P.2d 16, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 534, 972 P.2d 353 (1998).\n\nMonthly payments of capital not income.— Monthly payments on a real estate contract that constitutes return of capital is not income.Leeder v. Leeder, 1994-NMCA-105, 118 N.M. 603, 884 P.2d 494.\n\nGifts.— Under Subsection C(2), gross income generally does not include gifts; however, deviation from the child support guidelines as authorized under Subsection A could include the calculation of periodic dependable gifts.Styka v. Styka, 1999-NMCA-002, 126 N.M. 515, 972 P.2d 16, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 534, 972 P.2d 353 (1998).\n\nAttorney fees properly awarded.— The trial court's determination of attorney fees was proper where the length of the marriage, husband's substantial separate assets, and wife's lack of out-of-home working experience all supported its decision.Talley v. Talley, 1993-NMCA-003, 115 N.M. 89, 847 P.2d 323.\n\nChanged circumstances required for modification of support.— The legislature intended 40-4-11.1 NMSA 1978 to update and make uniform throughout the state the amount of the child support obligation based on the income of the parents, but did not intend to abolish the requirement that the party seeking modification make the traditional showing of a substantial change in circumstances, harmonizing 40-4-11.1 with 40-4-7 NMSA 1978 and giving effect to both.Perkins v. Rowson, 1990-NMCA-089, 110 N.M. 671, 798 P.2d 1057, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 641, 798 P.2d 591.\n\nCourt order required for modification of undivided award.— Where a modification award provided one amount for \"child support for the two minor children,\" and did not contain language expressly or even impliedly allowing an automatic reduction when the older child turned 18, relief could only have been obtained in court.Bustos v. Bustos, 2000-NMCA-040, 128 N.M. 842, 999 P.2d 1074.\n\nCosts to be considered.— Under Subsection H, the trial court is required to include child-care costs in its computations.Styka v. Styka, 1999-NMCA-002, 126 N.M. 515, 972 P.2d 16, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 534, 972 P.2d 353 (1998).\n\nTrial court did not err in including the costs of private school in child support calculations.Styka v. Styka, 1999-NMCA-002, 126 N.M. 515, 972 P.2d 16, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 534, 972 P.2d 353 (1998).\n\nChild-care costs incurred while attending college.— Child-care costs paid by the mother while she attended college in pursuit of a college degree were incurred \"due to employment or job search\" for the purpose of calculating child support obligations under Subsection G.Alverson v. Harris, 1997-NMCA-024, 123 N.M. 153, 935 P.2d 1165.\n\nDeviations from support guidelines.— Trial court erred in departing from the statutory child support guidelines without first determining the amount due under the guidelines, in failing to clearly indicate how it arrived at its award, and in failing to explain its deviations from the guidelines.Tedford v. Gregory, 1998-NMCA-067, 125 N.M. 206, 959 P.2d 540, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 147, 958 P.2d 105.\n\nAnnual abatement of child support is not deviation from guidelines but such deviations are explicitly provided for in those guidelines by Subsection A.Grant v. Cumiford, 2005-NMCA-058, 137 N.M. 485, 112 P.3d 1142.\n\nDeviation from child support guidelines.— It is error to deviate from the child support guidelines in calculating the parties' gross incomes except as authorized by statute or appellate case law, and it is also error to deviate from the child support guidelines in any manner without providing written justification for such deviation.Jury v. Jury, 2017-NMCA-036.\n\nWhere petitioner appealed the district court's denial of her motion to modify a 2010 child support decree, claiming that the district court's ruling resulted from its erroneous determination of the parties' gross monthly incomes and, by extension, child support obligations, reversal and remand for recalculation of the parties' gross monthly incomes was necessary to the extent that the district court improperly deviated from the child support guidelines in calculating the parties' gross monthly incomes and failed to specify the reasons for its decision in deviating from the child support guidelines.Jury v. Jury, 2017-NMCA-036.\n\nDeviation from presumption.— The child support guidelines allow wife to make a proper showing that there should be a deviation from the presumptive amount of her gross income.Klinksiek v. Klinksiek, 2005-NMCA-008, 136 N.M. 693, 104 P.3d 559.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Positive Parenting and Negative Contributions: Why Payment of Child Support Should Not Be Regarded as Dissipation of Marital Assets,\" see 30 N.M.L.

A finding that rebuts the child support guidelines and basic child support schedule shall state the amount of support that would have been required under the guidelines and basic child support schedule and the justification of why the order varies from the guidelines and the basic child support schedule. Circumstances creating a substantial hardship in the obligor, obligee or subject children may justify a deviation upward or downward from the amount that would otherwise be payable under the guidelines and basic child support schedule.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 40-4-11.2, enacted by Laws 1989, ch. 36, § 1; 2021, ch. 20, § 2; 2023, ch. 106, § 2.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective January 1, 2024, added references to the basic child support schedule that the human services department is required to update by rule; and after \"Any deviation from the child support\", deleted \"guideline amounts\" and added \"guidelines\", after \"Section 40-4-11.1 NMSA 1978\", added \"and the basic child support schedule promulgated by the human services department\", and after each occurrence of \"guidelines\", added \"and basic child support schedule\" throughout the section.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2023, ch. 106, § 5, provided that Laws 2023, ch. 106, apply to all decrees, judgments or orders of child support made on or after January 1, 2024.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2023, ch. 106, § 4, effective January 1, 2024, provided that the initial child support schedule established by the human services department [health care authority department] shall:\n\nA. not decrease the yearly basic support obligation for any level of combined parental income by more than the dollar change in the federal poverty guidelines for one person since 2018;\n\nB. not increase the yearly support obligation for any level of combined parental income by more than one and one-half times the change in the consumer price index since 2018. Any increase in support obligation that is larger than the increase in the consumer price index since 2018 must be specifically supported by economic data and evidence;\n\nC. not change the format of the child support schedule in a way that would be inconsistent with Worksheet A or Worksheet B in Subsection M of 40-4-11.1 NMSA 1978; and\n\nD. be promulgated, published and available to the public through the New Mexico Administrative Code, the New Mexico supreme court's website and the human services department's [health care authority department] website no later than January 1, 2024.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective July 1, 2021, required that a written finding that application of the child support guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate to state the amount of support that would have been required under the guidelines and the justification for the deviation from the guidelines; and added \"A finding that rebuts the child support guidelines shall state the amount of support that would have been required under the guidelines and the justification of why the order varies from the guidelines\".\n\nDeviation from the child support guidelines.- It is error to deviate from the child support guidelines in calculating the parties' gross incomes except as authorized by statute or appellate case law, and it is also error to deviate from the child support guidelines in any manner without providing written justification for such deviation.Jury v. Jury, 2017-NMCA-036.\n\nWhere petitioner appealed the district court's denial of her motion to modify a 2010 child support decree that resulted from the dissolution of the marriage between petitioner and respondent, claiming that the district court's ruling resulted from its erroneous determination of the parties' gross monthly incomes and, by extension, child support obligations, reversal and remand for recalculation of the parties' gross monthly incomes was necessary to the extent that the district court improperly deviated from the child support guidelines in calculating the parties' gross monthly incomes and failed to specify the reasons for its decision in deviating from the child support guidelines.Jury v. Jury, 2017-NMCA-036.\n\nChild's income.— In allowing a credit against basic child support for off-schedule sources of income, such as social security benefits paid directly to the child, this section requires the trial court to exercise its discretion on a case-by-case basis, with the child's standard of living a crucial factor.Pederson v. Pederson, 2000-NMCA-042, 129 N.M. 56, 1 P.3d 974.\n\nDeduction of guardian fees from child support.— Guardian ad litem fees may not be deducted from child support.Grant v.

A court may modify a child support obligation upon a showing of material and substantial changes in circumstances subsequent to the adjudication of the pre-existing order, including the health care needs of a child, to include the availability of health care coverage. There shall be a presumption of material and substantial changes in circumstances if application of the child support guidelines in Section 40-4-11.1 NMSA 1978 would result in a deviation upward or downward of more than twenty percent of the existing child support obligation and the petition for modification is filed more than one year after the filing of the pre-existing order.\n\nB. All child support orders shall contain a provision for the annual exchange of financial information by the obligor and obligee upon a written request by either party. The financial information to be furnished shall include:\n\n(1) federal and state tax returns, including all schedules, for the year preceding the request;\n\n(2) W-2 statements for the year preceding the request;\n\n(3) Internal Revenue Service Form 1099s for the year preceding the request;\n\n(4) work-related daycare statements for the year preceding the request;\n\n(5) dependent medical insurance premiums for the year preceding the request; and\n\n(6) wage and payroll statements for four months preceding the request.\n\nFor the purposes of this subsection, the wages of a subsequent spouse may be omitted from the financial information provided by either the obligor or the obligee.\n\nC. The requirement to provide for the child's health care needs in the order, through insurance or other means, shall be a basis to initiate an adjustment of an order, regardless of whether an adjustment in the amount of child support is necessary.\n\nHistory:Laws 1990, ch. 58, § 1; 1991, ch. 206, § 2; 2021, ch. 20, § 4.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective July 1, 2021, provided that the health care needs of a minor child are an adequate basis for modification of a child support order; in Subsection A, after \"pre-existing order\", added \"including the health care needs of a child, to include the availability of health care coverage\"; and added Subsection C.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, rewrote this section to the extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nCases in which there is a presumption of material and substantial changes in circumstances.— In cases in which application of the parties' updated financial information to the child support guidelines results in a deviation upward or downward of more than twenty percent of the existing child support obligation, the party seeking modification is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of material and substantial changes in circumstances justifying a modification.Jury v.

In carrying out its duties under this section, the secretary of human services, or the secretary's authorized representative, has the power to issue subpoenas:\n\n(1) to compel the attendance of the obligor or the obligee at a hearing on the child support order;\n\n(2) to compel production by the obligor or the obligee of financial or wage information, including federal or state tax returns;\n\n(3) to compel the obligor or the obligee to disclose the location of employment of the payor party; and\n\n(4) to compel the employer of the obligor or the obligee to disclose information relating to the employee's wages.\n\nC. A subpoena issued by the human services department [health care authority department] under this section shall state with reasonable certainty the nature of the information required, the time and place where the information shall be produced, whether the subpoena requires the attendance of the person subpoenaed or only the production of information and records and the consequences of failure to obey the subpoena.\n\nD. A subpoena issued by the human services department [health care authority department] under this section shall be served upon the person to be subpoenaed or, at the option of the secretary or the secretary's authorized representative, by certified mail addressed to the person at his last known address.

The right to seek modification shall rest with the department in the case of obligations being enforced as a result of a public assistance recipient's assignment of support rights to the state as provided in the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 602(a)(26).\n\nF. At the request of the obligor or the obligee or upon the filing of a motion to modify child support, the human services department [health care authority department] shall furnish any information it has obtained in its review process regarding wages or other information pertaining to the obligor or the obligee.\n\nG.

      "text": "A. In case a sum of money is allowed to the children by the decree for the support, education or maintenance of the children, the decree shall become a lien on the real and personal property of the obligor party from the date of filing of a notice of order or decree in the office of the county clerk of each county where any of the property may be situated.\n\nB. The notice of order or decree shall contain:\n\n(1) the caption of the case from which the duty of child support arose, including the state, county and court in which the case was heard, the case number and the names of the parties when the case was heard;\n\n(2) the date of entry of the judgment, order or decree from which the duty of child support arose;\n\n(3) the current names and years of birth of the parties; and\n\n(4) each party's last known address, unless ordered otherwise in the judgment, order or decree from which the duty of child support arose.\n\nC. The notice shall be executed and acknowledged in the same manner as a grant of land is executed and acknowledged.\n\nD.

Henderson, 18 Bankr. 663 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1982).\n\nClaim for child support may be prosecuted against deceased father's estate.— Where a father has been ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction to make child support payments until his child reaches majority in accord with a stipulation made by parents and present in decree, and thereafter the father dies while the child is yet a minor, a claim may be successfully prosecuted in the probate court against the estate of the father to enforce the payment.Hill v.

Romero, 1984-NMCA-049, 101 N.M. 345, 682 P.2d 201.\n\nChild support payments are final judgments when due.— Accrued and unpaid periodic child support installments mandated in a divorce decree are each considered final judgments on the date they become due.Britton v. Britton, 1983-NMSC-084, 100 N.M. 424, 671 P.2d 1135.\n\nSupport installments becoming due as absolute and vested right.— Where a decree is rendered for alimony and is made payable in future installments the right to such installments becomes absolute and vested upon becoming due, and is therefore protected by the full faith and credit clause, unless by the law of the state in which a judgment for future alimony was rendered the right to demand and receive such future alimony is discretionary with the court which rendered the decree, to such an extent that no absolute or vested right attaches to receive installments ordered by the decree to be paid. This principle has also been applied to child support.Corliss v. Corliss, 1976-NMSC-023, 89 N.M. 235, 549 P.2d 1070.\n\nStatute of limitations.— Because each monthly child support installment mandated in the final decree is a final judgment, the statute of limitations period found in 37-1-2 NMSA 1978 applies.Britton v. Britton, 1983-NMSC-084, 100 N.M. 424, 671 P.2d 1135.\n\nExecution obtainable without reducing arrearages to judgment.— A creditor spouse may obtain a writ of execution based on a decree for child support without reducing the arrearages to judgment.Gonzalez v. Gonzalez, 1985-NMCA-071, 103 N.M. 157, 703 P.2d 934.\n\nInability to pay is a good defense in contempt proceedingfor noncompliance with an in personam order to pay community debts, but the burden of proving the defense rests upon him who asserts it.Nelson v. Nelson, 1971-NMSC-027, 82 N.M. 324, 481 P.2d 403.\n\nCourt's discretion where counterclaim in form of contempt action.— In a suit for a money judgment very little discretion is allowed, the court merely examining the validity of the prior judgment and entering a money judgment, but since the wife counterclaimed against the husband in his change of custody action in the form of a contempt action, as opposed to seeking a money judgment for arrearages, her action invoked the equitable powers of the court in which the trial court has discretion to fashion an installment payment plan of the husband's debt of child support and alimony arrearages.Corliss v. Corliss, 1976-NMSC-023, 89 N.M. 235, 549 P.2d 1070.\n\nPerson subject to pay dischargeable debt not subject to contempt power.— A person subject to an in personam order to pay a dischargeable debt is not subject to the trial court's contempt power, for to hold otherwise would circumvent the policy behind allowing bankruptcies.Sosaya v. Sosaya, 1977-NMSC-001, 89 N.M. 769, 558 P.2d 38.\n\nImprisonment for failure to pay alimony or child supportrests with the discretion of the trial court, which should use the power of contempt cautiously and sparingly, and the least possible power adequate to compel compliance with the court's order is its proper exercise.Corliss v. Corliss, 1976-NMSC-023, 89 N.M. 235, 549 P.2d 1070.\n\nCourt obliged to give full force and effect to accrued support.— Since New Mexico gives Missouri divorce decrees full faith and credit, the trial court was obliged to give full force and effect to accrued alimony and child support due under a Missouri decree. The Missouri court granting the divorce had no power to modify accrued alimony and child support, and therefore, the district court in New Mexico had no such power either.Corliss v.

Johnstone, 2011-NMCA-045, 149 N.M. 605, 252 P.3d 829.\n\nWhere petitioner filed a petition for legal separation, division of property and spousal support; while the action was pending and before entry of a final decree, respondent died; and petitioner filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the action, 40-4-20 NMSA 1978 did not preclude the district court from granting the motion to dismiss the action.Trinosky v. Johnstone, 2011-NMCA-045, 149 N.M. 605, 252 P.3d 829.\n\nThe four-year statute of limitations of 37-1-4 NMSA 1978 does not applyto a division of undivided retirement benefits.Gilmore v. Gilmore, 2010-NMCA-013, 147 N.M. 625, 227 P.3d 115.\n\nSubject matter jurisdiction.— Where defendant filed a divorce action against plaintiff in New Mexico; plaintiff obtained a default divorce in California; defendant's New Mexico divorce action was dismissed when the California divorce was granted; the California court initially issued a qualified domestic relations order awarding plaintiff a portion of defendant's retirement benefits; the California court subsequently set aside the qualified domestic relations order for lack of personal jurisdiction; and plaintiff then filed an action in New Mexico for division of the retirement benefits, the retirement benefits were an undivided asset, plaintiff's New Mexico action was an independent action, and the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to divide the retirement benefits.Gilmore v. Gilmore, 2010-NMCA-013, 147 N.M. 625, 227 P.3d 115.\n\nDivision of retirement benefits.— Where plaintiff filed an action to divide defendant's monthly retirement benefits; defendant offered to buy out plaintiff's share of the retirement benefits through a lump-sum payment; and defendant did not have the ability to pay a lump sum at the time of the hearing on plaintiff's petition, the district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding plaintiff a share of the retirement benefits under a pay-as-it-comes-in method.Gilmore v. Gilmore, 2010-NMCA-013, 147 N.M. 625, 227 P.3d 115.\n\nLaches, equitable estoppel and waiver by acquiescence.— Where a California court granted plaintiff a default divorce from defendant in 1994; defendant retired and began receiving monthly retirement benefits in 2005; the California court issued a qualified domestic relations order awarding plaintiff a portion of defendant's retirement benefits in 2006; the California court set aside the qualified domestic relations order in 2006 for lack of personal jurisdiction; plaintiff filed an action in New Mexico in 2007 for a division of the retirement benefits; defendant testified that plaintiff told defendant that plaintiff did not want any money from defendant's retirement, that defendant relied on plaintiff's statement and paid defendant's subsequent wife a lump sum payment for her share of defendant's retirement, and that defendant was forced to select a retirement option of maximum monthly payments because plaintiff failed to perfect plaintiff's claim; and plaintiff testified that plaintiff asserted plaintiff's rights as soon as defendant retired, plaintiff rejected defendant's settlement offers; and plaintiff never waived plaintiff's right to defendant's retirement benefits, there was sufficient evidence to support the district court's denial of defendant's defenses of laches, equitable estoppel and waiver by acquiescence.Gilmore v. Gilmore, 2010-NMCA-013, 147 N.M. 625, 227 P.3d 115.\n\nMethod for division of retirement benefits.— Absent an agreement regarding calculation of benefits, there is no set rule for determining every case involving the division of retirement benefits.Gilmore v. Gilmore, 2010-NMCA-013, 147 N.M. 625, 227 P.3d 115.\n\nUse of time-rule method.— Where plaintiff and defendant were married for nine years during which time plaintiff was a municipal police officer; plaintiff and defendant were divorced in 1994; the divorce decree did not provide for the division of defendant's retirement benefits; after the divorce, defendant was employed as an undersheriff and later as the director of a county detention center; defendant's salaries as undersheriff and as director of the county detention center were significantly more than defendant's salary as a municipal police officer; defendant retired and began receiving monthly retirement benefits in 2005; and plaintiff filed an action in 2006 for division of the retirement benefits, the district court erred in assuming that the public employees retirement association required the use of the time-rule method to calculate plaintiff's share of defendant's retirement benefits.Gilmore v. Gilmore, 2010-NMCA-013, 147 N.M. 625, 227 P.3d 115.\n\nProcedure when death occurs during dissolution.— A decedent's will and trust are not statutorily revoked by the entry of a 40-4-20B NMSA 1978 marital property judgment. Before the domestic relations proceedings can be continued, a personal representative who is not disqualified by a conflict of interest must be appointed to represent the decedent's estate through the conclusion of those proceedings. After the domestic relations court concludes the 40-4-20B NMSA 1978 proceedings, the decedent's estate can be distributed according to the decedent's estate plan and governing probate statutes.Oldham v. Oldham, 2011-NMSC-007, 149 N.M. 215, 247 P.3d 736,rev'g in partandaff'g in part, 2009-NMCA-126, 147 N.M. 329, 222 P.3d 701.\n\nAppointment of decedent's spouse as personal representative of decedent's estate.— Where decedent executed a will designating decedent's spouse as the personal representative and beneficiary of decedent's estate; decedent subsequently filed a petition for divorce; and decedent died while the divorce proceeding was pending, the court erred in appointing decedent's spouse as personal representative of decedent's estate because the appointment of decedent's spouse as personal representative to represent decedent's estate against the spouse in the pending divorce proceeding created an inherent conflict of interest.Oldham v. Oldham, 2009-NMCA-126, 147 N.M. 329, 222 P.3d 701,rev'd in partandaff'd in part byOldham v. Oldham, 2011-NMSC-007, 149 N.M. 215, 247 P.3d 736.\n\nDeath of a spouse during a divorce proceeding.— If one spouse dies during the pendency of a divorce proceeding, marital property and debt covered by this section are divided and distributed according to New Mexico domestic relations law, debt incurred after the death of the decedent spouse is separate debt to be dealt with through probate, and the surviving spouse is not the surviving spouse for purposes of probate.Karpien v. Karpien, 2009-NMCA-043, 146 N.M. 188, 207 P.3d 1165.\n\nSpousal support and attorney fees awarded after death of spouse.— In a divorce proceeding continued after the death of a spouse pursuant to 40-4-20 NMSA 1978 in which the court awards lump-sum spousal support and attorney fees, the final judgment is not a claim against the estate of the deceased spouse for purposes of the [Uniform] Probate Code's (Chapter 45 NMSA 1978) creditor's claims provisions of 45-3-805 NMSA 1978.Estate of Nauert v. Morgan-Nauret, 2012-NMCA-037, 274 P.3d 799.\n\nWhere the deceased spouse who filed for divorce in March 2006; died while the divorce action was pending; in September 2007, the probate court appointed a personal representative of the estate; in November 2007, the divorce court awarded the surviving spouse monthly spousal support from September 2007 and attorney fees and ordered the estate to pay the awards immediately; and the personal representative claimed that the awards were class six claims under 45-3-805 NMSA 1978, the awards were not claims under the [Uniform] Probate Code (Chapter 45 NMSA 1978) to which the creditors' claims provisions of Section 45-3-805 NMSA 1978 applied.Estate of Nauert v. Morgan-Nauret, 2012-NMCA-037, 274 P.3d 799.\n\nSpousal support and attorney fees awarded after death of spouse did not violate Federal Insolvency Act.— Where a divorce proceeding was continued after the death of a spouse and the divorce court ordered the deceased spouse's estate to immediately pay a lump-sum amount for spousal support and attorney fees to the surviving spouse, the award did not violate the Federal Insolvency Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3713(a)(1)(B) which requires claims of the United States government to be paid first when the estate of the deceased debtor is not enough to pay all debts of the debtor, because the divorce court awards were not claims against the estate of the deceased spouse and the act did not apply.Estate of Nauert v. Morgan-Nauret, 2012-NMCA-037, 274 P.3d 799.\n\nProperty divided pursuant to this sectionmust be divided in an independent action.Lewis v. Lewis, 1987-NMCA-073, 106 N.M. 105, 739 P.2d 974.\n\nDivorce decree not bar to set aside action where property rights not litigated.— Where neither the property rights of the parties nor the validity of the conveyance of the property was litigated in the divorce proceeding, the divorce decree is not a bar to the wife's independent action to set aside her conveyance of community property.Trujillo v. Padilla, 1968-NMSC-090, 79 N.M. 245, 442 P.2d 203.\n\nIf property rights are not considered or disposed of in divorceaction, a suit seeking division and distribution of the property may be subsequently prosecuted.Zarges v. Zarges, 1968-NMSC-151, 79 N.M. 494, 445 P.2d 97.\n\nPetition not barred by res judicata.— A petition to divide a previously undivided asset involves a new cause of action not barred by res judicata.Pacheco v. Quintana, 1986-NMCA-007, 105 N.M. 139, 730 P.2d 1, cert. quashed, 105 N.M. 94, 728 P.2d 845.\n\nFour-year statute of limitations of 37-1-4 NMSA 1978applies to suits to divide personal property brought under this section.Plaatje v. Plaatje, 1981-NMSC-040, 95 N.M. 789, 626 P.2d 1286.\n\nProperty no longer community property after divorce.— After divorce the parties are no longer husband and wife, and the property is no longer community property and former 57-4-3, 1953 Comp., relating to management and conveyance, has no application.Jones v. Tate, 1961-NMSC-039, 68 N.M. 258, 360 P.2d 920.\n\nUpon divorce of parties all community property not dividedbetween them does not remain community property but becomes property which they hold as tenants in common.Jones v. Tate, 1961-NMSC-039, 68 N.M. 258, 360 P.2d 920; Martinez v. Martinez, 2004-NMCA-007, 135 N.M. 11, 83 P.3d 298.\n\nStatute of limitations does not apply to action for accounting and partition of real property.— There is nothing about the bare holding of title that should equate to the accrual of a cause of action that triggers a time limitation on the right to seek partition; thus, the trial court must analyze a post-divorce action to partition real property in the same fashion as any partition action by a tenant in common.Martinez v. Martinez, 2004-NMCA-007, 135 N.M. 11, 83 P.3d 298.\n\nIf rights were community property prior to divorce,such rights, after divorce, are owned as tenants in common.Hickson v. Herrmann, 1967-NMSC-083, 77 N.M. 683, 427 P.2d 36.\n\nExisting present interest of wife continues even after divorce.— This section recognizes an existing present interest of the wife in the community property during the existence of the matrimonial status, which continues even after divorce, where the property is not divided in the decree in the divorce case.In re Miller's Estate, 1940-NMSC-021, 44 N.M. 214, 100 P.2d 908; Beals v. Ares, 1919-NMSC-067, 25 N.M. 459, 185 P. 780.\n\nWife's interest in community property not affected by adultery.Beals v. Ares, 1919-NMSC-067, 25 N.M. 459, 185 P. 780.\n\nSpouses' equal interest as tenants-in-common in insurance policy.— Unless otherwise ordered by the court in the dissolution of marriage and the property settlement, the divorced spouses have an equal interest as tenants in common in a term life insurance policy until such time as the term determined by the last premium paid by community funds comes to an end.Phillips v. Wellborn, 1976-NMSC-038, 89 N.M. 340, 552 P.2d 471.\n\nWhere right to policy proceeds obtained during marriage.— Where there is an insured third person (the child) and a spouse (the defendant) as beneficiary and the proceeds were not paid during marriage, but the right to the proceeds was obtained during marriage, this right was not changed and was not divided upon the divorce.Hickson v. Herrmann, 1967-NMSC-083, 77 N.M. 683, 427 P.2d 36.\n\nSince husband owned right to receive proceeds of policy as community propertyof the parties, this right, not having been disposed of by divorce, became the right of the parties as tenants in common.Hickson v. Herrmann, 1967-NMSC-083, 77 N.M. 683, 427 P.2d 36.\n\nInterest in pension plan need not be vested for division.— A spouse's entitlement to half of the community interest in a pension plan earned during coverture does not rest upon whether the employee's interest was vested at the time of divorce, but whether the worker's rights in the pension constitute a property interest or right obtained with community funds or labor.Berry v. Meadows, 1986-NMCA-002, 103 N.M. 761, 713 P.2d 1017.\n\nPost-decree retirement benefit plan increases.— The community pension and profit-sharing plans maintained by the husband became a tenancy in common interest with the entry of the partial decree of divorce dissolving the parties' marriage, and since when two parties hold personal or real property as tenants in common, they each have a separate and distinct interest in the property that cannot legally be transferred or extinguished by the other co-tenant, and since the retirement benefit plan increases from the date of the partial decree were the result of passive earnings and appreciation, any increases should be shared equally at the time of the judgment dividing the parties' property, and therefore according to the parties' percentage of ownership as of the date of the latter judgment.Lewis v. Lewis, 1987-NMCA-073, 106 N.M. 105, 739 P.2d 974.\n\nFuture tax consequences of deferred pension paymentsare too speculative and should be disregarded in calculating the present value of the pensions.Lewis v. Lewis, 1987-NMCA-073, 106 N.M. 105, 739 P.2d 974.\n\nDivision of military benefits governed by jurisdiction granting alimony.— Trial court was without authority to award respondent part of petitioner's military benefits, whether as a modification of the original Colorado divorce and alimony decree or as a separate action under this section, where such benefits were not recognized under Colorado law as marital assets.Reyes v. Reyes, 1987-NMCA-007, 105 N.M. 383, 733 P.2d 14, cert. deniedsub nom. Reyes v. State, 105 N.M. 358, 732 P.2d 1381 (1987).\n\nPost-decree claim for military retirement benefits.— Where there was no substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding that the parties orally agreed that the husband should be awarded the entire community interest in his military retirement benefits, the wife was not precluded from asserting her post-decree claim for this undistributed asset.Berry v. Meadows, 1986-NMCA-002, 103 N.M. 761, 713 P.2d 1017.\n\nMilitary retirement benefits are a form of employee compensationand are community property if the period of employment upon which those benefits are based occurred during coverture. Although the right to receive benefits matured prior to divorce, the right to receive each monthly installment accrues when the installment becomes due. Thus the statutory time limitation upon a former spouse's right to sue for a portion of each installment commences to run from the time each installment comes due.Plaatje v. Plaatje, 1981-NMSC-040, 95 N.M. 789, 626 P.2d 1286.\n\nApplicability of USFSPA to pre-1981 divorce decrees.— The provisions of Paragraph 1408(c)(1) of the federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. § 1408(c)(1), do not entitle a non-military spouse to a share of the military spouse's pension, where the divorce decree was decided prior to June 25, 1981, and where such decree did not treat the pension as marital property or reserve jurisdiction to make such determination at a later date.Hennessy v. Duryea, 1998-NMCA-036, 124 N.M. 754, 955 P.2d 683, cert. denied, 124 N.M. 589, 953 P.2d 1087.\n\nFederal preemption.— The purpose of Paragraph 1408(c)(1) of the federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. § 1408(c)(1), is to preempt state laws that allow reopening of divorce decrees that were silent as to military retirement pay; to the extent that Subsection A of this section is inconsistent with such purpose, Subsection A of this section is preempted.Hennessy v. Duryea, 1998-NMCA-036, 124 N.M. 754, 955 P.2d 683, cert. denied, 124 N.M. 589, 953 P.2d 1087.\n\nFederal preemption regarding military disability retirement benefits.— United States Supreme Court decision inMansell v. Mansell, 490 U.S. 581, 109 S. Ct. 2023, 104 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1989), holding that states were preempted by federal statute from treating military disability retirement benefits as community property, would not be applied retroactively.Toupal v. Toupal, 1990-NMCA-027, 109 N.M. 774, 790 P.2d 1055, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 751, 790 P.2d 1032, and cert. denied, 498 U.S. 982, 111 S. Ct. 513, 112 L. Ed. 2d 525 (1990).\n\nNew action to modify property division.— Even though the court which entered the original divorce decree no longer had jurisdiction under Rule 1-060 NMRA, concerning relief from a judgment or order, to modify property rights portion of the order, a party in the divorce could achieve a modification pursuant to this section.Mendoza v. Mendoza, 1985-NMCA-088, 103 N.M. 327, 706 P.2d 869.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Federal Taxation of New Mexico Community Property,\" see 3 Nat.
