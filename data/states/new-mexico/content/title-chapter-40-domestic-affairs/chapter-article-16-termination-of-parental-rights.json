      "text": "A. At any time, a biological parent may petition the court for termination of the parental rights of a child's other biological parent, where that other biological parent has been convicted of criminal sexual penetration and where the criminal sexual penetration resulted in the conception and birth of the child. The court shall grant the petition if the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that the child was conceived as a result of the criminal sexual penetration for which the other biological parent was convicted.\n\nB. In a proceeding that involves a child subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, the grounds for any attempted termination shall be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and shall meet the requirements set forth in that act, and the court shall, in a termination order, make specific findings that those requirements were met.\n\nC. A determination pursuant to Subsection A of this section or proof pursuant to Subsection B of this section creates a presumption that termination of parental rights is in the best interest of the child.\n\nD. As used in this section, \"criminal sexual penetration\" means aggravated criminal sexual penetration in the first degree and criminal sexual penetration in the first, second or third degree pursuant to the laws of this state or an equivalent offense pursuant to the laws of another jurisdiction, territory or possession of the United States or an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo.\n\nHistory:Laws 2017, ch. 121, § 1.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2017, ch. 121, § 2 made Laws 2017, ch. 121, § 1 effective July 1, 2017.\n\nCross references.— For the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978,see25 U.S.C. § 1901, et seq.",
