Such compliance will speed up the processing of cases and completion of enforcement actions, thereby reducing expenditures for aid to families with dependent children.\n\nHistory:Laws 1988, ch. 127, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For Title IV D of the federal Social Security Act,see42 U.S.C. § 651 et seq.",
