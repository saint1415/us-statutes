      "text": "A. A person may seek enforcement of a valid foreign protection order in a New Mexico tribunal. The tribunal shall enforce the terms of the order, including terms that provide relief that a New Mexico tribunal would lack power to provide but for this section. The tribunal shall enforce the order, whether the order was obtained by independent action or in another proceeding, if it is an order issued in response to a complaint, petition or motion filed by or on behalf of a person seeking protection. In a proceeding to enforce a foreign protection order, the tribunal shall follow New Mexico procedures for the enforcement of protection orders.\n\nB. A New Mexico tribunal shall not enforce a foreign protection order issued by a tribunal of a state that does not recognize the standing of a protected individual to seek enforcement of the order.\n\nC. A New Mexico tribunal shall enforce the provisions of a valid foreign protection order governing custody and visitation, if the order was issued in accordance with the jurisdictional requirements governing the issuance of custody and visitation orders in the issuing state.\n\nD. A foreign protection order is valid if it:\n\n(1) identifies the protected individual and the respondent;\n\n(2) is currently in effect;\n\n(3) was issued by a tribunal that had jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter under the law of the issuing state; and\n\n(4) was issued after the respondent was given reasonable notice and had an opportunity to be heard before the tribunal issued the order or, in the case of an ex parte order, the respondent was given notice and has had or will have an opportunity to be heard within a reasonable time after the order was issued in a manner consistent with the due process rights of the respondent.\n\nE. A foreign protection order valid on its face is prima facie evidence of its validity.\n\nF. Absence of any of the criteria for validity of a foreign protection order is an affirmative defense in an action seeking enforcement of the order.\n\nG. A New Mexico tribunal may enforce provisions of a mutual foreign protection order only if:\n\n(1) both parties filed a written pleading seeking a protection order from the tribunal of the issuing state; and\n\n(2) the tribunal of the issuing state made specific findings that each party was entitled to a protection order.\n\nHistory:Laws 2013, ch. 47, § 3.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2013, ch. 47, § 11 provided that the Uniform Interstate Enforcement of Domestic Violence Protection Orders Act was effective July 1, 2013.",

For the purposes of this section, a protection order may be inscribed on a tangible medium or may have been stored in an electronic or other medium if it is retrievable in perceivable form. Presentation of a certified copy of a protection order is not required for enforcement.\n\nB. If a foreign protection order is not presented, a New Mexico law enforcement officer may consider other information in determining whether there is probable cause to believe that a valid foreign protection order exists.\n\nC. If a New Mexico law enforcement officer determines that an otherwise valid foreign protection order cannot be enforced because the respondent has not been notified or served with the order, the officer shall inform the respondent of the order, make a reasonable effort to serve the order upon the respondent and allow the respondent a reasonable opportunity to comply with the order before enforcing the order.\n\nD.
