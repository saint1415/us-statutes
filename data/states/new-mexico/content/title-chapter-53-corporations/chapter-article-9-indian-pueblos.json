Joseph, 94 U.S. (94 Otto) 614, 24 L. Ed. 295 (1876).But seeMountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Pueblo of Santa Ana, 472 U.S. 237, 105 S. Ct. 2587, 86 L.

Ed. 2d 131 (1961).\n\nValidity of \"Kearny Code\" and acts of 1847.— The system of laws known as the \"Kearny Code,\" and the acts of the general assembly of New Mexico of the December session, 1847, were valid except so far as they attempted to confer political rights upon the inhabitants, under the constitution of the United States, the same having been established by competent authority by virtue of rights of war.Ward v. Broadwell, 1854-NMSC-001, 1 N.M. 75.\n\nEffect of this section.— This section gave the Indian pueblos the status of bodies politic and corporate and as such empowered them to sue in respect of their lands.Garcia v. U.S., 43 F.2d 873 (10th Cir. 1930);Lane v. Pueblo of Santa Rosa, 249 U.S. 110, 39 S. Ct. 185, 63 L.

Ed. 504 (1919).\n\nState jurisdiction over Indians.— Although congress did specifically act to give its consent to the state to assume jurisdiction over the Indians within its boundaries, such jurisdiction is prohibited until the state should amend its constitution or statute, removing any legal impediment to such assumption of jurisdiction.

Village of Espanola, 1961-NMSC-041, 68 N.M. 327, 361 P.2d 950, cert. denied, 368 U.S. 915, 82 S. Ct. 194, 7 L.

Santistevan, 1874-NMSC-003, 1 N.M. 583.\n\nPueblos have right to use limitation statutes.— Indian pueblos were held entitled to the benefits of the New Mexico statutes of limitation which may be pleaded by the United States, as their guardian, in their behalf.Garcia v. U.S., 43 F.2d 873 (10th Cir. 1930).\n\nPueblo lands taxable.— The lands of the Pueblo Indians in New Mexico are taxable.Territory v. Persons & Prop. Described in Delinquent Tax List, 1904-NMSC-008, 12 N.M. 139, 76 P. 307.\n\nSales tax may not be levied.— The statutory definition of \"federal area\" in 4 U.S.C. § 110(e) and the authorization of the imposition of sales tax by 4 U.S.C. § 105(a) was not intended to give the states or localities permission to levy a sales tax upon Indian lands.Your Food Stores, Inc. v. Village of Espanola, 1961-NMSC-041, 68 N.M. 327, 361 P.2d 950, cert. denied, 368 U.S. 915, 82 S. Ct. 194, 7 L.

Tenorio, 1940-NMSC-002, 44 N.M. 89, 98 P.2d 838.\n\nNo state court jurisdiction where auto accident on pueblo.— The district court of Bernalillo county properly dismissed action by resident of Isleta Pueblo, New Mexico, against another resident thereof, for damages for automobile collision which occurred within an area embraced by Valencia county, New Mexico, for lack of jurisdiction, the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico being under the jurisdiction of the United States. The accident did not occur on land of the state of New Mexico and title to the land of the Isleta Pueblo was in the Indian tribe and had never been extinguished.Valdez v. Johnson, 1961-NMSC-089, 68 N.M. 476, 362 P.2d 1004.\n\nPueblo actions not under color of state law.— The Pueblos do not derive their governmental powers from the state of New Mexico nor from the United States and consequently, there was no basis for holding that the conduct of the defendants (Pueblo civil authorities) of which the plaintiffs (Protestant Pueblo Indians) complain (allegedly subjecting plaintiffs to indignities, threats and reprisals because of their faith) was done under color of state law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage.Toledo v. Pueblo De Jemez, 119 F. Supp. 429 (D.N.M. 1954).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Indian Tax Cases - A Territorial Analysis,\" see 9 N.M. L. Rev. 221 (1979).",
