      "text": "Chapter 53, Articles 11 through 18 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Business Corporation Act\".\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 51-24-1, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 81, § 1; 1977, ch. 103, § 9; 1998, ch. 108, § 27; 2001, ch. 200, § 40.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is derived from Section 1 of the ABA Model Business Corporation Act.\n\nCross references.— For Professional Corporation Act,see53-6-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor Uniform Unclaimed Property Act,seeChapter 7, Article 8A NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, substituted \"Chapter 53, Articles 11 through 18 NMSA 1978\" for \"Sections 53-11-1 through 53-18-12 NMSA 1978 is the general corporation law of New Mexico and\".\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective January 1, 1999, substituted \"53-11-1 through 53-18-12 NMSA 1978\" for \"51-31-11 NMSA 1953\" near the beginning of the section.\n\nLiability of shareholder.— Nothing in Article 15 of the Business Corporation Act or in the Professional Corporation Act (53-6-1 to 53-6-14 NMSA 1978) permits rendering an individual judgment against a shareholder of a professional corporation based solely upon a failure of the corporation to properly value the stock of the corporation. For that reason, such liability must be predicated on a theory outside the language of the statute.Morrow v. Cooper, 1991-NMCA-108, 113 N.M. 246, 824 P.2d 1048.\n\nPiercing the corporate veil.— A corporation will ordinarily be treated as a legal entity separate from its shareholders, and individual shareholders cannot be held personally liable for the corporation's debt. Under certain circumstances, however, courts may exercise their equitable powers to pierce the corporate veil and require shareholders to answer for the corporation's liability. To pierce the corporate veil, the district court must find that the corporation was operated in a fashion not to serve the valid goals and purposes of that corporation but instead under the domination and control and for the purposes of some dominant party, that there is some form of moral culpability attributable to the shareholder such as use of the corporation to perpetrate a fraud, and that there is some reasonable relationship between the injury suffered by the plaintiff and the actions of the defendant.Morrissey v. Krystopowicz, 2016-NMCA-011.\n\nWhere defendant set up corporations to own and operate a number of nursing homes in New Mexico, and where defendant channeled millions of dollars from the revenues of the nursing homes to an account controlled by defendant, from which hundreds of thousands of dollars in distributions were made to defendant and a co-owner of the corporation, evidence that defendant exercised improper domination of the corporations, that defendant used the corporations for improper purposes, and that defendant's abuse of the corporate form resulted in a sham corporation leading to plaintiff's inability to recover for her injury, was sufficient to pierce the corporate veil of the sham corporations such that defendant can be held liable for the corporations' liabilities.Morrissey v. Krystopowicz, 2016-NMCA-011.\n\nFraud in the inducement in shareholder agreement of professional corporation.— Where there is fraud in the inducement to enter into a shareholder agreement, the contract is voidable, capable of being affirmed or rejected at the option of one of the parties, and remains in effect until the fraud by which the defrauded party had been induced to sign is discovered.Jones v. Aug, 2015-NMCA-016, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere appellant shareholder, without the knowledge of other shareholders, modified his shareholder employment agreement, putting in place a more generous deferred compensation package than the other shareholders, there is fraud in the inducement to enter into the contract and the contract is voidable, remaining in effect until the fraud is discovered.Jones v. Aug, 2015-NMCA-016, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nPunitive damages for breach of fiduciary duties.— Punitive damages are appropriate when an actor willfully breaches fiduciary duties.Jones v. Aug, 2015-NMCA-016, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere appellant shareholder, without the knowledge of other shareholders, modified his shareholder employment agreement, putting in place a more generous deferred compensation package than the other shareholders, overpaid himself by hundreds of thousands of dollars, failed to inform other shareholders of bonuses paid to himself without appropriate basis, controlled the shareholder allocation sheets that the shareholders used to track their compensation, failed to inform other shareholders of material facts and information relating to business and financial affairs, knowingly submitted incorrect information about his bonuses at shareholder meetings, and knowingly and intentionally paid himself bonuses to the substantial economic detriment of the other shareholders and the corporation itself, the award of punitive damages was appropriate.Jones v. Aug, 2015-NMCA-016, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nContract reformation is a remedy for fraud and may form the basis for an award of punitive damages.— Contract reformation is an equitable remedy by which a court will modify a written agreement to reflect the actual intent of the parties, usually to correct fraud or mutual mistake in the writing; where a plaintiff has established a cause of action in equity and the wrongdoer's misconduct is willful, wanton, malicious, reckless, fraudulent and in bad faith, punitive damages are allowable to do complete justice.Jones v. Aug, 2015-NMCA-016, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere appellant shareholder, without the knowledge of other shareholders, modified his shareholder employment agreement, putting in place a more generous deferred compensation package than the other shareholders, overpaid himself by hundreds of thousands of dollars, failed to inform other shareholders of bonuses paid to himself without appropriate basis, controlled the shareholder allocation sheets that the shareholders used to track their compensation, failed to inform other shareholders of material facts and information relating to business and financial affairs, knowingly submitted incorrect information about his bonuses at shareholder meetings, and knowingly and intentionally paid himself bonuses to the substantial economic detriment of the other shareholders and the corporation itself, appellees request to make all the shareholder agreements equal fell squarely within the definition of the equitable remedy of contract reformation, and the award of punitive damages was appropriate.Jones v. Aug, 2015-NMCA-016, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nAct inapplicable to corporation organized for banking.— The powers and authorities established for corporations by the Business Corporation Act, including the authority to issue preferred stock, would not apply to a corporation organized for the purpose of banking. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-06.\n\nHow corporation may be terminated.— A corporation being granted life by the act of a sovereign, that is by the act of the laws of the state wherein it is incorporated, nothing less than that power or the lapse of the period of life provided by the articles of incorporation or by the dissolution of the corporation by permission of the sovereignty can take that life away. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5723 (rendered under former law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part I,\" see 1 Nat. Res.

Mahaney, 1976-NMCA-038, 89 N.M. 208, 549 P.2d 623, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 322, 551 P.2d 1369.\n\nCorporate entity disregarded when used for fraud or injustice.— The corporate entity should be recognized and supported; however, it will be disregarded by the courts when the corporation is used to perpetrate fraud or promote injustice.Scott Graphics, Inc. v.

As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"director\" means any person who is or was a director of the corporation and any person who, while a director of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation or nonprofit corporation, cooperative, partnership, joint venture, trust, other incorporated or unincorporated enterprise or employee benefit plan or trust;\n\n(2) \"corporation\" includes any domestic or foreign predecessor entity of the corporation in a merger, consolidation or other transaction in which the predecessor's existence ceased upon consummation of such transaction;\n\n(3) \"expenses\" include attorneys' fees;\n\n(4) \"official capacity\" means:\n\n(a) when used with respect to a director, the office of director in the corporation; and\n\n(b) when used with respect to a person other than a director, as contemplated in Subsection I of this section, the elective or appointive office in the corporation held by the officer or the employment or agency relationship undertaken by the employee or agent in behalf of the corporation, but in each case does not include service for any other foreign or domestic corporation or nonprofit corporation, or any cooperative, partnership, joint venture, trust, other incorporated or unincorporated enterprise or employee benefit plan or trust;\n\n(5) \"party\" includes a person who was, is or is threatened to be made, a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding; and\n\n(6) \"proceeding\" means any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative.\n\nB. A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director if:\n\n(1) the person acted in good faith;\n\n(2) the person reasonably believed:\n\n(a) in the case of conduct in the person's official capacity with the corporation, that the person's conduct was in its best interests; and\n\n(b) in all other cases, that the person's conduct was at least not opposed to its best interests; and\n\n(3) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the person had no reasonable cause to believe the person's conduct was unlawful. Indemnification may be made against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses, actually incurred by the person in connection with the proceeding; except that if the proceeding was by or in the right of the corporation, indemnification may be made only against such reasonable expenses and shall not be made in respect of any proceeding in which the person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, be determinative that the person did not meet the requisite standard of conduct set forth in this subsection.\n\nC. A director shall not be indemnified under Subsection B of this section in respect of any proceeding charging improper personal benefit to the director, whether or not involving action in the director's official capacity, in which the director shall have been adjudged to be liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received by the director.\n\nD. Unless limited by the articles of incorporation:\n\n(1) a director who, in the opinion of the board of directors reasonably based on the facts, circumstances and outcome of the proceeding, has been wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding referred to in Subsection B of this section shall be indemnified against reasonable expenses incurred by the director in connection with the proceeding; or\n\n(2) a court of appropriate jurisdiction, upon application of a director and such notice as the court shall require, shall have authority to order indemnification in the following circumstances:\n\n(a) if it determines a director is entitled to reimbursement under Paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court shall order indemnification, in which case the director shall also be entitled to recover the reasonable expenses of securing such reimbursement; or\n\n(b) if it determines that the director is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, whether or not the director has met the standard of conduct set forth in Subsection B of this section or has been adjudged liable in the circumstances described in Subsection C of this section. The court may order such indemnification except that indemnification with respect to any proceeding by or in the right of the corporation or in which liability shall have been adjudged in the circumstances described in Subsection C of this section shall be limited to reasonable expenses. A court of appropriate jurisdiction may be the same court in which the proceeding involving the director's liability took place.\n\nE. No indemnification under Subsection B of this section shall be made by the corporation unless authorized in the specific case after a determination has been made that indemnification of the director is permissible in the circumstances because the director has met the standard of conduct set forth in Subsection B of this section. Such determination shall be made:\n\n(1) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;\n\n(2) if such a quorum cannot be obtained, by a majority vote of a committee of the board duly designated to act in the matter by a majority vote of the full board, in which designation directors who are parties may participate, and consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;\n\n(3) by special legal counsel, selected by the board of directors or a committee thereof by vote as set forth in Paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection or, if the requisite quorum of the full board cannot be obtained therefor and such committee cannot be established, by a majority vote of the full board, in which selection directors who are parties may participate; or\n\n(4) by the shareholders.\n\nAuthorization of indemnification and determination as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is permissible, except that if the determination that indemnification is permissible is made by special legal counsel, authorization of indemnification and determination as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in a manner specified in Paragraph (3) of Subsection E of this section for the selection of such counsel. Shares held by directors who are parties to the proceeding shall not be voted on the subject matter under this subsection.\n\nF. Reasonable expenses incurred by a director who is a party to a proceeding may be paid or reimbursed by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding if:\n\n(1) the director furnishes the corporation a written affirmation of his good faith belief that the director has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the corporation as authorized in this section;\n\n(2) the director furnishes the corporation a written undertaking by or on behalf of the director to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the director has not met such standards of conduct; and\n\n(3) a determination is made that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification under this section.\n\nThe undertaking required by Paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be an unlimited general obligation of the director but need not be secured and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment. Determinations and authorizations of payments under this subsection shall be made in the manner specified in Subsection E of this section.\n\nG. The indemnification authorized by this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, an agreement, a resolution of shareholders or directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.\n\nH. For purposes of this section, the corporation shall be deemed to have requested a director to serve an employee benefit plan whenever the performance by the director of duties to the corporation also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, the director to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on a director with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall be deemed \"fines\"; and action taken or omitted by the director with respect to an employee benefit plan in the performance of duties for a purpose reasonably believed by the director to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose which is not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.\n\nI. Unless limited by the articles of incorporation:\n\n(1) an officer of the corporation shall be indemnified as and to the same extent provided in Subsection D of this section for a director and shall be entitled to the same extent as a director to seek indemnification pursuant to the provisions of that subsection;\n\n(2) a corporation shall have the power to indemnify and to advance reasonable expenses to an officer, employee or agent of the corporation to the same extent that it may indemnify and advance reasonable expenses to directors pursuant to this section; and\n\n(3) a corporation, in addition, shall have the power to indemnify and to advance reasonable expenses to an officer, employee or agent who is not a director to such further extent, consistent with law, as may be provided by its articles of incorporation, bylaws, general or specific action of its board of directors, or contract.\n\nJ. A corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance or furnish similar protection, including but not limited to providing a trust fund, a letter of credit or self-insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or who, while a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation or nonprofit corporation, cooperative, partnership, joint venture, trust, other incorporated or unincorporated enterprise or employee benefit plan or trust, against any liability asserted against and incurred by the person in any such capacity or arising out of the person's status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the person against such liability under the provisions of this section.\n\nK. Any indemnification of, or advance of expenses to, a director in accordance with this section, if arising out of a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation, shall be reported in writing to the shareholders with or before the notice of the next shareholders' meeting.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 53-11-4.1, enacted by Laws 1983, ch. 304, § 23; 1987, ch. 238, § 9.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective April 9, 1987, substituted \"other incorporated or unincorporated enterprise or employee benefit plan or trust\" for \"other enterprise or employee benefit plan\" throughout the section; inserted \"reasonable\" preceding \"expenses\" throughout the section; in Subsection A(1), inserted \"or nonprofit corporation, cooperative\"; in Subsection A(4)(b), inserted \"or nonprofit corporation, or any cooperative\"; in Subsection D(1), substituted \"in the opinion of the board of directors\" for \"in the board of director's opinion\"; in Subsection D(2)(b), inserted \"except that indemnification\" in the second sentence; in Subsection F, substituted \"final disposition of such proceeding if\" for \"final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt by the corporation of\"; in Subsections F(1) and (2), inserted \"the director furnishes the corporation\" at the beginning; designated part of former Subsection F(2) as present Subsection F(3); in the next-to-last sentence in Subsection F, substituted \"Paragraph (2) of this subsection\" for \"this Paragraph\"; substituted present Subsection G for the former provisions of that subsection as set out in the 1983 Replacement Pamphlet; and in Subsection J, inserted \"or furnished similar protection, including but not limited to providing a trust fund, a letter of credit or self-insurance\" near the beginning and inserted \"or nonprofit corporation, cooperative\" near the middle of the subsection.\n\nThe purpose of this sectionis to encourage qualified individuals to accept the responsibilities of corporate management without fear that expenses incurred by them in performing their duties as directors will not be borne by the corporation they serve. To expand the list of persons entitled to claim the benefit of indemnification to include signatories to a buy-sell agreement, who are litigating questions under that agreement for their own private benefit, would go far beyond this purpose of the statute.Petty v. Bank of N.M. Holding Co., 1990-NMSC-021, 109 N.M. 524, 787 P.2d 443.\n\nScope of power conferred by Subsection B.— Subsection B operates to empower corporations to indemnify their directors and other agents; it does not confer on the indemnified director an unquestionable right to indemnification.Petty v. Bank of N.M. Holding Co., 1990-NMSC-021, 109 N.M. 524, 787 P.2d 443.\n\nEffect of Subsection D(1).— Subsection D(1) gives a director who has been wholly successful in the defense of a proceeding the absolute right to indemnification under the circumstances contemplated by it, and it makes the \"opinion of the board of directors\" final on the question, assuming that their opinion is \"reasonable.\"Petty v. Bank of N.M. Holding Co., 1990-NMSC-021, 109 N.M. 524, 787 P.2d 443.",

Under certain circumstances, however, courts may exercise their equitable powers to pierce the corporate veil and require shareholders to answer for the corporation's liability. To pierce the corporate veil, the district court must find that the corporation was operated in a fashion not to serve the valid goals and purposes of that corporation but instead under the domination and control and for the purposes of some dominant party, that there is some form of moral culpability attributable to the shareholder such as use of the corporation to perpetrate a fraud, and that there is some reasonable relationship between the injury suffered by the plaintiff and the actions of the defendant.Morrissey v. Krystopowicz, 2016-NMCA-011.\n\nWhere defendant set up corporations to own and operate a number of nursing homes in New Mexico, and where defendant channeled millions of dollars from the revenues of the nursing homes to an account controlled by defendant, from which hundreds of thousands of dollars in distributions were made to defendant and a co-owner of the corporation, evidence that defendant exercised improper domination of the corporations, that defendant used the corporations for improper purposes, and that defendant's abuse of the corporate form resulted in a sham corporation leading to plaintiff's inability to recover for her injury, was sufficient to pierce the corporate veil of the sham corporations such that defendant can be held liable for the corporations' liabilities.Morrissey v.

The articles of incorporation may grant, either absolutely or conditionally to the holders of bonds, debentures or other obligations of the corporation the power to vote on specified matters, including the election of directors, and this right shall not be terminated except upon written assent of the holders of a majority in aggregate face amount of the bonds or debentures.\n\nB.

All corporate powers shall be exercised by or under authority of, and the business and affairs of a corporation shall be managed under the direction of, a board of directors except as may be otherwise provided in the Business Corporation Act or the articles of incorporation. If any such provision is made in the articles of incorporation, the powers and duties conferred or imposed upon the board of directors by the Business Corporation Act shall be exercised or performed to such extent and by such person or persons as provided in the articles of incorporation. Directors need not be residents of this state or shareholders of the corporation unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws so require. The articles of incorporation or bylaws may prescribe other qualifications for directors. The board of directors may fix the compensation of directors unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation.\n\nB. A director shall perform his duties as a director, including his duties as a member of any committee of the board upon which the director may serve, in good faith, in a manner the director believes to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and with such care as an ordinarily prudent person would use under similar circumstances in a like position. In performing such duties, a director shall be entitled to rely on factual information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by:\n\n(1) one or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;\n\n(2) counsel, public accountants or other persons as to matters which the director reasonably believes to be within such person's professional or expert competence; or\n\n(3) a committee of the board upon which the director does not serve, duly designated in accordance with a provision of the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, as to matters within its designated authority, which committee the director reasonably believes to merit confidence, but the director shall not be considered to be acting in good faith if the director has knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted. A person who so performs such duties shall have no liability by reason of being or having been a director of the corporation.\n\nC. A director of a corporation who is present at a meeting of its board of directors at which action on any corporate matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless the director's dissent shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless the director shall file written dissent to such action with the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall forward such dissent by registered mail to the secretary of the corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting.

A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the corporation solely because of the director's interest in the transaction if any one of the following is true:\n\n(1) the material facts of the transaction and the director's interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors and the board of directors or committee authorized, approved or ratified the transaction;\n\n(2) the material facts of the transaction and the director's interest were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and they authorized, approved or ratified the transaction; or\n\n(3) the transaction was fair to the corporation.\n\nB. For purposes of this section, a director of the corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction if:\n\n(1) another entity in which he has a material financial interest or in which he is a general partner is a party to the transaction; or\n\n(2) another entity of which he is a director, officer or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the board of directors of the corporation.\n\nFor purposes of this section, a director of the corporation does not have a direct or indirect interest in a transaction solely because the transaction may involve or effect a change in control of the corporation or his continuation in office as a director of that corporation.\n\nC. For purposes of Paragraph (1) of Subsection A of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board or [of] directors or on a committee of the board of directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction but a transaction may not be authorized, approved or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of or a vote cast by a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under Paragraph (1) of Subsection A of this section if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or ratified as provided in that subsection.\n\nD. For purposes of Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the shares entitled to be counted under this subsection.

The vote of those shares, however, is counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of the Business Corporation Act. A majority of the shares, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 53-11-40.1, enacted by Laws 1987, ch. 238, § 11.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material in Subsection C was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.",

Subject to any restrictions in the articles of incorporation, the board of directors may authorize and the corporation may make distributions, except that no distribution may be made if, after giving effect thereto, either:\n\n(1) the corporation would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of its business; or\n\n(2) the corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities and (unless the articles of incorporation otherwise permit) the maximum amount that then would be payable, in any liquidation, in respect of all outstanding shares having preferential rights in liquidation.\n\nB. Determinations under Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of this section may be based upon:\n\n(1) financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances; or\n\n(2) a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nC. In the case of a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of a corporation's shares, the effect of a distribution shall be measured as of the date money or other property is transferred or debt is incurred by the corporation, or as of the date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder of the corporation with respect to such shares, whichever is earlier. In all other cases, the effect of a distribution shall be measured as of the date of its authorization, or as of the date of payment if payment occurs more than one hundred twenty days following the date of authorization.\n\nD. Indebtedness of a corporation incurred or issued to a shareholder in a distribution in accordance with this section shall be on a parity with the indebtedness of the corporation to its general unsecured creditors except to the extent subordinated by agreement.\n\nE.

(now repealed). Through adoption of different accounting methods from those used over the years, it would be just as easy to create a profit or surplus as by a revaluation of assets, and neither is to be condoned.Woodson v.

Any director against whom a claim is asserted under this section for the making of a distribution and who shall be held liable thereon, shall be entitled to contribution from the shareholders who accepted or received any such distribution, knowing the distribution to have been made in violation of the Business Corporation Act, in proportion to the amounts received by them.\n\nC. Any director against whom a claim shall be asserted under or pursuant to this section shall be entitled to contribution from any other director who voted for or assented to the action upon which the claim is asserted and who did not comply with the standard provided in the Business Corporation Act for the performance of the duties of directors.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 51-24-45, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 81, § 45; 1975, ch. 64, § 23; 1983, ch. 304, § 40.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is derived from Section 48 of the ABA Model Business Corporation Act.\n\nThe 1983 amendment,effective June 17, 1983, redesignated former Paragraph (1) of Subsection A as present Subsection A; deleted former Paragraphs (2) and (3) of Subsection A and former Subsections B and C, which concerned the liability of directors of a corporation who vote for the illegal purchase of its own shares or for the illegal distribution of assets during liquidation, presumed assent to actions taken by the board absent express dissent, and presumption of good faith reliance on financial statements; redesignated former Subsections D and E as present Subsections B and C, respectively; near the beginning of Subsection A deleted \"imposed by law upon directors of a corporation\" following \"liabilities\" and substituted \"a director who votes for or assents to any distribution\" for \"directors of a corporation who vote for or assent to the declaration of any dividend or other distribution of the assets of a corporation to its shareholders,\" near the middle of Subsection A inserted \"unless the director . . . duties of directors,\" deleted \"jointly and severally\" preceding \"liable\" and inserted \"jointly and severally with all other directors so voting or assenting,\" and near the end of Subsection A substituted \"distribution\" for \"assets which are distributed,\" deleted \"dividend or\" preceding \"distribution,\" and substituted \"made\" for \"paid or distributed\"; substituted \"making of a distribution\" for \"payment of a dividend or other distribution of assets of a corporation\" near the beginning of Subsection B; substituted \"distribution, knowing the distribution\" for \"dividend or assets, knowing the dividend or distribution\" near the middle of Subsection B; and inserted \"or pursuant to\" near the beginning of Subsection C, substituted \"any other director\" for \"the other directors\" near the middle of Subsection C, and added \"and who did not . . . the duties of directors\" at the end of Subsection C.\n\nForbidden distributions to stockholders defined.— It is clear that forbidden distributions to shareholders out of capital surplus of a corporation of a portion of its assets, in cash or profits, are those distributions to shareholders of corporate property paid to the corporation by the shareholders in excess of the capital stock liability, which would render the corporation insolvent, would deprive preferential shareholders of accrued dividends to which they were entitled, or would reduce the corporation's assets below the amount preferential shareholders could claim in the event of involuntary liquidation.DiIaconi v.

No action shall be brought in this state by a shareholder in the right of a domestic or foreign corporation unless:\n\n(1) the plaintiff was a shareholder of record or the beneficial owner of shares held by a nominee or the holder of voting trust certificates at the time of the transaction of which he complains, or his shares or his beneficial ownership of shares held by a nominee or voting trust certificates thereafter devolved upon him by operation of law from a person who was a holder of record at such time;\n\n(2) the complaint be verified; and\n\n(3) the complaint alleges with particularity the efforts, if any, made by the plaintiff to obtain the action he desires from the directors and the reasons for his failure to obtain the action or for not making the effort. If the corporation undertakes an investigation upon receipt of a demand by plaintiff for action, or following commencement of suit, the court may stay any action commenced as the circumstances reasonably require.\n\nB. In any action hereafter instituted in the right of any domestic or foreign corporation by the person or persons described in the above paragraph, the court having jurisdiction, upon final judgment and a finding that the action was brought without reasonable cause, may require the plaintiff or plaintiffs to pay to the parties named as defendant the reasonable expenses, including fees of attorneys, incurred by them in the defense of such action.\n\nC. An action authorized by this section shall not be discontinued, compromised or settled without approval by the court having jurisdiction of the action. If the court determines that the interest of the shareholders or of any class thereof will be substantially affected by the discontinuance, compromise or settlement, the court may direct that notice, by publication or otherwise, be given to the shareholders or any class thereof whose interests it determines will be so affected.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 51-24-45.1, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 64, § 24; 1983, ch. 304, § 41.\n\nThe 1983 amendment,effective June 17, 1983, added \"Provisions relating to\" at the beginning of the catchline; designated part of former Subsection A as present Paragraph (1) of Subsection A; in Paragraph (1) of Subsection A substituted \"shareholder of record or the beneficial owner of shares held by a nominee or the holder\" for \"holder of record of shares or,\" deleted \"therefor\" following \"voting trust certificates,\" and inserted \"his beneficial ownership of shares held by a nominee or\"; added Paragraphs (2) and (3) of Subsection A; substituted \"person or persons described in the above paragraph\" for \"holder or holders of record of shares of such corporation or of voting trust certificates therefor\" near the beginning of Subsection B; and added Subsection C.\n\nStanding to bring individual action.— Where plaintiffs and defendant were equal shareholders in a closely held corporation; the corporation purchased residential property were defendant could reside and run the corporate business; defendant made all payments on the purchase price of the residential property; the corporation ceased to operate, but the corporation was not dissolved and the assets were not divided among the shareholders; defendant, as president of the corporation, executed a deed conveying the residential property to defendant, and defendant took cash out of the residential property through the refinancing of the residential property, plaintiffs had standing to sue defendant individually for a breach of fiduciary duty in the sale of corporate assets in violation of 53-15-1 NMSA 1978.Clark v. Sims, 2009-NMCA-118, 147 N.M. 252, 219 P.3d 20, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-009, 147 N.M. 421, 224 P.3d 648.\n\nA stockholder who directly attacks the fairness or validity of a merger alleges a direct injury to the stockholders, not the corporation, and has standing to pursue the shareholder's direct claims.Rael v. Page, 2009-NMCA-123, 147 N.M. 306, 222 P.3d 678, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-009, 147 N.M. 421, 224 P.3d 648.\n\nWhere plaintiff, who was a shareholder in a corporation that had been merged out of existence, claimed that the merger was unfair and resulted in an unfair share price paid to shareholders because the directors of the corporation breached fiduciary duties by engaging in self-interested negotiations with potential buyers of the corporation, devaluing the corporation for personal gain, and conducting unfair and misleading voting processes, plaintiff alleged a direct injury to the shareholders and plaintiff had standing to pursue plaintiff's direct claims against the directors for damages.Rael v. Page, 2009-NMCA-123, 147 N.M. 306, 222 P.3d 678, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-009, 147 N.M. 421, 224 P.3d 648.\n\nAttorney's fees.— Where defendant and plaintiffs were equal shareholders in a closely held corporation and defendant transferred the corporation's sole asset to defendant and took cash out of the asset through the refinancing of the asset, attorney's fees were not recoverable by plaintiffs.Clark v. Sims, 2009-NMCA-118, 147 N.M. 252, 219 P.3d 20, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-009, 147 N.M. 421, 224 P.3d 648.\n\nBreach of fiduciary duty.— A fiduciary duty is a duty of utmost good faith, trust, confidence, and candor owed by a fiduciary such as a corporate officer to a beneficiary such as a shareholder, and involves a duty to act with the highest degree of honesty and loyalty toward another person and in the best interests of the other person; a breach of duties imposed by contract may also constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of loyalty, good faith, inherent fairness and the obligation not to profit at the expense of the corporation.Jones v. Aug, 2015-NMCA-016, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere appellant shareholder overpaid himself by hundreds of thousands of dollars, failed to inform other shareholders of bonuses paid to himself without appropriate basis, controlled the shareholder allocation sheets that the shareholders used to track their compensation, failed to inform other shareholders of material facts and information relating to business and financial affairs, knowingly submitted incorrect information about his bonuses at shareholder meetings, and knowingly and intentionally paid himself bonuses to the substantial economic detriment of the other shareholders and the corporation itself, there was sufficient evidence to support the district court's decision that appellee breached his fiduciary duties.Jones v. Aug, 2015-NMCA-016, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nPunitive damages for breach of fiduciary duties.— Punitive damages are appropriate when an actor willfully breaches fiduciary duties; where punitive damages are requested, it must be determined whether the actor acted with a culpable mental state.Jones v. Aug, 2015-NMCA-016, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere appellant shareholder, without the knowledge of other shareholders, modified his shareholder employment agreement, putting in place a more generous deferred compensation package than the other shareholders, overpaid himself by hundreds of thousands of dollars, failed to inform other shareholders of bonuses paid to himself without appropriate basis, controlled the shareholder allocation sheets that the shareholders used to track their compensation, failed to inform other shareholders of material facts and information relating to business and financial affairs, knowingly submitted incorrect information about his bonuses at shareholder meetings, and knowingly and intentionally paid himself bonuses to the substantial economic detriment of the other shareholders and the corporation itself, the award of punitive damages was appropriate.Jones v. Aug, 2015-NMCA-016, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nContract reformation is a remedy for fraud and may form the basis for an award of punitive damages.— Contract reformation is an equitable remedy by which a court will modify a written agreement to reflect the actual intent of the parties, usually to correct fraud or mutual mistake in the writing; where a plaintiff has established a cause of action in equity and the wrongdoer's misconduct is willful, wanton, malicious, reckless, fraudulent and in bad faith, punitive damages are allowable to do complete justice.Jones v. Aug, 2015-NMCA-016, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere appellant shareholder, without the knowledge of other shareholders, modified his shareholder employment agreement, putting in place a more generous deferred compensation package than the other shareholders, overpaid himself by hundreds of thousands of dollars, failed to inform other shareholders of bonuses paid to himself without appropriate basis, controlled the shareholder allocation sheets that the shareholders used to track their compensation, failed to inform other shareholders of material facts and information relating to business and financial affairs, knowingly submitted incorrect information about his bonuses at shareholder meetings, and knowingly and intentionally paid himself bonuses to the substantial economic detriment of the other shareholders and the corporation itself, appellees request to make all the shareholder agreements equal fell squarely within the definition of the equitable remedy of contract reformation, and the award of punitive damages was appropriate.Jones v. Aug, 2015-NMCA-016, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nStanding for shareholder action.— The contemporaneous ownership requirement also includes a continuous ownership rule, requiring contemporaneous and continuous ownership of stock throughout the duration of litigation to maintain standing in a derivative action.White ex rel. Banes Co. Derivative Action v. Banes Co., 1993-NMSC-078, 116 N.M. 611, 866 P.2d 339.\n\nSubsection B sanction appropriate if action \"groundless.\"— The phrase \"without reasonable cause\" means \"groundless\", and the subjective standard should be used. Under this interpretation, for the plaintiff to be sanctioned with attorney's fees, a showing must be made that he or she subjectively knew at the time the suit was filed that the complaint was groundless. A \"groundless\" claim is one in which the allegations in the complaint are not in good faith discoverable through litigation.White ex rel. Banes Co. Derivative Action v.
