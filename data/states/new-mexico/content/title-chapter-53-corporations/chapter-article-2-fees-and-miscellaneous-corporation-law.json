Ed. 24 (1937).\n\nMethod for setting such fee constitutional.— It is not an unconstitutional burden upon interstate commerce that a state statute makes the authorized capital stock of a foreign corporation seeking to do intrastate business the measure of the fee to be paid as a condition to admission to the state.Atl.

Ed. 24 (1937).\n\nFee proper whenever differential between prior authorized and new stock.— The corporation commission (now secretary of state) would be complying with the statute by charging filing fees upon the differential amount between the prior authorized capital stock and the new capital stock, regardless of the fact whether or not the increased authorized stock would take the corporation into a new bracket in computing the fee. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5667 (rendered under former law).\n\nAmendment changing no par stock to par.— Where a foreign corporation had paid an admission fee to the state corporation commission (now secretary of state) upon filing its articles of incorporation, and now has filed an amendment changing its no par value common stock to that of par value and in connection therewith increasing the number of shares of common stock, it is not entitled to file the amendment without payment of any fee. 1954 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 54-6064 (rendered under former law).\n\nFees are in nature of franchise tax.— The fees payable to the corporation commission (now secretary of state) are in the nature of a franchise tax for the privilege of operating as a corporation. 1941 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 41-3901.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"The Entry and Regulation of Foreign Corporations Under New Mexico Law and Under the Model Business Corporation Act,\" see 6 Nat. Res.
