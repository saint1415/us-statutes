      "text": "No foreign corporation shall transact business in this state until it has procured a certificate of authority to do so from the commission [secretary of state]. No foreign corporation shall procure a certificate of authority under the Business Corporation Act to transact in this state any business which a corporation organized under the Business Corporation Act is not permitted to transact. A foreign corporation shall not be denied a certificate of authority because the laws of the state or country under which the corporation is organized governing its organization and internal affairs differ from the laws of this state, and nothing in the Business Corporation Act authorizes this state to regulate the organization or the internal affairs of such corporation. Without excluding other activities which may not constitute transacting business in this state, a foreign corporation shall not be considered to be transacting business in this state, for the purposes of the Business Corporation Act, by reason of carrying on in this state any one or more of the following activities:\n\nA. maintaining or defending any action or suit or any administrative or arbitration proceeding, or effecting the settlement thereof or the settlement of claims or disputes;\n\nB. holding meetings of its directors or shareholders or carrying on other activities concerning its internal affairs;\n\nC. maintaining bank accounts;\n\nD. maintaining offices or agencies for the transfer, exchange and registration of its securities, or appointing and maintaining trustees or depositaries with relation to its securities;\n\nE. effecting sales through independent contractors;\n\nF. soliciting or procuring orders, whether by mail or through employees or agents or otherwise, where the orders require acceptance without this state before becoming binding contracts;\n\nG. creating as borrower or lender, or acquiring, indebtedness or mortgages or other security interest in real or personal property;\n\nH. securing or collecting debts or enforcing any rights in property securing them;\n\nI. transacting any business in interstate commerce;\n\nJ. conducting an isolated transaction completed within a period of thirty days and not in the course of a number of repeated transactions of like nature; or\n\nK. investing in or acquiring, in transactions outside New Mexico, royalties and other nonoperating mineral interests and the execution of division orders, contracts of sale and other instruments incidental to the ownership of the nonoperating mineral interests.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 51-30-1, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 81, § 103; 1969, ch. 48, § 1; 1975, ch. 64, § 40.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nLaws 2013, ch. 75, § 9 provided that as of July 1, 2013, the secretary of state, pursuant to N.M. const., Art. 11, § 19, shall assume responsibility for chartering corporations as provided by law, including the performance of the functions of the former corporations bureau of the public regulation commission, and that except for Subsection D of 53-5-8 NMSA 1978, references to the \"public regulation commission\", \"state corporation commission\" or \"commission\" shall be construed to be references to the secretary of state.See8-4-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is derived from Section 106 of the ABA Model Business Corporation Act.\n\nRequirements for resort to state courts.— These provisions establish requirements for corporations should they desire to resort to the courts of this state in seeking remedies while the long arm statute submits a corporation to the jurisdiction of the courts through its acts, regardless of the corporation's intention to use the courts.Winward v. Holly Creek Mills, Inc., 1972-NMSC-009, 83 N.M. 469, 493 P.2d 954.\n\nJurisdictional test not created by provisions as to soliciting orders.— The statutory language of this section dealing with the solicitation of orders as not constituting transaction of business within New Mexico, is for purposes of the Business Corporation Act, and not for testing jurisdiction under 38-1-16 NMSA 1978.Winward v. Holly Creek Mills, Inc., 1972-NMSC-009, 83 N.M. 469, 493 P.2d 954.\n\nEngineering consulting services constitute \"transacting business\".— A company that provides consulting services in the field of engineering in order to promote a demand for manufacturers' products among potential customers, and that provides extensive engineering services for clients and customers alike in New Mexico, is transacting business within the ambit of this section and therefore is barred under 53-17-20 NMSA 1978 from maintaining any action, suit or proceeding in any court of this state.Applied Techs. Assocs. v. Schmidt, 362 F. Supp. 1103 (D.N.M. 1973).\n\nActs not constituting transaction of business in state.— Where nonauthorized foreign corporation was directly responsible to the insurance companies it represented for business produced and premiums collected by the local agent, who, in turn, became directly responsible to foreign corporation for the remittance of premium monies due, the debtor-creditor relationship created arose out of the agency relationship between the local agent and the insurers and is but incidental to the transaction of their insurance business in New Mexico. It did not arise out of the transaction of business in New Mexico by foreign corporation in its own corporate capacity.J.H. Silversmith, Inc. v. Keeter, 1963-NMSC-099, 72 N.M. 246, 382 P.2d 720 (decided under former law).\n\nWhere foreign corporation does not maintain an office in New Mexico, nor solicit business for itself as a general agency independent of the companies licensed to do business here for which it acts nor make separate contracts with local agents on its own behalf, it is not said to be transacting business in New Mexico.J.H. Silversmith, Inc. v. Keeter, 1963-NMSC-099, 72 N.M. 246, 382 P.2d 720 (decided under former law).\n\nThe appointment and removal of local agents or the collection of premiums for insurance written on behalf of licensed insurance companies by a nonresident insurance agency corporation does not constitute the \"transaction of business\" by that agency.J.H. Silversmith, Inc. v. Keeter, 1963-NMSC-099, 72 N.M. 246, 382 P.2d 720.\n\nTexas company's representative in New Mexico who only solicits offers for contracts which are relayed back to Texas for acceptance is not doing business in New Mexico and is not barred from suing in New Mexico on contract by statute which requires certain types of businesses doing business in New Mexico to obtain a certificate of authorization to transact business in New Mexico.Don J. Cummings Co. v. Aluminum Mfg. Corp., 371 F.2d 118 (10th Cir. 1967).\n\nWhere court construes previous decisions to hold that mere solicitation of a contract in this state by an agent, to be accepted at a home office in a foreign state, amounts to the transaction of business and that any action thereon is barred, the court errs.Vernon Co. v. Reed, 1967-NMSC-261, 78 N.M. 554, 434 P.2d 376 (decided under former law).\n\nWhere plaintiff's only business is financing the purchase of its airplanes to aid sales by its parent corporation and toward this end it creates liens on personal property in New Mexico and its other activities are incidental to and directly related to this permitted activity, such activities do not constitute transacting business within this state.Cessna Fin. Corp. v. Mesilla Valley Flying Serv., Inc., 1969-NMSC-169, 81 N.M. 10, 462 P.2d 144, cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1076, 90 S. Ct. 1521, 25 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1970) (decided under former law).\n\nSince absent isolated acts of debt collection and filing suit, a company's only contact with New Mexico was its ownership of the right to receive payment on loans to New Mexico corporations or individuals that originated from New Mexico banks, the contact was too remote to constitute \"transacting business in this state\" under the closed-door statute (53-17-20 NMSA 1978).Cadle Co. v. Wallach Concrete, Inc., 1993-NMSC-026, 115 N.M. 556, 855 P.2d 130.\n\nSingle act not within statute.— If the making and delivery of the promissory note in New Mexico could be said to constitute transacting business here, it is but a single act of business which this court has held would not bring a foreign corporation within its qualifying statutes.J.H. Silversmith, Inc. v. Keeter, 1963-NMSC-099, 72 N.M. 246, 382 P.2d 720 (decided under former law).\n\nDissolved foreign corporations.— The laws specific to foreign corporations are codified at 53-17-1 to 53-17-20 NMSA 1978, and do not contain a dissolution provision that is inconsistent with Rule 1-017 NMRA. Thus defendant, a foreign corporation, is subject to the New Mexico statutes which are specific to foreign corporations rather than to 53-16-24 NMSA 1978, which controls the dissolution of New Mexico corporations. Therefore, Delaware law controls whether defendant is amenable to suit following dissolution.Smith v. Halliburton Co., 1994-NMCA-055, 118 N.M. 179, 879 P.2d 1198.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part I,\" see 1 Nat. Res.

Reed, 1967-NMSC-261, 78 N.M. 554, 434 P.2d 376 (decided under former law).\n\nForeign public utility has power of eminent domain.— Under 62-1-1 and 62-1-4 NMSA 1978, a foreign public utility authorized to do business in this state has the same right as a domestic public utility to exercise the power of eminent domain in this state.El Paso Elec. Co. v. Real Estate Mart, Inc., 1979-NMSC-023, 92 N.M. 581, 592 P.2d 181.See now62-1-1.1 NMSA 1978 (decided under prior law).\n\nThe Business Corporation Act does not compel a foreign corporation to consent to general personal jurisdiction.— In consolidated interlocutory appeals where the district court denied petitioners' motions to dismiss claims against them for lack of general or specific personal jurisdiction, and where the court of appeals concluded that general personal jurisdiction was proper over petitioners, four foreign corporations, all of whom are manufacturers of automobiles or automobile components and registered to transact business under New Mexico's Business Corporation Act (BCA), §§ 53-17-1 through 53-17-20 NMSA 1978, the New Mexico supreme court reversed the court of appeals because any legislative intent to require a foreign corporation to consent to general personal jurisdiction should be clearly, unequivocally, and unambiguously expressed in the statutory text, and the language of the BCA relating to a foreign corporation's equal rights and responsibilities under New Mexico law does not clearly, unequivocally, and unambiguously express an intent to require a foreign corporation to consent to general personal jurisdiction in New Mexico.Chavez v.

Trailmobile Co., 1955-NMSC-004, 59 N.M. 73, 279 P.2d 526.\n\nThe Business Corporation Act does not compel a foreign corporation to consent to general personal jurisdiction.— In consolidated interlocutory appeals where the district court denied petitioners' motions to dismiss claims against them for lack of general or specific personal jurisdiction, and where the court of appeals concluded that general personal jurisdiction was proper over petitioners, four foreign corporations, all of whom are manufacturers of automobiles or automobile components and registered to transact business under New Mexico's Business Corporation Act (BCA), §§ 53-17-1 through 53-17-20 NMSA 1978, the New Mexico supreme court reversed the court of appeals because any legislative intent to require a foreign corporation to consent to general personal jurisdiction should be clearly, unequivocally, and unambiguously expressed in the statutory text, and the language of the BCA relating to a foreign corporation's equal rights and responsibilities under New Mexico law does not clearly, unequivocally, and unambiguously express an intent to require a foreign corporation to consent to general personal jurisdiction in New Mexico.Chavez v.
