Any person who releases information contrary to the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) nor less than one hundred dollars ($100) or by imprisonment in the county jail not more than ninety days nor less than thirty days or by both fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the judge.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 51-21-8, enacted by Laws 1959, ch. 181, § 8; 1961, ch. 152, § 2; 1977, ch. 103, § 8; 2001, ch. 200, § 31.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nLaws 2013, ch. 75, § 9 provided that as of July 1, 2013, the secretary of state, pursuant to N.M. const., Art. 11, § 19, shall assume responsibility for chartering corporations as provided by law, including the performance of the functions of the former corporations bureau of the public regulation commission, and that except for Subsection D of 53-5-8 NMSA 1978, references to the \"public regulation commission\", \"state corporation commission\" or \"commission\" shall be construed to be references to the secretary of state.See8-4-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, substituted \"public regulation commission\" for \"state corporation commission\" in the section heading and Subsection A; inserted \"public regulation\" preceding \"commission\" throughout the section; updated the internal reference in Subsection C; in Subsection E, substituted \"the revenue processing division of the taxation and revenue department\" for \"bureau of revenue\" and \"revenue processing division shall be subject\" for \"bureau shall be subject\"; and deleted \"concerning the release of such information contrary to law by any person in the requesting agency or department\" from the end of Subsection F.\n\nExamination of reports filed prior to effective date of act.— As to reports filed previous to the effective date of the Corporate Reports Act, the corporation commission (now secretary of state) has no power to permit the examination of such reports except under the circumstances set out in 51-13-11, 1953 Comp. (repealed by Laws 1959, ch. 181, § 10), i.e., at a hearing of the commission or of any court under the provisions of the act. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen.

The date of forfeiture or reinstatement of a corporation's right to do business in New Mexico for failure to pay franchise tax is public information, may be disclosed to interested parties and is not part of 53-5-2B NMSA 1978 data. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-104 (rendered under former law).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 18 Am. Jur. 2d Corporations § 15.\n\n19 C.J.S. Corporations § 542.",
