The indemnification may include any amounts paid to satisfy a judgment or to compromise or settle a claim. The director or officer shall not be indemnified if he shall be adjudged to be liable on the basis that he has breached or failed to perform the duties of his office and the breach or failure to perform constitutes willful misconduct or recklessness. Advance indemnification may be allowed of a director or officer for reasonable expenses to be incurred in connection with the defense of the action, suit or proceeding, provided that the director or officer shall reimburse the association if it is subsequently determined that the director or officer was not entitled to indemnification. Each association may make any other indemnification as authorized by the articles of incorporation or bylaws or by a resolution adopted after notice by the members entitled to vote. As used in this section, \"director\" means any person who is or was a director of the association and any person who, while a director of the association, is or was serving at the request of the association as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of any foreign or domestic corporation or nonprofit corporation, cooperative, partnership, joint venture, trust, other incorporated or unincorporated enterprise or employee benefit plan or trust.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 53-4-9.1, enacted by Laws 1987, ch. 238, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For indemnification of officers and directors,see53-8-26 NMSA 1978.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Statutory Adoption of Several Liability in New Mexico: A Commentary and Quasi-Legislative History,\" see 18 N.M.L.
