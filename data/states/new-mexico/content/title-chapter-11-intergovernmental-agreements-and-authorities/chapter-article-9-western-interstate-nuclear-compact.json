      "text": "The Western Interstate Nuclear Compact is entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in a form substantially as follows:\n\nWESTERN INTERSTATE NUCLEAR COMPACT\n\nArticle 1. Policy and purpose. — The party states recognize that the proper employment of scientific and technological discoveries and advances in nuclear and related fields and direct and collateral application and adaptation of processes and techniques developed in connection therewith, properly correlated with the other resources of the region, can assist substantially in the industrial progress of the west and the further development of the economy of the region. They also recognize that optimum benefit from nuclear and related scientific or technological resources, facilities and skills requires systematic encouragement, guidance, assistance and promotion from the party states on a cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis. It is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort in nuclear and related fields, to enhance the economy of the west and contribute to the individual and community well-being of the region's people.\n\nArticle 2. The board. — A. There is hereby created an agency of the party states to be known as the \"western interstate nuclear board,\" hereinafter called the board. The board shall be composed of one member from each party state designated or appointed in accordance with the law of the state which he represents and serving and subject to removal in accordance with such law. Any member of the board may provide for the discharge of his duties and the performance of his functions thereon, either for the duration of his membership or for any lesser period of time, by a deputy or assistant, if the laws of his state make specific provisions therefor. The federal government may be represented without vote if provision is made by federal law for such representation.\n\nB. The board members of the party states shall each be entitled to one vote on the board. No action of the board shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of all members representing the party states are present and unless a majority of the total number of votes on the board are cast in favor thereof.\n\nC. The board shall have a seal.\n\nD. The board shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice chairman and a treasurer. The board shall appoint and fix the compensation of an executive director who shall serve at its pleasure and who shall also act as secretary, and who, together with the treasurer and such other personnel as the board may direct, shall be bonded in such amounts as the board may require.\n\nE. The executive director, with the approval of the board, shall appoint and remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the board's functions irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states.\n\nF. The board may establish and maintain, independently or in conjunction with any one or more of the party states, or its institutions or subdivisions, a suitable retirement system for its full-time employees. Employees of the board shall be eligible for social security coverage in respect of old age and survivors insurance provided that the board takes such steps as may be necessary pursuant to federal law to participate in such program of insurance as a governmental agency or unit. The board may establish and maintain or participate in such additional programs of employee benefits as may be appropriate.\n\nG. The board may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any state or the United States or any subdivision or agency thereof, from any interstate agency or from any institution, person, firm or corporation.\n\nH. The board may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services, conditional or otherwise, from any state or the United States or any subdividion [subdivision] or agency thereof, or interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the same.

The board annually shall make to the governor of each party state a report covering the activities of the board for the preceding year, and embodying such recommendations as may have been adopted by the board, which report shall be transmitted to the legislature of said state. The board may issue such additional reports as it may deem desirable.\n\nArticle 3. Finances. — A. The board shall submit to the governor or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that jurisdiction for presentation to the legislature thereof.\n\nB. Each of the board's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. Each of the board's requests for appropriations pursuant to a budget of estimated expenditures shall be apportioned equally among the party states. Subject to appropriation by their respective legislatures, the board shall be provided with such funds by each of the party states as are necessary to provide the means of establishing and maintaining facilities, a staff of personnel and such activities as may be necessary to fulfill the powers and duties imposed upon and entrusted to the board.\n\nC. The board may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under Article 2 H of this compact, provided that the board takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to the incurring of any obligation to be met in whole or in part in this manner.

The board may formulate and, in accordance with need from time to time, revise a regional plan or regional plans for coping with nuclear incidents within the territory of the party states as a whole or within any subregion or subregions of the geographic area covered by this compact. Any nuclear incident plan in force pursuant to this paragraph shall designate the official or agency in each party state covered by the plan who shall coordinate requests for aid pursuant to Article 6 of this compact and the furnishing of aid in response thereto. Unless the party states concerned expressly otherwise agree, the board shall not administer the summoning and dispatching of aid, but this function shall be undertaken directly by the designated agencies and officers of the party states. However, the plan or plans of the board in force pursuant to this paragraph shall provide for reports to the board concerning the occurrence of nuclear incidents and the requests for aid on account thereof, together with summaries of the actual working and effectiveness of mutual aid in particular instances.

No party state or its officers or employees rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission on their part while so engaged, or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith.\n\nD. All liability that may arise either under the laws of the requesting state or under the laws of the aiding state or under the laws of a third state on account of or in connection with a request for aid, shall be assumed and borne by the requesting state.\n\nE. Any party state rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of, any equipment answering a request for aid and for the cost of all materials, transportation, wages, salaries and maintenance of officers, employees and equipment incurred in connection with such requests; provided that nothing herein contained shall prevent any assisting party state from assuming such loss, damage, expense or other cost or from loaning such equipment or from donating such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost.\n\nF.

Any such agreement shall specify the purpose or purposes, its duration and the procedure for termination thereof or withdrawal therefrom, the method of financing and allocating the costs of the activity or project and such other matters as may be necessary or appropriate. No such supplementary agreement entered into pursuant to this article shall become effective prior to its submission to and approval by the board. The board shall give such approval unless it finds that the supplementary agreement or activity or project contemplated thereby is inconsistent with the provisions of this compact or a program or activity conducted by or participated in by the board.\n\nB. Unless all of the party states participate in a supplementary agreement, any cost or costs thereof shall be borne separately by the states party thereto. However, the board may administer or otherwise assist in the operation of any supplementary agreement.\n\nC.

Eligible parties; entry into force and withdrawal. — A. Any or all of the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming shall be eligible to become party to this compact.\n\nB. As to any eligible party state, this compact shall become effective when its legislature shall have enacted the same into law; provided, that it shall not become initially effective until enacted into law by five states.\n\nC. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until two years after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.\n\nD. Guam and American Samoa, or either of them, may participate in the compact to such extent as may be mutually agreed by the board and the duly constituted authorities of Guam or American Samoa, as the case may be. However, such participation shall not include the furnishing or receipt of mutual aid pursuant to Article 6, unless that article has been enacted or otherwise adopted so as to have the full force and effect of law in the jurisdiction affected. Neither Guam nor American Samoa shall be entitled to voting participation on the board unless it has become a full party to the compact.\n\nArticle 10. Severability and construction. — The provisions of this compact and of any supplementary agreement entered into hereunder shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact or such supplementary agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact or such supplementary agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact or any supplementary agreement entered into hereunder shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact or such supplementary agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters. The provisions of this compact and of any supplementary agreement entered into pursuant thereto shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes thereof.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 4-34-1, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 40, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— States which have adopted the Western Interstate Nuclear Compact include: Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.",
