The interstate commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children. If the interstate commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of that compact, or the powers granted under that compact, then such an action by the interstate commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.\n\nB. Rules shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the \"Model State Administrative Procedure Act\" (1981), Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000) as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the interstate commission.\n\nC.

The court shall give deference to the actions of the interstate commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the interstate commission's authority.\n\nD. If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children, then the rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.\n\nOVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\nA.

A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.\n\nE. Suspension or termination of membership in the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and each of the member states.\n\nF.

The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children and its promulgated rules and bylaws against a member state in default. The venue for the action shall be consistent with the determination in other interstate compacts to which the state of New Mexico is a member under the laws of the state of New Mexico.\n\nM. The remedies in the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children shall not be the exclusive remedies of the interstate commission. The interstate commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or under the regulation of a profession.\n\nFINANCING OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION\n\nA. The interstate commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activities.\n\nB. The interstate commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the interstate commission and its staff that must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the interstate commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states.\n\nC. The interstate commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the obligations; nor shall the interstate commission pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by and with the authority of the member state.\n\nD. The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws.

The interstate commission may propose amendments to the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children for enactment by the member states.
