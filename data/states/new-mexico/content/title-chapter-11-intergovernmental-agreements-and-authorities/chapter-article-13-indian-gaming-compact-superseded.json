      "text": "Compiler's notes.— Section 11-13-1 NMSA 1978 enacted into law the Indian Gaming Compact of 1997. In 2001, the State of New Mexico entered into a new gaming compact that superseded the 1997 compact.SeeR & R Deli, Inc. v. Santa Ana Star Casino, 2006-NMCA-020, 139 N.M. 85, 128 P.3d 513, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-002, 139 N.M. 339, 132 P.3d 596. The Indian Gaming Compact of 2001 expires on June 30, 2015.See2001 Tribal-State Class III Gaming Compact Between the State of New Mexico and the Pueblos of Acoma, Isleta, Laguna, Sandia, San Felipe, San Juan, Santa Ana, Santa Clara, Taos and Tesuque and the Jicarilla Apache Nation, Section 12(A).\n\nIn 2007, the State of New Mexico entered into a new Indian gaming compact with many of the tribes that were signatories of the 2001 compact. The 2001 compact became null and void for those tribes that entered into the 2007 Indian Gaming Compact.See2007 Tribal-State Class III Gaming Compact Between the State of New Mexico and the Pueblos of Isleta, Laguna, Nambe, Ohkay Owingeh (Pueblo of San Juan), Picuris, San Felipe, Sandia, Santa Ana, Santa Clara, Taos, and Tesuque, Section 9(D). The 2007 compact expires on June 30, 2037.See2007 Indian Gaming Compact, Section 12(A).\n\nIn 2015, the State of New Mexico entered into a new Indian gaming compact.See2015 Tribal-State Class III Gaming Compact (Approved by Laws 2015, S.J.R. No. 19). The 2015 Indian gaming compact fully supplants and replaces any predecessor agreements between the State of New Mexico and any Indian tribe that is a signatory of the 2015 Indian Gaming Compact.See2015 Indian Gaming Compact, Section 9(A). The 2015 compact expires on June 30, 2037.See2015 Indian Gaming Compact, Section 12(A).\n\nWorkers' compensation claims.— Where worker was injured during the course of worker's employment by an Indian tribe at a ski run that was operated by the Indian tribe, and in the Indian Gaming Compact, the tribe agreed to provide all of its employees workers' compensation benefits at least as favorable as those provided by comparable state programs, the Indian tribe did not waive its sovereign immunity with respect to workers' compensation disputes and the state workers' compensation judge lacked subject matter jurisdiction of worker's claim.Antonio v. Inn of the Mountain Gods Resort & Casino, 2010-NMCA-077, 148 N.M. 858, 242 P.3d 425, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-007, 148 N.M. 610, 241 P.3d 611.\n\nInjured patron common law dramshop liability.— Where plaintiff alleged that defendant sold alcohol to decedents at a social function at an Indian casino despite the decedents' intoxication and, as a result, the decedents were killed in a single vehicle accident, and a third person, who was a passenger in the back seat of the vehicle, was injured; the police and the passenger were unable to determine which of the decedents was driving the vehicle at the time of the accident; plaintiff was licensed by the Indian tribe to sell and serve alcoholic beverages at the casino; and the Indian tribe had enacted an ordinance which prohibited the sale of alcohol to intoxicated persons, plaintiff stated an injured, third-party common law negligence claim against defendant on behalf of whichever decedent was driving.Mendoza v. Tamaya Enters., Inc., 2010-NMCA-074, 148 N.M. 534, 238 P.3d 903, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-007, 148 N.M. 610, 241 P.3d 611.\n\nInjured, third-party common law dramshop liability.— Where plaintiff alleged that defendant sold alcohol to decedents at a social function at an Indian casino despite the decedents' intoxication and, as a result, the decedents were killed in a single vehicle accident, and a third person, who was a passenger in the back seat of the vehicle, was injured; the police and the passenger were unable to determine which of the decedents was driving the vehicle at the time of the accident; plaintiff was licensed by the Indian tribe to sell and serve alcoholic beverages at the casino; and the Indian tribe had enacted an ordinance which prohibited the sale of alcohol to intoxicated persons, plaintiff stated an injured, third-party common law negligence claim against defendant on behalf of whichever decedent was not driving.Mendoza v. Tamaya Enters., Inc., 2010-NMCA-074, 148 N.M. 534, 238 P.3d 903, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-007, 148 N.M. 610, 241 P.3d 611.\n\nDistrict court jurisdiction over common law dramshop liability claims.— Where defendant sold alcohol to decedents at a social function at an Indian casino despite the decedents' intoxication and, as a result, the decedents were killed in a single vehicle accident; plaintiff was licensed by the Indian tribe to sell and serve alcoholic beverages at the casino; and pursuant to the Indian Gaming Compact, the Indian tribe had enacted an ordinance which prohibited the sale of alcohol to intoxicated persons, waived sovereign immunity in connection with claims for compensatory damages for bodily injury or property damage, and agreed that any claim could be brought in district court, the district court had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of the action.Mendoza v. Tamaya Enters., Inc., 2010-NMCA-074, 148 N.M. 534, 238 P.3d 903, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-007, 148 N.M. 610, 241 P.3d 611.\n\nTribes indispensable parties to Indian gaming legislation challenge.— Dismissal of an action attacking the legality of legislation authorizing Indian gaming in New Mexico (11-13-1 and 11-13-2 NMSA 1978) was required because the plaintiffs cannot join certain indispensable parties, namely the various tribes and pueblos that have gaming compacts with the state.State ex rel. Coll v. Johnson, 1999-NMSC-036, 128 N.M. 154, 990 P.2d 1277.\n\nStanding to challenge the compact.— State, legislators, private citizens and nonprofit corporation did not have standing as beneficially interested parties or under the great public importance doctrine to challenge the legality of legislation authorizing Indian gaming.State ex rel. Coll v. Johnson, 1999-NMSC-036, 128 N.M. 154, 990 P.2d 1277.\n\nSovereign immunity not waived.— Where plaintiff sued defendant for breach of contract, prima facie tort, and violation of the Unfair Practices Act because defendant refused to pay plaintiff a gambling prize; defendant was a casino that was a wholly-owned, operated, and unincorporated enterprise of defendant; and defendant was a party to the tribal-state Class III Gaming Compact, sovereign immunity barred plaintiff's claims and the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.Hoffman v. Sandia Resort and Casino, 2010-NMCA-034, 148 N.M. 222, 232 P.3d 901, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-003, 148 N.M. 560, 240 P.3d 15, cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 227, 178 L.Ed.2d 135 (2010).\n\nWaiver of sovereign immunity for bodily injury or property damagein a tribal-state Class III Gaming Compact cannot be construed to mean or include emotional injury resulting from the invasion of privacy rule.Holguin v. Tsay Corp., 2009-NMCA-056, 146 N.M. 346, 210 P.3d 243.\n\nImmunity from suit for emotional injury.— Where the plaintiff, who sued the defendant for emotional injuries resulting from the invasion of the plaintiff's privacy, claimed that the plaintiff won a random drawing for $250,000 at the defendant's casino; that the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the full $250,000 and instead required the plaintiff to elect to receive half of the $250,000, less income taxes, or an annuity valued at $250,000 payable over twenty years; and that the defendant falsely advertised the plaintiff as winning the full $250,000 and used the plaintiff's likeness and name for the defendant's benefit and where the defendant was party to a tribal-state Class III Gaming Compact which contained a limited waiver of tribal sovereign immunity with respect to claims for damages for bodily injury or property damage, the waiver of immunity cannot be construed to mean or include emotional injury resulting from application of the invasion of privacy rule.Holguin v. Tsay Corp., 2009-NMCA-056, 146 N.M. 346, 210 P.3d 243.\n\nJurisdiction over personal injury actions.— State courts have jurisdiction over personal injury actions filed against pueblos arising from negligent acts alleged against casinos owned and operated by the pueblos and occurring on pueblo land.Doe v. Santa Clara Pueblo, 2007-NMSC-008, 141 N.M. 269, 154 P.3d 644.\n\nDram shop liability.— Where decedents attended a wedding reception at a Pueblo casino where decedents were served alcoholic beverages and became intoxicated; casino employees continued to serve alcohol to decedents despite their apparent intoxication; decedents left the casino and were killed when their vehicle left the road and rolled over; decedents' estates filed wrongful death actions in state district court; the casino was licensed to sell alcohol by the Pueblo; the service of alcohol to decedents while they were intoxicated violated the Pueblo liquor ordinance; the ordinance reserved exclusive jurisdiction over violations of the ordinance in tribal courts; and in Section 8 of the Tribal-State Class III Gaming Compact (2001) the Pueblo agreed to state court jurisdiction of claims involving injuries proximately caused by the conduct of the casino, the state district court had jurisdiction over the case.Mendoza v. Tamaya Enters., Inc., 2011-NMSC-030, 150 N.M. 258, 258 P.3d 1050,aff'g2010-NMCA-074, 148 N.M. 534, 238 P.3d 903.\n\nProspective application.— The 1997 compact between a tribe and the state is to be applied prospectively only and not have retroactive application.Gallegos v. Pueblo of Tesuque, 2002-NMSC-012, 132 N.M. 207, 46 P.3d 668, cert. dismissed, 536 U.S. 990, 123 S. Ct. 32, 153 L. Ed. 2d 894 (2002).\n\n2001 compact.— The 2001 gaming compact superceded the 1997 gaming compact.R & R Deli, Inc. v. Santa Ana Star Casino, 2006-NMCA-020, 139 N.M. 85, 128 P.3d 513, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-002, 139 N.M. 339, 132 P.3d 596.\n\nThe 2001 gaming compact's reference to \"persons who suffer bodily injury\" supports the conclusion that the waiver of sovereign immunity was intended to cover only claims for physical injuries to persons and property and not claims which involve contract law and business torts.R & R Deli, Inc. v. Santa Ana Star Casino, 2006-NMCA-020, 139 N.M. 85, 128 P.3d 513, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-002, 139 N.M. 339, 132 P.3d 596.\n\nCompact meets requirements for joinder of insurer.The Indian Gaming Compact satisfies all three factors of the test for joinder of an insurer, because the language of Paragraph B of Section 8 unequivocally requires insurance coverage, the title of section 8, \"Protection of Visitors\", reflects that one of the compact's purposes is to protect the general public, and the compact contains no express negation of joinder.Romero v. Pueblo of Sandia, 2003-NMCA-137, 134 N.M. 553, 80 P.3d 490.\n\nPurposes of compact.Because the Indian Gaming Compact has wide-ranging goals, it does not follow that any purposes outside of the \"Purpose and Objectives\" section of the compact are rendered incidental.Romero v. Pueblo of Sandia, 2003-NMCA-137, 134 N.M. 553, 80 P.3d 490.\n\nApproval of compacts under Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.— In order for class III Indian gaming operations to be valid under The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq.): the state and the tribe must have \"entered into\" a compact and the compact must be \"in effect\" pursuant to secretarial approval and notice; state law determines the procedures by which a state may validly enter into a compact; and in determining whether the state and the tribes have entered into valid and binding compacts under New Mexico law the New Mexico Supreme Court decision ofState ex rel. Clark v. Johnson,1995-NMSC-048, 120 N.M. 562, 904 P.2d 11 controls.Pueblo of Santa Ana v. Kelly, 104 F.3d 1546 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 807, 118 S. Ct. 45, 139 L. Ed. 2d 11 (1997).\n\nGaming commission immune from suit.— Under the Indian Gaming Compact, the governmental actions of a gaming commission in regulating gaming are distinguishable from the commercial activities of a gaming enterprise. Plaintiff, whose loss of his gaming license is alleged to have been caused by the improper governmental action of a gaming commission, lacks standing to assert the waiver of immunity in Section 8 of the Indian Gaming Compact, which is limited to victims whose injuries are caused by the conduct of the gaming enterprise.Kosiba v. Pueblo of San Juan, 2006-NMCA-057, 139 N.M. 533, 135 P.3d 234, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-003, 139 N.M. 352, 132 P.3d 1038.\n\nExpansion of Class II gaming for non-tribal horse racetrack.— Neither the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 2701 - 2721, nor the 2001 and 2007 Indian gaming compacts affect the legislature's authority to authorize Class II gaming activities outside of Indian lands and if authorized by the legislature, a non-tribal horse racetrack can engage in Class II gaming activities without violating the terms of the compacts. 2013 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13-02.\n\nThe expansion of Class III gaming for non-tribal horse racetracks beyond the currently authorized activities of betting on live horse racing, horse race simulcasting, slot machines and similar gaming machines requires legislative authorization and, if granted, will terminate the gaming tribes' revenue-sharing obligations under the 2001 and 2007 Indian gaming compacts. 2013 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13-02.\n\nLimits on arbitration.— An arbitration panel selected under Section 7 of the compact could not change or invalidate the regulatory fees specified in Paragraph E(5) of Section 4. 1999 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 99-02.\n\nIf the revenue sharing agreement, codified at former 11-3-2 NMSA 1978, is covered by Section 7 of the compact, the arbitration panel would not have authority to determine the legal validity of the revenue-sharing amount. 1999 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 99-02.",

      "text": "The governor is authorized to execute a revenue-sharing agreement in the form substantially set forth in this section with any New Mexico Indian nation, tribe or pueblo that has also entered into an Indian gaming compact as provided by law. Execution of an Indian gaming compact is conditioned upon execution of a revenue-sharing agreement. The consideration for the Indian entity entering into the revenue-sharing agreement is the condition of the agreement providing limited exclusivity of gaming activities to the tribal entity. The revenue-sharing agreement shall be in substantially the following form and is effective when executed by the governor on behalf of the state and the appropriate official of the Indian entity:\n\n\"REVENUE-SHARING AGREEMENT\n\n1. Summary and consideration. The Tribe shall agree to contribute a portion of its Class III Gaming revenues identified in and under procedures of this Revenue-Sharing Agreement, in return for which the State agrees that the Tribe:\n\nA. has the exclusive right within the State to provide all types of Class III Gaming described in the Indian Gaming Compact, with the sole exception of the use of Gaming Machines, which the State may permit on a limited basis for racetracks and veterans' and fraternal organizations; and\n\nB. will only share that part of its revenue arising from the use of Gaming Machines and all other gaming revenue is exclusively the Tribe's.\n\n2. Revenue to State. The parties agree that, after the effective date hereof, the Tribe shall make the quarterly payments provided for in Paragraph 3 of the Revenue Sharing Agreement to the state treasurer for deposit into the General Fund of the State (\"State General Fund\").\n\n3. Calculation of Revenue to State.\n\nA. As used in this Revenue-Sharing Agreement, \"net win\" means the annual total amount wagered at a Gaming Facility on Gaming Machines less the following amounts:\n\n(1) the annual amount paid out in prizes from gaming on Gaming Machines;\n\n(2) the actual amount of regulatory fees paid to the state; and\n\n(3) the sum of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) per year as an amount representing tribal regulatory fees, with these amounts increasing by five percent (5%) each year beginning on the first day of January occurring after the Compact has been in effect for at least twelve months.\n\nB. The Tribe shall pay the state sixteen percent (16%) of the net win.\n\nC. For purposes of these payments, all calculations of amounts due shall be based upon the quarterly activity of the gaming facility. Quarterly payments due to the State pursuant to these terms shall be paid no later than twenty-five (25) days after the last day of each calendar quarter. Any payments due and owing from the Tribe in the quarter the Compact is approved, or the final quarter the Compact is in force, shall reflect the net win, but only for the portion of the quarter the Compact is in effect.\n\n4. Limitations. The Tribe's obligation to make the payments provided for in Paragraphs 2 and 3 of this section shall apply and continue only so long as there is a binding Indian Gaming Compact in effect between the Tribe and the State, which Compact provides for the play of Class III Gaming, but shall terminate in the event of any of the following conditions:\n\nA. If the State passes, amends, or repeals any law, or takes any other action, which would directly or indirectly attempt to restrict, or has the effect of restricting, the scope of Indian gaming.\n\nB. If the State permits any expansion of nontribal Class III Gaming in the State. Notwithstanding this general prohibition against permitted expansion of gaming activities, the State may permit: (1) the enactment of a State lottery, (2) any fraternal, veterans or other nonprofit membership organization to operate such electronic gaming devices lawfully, but only for the benefit of such organization's members, (3) limited fundraising activities conducted by nonprofit tax exempt organizations pursuant to Section 30-19-6 NMSA 1978, and (4) any horse racetracks to operate electronic gaming devices on days on which live or simulcast horse racing occurs.\n\n5. Effect of Variance. In the event the acts or omissions of the State cause the Tribe's obligation to make payments under Paragraph 3 of this section to terminate under the provisions of Paragraph 4 of this section, such cessation of obligation to pay will not adversely affect the validity of the Compact, but the amount that the Tribe agrees to reimburse the State for regulatory fees under the Compact shall automatically increase by twenty percent (20%).\n\n6. Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended to create any third-party beneficiaries and is entered into solely for the benefit of the Tribe and the State.\"\n\nNew Mexico Gaming Control BoardCOMPACT COMPLIANCE CHECKLISTCompliance ReportFiscal Year 20\n\nKey: X Compliance (Blank) Non-Compliance/ Partial Compliance NA Non Applicable\n\nCompliancewith Section\n\nTribal-StateCompact\n\nCompliancewith Section\n\nTribal-StateCompact\n\nCompliance with Section\n\nTribal-State Compact\n\n[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]\n\nSection 3.
