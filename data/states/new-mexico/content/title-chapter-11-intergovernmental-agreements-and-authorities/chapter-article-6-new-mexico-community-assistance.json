      "text": "A. The development of infrastructure needs of local communities, including but not limited to water, sewage treatment, power, transportation and communication, is a prerequisite to economic development in all areas of the state. Local communities cannot finance these infrastructure needs alone because of inadequate bonding capacity, lag time between development and the generation of revenue and the dependency of economic development on an adequate infrastructure.\n\nB. The legislature finds and declares that, to aid local communities in providing adequate, safe and sanitary services, a community assistance program is needed, particularly for those communities faced with rapid growth or loss of their tax base. A council should be created to review proposals submitted by political subdivisions and to allocate funding from several sources, including severance tax bonds as approved and issued by the state board of finance, community development block grants from the federal government and such other sources of funding as the legislature may specify from time to time for financing needed projects for local community infrastructure development.\n\nC. In order to maximize the utilization of various sources of funding, the legislature designates the local government division of the department of finance and administration as the central clearinghouse and administering and coordinating agency for state and federally funded programs for local community infrastructure development to provide for a common application and funding cycle, promote efficiency, prevent confusion and duplication and limit paperwork for communities seeking assistance.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 11-6-2, enacted by Laws 1984, ch. 5, § 2.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1984, ch. 5, § 2, repealed former 11-6-2 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1983, ch. 298, § 1, and enacted a new section.\n\nCross references.— For local government division of the department of finance and administration,see6-6-2 NMSA 1978.",
