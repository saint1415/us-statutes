      "text": "A. All appeals and writs of error in criminal cases have the effect of a stay of execution of the sentence of the district court until the decision of the supreme court or court of appeals.\n\nB. If a defendant is convicted of a capital or violent offense and is sentenced to death or a term of imprisonment not suspended in whole, he shall not be entitled to release pending appeal.\n\nC. If a defendant is convicted of a noncapital offense other than a violent offense and is sentenced to a term of imprisonment not suspended in whole, he shall not be entitled to release pending appeal unless the court finds:\n\n(1) by clear and convincing evidence that the person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released; and\n\n(2) that the appeal is not for the purpose of delay and raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial.\n\nD. As used in Subsections B and C of this section, \"violent offense\" means:\n\n(1) kidnaping;\n\n(2) criminal sexual penetration in the first or second degree;\n\n(3) armed robbery;\n\n(4) murder in the second degree;\n\n(5) aggravated burglary;\n\n(6) aggravated arson; or\n\n(7) assault with intent to commit violent felony upon peace officer.\n\nE. In all parole and probation revocation proceedings, where the alleged violation by the parolee or probationer of the conditions of release poses a threat to himself or others, the defendant shall not be entitled to be released on bail pending the decision on revocation. In those instances where the state has failed to conduct a preliminary parole revocation hearing on a parolee held for parole violations within sixty days of arrest, the parolee shall be eligible for bail. In all cases, the final parole revocation hearing shall be scheduled for hearing within sixty days of the parolee's return to the penitentiary. In the case of probation violation, if the final probation revocation hearing is not brought before the court within sixty days, then the probationer shall be eligible for bail.\n\nHistory:Laws 1917, ch. 43, § 58; 1927, ch. 93, § 10; C.S. 1929, § 105-2532; 1941 Comp., § 42-1502; 1953 Comp., § 41-15-2; Laws 1966, ch. 28, § 59; 1981, ch. 232, § 1; 1988, ch. 3, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For rule of criminal procedure regarding release during trial, and release pending sentence, motion for new trial and appeal,seeRule 5-402 NMRA.\n\nFor similar appellate rule,seeRule 12-207 NMRA.\n\nFor writs of error,seeRule 12-503 NMRA.\n\nThe 1988 amendment,effective February 12, 1988, rewrote former Subsection B and redesignated it as Subsection E, and added present Subsections B, C and D.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 1988, ch. 3, § 2, effective February 12, 1988, provides that the provisions of the act apply only to persons convicted for crimes committed on or after its effective date.\n\nRule 5-805 NMRA does not violate separation of powers.— Subsection H of Rule 5-805 NMRA, which requires dismissal of a probation violation proceeding if the time limits to hold an adjudicatory hearing are not met, does not infringe upon the substantive rights granted by the legislature in Sections 31-11-1 and 31-21-15 NMSA 1978 and does not violate the separation of powers doctrine.State v. Montoya, 2011-NMCA-009, 149 N.M. 242, 247 P.3d 1127, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-001, 150 N.M. 558, 263 P.3d 900.\n\nNo federal constitutional violations by denial of waiver.— Defendant's waiver of supersedeas was properly denied where he agreed to serve time on his sentence pending appeal because he was unable to make appeal bond, and denial was not a violation of defendant's constitutional rights under the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const., amend. XIV.State v. Ramirez, 1966-NMSC-042, 76 N.M. 72, 412 P.2d 246.\n\nEffect of writs of error at common law.— At common law, a writ of error was not a supersedeas so as to discharge custody, but in capital cases it operated to stay execution.Borrego v. Territory, 1896-NMSC-011, 8 N.M. 446, 46 P. 349.\n\nDefendant not obligated to make restitution during appeal.— A defendant is under no legal duty, except moral, perhaps, to make any restitution during the pendency of his appeal.State v. Cordova, 1983-NMCA-144, 100 N.M. 643, 674 P.2d 533.\n\nWaiver of supersedeas.— There is no provision under New Mexico law for a waiver of supersedeas. State v. Ramirez, 1966-NMSC-042, 76 N.M. 72, 412 P.2d 246.\n\nPending appeal, safekeeping of prisoner sheriff's duty.— Pending appeal, the judge has no power to order one under sentence to be committed to penitentiary for safekeeping. The power of removal is in the hands of the sheriff, who is charged with safekeeping the prisoner.Parks v. Hughes, 1918-NMSC-094, 24 N.M. 421, 174 P. 425.\n\nState solely responsible for cost of maintenance of convict.— When convict under sentence of death is, under this statute, confined in state penitentiary, pending determination of his appeal, state has entire jurisdiction over such convict and cannot recover cost of his maintenance from county.State v. Board of Comm'rs, 1939-NMSC-059, 43 N.M. 521, 96 P.2d 290.\n\nDistrict court abused its discretion in requiring corporate suretyto the exclusion of individual sureties on a property bond.State v. Lucero, 1970-NMCA-057, 81 N.M. 578, 469 P.2d 727.\n\nFiling notice of appeal does not divest district court of jurisdiction to hold probation revocation hearing or revoke probation.State v. Rivera, 2004-NMSC-001, 134 N.M. 768, 82 P.3d 939.\n\nProbationer's sentence runs during pendency of appeal.— Nowhere in this section has the legislature expressly prohibited a probationer's sentence from running during the pendency of his or her appeal; moreover, the primary goal of probation, defendant rehabilitation, could be defeated by delaying the commencement of a defendant's probationary sentence pending appeal.State v. Rivera, 2004-NMSC-001, 134 N.M. 768, 82 P.3d 939.\n\nSection intended to function as appellate bail bond statute.— If the execution of a defendant's sentence was automatically stayed once he or she appealed, then the defendant would have had no need for a statutory right to post an appeal bond. State v. Rivera, 2004-NMSC-001, 134 N.M. 768, 82 P.3d 939.\n\nIf a defendant remains on probation during the pendency of his or her appeal, an appeal bond becomes unnecessary because the defendant is already submitting to the punishment that an appeal bond would be fashioned to prevent the defendant from attempting to evade; thus, one of the primary purposes of this section as a whole preventing the defendant from avoiding the consequences of his or her conviction and sentence is inapplicable once the defendant is placed on probation.State v. Rivera, 2004-NMSC-001, 134 N.M. 768, 82 P.3d 939.\n\nSubsection C(2) is constitutional.— The appeal-bond statute does not unduly burden or interfere with the New Mexico's courts responsibilities, and thus, the statute is constitutional.State v. House, 1996-NMCA-052, 121 N.M. 784, 918 P.2d 370, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 676, 916 P.2d 1343.\n\nRelease under this section is mandatory where defendants meet all of the requirements of Subsection C.— When defendants satisfy the conditions of § 31-11-1(C) NMSA 1978, the plain language of the statute entitles them to release subject to the conditions of release imposed by the trial court.State v. Taylor, 2021-NMSC-023.\n\nDefendants, having met all required conditions, were entitled to release pending appeal.— Where defendants, operators of a day care center, were convicted of two counts of child abuse after they failed to remove two children from a hot vehicle, which resulted in the death of one child and serious neurological injuries to the other child, and where, following trial, defendants established that they were not dangerous or a flight risk and raised substantial questions as to whether there was substantial evidence establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that they recklessly disregarded the risk that the children would suffer great bodily harm or death when they failed to remove the children from the vehicle and as to whether the jury instruction properly reflected the legal theories presented to allow the jury to make an informed and unanimous decision, the district court erred in denying defendants' petition for release pending the resolution of their appeal, because defendants satisfied all the required conditions of § 31-11-1(C) NMSA 1978. Both issues raised by the defendants constitute substantial questions that if resolved in their favor would result in reversal or an order for a new trial.State v. Taylor, 2021-NMSC-023.\n\nMeaning of \"substantial question\".— A \"substantial question\" under Subsection C(2) is a question that is more than not frivolous.State v. House, 1996-NMCA-052, 121 N.M. 784, 918 P.2d 370, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 676, 916 P.2d 1343.\n\nTest for post-conviction bail.— Bail pending appeal is appropriate if, assuming that the \"substantial question\" is determined favorably to defendant on appeal, that \"substantial question\" decision is likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial on all counts on which imprisonment has been imposed.State v. House, 1996-NMCA-052, 121 N.M. 784, 918 P.2d 370.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —8 Am. Jur. 2d Bail and Recognizance § 15 et seq; 21 Am.

      "text": "In any criminal case, if the supreme court or court of appeals affirms the judgment of the district court upon review brought by the defendant, it shall direct that the sentence pronounced be executed; and if the judgment is reversed, it shall direct a new trial or that the defendant be absolutely discharged according to the circumstances of the case.\n\nHistory:Laws 1917, ch. 43, § 55; 1927, ch. 93, § 8; C.S. 1929, § 105-2529; 1941 Comp., § 42-1505; 1953 Comp., § 41-15-5; Laws 1966, ch. 28, § 60.\n\nCross references.— For similar appellate rule,seeRule 12-402 NMRA.\n\nSupreme court's affirmance of execution not repealed by implication.— Statute providing that on affirmance of conviction, supreme court shall direct execution was not repealed by implication as to capital cases by statute providing for order of execution by district court.Woo Dak San v. State, 1931-NMSC-056, 36 N.M. 53, 7 P.2d 940.\n\nWhen supreme court affirms decision without further investigation.— Where brief for defendant upon appeal contained such an unwarranted attack upon the trial judge, his conduct, rulings, and instructions, as to amount to a scandalous and impertinent attack upon the judiciary, supreme court was warranted in striking the brief and argument from the files, and affirming the decision without further investigation.Tomlinson v. Territory, 1893-NMSC-017, 7 N.M. 195, 33 P. 950.\n\nNotice not required as condition precedent to commitment order.— With the issuance of mandate by the appellate court, the district court is directed to issue a commitment order. Accordingly, the district court is not required to give notice to the defendant, his attorney, or his bondsmen as a condition precedent to the issuance of the commitment order.In re Martinez, 1982-NMSC-115, 99 N.M. 198, 656 P.2d 861.\n\nRemand for new sentence instead of new trial.— Appellate courts have the authority to remand a case for entry of judgment on the lesser included offense and resentencing rather than retrial when the evidence does not support the offense for which the defendant was convicted but does support a lesser included offense. The rationale for this holding is that there is no need to retry a defendant for a lesser included offense when the elements of a lesser offense necessarily were proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt in the course of convicting the defendant of the greater offense.State v. Haynie, 1994-NMSC-001, 116 N.M. 746, 867 P.2d 416.\n\nCourt of appeals lacks authority to modify contempt sentence.State v. Sanchez, 1976-NMCA-104, 89 N.M. 673, 556 P.2d 359.\n\nAm.

Nelson, 1959-NMSC-023, 65 N.M. 403, 338 P.2d 301, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 877, 80 S. Ct. 142, 4 L. Ed. 2d 115.\n\nDistrict court retries and reexamines all fact issues.— Since a vast majority of judicial pronouncements relative to a new trial state that it is a reexamination of an issue of fact in the same court, the legislature, by enacting this section, did not intend to provide that the trial judge who had presided over the original trial without objection could be ousted of jurisdiction to retry the case. Nor does this statutory provision contemplate a new information or indictment, rearrest or a new preliminary hearing. This section simply means that the district court to which any case is remanded for a new trial shall reexamine and retry all issues of fact.State v. Nelson, 1959-NMSC-023, 65 N.M. 403, 338 P.2d 301, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 877, 80 S. Ct. 142, 4 L.

Neither the wording nor the title of the act of which this section is a part suggests in any manner that it applies to the admissibility of evidence upon retrial.State v.

A motion for such relief may be made at any time.\n\nB. Unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the district attorney of the judicial district in which such motion is pending, appoint local counsel if the prisoner is indigent, grant a prompt hearing therein, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto. If the court finds that the judgment was rendered without jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law, or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack, the court shall vacate and set the judgment aside and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him, or grant a new trial, or correct the sentence, as may appear appropriate.\n\nC.

An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief by motion to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention, or that a habeas corpus proceeding is pending at the effective date of this section.\n\nG. This section shall not apply to municipal or justice of the peace courts [magistrate courts].\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-15-8, enacted by Laws 1966, ch. 29, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Section 21-2-1(5), 1953 Comp., referred to in Subsection E, was Rule 5 of the \"Supreme Court Rules.\" The \"Supreme Court Rules\" were superseded by rules adopted by the supreme court in 1973, 1974 and 1975. For present, similar provisions,seeRule 12-201 NMRA. Rule 1-093 NMRA was superseded by Rule 5-802 NMRA as to all motions for post-conviction relief filed on or after September 1, 1975.\n\nThe office of justice of the peace has been abolished, and the jurisdiction, powers and duties have been transferred to the magistrate court.See35-1-38 NMSA 1978.\n\nHabeas corpus.— An inmate may not resort to this section when the relief sought can be obtained directly by writ of habeas corpus and a habeas corpus petitioner is not required to first seek relief by a post-conviction remedy motion before seeking a writ of habeas corpus.Cummings v. State, 2007-NMSC-048, 142 N.M. 656, 168 P.3d 1080.\n\nPreemption by Rule 5-802 NMRA.— This section has been preempted by Rule 5-802 NMRA, which governs the procedure for filing a writ of habeas corpus.State v. Peppers, 1990-NMCA-057, 110 N.M. 393, 796 P.2d 614, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 260, 794 P.2d 734.\n\nConflicts controlled by Rule 5-802 NMRA.— This section does not provide a post-conviction remedy to the extent that it conflicts with N.M.R. Crim. P. 57 (now Rule 5-802 NMRA).State v. Garcia, 1984-NMCA-009, 101 N.M. 232, 680 P.2d 613, cert. quashed, 101 N.M. 189, 679 P.2d 1287.\n\nGenerally.— In a post-conviction proceeding, the issue is not the guilt or innocence of the prisoner; the issue is the validity of the conviction.State v. Ramirez, 1967-NMSC-210, 78 N.M. 418, 432 P.2d 262 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nSixth amendment right to counsel inapplicable.— Right to counsel provided by the U.S. Const., amend. VI does not apply to post-conviction relief proceedings.State v. Ramirez, 1967-NMSC-210, 78 N.M. 418, 432 P.2d 262 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nAbsent constitutional requirement, appointment of counsel within court's discretion.State v. Ramirez, 1967-NMSC-210, 78 N.M. 418, 432 P.2d 262 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nProceeding independent civil action before criminal procedure rules enacted.— Prior to enactment of criminal procedural rules, a Rule 1-093 NMRA or proceeding under this section was an independent civil action, and, therefore, Rule 1-052 NMRA, requiring the making of findings of fact, applied to such proceedings.State v. Hardy, 1967-NMSC-203, 78 N.M. 374, 431 P.2d 752 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nDefinition of \"conclusive\".— The term \"conclusive\" means \"beyond question,\" \"beyond dispute,\" or \"so irrefutable as to end all uncertainty or question.\"State v. Sanchez, 1966-NMCA-002, 78 N.M. 25, 420 P.2d 786 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nClaims for relief must be specific.— Where defendant does not in any way specify or particularize claimed vital points, claimed errors or claimed discrepancies, a mere allegation of incompetence of attorney or inefficiency is not ground for relief.State v. Crouch, 1967-NMSC-093, 77 N.M. 657, 427 P.2d 19 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nDefendant must allege some factual basis for relief sought.— Vague conclusional charges do not raise an issue which demands an inquiry.State v. Sexton, 1968-NMCA-003, 78 N.M. 694, 437 P.2d 155;State v. Williams, 1967-NMSC-224, 78 N.M. 431, 432 P.2d 396 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nDenial or absence of counsel is issue raisable on collateral attack.State v. Hardy, 1967-NMSC-203, 78 N.M. 374, 431 P.2d 752 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5 802 NMRA).\n\nMotion to vacate sentence.— Motion to vacate sentence which raised no new grounds for relief not raised in previous habeas corpus proceeding was properly found to be repetitious, even though transcript of habeas corpus proceeding was never admitted into evidence.Lott v. State, 1967-NMSC-073, 77 N.M. 612, 426 P.2d 588 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nWhat motion to vacate includes.— A petitioner is not entitled upon a motion to vacate a sentence to have his case retried on the facts, and only rarely may he raise questions of law which could have been raised by appeal.State v. Selgado, 1967-NMSC-147, 78 N.M. 165, 429 P.2d 363 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nNo basis for relief where claim of entrapment.— A claim of entrapment does not state a basis for post-conviction relief.State v. Simien, 1968-NMSC-025, 78 N.M. 709, 437 P.2d 708;State v. Apodaca, 1967-NMSC-218, 78 N.M. 412, 432 P.2d 256 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nOr where mere allegation of perjury.— A mere allegation of perjury does not entitle defendant to post-conviction relief. A charge of perjury, which neither names or identifies the witnesses who committed the perjury nor specifies the claimed false statements, is not sufficient basis for relief.State v. Crouch, 1967-NMSC-093, 77 N.M. 657, 427 P.2d 19 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nOr conclusion that due process denied.— A mere conclusion that due process was denied is not sufficient basis for relief.State v. Crouch, 1967-NMSC-093, 77 N.M. 657, 427 P.2d 19 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nOr credibility of witness.— Credibility of a witness does not provide a ground for post-conviction relief.State v. Williams, 1967-NMSC-224, 78 N.M. 431, 432 P.2d 396 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nOr general claim that attorney was pro formarather than zealous and active does not provide a basis for post-conviction relief.State v. Apodaca, 1967-NMSC-218, 78 N.M. 412, 432 P.2d 256 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nOr where dissatisfaction with results obtainedthrough the efforts of attorney does not provide a basis for post-conviction relief.State v. Apodaca, 1967-NMSC-218, 78 N.M. 412, 432 P.2d 256 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nRepresentation at preliminary hearing affords no basis for relief.— Claim that defendant was entitled to counsel when he appeared before the magistrate states no basis for post-conviction relief where defendant was represented by counsel at preliminary hearing.State v. Apodaca, 1967-NMSC-218, 78 N.M. 412, 432 P.2d 256 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nOr where record shows adequate representation.— Claim that defendant is unlearned, has little education and \"did not fully understand everything that made up his trial\" does not set forth a basis for relief, where the record on the trial and the direct appeal shows that his attorneys protected his rights.State v. Williams, 1967-NMSC-224, 78 N.M. 431, 432 P.2d 396 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nOr that counsel fails to advise defendant of potential appeal.— Where defendant's motion does not assert that any official in New Mexico's system of justice rejected a request for counsel or failed to take steps toward appointment of counsel after having knowledge of defendant's indigency and desire for counsel on appeal, nor does the motion assert that defendant made any request to be furnished appellate counsel, the claim that counsel did not advise defendant that he could appeal as an indigent does not set forth a basis for post-conviction relief.State v. Raines, 1967-NMCA-026, 78 N.M. 579, 434 P.2d 698 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nOr complaint with attorney's trial tactics.— The petitioner is not entitled to post-conviction relief on the grounds that the result might have been different if different trial tactics and strategy had been employed as where the petitioner discussed a change of venue with his attorney because of certain publicity, and that after consideration, his counsel decided against seeking the change. He cannot now complain of that decision.State v. Selgado, 1967-NMSC-147, 78 N.M. 165, 429 P.2d 363 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nClaims concerning procedure afford no basis for relief.— Where, at the time defendant's suspended sentence was revoked, the statutory procedure was not followed, but the record shows that counsel was present with defendant at the time of the revocation, that neither the defendant nor his counsel had any objections to the procedure that was in fact followed and defendant, in response to the court's question, stated that he did not desire further hearing on the motion to revoke the suspended sentence, this is a claim concerning the conduct of the proceeding and how it was managed and it does not set forth a basis for relief.State v. Raines, 1967-NMCA-026, 78 N.M. 579, 434 P.2d 698 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nNo grounds for relief where factual questions already resolved.— Whether defendant was properly tried for first-degree murder rather than voluntary manslaughter are factual questions which the jury resolved by its verdict and present no grounds for relief.State v. Williams, 1967-NMSC-224, 78 N.M. 431, 432 P.2d 396 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nTime for appointing counsel.— Once, however, the prisoner alleges some factual basis raising a substantial issue, counsel must be appointed.State v. Ramirez, 1967-NMSC-210, 78 N.M. 418, 432 P.2d 262 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nNo counsel appointed when motion groundless.— Where a motion has been filed in a post-conviction proceeding, but is completely groundless, counsel need not be appointed to represent the defendant.State v. Ramirez, 1967-NMSC-210, 78 N.M. 418, 432 P.2d 262 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nOr when prisoner explores possibility of motion.— Where the conviction has been affirmed on direct review, the trial court is not required to appoint counsel to assist the prisoner in exploring the possibilities for post-conviction relief.State v. Ramirez, 1967-NMSC-210, 78 N.M. 418, 432 P.2d 262 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nNot enough to show indigency hampered employment of counsel.— For a petitioner to be entitled to post-conviction relief, it is not enough to show that indigency occasioned the petitioner's inability to employ counsel or to appeal; the petitioner must show that the state deprived him of his fourteenth amendment rights. State action is shown when a responsible official in the state's system of justice rejects a request for counsel or fails to take proper steps toward appointment of counsel for a convicted defendant when he has knowledge of the defendant's indigency and desire for appellate counsel.State v. Raines, 1967-NMCA-026, 78 N.M. 579, 434 P.2d 698 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nWhere motion groundless, court under no duty to appoint counsel.— Where the motion for post-conviction relief is completely groundless, the trial court need not appoint counsel to represent defendant in connection with the motion and may determine the motion without the presence of defendant.State v. Sanchez, 1966-NMCA-002, 78 N.M. 25, 420 P.2d 786 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nWaiver of prior defects bars post-conviction relief.— Absent a showing of prejudice, the plea at arraignment waived prior defects in the proceedings. Here, while prejudice is claimed, it is not shown. Thus, defendant fails to set forth a basis for post-conviction relief.State v. Robinson, 1967-NMSC-220, 78 N.M. 420, 432 P.2d 264 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nIllegal arrest not ground for attacking judgment.— Claim of illegal arrest, in itself, is not a proper ground for attacking a judgment under post-conviction remedy.State v. Gibby, 1967-NMSC-219, 78 N.M. 414, 432 P.2d 258 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nSuccessive motions.— It is within the discretion of the trial court either to grant or deny successive motions.Lott v. State, 1967-NMSC-073, 77 N.M. 612, 426 P.2d 588 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5 802 NMRA).\n\nSubsequent application.— If doubts arise in particular cases as to whether the grounds in a subsequent application are different, they should be resolved in favor of the applicant.State v. Canales, 1967-NMSC-221, 78 N.M. 429, 432 P.2d 394 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nBurden on applicant to show need for redetermination.— The burden is on the applicant to show that, although the ground of the new application was determined against him on the merits of a prior application, the ends of justice would be served by a redetermination of the ground.State v. Canales, 1967-NMSC-221, 78 N.M. 429, 432 P.2d 394 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nNo redetermination of trial issues.— Where the extent of defendant's drinking was an issue at the trial, it is not to be redetermined in a post-conviction proceeding.State v. Williams, 1967-NMSC-224, 78 N.M. 431, 432 P.2d 396 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nRefusal of application.— A second or successive application may be refused only if the prior denial rested on an adjudication of the merits of the ground presented in the subsequent application. This means that an evidentiary hearing must have been held in the prior application if factual issues were raised and it was not denied on the basis that the files and records conclusively resolved those issues.State v. Canales, 1967-NMSC-221, 78 N.M. 429, 432 P.2d 394 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nRemedy not intended as substitute for appeal.— Post-conviction proceedings are not intended for, or to be utilized as a substitute for appeal as a means of correcting errors occurring during the course of a trial, or to get reconsideration of matters considered on appeal.State v. Williams, 1967-NMSC-224, 78 N.M. 431, 432 P.2d 396 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nFiling of notice of appeal jurisdictional.— The timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional and if it has not been complied with, in the absence of excusable neglect, the court is bound to act on its own motion and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, even though the parties do not raise the question of jurisdiction.State v. Weddle, 1967-NMSC-027, 77 N.M. 417, 423 P.2d 609 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nIssues decided on appeal not relitigated.— Issue concerning prior convictions and the state's use of an \"F.B.I. rap sheet\" was raised and decided on defendant's appeal and may not be relitigated in post-conviction proceedings.State v. Williams, 1967-NMSC-224, 78 N.M. 431, 432 P.2d 396 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nAttack on district court's conclusion of law must fail.— Where there is conflict in appellant's attack on the district court's conclusion of law, that appellant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily, while being advised by competent counsel, entered a plea of guilty, must fail.State v. Simien, 1968-NMSC-025, 78 N.M. 709, 437 P.2d 708 (decided prior to adoption of Rule 5-802 NMRA).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Habeas Corpus in New Mexico,\" see 11 N.M.L.
