II, § 10) and former statute were to be considered in pari materia, their general purpose being preservation of personal security and liberty of individual, by forbidding issuance of a warrant except upon probable cause shown under oath, and by preventing as far as possible the institution of baseless and unfounded prosecution.State v. Trujillo, 1928-NMSC-016, 33 N.M. 370, 266 P. 922.\n\nComplaint subscribed by sheriff was insufficient to invoke jurisdictionof district court where crimes charged therein, burglary and grand larceny, purported in each case to be a felony.State v.

Barreras, 1958-NMSC-085, 64 N.M. 300, 328 P.2d 74.\n\nWarrant valid.— A warrant based upon a detective's information and belief affidavit and approved in writing by the assistant district attorney was valid.State v. Slicker, 1968-NMCA-085, 79 N.M. 677, 448 P.2d 478.\n\nWhen no warrant required.— Under former 41-3-8, 1953 Comp., the issuance of a warrant was not necessary to confer jurisdiction over the person of an accused who had already been arrested with probable cause and who was under confinement.State v. Barreras, 1958-NMSC-085, 64 N.M. 300, 328 P.2d 74.\n\nArrest of both defendant and party named in warrant upheld.— Arrest was proper where defendant was in company of party for whom arresting officer had warrant and officer had been advised that party for whom he had warrant was accompanied by man answering defendant's description when alleged acts were committed.State v.

Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, a peace officer may arrest a person and take that person into custody without a warrant when the officer is at the scene of a domestic disturbance and has probable cause to believe that the person has committed an assault or a battery upon a household member. As used in this section, \"household member\" means a spouse, former spouse, family member, including a relative, parent, present or former step-parent, present or former in-law, child or co-parent of a child, or a person with whom the victim has had a continuing personal relationship. Cohabitation is not necessary to be deemed a household member for purposes of this section.\n\nB. No peace officer shall be held criminally or civilly liable for making an arrest pursuant to this section, provided he acts in good faith and without malice.\n\nC.

Almanzar, 2014-NMSC-001,rev'g2012-NMCA-111, 288 P.3d 238.\n\nWhere defendant and the victim began quarreling in a parking lot; defendant kicked the victim; and the police arrested defendant for domestic violence at a store across the street from the parking lot within minutes after the victim called 911, defendant's warrantless arrest was lawful under Section 31-1-7(A) NMSA 1978 because the arrest was make in close proximity to when and where the incident occurred.State v.
