Rodriguez, 1972-NMCA-148, 84 N.M. 355, 503 P.2d 335.\n\nMultiple representation.— While it is incontestable that a criminal defendant is entitled to representation, there is no support for the argument that more than one attorney must be appointed to represent an indigent defendant based merely on the claim that a case is complex and a conviction would carry serious consequences to the defendant.State v. Chamberlain, 1991-NMSC-094, 112 N.M. 723, 819 P.2d 673.\n\nCounsel need not be notified before defendant questioned about unrelated offense.— Where an accused has been charged with one offense and is represented by counsel with respect to that offense, police need not notify that counsel before questioning defendant about another unrelated offense.State v.

      "text": "A. A needy person who is being detained by a law enforcement officer, or who is under formal charge of having committed, or is being detained under a conviction of, a serious crime, is entitled to be represented by an attorney to the same extent as a person having his own counsel and to be provided with the necessary services and facilities of representation, including investigation and other preparation. The attorney, services and facilities and expenses and court costs shall be provided at public expense for needy persons.\n\nB. A needy person entitled to representation by an attorney under Subsection A is entitled to be:\n\n(1) counseled and defended at all stages of the matter beginning with the earliest time when a person providing his own counsel would be entitled to be represented by an attorney;\n\n(2) represented in any appeal or review proceedings; and\n\n(3) represented in any other postconviction proceeding that the attorney or the needy person considers appropriate unless the court in which the proceeding is brought determines that it is not a proceeding that a reasonable person with adequate means would be willing to bring at his own expense.\n\nC. A needy person's right to a benefit under this section is unaffected by his having provided a similar benefit at his own expense, or by his having waived it, at an earlier stage.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-22-3, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 69, § 60.\n\nLegislative intent.— The legislature did not intend current implementation of the Indigent Defense Act to come from any other source of funds than the public defender department.State v. Brown, 2004-NMCA-037, 135 N.M. 291, 87 P.3d 1073, cert. granted, 135 N.M. 321, 88 P.3d 263,rev'd, 2006-NMSC-023, 139 N.M. 466, 134 P.3d 753.\n\nRight to basic tools of an adequate defense.— Funding for expert witnesses should extend to those indigent defendants represented by pro bono counsel, in addition to those represented by the public defender department.State v. Brown, 2006-NMSC-023, 139 N.M. 466, 134 P.3d 753,rev'g2004-NMCA-037, 135 N.M. 291, 87 P.3d 1073.\n\nConstitution grants accused right to representation.— New Mexico Const., art. II, § 14, gives the accused the right to be defended by counsel. When the offense with which the defendant is charged is punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, the court is required to assign counsel \"if the prisoner has not the financial means to procure counsel.\"State v. Anaya, 1966-NMSC-144, 76 N.M. 572, 417 P.2d 58.\n\nAbsent waiver, pauper charged with crime entitled to counsel.— Absent competent and intelligent waiver, a person charged with crime in a state court who is a pauper and unable to employ counsel is entitled to have an attorney appointed to defend him.State v. Dalrymple, 1965-NMSC-124, 75 N.M. 514, 407 P.2d 356.\n\nShowing of indigency required.— A showing of an accused's indigency is a prerequisite to the right of court-appointed counsel.State v. Powers, 1965-NMSC-046, 75 N.M. 141, 401 P.2d 775.\n\nCourt entitled to make defendant show need.— A showing of an accused's indigency is a prerequisite to the right of a court-appointed counsel and it is proper for the trial court to require the defendant to make a reasonable showing that he is unable to employ counsel.State ex rel. Peters v. McIntosh, 1969-NMSC-103, 80 N.M. 496, 458 P.2d 222.\n\nCourt must make sufficient inquiry.— When defendant makes a reasonable showing of indigency in support of his request for court-appointed counsel, the trial court has a duty to inquire into the facts claimed by defendant. This does not require an independent inquiry by the court. It does require sufficient questioning by the court to enable the court either to decide the question of indigency at that time or to direct that defendant is to report further to the court on the question of obtaining counsel.State v. Anaya, 1966-NMSC-144, 76 N.M. 572, 417 P.2d 58.\n\nWhen a defendant makes a reasonable showing of indigency, the trial court has a duty to inquire into the facts relied upon by the defendant.State v. Watchman, 1991-NMCA-010, 111 N.M. 727, 809 P.2d 641, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 529, 807 P.2d 227,overruled on other grounds byState v. Hosteen, 1996-NMCA-084, 122 N.M. 228, 923 P.2d 595.\n\nBurden of proceeding rests first upon defendant.— It is proper for the trial court to require defendant to make a reasonable showing that he is unable to employ counsel. Depending on the facts, more than one inquiry may be necessary.State v. Anaya, 1966-NMSC-144, 76 N.M. 572, 417 P.2d 58.\n\nDoubts resolved in accused's favor.— Although the courts recognize the relative concepts of indigency and that this determination should be made at the trial court level, the opinions indicate that doubts as to indigency should be resolved in favor of the accused.State ex rel. Peters v. McIntosh, 1969-NMSC-103, 80 N.M. 496, 458 P.2d 222.\n\nEffect of refusal to fill out certificate of indigency.— Defendant was not entitled to any appointed counsel because he refused to fill out, under oath, a certificate of indigency showing his income, and thus there was no showing that he was a needy person.State v. Pina, 1977-NMCA-020, 90 N.M. 181, 561 P.2d 43.\n\nNo counsel provided prior to claim of indigency.— Defendant does have a right to be represented by counsel, but the trial court has no obligation to provide defendant with counsel prior to any claim of indigency.State v. Deats, 1971-NMCA-089, 82 N.M. 711, 487 P.2d 139.\n\nAttorney provided before preliminary hearing.— This section would provide an attorney for a needy person who is being detained by a law enforcement officer, and this could be before the preliminary hearing.State ex rel. Peters v. McIntosh, 1969-NMSC-103, 80 N.M. 496, 458 P.2d 222.\n\nAbsent waiver, preliminary hearing without counsel present invalid.— The determination of the question of indigency must often be made before the otherwise normal appearance of the accused before the district court. To hold a preliminary hearing without counsel present, unless the right to counsel has been competently, intelligently and voluntarily waived, vitiates the hearing.State ex rel. Peters v. McIntosh, 1969-NMSC-103, 80 N.M. 496, 458 P.2d 222.\n\nClaim of inadequate representationby court-appointed counsel requires a showing that the proceedings leading to his conviction were a sham, farce or mockery.State v. Salazar, 1970-NMCA-056, 81 N.M. 512, 469 P.2d 157.\n\nRepresentation must be more than pro forma appearance.— The representation to which a defendant is entitled is something more than a pro forma appearance.State v. Dalrymple, 1965-NMSC-124, 75 N.M. 514, 407 P.2d 356.\n\nAppointment of counsel lies within court's discretion.— An indigent defendant may not compel the court to appoint such counsel as defendant may choose. Such appointment lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. Likewise, whether the dissatisfaction of an indigent accused with his court-appointed counsel warrants discharge of that counsel and appointment of new counsel is for the trial court, in its discretion, to decide.State v. Salazar, 1970-NMCA-056, 81 N.M. 512, 469 P.2d 157.\n\nIndigent Defense Act does not provide for payment of advances.State v. Frazier, 1973-NMCA-127, 85 N.M. 545, 514 P.2d 302.\n\nMotion for advancement of funds for investigator properly denied.— Defendant's motion for a prior advancement of funds for a professional investigator was properly denied as an expenditure is clearly not required in every case and need not be provided unless the necessity is shown.State v. Frazier, 1973-NMCA-127, 85 N.M. 545, 514 P.2d 302.\n\nFree polygraph examination refused to \"indigent\".— Where defendant sought by motion an order committing the state to pay for a polygraph examination before the examination was conducted, alleging that defendant was indigent, thus presumably invoking the provisions of the Indigent Defense Act, but although trial counsel was court-appointed the only reference to indigency was in defendant's various motions, not in orders of the court, and also appearing in defendant's motions were allegations that defendant had employment and could return to that employment if released on bail, the record did not support the claim that defendant was indigent when he sought a free polygraph examination and thus this subsection did not apply.State v. Carrillo, 1975-NMCA-103, 88 N.M. 236, 539 P.2d 626.\n\nUncontested motion for determination of indigency.— When a defendant's motion for determination of indigency is uncontested, the better procedure in such cases is for the trial court to either grant the motion or to expressly indicate the basis for its denial.State v. Watchman, 1991-NMCA-010, 111 N.M. 727, 809 P.2d 641, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 529, 807 P.2d 227,overruled on other grounds byState v. Hosteen, 1996-NMCA-084, 122 N.M. 228, 923 P.2d 595.\n\nState must afford indigents record of proceedings.— It is not a requirement that a certified copy of a court reporter's notes of the proceedings be always furnished but that the state must afford indigents a record of sufficient completeness to permit proper consideration of their claims and a tape recording of preliminary examination proceedings in a magistrate's court is sufficient.State ex rel. Moreno v. Floyd, 1973-NMSC-117, 85 N.M. 699, 516 P.2d 670.\n\nAppointment of additional attorneys.— Where two or more defendants were jointly charged with a felony, the language of former 41-11-2, 1953 Comp., did not require any construction denying to a court the power to appoint attorneys for each jointly charged indigent defendant as the circumstances should appear. Indeed, if a prejudicial conflict of interest arose or if the number of defendants being represented and divergence in defenses would reduce the attorneys' effectiveness the court was required to appoint additional attorneys. 1966 Op.

Upon commencement of any later judicial proceeding relating to the same matter, the presiding officer shall clearly inform the person so detained or charged of the right of a needy person to be represented by an attorney at public expense.\n\nC.

      "text": "A. The determination of whether a person covered by Section 60 [31-16-3 NMSA 1978] of the Indigent Defense Act is a needy person shall be deferred until his first appearance in court or in a suit for payment or reimbursement under Section 66 [31-16-9 NMSA 1978] of the Indigent Defense Act, whichever occurs earlier. Thereafter, the court concerned shall determine, with respect to each proceeding, whether he is a needy person.\n\nB. In determining whether a person is a needy person and the extent of his inability to pay, the court concerned may consider such factors as income, property owned, outstanding obligations and the number and ages of his dependents. Release on bail does not necessarily prevent him from being a needy person. In each case, the person shall, subject to the penalties for perjury, certify in writing or by other record material factors relating to his ability to pay as the court prescribes.\n\nC. To the extent that a person covered by Section 60 of the Indigent Defense Act is able to provide for an attorney, the other necessary services and facilities of representation and court costs, the court may order him to provide for their payment.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-22-5, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 69, § 62.\n\nCross references.— For jury and witness fee fund,see34-9-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nDetermination fails to meet constitutional mandate.— The limited determination of indigency under the standard of pauperism does not conform to constitutional mandate.Anaya v. Baker, 427 F.2d 73 (10th Cir. 1970).\n\nProper to require defendant to make reasonable showing of indigency.— A showing of an accused's indigency is a prerequisite to the right of a court-appointed counsel, and it is proper for the trial court to require the defendant to make a reasonable showing that he is unable to employ counsel.State ex rel. Peters v. McIntosh, 1969-NMSC-103, 80 N.M. 496, 458 P.2d 222.\n\nDoubts resolved in favor of accused.— Although the courts recognize the relative concepts of indigency and that this determination should be made at the trial court level, doubts as to indigency should be resolved in favor of the accused.State ex rel. Peters v. McIntosh, 1969-NMSC-103, 80 N.M. 496, 458 P.2d 222.\n\nRight of district court to determine indigency.— Although this rule makes it the duty of the district court to appoint counsel for the indigent person immediately upon receipt of a certificate of indigency from the committing magistrate, we do not construe this as depriving the district court of its right to determine whether such person is in fact indigent.State ex rel. Peters v. McIntosh, 1969-NMSC-103, 80 N.M. 496, 458 P.2d 222.\n\nCourt must make adequate inquiry into whether person needy.— Whether defendant has the financial means to procure counsel is a factual question. This factual question cannot be resolved without an adequate inquiry into the facts.State v. Anaya, 1966-NMSC-144, 76 N.M. 572, 417 P.2d 58.\n\nWhen a defendant makes a reasonable showing of indigency, the trial court has a duty to inquire into the facts relied upon by the defendant.State v.

To hold a preliminary hearing without counsel present, unless the right to counsel has been competently, intelligently and voluntarily waived, vitiates the hearing.State ex rel. Peters v. McIntosh, 1969-NMSC-103, 80 N.M. 496, 458 P.2d 222.\n\nCourt determination obligates public defender.— The legislature, understanding that courts determine indigence under the Indigent Defense Act (IDA), enacted 31-15-10 NMSA 1978 of the Public Defender Act (PDA) intending \"every person without counsel who is financially unable to obtain counsel\" to include all persons who courts determine are \"needy\" under the 31-16-5 NMSA 1978 of the IDA. Therefore, under the administrative system of the PDA and IDA, when a court determines that a defendant is \"needy,\" the defendant is \"financially unable to obtain counsel\" under the PDA, and the department \"shall represent\" the defendant pursuant to 31-15-10 NMSA 1978, assuming the defendant is charged with a crime carrying a possible sentence of imprisonment.State ex rel. Quintana v. Schnedar, 1993-NMSC-033, 115 N.M. 573, 855 P.2d 562.\n\nConstruction with Public Defender Act.— The Indigent Defense Act and the Public Defender Act are consistent as amended: The IDA obligates courts to determine indigence, the PDA directs the department to adopt standards for determining indigence, and other statutes instruct courts to employ those standards.State ex rel. Quintana v. Schnedar, 1993-NMSC-033, 115 N.M. 573, 855 P.2d 562.\n\nClaim of indigency in letter form sufficient.— If in fact defendant was indigent at time of filing notice of appeal, he was entitled to be represented by court-appointed counsel on his appeal; his letter stating he cannot pay costs is a sufficient claim of indigency.Barela v. State, 1970-NMCA-044, 81 N.M. 433, 467 P.2d 1005.\n\nEffect of refusal to fill out certificate of indigency.— Defendant was not entitled to any appointed counsel because he refused to fill out, under oath, a certificate of indigency showing his income, and thus there was no showing that he was a needy person.State v. Pina, 1977-NMCA-020, 90 N.M. 181, 561 P.2d 43.\n\nBorrowing ability one factor in determining financial means.— Neither the ability nor the inability to borrow money is the sole criterion. The question is whether defendant has the financial means to employ counsel. Borrowing ability is only one aspect of the defendant's \"financial means.\"State v. Anaya, 1966-NMSC-144, 76 N.M. 572, 417 P.2d 58.\n\nAs well as property interest and employment.— The fact that defendant had an undefined interest in three items of property and the fact that he was employed prior to his arrest is insufficient to determine the question of defendant's financial ability to obtain counsel.State v. Anaya, 1966-NMSC-144, 76 N.M. 572, 417 P.2d 58.\n\nRepresented by employed counsel, but still indigent.— A defendant may be represented by employed counsel and still be indigent in connection with other matters pertaining to defense of the case.State v. Apodaca, 1969-NMCA-038, 80 N.M. 244, 453 P.2d 764.\n\nMandamus is not available to control judicial discretionunless there is a clear abuse of that discretion, or unless such action would prevent the doing of useless things.State ex rel. Peters v. McIntosh, 1969-NMSC-103, 80 N.M. 496, 458 P.2d 222.\n\nUncontested motion for determination of indigency.— When a defendant's motion for determination of indigency is uncontested, the better procedure in such cases is for the trial court to either grant the motion or to expressly indicate the basis for its denial.State v. Watchman, 1991-NMCA-010, 111 N.M. 727, 809 P.2d 641, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 529, 807 P.2d 227,overruled on other grounds byState v. Hosteen, 1996-NMCA-084, 122 N.M. 228, 923 P.2d 595.\n\nAm.

Maldonado, 1985-NMSC-115, 103 N.M. 570, 711 P.2d 15.\n\nEffective waiver of right to counsel.— Where both the justice of the peace and the district court advised defendant that, if indigent, counsel would be appointed to represent him, where defendant affirmatively waived counsel in both courts and where the district court questioned defendant extensively as to his understanding of the charges, the penalties if convicted, his various rights, including the right to counsel, to a jury trial and to an appeal if found guilty, then defendant's motion for post-conviction relief on the grounds of lack of counsel was denied, as defendant effectively waived his right to counsel.State v.

Ulmer, 2001-NMCA-105, 131 N.M. 350, 36 P.3d 441.\n\nStatutory fee not violative of constitutional rights.— Defendant's argument that the statutory attorney fee limitation of $400 in defense of indigent criminal cases was a denial of equal protection and due process was without merit where there was no claim that the defendant was poorly represented, nor were there any facts indicating how the statutory fee limitation so deprived the defendant.State v. Silver, 1971-NMCA-112, 83 N.M. 1, 487 P.2d 910.\n\nConstitutionality of flat-fee arrangements for indigent defense contract counsel.— Where the New Mexico legislature, in its 2015 general appropriation to the law office of the public defender (LOPD), specifically provided that the appropriations to the public defender department shall not be used to pay hourly reimbursement rates to contract attorneys, the district court erred in entering an order requiring the LOPD to pay contract counsel hourly rates and the state to provide additional funding, nullifying the legislature's prohibition of the payment of hourly rates to indigent defense contract counsel as violative of the federal and state constitutions, based on its conclusion that the flat-fee rates paid to contract counsel by the LOPD contravene the constitutional guarantee of effective assistance of counsel; an indigent criminal defendant who is represented by contract counsel who is compensated under a flat-fee arrangement does not necessarily receive ineffective assistance of counsel.Kerr v. Parsons, 2016-NMSC-028.\n\nLegislature may appropriate additional funds.— Language in Subsection A (2) providing that expenses under the Indigent Defense Act are to be paid from \"funds appropriated to the district court with respect to all stages of proceedings initiated in the district court\" does not prevent the legislature from appropriating additional funds for expenses in indigent cases.State v.
