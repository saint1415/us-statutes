      "text": "The district judge may convene one or more grand juries at any time, without regard to court terms. A grand jury shall serve for a period of no longer than three months. The district judge shall summon and qualify as a panel for grand jury service such number of jurors as he deems necessary. Each grand jury shall be composed of twelve regular jurors and a sufficient number of alternates to insure the continuity of the inquiry and the taking of testimony. All deliberations shall be conducted by any twelve jurors, comprised of regular jurors or substituted alternates. No more than twelve jurors may deliberate. No juror may vote on an indictment unless the juror has heard all evidence presented on the charge. The district judge may discharge or excuse members of a grand jury and substitute alternate grand jurors as necessary. The names of jurors summoned for grand jury service shall be drawn from the master jury wheel of the district court for the county.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-5-1, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 1; 1981, ch. 262, § 1; 1983, ch. 62, § 1.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 14, repealed former 41-5-1, 1953 Comp., relating to right to challenge grand jury.\n\nThe 1983 amendmentinserted \"regular\" in the fourth sentence, added \"and a sufficient number of alternates to insure the continuity of the inquiry and the taking of testimony\" at the end of the fourth sentence and inserted the fifth and sixth sentences.\n\nSelection of a grand jury must be under the control of the district court.— The district court is the constitutionally and statutorily designated neutral entity that is assigned the responsibility for determining which grand jurors sit in any particular case to decide the question of indictment. The district court may not delegate its core statutory responsibilities over grand jury proceedings.De Leon v. Hartley, 2014-NMSC-005.\n\nWhere, after the orientation and swearing of the grand jurors, the district court transferred the process of selecting and excusing jurors to the district attorney's office without further apparent involvement by the district court; the list of grand jurors used by the district attorney's office contained notations that suggested that someone in the district attorney's office excused several grand jurors; and the district court found that there was no fraud or prejudice to defendant in the conduct of the grand jury proceeding and denied defendant's pretrial motion to quash the indictment, the district court should have quashed the indictment irrespective of whether any actual fraud or prejudice was established when the improper involvement of the district attorney in the excusal of grand jurors was brought to the attention of the district court.De Leon v. Hartley, 2014-NMSC-005.\n\nRemedy for irregularities in the grand jury process.— When undeniable irregularities in the grand jury process are brought to the court's attention in advance of trial, a grand jury indictment resulting from that process must be quashed.De Leon v. Hartley, 2014-NMSC-005.\n\nIndictment returned after the three-month term has expired does not deprive the court of jurisdiction.— The number of days in the term of a grand jury, being merely a matter of statute, goes not to the jurisdiction of the court, but to the manner in which the power is to be exercised.State v. Bent, 2012-NMSC-038, 289 P.3d 1225,rev'g2011-NMCA-093, 150 N.M. 561, 263 P.3d 903.\n\nChallenges to an indictment returned after the three-month term has expired.— Statutory challenges to an indictment that is returned after the three-month period has expired must be adjudicated before trial and before a jury issues a verdict on the offenses charged in the indictment.State v. Bent, 2012-NMSC-038, 289 P.3d 1225,rev'g2011-NMCA-093, 150 N.M. 561, 263 P.3d 903.\n\nWhere the grand jury returned an indictment against defendant long after the three-month period of the grand jury's term had expired; the trial court denied defendant's motions to quash the indictment and for an interlocutory appeal; defendant did not file a request with the supreme court for extraordinary relief; and a jury convicted defendant of the offenses charged in the indictment, there was no adequate remedy available for defendant.State v. Bent, 2012-NMSC-038, 289 P.3d 1225,rev'g2011-NMCA-093, 150 N.M. 561, 263 P.3d 903.\n\nThe three-month limitation on the term of a grand jury is a mandatory limitation on the grand jury's jurisdiction, because it is central to the legal constitution and empanelment of the grand jury.State v. Bent, 2011-NMCA-093, 150 N.M. 561, 263 P.3d 903, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 903,rev'd, 2012-NMSC-038, 289 P.3d 1225.\n\nAn indictment that is returned after the grand jury's three-month term has expiredis void ab initio and confers no jurisdiction to try the defendant.State v. Bent, 2011-NMCA-093, 150 N.M. 561, 263 P.3d 903, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 903,rev'd, 2012-NMSC-038, 289 P.3d 1225.\n\nAn indictment returned after the grand jury's term has expired is void.— Where a grand jury was convened in October 2007; grand jurors were summoned for service in November 2007; the district judge verbally extended the grand jury's term beyond the three-month term; and the grand jury returned an indictment against defendant when it was recalled in May 2008 to hear defendant's case, the indictment was void and the district court did not have jurisdiction to try defendant.State v. Bent, 2011-NMCA-093, 150 N.M. 561, 263 P.3d 903, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 903,rev'd, 2012-NMSC-038, 289 P.3d 1225.\n\nReport not a judgment.-- The report of a grand jury convened to consider petitions filed by plaintiff alleging crimes of which plaintiff was the victim is not a final, appealable order.McKenzie v. Fifth Judicial Dist. Ct., 1988-NMCA-085, 107 N.M. 778, 765 P.2d 194, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 785, 765 P, 3d 758\n\nDirectory nature of section.— This section and 31-6-2 NMSA 1978 are merely directory, not mandatory.State v. Apodaca, 1987-NMCA-033, 105 N.M. 650, 735 P.2d 1156, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 618, 735 P.2d 535,overruled on other grounds byState v. Garcia, 1990-NMCA-065, 110 N.M. 419, 796 P.2d 1115, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 282, 795 P.2d 87.\n\nSubstitution of grand jurors by the court clerk is properwhere he acts pursuant to a standing order of the district judge, so long as such an order does not amount to an abuse of discretion.State v. Gilbert, 1982-NMSC-095, 98 N.M. 530, 650 P.2d 814.\n\nEffect of grand jury no bill.— A grand jury no bill does not prevent the district attorney from either resubmitting a matter to the grand jury or charging a defendant by information; this result is reached because of the absence of limitation upon the district attorney's authority as prosecutor.State v. Chavez, 1979-NMCA-075, 93 N.M. 270, 599 P.2d 1067, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 172, 598 P.2d 215.\n\nLength of session governed by court.— The determination as to when grand jury had completed the business before them rested with the court.State v. Raulie, 1930-NMSC-074, 35 N.M. 135, 290 P. 789.\n\nWhen court may refuse to present matters to grand jury.— A district court to which an otherwise valid citizen petition for grand jury is presented possesses the discretion to determine whether the matters stated in the petition are reasonably within the lawful scope of grand jury inquiry. Only where the petition clearly seeks to involve a grand jury in matters beyond its purview may the court refuse to present those matters to a grand jury or to convene a grand jury where no regularly sitting grand jury is available. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-14.\n\nEffect of saving clause's absence.— The absence of a saving clause in either Laws 1969, ch. 222 or ch. 276 indicates the legislature did not intend the repealed law relative to jury selection to remain effective after July 1, 1969 and did intend that the provisions of both Laws 1969, ch. 222 and ch. 276 be complied with insofar as possible, after that date. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-98 (rendered under prior law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Grand Jury: True Tribunal of the People or Administrative Agency of the Prosecutor?\" see 2 N.M.L.

      "text": "Any person held to answer for an offense by grand jury indictment, upon arraignment to the charge therein, by motion to quash the indictment stating with particularity the ground therefor, may challenge the validity of the grand jury. A failure to file such motion is a waiver of the challenge. Grounds that may be presented by such motion are limited to the following:\n\nA. the grand jury was not selected in accordance with law;\n\nB. a member of the grand jury returning the indictment was ineligible to serve as a juror;\n\nC. a member of the grand jury returning the indictment was a witness or is likely to become a witness; or\n\nD. a member of the grand jury returning the indictment was not qualified to serve due to a conflict of interest, bias, partiality or inability to follow the law.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-5-3, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 3; 2003, ch. 363, § 1.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 14, repealed former 41-5-3, 1953 Comp., relating to challenges to individual grand jurors.\n\nCross references.— For drawing and empaneling jurors,see38-5-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, inserted \"or is likely to become a witness; or\" at the end of Subsection C and added Subsection D.\n\nThe effect of this sectionis to prohibit a grand juror from testifying before the grand jury of which he or she is a member. Defendant's contention that grand jurors were witnesses against him because the grand jury had returned two indictments against him prior to returning the present indictment, and had \"witnessed\" the actions of defendant which led to a subsequent contempt citation was without merit as it perverted the meaning of \"witness\" as used in the grand jury statutes.State v. Hogervorst, 1977-NMCA-057, 90 N.M. 580, 566 P.2d 828, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 636, 567 P.2d 485.\n\nChallenge is not to court's jurisdiction.— An attack on the eligibility of one grand juror does not raise an issue as to the jurisdiction of the court, but goes only to the procedural requirements for returning an indictment.State v. Velasquez, 1982-NMCA-154, 99 N.M. 109, 654 P.2d 562, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 148, 655 P.2d 160.\n\nJuror's bias not ground for attack where indictment sufficient.— Bias or prejudice on the part of an individual grand juror furnishes no ground of attack on an indictment that is sufficient on its face.State v. Laskay, 1986-NMCA-008, 103 N.M. 799, 715 P.2d 72, cert. denied, 103 N.M. 798, 715 P.2d 71.\n\nUnless prejudice caused indictment by malice or ill will.— A challenge would not be precluded in the event that grand jurors were so prejudiced against a person that the jurors would be ineligible to serve because an indictment by jurors so prejudiced would violate their oath to indict no person through malice, hatred or ill will.State v. Laskay, 1986-NMCA-008, 103 N.M. 799, 715 P.2d 72, cert. denied, 103 N.M. 798, 715 P.2d 71.\n\nResidence as qualification for grand jury service is question of fact.State v. Watkins, 1979-NMCA-003, 92 N.M. 470, 590 P.2d 169.\n\nTemporary absence of person from county of residence,without the intention of abandoning that residence, will not destroy the person's qualification to serve as a grand juror.State v. Watkins, 1979-NMCA-003, 92 N.M. 470, 590 P.2d 169.\n\nWhere grand jury which heard defendant's false testimony returned indictment for perjury based on that testimony,such jurors are not witnesses under this section, nor are they presumed to be biased.State v. Watkins, 1979-NMCA-003, 92 N.M. 470, 590 P.2d 169.\n\nAccused not present during empaneling.— It was never the practice to bring accused into court when empaneling the grand jury.Territory v. Young, 1881-NMSC-007, 2 N.M. 93.\n\nObjections raised before plea available.— Any objections to legal qualifications of grand jurors were to be raised and presented in proper form to court before defendant entered his plea of not guilty and were not available on motion in arrest of judgment. Territory v. Armijo, 1894-NMSC-011, 7 N.M. 571, 37 P. 1117 (decided under former law).\n\nBut not after plea.— Objections to character of grand jury, or qualification of an individual member, came too late after plea to the merits.Territory v. Romero, 1883-NMSC-006, 2 N.M. 474 (decided under former law).\n\nEffect of saving clause's absence.— The absence of a saving clause in either Laws 1969, ch. 222 or ch. 276 indicates the legislature did not intend the repealed law relative to jury selection to remain effective after July 1, 1969 and did intend that the provisions of both Laws 1969, ch. 222 and ch. 276 be complied with insofar as possible, after that date. 1969 Op.

      "text": "A. A grand jury shall conduct its hearing during the usual business hours of the court which convened it. Hearings and deliberations may be conducted at any place ordered by the convening judge and provided by the court. Inspections or grand jury views of places under inquiry may be made when directed by the foreman wherever deemed necessary within the county, but no oral testimony or other evidence may be received except during formal private sessions.\n\nB. All deliberations shall be conducted in a private room outside the hearing or presence of any person other than the grand jury members. All taking of testimony shall be in private with no persons present other than the grand jury, the persons required or entitled to assist the grand jury and the attorney, if any, of the target.\n\nC. Persons required or entitled to be present at the taking of testimony before the grand jury include the district attorney and the attorney general and their staffs, interpreters, court reporters, security officers, the witness and an attorney for the target. Security personnel may be present only with special leave of the district court and are neither potential witnesses nor otherwise interested parties in the matter being presented to the grand jury.\n\nD. If a target has his attorney present, the attorney may be present only while the target witness is testifying and may advise the witness but may not speak so that he can be heard by the grand jurors or otherwise participate in the proceedings. At least twenty-four hours before grand jury proceedings begin, the target's attorney may submit proposed questions and exhibits to the district attorney or the attorney general.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-5-4, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 4; 1979, ch. 337, § 2; 1981, ch. 262, § 2; 2003, ch. 363, § 2.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 14, repealed former 41-5-4, 1953 Comp., relating to trial of challenges to the grand jury.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, deleted \"witness\" following \"target\" in Subsection B and present Subsection D; rewrote Subsection C; and added Subsection D.\n\nPurpose of section is to maintain utmost secrecy;therefore, it has been the practice for more than 200 years for the investigations of the grand jury to be in private, except that the district attorney and his assistant are present, since secrecy is the vital requisite of grand jury procedure.State v. Hill, 1975-NMCA-093, 88 N.M. 216, 539 P.2d 236.\n\n\"Unusual business hours\".— Although the language of this section requires the grand jury to conduct its hearing during the usual business hours of the court, a distinction must be made between the business hours of the judge who convenes the grand jury and the business hours of the court. Because a particular judge is unavailable after 5:00 p.m. does not make access to the court impossible.State v. Weiss, 1986-NMCA-128, 105 N.M. 283, 731 P.2d 979, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 290, 731 P.2d 1334.\n\nUsual business hours.— Where the grand jury was convened at 8:30 a.m. and returned a true bill at 2:12 a.m. on the following morning, this unusually extended session of the grand jury was not a substantial violation of defendants' rights, though it constituted a technical violation of this section.State v. Weiss, 1986-NMCA-128, 105 N.M. 283, 731 P.2d 979, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 290, 731 P.2d 1334.\n\n\"Prejudice\" is appropriate constitutional standard.— Inasmuch as \"prejudice\" is an appropriate standard in considering the exercise of constitutional rights before a trial jury which determines guilt, there is no reason to apply a stricter standard in considering the exercise of constitutional rights before a grand jury which determines probable cause to accuse.State v. Martinez, 1982-NMCA-002, 97 N.M. 585, 642 P.2d 188, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 51, 644 P.2d 1040.\n\nNo opportunity for improper influence on grand jury allowed.— The law protects the fairness and impartiality of the grand jury hearing. Not only must there be no improper influence exercised, there must be no opportunity for improper influence on the grand jury.State v. Hill, 1975-NMCA-093, 88 N.M. 216, 539 P.2d 236.\n\nPresence of unauthorized persons in a grand jury proceedingjeopardizes the basic purpose of the proceeding and opens the door to a number of potential abuses.State v. Bigler, 1982-NMCA-136, 98 N.M. 732, 652 P.2d 754, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 762, 652 P.2d 1213.\n\nType of evidence presented not included within meaning of section.— This section does not deal with the type of evidence which may be presented to a grand jury.State v. Evans, 1976-NMCA-113, 89 N.M. 765, 557 P.2d 1114, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619.\n\nUnauthorized person's presence requires dismissal of indictment.— The presence of an unauthorized person before the grand jury requires dismissal of the indictment without the necessity of showing prejudice.Davis v. Traub, 1977-NMSC-049, 90 N.M. 498, 565 P.2d 1015.\n\nIssuance of writ of prohibition.— Writ of prohibition is properly issued when the indictment is dismissed because of the presence of an unauthorized person before the grand jury.Davis v. Traub, 1977-NMSC-049, 90 N.M. 498, 565 P.2d 1015.\n\nDistrict attorney's presence during deliberations prohibited.— The presence of the district attorney during deliberations of the grand jury is specifically and unequivocably prohibited by this section, which is clear and is not subject to construction. No one other than the grand jury members may be present during the time the grand jury is deliberating. Like other statutes governing grand jury proceedings, it is to be rigorously observed and strictly enforced.Baird v. State, 1977-NMSC-067, 90 N.M. 667, 568 P.2d 193.\n\nImpropriety of district attorney's presence may be waived.— Notwithstanding the fact that district attorney violated this section by his presence during grand jury deliberations, defendant charged with murder waived her objections based upon such improprieties by entering into a plea and disposition agreement which was approved and accepted by the trial court through a plea of no contest to the charge of involuntary manslaughter. The defects of the grand jury proceedings were not so fundamental that they could not be waived.Baird v. State, 1977-NMSC-067, 90 N.M. 667, 568 P.2d 193.\n\nActions of state or defense attorneys insufficient to invalidate indictment.— The mere fact that assistant attorneys general disagree in the grand jury's presence, or that defense attorneys would have presented different legal advice to the grand jury, does not invalidate the indictment.State v. Carr, 1981-NMCA-029, 95 N.M. 755, 626 P.2d 292, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 669, 625 P.2d 1186, and cert. denied, 454 U.S. 853, 102 S. Ct. 298, 70 L. Ed. 2d 145 (1981),overruled on other grounds byState v. Olguin, 1994-NMCA-050, 118 N.M. 91, 879 P.2d 92. Sct. Olguin affirms app Olguin.\n\nAttorney not \"present\" merely because he took deposition testimony.— Because the grand jury has the power to subpoena \"records or other evidence relevant to its inquiry,\" the grand jury could properly consider deposition testimony, and the fact that the deposition was taken by attorney did not make attorney present, within the meaning of this section, when the deposition was read to the grand jury.State v. Evans, 1976-NMCA-113, 89 N.M. 765, 557 P.2d 1114, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619.\n\nNo statutory right to counsel.— Neither the Grand Jury Act nor the Public Defender Act provides a target witness testifying before a grand jury with a right to counsel such that an indictment must be dismissed if counsel is not present and there is no express voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of counsel's presence.State v. Tisthammer, 1998-NMCA-115, 126 N.M. 52, 966 P.2d 760, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 107, 967 P.2d 447.\n\nPostponement to obtain counsel.— A target witness has no statutory right to counsel; therefore, the state was not required to postpone the grand jury proceedings to allow the witness time to obtain counsel.State v. Tisthammer, 1998-NMCA-115, 126 N.M. 52, 966 P.2d 760, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 107, 967 P.2d 447.\n\nWhen district attorney's assistant not permitted in grand jury room.— It is highly improper for counsel employed to prosecute a case to be permitted to go into the grand jury room where the defendant cannot be heard and has no one to represent him. This duty should be performed alone by the proper officer of the law and assistant to the district attorney may not be present or participate in the grand jury hearing room.State v. Hill, 1975-NMCA-093, 88 N.M. 216, 539 P.2d 236.\n\nProsecuting attorney assists grand jury, but not as partisan.— While this statute contemplates that the prosecuting attorney will assist the grand jury, nevertheless the prosecuting attorney does not appear before the grand jury as a partisan, bent upon obtaining an indictment; the presence and participation of an attorney ordered by the trial judge to assist in the prosecution of a case, who was employed by the father-in-law of the deceased, in the grand jury hearing was unlawful and in violation of this section and invalidated the indictment.State v. Hill, 1975-NMCA-093, 88 N.M. 216, 539 P.2d 236.\n\nConflict of interest precludes prosecutor's appearance.— The prosecutor himself is unauthorized to appear before the grand jury if there is a conflict of interest (1) in which his own property is damaged by criminal mischief, or (2) arising from prior employment with the defendant; since the prosecutor is a public officer with duties quasi-judicial in nature, with an obligation to protect not only the public interest but also the rights of the accused, in the performance of his duties he must not only be disinterested and impartial but must also appear to be so, scrupulously refraining from words or conduct that may influence the decision of the grand jury and observing limits of essential fairness.State v. Hill, 1975-NMCA-093, 88 N.M. 216, 539 P.2d 236.\n\nAttorney general's investigator not \"authorized person\" to assist in hearing.— Claim that an investigator for the attorney general was an \"authorized person\" and his presence in the grand jury room was not improper inasmuch as he had been appointed a grand jury aide pursuant to Section 31-6-7 NMSA 1978, had no merit because grand jury aides are not authorized by statute to be present in the grand jury room unless they fall within the categories specified in this section.Davis v. Traub, 1977-NMSC-049, 90 N.M. 498, 565 P.2d 1015.\n\n\"Staff\" construed.— Attorney general's assertion that any member of his staff could properly be present during the grand jury hearings was an erroneous interpretation of this section and ignored the meaning of the words \"persons required or entitled to assist the grand jury.\" Such persons are enumerated in the statute. Staff in this context refers to the legal staff of the district attorney or the attorney general's office, e.g. assistant district attorneys or assistant attorneys general.Davis v. Traub, 1977-NMSC-049, 90 N.M. 498, 565 P.2d 1015.\n\nPresence of person not officially listed as court reporter upheld.— Person who was present during grand jury deliberations for purpose of monitoring an electronic device that recorded the grand jury testimony was within the definition of court reporter for purposes of this section. Defendant's claim that such person was not authorized to be present because he was not listed as official court reporter was frivolous, there being no contention that the operator's presence was not for the purpose of operating the recording device.State v. Baird, 1977-NMCA-041, 90 N.M. 678, 568 P.2d 204,aff'd, 1977-NMSC-067, 90 N.M. 667, 568 P.2d 193.\n\n\"Target witness\",referred to in Subsections B and C, is anyone who is the focus of a grand jury's investigation.State v. Hall, 1985-NMCA-075, 103 N.M. 207, 704 P.2d 461.\n\nFailure to notify of target status.— Defendant was not entitled to notice that he was a target of the grand jury investigation when at the time the offense (perjury before the grand jury) had not yet been committed.State v. Albin, 1986-NMCA-046, 104 N.M. 315, 720 P.2d 1256, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 246, 719 P.2d 1267,overruled on other grounds byState v. Benavidez, 1999-NMCA-53, 127 N.M. 189, 979 P.2d 234.\n\nSimultaneous appearance of two witnesses violates statute.— Since this section refers to \"the witness\" in the singular, incident which occurred during grand jury investigation wherein two witnesses appeared before the grand jury simultaneously clearly violated the terms of the statute.Davis v. Traub, 1977-NMSC-049, 90 N.M. 498, 565 P.2d 1015.\n\nPresumption of prejudice when indictment quashed.— A showing of prejudice is not required when an unauthorized person is present at grand jury proceedings in order to have the indictment quashed. Prejudice is presumed.State v. Hill, 1975-NMCA-093, 88 N.M. 216, 539 P.2d 236.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —38 Am.

Where these requirements were met, the fact that the entire grand jury was not present at the time of the \"return\" did not invalidate the indictment.State v.

The following oaths shall be administered by the district judge to jurors, officers of the court or others assigned to assist the grand jury, and by the foreman to witnesses:\n\n(1) JUROR OATH: \"You, as members of this grand jury, do swear (or affirm) that you will diligently inquire and true indictment make, of all public offenses against the people of this state, committed or triable within this county, of which you shall receive legal evidence; that you shall indict no person through malice, hatred or ill will; nor have any not indicted through fear, favor or affection, or for any reward or the hope or promise thereof; but in all your indictments, reports or undertakings, you shall present the truth, according to the best of your skill and understanding, and further that you will forever keep secret whatever you or any other juror may have said or in what manner you or any other juror may have voted on any matter before you; and that you will keep secret the testimony of any witness heard by you unless ordered by the court to disclose the same in the trial or prosecution of the witness for perjury before the grand jury, so help you God.\";\n\n(2) OATH FOR OFFICER OR OTHER PERSON: \"You do swear (or affirm) that you will keep secret all proceedings occurring in your presence or of which you may learn as a result of your service in aid of the grand jury, so help you God.\"; and\n\n(3) OATH FOR WITNESS: \"You do swear (or affirm) that the testimony which you are about to give will be the truth, so help you God.\"\n\nB. Any person found to have violated the oath under Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection A of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. This subsection shall not apply to communications by the prosecuting attorney to his staff or grand jury aides and in obtaining and presenting evidence, preparing indictments, reports and other undertakings of the grand jury and in preparation for trial.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-5-6, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 6; 1979, ch. 337, § 4.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 14, repealed former 41-5-6, 1953 Comp., relating to the effect of the challenge to the grand jury panel.\n\nRegistration of oath not required.— All that this section requires is that an oath be taken and while it is desirable that a signed oath be registered, registration is not an absolute requirement.State v.

The district attorney or his assistants shall attend the grand jury, examine witnesses and prepare indictments, reports and other undertakings of the grand jury.\n\nB. When engaged in the investigation of an offense over which he has jurisdiction, the attorney general or his assistants may attend a grand jury, examine witnesses and prepare indictments, reports and other undertakings of the grand jury.\n\nC. When a grand jury is convened in response to a citizens' grand jury petition pursuant to Article 2, Section 14 of the constitution of New Mexico, the district attorney or his assistants, unless otherwise disqualified, shall attend and conduct the grand jury.\n\nD. A prosecuting attorney attending a grand jury and all grand jurors shall conduct themselves in a fair and impartial manner at all times during grand jury proceedings.\n\nE. A grand jury, in its discretion, may make a formal, written report as to the condition and operation of any public office or institution it has investigated. The report shall not charge any public officer or other person with willful misconduct, corruption or malfeasance unless an indictment or accusation for removal from public office is also returned by the grand jury. The right of every person to be properly charged, face his accusers and be heard in his defense in open court shall not be circumvented by the report.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-5-7, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 7; 1979, ch. 337, § 5; 2001, ch. 98, § 1; 2003, ch. 363, § 4.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 14, repealed former 41-5-7, 1953 Comp., relating to the effect of a challenge to an individual grand juror.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, inserted \"and all grand jurors\" following \"grand jury\" and substituted \"during grand jury proceedings\" for \"when assisting the grand jury\" in Subsection D.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, added the Subsection A designation; in present Subsection A, substituted \"necessary personnel\" for \"court reporters, bailiffs, interpreters, clerks or other persons as required\", deleted the former second sentence, which read \"The attorney general, when requested by the district court, shall assist the grand jury\", inserted \"or his assistants\" following \"district attorney,\" deleted the former last sentence which read \"The prosecuting attorney shall conduct himself in a fair and impartial manner at all times when assisting the grand jury\"; and added Subsections B to E.\n\nDuty of district court.— It is for the district court, and the district court alone, to decide who shall serve as grand jurors. Section 31-6-7 NMSA 1978 does not allow the district court to delegate its supervisory role over the selection of the grand jury to the district attorney's office.De Leon v. Hartley, 2014-NMSC-005.\n\nSelection of a grand jury must be under the control of the district court.— Where, after the orientation and swearing of the grand jurors, the district court transferred the process of selecting and excusing jurors to the district attorney's office without further apparent involvement by the district court; the list of grand jurors used by the district attorney's office contained notations that suggested that someone in the district attorney's office excused several grand jurors; and the district court found that there was no fraud or prejudice to defendant in the conduct of the grand jury proceeding and denied defendant's pretrial motion to quash the indictment, the district court should have quashed the indictment irrespective of whether any actual fraud or prejudice was established when the improper involvement of the district attorney in the excusal of grand jurors was brought to the attention of the district court.De Leon v. Hartley, 2014-NMSC-005.\n\n\"Prejudice\" is appropriate constitutional standard.— Inasmuch as \"prejudice\" is an appropriate standard in considering the exercise of constitutional rights before a trial jury which determines guilt, there is no reason to apply a stricter standard in considering the exercise of constitutional rights before a grand jury which determines probable cause to accuse.State v. Martinez, 1982-NMCA-002, 97 N.M. 585, 642 P.2d 188, cert. quashed, 98 N.M. 51, 644 P.2d 1040.\n\nBurden of showing prejudice.— When prosecutorial misconduct during the presentment of the case is claimed, the defendant has a burden to show demonstrable prejudice.State v. Velasquez, 1982-NMCA-154, 99 N.M. 109, 654 P.2d 562, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 148, 655 P.2d 160.\n\nPrejudice need not be shown where unauthorized person present.— A defendant need not show prejudice where an unauthorized person is present during the proceedings, or where the district attorney is present during grand jury deliberations.State v. Velasquez, 1982-NMCA-154, 99 N.M. 109, 654 P.2d 562, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 148, 655 P.2d 160.\n\nProsecutor to protect public interest and rights of accused.— In dealing with the grand jury, the prosecutor's duty is to protect both the public's interest and the rights of the accused.State v. Cruz, 1983-NMSC-045, 99 N.M. 690, 662 P.2d 1357.\n\nProsecutor conduct.— Prosecutor must scrupulously refrain from words or conduct that may influence the decision of the grand jury.State v. Augustin M., 2003-NMCA-065, 133 N.M. 636, 68 P.3d 182, cert. quashed, 2004-NMCERT-002, 135 N.M. 170, 86 P.3d 48.\n\nWhere prosecutor's conduct violative of section.— Prosecutor's conduct of grand jury, where the total case was presented to the grand jury in less than nine minutes and all questioning was by leading questions, clearly violates this section.State v. Sanchez, 1980-NMCA-137, 95 N.M. 27, 618 P.2d 371,overruled on other grounds byBuzbee v. Donnelly, 1981-NMSC-097, 96 N.M. 692, 634 P.2d 1244.\n\nProsecutor's jury instructions violated this section.— Where petitioner was charged with second degree murder for the killing of petitioner's spouse; petitioner testified that the victim had physically abused petitioner and that petitioner had reported the abuse; and after giving the grand jury final jury instructions, the prosecutor told the grand jury that petitioner \"was directly appealing to you to consider the consequences of your verdict. That is absolutely inappropriate\", and that petitioner \"was improperly seeking your sympathy\", the prosecutor failed to act in a fair and impartial manner.Herrera v. Sanchez, 2014-NMSC-018.\n\nStatements explaining law or procedure.— Prosecutor's statements explaining the law or procedure are proper so long as the statements are not in conflict with the charge given to the grand jury by the court and are not otherwise incorrect statements of the law or improper.State v. Hewitt, 1988-NMCA-053, 108 N.M. 179, 769 P.2d 92, cert. quashed, 107 N.M. 785, 765 P.2d 758.\n\nProsecutorial comments found not to violate this section.— Prosecutor's comments explaining grand jury procedures concerning a target witness and the witness' attorney and the privilege against self-incrimination were not improper.State v. Martinez, 1982-NMCA-002, 97 N.M. 585, 642 P.2d 188, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 51, 644 P.2d 1040.\n\nDuty to advise grand jury of the elements of offense.— The state's obligation to advise the grand jury of the elements of the offenses it presents to the grand jury is satisfied if the prosecutor specifically directs the grand jurors, on the record, to the portions of the grand jury manual containing the elements of common offenses where the appropriate elements of the offenses under consideration may be found, a copy of the elements of each offense considered is also made a part of the record, and the prosecutor is available to answer grand juror questions about the manual on the record.State v. Ulibarri, 1999-NMCA-142, 128 N.M. 546, 994 P.2d 1164,aff'd, 2000-NMSC-007, 128 N.M. 686, 997 P.2d 818.\n\nFailure to present evidence not directly negating guilt.— The failure of the prosecutor to present evidence that did not directly negate guilt did not breach his duty to assist the grand jury fairly and impartially.State v. Juarez, 1990-NMCA-021, 109 N.M. 764, 790 P.2d 1045, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 751, 790 P.2d 1032.\n\nSection does not provide for judicial reviewas to whether exculpatory evidence was withheld from the grand jury.State v.

In cases where an indictment is not returned, the notes or transcriptions shall be destroyed unless ordered by the district judge to be preserved for good cause shown, including but not limited to the prosecution of a witness for perjury.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-5-8, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 8; 1979, ch. 337, § 6; 1983, ch. 62, § 2.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 14, repealed former 41-5-8, 1953 Comp., relating to the court's appointment of the foreman of the grand jury.\n\nThe 1983 amendmentinserted \"good cause shown, including but not limited to\" in the last sentence.\n\nPurpose of recording requirement.— The recording requirement of this section serves a number of purposes. The defendant has an opportunity to impeach the witness at trial if there is any inconsistency between grand jury testimony and trial testimony. Prosecutorial abuses of the grand jury system are restrained, and the prosecution can support its case at trial.State v. Velasquez, 1982-NMCA-154, 99 N.M. 109, 654 P.2d 562, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 148, 655 P.2d 160.\n\nAbsent prejudice, failure to record not grounds for dismissal.— In the absence of actual prejudice, there is no statutory nor constitutional ground for a dismissal of the indictment by virtue of a failure to record the grand jury proceeding.State v. Bigler, 1982-NMCA-136, 98 N.M. 732, 652 P.2d 754, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 762, 652 P.2d 1213.\n\nAdvisement of elements of crime charged.— The practice of simply providing the grand jury with a written manual containing uniform jury instructions, and not indicating on the record that the jury has been at least referred to the appropriate sections of the manual for each crime listed on the indictments, does not comply with Section 31-6-10 NMSA 1978, Rule 5-506B NMRA, or UJI 14-8001 NMRA.State v. Ulibarri, 1999-NMCA-142, 128 N.M. 546, 994 P.2d 1164,aff'd, 2000-NMSC-007, 128 N.M. 686, 997 P.2d 818.\n\nDefendant entitled to inspect record at time of trial.— A defendant, at the trial of a criminal action, was entitled to inspect the grand jury testimony of the state's witness.State v. Morgan, 1960-NMSC-087, 67 N.M. 287, 354 P.2d 1002.\n\nExamine portion of testimony after trial.— Once the witness has testified at the criminal trial about that which he testified before the grand jury, the accused is entitled to an order permitting examination of that portion of the witness's grand jury testimony relating to the crime for which defendant is charged. The witness may be cross-examined concerning that testimony. If otherwise, an accused is denied the right to confront the witnesses against him.State v. Sparks, 1973-NMCA-108, 85 N.M. 429, 512 P.2d 1265.\n\nNot entitled to testimony in advance of trial.— Accused was not entitled to transcript of testimony of all witnesses who testified before grand jury with respect to criminal charge out of which indictments against him arose, in advance of trial, in the absence of showing of any particularized need.State v. Tackett, 1967-NMSC-207, 78 N.M. 450, 432 P.2d 415, cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1026, 88 S. Ct. 1414, 20 L. Ed. 2d 283 (1968).\n\nReview of minutes by trial court harmless error.— Reading and review of grand jury minutes by trial court, although improper, was harmless error since such review was not the basis for allegedly erroneous ruling.State v. Elam, 1974-NMCA-075, 86 N.M. 595, 526 P.2d 189, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 593, 526 P.2d 187.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —38 Am.

      "text": "The district judge convening a grand jury shall charge it with its duties and direct it as to any special inquiry into violations of law that he wishes it to make.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-5-9, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 9; 1993, ch. 71, § 1.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 14, repealed former 41-5-9, 1953 Comp., relating to the oath administered to the foreman of the grand jury.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, rewrote this section to the extent that a detailed comparison is impracticable.\n\nLimiting grand jury investigation.— The district court does not possess discretion to limit the investigative prerogative of the grand jury. Once convened for a specific inquiry, a grand jury should be obliged likewise to inquire into other offenses of which it may have knowledge.State ex rel. Deschamps v. Kase, 1992-NMSC-040, 114 N.M. 38, 834 P.2d 415.\n\nDistrict courts may limit grand jury investigations to specific incidents identified in the petition. Therefore petition to convene a grand jury must contain sufficient information to enable the court to determine whether the petitioners seek a legitimate inquiry into alleged criminal conduct or malfeasance of a public official or whether petitioners seek nothing more than a witch hunt.District Court v. McKenna, 1994-NMSC-102, 118 N.M. 402, 881 P.2d 1387, cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1018, 115 S. Ct. 1361, 131 L. Ed. 2d 218.\n\nIndictment for perjury committed before grand jury.— A grand jury may properly indict a defendant for perjury on the basis of defendant's false testimony before the grand jury since such an indictment is consistent with the juror's duty to inquire into public offenses.State v. Watkins, 1979-NMCA-003, 92 N.M. 470, 590 P.2d 169.\n\nDistinction between grand and petit juries.— There was a wide distinction between a grand and a petit jury as to their functions and methods of procedure. The action of the former was simply preliminary; it was an inquiry by the grand inquest as to whether there was such probability for the statements made before them, which were usually ex parte, of the guilt of a certain person, that he ought to be placed on trial.Territory v. Young, 1881-NMSC-007, 2 N.M. 93.\n\nDuty to share knowledge of offenses committed with fellow jurors.— It was not expected that in every instance each grand juror be free from all previous knowledge of the cases, or even of the precise circumstances of the cases coming before them for official action; on the contrary, it was stated in the statute as to their powers and duties, which was to be read to every grand jury as a part of the charge, that if a member knew of an offense committed, he was to declare the same to his fellow jurors.Territory v.

      "text": "Before the grand jury may vote an indictment charging an offense against the laws of the state, it must be satisfied from the lawful evidence before it that an offense against the laws has been committed and that there is probable cause to accuse by indictment the person named, of the commission of the offense so that he may be brought to trial therefor. In the absence of an indictment against a person holding public office or a presentment for the removal of a local elected officer, the grand jury shall not denigrate that person's moral fitness to hold public office. Eight jurors must concur to return an indictment.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-5-10, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 10; 1979, ch. 337, § 7.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 14, repealed former 41-5-10, 1953 Comp., relating to the oath administered to grand jurors.\n\nCross references.— For number of jurors necessary to concur in finding indictment,seeN.M. Const., art. II, § 14.\n\nWithdrawal of charges from the grand jury.— Where, during a grand jury proceeding, the prosecutor initially withdrew three charges of contributing to the delinquency of a minor against the defendant and later gave the grand jurors the option to consider any of those charges which resulted in the grand jury finding probable cause for all three charges, the inclusion of the three withdrawn charges in the indictment was proper.State v. Dietrich, 2009-NMCA-031, 145 N.M. 733, 204 P.3d 748, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-002, 145 N.M. 704, 204 P.3d 29,overruled in part by State v.

      "text": "A. Evidence before the grand jury upon which it may find an indictment is that which is lawful, competent and relevant, including the oral testimony of witnesses under oath and any documentary or other physical evidence exhibited to the jurors. The Rules of Evidence shall not apply to a grand jury proceeding. The sufficiency of the evidence upon which an indictment is returned shall not be subject to review absent a showing of bad faith on the part of the prosecuting attorney assisting the grand jury.\n\nB. It is the duty of the grand jury to weigh all the evidence submitted to it, and when it has reason to believe that other lawful, competent and relevant evidence is available that would disprove or reduce a charge or accusation or that would make an indictment unjustified, then it shall order the evidence produced. At least twenty-four hours before grand jury proceedings begin, the target or his counsel may alert the grand jury to the existence of evidence that would disprove or reduce an accusation or that would make an indictment unjustified, by notifying the prosecuting attorney who is assisting the grand jury in writing regarding the existence of that evidence.\n\nC. A district attorney shall use reasonable diligence to notify a person in writing that the person is the target of a grand jury investigation. Unless the district judge presiding over the grand jury determines by clear and convincing evidence that providing notification may result in flight by the target, result in obstruction of justice or pose a danger to another person, the target of a grand jury investigation shall be notified in writing of the following information:\n\n(1) that he is the target of an investigation;\n\n(2) the nature of the alleged crime being investigated and the date of the alleged crime and any applicable statutory citations;\n\n(3) the target's right to testify no earlier than four days after receiving the target notice if he is in custody, unless for good cause the presiding judge orders a different time period or the target agrees to testify sooner;\n\n(4) the target's right to testify no earlier than ten days after receiving the target notice if he is not in custody, unless for good cause the presiding judge orders a different time period or the target agrees to testify sooner;\n\n(5) the target's right to choose to remain silent; and\n\n(6) the target's right to assistance of counsel during the grand jury investigation.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-5-11, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 11; 1979, ch. 337, § 8; 1981, ch. 238, § 1; 2003, ch. 363, § 5.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 14, repealed former 41-5-11, 1953 Comp., relating to the oath given to jurors subsequently admitted.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, inserted \"that which is lawful, competent and relevant, including\" in the first sentence, added the second sentence, and deleted \"or competency\" following \"sufficiency\" in Subsection A; inserted \"lawful\" following \"other\", \"and relevant\" following \"competent\" and \"or reduce\" following \"disprove\" in the first sentence and deleted the last three sentences, which read \"The target shall be notified of his target status and be given an opportunity to testify, if he desires to do so, unless the prosecutor determines that notification may result in flight, endanger other persons, obstruct justice, or the prosecutor is unable with reasonable diligence to notify said person. A showing of reasonable diligence in notifying the target by the prosecutor is not required unless and until the target establishes actual and substantial prejudice as a result of an alleged failure by the prosecutor to exercise reasonable diligence in notifying the target of his target status before the grand jury. The prosecuting attorney assisting the grand jury shall present evidence that directly negates the guilt of the target where he is aware of such evidence\" and added the present second sentence in Subsection B; and added Subsection C.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION\n\nCourts are without power to review the sufficiency of the evidence upon which an indictment is returned absent a showing of bad faith.— Where a grand jury indicted defendants for armed robbery based on information developed as a result of subpoenas that represented on their face that they were issued in the name of the eighth judicial district court, but were actually prepared by a deputy district attorney in the eighth judicial district at a time where there was no pending prosecution, court action, or grand jury proceeding, and where defendants moved to quash the indictments or alternatively to suppress all evidence obtained through the use of the contested subpoenas, the district court erred in granting the motion and quashing the indictments based on the unlawful subpoenas, because the sufficiency of the evidence upon which an indictment is returned is not subject to review absent a showing of bad faith on the part of the prosecuting attorney assisting the grand jury.State v. Martinez, 2018-NMSC-031.\n\nFirst-degree kidnapping.— A prosecutor seeking to indict an accused for first-degree kidnapping must present to the grand jury both the primary elements found in UJI 14-403 NMRA and the special verdicts form found in UJI 14-6018 NMRA and establish probable cause for the same elements at the grand jury stage.State v. Gallegos, 2009-NMSC-017, 146 N.M. 88, 206 P.3d 993.\n\n\"Prejudice\" is appropriate constitutional standard.— Inasmuch as \"prejudice\" is an appropriate standard in considering the exercise of constitutional rights before a trial jury which determines guilt, there is no reason to apply a stricter standard in considering the exercise of constitutional rights before a grand jury which determines probable cause to accuse.State v. Martinez, 1982-NMCA-002, 97 N.M. 585, 642 P.2d 188, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 51, 644 P.2d 1040.\n\nSubsection B \"prejudice\".— The prejudice with which former Subsection B is concerned is prejudice in charging criminal conduct on the basis of probable cause.State v. Penner, 1983-NMCA-116, 100 N.M. 377, 671 P.2d 38 (decided under prior law).\n\nProsecutor to impartially assist grand jury.— Although, following the 1981 amendment of this section, a prosecutor is not limited to presenting evidence admissible at trial to the grand jury, he is still constrained by his duty to assist the grand jury in a fair and impartial manner.Buzbee v. Donnelly, 1981-NMSC-097, 96 N.M. 692, 634 P.2d 1244.\n\nStatements explaining law or procedure.— Statements by a prosecutor to the grand jury explaining the law or procedure are proper so long as the statements are not in conflict with the charge given to the grand jury by the court or are not otherwise incorrect statements of the law or improper.State v. Hewitt, 1988-NMCA-053, 108 N.M. 179, 769 P.2d 92, cert. quashed, 107 N.M. 785, 765 P.2d 758.\n\nNo requirement to instruct on defenses.— The rule requiring instruction to the grand jury on the essential elements of the crime charged does not apply to defenses.State v. Augustin M., 2003-NMCA-065, 133 N.M. 636, 68 P.3d 182, cert. quashed, 2004-NMCERT-002, 135 N.M. 170, 86 P.3d 48.\n\nIn a prosecution for possession of marijuana in which the defendant argued that his possession and use of marijuana was a religious belief and sacrament, the prosecutor had no duty to instruct the grand jury on the defendant's \"religious-use defense\".State v. Augustin M., 2003-NMCA-065, 133 N.M. 636, 68 P.3d 182, cert. quashed, 2004-NMCERT-002, 135 N.M. 170, 86 P.3d 48.\n\nCausation in vehicular homicide case.— Even though causation is an essential element of the charge of vehicular homicide, the prosecutor is not required to instruct the grand jury on causation, including the definitions of proximate cause.State v. Augustin M., 2003-NMCA-065, 133 N.M. 636, 68 P.3d 182, cert. quashed, 2004-NMCERT-002, 135 N.M. 170, 86 P.3d 48.\n\nTrial court abused its discretion in quashing an indictment,where there was no indication that prosecutor's answers to jurors' questions improperly influenced the independent judgment of the jury so as to exclude or disregard the evidence urged to be considered by defendant.State v. Hewitt, 1988-NMCA-053, 108 N.M. 179, 769 P.2d 92, cert. quashed, 107 N.M. 785, 765 P.2d 758.\n\nChallenge to a grand jury indictment should be raised prior to trial.— Where defendant was charged with first-degree murder, and where, prior to trial, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment arguing that he did not receive timely notice of the grand jury proceedings as required by 31-6-11 NMSA 1978, and where the district court found that defendant received timely notice and denied his motion, and where defendant was found guilty by a jury of willful, deliberate and premeditated murder, defendant's argument on appeal that the prosecution's failure to provide timely notice of the grand jury proceedings resulted in the violation of his right to testify before the grand jury was moot, because a challenge to a grand jury indictment should be raised before trial, because a jury's finding at trial of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt typically will moot any post-conviction challenges to the grand jury's determination of probable cause.State v. Gutierrez, 2021-NMSC-008.\n\nII. EVIDENCE\n\nAdmissible evidence.— Section 31-6-11A NMSA 1978 provides that all evidence presented to a grand jury must be such as would be \"legally admissible\" upon trial. Prosecuting attorneys must abide by the letter and spirit of the law, and this precludes their use of inadmissible evidence when obtaining indictments.Maldonado v. State, 1979-NMSC-102, 93 N.M. 670, 604 P.2d 363.\n\nCourt prohibited from evaluating sufficiency of evidence behind an indictment.— Where defendants were indicted for intentional or negligent child abuse resulting in great bodily harm with alternative theories that either or both inflicted the abuse or knew, or should have known, that such abuse was being inflicted; defendants were the parents of children who were determined to have been physically abused; defendants and their children lived with one of the defendants' parents; defendants each filed pretrial motions to dismiss the indictment alleging that the facts of the case were undisputed and that as a purely legal issue, there was a lack of substantial evidence that could prove the identity of the perpetrator who caused the injuries to the children; the district court held a hearing on the motions and after reviewing transcripts of witness interviews, granted the motions to dismiss; and there was no claim that the state acted improperly in any way, the district court violated Section 31-6-11 NMSA 1978.State v. LaPietra, 2010-NMCA-009, 147 N.M. 569, 226 P.3d 668, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-012, 147 N.M. 600, 227 P.3d 90.\n\nHearsay evidence.— In the absence of prosecutorial bad faith, there is not clear statutory authority for judicial review of the grand jury's determination of probable cause.State v. Gallegos, 2009-NMSC-017, 146 N.M. 88, 206 P.3d 993.\n\nProcedure to resolve pre-indictment evidentiary disputes.— A letter from a target to the grand jury generally should focus on providing the grand jury with a factual and non-argumentative description of the nature of any tangible evidence and the substance of the potential testimony of any suggested witnesses, along with the names and contact information of the necessary witnesses who could provide the exculpatory information. The letter to the grand jury should be accompanied by a separate cover letter or memorandum to the prosecutor, which will not go to the grand jury, expressing any necessary contextual information, arguments as to the propriety or significance of the requested evidence, the proposed questions, and any other matters that may be helpful to communicate to the prosecutor or the grand jury judge. If the prosecutor does not want to alert the grand jury to the existence of the witnesses suggested by the target or does not want to elicit the information from the witnesses that the target deems worthy of submission to the grand jury, the prosecutor must file a motion with the grand jury judge, with notice to the target, seeking confirmation of the prosecutor's decision not to call the witnesses or not to inquire into the subject matter proposed by the target. In the motion, the prosecutor should provide the grand jury judge with the target's letter submitting the proposed evidence, and the prosecutor's motion should state why the prosecutor believes the grand jury should not be alerted to the existence of the target-offered evidence. The grand jury judge can then decide whether to ask for a written response from the target and whether to hold a hearing to allow the parties to argue the matter. The grand jury judge should resolve the matter quickly, by written order in the judge's discretion if needed to preserve the record, giving the parties clear direction on how to proceed before the grand jury.Jones v. Murdoch, 2009-NMSC-002, 145 N.M. 473, 200 P.3d 523.\n\nNo post-indictment review.— There is no statutory right to post-indictment review for compliance with the pre-indictment procedures for enforcing Subsection B of Section 31-6-11 NMSA 1978 absent a showing of prosecutorial bad faith.State v. Yaw, 2011-NMCA-023, 150 N.M. 279, 258 P.3d 1071, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere defendant, who was arrested for child abuse, sent a letter to the prosecutor serving as grand jury aide requesting the prosecutor to allow the grand jury to hear testimony from the children; the prosecutor did not comply with the request; defendant moved the grand jury judge to order the prosecutor to present the evidence to the grand jury; the grand jury judge held a hearing and ruled that the prosecutor did not have to present the evidence to the grand jury; and defendant did not claim that there was prosecutorial misconduct, defendant did not have a right to post-indictment review of the evidence presented to the grand jury.State v. Yaw, 2011-NMCA-023, 150 N.M. 279, 258 P.3d 1071, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-001.\n\nFailure to disclose polygraph score.— Where the prosecution specifically told grand jury that defendant passed polygraph test, but failed to tell the grand jury his actual score on the test, the trial court properly refused defendant's motion to dismiss. The defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced, that the evidence directly negated his guilt, or that the allegedly exculpatory evidence would have been admissible at trial.State v. Blue, 1998-NMCA-135, 125 N.M. 826, 965 P.2d 945, cert. quashed, 127 N.M. 392, 981 P.2d 1210.\n\nEvidence directly negating guilt does not require special instructionto the grand jury to weigh and consider the impact of the potentially exculpatory evidence in making a probable cause determination.State v. Augustin M., 2003-NMCA-065, 133 N.M. 636, 68 P.3d 182, cert. quashed, 2004-NMCERT-002, 135 N.M. 170, 86 P.3d 48.\n\nGrand jury findings conclusive.— The findings of a grand jury, when made by and through an indictment, duly returned into court, and regular upon its face, are conclusive, and the courts are without power or jurisdiction to inquire into the subject and review the testimony submitted to the grand jury to determine whether or not the required kind or degree of evidence was submitted.State v. Stevens, 1979-NMCA-058, 93 N.M. 434, 601 P.2d 67, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 683, 604 P.2d 821.\n\nStatutes governing evidence directory.— The statutes governing the kind, character and degree of evidence which should be produced before a grand jury in order to warrant the returning of an indictment are directory and are for the guidance of the grand jury.State v. McGill, 1976-NMCA-100, 89 N.M. 631, 556 P.2d 39.\n\nSufficiency of evidence not subject to judicial review.— The statutes concerning the evidence adduced before grand juries do not provide for judicial review of the sufficiency of the evidence considered by the grand jury.State v. Paul, 1971-NMCA-040, 82 N.M. 619, 485 P.2d 375, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 601, 485 P.2d 357.\n\nCourts powerless to review action of grand jury on indictments.— Unless there is some clear statutory authority to do so, the courts are without power to review the action of the grand jury to determine whether or not it had sufficient or insufficient, legal or illegal, competent or incompetent evidence upon which to return an indictment.State v. McGill, 1976-NMCA-100, 89 N.M. 631, 556 P.2d 39;Maldonado v. State, 1979-NMSC-102, 93 N.M. 670, 604 P.2d 363.\n\nCourts powerless to review action of grand jury on indictments; exception.— On a pretrial motion to dismiss charges alleging the sexual exploitation of children, the district court may dismiss the charges where, on the undisputed face of the materials before the court, a jury could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the material meets the elements of the offense as defined by the Sexual Exploitation of Children Act, Section 30-6A-1 NMSA 1978, et seq.State v. Rendleman, 2003-NMCA-150, 134 N.M. 744, 82 P.3d 554, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-003, 135 N.M. 51, 84 P.3d 668,overruled on other grounds byState v. Myers, 2009-NMSC-016, 146 N.M. 128, 207 P.3d 1105.\n\nSufficiency of evidence supporting indictment.— Sufficiency of evidence to support grand jury indictment is not subject to judicial review.State v. Chance, 1923-NMSC-042, 29 N.M. 34, 221 P. 183;State v. Paul, 1971-NMCA-040, 82 N.M. 619, 485 P.2d 375, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 601, 485 P.2d 357;State v. Harge, 1979-NMCA-120, 94 N.M. 11, 606 P.2d 1105,overruled on other grounds byBuzbee v. Donnelly, 1981-NMSC-097, 96 N.M. 692, 634 P.2d 1244.\n\nAn indictment duly returned into court and regular on its face cannot be challenged with respect to the kind and degree of evidence,Buzbee v. Donnelly, 1981-NMSC-097, 96 N.M. 692, 634 P.2d 1244.\n\nReview of whether exculpatory evidence withheld.— Subsection B and Section 31-6-7 NMSA 1978 do not provide for judicial review as to whether exculpatory evidence was withheld from the grand jury.State v. McGill, 1976-NMCA-100, 89 N.M. 631, 556 P.2d 39.\n\nWithholding of exculpatory evidence may cause denial of due process.— A defendant could be denied due process by a prosecutor withholding exculpatory evidence from the jury, since the grand jury has a duty to protect a citizen against unfounded accusation, and only specified persons are authorized by statute to present matters to the grand jury.State v. McGill, 1976-NMCA-100, 89 N.M. 631, 556 P.2d 39.\n\nThe withholding of exculpatory evidence from a grand jury by a prosecutor violates an accused's due process rights only when the withholding affects the outcome of the proceeding and prejudices the accused.Buzbee v. Donnelly, 1981-NMSC-097, 96 N.M. 692, 634 P.2d 1244.\n\nExculpatory circumstantial evidence.— There is no requirement that potentially exculpatory circumstantial evidence be considered by the grand jury in making a probable cause determination.State v. Augustin M., 2003-NMCA-065, 133 N.M. 636, 68 P.3d 182, cert. quashed, 2004-NMCERT-002, 135 N.M. 170, 86 P.3d 48.\n\nProsecutor's broad discretion to present exculpatory evidence.— Although a prosecutor is required to present direct exculpatory evidence to the grand jury, he is invested with wide discretion as to the selection and presentation of evidence. Mandamus will not lie where the effect of its issuance would be to improperly limit the scope of the state's prosecutorial discretion.Kerpan v. Sandoval Cnty. Dist. Att'ys Office, 1988-NMCA-007, 106 N.M. 764, 750 P.2d 464.\n\nProsecutor cannot prevent grand jury from investigating the facts.— Where petitioner was charged with second degree murder for the killing of petitioner's spouse; petitioner sent the prosecutor a letter requesting that the prosecutor alert the grand jury to evidence that petitioner had told a friend that the victim had physically abused petitioner; the letter also stated that the evidence would support a finding of self-defense; the grand jury judge ruled that the prosecutor did not have to alert the grand jury to petitioner's evidence because the letter contained legal arguments; during petitioner's testimony before the grand jury, one grand juror asked petitioner whether petitioner had ever told anyone that the victim had physically abused petitioner; and the prosecutor prevented petitioner from answering the question, the grand jury judge's ruling concerning the letter did not limit petitioner's testimony before the grand jury, the prosecutor lacked authority to preclude petitioner from answering direct questions from the grand jury, and the prosecutor interfered with the grand jury's independent duty to investigate the facts bearing on the issue of probable cause.Herrera v. Sanchez, 2014-NMSC-018.\n\nLeading questions by prosecutor did not amount to bad faith.— Where the prosecutor submitted to the grand jury a proposed indictment charging defendant with numerous counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor, and where, during the grand jury proceedings, the prosecutor asked leading questions that merely summarized what was already testified to by the witness, the prosecutor's conduct did not amount to bad faith or structural error that would require dismissal of the indictment, because the prosecuting attorney merely restated certain aspects of the witness's testimony and suggested that this testimony established elements of the offenses charged in the indictment.State v. Deignan, 2016-NMCA-065.\n\nErroneous instructions to the grand jury constitute structural error.— Where the prosecutor submitted to the grand jury a proposed indictment charging defendant with numerous counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor (CSCM), attempted CSCM, and bribery of a witness, the prosecutor's erroneous instructions to the jury, including incorrectly telling the grand jury that the third-degree CSCM count had the same elements as the second-degree CSCM charge, failing to tell the grand jury what the underlying felony defendant was being charged with attempting to commit, and failing to instruct the grand jury as to the felony that the witness knew about when defendant intimidated her, constituted structural error and required dismissal of the charges.State v. Deignan, 2016-NMCA-065.\n\nDuty of prosecutor.— This section is not violated simply because the prosecutor fails to produce evidence that is exculpatory, or through negligence fails to pursue an investigative lead that would produce directly exculpatory evidence. The prosecutor must know of the existence of the evidence and that it is exculpatory before the duty to produce it arises.State v. Armijo, 1994-NMCA-136, 118 N.M. 802, 887 P.2d 1269, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 20, 888 P.2d 466.\n\nDue process afforded where inadmissible evidence not admitted at trial.— Where inadmissible evidence which has been presented to the grand jury is not admitted at trial, the indictment is not void and the defendant is afforded due process.Maldonado v. State, 1979-NMSC-102, 93 N.M. 670, 604 P.2d 363.\n\nUse of direct evidence negating accused's guilt.— By the words \"that directly negates the guilt,\" in the last sentence in Subsection B, the legislature intended to permit the use of direct evidence negating guilt of the accused and to prohibit the use of indirect, or circumstantial, evidence negating guilt.Buzbee v. Donnelly, 1981-NMSC-097, 96 N.M. 692, 634 P.2d 1244 (decided under prior law).\n\nSubsection B requires a prosecutor to present to a grand jury only directly exculpatory evidence; he is not required to present evidence that does not directly negate guilt.State v. Juarez, 1990-NMCA-021, 109 N.M. 764, 790 P.2d 1045 (decided under prior law).\n\nExclusion of testimony not negating defendant's guilt.— Where testimony does not tend to negate defendant's guilt, its exclusion from the grand jury proceedings is no ground for dismissing the indictment.State v. Gonzales, 1981-NMCA-023, 95 N.M. 636, 624 P.2d 1033,overruled on other grounds byBuzbee v. Donnelly, 1981-NMSC-097, 96 N.M. 692, 634 P.2d 1244;State v. Lara, 1990-NMCA-075, 110 N.M. 507, 797 P.2d 296 (decided under prior law).\n\nIII. TARGET OF INVESTIGATION\n\nConstitution does not give defendant right to cross-examine witnessesappearing before the grand jury.State v. Salazar, 1970-NMCA-056, 81 N.M. 512, 469 P.2d 157.\n\nApplication of target notification requirement.— The target notification requirement under Subsection B (now Subsection C) applies to persons whom a grand jury investigates on its own initiative.State v. Gonzales, 1981-NMCA-079, 96 N.M. 513, 632 P.2d 748, cert. denied, 96 N.M. 543, 632 P.2d 1181.\n\nWhether statutory notice requirement has been met is question of fact.Rogers v. State, 1980-NMCA-034, 94 N.M. 218, 608 P.2d 530.\n\nFour-days' notice to defendant of target status deemed sufficient.— Four-days' notice of a grand jury investigation and of target status is certainly sufficient time for the defendant to exercise his right to testify.State v. Cruz, 1983-NMSC-045, 99 N.M. 690, 662 P.2d 1357.\n\nAny effective form of notice deemed sufficient.— This section does not specify the method of giving notice; any method, written or oral, suffices so long as the method employed complies with the statutory intent that the target be given an opportunity to testify.Rogers v. State, 1980-NMCA-034, 94 N.M. 218, 608 P.2d 530.\n\nNotice to target's attorney may amount to compliancewith the notice requirement, depending on the facts of the case.Rogers v. State, 1980-NMCA-034, 94 N.M. 218, 608 P.2d 530.\n\nFailure to notify of target status.— Defendant was not entitled to notice that he was a target of the grand jury investigation when at the time the offense (perjury before the grand jury) had not yet been committed.State v. Albin, 1986-NMCA-046, 104 N.M. 315, 720 P.2d 1256, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 246, 719 P.2d 1267,overruled on other grounds byState v. Benavidez, 1999-NMCA-53, 127 N.M. 189, 979 P.2d 234.\n\nDefect in required notice must be raised before trial.— The issue of whether notice has been given to the target of a grand jury investigation as required by this section is a claimed defect in the initiation of the prosecution; it must be raised prior to trial and, when raised, is to be decided by the trial court inasmuch as it does not involve a trial on the merits.Rogers v. State, 1980-NMCA-034, 94 N.M. 218, 608 P.2d 530.\n\nUntimely motion to dismiss.— Because defendant did not file his motion to dismiss for failure to provide target notice until eight months after his arraignment, and he did not show any cause below or on appeal to waive the time limit, the trial court correctly found the motion to be untimely.State v. Vallejos, 1998-NMCA-151, 126 N.M. 161, 967 P.2d 836, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 107, 967 P.2d 447.\n\nWhen notice requirement is issue, prosecutor has burdenof establishing either that the target was notified or that notification was excused under the \"unless\" clause, because the prosecutor is the party affirming that the grand jury indictment is proper.Rogers v. State, 1980-NMCA-034, 94 N.M. 218, 608 P.2d 530.\n\nDefendant assumed to have actual notice.— When the prosecutor advised the trial court in the presence of the defendant and his counsel that the parties had stipulated that letters advising the defendant of grand jury proceedings against him had not been returned as undelivered, it may be assumed that the defendant had received actual notice.State v. Garcia, 1982-NMCA-086, 98 N.M. 186, 646 P.2d 1250, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794.\n\nGrand jury target has a statutory right to testify before a grand jury.— Where defendants were indicted on multiple counts of fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, forgery, racketeering, and conspiracy to commit racketeering, and where, prior to the grand jury proceeding, defendants informed the prosecutor assisting the grand jury of their desire to testify and appeared for the grand jury investigation prepared to testify, and where the prosecutor informed the grand jury of defendants' presence and desire to testify, but failed to tell the grand jury that defendants had a right to testify, resulting in the grand jury informing the prosecutor that it did not wish to hear defendants' testimony and that it was ready to begin its deliberations, the district court did not err in quashing the indictment, because the prosecutor's failure to provide correct and complete advice to the grand jury resulted in defendants being deprived of their right to testify.State v. Pareo, 2018-NMCA-040.\n\nFailure to allow grand jury target to testify is a structural error in the grand jury process.— Where defendants were indicted on multiple counts of fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, forgery, racketeering, and conspiracy to commit racketeering, but were not permitted to exercise their right to testify, the district court did not err in quashing the indictment without requiring defendants to demonstrate prosecutorial bad faith or prejudice, because the failure to allow defendants to testify before the grand jury was a structural defect in the grand jury process that required no showing of prejudice or of prosecutorial bad faith.State v. Pareo, 2018-NMCA-040.\n\nHearing on contention of juror bias.— Petitioner deserved a full review on interlocutory appeal from an order denying his motion to dismiss the indictments against him, where his contentions that several grand jurors were biased against him and other targeted witnesses before presentation of any evidence, and that he was led to believe that he could not present his own statement or explanation of the allegations against him, raised, at the very least, the issue of demonstrable prejudice to him.Anaya v. State, 1986-NMSC-027, 104 N.M. 150, 717 P.2d 1119.\n\nBurden of showing prejudice.— Because the prejudice involved in former Subsection B is prejudice to the defendant in the bringing of a criminal charge, defendant's burden is to establish that his missing testimony would have changed the vote of the grand jury on the issue of probable cause.State v. Penner, 1983-NMCA-116, 100 N.M. 377, 671 P.2d 38.\n\nTrial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment for failure of the state to present certain statements where he did not establish demonstrable prejudice by showing a substantial probability of a different outcome.State v. Lucero, 1998-NMSC-044, 126 N.M. 552, 972 P.2d 1143.\n\nPrejudice to a defendant will not be presented from a lack of target notice and a lack of a chance to testify during a grand jury hearing. The defendant still must demonstrate the vote of the grand jury on the issue of probable cause.State v. Haynes, 2000-NMCA-060, 129 N.M. 304, 6 P.3d 1026.\n\nThe trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment based on his inability to testify before the grand jury because he was incarcerated at the time. The defendant did not demonstrate that his missing testimony would have changed the vote of the grand jury on the issue of probable cause.State v. Dominguez, 1993-NMCA-042, 115 N.M. 445, 853 P.2d 147, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 409, 852 P.2d 682.\n\nConstitutional claim not supported.— Allegation of due process claim that, while detained, appellant was denied his right to testify at a grand jury hearing, as required by Subsection C of this section, does not and cannot support a constitutional claim.Hoffman v. Martinez, 92 Fed.Appx. 628 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Survey of New Mexico Law, 1979-80: Criminal Law and Procedure,\" see 11 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. The grand jury has power to order the attendance of witnesses before it, to cause the production of all public and private records or other evidence relevant to its inquiry and to enforce such power by subpoena issued on its own authority through the district court convening the grand jury and executed by any public officer charged with the execution of legal process of the district court; provided that all subpoenaed witnesses shall be given a minimum of thirty-six hours' notice unless a shorter period is specifically approved for each witness by a judge of the district court.\n\nB. The target of the investigation shall not be subpoenaed except where it is found by the prosecuting attorney to be essential to the investigation. If the target and his attorney, if he has one, sign a document stating that the target will assert the fifth amendment, he shall be excused from testifying on those matters as to which the district judge determines he has a valid fifth-amendment privilege.\n\nC. Subpoenas directed to witnesses shall be returnable only when the grand jury is sitting.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-5-12, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 12; 1975, ch. 15, § 1; 1979, ch. 337, § 9.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1969, ch. 276, § 14, repealed former 41-5-12, 1953 Comp., relating to the charge and instructions given to the grand jury by the court.\n\nGrand jury can issue subpoena, despite court's lack of jurisdiction.— Where no statute confers jurisdiction upon the district court to order the production of handwriting exemplars, a grand jury could issue a subpoena for the exemplars and the district court could enforce the subpoena.Sanchez v. Attorney Gen., 1979-NMCA-081, 93 N.M. 210, 598 P.2d 1170.\n\nGrand jury investigation satisfies the \"pending judicial action\" requirement.— Where defendant was charged with traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a person under eighteen years of age, among other offenses, and where defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence, arguing that a grand jury subpoena duces tecum, issued to defendant's cell phone carrier requesting all known information relating to defendant's cell phone number, was unlawful under New Mexico law, it was held that although judicial subpoenas issued unilaterally by the deputy district attorney in the absence of a pending judicial action are unlawful, the subpoena in this case was issued by the grand jury after the presentment of evidence. A pending court case or grand jury investigation satisfies the \"pending judicial action\" requirement, and pre-indictment subpoenas are routinely issued in connection with grand jury proceedings under this section.United States v. Streett, 363 F. Supp.3d 1212 (D. N.M. 2018).\n\nSubdivision [Subparagraph] A applies to target.— The provision of Subdivision [Subparagraph] A of this section, \"that all subpoenaed witnesses shall be given a minimum of 36 hours' notice unless a shorter period is specifically approved for each witness by a judge of the district court,\" applies to a target, whether or not the target has been subpoenaed.Rogers v.

      "text": "A. If a witness is granted immunity in return for evidence, none of his testimony or any evidence obtained as a fruit of his testimony shall be used against him in any criminal prosecution except that such person may be prosecuted for any perjury committed in such testimony or in producing such evidence, or for contempt for failing to give an answer or produce evidence.\n\nB. Witnesses shall not be harrassed [harassed] nor subjected to unreasonable repeated appearances by the grand jury or the prosecuting attorney assisting the grand jury.\n\nHistory:Laws 1979, ch. 337, § 10; 1978 Comp., § 31-3A-1, recompiled as 1978 Comp., § 31-6-15.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material in the catchline and in Subsection B was inserted by the compiler and it is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For witness immunity,seeRule 5-116.\n\nApplicability.— Section 31-6-15 NMSA 1978 applies only to grand jury proceedings and not to court proceedings.State v. Brown, 1998-NMSC-037, 126 N.M. 338, 969 P.2d 313.\n\nSection applies only to immunity for testimony before grand juriesand not to immunity for testimony at trial.State v. Summerall, 1986-NMSC-080, 105 N.M. 82, 728 P.2d 833,rev'g1986-NMCA-032, 105 N.M. 84, 728 P.2d 835.\n\nThe very purpose of granting immunity is to reach the truth.State v. Boeglin, 1983-NMSC-088, 100 N.M. 470, 672 P.2d 643.\n\nWitness must testify truthfully.— Implicit in Subsection A is the fact that a witness must testify truthfully or be subject to being prosecuted: (1) for perjury committed in such testimony or in producing such evidence; or (2) for contempt for failure to give an answer or produce evidence. To hold otherwise would make this statute meaningless.State v. Boeglin, 1983-NMSC-088, 100 N.M. 470, 672 P.2d 643.\n\nProsecutor applies for, court grants, use immunity.— Taken together, Rule 5-116, Rule 11-412, and this section give the trial court the authority to grant use immunity when it is applied for by the prosecutor.State v. Summerall, 1986-NMCA-032, 105 N.M. 84, 728 P.2d 835,rev'd, 1986-NMSC-080, 105 N.M. 82, 728 P.2d 833.\n\nLimitations to derivative use immunity.— This statute and its implementing rules, Rule 5-116 and Rule 11-412 NMRA, allow the government to compel a witness to testify and then prosecute the witness for the crimes mentioned in the compelled testimony, as long as neither the testimony itself nor any information directly or indirectly derived from the testimony is used in the prosecution. However, it is not enough for the prosecutor to simply assert that all evidence to be used at trial was obtained prior to the defendant's immunized testimony; instead, the state should have included testimony from key witnesses, along with testimony from the prosecutor and the investigators, that the witnesses had not had access or otherwise been exposed to the defendant's immunized testimony.State v. Vallejos, 1994-NMSC-107, 118 N.M. 572, 883 P.2d 1269.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Criminal Procedure - The Fifth Amendment Privilege Against Self-Incrimination Applies to Juveniles in Court-Ordered Psychological Evaluations: State v.
