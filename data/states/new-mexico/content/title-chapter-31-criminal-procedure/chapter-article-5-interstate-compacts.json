      "text": "The Western Interstate Corrections Compact is enacted into law and entered into on behalf of New Mexico with any and all other states legally joining therein in a form substantially as follows:\n\nWESTERN INTERSTATE CORRECTIONS COMPACT\n\nArticle I - Purpose and Policy\n\nThe party states, desiring by common action to improve their institutional facilities and provide programs of sufficiently high quality for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of various types of offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to provide such facilities and programs on a basis of cooperation with one another, thereby serving the best interests of such offenders and of society. The purpose of this compact is to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders.\n\nArticle II - Definitions\n\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:\n\nA. \"state\" means a state of the United States, the territory of Hawaii, or, subject to the limitation contained in Article VII, Guam.\n\nB. \"sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which conviction was had.\n\nC. \"receiving state\" means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction was had.\n\nD. \"inmate\" means a male or female offender who is under sentence to or confined in a prison or other correctional institution.\n\nE. \"institution\" means any prison, reformatory or other correctional facility, including but not limited to a facility for the mentally ill or mentally defective, in which inmates may lawfully be confined.\n\nArticle III - Contracts\n\nA. Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states. Any such contract shall provide for:\n\n(1) its duration.\n\n(2) payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance; extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipts by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance.\n\n(3) participation in programs of inmate employment, if any; the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account thereof; and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting therefrom.\n\n(4) delivery and retaking of inmates.\n\n(5) such other matters as may be necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states.\n\nB. Prior to the construction or completion of construction of any institution or addition thereto by a party state, any other party state or states may contract therewith for the enlargement of the planned capacity of the institution or addition thereto, or for the inclusion therein of particular equipment or structures, and for the reservation of a specific percentum of the capacity of the institution to be kept available for use by inmates of the sending state or states so contracting.

Such payment may be in a lump sum or in installments as provided in the contract.\n\nC. The terms and provisions of this compact shall be a part of any contract entered into by the authority of [this compact] or pursuant thereto, and nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith.\n\nArticle IV - Procedures and Rights\n\nA. Whenever the duly constituted judicial or administrative authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary in order to provide adequate quarters and care or desirable in order to provide an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.\n\nB. The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution.\n\nC. Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III.\n\nD. Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have the benefit of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state.\n\nE. All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be cared for and treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state.\n\nF. Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearings [hearing] or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state. Costs of records made pursuant to this subdivision shall be borne by the sending state.\n\nG. Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.\n\nH. Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state.\n\nI.

Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.\n\nB. An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.\n\nArticle VI - Federal Aid\n\nAny state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.\n\nArticle VII - Entry into Force\n\nThis compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two contiguous states from among the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. For the purposes of this article, Alaska and Hawaii shall be deemed contiguous to each other; to any and all of the states of California, Oregon and Washington; and to Guam. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states, or any other state contiguous to at least one party state upon similar action by such state. Guam may become party to this compact by taking action similar to that provided for joinder by any other eligible party state and upon the consent of congress to such joinder. For the purposes of this article, Guam shall be deemed contiguous to Alaska, Hawaii, California, Oregon and Washington.\n\nArticle VIII - Withdrawal and Termination\n\nThis compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until two years after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.\n\nArticle IX - Other Arrangements Unaffected\n\nNothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.\n\nArticle X - Construction and Severability\n\nThe provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-20-11, enacted by Laws 1959, ch. 112, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For filing interstate compacts with supreme court librarian,see14-3-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nInterstate compacts are specifically treated in Section 14-3-20 NMSA 1978 (interstate compacts).State v.

Tarver, 2005-NMCA-030, 137 N.M. 115, 108 P.3d 1.\n\nState Rules Act, Section 14-4-1 NMSA 1978, et seq.,is inapplicable to interstate agreements.State v. Ellis, 1980-NMCA-187, 95 N.M. 427, 622 P.2d 1047 (Ct. App.), cert. denied, 95 N.M. 426, 622 P.2d 1046.\n\nState does not have valid transfer agreement within Arizona.— Due to the fact that an exhaustive search of the supreme court library found only one contract for a term from April 24, 1973, to June 30, 1974, and a renewal for July 1, 1975, to June 30, 1976, New Mexico does not have a valid agreement with Arizona concerning transfers of prisoners.State v. Ellis, 1980-NMCA-187, 95 N.M. 427, 622 P.2d 1047, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 426, 622 P.2d 1046.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —60 Am.

The party states, desiring by common action to improve their programs for the care and treatment of mentally disordered offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to:\n\n(1) strengthen their own programs and laws for the care and treatment of the mentally disordered offender;\n\n(2) encourage and provide for such care and treatment in the most appropriate locations, giving due recognition to the need to achieve adequacy of diagnosis, care, treatment, aftercare and auxiliary services and facilities and, to every extent practicable, to do so in geographic locations convenient for providing a therapeutic environment;\n\n(3) authorize cooperation among the party states in providing services and facilities, when it is found that cooperative programs can be more effective and efficient than programs separately pursued;\n\n(4) place such mentally disordered offender in a legal status which will facilitate his care, treatment and rehabilitation;\n\n(5) authorize research and training of personnel on a cooperative basis in order to improve the quality or quantity of personnel available for the proper staffing of programs, services and facilities for mentally disordered offenders; and\n\n(6) care for and treat mentally disordered offenders under conditions which will improve the public safety.\n\nB. Within the policies set forth in this article, it is the purpose of this compact to:\n\n(1) authorize negotiation, entry into and operations under contractual arrangements among any two or more of the party states for the establishment and maintenance of cooperative programs in any one or more of the fields for which specific provision is made in the several articles of this compact;\n\n(2) set the limits within which such contracts may operate, so as to assure protection of the civil rights of mentally disordered offenders and protection of the rights and obligations of the public and of the party states; and\n\n(3) facilitate the proper disposition of criminal charges pending against mentally disordered offenders, so that programs for their care, treatment and rehabilitation may be carried on efficiently.\n\nArticle 2 - Definitions\n\nAs used in this compact:\n\nA. \"mentally disordered offender\" means a person who has been determined, by adjudication or other method legally sufficient for the purpose in the party state where the determination is made, to be mentally ill and:\n\n(1) is under sentence for the commission of crime; or\n\n(2) who is confined or committed on account of the commission of an offense for which, in the absence of mental illness, the person would be subject to incarceration in a penal or correctional facility;\n\nB. \"patient\" means a mentally disordered offender who is cared for, treated or transferred pursuant to this compact;\n\nC. \"sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which the mentally disordered offender was convicted; or the state in which he would be subject to trial on or conviction of an offense except for his mental condition; or, within the meaning of Article 5 of this compact, the state whose authorities have filed a petition in connection with an untried indictment, information or complaint; and\n\nD. \"receiving state\" means a state party to this compact to which a mentally disordered offender is sent for care, aftercare, treatment or rehabilitation, or within the meaning of Article 5 of this compact, the state in which a petition in connection with an untried indictment, information or complaint has been filed.\n\nArticle 3 - Contracts\n\nA. Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the care and treatment of mentally disordered offenders on behalf of a sending state in facilities situated in receiving states, or for the participation of mentally disordered offenders in programs of aftercare on conditional release administered by the receiving state. Any such contract shall provide for:\n\n(1) its duration;\n\n(2) payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for patient care, treatment and extraordinary services, if any;\n\n(3) determination of responsibility for ordering or permitting the furnishing of extraordinary services, if any;\n\n(4) participation in compensated activities, if any, available to patients, the disposition or crediting of any payment received by patients on account thereof and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting therefrom;\n\n(5) delivery and retaking of mentally disordered offenders; and\n\n(6) other matters as necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states.\n\nB. Prior to the construction or completion of construction of any facility for mentally disordered offenders or addition to such facility by a party state, any other party state or states may contract therewith for the enlargement of the planned capacity of the facility or addition thereto, or for the inclusion therein of particular equipment or structures, and for the reservation of a specific percentage of the capacity of the facility to be kept available for use by patients of the sending state or states so contracting. Any sending state so contracting may, to the extent that money is legally available therefor, pay to the receiving state a reasonable sum as consideration for such enlargement of capacity or provision of equipment or structures and reservation of capacity. The payment may be in a lump sum or in installments as provided in the contract.\n\nC. A party state may contract with any one or more other party states for the training of professional or other personnel whose services, by reason of such training, would become available for or be improved in respect of ability to participate in the care and treatment of mentally disordered offenders. Such contracts may provide for such training to take place at any facility being operated or to be operated for the care and treatment of mentally disordered offenders, at any institution or facility having resources suitable for the offering of such training or may provide for the separate establishment of training facilities, provided that no separate establishment shall be undertaken unless it is determined that an appropriate existing facility or institution cannot be found at which to conduct the contemplated program. Any contract entered into pursuant to this subarticle shall provide for:\n\n(1) the administration, financing and precise nature of the program;\n\n(2) the status and employment or other rights of the trainees; and\n\n(3) all other necessary matters.\n\nD.

The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access at all reasonable times to any facility in which it has a contractual right to secure care or treatment of patients for the purpose of inspection and visiting such of its patients as may be in the facility or served by it.\n\nC. Except as otherwise provided in Article 6, patients in a facility pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed for transfer to a facility within the sending state, for transfer to another facility in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to secure care and treatment of patients, for release on aftercare or other conditional status, for discharge or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state, provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article 3.\n\nD. Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the patients of that sending state in facilities pursuant to this compact, including a psychiatric and behavioral record of each patient, and certify the record to the official designated by the sending state in order that each patient may have the benefit of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of the patient in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the record may be a source of information for the sending state.\n\nE. All patients who may be in a facility or receiving aftercare from a facility pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be cared for, treated and supervised in accordance with the standards pertaining to the program administered at the facility. The fact of presence in a receiving state shall not deprive any patient of any legal rights which the patient would have had if in custody or receiving care, treatment or supervision as appropriate in the sending state.\n\nF. Any hearing or hearings to which a patient present in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state shall be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. The record, together with any recommendations of the hearing officials, shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In all proceedings pursuant to the provisions of this subarticle, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state, and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state. Costs of records made pursuant to this subarticle shall be borne by the sending state.\n\nG. Any patient confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the patient and the sending and receiving states agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.\n\nH. Any patient pursuant to the terms of this compact shall be subject to civil process and shall have all rights to sue, be sued and participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if in any appropriate facility of the sending state or being supervised therefrom, as the case may be, located within such state.\n\nI. The parent, guardian, trustee or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise or otherwise function with respect to any patient shall not be deprived of, or restricted in his exercise of, any power in respect of any patient pursuant to the terms of this compact.\n\nArticle 5 - Disposition of Charges\n\nA. Whenever the authorities responsible for the care and treatment of a mentally disordered offender, whether convicted or adjudicated in the state or subject to care, aftercare, treatment or rehabilitation pursuant to a contract, are of the opinion that charges based on untried indictments, informations or complaints in another party state present obstacles to the proper care and treatment of a mentally disordered offender or to the planning or execution of a suitable program for him, such authorities may petition the appropriate court in the state where the untried indictment, information or complaint is pending for prompt disposition thereof. If the mentally disordered offender is a patient in a receiving state, the appropriate authorities of the sending state, upon recommendation of the appropriate authorities in the receiving state, shall, if they concur in the recommendation, file the petition contemplated by this subarticle.\n\nB. The court shall hold a hearing on the petition within thirty days of the filing thereof. The hearing shall be only to determine whether the proper safeguarding and advancement of the public interest, the condition of the mentally disordered offender and the prospects for more satisfactory care, treatment and rehabilitation of him warrant disposition of the untried indictment, information or complaint prior to termination of the defendant's status as a mentally disordered offender in the sending state. The prosecuting officer of the jurisdiction from which the untried indictment, information or complaint is pending, the petitioning authorities and such other persons as the court may determine shall be entitled to be heard.\n\nC. Upon any hearing pursuant to this article, the court may order such adjournments or continuances as may be necessary for the examination or observation of the mentally disordered offender or for the securing of necessary evidence. In granting or denying any such adjournment or continuance, the court shall give primary consideration to the purposes of this compact, and more particularly to the need for expeditious determination of the legal and mental status of a mentally disordered offender so that his care, treatment and discharge to the community only under conditions which will be consonant with the public safety may be implemented.\n\nD. The presence of a mentally disordered offender within a state wherein a petition is pending or being heard pursuant to this article, or his presence within any other state through which he is being transported in connection with such petition or hearing, shall be only for the purposes of this compact, and no court, agency or person shall have or obtain jurisdiction over the mentally disordered offender for any other purpose by reason of his presence pursuant to this article. The mentally disordered offender shall, at all times, remain in the custody of the sending state. Any acts of officers, employees or agencies of the receiving state in providing or facilitating detention, housing or transportation for the mentally disordered offender shall be only as agents for the sending state.\n\nE. Promptly upon conclusion of the hearing, the court shall dismiss the untried indictment, information or complaint, if it finds that the purposes enumerated in Subarticle B of this article would be served thereby. Otherwise, the court shall make such order with respect to the petition and the untried indictment, information or complaint as may be appropriate in the circumstances and consistent with the status of the defendant as a mentally disordered offender in the custody of, and subject to the jurisdiction of, the sending state.\n\nF. No fact or other matter established or adjudicated at any hearing pursuant to this article or in connection therewith shall be deemed established or adjudicated, nor shall the same be admitted in evidence, in any subsequent prosecution of the untried indictment, information or complaint concerned in a petition filed pursuant to this article unless:\n\n(1) the defendant or his duly empowered legal representative requested or expressly acquiesced in the making of the petition, and was afforded an opportunity to participate in person in the hearing; or\n\n(2) the defendant himself offers or consents to the introduction of the determination or adjudication at such subsequent proceedings.\n\nArticle 6 - Acts Not Reviewable in Receiving State; Return\n\nA. Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon, and not reviewable within, the receiving state, but, if at the time the sending state seeks to remove a patient from the receiving state, there is pending against the patient within such state any criminal charge, or if the patient is suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the patient shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport patients pursuant to this compact through all states party to this compact without interference.\n\nB. A patient who escapes while receiving care and treatment, or who violates provisions of aftercare by leaving the jurisdiction, or while being detained or transported pursuant to this compact, shall be deemed an escapee from the sending state and from the state in which the facility is situated or the aftercare was being provided. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for return shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.\n\nArticle 7 - Federal Aid\n\nAny state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any facility or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant thereto, and any patient in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision, provided that, if such program or activity is not part of the customary regimen of the facility or program, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.\n\nArticle 8 - Entry into Force\n\nThis compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states from among the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states, or any other state, upon similar action by such state.\n\nArticle 9 - Withdrawal and Termination\n\nThis compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it has enacted a statute repealing the compact and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until two years after the notices provided in the statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such patients as it may have in other party states pursuant to the provisions of this compact.\n\nArticle 10 - Other Arrangements Unaffected\n\nNothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the custody, care, treatment, rehabilitation or aftercare of patients, nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative arrangements.\n\nArticle 11 - Construction and Severability\n\nThe provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, or sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact is held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in effect as to the remaining states and in effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-20-17, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 201, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For filing interstate compacts with supreme court librarian,see14-3-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nRights not created.— Provisions relating to mechanisms by which corrections officials can arrange to transfer inmates needing psychiatric care to an appropriate facility were not meant to create rights enforceable by inmates against state officials; thus, this section did not create a liberty interest subject to due process protections.Riddle v.

      "number": "31-5-12",
      "heading": "Agreement on Detainers.",
      "text": "The Agreement on Detainers is entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in a form substantially as follows:\n\nAGREEMENT ON DETAINERS\n\nArticle 1 - Findings\n\nThe party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.\n\nArticle 2 - Definitions\n\nAs used in this agreement:\n\nA. \"state\" means a state of the United States, the United States, a territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia or the commonwealth of Puerto Rico;\n\nB. \"sending state\" means a state in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time that he initiates a request for final disposition pursuant to Article 3 of this agreement or at the time that a request for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to Article 4 of this agreement; and\n\nC. \"receiving state\" means the state in which trial is to be had on an indictment, information or complaint pursuant to Article 3 or Article 4 of this agreement.\n\nArticle 3 - Prisoner's Request for Final Disposition\n\nA. Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty days after he has caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.\n\nB. The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in Subarticle A shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of him who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.\n\nC. The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information or complaint on which the detainer is based.\n\nD. Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to Subarticle A shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this subarticle shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\n\nE. Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to Subarticle A shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of Subarticle D, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon him, after completion of his term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this subarticle shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.\n\nF. Escape from custody by the prisoner subsequent to his execution of the request for final disposition referred to in Subarticle A shall void the request.\n\nArticle 4 - Prosecutor's Request for Final Disposition\n\nA. The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending is entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance with Article 5 A of this agreement upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated, but the court having jurisdiction of the indictment, information or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded and transmitted the request, and there shall be a period of thirty days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request is honored, within which period the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon his own motion or upon motion of the prisoner.\n\nB. Upon receipt of the officer's written request as provided in Subarticle A, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor.\n\nC. In respect of any proceeding made possible by this article, trial shall be commenced within one hundred twenty days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.\n\nD. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in Subarticle A, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery.\n\nE. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to Article 5 E of this agreement, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\n\nArticle 5 - Transfer of Custody\n\nA. In response to a request made under Article 3 or Article 4 of this agreement, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer to deliver temporary custody of the prisoner to the appropriate authority in the state where the indictment, information or complaint is pending against the person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had. If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in Article 3 of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner's presence in federal custody at the place for trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.\n\nB. The officer or other representative of a state accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present upon demand:\n\n(1) proper identification and evidence of his authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody the prisoner is to be given; and\n\n(2) a certified copy of the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been made.\n\nC. If the appropriate authority refuses or fails to accept temporary custody of the person, or if an action on the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in Article 3 or Article 4 of this agreement, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information or complaint had been pending shall enter an order dismissing it with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect.\n\nD. The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.\n\nE. At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.\n\nF. During the continuance of temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by this agreement, time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow.\n\nG. For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law.\n\nH. From the time that a party state receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until the prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending state, the state in which the one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints are pending or in which trial is being had shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping and returning the prisoner. The provisions of this subarticle govern unless the states concerned have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies and officers of an [and] in the government of a party state or between a party state and its subdivisions as to the payment of costs or responsibilities therefor.\n\nArticle 6 - Application\n\nA. In determining the duration and expiration dates of the time periods provided in Articles 3 and 4 of this agreement, the running of the time periods shall be tolled whenever and for as long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial, as determined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter.\n\nB. No provision of this agreement and no remedy made available by this agreement shall apply to any person who is adjudged to be mentally ill.\n\nArticle 7 - Compact Administrator\n\nEach state party to this agreement shall designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other party states, shall promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this agreement, and who shall provide, within and without the state, information necessary to the effective operation of this agreement.\n\nArticle 8 - Party States\n\nThis agreement shall enter into full force and effect as to a party state when such state has enacted the agreement into law. A state party to this agreement may withdraw herefrom by enacting a statute repealing this agreement. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not affect the status of any proceedings already initiated by inmates or by state officers at the time the withdrawal takes effect, nor shall it affect their rights in respect thereof.\n\nArticle 9 - Construction\n\nThis agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party hereto, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-20-19, enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 270, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For filing interstate compacts with supreme court librarian,see14-3-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nNot applicable to parolees.— The interstate agreement on detainers does not apply to parolees.State v. Frohnhofer, 2011-NMCA-109, 150 N.M. 643, 267 P.3d 78, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 903.\n\nWhere the state of New Mexico lodged a detainer against defendant; defendant requested a final disposition of the detainer; prior to the 180-day deadline, defendant was paroled in Colorado; and defendant's trial did not commence before the 180-deadline, the district court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss, because the interstate agreement on detainers did not apply to defendant who was a parolee.State v. Frohnhofer, 2011-NMCA-109, 150 N.M. 643, 267 P.3d 78, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 903.\n\nApplicability.— The Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act is an agreement between the governments of member states. The federal government also subscribes to the act and, for purposes of it, is considered a single state. It applies to transfers between states, not transfers within a state. Hence, it has no application if a prisoner in federal custody in one federal judicial district faces another federal indictment in a different federal judicial district.U.S. v. Walling, 974 F.2d 140 (10th Cir. 1992).\n\nApplicability.— The provisions of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act do not apply to pretrial detainees. U.S. v. Muniz, 1 F.3d 1018 (10th Cir. 1993)\n\nAgreement not applicable where detainer for sentencing only.— A request for the disposition of an outstanding sentencing is not cognizable under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers; the 180-day requirement of Paragraph A of Article 3 applies only where a detainer for \"trial\" is present, not where the detainer is only for sentencing.State v. Sparks, 1986-NMCA-010, 104 N.M. 62, 716 P.2d 253, cert. denied, 103 N.M. 798, 715 P.2d 71.\n\nProbation and parole proceedings.— This section does not apply to probation revocation proceedings.State v. McDonald, 1991-NMCA-132, 113 N.M. 305, 825 P.2d 238, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 44, 822 P.2d 1127 (1992).\n\nProbation and parole proceedings.— The Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act applies only to detainers lodged on untried criminal charges and has no applicability to probation or parole revocation detainers.McDonald v. N.M. Parole Bd., 955 F.2d 631 (10th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 920, 112 S. Ct. 1968, 118 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1992).\n\nPrisoner's burden of substantial compliance.— Where a prisoner bypasses the statutory procedure and attempts to communicate directly with the receiving state, absent actual notice by the receiving state, he or she has the burden of complying substantially with the requirements of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act.State v. Tarango, 1987-NMCA-027, 105 N.M. 592, 734 P.2d 1275, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 521, 734 P.2d 761,overruled on other grounds byZurla v. State, 1990-NMSC-011, 109 N.M. 640, 789 P.2d 588.\n\nSubstantial compliance.— Substantial compliance for purposes of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act means the prisoner must file the proper documents, including the certificate of status, with the proper prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction, using registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.State v. Tarango, 1987-NMCA-027, 105 N.M. 592, 734 P.2d 1275, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 521, 734 P.2d 761,overruled on other grounds by Zurla v. State, 1990-NMSC-011, 109 N.M. 640, 789 P.2d 588.\n\nThe defendant failed to meet the requirements of this section since his petition for a writ of habeas corpus requesting revocation of the Arizona arrest warrant and removal of detainer did not constitute a request for final disposition of detainer, and there was no evidence that he gave actual notice to Arizona, or otherwise substantially complied with the statutory requirements.Palmer v. Williams, 1995-NMSC-040, 120 N.M. 63, 897 P.2d 1111.\n\nThe defendant's letter to the district attorney's office stating, \"Were you to file a detainer . . ., I could request final disposition\" was inadequate to activate his rights under the Interstate Agreement for Detainers Act.State v. Morawe, 1996-NMCA-110, 122 N.M. 489, 927 P.2d 44.\n\nActual notice of critical information required.— While the defendant did not have to furnish the certificate required by Paragraph A of Article 3 to give the prosecutor and the district court actual notice, he did have an obligation to furnish the information that would be contained therein. Since the county prosecutor and the district court did not have actual notice of critical information, such as the fact that the defendant was presently incarcerated in the Texas penal complex, the defendant was not relieved of his burden of substantially complying with the requirements of this agreement.State v. Smith, 1993-NMCA-070, 115 N.M. 749, 858 P.2d 416, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 795, 858 P.2d 1274.\n\nInvocation of protections.— Writs of habeas corpus ad prosequendum will not, by themselves, invoke the protections of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.State v. Montoya, 1994-NMCA-155, 119 N.M. 95, 888 P.2d 977, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 168, 889 P.2d 203 (1995).\n\nExpiration of 180-day period on Sunday.— Where the 180-day limitation period of Paragraph A of Article 3 expires on a Sunday, a trial is timely if held the next day.State v. Alderete, 1980-NMCA-084, 95 N.M. 691, 625 P.2d 1208, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 674, 615 P.2d 991.\n\nTime limitation tolled only when prisoner unable to stand trial or on continuance for good cause.— The time limitations of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (Section 31-5-12 NMSA 1978) are intended to permit sufficient time and opportunity for the disposition of all pretrial proceedings and the commencement of trial before the time limitations expire. Time is tolled only when the prisoner is \"unable to stand trial\"; in all other circumstances, the mechanism for reasonably or necessarily extending the time limits is by a request for continuance \"for good cause shown.\"State v. Shaw, 1982-NMCA-133, 98 N.M. 580, 651 P.2d 115.\n\nEvidence of \"for good cause shown\".— Continuances because of the unavailability of a trial judge, where the assigned judge was elected to the supreme court and the other judges in the district had a full complement of cases, and because of a local rule which required the assignment of all cases involving a single defendant to one judge were \"for good cause shown,\" pursuant to Paragraph A of Article 3 of this section.State v. Aaron, 1984-NMCA-124, 102 N.M. 187, 692 P.2d 1336.\n\nGood cause for continuance.— The state had good cause to request a continuation beyond the 120-day limit for commencement of the defendant's trial based on its discovery that the grand jury that indicted the defendant included an unsworn juror, a deficiency that required additional time to correct.State v. Livernois, 1997-NMSC-019, 123 N.M. 128, 934 P.2d 1057.\n\nContinuation of trial date does not violate 180-day period.— Where a trial has in fact been continued although there is no formal order continuing the trial date, the 180-day limitation period of Paragraph A of Article 3 is not violated.State v. Alderete, 1980-NMCA-084, 95 N.M. 691, 625 P.2d 1208, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 674, 615 P.2d 991.\n\nThe timing of defendant's trial did not violate the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.— Where defendant was charged with murder, tampering with evidence and conspiracy to commit tampering with evidence, and where defendant moved to dismiss all charges with prejudice because his trial occurred outside of the 180-day time period generally prescribed by the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) and because there was not good cause for a continuance, the district court acted within its discretion by concluding that the complexity of the case and the volume of discovery amounted to good cause for a continuance.State v. Chavez, 2022-NMCA-007, cert. granted.\n\nState's representation that it will reindict is not a de facto continuanceunder Paragraph A of Article 3.State v. Shaw, 1982-NMCA-133, 98 N.M. 580, 651 P.2d 115.\n\nTime period does not commence anew upon refiling of indictment.— A second indictment on the identical charges for which a defendant was previously returned to New Mexico for pretrial and trial proceedings cannot avoid the time restrictions of Paragraph A of Article 3 on the theory that the time commences anew from the filing of the second indictment.State v. Shaw, 1982-NMCA-133, 98 N.M. 580, 651 P.2d 115.\n\nWhen defendant's request for final disposition does not trigger 180-day rule.— Where the defendant wrote the district attorney in Albuquerque to request a final disposition of pending Arizona charges on the same day that he pleaded guilty to California felony charges, he had not entered upon \"term of imprisonment\" within this section; therefore, his request did not trigger section's requirement of trial within 180 days after request for disposition of the charge.State v. Duncan, 1980-NMCA-162, 95 N.M. 215, 619 P.2d 1259.\n\nTriggering the 180 day provision.— The Interstate Agreement for Detainers Act becomes effective only when a detainer is filed, and a letter sent by the defendant to the district attorney's office before issuance of the detainer was insufficient to trigger the 180-day trial provision.State v. Morawe, 1996-NMCA-110, 122 N.M. 489, 927 P.2d 44.\n\nNot applicable to sentencing.— Because the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act does not apply to sentencing and because a habitual offender proceeding addresses sentence enhancement, a defendant held in prison in another state does not have a right to a final disposition of habitual offender status within 180 days of serving a request for a final disposition.State v. Padilla, 2006-NMCA-070, 139 N.M. 700, 137 P.3d 640, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-006, 140 N.M. 224, 141 P.3d 1278.\n\nWaiver of time limits.— Although the defendant did not specifically request a waiver of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act time limitations, such a waiver was implied from the defendant's waiver of all speedy trial time limitations.State v. Montoya, 1994-NMCA-155, 119 N.M. 95, 888 P.2d 977, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 168, 889 P.2d 203 (1995).\n\nAgreement not pertinent following absolute release of prisoner.— When a sending state absolutely releases a prisoner within 120 days of his arrival in the receiving state, provisions of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act cease to be pertinent.State v. Quiroz, 1980-NMCA-039, 94 N.M. 517, 612 P.2d 1328, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 675, 615 P.2d 992.\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico criminal procedure, see 16 N.M.L. Rev. 25 (1986).\n\nAm.

      "text": "The Interstate Corrections Compact is enacted into law and entered into by New Mexico with any other states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\nArticle 1. Purpose and Policy\n\nThe party states, desiring by common action to fully utilize and improve their institutional facilities and provide adequate programs for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of various types of offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to provide such facilities and programs on a basis of cooperation with one another, thereby serving the best interests of such offenders and of society and effecting economies in capital expenditures and operational costs. The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources.\n\nArticle 2. Definitions\n\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:\n\nA. \"state\" means a state of the United States, the United States of America, a territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia or the commonwealth of Puerto Rico;\n\nB. \"sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had;\n\nC. \"receiving state\" means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction or court commitment was had;\n\nD. \"inmate\" means a male or female offender who is committed under sentence to or confined in a penal or correctional institution; and\n\nE. \"institution\" means any penal or correctional facility, including but not limited to a facility for the mentally ill or mentally defective, in which inmates may lawfully be confined.\n\nArticle 3. Contracts\n\nA. Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states. Any such contract shall provide for:\n\n(1) its duration;\n\n(2) payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance;\n\n(3) participation in programs of inmate employment, if any; the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account thereof; and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting therefrom;\n\n(4) delivery and retaking of inmates; and\n\n(5) such other matters as may be necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states.\n\nB. The terms and provisions of this compact shall be a part of any contract entered into by the authority of or pursuant thereto, and nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith.\n\nArticle 4. Procedures and Rights\n\nA. Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article 3, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.\n\nB. The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution.\n\nC. Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article 3.\n\nD. Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state.\n\nE. All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state.\n\nF. Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.\n\nG. Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.\n\nH. Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state.\n\nI. The parent, guardian, trustee or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact.\n\nArticle 5. Acts Not Reviewable in Receiving State: Extradition\n\nA. Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.\n\nB. An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.\n\nArticle 6. Federal Aid\n\nAny state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision, provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.\n\nArticle 7. Entry into Force\n\nThis compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such state.\n\nArticle 8. Withdrawal and Termination\n\nThis compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.\n\nArticle 9. Other Arrangements Unaffected\n\nNothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.\n\nArticle 10. Construction and Severability\n\nThe provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 56, § 1.",

The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community and is authorized pursuant to the bylaws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner and, when necessary, return offenders to the originating jurisdictions.

Section 112, 1965, has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.\n\nB. It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states:\n\n(1) to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protection of the rights of victims in the community through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders;\n\n(2) to provide for the effective tracking, supervision and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and\n\n(3) to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.\n\nC.

The interstate commission shall have all the responsibilities, powers and duties set forth herein, including the power to sue and be sued and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the compacting states in accordance with the terms of this compact. The interstate commission shall consist of commissioners selected and appointed by resident members of a state council for interstate adult offender supervision for each state. In addition to the commissioners who are the voting representatives of each state, the interstate commission shall include individuals who are not commissioners but who are members of interested organizations; such non-commissioner members must include a member of the national organizations of governors, legislators, state chief justices, attorneys general and crime victims.

Each state council shall appoint as its commissioner the compact administrator from that state to serve on the interstate commission in such capacity under or pursuant to applicable law of the compacting state. While each compacting state may determine the membership of its own state council, its membership must include at least one representative from the legislative, judicial and executive branches of government and victims groups and its compact administrator. Each compacting state retains the right to determine the qualifications of the compact administrator who shall be appointed by the state council or by the governor in consultation with the legislature and the judiciary. In addition to appointment of its commissioner to the interstate commission, each state council shall exercise oversight and advocacy concerning its participation in interstate commission activities and other duties as may be determined by each compacting state, including development of policy concerning operations and procedures of the compact within that state.\n\nARTICLE V - Powers and Duties of the Interstate Commission\n\nThe interstate commission shall have the following powers:\n\nA. to adopt a seal and suitable bylaws governing the management and operation of the interstate commission;\n\nB. to promulgate rules that shall have the force and effect of statutory law and shall be binding in the compacting states to the extent and in the manner provided in this compact;\n\nC. to oversee, supervise and coordinate the interstate movement of offenders subject to the terms of this compact and any bylaws adopted and rules promulgated by the interstate commission;\n\nD. to enforce compliance with compact provisions and interstate commission rules and bylaws, using all necessary and proper means, including the use of judicial process;\n\nE. to establish and maintain offices;\n\nF. to purchase and maintain insurance and bonds;\n\nG. to borrow, accept or contract for services of personnel, including members and their staffs;\n\nH. to establish and appoint committees and hire staff that it deems necessary for the carrying out of its functions, including an executive committee as required by Article III that shall have the power to act on behalf of the interstate commission in carrying out its powers and duties hereunder;\n\nI. to elect or appoint such officers, attorneys, employees, agents or consultants and to fix their compensation, define their duties and determine their qualifications; and to establish the interstate commission's personnel policies and programs relating to, among other things, conflicts of interest, rates of compensation and qualifications of personnel;\n\nJ. to accept any and all donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services and to receive, utilize and dispose of same;\n\nK. to lease, purchase, accept contributions or donations of, or otherwise to own, hold, improve or use any property, real, personal or mixed;\n\nL. to sell, convey, mortgage, pledge, lease, exchange, abandon or otherwise dispose of any property, real, personal or mixed;\n\nM. to establish a budget and make expenditures and levy dues as provided in Article X of this compact;\n\nN. to sue and be sued;\n\nO. to provide for dispute resolution among compacting states;\n\nP. to perform such functions as may be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this compact;\n\nQ. to report annually to the legislatures, governors, judiciary and state councils of the compacting states concerning the activities of the interstate commission during the preceding year. The reports shall also include any recommendations that may have been adopted by the interstate commission;\n\nR. to coordinate education, training and public awareness regarding the interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity; and\n\nS. to establish uniform standards for the reporting, collecting and exchanging of data.\n\nARTICLE VI - Organization and Operation of the Interstate Commission\n\nA. The interstate commission shall, by a majority of the members, within twelve months of the first interstate commission meeting, adopt bylaws to govern its conduct as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the compact, including:\n\n(1) establishing the fiscal year of the interstate commission;\n\n(2) establishing an executive committee and such other committees as may be necessary;\n\n(3) providing reasonable standards and procedures:\n\n(a) for the establishment of committees; and\n\n(b) for any general or specific delegation of any authority or function of the interstate commission;\n\n(4) providing reasonable procedures for calling and conducting meetings of the interstate commission and ensuring reasonable notice of each such meeting;\n\n(5) establishing the titles and responsibilities of the officers of the interstate commission;\n\n(6) providing reasonable standards and procedures for the establishment of the personnel policies and programs of the interstate commission. Notwithstanding any civil service or other similar laws of any compacting state, the bylaws shall exclusively govern the personnel policies and programs of the interstate commission;\n\n(7) providing a mechanism for winding-up the operations of the interstate commission and for the equitable return of any surplus funds that may exist upon the termination of the compact after the payment and reserving of all of its debts and obligations;\n\n(8) providing transition rules for \"start-up\" administration of the compact; and\n\n(9) establishing standards and procedures for compliance and technical assistance in carrying out the compact.\n\nB. The interstate commission shall, by a majority of the members, elect from among its members a chairperson and a vice chairperson, each of whom shall have such authorities and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The chairperson or, in his absence or disability, the vice chairperson, shall preside at all meetings of the interstate commission. The officers so elected shall serve without compensation or remuneration from the interstate commission; provided that, subject to the availability of budgeted funds, the officers shall be reimbursed for any actual and necessary costs and expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties and responsibilities as officers of the interstate commission. The interstate commission shall, through its executive committee, appoint or retain an executive director for such period, upon such terms and conditions and for such compensation as the interstate commission may deem appropriate. The executive director shall serve as secretary to the interstate commission, and hire and supervise such other staff as may be authorized by the interstate commission, but shall not be a member.\n\nC. The interstate commission shall maintain its corporate books and records in accordance with the bylaws.\n\nD. The members, officers, executive director and employees of the interstate commission shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of any such person. The interstate commission shall defend the commissioner of a compacting state, or his representatives or employees or the interstate commission's representatives or employees, in any civil action seeking to impose liability, arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from intentional wrongdoing on the part of such person. The interstate commission shall indemnify and hold the commissioner of a compacting state, the appointed designee or employees or the interstate commission's representatives or employees, harmless in the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against such persons arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing on the part of such person.\n\nARTICLE VII - Activities of the Interstate Commission\n\nA. The interstate commission shall meet and take such actions as are consistent with the provisions of this compact.\n\nB. Except as otherwise provided in this compact and unless a greater percentage is required by the bylaws, in order to constitute an act of the interstate commission such act shall have been taken at a meeting of the interstate commission and shall have received an affirmative vote of a majority of the members present.\n\nC. Each member of the interstate commission shall have the right and power to cast a vote to which that compacting state is entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the interstate commission. A member shall vote in person on behalf of the compacting state and shall not delegate a vote to another compacting state. However, a state council shall appoint another authorized representative, in the absence of the commissioner from that state, to cast a vote on behalf of the compacting state at a specified meeting. The bylaws may provide for members' participation in meetings by telephone or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication. Any voting conducted by telephone, or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication shall be subject to the same quorum requirements of meetings where members are present in person.\n\nD. The interstate commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year. The chairperson of the interstate commission may call additional meetings at any time and, upon the request of a majority of the members, shall call additional meetings.\n\nE. The interstate commission's bylaws shall establish conditions and procedures under which the interstate commission shall make its information and official records available to the public for inspection or copying. The interstate commission may exempt from disclosure any information or official records to the extent they would adversely affect personal privacy rights or proprietary interests. In promulgating such rules, the interstate commission may make available to law enforcement agencies records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with law enforcement agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to non-disclosure and confidentiality provisions.\n\nF. Public notice shall be given of all meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the rules or as otherwise provided in the compact. The interstate commission shall promulgate rules consistent with the principles contained in the federal Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552(b), as may be amended. The interstate commission and any of its committees may close a meeting to the public where it determines by a two-thirds' vote that a meeting would be likely to:\n\n(1) relate solely to the interstate commission's internal personnel practices and procedures;\n\n(2) disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute;\n\n(3) disclose trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential;\n\n(4) involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;\n\n(5) disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;\n\n(6) disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes;\n\n(7) disclose information contained in or related to examination, operating or condition reports prepared by, or on behalf of or for the use of, the interstate commission with respect to a regulated entity for the purpose of regulation or supervision of such entity;\n\n(8) disclose information, the premature disclosure of which would significantly endanger the life of a person or the stability of a regulated entity; or\n\n(9) specifically relate to the interstate commission's issuance of a subpoena or its participation in a civil action or proceeding.\n\nG. For every meeting closed pursuant to this provision, the interstate commission's chief legal officer shall publicly certify that, in his opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public, and shall reference each relevant exemptive provision. The interstate commission shall keep minutes that shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in any meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll-call vote, reflected in the vote of each member on the question. All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in the minutes.\n\nH. The interstate commission shall collect standardized data concerning the interstate movement of offenders as directed through its bylaws and rules, which shall specify the data to be collected, the means of collection and data exchange and reporting requirements.\n\nARTICLE VIII - Rulemaking Functions of the Interstate Commission\n\nA. The interstate commission shall promulgate rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact, including transition rules governing administration of the compact during the period in which it is being considered and enacted by the states. Rulemaking shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the bylaws and rules adopted pursuant thereto. Such rulemaking shall substantially conform to the principles of the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 551 et seq., and the federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 1 et seq., as may be amended. All rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment.\n\nB. If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.\n\nC. When promulgating a rule, the interstate commission shall:\n\n(1) publish the proposed rule stating with particularity the text of the rule that is proposed and the reason for the proposed rule;\n\n(2) allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which information shall be publicly available;\n\n(3) provide an opportunity for an informal hearing; and\n\n(4) promulgate a final rule and its effective date, if appropriate, based on the rulemaking record.\n\nD. Not later than sixty days after a rule is promulgated, any interested person may file a petition in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or in the federal district court where the interstate commission's principal office is located for judicial review of such rule. If the court finds that the interstate commission's action is not supported by substantial evidence, as defined in the Administrative Procedure Act, in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the rule unlawful and set it aside. Subjects to be addressed within twelve months after the first meeting must at a minimum include:\n\n(1) notice to victims and opportunity to be heard;\n\n(2) offender registration and compliance;\n\n(3) violations or returns;\n\n(4) transfer procedures and forms;\n\n(5) eligibility for transfer;\n\n(6) collection of restitution and fees from offenders;\n\n(7) data collection and reporting;\n\n(8) the level of supervision to be provided by the receiving state;\n\n(9) transition rules governing the operation of the compact and the interstate commission during all or part of the period between the effective date of the compact and the date on which the last eligible state adopts the compact; and\n\n(10) mediation, arbitration and dispute resolution.\n\nE. The existing rules governing the operation of the previous compact superseded by this compact shall be null and void twelve months after the first meeting of the interstate commission created hereunder.\n\nF. Upon determination by the interstate commission that an emergency exists, it may promulgate an emergency rule that shall become effective immediately upon adoption, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided hereunder shall be retroactively applied to said rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of the rule.\n\nARTICLE IX - Oversight, Enforcement, and Dispute Resolution by the Interstate Commission\n\nA. The interstate commission shall oversee the interstate movement of adult offenders in the compacting states and shall monitor such activities being administered in non-compacting states that may significantly affect compacting states. The courts and executive agencies in each compacting state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. In any judicial or administrative proceeding in a compacting state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact that may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the interstate commission, the interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.\n\nB. The compacting states shall report to the interstate commission on issues or activities of concern to them and cooperate with and support the interstate commission in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities. The interstate commission shall attempt to resolve any disputes or other issues that are subject to the compact and that may arise among compacting states and non-compacting states. The interstate commission shall enact a bylaw or promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes among the compacting states.\n\nC. The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this compact using any or all means set forth in Section B of Article XII of this compact.\n\nARTICLE X - Finance\n\nA. The interstate commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activities.\n\nB. The interstate commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each compacting state to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the interstate commission and its staff that must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the interstate commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate commission, taking into consideration the population of the compacting state and the volume of interstate movement of offenders in each compacting state and shall promulgate a rule binding upon all compacting states that governs said assessment.\n\nC. The interstate commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the interstate commission pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state.\n\nD. The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the interstate commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the interstate commission.\n\nARTICLE XI - Compacting States, Effective Date and Amendment\n\nA. Any state is eligible to become a compacting state. The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than thirty-five of the states. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2001, or upon enactment into law by the thirty-fifth state. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding, as to any other compacting state, upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of non-compacting states or their designees will be invited to participate in interstate commission activities on a non-voting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.\n\nB. Amendments to the compact may be proposed by the interstate commission for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the compacting states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.\n\nARTICLE XII - Withdrawal, Default, Termination and Judicial Enforcement\n\nA. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; provided that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute that enacted the compact into law. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal. The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The interstate commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt thereof. The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the interstate commission.\n\nB. If the interstate commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws or any duly promulgated rules, the interstate commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:\n\n(1) fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the interstate commission;\n\n(2) remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the interstate commission; and\n\n(3) suspension and termination of membership in the compact. Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and the state council.\n\nThe grounds for default include failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, interstate commission bylaws or duly promulgated rules. The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default. The interstate commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the interstate commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension. Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the interstate commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer and the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and the state council of such termination. The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination. The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the interstate commission and the defaulting state. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a re-enactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.\n\nC. The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its duly promulgated rules and bylaws against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.\n\nD. The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state, which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be wound-up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.\n\nARTICLE XIII - Severability and Construction\n\nA. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.\n\nB. The provisions of this compact shall be liberally constructed to effectuate its purposes.\n\nARTICLE XIV - Binding Effect of Compact and Other Laws\n\nA. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact. All compacting states' laws conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\nB. All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the interstate commission, are binding upon the compacting states. All agreements between the interstate commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms. Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of interstate commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the interstate commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation. In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the interstate commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.\n\nHistory:Laws 2001, ch. 322, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 2001, ch. 322, art. XI provided that the compact becomes effective on the latter of July 1, 2001, or enactment of the compact into law by the thirty-fifth jurisdiction. As of June 19, 2002, 35 states had entered the compact.",
