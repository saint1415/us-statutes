      "text": "A. Persons sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one year or more shall be imprisoned in a corrections facility designated by the corrections department, unless a new trial is granted or a portion of the sentence is suspended so as to provide for imprisonment for not more than eighteen months; then the imprisonment may be in such place of incarceration, other than a corrections facility under the jurisdiction of the corrections department, as the sentencing judge, in his discretion, may prescribe; provided that a sentence of imprisonment for one year or more but not more than eighteen months shall be subject to the provisions of Subsections D and E of this section and shall not be imposed unless the requirements set forth in Subsection D of this section are satisfied.\n\nB. All commitments, judgments and orders of the courts of this state for the imprisonment or release of persons in the penitentiary shall run to the corrections department, but nothing contained in this section shall invalidate or impair the validity of any commitment, judgment or order of any court in this state directed to the secretary of corrections, the warden of the penitentiary of New Mexico or to the penitentiary of New Mexico, and all such commitments, judgments and orders shall be treated and construed as running to the corrections department.\n\nC. There is created within the corrections department an \"intake and classification center\". The intake and classification center shall have the following duties:\n\n(1) process all inmates sentenced or committed for purposes of diagnosis to the corrections department;\n\n(2) classify inmates for housing assignments;\n\n(3) develop an individualized plan for participation by each inmate in programs, work assignments and special needs;\n\n(4) monitor each inmate's progress during incarceration and reclassify or modify classification assignments as may be necessary, taking into consideration the overall needs of the inmate population, institutional and facility requirements and the individual inmate's needs;\n\n(5) with the approval of the secretary of corrections, may transfer inmates of the penitentiary to an institution under the control of another state if that state has entered into a corrections control agreement with New Mexico; and\n\n(6) with the approval of the secretary of corrections, may transfer inmates to any facility, including the forensic hospital under the jurisdiction of the department of health.\n\nD. A sentence of one year or more but not more than eighteen months and providing for imprisonment in a place of incarceration other than a corrections facility under the jurisdiction of the corrections department pursuant to Subsection A of this section, which shall be known as the local sentencing option, shall not be imposed unless:\n\n(1) the place of incarceration is located within the county in which the crime was committed; and\n\n(2) the governing authority in charge of the place of incarceration has entered into a joint powers agreement with the corrections department setting forth:\n\n(a) the amount of money the corrections department shall pay for offenders sentenced to a term of one year or more but not more than eighteen months and the number of offenders which may be sentenced to such terms; and\n\n(b) any other provisions deemed appropriate and agreed to by the local governing body and the corrections department.\n\nE. If a judge imposes a sentence of one year or more but not more than eighteen months and provides for imprisonment in a place of incarceration other than a corrections facility under the jurisdiction of the corrections department:\n\n(1) the local governing body or its agent shall have the ability to petition that judge when the capacity of the place of incarceration is filled or when any problem develops concerning that offender requesting the judge to issue an order committing the offender to the corrections department for completion of the remainder of his sentence. A hearing on a petition pursuant to this paragraph shall be held within three days of the filing of the petition. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the judge shall retain jurisdiction over the offender for the purpose of implementing the local sentencing option; and\n\n(2) the local governing body or its agent shall keep the district judges for the judicial district in which the place of incarceration is located informed as to the capacity for the sentencing of offenders in accordance with the local sentencing option. No judge shall sentence an offender in accordance with the local sentencing option if that sentence will result in exceeding the number of offenders set forth in the joint powers agreement.\n\nF. The corrections department shall file an annual report with the legislature which shall contain the number of joint powers agreements in operation pursuant to this section, copies of those agreements, the number of offenders currently incarcerated pursuant to those agreements and any other relevant information relating to the implementation of this section.\n\nG. The corrections department may enter into contracts with public or private detention facilities for the purpose of housing inmates lawfully committed to the corrections department. Any facility with which the department contracts shall meet or exceed corrections department standards prior to the housing of any inmates within the facility and shall meet certification requirements for prisons within eighteen months of entering into such contracts. The contractor shall adhere to all appropriate corrections department policies and procedures and shall agree to have staff trained at the corrections department training academy.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-29-13, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 29-13; 1972, ch. 71, § 3; 1973, ch. 383, § 1; and recompiled as 1953 Comp., § 40A-29-37, by Laws 1977, ch. 216, § 16; 1978, ch. 106, § 1; 1981, ch. 9, § 1; 1987, ch. 51, § 1; 1993, ch. 81, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For Interstate Corrections Compact,see31-5-17 and 31-5-18 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor contracts with the United States attorney general for the housing of convicted offenders,see31-5-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor judgment of imprisonment for more than one year to be in corrections facility,see33-2-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor determination of sentence upon several commitments,see33-2-39 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, substituted \"contained in this section\" for \"herein contained\" and \"secretary of corrections\" for \"superintendent\" in Subsection B; substituted \"department of health\" for \"health and environment department\" in Subsection C(6); substituted \"this section\" for \"this act\" in two places in Subsection F; and added Subsection G.\n\nLiability for cost of incarceration in county jail.— The department of corrections is responsible for the costs of housing parole violators who are incarcerated in a county jail at the request of the department of corrections.State ex rel., San Miguel Bd of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Williams, 2007-NMCA-036, 141 N. M. 356, 155 P.3d 761, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-003, 141 N.M. 401, 156 P.3d 39.\n\nThe provisions of Subsection D are mandatory,not discretionary.State v. Ruiz, 1989-NMCA-109, 109 N.M. 437, 786 P.2d 51, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 419, 785 P.2d 1038 (1990).\n\nOnce the defendant's plea is accepted and judgment entered, court has four options:(1) it can sentence the defendant and execute the sentence, committing him to prison; (2) it can commit the defendant for a 60-day diagnostic term; (3) it can sentence the defendant and suspend the execution of the sentence; or (4) it can enter an order deferring the imposition of the sentence.State v. Kenneman, 1982-NMCA-145, 98 N.M. 794, 653 P.2d 170, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 47, 653 P.2d 878.\n\nRights not created.— Provisions relating to mechanisms by which corrections officials can arrange to transfer inmates needing psychiatric care to an appropriate facility were not meant to create rights enforceable by inmates against state officials; thus, this section did not create a liberty interest subject to due process protections.Riddle v. Mondragon, 83 F.3d 1197 (10th Cir. 1996).\n\nOrder committing defendant to state hospital for indeterminate period not valid sentence.— An order directing that the defendant be transported to the state hospital for an indeterminate period and then be returned to the district court for sentencing is not a valid sentence permitted by law, nor does it constitute a final judgment and sentence for purposes of an appeal.State v. Garcia, 1983-NMCA-017, 99 N.M. 466, 659 P.2d 918.\n\nEffect of commitment flaws on judgment.— Valid judgment is not to be nullified by the flaws in the commitment.Shankle v. Woodruff, 1958-NMSC-054, 64 N.M. 88, 324 P.2d 1017.\n\nEffect of misnomer.— Prisoners were not denied habeas corpus where they were sentenced to the \"New Mexico penitentiary\" instead of \"to the penitentiary of New Mexico\" because the misnomer, if one existed, was a clerical error which did not affect any substantial right of the appellants.Carter v. New Mexico, 358 F.2d 710 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 873, 87 S. Ct. 146, 17 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1966).\n\nEffect of section where one-year maximum sentence.— Where defendant has a valid maximum sentence of not more than one year, under Section 33-2-19 NMSA 1978 or this section, the proper place of his confinement is the state penitentiary.State v. Sawyers, 1968-NMCA-051, 79 N.M. 557, 445 P.2d 978.\n\nCalculation of sentence.— Under Section 33-2-19 NMSA 1978, defendant's sentence to one year would be calculated as a sentence of less than one year after crediting his pre-sentence time served; thus, the law did not require the court to sentence him to prison, and his sentence to jail was legal.State v. Brown, 1999-NMSC-004, 126 N.M. 642, 974 P.2d 136.\n\nTransfer from New Mexico to Texas.— Because a transfer of prisoners from New Mexico to Texas does not affect the duration of a sentence, a transfer must impose an atypical or a significant hardship before it can be held to create a liberty interest under state law.Jordan v. Bowles, No. 96-2169, 124 F.3d 217 (Table) (unpublished) (10th Cir. 1997).\n\nConfinement in county jail held improper.— District court lacked authority to order defendant confined in the county jail, where defendant's \"sentence\" was the one-year term imposed by the judgment of the district court, not the 363 days remaining to be served on that sentence after imposition of the sentence.State v. Ruiz, 1989-NMCA-109, 109 N.M. 437, 786 P.2d 51, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 419, 785 P.2d 1038 (1990).\n\nContracting with counties for housing of inmates.— Corrections department cannot contract with counties for the housing of inmates committed to the department. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-53.\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico criminal procedure, see 16 N.M.L. Rev. 25 (1986).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 21 Am.

      "text": "Upon entry of a judgment of conviction of any crime not constituting a capital or first degree felony, any court having jurisdiction when it is satisfied that the ends of justice and the best interest of the public as well as the defendant will be served thereby, may either:\n\nA. enter an order deferring the imposition of sentence;\n\nB. sentence the defendant and enter an order suspending in whole or in part the execution of the sentence; or\n\nC. commit the convicted person, if convicted of a felony and not committed for diagnostic purposes within the twelve-month period immediately preceding that conviction, to the department of corrections [corrections department] for an indeterminate period not to exceed sixty days for purposes of diagnosis, with direction that the court be given a report when the diagnosis is complete as to what disposition appears best when the interest of the public and the individual are evaluated.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-29-15, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 29-15; 1971, ch. 204, § 4; and recompiled as 1953 Comp., § 40A-29-39, by Laws 1977, ch. 216, § 16; 1985, ch. 159, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material in Subsection C was inserted by the compiler, as Laws 1977, ch. 257, § 4, abolished the department of corrections. Laws 1977, ch. 257, § 14, transferred all employees, equipment, etc., of this department to the criminal justice department. Laws 1980, ch. 150, § 3, changed the name of this department to the \"corrections and criminal rehabilitations department.\" Laws 1981, ch. 73, § 1, changed the name of this department to the \"corrections department.\"See9-3-3 NMSA 1978. The bracketed material is not part of the law.\n\nConstitutionality.— Laws 1909, ch. 32, § 1 (repealed), giving court power to suspend sentences, did not encroach upon constitutional power of execution to grant reprieves and pardons.Ex parte Bates, 1915-NMSC-060, 20 N.M. 542, 151 P. 698.\n\nIt is solely within province of legislature to establish penalties for criminal behavior.State v. Lack, 1982-NMCA-111, 98 N.M. 500, 650 P.2d 22, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 478, 649 P.2d 1391.\n\nOnce the defendant's plea is accepted and judgment entered, court has four options:(1) it can sentence the defendant and execute the sentence, committing him to prison; (2) it can commit the defendant for a 60-day diagnostic term; (3) it can sentence the defendant and suspend the execution of the sentence; or (4) it can enter an order deferring the imposition of the sentence.State v. Kenneman, 1982-NMCA-145, 98 N.M. 794, 653 P.2d 170, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 47, 653 P.2d 878.\n\nPrior conviction, not prior sentence, is dispositive for repeat offender status.— Where defendant was convicted of drug charges in New Mexico; the New Mexico court deferred defendant's sentence for a two-year probationary period; the sentence was a final judgment subject to appeal; and after defendant successfully completed the probation, defendant was entitled to have the New Mexico charges dismissed, the deferred sentence was a prior conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement.United States v. Meraz, 998 F.2d 182 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nDeferred sentence modified to conditional discharge.— Modification from a deferred sentence to a conditional discharge was an authorized sentence reduction under this section and Rule 5-801 NMRA.State v. Herbstman, 1999-NMCA-014, 126 N.M. 683, 974 P.2d 177.\n\nMandatory sentencing does not violate doctrine of separation of powerscontained in N.M. Const., art. III, § 1.State v. Mabry, 1981-NMSC-067, 96 N.M. 317, 630 P.2d 269.\n\nEffect of excepting sentencing for capital or first-degree felony.— The exception of capital or first-degree felonies from the list of the offenses for which the court may defer or suspend all or a portion of a sentence does not make sentencing for capital or first-degree felonies unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment.State v. Garcia, 1983-NMCA-069, 100 N.M. 120, 666 P.2d 1267, cert. denied, 100 N.M. 192, 668 P.2d 308.\n\nSentencing scheme for suspension and deferment is not unconstitutionally vague.State v. Kenneman, 1982-NMCA-145, 98 N.M. 794, 653 P.2d 170, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 47, 653 P.2d 878.\n\nJurisdiction to increase punishment by new sentence.— A trial court is without power to set aside a valid sentence after the defendant has been committed thereunder, and impose a new or different sentence increasing the punishment. A judgment which attempts to do so is void and the original judgment remains in force.State v. Baros, 1968-NMSC-001, 78 N.M. 623, 435 P.2d 1005.\n\nSuspended or deferred sentence within court's discretion.— Of the sentencing alternatives available, a suspended or deferred sentence is within the discretion of the trial court.State v. Madrigal, 1973-NMCA-116, 85 N.M. 496, 513 P.2d 1278, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 483, 513 P.2d 1265.\n\nSuspension matter of clemency.— Suspension of a sentence is a matter of clemency committed to the discretion of the trial court.Ewing v. State, 1969-NMCA-080, 80 N.M. 558, 458 P.2d 810.\n\nSuspension not a matter of right.— Suspension or deferment of sentence is not a matter of right but is an act of clemency and committed to the discretion of the trial court.State v. Serrano, 1966-NMSC-166, 76 N.M. 655, 417 P.2d 795.\n\nSuspension within court's discretion.— The suspension of execution of a sentence, or any portion thereof, is not a matter of right in the defendant, but is a matter of clemency committed to the discretion of the sentencing court in the criminal proceedings.State v. Knight, 1967-NMSC-241, 78 N.M. 482, 432 P.2d 838.\n\nNo authority to defer until conviction.— The court has no power or authority to defer a sentence and impose obligations of probation upon a person charged with a crime, until that person is convicted of the crime.State v. Apodaca, 1969-NMCA-020, 80 N.M. 155, 452 P.2d 489.\n\nExpress adjudication of guilt not needed.— An express adjudication of conviction, or finding of guilt, is not necessary if it is apparent from other matters in the record that the court made a judicial determination of conviction or guilt.State v. Apodaca, 1969-NMCA-020, 80 N.M. 155, 452 P.2d 489.\n\nEffect of nolo contendere plea.— Upon the acceptance of the plea of nolo contendere and entry of \"judgment and sentence,\" by which the court deferred sentence and imposed conditions of probation, there was a determination of guilt, or a pronouncement of judgment.State v. Apodaca, 1969-NMCA-020, 80 N.M. 155, 452 P.2d 489.\n\nEffect of sentence deferral.— An order deferring sentence in no way represents a suspension or a final sentence, at least for purposes of jurisdiction. Where deferral is ordered for the purpose of additional evaluation as recommended by department of corrections, a statutory sentence subsequently imposed is not a second sentence, but the first sentence imposed in the case. There is no second sentence raising a double jeopardy issue and no absence of authority in the trial court to impose the statutory sentence.State v. Wood, 1974-NMCA-113, 86 N.M. 731, 527 P.2d 494, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 730, 527 P.2d 493.\n\nNo abuse of discretion.— Trial court did not abuse its discretion by not adopting report of the psychiatrist or in not requesting diagnosis and recommendation from the department of corrections (now corrections department) as pertaining to defendant who pleaded guilty to count of contributing to delinquency of a minor.State v. Hogan, 1972-NMCA-037, 83 N.M. 608, 495 P.2d 388.\n\nSentence not unjust or improper.— Where the sentence in this case was in accordance with law, an appellate court cannot say it was unjust or improper in the circumstances because recommendations for a more lenient sentence were not followed or by imposing the statutory sentence on a 17-year-old first offender.State v. Madrigal, 1973-NMCA-116, 85 N.M. 496, 513 P.2d 1278, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 483, 513 P.2d 1265.\n\nDifference between suspension and deferralis that suspension involves a sentence imposed while deferral does not. With suspension, the sentence having been imposed, the court cannot later alter the sentence upwards. With deferral, no sentence having been imposed, the court may give any sentence it could originally have given.State v. Kenneman, 1982-NMCA-145, 98 N.M. 794, 653 P.2d 170, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 47, 653 P.2d 878.\n\nInvalid grounds of sentence deferral.— A trial court may not defer sentencing after a conviction on condition that the defendant serve a certain period of time in a county jail and abide by terms of a probation agreement.State v. Lopez, 1982-NMCA-163, 99 N.M. 791, 664 P.2d 989.\n\nConstitutional to impose three-year sentence when sentencing originally deferred for two years.— The imposition of a three-year sentence when sentencing was originally deferred for two years does not violate the prohibition on double jeopardy, when the first sentence imposed is when the defendant's probation is revoked.State v. Kenneman, 1982-NMCA-145, 98 N.M. 794, 653 P.2d 170, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 47, 653 P.2d 878.\n\nSuspension order must include any restrictions.— Restrictions to be imposed upon conduct of person under suspended sentence were to be specified in order of suspension.Ex parte Selig, 1924-NMSC-020, 29 N.M. 430, 223 P. 97;Ex parte Hamm, 1918-NMSC-058, 24 N.M. 33, 172 P. 190, 1918D L.R.A. 694.\n\nEffect where good behavior required.— The words \"good behavior,\" as used in order suspending sentence during good behavior, meant conduct conformable to law, and required no higher standard of conduct than the law demanded.Ex parte Hamm, 1918-NMSC-058, 24 N.M. 33, 172 P. 190, 1918D L.R.A. 694.\n\nJurisdiction after seven years.— Where defendant entered plea of nolo contendere to charge of contributing to delinquency of a minor and sentence was deferred until further order of court, lapse of almost seven years time did not deprive court of jurisdiction to impose sentence.State v. Sorrows, 1957-NMSC-091, 63 N.M. 277, 317 P.2d 324.\n\nReasonable investigation contemplated.— The statutes permitting the court to suspend or defer a sentence contemplate that reasonable investigation be made by the court in cases where probation is indicated, but no procedure is prescribed for such investigation, nor does the statute specify the character or quantum of evidence necessary to warrant the suspension or deferral of sentence.State v. Serrano, 1966-NMSC-166, 76 N.M. 655, 417 P.2d 795.\n\nEffect of refusal to hear testimony.— The refusal of the trial court to hear the offered testimony upon application for suspension, or deferral of sentence, does not justify reversal since the statute makes no requirement that the contemplated investigation shall include a trial, or hearing, nor does the statute by implication, or otherwise, grant the defendant the right to introduce testimony in support of his request.State v. Serrano, 1966-NMSC-166, 76 N.M. 655, 417 P.2d 795.\n\nPresumption where no reason for denial given.— Where defendant's counsel asked the court to place defendant on probation before sentence was imposed, and no reasons were given by the court for denying probation, it is presumed the court considered the question of probation before sentencing defendant to the penitentiary.State v. Follis, 1970-NMCA-083, 81 N.M. 690, 472 P.2d 655.\n\nCredits allowed on unsuspended portion of sentence.— Good time credits shall be allowed to be deducted from the maximum unsuspended portion of a sentence for purposes of determining entitlement of right to release from imprisonment where other provisions of the law do not circumscribe the minimum imprisonment to be served.Coutts v. Cox, 1966-NMSC-027, 75 N.M. 761, 411 P.2d 347.\n\nAdditional sentences for firearm use and habitual offender status cannot be served concurrently.State v. Mayberry, 1982-NMCA-061, 97 N.M. 760, 643 P.2d 629.\n\nPartial suspension with probation authorized.— A sentencing judge has the authority to suspend a sentence in part and then order probation for all or some of the portion which is suspended.State v. Sinyard, 1983-NMCA-150, 100 N.M. 694, 675 P.2d 426, cert. denied, 100 N.M. 689, 675 P.2d 421.\n\nCourt authorized to suspend or defer sentence for second heroin trafficking conviction.— A life sentence is not mandatory for a second conviction of trafficking in heroin and the court has the authority to suspend or defer the sentence imposed.State v. Sanchez, 1982-NMSC-032, 97 N.M. 521, 641 P.2d 1068.\n\nOrder committing defendant to state hospital for indeterminate period not valid sentence.— An order directing that the defendant be transported to the state hospital for an indeterminate period and then be returned to the district court for sentencing is not a valid sentence permitted by law, nor does it constitute a final judgment and sentence for purposes of an appeal.State v. Garcia, 1983-NMCA-017, 99 N.M. 466, 659 P.2d 918.\n\nThe legislature has imposed a 60-day maximum limitation on diagnostic commitments,and the court is without authority to impose a second diagnostic commitment or an indefinite commitment in the same cause.State v. Garcia, 1983-NMCA-017, 99 N.M. 466, 659 P.2d 918.\n\nDiagnostic commitment not required prior to imposing sentence.— The court is not required to order a diagnostic commitment prior to imposing sentence.State v. Watchman, 1991-NMCA-010, 111 N.M. 727, 809 P.2d 641, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 529, 807 P.2d 227,overruled in part on other grounds byState v. Hosteen, 1996-NMCA-084, 122 N.M. 228, 923 P.2d 595.\n\nDiagnostic evaluation not merited.— Where the state argued that a 60-day evaluation was not necessary because the trial court had before it evidence of nine years of psychological evaluations, as well as the testimony of two mental health experts, it was within the court's discretion, based on the information before it, to conclude that a diagnostic evaluation was not merited.State v. Mireles, 2004-NMCA-100, 136 N.M. 337, 98 P.3d 727, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-008, 136 N.M. 492, 100 P.3d 197.\n\nSuspended sentence void.— A court which is not encompassed in this statute does not have the authority to suspend a sentence and any suspension of a sentence by those courts is void. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6163.\n\nIndefinite deferral not allowed.— In the case of a defendant in a felony case who is convicted or pleads guilty, a district judge may not enter an order stating that the judgment and sentence of the court is \"deferred indefinitely.\" 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-31.\n\nRequirement to leave jurisdiction void.— A suspended sentence, whether valid or invalid as to the right of the court to suspend, is absolutely a void sentence when imposed with the condition that the defendant leave and remain away from the jurisdiction. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6163.\n\nSentencing where released person apprehended.— If the suspension of the sentence is void and the person after sentence is released, the sentence may then be imposed at any time the person is apprehended. The defendant falls into the category of an escaped convict at the time he is released after a void sentence suspension. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6163.\n\nPayment of transportation costs for diagnostic evaluation.— The state is required to pay transportation costs for prisoners committed for diagnostic evaluation under this section. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-20.\n\nMagistrate court may order restitution.— The magistrate court may, as part of its sentencing power, order a Criminal Code or Motor Vehicle Code violator to make restitution. 1979 Op.

      "text": "A. When a person has been convicted of a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment is authorized and when the magistrate, metropolitan or district court has deferred or suspended sentence, it shall order the defendant to be placed on probation for all or some portion of the period of deferment or suspension if the defendant is in need of supervision, guidance or direction that is feasible for the corrections department to furnish. Except for sex offenders as provided in Section 31-20-5.2 NMSA 1978, the total period of probation for district court shall not exceed five years and the total period of probation for the magistrate or metropolitan courts shall be no longer than the maximum allowable incarceration time for the offense or as otherwise provided by law.\n\nB. If a defendant is required to serve a period of probation subsequent to a period of incarceration:\n\n(1) the period of probation shall be served subsequent to any required period of parole, with the time served on parole credited as time served on the period of probation and the conditions of probation imposed by the court deemed as additional conditions of parole; and\n\n(2) in the event that the defendant violates any condition of that parole, the parole board shall cause him to be brought before it pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-21-14 NMSA 1978 and may make any disposition authorized pursuant to that section and, if parole is revoked, the period of parole served in the custody of a correctional facility shall not be credited as time served on probation.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-29-17, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 29-17; and recompiled as 1953 Comp., § 40A-29-41, by Laws 1977, ch. 216, § 16; 1984, ch. 106, § 2; 1985, ch. 75, § 1; 2003 (1st S.S.), ch. 1, § 6.\n\nThe 2003 (1st S.S.) amendment,effective February 3, 2004, substituted \"corrections department to furnish. Except for sex offenders as provided in Section 31-20-5.2 NMSA 1978\" for \"field services division of the corrections department to furnish; provided, however\" near the middle of Subsection A.\n\nApplication to multiple sentences.— Where the defendant was serving two separate sentences for two separate convictions, the defendant's failure to successfully complete parole in one case tolled the time for bringing a probation revocation petition in the second case.State v. Neal, 2007-NMCA-086, 142 N.M. 487, 167 P.3d 935.\n\nLegislative intent.— Legislature clearly intended in this section to give the sentencing judge authority to withhold the imposition of probation upon suspending a sentence. Probation was not \"automatic\" where defendant's sentence was suspended and this is further buttressed by the permissive language of Section 31-20-6 NMSA 1978.State v. Soria, 1971-NMCA-042, 82 N.M. 509, 484 P.2d 351.\n\nProbation required.— This section provides that where a defendant receives a deferred or suspended sentence, the court must order probation.State v. Leslie, 2004-NMCA-106, 136 N.M. 244, 96 P.3d 805.\n\nDeferred or suspended sentence always entails mandatory probationwith conditions attached.State v. Leslie, 2004-NMCA-106, 136 N.M. 244, 96 P.3d 805.\n\nProbation is part of suspended or deferred sentence.State v. Baca, 2005-NMCA-001, 136 N.M. 667, 104 P.3d 533, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-012, 136 N.M. 665, 103 P.3d 1097.\n\nDifference between suspension and deferralis that suspension involves a sentence imposed while deferral does not. With suspension, the sentence having been imposed, the court cannot later alter the sentence upwards. With deferral, no sentence having been imposed, the court may give any sentence it could originally have given.State v. Kenneman, 1982-NMCA-145, 98 N.M. 794, 653 P.2d 170, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 47, 653 P.2d 878.\n\nFive-year probation limitation applies in aggregate.— Both the internal wording of this section and the legislative history suggest that the five-year limitation applies in the aggregate.State v. Devigne, 1981-NMCA-088, 96 N.M. 561, 632 P.2d 1199.\n\nThe total period of probation that may be imposed on a defendant for convictions that occurred at one trial is five years, even though the aggregate sum of the suspended sentences exceeds five years.State v. Devigne, 1981-NMCA-088, 96 N.M. 561, 632 P.2d 1199.\n\nSentence which required consecutive five-year terms of probation was illegal.— Where four different indictments were filed against petitioner charging him with sixteen crimes which occurred between June 1, 2010 and June 3, 2010, and where the district court granted the state's motion to consolidate the four cases for plea and disposition, and where, following petitioner's guilty plea to all sixteen of the original charges, the district court ordered that the sentences in each case be served consecutively, but suspended the sentences in each case and ordered consecutive five-year terms of probation, and where, following multiple probation violations and multiple revocations and reinstatements of probation, petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, asserting that he was illegally sentenced and did not receive proper credit calculations, the district court erred in denying the petition for writ of habeas corpus, because the structure of the judgment and sentence in this case required petitioner to serve more than ten years of probation in violation of NMSA 1978, 31-20-5(A), which limits a term of probation to five years. When two or more cases are consolidated for a plea and sentencing, if the district court in its discretion suspends all or part of the sentence, only a single term of probation, not to exceed five years, can be imposed.Torres v. Santistevan, 2023-NMSC-021.\n\nMaximum period of probation that court may impose as sentencing is a total of five years,regardless of the number of convictions, not that five years is the total amount of time a defendant can serve on probation, regardless of the number of violations.State v. Baca, 2005-NMCA-001, 136 N.M. 667, 104 P.3d 533, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-012, 136 N.M. 665, 103 P.3d 1097.\n\nEffect where no fixed period of probation specified.— When a defendant is placed on probation, without a fixed period being specified, then that period of probation is the maximum set by this section.State v. Baca, 1977-NMCA-030, 90 N.M. 280, 562 P.2d 841.\n\nProbation may not exceed maximum sentence.— Trial court erred in setting six-year probation period for defendant who pleaded guilty to two fourth-degree felony charges where sentences were to be served concurrently, since the maximum sentence for a fourth-degree felony was a penitentiary term of five years, and the period of probation could not exceed that of the maximum sentence prescribed by law for the commission of the crime for which he was convicted.State v. Crespin, 1977-NMCA-046, 90 N.M. 434, 564 P.2d 998.\n\nMaximum length of probation.— This section limits the maximum length of probation to the maximum imprisonment which could have been imposed.State v. Gonzales, 1981-NMCA-086, 96 N.M. 556, 632 P.2d 1194.\n\nMaximum period for misdemeanors.— The maximum period of probation that may be assessed in misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor cases is the maximum allowable period of incarceration for that crime, irrespective of whether a defendant is sentenced in district court or in a lower tribunal.State v. Candelaria, 1991-NMCA-107, 113 N.M. 288, 825 P.2d 221.\n\nPartial suspension with probation authorized.— A sentencing judge has the authority to suspend a sentence in part and then order probation for all or some of the portion which is suspended.State v. Sinyard, 1983-NMCA-150, 100 N.M. 694, 675 P.2d 426, cert. denied, 100 N.M. 689, 675 P.2d 421.\n\nCourt may suspend defendant's 18-month term, impose five-year probation.— The trial court's judgment in suspending part of defendant's term of incarceration and imposing a five-year term of supervised probation was upheld by this section, even though defendant had been convicted of a fourth-degree felony with a basic term of incarceration of 18 months.State v. Encinias, 1986-NMCA-049, 104 N.M. 740, 726 P.2d 1174, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 632, 725 P.2d 832.\n\nParole term not part of maximum sentence for determining probation.— The term of parole included in the original sentence is not to be utilized in determining the maximum length of probation under a suspended sentence.State v. Gonzales, 1981-NMCA-086, 96 N.M. 556, 632 P.2d 1194.\n\nWhen probation requirements ineffective.— Once a deferred sentence becomes void, the probation requirements are no longer in effect.State v. Aragon, 1979-NMCA-074, 93 N.M. 132, 597 P.2d 317.\n\nWhen probationary part of sentence void.— Where the court ordered a defendant placed on probation without deferring or suspending any of his sentences, this action is not within the bounds prescribed by law, and therefore, the probationary part of defendant's sentence is void.State v. Nolan, 1979-NMCA-116, 93 N.M. 472, 601 P.2d 442, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 683, 604 P.2d 821.\n\nParole time to be credited in all cases.— The legislature clearly intended that the parole time served prior to a period of probation would be credited in all cases; there is nothing in the statute indicating that it is to be applied only in those cases where the sentencing order is not specific in ordering that probation be served after the term of incarceration. Furthermore, the trial court may not ignore the mandate of the legislature in crafting a sentence.State v. Muniz, 1995-NMCA-024, 119 N.M. 634, 894 P.2d 411.\n\nThe trial court does not have the authority to order that a probation period be served consecutively to a parole period without the credit that is awarded by statute.State v. Muniz, 1995-NMCA-024, 119 N.M. 634, 894 P.2d 411.\n\nTime served on probation not credited as time served on parole.— Because the court sentenced defendant to jail and not to prison, parole was not authorized; and, although Subsection B allows the time served on parole to be credited as time served on probation, no provision exists allowing the time served on probation to be credited as time served on parole.State v. Brown, 1999-NMSC-004, 126 N.M. 642, 974 P.2d 136.\n\nWhen court may revoke suspension.— The court has the power to revoke the suspension of sentence and to thereupon invoke the same, upon proof being made of the violation of the conditions of probation.State v. Baca, 1969-NMCA-076, 80 N.M. 527, 458 P.2d 602.\n\nSubsequent criminal conviction not necessary.— A conviction of a subsequent criminal offense is not necessary to the revocation of suspension and the invocation of a prior suspended sentence.State v. Baca, 1969-NMCA-076, 80 N.M. 527, 458 P.2d 602.\n\nDegree of proof of violation.— The degree of proof required to support a finding of a violation of probation is met when the evidence establishes a violation of the conditions of probation with such reasonable certainty as to satisfy the conscience of the court of the truth of the violation. It does not have to be established beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Baca, 1969-NMCA-076, 80 N.M. 527, 458 P.2d 602.\n\nStatutory handling for probation violation.— Because the terms of probation are defined by the probation statutes, a probation violation must be handled as prescribed in 31-21-15 NMSA 1978.State v. Leslie, 2004-NMCA-106, 136 N.M. 244, 96 P.3d 805.\n\nViolation of probation must be established with reasonable certaintyso as to satisfy the conscience of the court as to the truth of the violation; however, a violation of probation need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Martinez, 1972-NMCA-135, 84 N.M. 295, 502 P.2d 320.\n\nNo power to defer until conviction.— The court has no power or authority to defer a sentence and impose obligations of probation upon a person charged with a crime, until that person is convicted of the crime.State v. Apodaca, 1969-NMCA-020, 80 N.M. 155, 452 P.2d 489.\n\nExpress adjudication of guilt not necessary.— An express adjudication of conviction, or finding of guilt, is not necessary if it is apparent from other matters in the record that the court made a judicial determination of conviction or guilt.State v. Apodaca, 1969-NMCA-020, 80 N.M. 155, 452 P.2d 489.\n\nEffect of nolo contendere plea.— Upon the acceptance of the plea of nolo contendere and entry of \"judgment and sentence,\" by which the court deferred sentence and imposed conditions of probation, there was a determination of guilt, or a pronouncement of judgment.State v. Apodaca, 1969-NMCA-020, 80 N.M. 155, 452 P.2d 489.\n\nSuspension or deferment not matter of right.— Suspension or deferment of a sentence is not a matter of right but is an act of clemency.State v. Baca, 1977-NMCA-030, 90 N.M. 280, 562 P.2d 841.\n\nNo amendment of judgment or sentence allowed.— Where district court, when it sentenced defendant to six months in county jail and suspended the balance of the sentence without probation, issued a valid original judgment and sentence, accordingly could not amend that judgment and sentence to add the conditions of probation, since a valid sentence may not be amended by increasing the penalty.State v. Soria, 1971-NMCA-042, 82 N.M. 509, 484 P.2d 351.\n\nEffect where probation conditions not in deferred sentence; amendment.— In determining whether there is a violation of probation, an appellate court must look to the trial court's order. If the deferred sentence does not set out the conditions of probation, there are no conditions to be violated and conditions may not be added by amendment subsequent to imposition of a valid original judgment.State v. Martinez, 1972-NMCA-135, 84 N.M. 295, 502 P.2d 320.\n\nConditions of probation should be made clear in judgment.State v. Martinez, 1972-NMCA-135, 84 N.M. 295, 502 P.2d 320.\n\nProbation violation necessary to revoke probation.— The trial court has authority to revoke defendant's probation and impose the penitentiary sentence; however, to do so, a violation of probation must be established.State v. Martinez, 1972-NMCA-135, 84 N.M. 295, 502 P.2d 320.\n\nIncarceration after violation not required.— Neither this section nor Section 31-21-15 NMSA 1978 require the trial court to impose incarceration if the defendant violates the conditions of his probation.State v. Mares, 1994-NMSC-123, 119 N.M. 48, 888 P.2d 930.\n\nReasonable investigation contemplated.— The statutes permitting the court to suspend or defer a sentence contemplate that reasonable investigation be made by the court in cases where probation is indicated, but no procedure is prescribed for such investigation, nor does the statute specify the character or quantum of evidence necessary to warrant the suspension or deferral of sentence.State v. Serrano, 1966-NMSC-166, 76 N.M. 655, 417 P.2d 795.\n\nProbation where no reason for denial given.— Where defendant's counsel asked the court to place defendant on probation before sentence was imposed, and no reasons were given by the court for denying probation, it is presumed the court considered the question of probation before sentencing defendant to the penitentiary.State v. Follis, 1970-NMCA-083, 81 N.M. 690, 472 P.2d 655.\n\nHabeas corpus action moot where petitioner on probation.— Because petitioner had begun serving his mandatory period of probation under this section, his incarceration was complete; therefore, his habeas corpus action, alleging that amended regulations affecting his good time credits were impermissible, ex post facto laws, was moot, since such credits cannot be applied to a probationary term.Aragon v. Shanks, 144 F.3d 690 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1005, 119 S. Ct. 518, 142 L.

      "text": "A. When a district court defers imposition of a sentence for a sex offender, or suspends all or any portion of a sentence for a sex offender, the district court shall include a provision in the judgment and sentence that specifically requires the sex offender to serve an indeterminate period of supervised probation for a period of not less than five years and not in excess of twenty years. A sex offender's period of supervised probation may be for a period of less than twenty years if, at a review hearing provided for in Subsection B of this section, the state is unable to prove that the sex offender should remain on probation. Prior to placing a sex offender on probation, the district court shall conduct a hearing to determine the terms and conditions of supervised probation for the sex offender. The district court may consider any relevant factors, including:\n\n(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense for which the sex offender was convicted or adjudicated;\n\n(2) the nature and circumstances of a prior sex offense committed by the sex offender;\n\n(3) rehabilitation efforts engaged in by the sex offender, including participation in treatment programs while incarcerated or elsewhere;\n\n(4) the danger to the community posed by the sex offender; and\n\n(5) a risk and needs assessment regarding the sex offender, developed by the sex offender management board of the New Mexico sentencing commission or another appropriate entity, to be used by appropriate district court personnel.\n\nB.

When a sex offender has served the initial five years of supervised probation, the district court shall also review the duration of the sex offender's supervised probation at two and one-half year intervals. When a sex offender has served the initial five years of supervised probation, at each review hearing the state shall bear the burden of proving to a reasonable certainty that the sex offender should remain on probation.\n\nC. The district court may order a sex offender placed on probation to abide by reasonable terms and conditions of probation, including:\n\n(1) being subject to intensive supervision by a probation officer of the corrections department;\n\n(2) participating in an outpatient or inpatient sex offender treatment program;\n\n(3) a probationary agreement by the sex offender not to use alcohol or drugs;\n\n(4) a probationary agreement by the sex offender not to have contact with certain persons or classes of persons; and\n\n(5) being subject to alcohol testing, drug testing or polygraph examinations used to determine if the sex offender is in compliance with the terms and conditions of his probation.\n\nD. The district court shall notify the sex offender's counsel of record of an upcoming probation hearing for a sex offender, and the sex offender's counsel of record shall represent the sex offender at the probation hearing. When a sex offender's counsel of record provides the court with good cause that the counsel of record should not represent the sex offender at the probation hearing and the sex offender is subsequently unable to obtain counsel, the district court shall notify the chief public defender of the upcoming probation hearing and the chief public defender shall make representation available to the sex offender at that hearing.\n\nE. If the district court finds that a sex offender has violated the terms and conditions of his probation, the district court may revoke his probation or may order additional terms and conditions of probation.\n\nF. As used in this section, \"sex offender\" means a person who is convicted of, pleads guilty to or pleads nolo contendere to any one of the following offenses:\n\n(1) kidnapping, as provided in Section 30-4-1 NMSA 1978, when committed with intent to inflict a sexual offense upon the victim;\n\n(2) criminal sexual penetration in the first, second or third degree, as provided in Section 30-9-11 NMSA 1978;\n\n(3) criminal sexual contact of a minor in the second or third degree, as provided in Section 30-9-13 NMSA 1978;\n\n(4) sexual exploitation of children in the second degree, as provided in Section 30-6A-3 NMSA 1978; or\n\n(5) sexual exploitation of children by prostitution in the first or second degree, as provided in Section 30-6A-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:Laws 2003 (1st S.S.), ch. 1, § 7.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2003 (1st S.S.), ch. 1 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 23, was effective February 3, 2004, 90 days after adjournment of the legislature.\n\nThis section is not unconstitutionally vague.— A reasonable construction is possible based on the plain language of NMSA 1978, § 31-20-5.2, and thus the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. A sex offender whose sentence is deferred or suspended is required to serve an indeterminate period of supervised probation for a period of not less than five years and not in excess of twenty years; a probationer's term can only be less than twenty years if the state fails to meet its burden at a review hearing that the sex offender should remain on probation. Until such a review hearing is held, so long as the term has not lasted twenty years, the statute allows an individual of ordinary intelligence to determine that the probationer is still on probation.State v. Cooley, 2023-NMCA-089.\n\nDuration review hearings are mandatory.— Duration review hearings are mandatory; the goals of closely monitoring a sex offender's probation, including a review of the duration of a sex offender's probation, and ensuring that the state meets its burden of establishing that the probationer should remain on probation would be frustrated if the timeline for the hearings was not mandatory.State v. Cooley, 2023-NMCA-089.\n\nThe failure to conduct timely duration review hearings does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction over a probationer.— The legislature expressly conferred jurisdiction to the district court for an indeterminate period of five to twenty years; the period may be for fewer than twenty years, but only if the state fails to meet its burden at a duration review hearing. This indicates that, even if a deadline is missed, the district court must still hold a hearing and hold the state to its burden before a probationer's term may end early. Accordingly, failure to hold a timely duration review hearing does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction to later continue a defendant on probation.State v. Cooley, 2023-NMCA-089.\n\nDue process requires a duration review hearing within a reasonable time.— A probationer's right to due process requires a duration review hearing within a reasonable time, and a balancing of individual and governmental interests demonstrates how a late duration review hearing could still protect that right; in recognizing and evaluating the delay, cause of the delay, and missed opportunity, the district courts can adequately mitigate the risk posed by a late duration review hearing to ensure that a probationer receives due process, even if its ultimate conclusion is that probation must continue.State v. Cooley, 2023-NMCA-089.\n\nDefendants were not afforded procedural due process in untimely duration review hearing.— In consolidated cases where both defendants were convicted of criminal sexual penetration, both had a portion of their sentences suspended, and both were placed on supervised probation for an indeterminate period of five and twenty years, and where, in both cases, the state failed to conduct timely duration review hearings, the late duration review hearings deprived defendants of their rights to procedural due process, because the defendants had a significant liberty interest in release from probation unless the state met its burden of proving at a duration review hearing, to a reasonable certainty, that their probation should continue, and the late duration review hearing they both were given increased the likelihood that the interest was erroneously deprived by taking into consideration evidence that would have been unavailable at a timely hearing and failing to account for the delay in providing the late hearing and its cause.State v. Cooley, 2023-NMCA-089.\n\nSubsection B of this section is not void for vagueness.— In resolving whether a probationer should remain on probation for additional time under 31-20-5.2(B) NMSA 1978, \"reasonable certainty\" means evidence that a reasonable and impartial mind would be inclined to conclude justifies that the sex offender should remain on probation, and in deciding whether a sex offender should remain on probation under Subsection B, the district court may remain guided by the relevant factors set forth in 31-20-5.2(A) NMSA 1978. Subsection B is not so vague that it allows, if not encourages, subjective and ad hoc application.State v. Chavez, 2019-NMCA-068, cert. denied.\n\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering defendant to remain on probation.— Where defendant was serving a mandatory five-year probationary term for convictions of two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and where the state filed a motion under 31-20-5.2(B) NMSA 1978 requesting that defendant remain on probation for an additional two and one-half years, the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering defendant to remain on probation for the additional period with the same terms and conditions based on a finding of two violations of the terms and conditions of defendant's probation.State v. Chavez, 2019-NMCA-068, cert. denied.\n\nThe district court erred by sentencing defendant to sex offender parole and probation.— Where defendant was convicted of attempt to commit second-degree criminal sexual contact of a minor (CSCM), the district court erred when it imposed a sentence to sex offender probation and parole instead of a sentence in accordance with the general probation and parole statutes, because while CSCM is among the enumerated offenses triggering a sentence to sex offender probation or parole, attempt to commit CSCM is not included among the offenses.State v. Notah, 2022-NMCA-005, cert. denied.",

      "text": "The magistrate, metropolitan or district court shall attach to its order deferring or suspending sentence reasonable conditions as it may deem necessary to ensure that the defendant will observe the laws of the United States and the various states and the ordinances of any municipality. The defendant upon conviction shall be required to reimburse a law enforcement agency or local crime stopper program for the amount of any reward paid by the agency or program for information leading to the defendant's arrest, prosecution or conviction, but in no event shall reimbursement to the crime stopper program preempt restitution to victims pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-17-1 NMSA l978. The defendant upon conviction shall be required to pay the actual costs of the defendant's supervised probation service to the adult probation and parole division of the corrections department or appropriate responsible agency for deposit to the corrections department intensive supervision fund not exceeding one thousand eight hundred dollars ($1,800) annually to be paid in monthly installments of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) and not more than one hundred fifty dollars ($150), as set by the appropriate district supervisor of the adult probation and parole division, based upon the financial circumstances of the defendant. The defendant's payment of the supervised probation costs shall not be waived unless the court holds an evidentiary hearing and finds that the defendant is unable to pay the costs. If the court waives the defendant's payment of the supervised probation costs and the defendant's financial circumstances subsequently change so that the defendant is able to pay the costs, the appropriate district supervisor of the adult probation and parole division shall advise the court and the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the waiver should be rescinded. The court may also require the defendant to:\n\nA. provide for the support of persons for whose support the defendant is legally responsible;\n\nB. undergo available medical or psychiatric treatment and enter and remain in a specified institution when required for that purpose;\n\nC. be placed on probation under the supervision, guidance or direction of the adult probation and parole division for a term not to exceed five years;\n\nD. serve a period of time in volunteer labor to be known as \"community service\". The type of labor and period of service shall be at the sole discretion of the court; provided that a person receiving community service shall be immune from any civil liability other than gross negligence arising out of the community service, and a person who performs community service pursuant to court order or a criminal diversion program shall not be entitled to wages, shall not be considered an employee and shall not be entitled to workers' compensation, unemployment benefits or any other benefits otherwise provided by law. As used in this subsection, \"community service\" means labor that benefits the public at large or a public, charitable or educational entity or institution;\n\nE. make a contribution of not less than ten dollars ($10.00) and not more than one hundred dollars ($100), to be paid in monthly installments of not less than five dollars ($5.00), to a local crime stopper program, a local domestic violence prevention or treatment program or a local drug abuse resistance education program that operates in the territorial jurisdiction of the court; and\n\nF. satisfy any other conditions reasonably related to the defendant's rehabilitation.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-29-18, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 29-18; and recompiled as 1953 Comp., § 40A-29-42, by Laws 1977, ch. 216, § 16; 1977, ch. 217, § 1; 1981, ch. 285, § 2; 1983, ch. 159, § 1; 1984, ch. 106, § 3; 1985, ch. 23, § 15; 1985, ch. 75, § 2; 1987, ch. 139, § 2; 1988, ch. 62, § 1; 1997, ch. 215, § 1; 2004, ch. 38, § 1; 2007, ch. 101, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For Crime Victims Reparation Act,see31-22-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, added local domestic violence prevention or treatment programs to the list of optional contributions the court may require a defendant to make as a condition of a deferred or suspended sentence.\n\nThe 2004 amendment,effective July 1, 2004, amended the first paragraph to change one thousand twenty dollars ($1,020) to one thousand eight hundred dollars ($1,800), fifteen dollars ($15.00) to twenty-five dollars ($25.00), eighty-five dollars ($85.00) to one hundred fifty dollars ($150), delete \"or the local supervisor of the responsible agency on the basis of changed financial circumstances, as may be required\" and insert in its place: \"based upon the financial circumstances of the defendant. The defendant's payment of the supervised probation costs shall not be waived unless the court holds an evidentiary hearing and finds that the defendant is unable to pay the costs. If the court waives the defendant's payment of the supervised probation costs and the defendant's financial circumstances subsequently change so that the defendant is able to pay the costs, the appropriate district supervisor of the adult probation and parole division shall advise the court and the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the waiver should be rescinded. The court may also require the defendant to:\" and amended Subsection E to delete \"If there is no program in that area, the contribution shall be made to the crime stoppers commission\".\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective June 20, 1997, substituted \"adult probation and parole division\" for \"field services division\" twice in the third sentence of the introductory paragraph and in Subsection C, and substituted \"crime stopper program or a local drug abuse resistance education program that operates in the territorial jurisdiction of the court\" for \"crime stopper program that operates in the territorial jurisdiction of the court and is approved by the crime stoppers commission\" at the end of the first sentence in Subsection E.\n\nLegislative intent.— Legislature clearly intended in Section 31-20-5 NMSA 1978 to give the sentencing judge authority to withhold the imposition of probation upon suspending a sentence. Probation was not \"automatic\" where defendant's sentence was suspended and this is further buttressed by the permissive language of this section.State v. Soria, 1971-NMCA-042, 82 N.M. 509, 484 P.2d 351.\n\nIt is solely within province of legislature to establish penalties for criminal behavior.State v. Lack, 1982-NMCA-111, 98 N.M. 500, 650 P.2d 22, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 478, 649 P.2d 1391.\n\nDifference between suspension and deferralis that suspension involves a sentence imposed while deferral does not. With suspension, the sentence having been imposed, the court cannot later alter the sentence upwards. With deferral, no sentence having been imposed, the court may give any sentence it could originally have given.State v. Kenneman, 1982-NMCA-145, 98 N.M. 794, 653 P.2d 170, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 47, 653 P.2d 878.\n\nGeneral purposes of probationare education and rehabilitation, without the requirement of serving the suspended period of incarceration. Probation is not meant to be painless.State v. Donaldson, 1983-NMCA-064, 100 N.M. 111, 666 P.2d 1258, cert. denied, 100 N.M. 53, 665 P.2d 809.\n\nPolicy for probation.— In placing a criminal under strict conditions of probation and under probation supervision, the policy of the State of New Mexico and the obligation of the courts of New Mexico are to place guarded trust in the probationer to consciously conduct himself in a manner to prove he can remain free from criminal activity.State v. Baca, 2004-NMCA-049, 135 N.M. 490, 90 P.3d 509.\n\nSupervised probation authorized.— A New Mexico district court has statutory authority to place a convicted defendant on supervised probation.State v. Baca, 2004-NMCA-049, 135 N.M. 490, 90 P.3d 509.\n\nDeferred or suspended sentence always entails mandatory probationwith conditions attached.State v. Leslie, 2004-NMCA-106, 136 N.M. 244, 96 P.3d 805.\n\nSection 31-20-13 A NMSA 1978 expressly incorporates probation statutesthat apply to a person serving a deferred sentence.State v. Leslie, 2004-NMCA-106, 136 N.M. 244, 96 P.3d 805.\n\nStandards for assessing conditions of probation.— The trial court, at the time of sentencing, is allowed to consider a wide range of options to assure defendant's rehabilitation, and the conditions of probation will not be set aside unless they: (1) have no reasonable relation to the offense for which the defendant was convicted; (2) relate to activity which is not itself criminal in nature; and (3) require or forbid conduct which is not reasonably related to deterring future criminality.State v. Taylor, 1986-NMCA-011, 104 N.M. 88, 717 P.2d 64, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 237, 719 P.2d 815.\n\nRequiring the defendant to execute promissory notesto the victims of his fraud and embezzlement was reasonably related to his rehabilitation and was a proper condition of his probation.State v. Jensen, 1998-NMCA-034, 124 N.M. 726, 955 P.2d 195.\n\nGuidelines for review of imposition of probation.— A trial court has broad discretion in imposing probation upon a convicted defendant, and the court's discretion will not be set aside on review unless the terms and conditions of probation: (1) have no reasonable relationship to the offense for which defendant was convicted; (2) relate to activity which is not itself criminal in nature; and (3) require or forbid conduct which is not reasonably related to deterring future criminality.State v. Donaldson, 1983-NMCA-064, 100 N.M. 111, 666 P.2d 1258, cert. denied, 100 N.M. 53, 665 P.2d 809.\n\nProbation is a discretionary act of the sentencing court.— New Mexico law places squarely within the purview of the district court the authority to order a defendant to satisfy any other conditions reasonably related to rehabilitation, and such order is reviewed on appeal only for an abuse of discretion.State v. Green, 2015-NMCA-007, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-012.\n\nAbuse of discretion.— Under the abuse of discretion standard of appellate review, conditions of probation will not be set aside unless they have no reasonable relationship to the offense for which the defendant was convicted, relate to activity which is not itself criminal in nature, and require or forbid conduct which is not reasonably related to deferring future criminality.State v. Green, 2015-NMCA-007, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-012.\n\nDistrict court order may incorporate conditions of probation.— Where a district court's order generally states that a defendant must comply with reasonable conditions specified by the probation authorities, such language is sufficient to incorporate specific terms and conditions of probation set by the probation office.State v. Green, 2015-NMCA-007, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-012.\n\nSex offender behavior contract as a condition of probation.— Where defendant was convicted of kidnapping, an element of which is that the victim be held for service against the victim's will, and where that holding for service can include holding a victim for sexual purposes, and where defendant's conviction involved criminal sexual contact with the victim, the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the requirement that defendant comply with a sex offender behavior contract was reasonably related to defendant's current conviction.State v. Green, 2015-NMCA-007, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-012.\n\nMaximum period of probation for misdemeanors.— The maximum period of probation that may be assessed in misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor cases is the maximum allowable period of incarceration for that crime, irrespective of whether a defendant is sentenced in district court or in a lower tribunal.State v. Candelaria, 1991-NMCA-107, 113 N.M. 288, 825 P.2d 221.\n\nNo power to defer until conviction.— The court has no power or authority to defer a sentence and impose obligations of probation upon a person charged with a crime, until that person is convicted of the crime.State v. Apodaca, 1969-NMCA-020, 80 N.M. 155, 452 P.2d 489.\n\nExpress adjudication not necessary.— An express adjudication of conviction, or finding of guilt, is not necessary if it is apparent from other matters in the record that the court made a judicial determination of conviction or guilt.State v. Apodaca, 1969-NMCA-020, 80 N.M. 155, 452 P.2d 489.\n\nCourt may suspend defendant's 18-month term, impose five-year probation.— The trial court's judgment in suspending part of defendant's term of incarceration and imposing a five-year term of supervised probation was upheld by this section, even though defendant had been convicted of a fourth-degree felony with a basic term of incarceration of 18 months.State v. Encinias, 1986-NMCA-049, 104 N.M. 740, 726 P.2d 1174, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 632, 725 P.2d 832.\n\nTrial court may impose conditions of probation authorized by law;conditions of probation unauthorized by law are void.State v. Ayala, 1981-NMCA-008, 95 N.M. 464, 623 P.2d 584.\n\nProvision for costs controls over 31-12-6 NMSA 1978.— The legislature having made a specific provision for costs as a condition of probation in Subsection A that specific provision controls over the general provision of 31-12-6 NMSA 1978.State v. Ayala, 1981-NMCA-008, 95 N.M. 464, 623 P.2d 584.\n\nAssessment of costs against defendant upon deferred sentence permitted.— The authorization in 31-12-6 NMSA 1978 that cost may be adjudged against the defendant, based on a conviction, permits assessment of costs against a defendant whose sentence is deferred.State v. Ayala, 1981-NMCA-008, 95 N.M. 464, 623 P.2d 584.\n\nDefendant cannot challenge amount or method of paying costs when objections initially waived.— Having requested the court's exercise of discretion, and having waived all objections to an assessment of costs in lieu of a fine, the defendant may not later challenge either the amount or method of payment ordered.State v. Padilla, 1982-NMCA-100, 98 N.M. 349, 648 P.2d 807, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794.\n\nThis section does not authorize jury and bailiff costsin prosecuting a defendant as a condition of probation.State v. Ayala, 1981-NMCA-008, 95 N.M. 464, 623 P.2d 584.\n\nJury and bailiff costs are part of expense of maintaining system of courtsand the administration of justice and may not be assessed against a defendant if they were assessed independently of any condition of probation.State v. Ayala, 1981-NMCA-008, 95 N.M. 464, 623 P.2d 584.\n\nRequired contribution to sheriff's department unauthorized.— A probation condition requiring the defendant to contribute $500 to a county sheriff's department was unauthorized and therefore void. On remand, the trial court had to reconsider imposition of a fine not to exceed $500.State v. Dominguez, 1993-NMCA-042, 115 N.M. 445, 853 P.2d 147, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 409, 852 P.2d 682.\n\nRestitution, ordered as a condition of probation, must be reasonably related to a proper rehabilitative purpose.— Where defendant was ordered as part of her sentence, following a guilty plea to the offense of forgery, to pay restitution for the costs of her extradition from New York, the restitution order could not have been authorized by the district court pursuant to this section because the order to pay extradition costs was not reasonably related to a proper rehabilitative purpose.State v. George, 2020-NMCA-039.\n\nWarrantless search condition is fairly and reasonably placed in probation orderto facilitate the probation officer's important supervisory and protective duties to help assure that the probationer assumes his responsibility a responsibility both to the probationer himself and to society to stay on a path of rehabilitation.State v. Baca, 2004-NMCA-049, 135 N.M. 490, 90 P.3d 509.\n\nWarrantless probation searches cannot be without a proper showingof an adequate degree of likelihood of criminal activity.State v. Baca, 2004-NMCA-049, 135 N.M. 490, 90 P.3d 509.\n\nAnd such searches can and must be supported by reasonable suspicionas defined in New Mexico law to be an awareness of specific articulable facts, judged objectively, that would lead a reasonable person to believe criminal activity occurred or was occurring.State v. Baca, 2004-NMCA-049, 135 N.M. 490, 90 P.3d 509.\n\nExigent circumstances are not required in connection with warrantless probation searchsupported by reasonable suspicion.State v. Baca, 2004-NMCA-049, 135 N.M. 490, 90 P.3d 509.\n\nFor rehabilitation and community safety purposes, probation officers have the right to conduct warrantless searches without the added requirement of exigent circumstances.State v. Baca, 2004-NMCA-049, 135 N.M. 490, 90 P.3d 509.\n\nCondition of probation requiring prior narcotics offender to submit to searchis reasonably related the probationer's prior criminal conduct and is aimed at deterring or discovering subsequent criminal offenses.State v. Gardner, 1980-NMCA-122, 95 N.M. 171, 619 P.2d 847.\n\nStatutory handling for probation violation.— Because the terms of probation are defined by the probation statutes, a probation violation must be handled as prescribed in Section 31-21-15 NMSA 1978.State v. Leslie, 2004-NMCA-106, 136 N.M. 244, 96 P.3d 805.\n\nWhen jurisdiction to vacate and revoke suspension exists.— The power of a district court to vacate and revoke an order of suspension exists only when some one or more of such terms or conditions specified in the order of suspension have been breached.State v. Baros, 1968-NMSC-001, 78 N.M. 623, 435 P.2d 1005.\n\nProof of violation needed.— The court has the power to revoke the suspension of sentence and to thereupon invoke the same, upon proof being made of the violation of the conditions of probation.State v. Baca, 1969-NMCA-076, 80 N.M. 527, 458 P.2d 602.\n\nSubsequent criminal conviction not necessary.— A conviction of a subsequent criminal offense is not necessary to the revocation of suspension and the invocation of a prior suspended sentence.State v. Baca, 1969-NMCA-076, 80 N.M. 527, 458 P.2d 602.\n\nDegree of proof.— The degree of proof required to support a finding of a violation of probation is met when the evidence establishes a violation of the conditions of probation with such reasonable certainty as to satisfy the conscience of the court of the truth of the violation. It does not have to be established beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Baca, 1969-NMCA-076, 80 N.M. 527, 458 P.2d 602.\n\nViolation of probation must be established with reasonable certaintyso as to satisfy the conscience of the court as to the truth of the violation; however, a violation of probation need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Martinez, 1972-NMCA-135, 84 N.M. 295, 502 P.2d 320.\n\nSufficiency of terms.— Where the trial judge imposed as a condition of probation that defendant report to the probation office as directed by the probation office and ordered that the conditions and terms of probation are made conditions and terms of the deferred sentence, the fact that the times when defendant was to report to the probation office, and that the terms of the probation office were not spelled out in the deferred sentence, did not show that such times and terms were not conditions of probation imposed by the trial court and the conditions of probation were sufficiently stated.State v. Martinez, 1972-NMCA-135, 84 N.M. 295, 502 P.2d 320.\n\nWhere no amendment of judgment or sentence allowed.— Where district court, when it sentenced defendant to six months in county jail and suspended the balance of the sentence without probation, issued a valid original judgment and sentence, accordingly could not amend that judgment and sentence to add the conditions of probation, since a valid sentence may not be amended by increasing the penalty.State v. Soria, 1971-NMCA-042, 82 N.M. 509, 484 P.2d 351.\n\nCommunity service may be condition of probation for gambling.— No one would dispute that criminal activity is anti-social by nature; ergo, community service as a condition of probation is not unrelated to the offense of gambling.State v. Padilla, 1982-NMCA-100, 98 N.M. 349, 648 P.2d 807, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794.\n\nJury trial limited to identity question.— In proceedings to revoke a suspended sentence, the right to a jury trial is limited to the question of identity.State v. Raines, 1967-NMCA-026, 78 N.M. 579, 434 P.2d 698.\n\nApplication of increased probation costs limited.— Increased probation costs, i.e., any amount in excess of $200 annually, can only constitutionally be applied to offenses which occur on or after June 19, 1981, at least to the extent the 1981 amendment to this section is relied upon as authority for the increased probation costs. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-15.\n\nIncreased probation terms limited.— The increased probation term of five years authorized by the 1981 amendment, i.e., any term in excess of four years for a third degree felony or any term in excess of two years for a fourth degree felony, can only constitutionally be applied to a third or fourth degree felony which occurs on or after June 19, 1981. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-15.\n\nParole costs limited.— Parole costs authorized by Section 31-21-10 NMSA 1978 can only constitutionally be applied to prisoners who are placed on parole for crimes committed on or after June 19, 1981, at least to the extent the 1981 amendment to this section is relied on as authority for parole costs. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-15.\n\nLimit on charitable contributions required of defendant.— Absent a clear legislative determination to the contrary, state judges do not have the power to require a defendant to pay money to a charitable organization unaggrieved by the defendant's offense. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-09.\n\n\"Drug abuse resistance education program\" refers to programs affiliated with the D.A.R.E. organization.— If a metropolitan, magistrate or district court chooses to defer or suspend a criminal sentence, New Mexico law requires that the court impose certain conditions to ensure that the defendant will observe the laws of the United States and the various states and the ordinances of any municipality, and among these conditions, the court may require a defendant to make a monetary contribution to one of three listed programs, a local crime stopper program, a local domestic violence prevention or treatment program or a local drug abuse resistance education program. The most common use of \"drug abuse resistance education\" generally is in relation to an organization which uses the program acronym D.A.R.E. (drug abuse resistance education), which is a nationally known 501(c)(3) organization that brings local law enforcement into schools to aid in educating students about drug use and its dangers, and the legislative history of 31-20-6(E) NMSA 1978, supports the position that \"a local drug abuse resistance education program\" should be interpreted narrowly, and that it is only to be applied to programs under the D.A.R.E. organization and not to other alternative sentencing programs that may provide services unrelated to drug education.Pecos Valley Teen Court being considered a \"local drug abuse resistance education program\" under NMSA 1978, Section 31-20-6(E)(1/25/21), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2021-01.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Definitive Sentencing in New Mexico: The 1977 Criminal Sentencing Act,\" see 9 N.M.L.

He shall thereupon be entitled to a certificate from the court so reciting such facts, and upon presenting the same to the governor, the defendant may, in the discretion of the governor, be granted a pardon or a certificate restoring such person to full rights of citizenship.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-29-21, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 303, § 29-21; and recompiled as 1953 Comp., § 40A-29-44, by Laws 1977, ch. 216, § 16.\n\nLack of jurisdiction to deny credit for time served on probation.— Where defendant, who was convicted of DWI, violated probation and the district court did not revoke defendant's probation before the probationary period expired, the court lost jurisdiction under Section 31-20-8 NMSA 1978 to deny defendant credit for time served on probation as provided in Subsection S of Section 66-8-102 NMSA 1978.State v. Ordunez, 2010-NMCA-095, 148 N.M. 620, 241 P.3d 621, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-010, 49 N.M. 64, 243 P.3d 1146,aff'd by2012-NMSC-024.\n\nOrder of unsatisfactory completion not authorized.— A trial court is without jurisdiction to enter an order of unsatisfactory completion after the probation period ends.State v. Lara, 2000-NMCA-073, 129 N.M. 391, 9 P.3d 74.\n\nA trial court is not deprived of jurisdiction to revoke probation if a defendant's original probationary period expires while the defendant is an absconder.— Where defendant was convicted of battery in magistrate court, received a suspended sentence, was placed on probation in lieu of serving a prison sentence, violated the terms of his probation and could not be located to answer for this violation until after the period of his suspended sentence expired, the magistrate court had the authority to issue its order revoking defendant's original probationary sentence and imposing a new sentence, because defendant's probationary period did not run from the date the magistrate court issued the bench warrant to the date of defendant's arrest. The phrase \"whenever the period of suspension expires\" cannot be read to include those instances when a probationary period expires while a defendant has absconded after allegedly violating probation.State v. Begay, 2017-NMSC-009,rev'g2016-NMCA-039, 368 P.3d 1246.\n\nDifference between suspension and deferralis that suspension involves a sentence imposed while deferral does not. With suspension, the sentence having been imposed, the court cannot later alter the sentence upwards. With deferral, no sentence having been imposed, the court may give any sentence it could originally have given.State v. Kenneman, 1982-NMCA-145, 98 N.M. 794, 653 P.2d 170, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 47, 653 P.2d 878.\n\nDefendant's probation could not be revoked after it had expired.— Where, in 2004, defendant pleaded guilty to a fourth-degree aggravated DWI; in 2007, defendant was arrested for another DWI in violation of the 2004 probation conditions; on September 7, 2007, the State filed a petition to revoke defendant probation; the district court scheduled a probation revocation hearing for October 25, 2007 and later reset the hearing for December 20, 2007; and the applicable statutory provisions of Section 66-8-102 NMSA 1978 governing sentence credit for time served on probation were those in effect in 2004, which gave defendant full credit for time served on probation, not those in effect in 2007, which gave defendant no credit for time served on probation; and under the 2004 version of the statute, defendant's probation was scheduled to expire on October 19, 2007, defendant's probation had expired before the probation revocation hearing and the district court did not have authority to revoke defendant's probation.State v. Ordunez, 2012-NMSC-024, 283 P.3d 282.\n\nThe district court is divested of jurisdiction when a probation term expires, and the expiration of jurisdiction cannot be waived.— This section divests the district court of jurisdiction to revoke a defendant's probation when a probation term expires, and this loss of jurisdiction is unaffected by a defendant's waiver of the time limits within which a revocation hearing must be held after a violation of probation is alleged, and staying revocation proceedings to determine the defendant's competency likewise does not toll the district court's loss of jurisdiction.State v. Godkin, 2015-NMCA-114.\n\nWhere defendant appealed the denial of his motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction following remand from a prior appeal in which the New Mexico court of appeals remanded the case for a competency evaluation and for a new revocation hearing, the district court was without jurisdiction to revoke defendant's probation when the probation period expired prior to the revocation hearing, and the stay of proceedings to determine competency likewise did not toll defendant's probation.State v.

With suspension, the sentence having been imposed, the court cannot later alter the sentence upwards. With deferral, no sentence having been imposed, the court may give any sentence it could originally have given. State v. Kenneman, 98 N.M. 794, 653 P.2d 170 (Ct. App.), cert. denied, 99 N.M. 47, 653 P.2d 878 (1982).\n\nLegislature authorized to define court's jurisdiction over sentencing.— It is within the power of the legislature alone to define the court's jurisdiction over the sentencing of offenders. State v. Travarez, 99 N.M. 309, 657 P.2d 636 (Ct. App. 1983).\n\nCourt lacks jurisdiction in probation revocation matter when period of deferred sentence expires.— This section relieves the defendant of any obligations imposed on him by order of the court when the period of his deferred sentence expires, and he is deemed then to have satisfied his liability for the crime. The trial court thereafter lacks jurisdiction to proceed in a probation revocation matter. State v. Travarez, 99 N.M. 309, 657 P.2d 636 (Ct. App. 1983).\n\nPrior conviction, not prior sentence, is dispositive for repeat offender status.— Where defendant was convicted of drug charges in New Mexico; the New Mexico court deferred defendant's sentence for a two-year probationary period; the deferred sentence was a final judgment subject to appeal; and after defendant successfully completed the probation, defendant was entitled to have the New Mexico charges dismissed, the deferred sentence was a prior conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement. United States v. Meraz, 998 F.2d 182 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nSex offender registration.— When a deferred sentence expires and charges are dismissed, a conviction is not eradicated: thus, a defendant convicted under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, Sections 29-11A-1 to 29-11A-8 NMSA 1978, is still subject to the registration requirements of that act. State v.

Att'y Gen. No. 73-44.\n\nRestoration of firearms privileges.— A defendant who receives a deferred sentence is not subject to the criminal sanctions imposed by Section 30-7-16 NMSA 1978, governing receipt, transportation or possession of firearms by felons. Firearms privileges are automatically restored when a person successfully completes the period of a deferred sentence. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-03.\n\nAm.

Double jeopardy does not attach, and a resentencing for the mandatory enhancement provision of Section 31-18-16 NMSA 1978 must stand. State v.

Aaron, 1985-NMCA-060, 103 N.M. 138, 703 P.2d 915.\n\nApplying credit.— Section 31-20-12 NMSA 1978 does not authorize presentence confinement credit unless the confinement was in connection with the offense charged. If, however, the defendant is held in confinement prior to trial or sentencing, simultaneously on two or more charges, presentence confinement credit should be given.State v. Page, 1984-NMCA-012, 100 N.M. 788, 676 P.2d 1353.\n\nConstitutionality.— New Mexico's good time credit statutory scheme does not offend the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law; it is reasonable not to award good time credits for presentence confinement to detainees who are presumed innocent and therefore are not yet subject to rehabilitation efforts or to compulsory labor requirements, especially when they are held without systematic evaluation in county jails lacking rehabilitation programs.State v.

State, 1986-NMSC-070, 104 N.M. 672, 726 P.2d 349.\n\nEqual protection and due process.— New Mexico's statutory scheme, which does not allow good time credit for presentence confinement, does not offend the equal protection and due process guarantees of the New Mexico and United States constitutions.Enright v. State, 1986-NMSC-070, 104 N.M. 672, 726 P.2d 349.\n\nEqual protection does not compel retroactive application.— The equal protection guarantee of the state and federal constitutions does not compel a retroactive application of the provisions of this section, which gives credit for time served prior to conviction.State v. Sedillo, 1968-NMCA-033, 79 N.M. 255, 442 P.2d 213.\n\nFailure to give retroactive effect did not violate equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions.State v. Dalrymple, 1968-NMCA-083, 79 N.M. 670, 448 P.2d 182.\n\nNo violation due to newly created right.— There is no denial of equal protection of the laws in failing to give retroactive effect to a newly created right which allows credit for presentence confinement.State v. Thomas, 1968-NMCA-043, 79 N.M. 346, 443 P.2d 516\n\nStatute inapplicable to sentence before its effective date.— This act became effective in 1967. The statute is not applicable to a sentence which was imposed upon defendant in 1963. To so apply it would require that it be given retrospective effect.State v. Padilla, 1968-NMCA-004, 78 N.M. 702, 437 P.2d 163.\n\nNo retroactive effect where presentence confinement preceded effective dates.— Where defendant's presentence confinement time occurred prior to the effective date of this section, the statute is not to be given retroactive effect.State v. Luna, 1968-NMCA-041, 79 N.M. 307, 442 P.2d 797.\n\nPurpose of section.— The purpose of this section is to give some relief to persons who, because of an inability to obtain bail, are held in custody.State v. Howard, 1989-NMCA-029, 108 N.M. 560, 775 P.2d 762, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 433, 773 P.2d 1240.\n\nSection has been strictly interpreted, with resulting benefits to the defendant.State v. Ramzy, 1982-NMCA-113, 98 N.M. 436, 649 P.2d 504.\n\nDefendant was not entitled to double credit for presentence confinement.— Where defendant was convicted of possession of methamphetamine and marijuana, aggravated fleeing a law enforcement officer, two counts of tampering with evidence, resisting arrest, and possession of drug paraphernalia in one case, and, in a separate case, was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon, and where, at sentencing, the district court imposed a prison term for the first case and subtracted presentence confinement credit of 310 days from that sentence, and where defendant later pleaded guilty in the second case and was sentenced to a prison term to run consecutively to his prison term in the first case, and where defendant requested presentence confinement credit for the 225 days he was confined while the second case was pending, even though those days had already been credited against his first case, the district court did not err in denying defendant's request because defendant was not entitled to double credit.State v. Cerda, 2022-NMCA-062, cert. denied.\n\nCompliance with 31-18-21 NMSA 1978.— Section 31-18-21 NMSA 1978 mandates that a sentence for a felony committed while serving a sentence in a penal institution run consecutive to the prior sentence. It is impossible to grant \"presentence\" confinement credit concurrent with time served on the prior sentence and comply with that section, which requires that the sentences run consecutively.State v. Facteau, 1990-NMSC-040, 109 N.M. 748, 790 P.2d 1029.\n\nSentence must have been direct result of felony committed.— This section allows for presentence confinement credit only if the sentence was a direct result of the felony committed.State v. Facteau, 1990-NMSC-040, 109 N.M. 748, 790 P.2d 1029.\n\nDefendant was entitled to presentence confinement credit where charges related to the sentence triggered probation revocation.— Where defendant was convicted of possession of methamphetamine, aggravated fleeing of a law enforcement officer, and resisting, evading or obstructing an officer after leading law enforcement on a vehicle chase from Logan, New Mexico to Tucumcari, New Mexico and, after stopping and exiting the vehicle, leading the officers on a foot chase until he was located in a shed in possession of methamphetamine, and where, at the time of his arrest, defendant was serving a term of probation in two separate criminal cases, and where, at sentencing, the district court denied defendant presentence confinement credit for the time spent in custody due to his probation violations, it was error to deny presentence confinement credit, because the charges in the instant case led to defendant's probation being revoked and triggered defendant's confinement.State v. French, 2021-NMCA-052.\n\nDiscretion of court to determine time credited.— It is for the trial court to determine at the time of sentencing, from relevant documents or other evidence to be made a part of the record, the specific presentence confinement to be credited against any sentence finally imposed for offenses on which an accused has been held.Stewart v. State, 1991-NMSC-095, 112 N.M. 653, 818 P.2d 854.\n\nDiscretion not to apply pre-sentence confinement credit to probation time.— Under Section 31-20-12 NMSA 1978, it is within discretion of the district court not to credit pre-sentence confinement credit to probation time.State v. Nieto, 2013-NMCA-065, 303 P.3d 855, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-004.\n\nWhere defendant spent 103 days in custody pending trial for aggravated assault; defendant's sentence of three years' imprisonment was suspended and defendant was ordered to complete a three-year period of probation; the district court ordered that if defendant's probation were revoked, defendant would be given credit for defendant's pre-sentence confinement of 103 days; and the district court declined to apply the pre-sentence confinement credit to defendant's probation sentence, the district court did not abuse its discretion.State v. Nieto, 2013-NMCA-065, 303 P.3d 855, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-004.\n\nCredit for multiple DWI offenses.— Because the legislature provides in Section 66-8-102 NMSA 1978 that, for a first DWI offender, time spent in jail prior to conviction is to be credited against the offender's sentence, and because fourth and subsequent offenders are felons, who are also granted such credit pursuant to this section, the legislature's silence as to second and third offenses implies an intent to afford courts discretion to grant credit to third and fourth offenders.State v. Martinez, 1998-NMSC-023, 126 N.M. 39, 966 P.2d 747.\n\nCourt may revise sentence to give credit.— Rule 93, N.M.R. Civ. P. (now Rule 1-093 NMRA), specifically authorizes the trial court to correct a sentence.McCroskey v. State, 1970-NMCA-109, 82 N.M. 49, 475 P.2d 49 (decided under prior law).\n\nNo time limit for request for credit.— The authorization contained in Rule 93, N.M.R. Civ. P. (now Rule 1-093 NMRA), is not limited to the term of court during which the incorrect sentence was imposed as a motion for such relief may be made at any time.McCroskey v. State, 1970-NMCA-109, 82 N.M. 49, 475 P.2d 49 (decided under prior law).\n\nCredit to equal presentence confinement period.— A defendant is entitled to one day's credit against his total sentence for each day spent in presentence confinement. Regardless of whether the sentences for multiple felonies are to run concurrently or consecutively, credit is given only for that period actually spent in presentence confinement.State v. Howard, 1989-NMCA-029, 108 N.M. 560, 775 P.2d 762, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 433, 773 P.2d 1240.\n\nHow credit should be granted.— A one-day credit should be granted for every 24 hours, or fraction thereof. For example, if someone is arrested at 10:00 p.m. and released at 9:30 a.m. the next morning, he or she should only get a one-day credit because the confinement is less than 24 hours. If, on the other hand, someone is arrested at 8:00 a.m. and released at 9:30 a.m. the following day, the confinement would amount to a two-day credit because the confinement exceeded a 24 hour period.State v. Miranda, 1989-NMCA-068, 108 N.M. 789, 779 P.2d 976, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 771, 779 P.2d 549.\n\nNo multiplication by number of sentences.— Presentence confinement credit is not to be multiplied by the number of different sentences imposed.State v. Miranda, 1989-NMCA-068, 108 N.M. 789, 779 P.2d 976, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 771, 779 P.2d 549.\n\nConsecutive and concurrent sentences.— An offender who receives consecutive sentences is entitled to presentence incarceration credit only once against the aggregate of all the sentences, while an offender sentenced to concurrent terms in effect receives credit against each sentence.State v. Miranda, 1989-NMCA-068, 108 N.M. 789, 779 P.2d 976, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 771, 779 P.2d 549.\n\nThree-part test to determine whether defendant's multiple criminal cases are sufficiently connected to warrant dual credit.— To determine whether there is enough of a connection to warrant dual credit when a defendant is involved in multiple judicial proceedings, a sentencing court must apply a three-prong test and find: (1) the defendant was not confined in either case; (2) the charges in Case two triggered and caused the confinement in Case one, and (3) the defendant was also confined in Case two. The second prong of the test is not satisfied simply because a defendant's confinement is \"caused by or related to\" Case two, in whole or in part. Rather, the second prong requires a cause-and-effect relationship whereby Case two \"triggers and causes\" the defendant's confinement in Case one. The cause-and-effect relationship is key to concluding that the confinement is directly attributable to both cases.State v. Herrera, 2024-NMCA-025, cert. denied.\n\nDefendant was not entitled to presentence confinement credit for time spent in prison on another case.— Where defendant was already facing charges for identity theft in an unrelated case when she was indicted for fraudulent use of a credit card, for which she was released and out on bond, and where, while out on bond, defendant picked up new charges, and as a result of the new charges, the district court revoked defendant's conditions of release on the credit card charges, and where, the following month, defendant pleaded guilty to the identity theft charges for which she was sentenced to an actual term of four years' imprisonment, and where, following her conviction for fraudulent use of a credit card, for which she was sentenced to five-and-one-half years imprisonment to run consecutively to her prison term in the identity theft case, defendant requested 599 days of presentence confinement credit for the period between her sentence for identity theft and her sentence for fraudulent use of a credit card, the district court did not err in denying defendant's request for presentence confinement credit, because the confinement period was not related to the charges in the case for which credit was sought. Because the required causal relationship was lacking, defendant was not entitled to dual credit.State v. Herrera, 2024-NMCA-025, cert. denied.\n\n\"Double credit\".— Where defendant was out on bond for aggravated battery, arrested for a second crime of domestic violence, had his bond revoked, and was incarcerated until his trials on the separate charges, and was convicted on both charges, he did not have a right to presentence credit for the entire time of his presentence incarceration against both consecutive sentences.State v. Romero, 2002-NMCA-106, 132 N.M. 745, 55 P.3d 441, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 732, 55 P.3d 428.\n\nPresentence confinement must be for crime charged.— This section was not applicable to prisoner who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor committed in the state penitentiary while he was serving a prior sentence, and sought credit on his sentence for the days which elapsed between the day he was served with a warrant for his arrest and the day when judgment and sentence was entered on his plea of guilty, as confinement during this period was pursuant to his prior sentence.State v. Brewton, 1971-NMCA-120, 83 N.M. 50, 487 P.2d 1355.\n\nThe decisive factor in allowing credit for presentence confinement in a case is whether the confinement was actually related to the charges of that particular case. It is not necessary that the confinement be related exclusively to the charges in question.State v. Ramzy, 1982-NMCA-113, 98 N.M. 436, 649 P.2d 504.\n\nThis section does not authorize credit for presentence confinement that is not actually related to the charges of the particular offense.State v. Laskay, 1986-NMCA-008, 103 N.M. 799, 715 P.2d 72, cert. denied, 103 N.M. 798, 715 P.2d 71.\n\nThe determinative issue for presentence confinement credit is whether the basis for the confinement was actually related to the charge upon which the final conviction and sentence are based.State v. Miranda, 1989-NMCA-068, 108 N.M. 789, 779 P.2d 976, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 771, 779 P.2d 549.\n\nConfinement for multiple offenses.— It is not necessary that the confinement in question relate exclusively to the charges against which a defendant seeks credit. Since the defendant in this case was in a Texas jail on both a Texas charge and a New Mexico warrant, he was entitled to credit in New Mexico.State v. Barrios, 1993-NMCA-138, 116 N.M. 580, 865 P.2d 1224.\n\nCredit for time served on invalidated guilty plea.— The defendant was entitled to time served pursuant to a sentence on an invalidated guilty plea even though the counts on which she was convicted at trial were different from the counts to which she had pleaded guilty; there was a causal connection between the charges on which the defendant was convicted and the sentence pursuant to the invalidated plea.State v. Wittgenstein, 1995-NMCA-010, 119 N.M. 565, 893 P.2d 461.\n\nIf transfer of confinement unrelated to charge in question, no confinement credit.— Where the defendant is already confined on an unrelated charge and there is a transfer of the place of confinement, the actual confinement being unrelated to the charge in question, the trial court is correct in denying the defendant's motion for presentence confinement credit.State v. Orona, 1982-NMCA-143, 98 N.M. 668, 651 P.2d 1312.\n\nPresentence confinement credit properly awarded.— The trial court had discretion to award defendant presentence confinement credit for that time spent in custody after his parole was revoked based on the drug paraphernalia charge for which he was ultimately sentenced in this case.State v. Irvin, 1992-NMCA-121, 114 N.M. 597, 844 P.2d 847.\n\nHospitalization after being taken into custody.— The fact that defendant was hospitalized following his being taken into custody did not preclude award of presentence confinement credit for the time spent in the hospital.State v. Watchman, 1991-NMCA-010, 111 N.M. 727, 809 P.2d 641, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 529, 807 P.2d 227,overruled in part on other grounds byState v. Hosteen, 1996-NMCA-084, 122 N.M. 228, 923 P.2d 595.\n\nConfinement in mental hospital after arrest constitutes \"official confinement\".— Defendant was committed under Section 31-9-1 NMSA 1978 to the state hospital and confined therein for 463 days after being found incapable of assisting in his defense on pending felony charges, lacking in the mental capacity to stand trial, and in need of care, custody and treatment in a mental hospital, with provision that he be at all times under maximum security conditions and not be released without further written order of the court, it was held that defendant had been under official confinement on charges of committing a felony and was therefore entitled under this statute to credit against his sentence for presentence confinement time spent in the hospital.State v. La Badie, 1975-NMCA-032, 87 N.M. 391, 534 P.2d 483.\n\nMental hospital confinement.— Confinement in a mental hospital after arrest constitutes \"official confinement\", as outlined in this section.State v. Miranda, 1989-NMCA-068, 108 N.M. 789, 779 P.2d 976, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 771, 779 P.2d 549.\n\nElectronic monitoring program.— A defendant is entitled to presentence confinement credit for time under house arrest pursuant to an electronic monitoring program if the defendant is in constructive custody and can be punished for escape for non-compilance with the house arrest order.State v. Duhon, 2005-NMCA-120, 138 N.M. 466, 122 P.3d 50, cert. quashed, 2006-NMCERT-003, 139 N.M. 352, 132 P.3d 1038.\n\nVoluntary treatment program not \"confinement\" under this section.— Presentence confinement credit against a felony DWI jail sentence may not be given for time spent in an inpatient alcohol treatment program, where the state did not require defendant's participation in the program and exercised no control over him while he was in the program.State v. Clah, 1997-NMCA-091, 124 N.M. 6, 946 P.2d 210, cert. denied, 123 N.M. 626, 944 P.2d 274.\n\nHouse arrest as \"official confinement\".— Time spent outside of jail may qualify as \"official confinement\" for the purposes of receiving presentence confinement credit under this section when: (1) a court has entered an order releasing the defendant from a facility but has imposed limitations on the defendant's freedom of movement, or the defendant is in the actual or constructive custody of state or local law enforcement or correctional officers; and (2) the defendant is punishable for a crime of escape if there is an unauthorized departure from the place of confinement or other non-compliance with the court's order.State v. Fellhauer, 1997-NMCA-064, 123 N.M. 476, 943 P.2d 123, cert. denied, 123 N.M. 446, 942 P.2d 189.\n\nCondition that a drunk driving defendant remain at his home at all times except to attend alcohol counseling, work, or religious services was a sufficient limitation on his freedom of movement to meet the first subprong of theFellhauertest and to therefore entitle him to presentence credit for time spent under house arrest.State v. Guillen, 2001-NMCA-079, 130 N.M. 803, 32 P.3d 812.\n\nPresentence confinement credit allowed where conditions of release were sufficiently onerous to be deemed official confinement.— Where defendant was charged with kidnapping, attempted first-degree murder, aggravated burglary with a deadly weapon, or in the alternative, aggravated burglary by battery, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, or alternatively, resulting in great bodily harm, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and child abuse, and where, following defendant's arrest, the district court ordered defendant released from jail into third-party custody under conditions that defendant was required to be on pretrial service supervision, required to abide by all conditions set by the court and pretrial services, prohibited from leaving his residence without prior permission of pretrial services, and required to submit to GPS monitoring to ensure compliance, the district court erred in denying defendant presentence confinement credit where defendant was subject to limitations on movement such that he could have been charged with escape from a community custody release program if there was an unauthorized departure from the place of confinement or other non-compliance with the court's order. Defendant's freedom of movement was sufficiently onerous to be deemed official confinement, entitling him to presentence confinement credit.State v. Hansen, 2021-NMCA-048, cert. denied.\n\nDefendant was not entitled to presentence confinement credit for pretrial release that was insufficiently restrictive.— Where defendant was convicted of two counts of criminal sexual penetration of a minor in the second degree, and where, at sentencing, the district court entered a judgment and sentence that credited defendant with 205 days of presentence confinement and additional time spent incarcerated prior to sentencing, but denied credit for pretrial release where defendant was subject to a conventional curfew, the trial court did not err in determining that defendant was not entitled to credit for time he spent on conditions of release because the conditions were insufficiently restrictive.State v. Figueroa, 2020-NMCA-007, cert. denied.\n\nWhen no credit authorized by section.— If a past confinement is not in connection with the present offense charged, this section does not authorize a credit.State v. Barefield, 1979-NMCA-060, 92 N.M. 768, 595 P.2d 406.\n\nDefendant was not entitled to 11 months of presentence confinementcredit against his sentence for escape from the penitentiary, where he was serving time on a burglary charge when he escaped, where he was captured and was immediately incarcerated to continue to serve time on his burglary charge, and where he was later sentenced to an additional nine years for the escape to run consecutively to his original charge.State v. Facteau, 1990-NMSC-040, 109 N.M. 748, 790 P.2d 1029.\n\nConditions of confinement not relevant.— When the defendant had not appeared for sentencing following a guilty plea, was later found in California serving a sentence for another crime, and a New Mexico detainer was lodged against him as a result of which the conditions of his confinement became more onerous, he was not entitled to credit for the time served in California after lodging of the detainer since his confinement there was not due to the New Mexico charges.State v. Ruiz, 1995-NMCA-093, 120 N.M. 420, 902 P.2d 575, cert. denied, 120 N.M. 394, 902 P.2d 76.\n\nApplication to delinquent offenders.— The presentence confinement credit provided for in Sections 31-18-15.3 and 31-20-12 NMSA 1978 applies only to serious youthful offenders sentenced as adults, and not to a child adjudicated as a delinquent offender for a lesser-included offense.State v. Nanco, 2012-NMCA-109, 288 P.3d 527, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-010.\n\nWhere the child, who was fifteen years old, was charged with committing first degree murder and two counts of tampering with evidence, and the jury determined that the child had committed the delinquent acts of voluntary manslaughter and one count with tampering with evidence, the child was not entitled to presentence confinement credit for the twenty-five months the child was detained in a juvenile detention facility before the district court adjudicated the child a delinquent offender.State v. Nanco, 2012-NMCA-109, 288 P.3d 527, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-010.\n\nApplication of section prospective only.— All persons convicted of a felony or of a lesser included offense, as of March 31, 1967, are to be given credit against any sentence imposed for that offense for all time spent in presentence confinement. This section is prospective only, and does not apply to those convicted before that date. 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-66.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Home Alone: Why House Arrest Doesn't Qualify for Presentence Confinement Credit in New Mexico - State v. Fellhauer,\" see 28 N.M.L. Rev. 519 (1998).\n\nAm.

      "heading": "Conditional discharge order; exception.",
      "text": "A. When a person who has not been previously convicted of a felony offense is found guilty of a crime for which a deferred or suspended sentence is authorized, the court may, without entering an adjudication of guilt, enter a conditional discharge order and place the person on probation on terms and conditions authorized by Sections 31-20-5 and 31-20-6 NMSA 1978. A conditional discharge order may only be made available once with respect to any person.\n\nB. If the person violates any of the conditions of probation, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided by law.\n\nC. The court shall not enter a conditional discharge order for a person found guilty of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, pursuant to the provisions of Section 66-8-102 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:Laws 1993, ch. 283, § 2 enacted as 31-20-7 NMSA 1978 and recompiled as 31-20-13 NMSA 1978; 1994, ch. 15, § 1.\n\nThe 1994 amendment,effective February 25, 1994, added \"exception\" at the end of the section heading, added the second sentence in Subsection A and added Subsection C.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 1993, ch. 283, § 2 enacted this section as a new 31-20-7 NMSA 1978. However, this section has been compiled as 31-20-13 NMSA 1978 in order to avoid confusion with repealed section 31-20-7 NMSA 1978 which has been construed or cited in a number of New Mexico decisions.\n\nA conditional discharge is not a conviction.— Where the district court had entered a conditional discharge order in a prior criminal proceeding against defendant; the order was entered without an adjudication of guilt and with a sentencing term; defendant's probation was subsequently revoked and defendant was placed back on probation; a year later, defendant's probation was again revoked and the district court ordered that defendant be incarcerated; and the district court did not revoke defendant's conditional discharge, the district court did not err by dismissing a later felon in possession charge against defendant on the ground that defendant's conditional discharge had not been revoked and could not serve as the predicate felony for the felon in possession charge.State v. Harris, 2013-NMCA-031, 297 P.3d 374.\n\nA conditional discharge constitutes a \"prior sentence\" for federal sentencing purposes.— Where defendant pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute controlled substances in federal court, defendant's conditional discharge in a prior state criminal proceeding was considered a \"prior sentence\" rather than a prior conviction for purposes of federal sentencing, because the New Mexico conditional discharge statute requires a finding of guilt.United States v. Ornelas-Yanez, 77 F.Supp.3d 1083 (D.N.M. 2014)\n\nAn offender subject to a conditional discharge is still \"under indictment\" for purposes of federal firearms statute.— An offender subject to a conditional discharge in state court is still \"under indictment\" within the meaning of federal firearms statute, 18 U.S.C. § 922(n), until the condition, the completion of the term of probation, is met, because under a conditional discharge, the charges in the indictment are not extinguished upon the guilty plea or verdict, but remain in suspension until the defendant completes his term of probation.United States v. Saiz, 797 F.3d 853 (10th. Cir. 2015)\n\nWhere defendant committed federal firearms offenses while still on probation in state court pursuant to a conditional discharge where he pleaded guilty to burglary, larceny and battery, and where the state district court judge placed defendant on probation without an adjudication of guilt on the state crimes, the federal district court judge did not err in adding two sentencing enhancements after finding that defendant was \"under indictment\" for the state crimes as long as he was subject to the terms of conditional discharge and, therefore, had been under indictment when he committed the federal crimes.United States v. Saiz, 797 F.3d 853 (10th. Cir. 2015)\n\nThe conditional discharge statute does not grant the authority to expunge criminal records.State v. C. L., 2010-NMCA-050, 148 N.M. 837, 242 P.3d 404.\n\nFailure to show exceptional circumstances to expunge criminal records.— Where defendant was charged as an accessory to negligent child abuse; defendant pleaded guilty to child abuse resulting in great bodily harm; defendant was granted a conditional discharge and was released early due to defendant's satisfactory compliance with the terms of release; defendant was denied employment opportunities as a result of defendant's criminal record; defendant had been industrious and continued defendant's education; and defendant had no prior criminal record, assuming that the district court has inherent authority to order the expungement of criminal records, defendant failed to demonstrate the existence of exceptional circumstances necessary to exercise that authority.State v. C. L., 2010-NMCA-050, 148 N.M. 837, 242 P.3d 404.\n\nLegislative intent.— The legislature's intent is that a defendant receive credit for time served on supervised probation under the terms of a conditional discharge.State v. Leslie, 2004-NMCA-106, 136 N.M. 244, 96 P.3d 805.\n\nThis section provides an exception for certain first-time felonswhose convictions meet requirements in addition to the eligibility requirements for a deferred or suspended sentence.State v. Leslie, 2004-NMCA-106, 136 N.M. 244, 96 P.3d 805.\n\nSubsection A of this section expressly incorporates probation statutesthat apply to a person serving a deferred sentence.State v. Leslie, 2004-NMCA-106, 136 N.M. 244, 96 P.3d 805.\n\nPerson who is eligible to receive conditional dischargeis by definition one who is entitled to a deferred sentence.State v. Leslie, 2004-NMCA-106, 136 N.M. 244, 96 P.3d 805.\n\nDeferred sentence modified to conditional discharge.— Modification from a deferred sentence to a conditional discharge was an authorized sentence reduction under this section and Rule 5-801 NMRA.State v. Herbstman, 1999-NMCA-014, 126 N.M. 683, 974 P.2d 177.\n\nSex offender registration.— A person granted a conditional discharge under this section is not required to register as a sex offender.State v. Herbstman, 1999-NMCA-014, 126 N.M. 683, 974 P.2d 177.\n\nNotice requiring defendant to register as a sex offender pursuant to 29-11A-7 NMSA 1978 did not need to be placed in a conditional discharge order.State v. Herbstman, 1999-NMCA-014, 126 N.M. 683, 974 P.2d 177.\n\nAppealability of order.— A conditional discharge order in a felony prosecution is sufficiently final to be appealable, but a similar order in a criminal contempt prosecution is not, at least when the order does not require any action or behavior on the part of the contemnor other than to obey the law in the future.State v. Durant, 2000-NMCA-066, 129 N.M. 345, 7 P.3d 495.\n\nConditional discharge order final for purposes of appeal.— Where defendant appealed from an order of conditional discharge following his trial for criminal trespass, the district court's order was final for purposes of appeal because defendant was subject to significant collateral consequences as a result of his conditional discharge, including claims that he would be required to disclose the fact of his conviction on applications for employment, college, and other future pursuits.State v. Merhege, 2016-NMCA-059,rev'd on other grounds, 2017-NMSC-016.",
