      "text": "If a jury finds, beyond a reasonable doubt, that one or more aggravating circumstances exist, as enumerated in Section 31-20A-5 NMSA 1978, the defendant shall be sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of release or parole. If the jury does not make the finding that one or more aggravating circumstances exist, the defendant shall be sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nHistory:Laws 1979, ch. 150, § 3.; 2009, ch. 11, § 3.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, deleted former Subsections A and B, which provided for capital sentencing deliberations, and added the sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of release or parole upon a finding of aggravating circumstances.\n\nApplicability clause.— Laws 2009, ch. 11, § 6 provided that the provisions of this section apply to crimes committed on or after July 1, 2009.\n\nAdmission of evidence.— In the penalty phase of a capital felony case, evidence of the defendant's prior convictions may be admitted only if the state first establishes the relevance of the prior convictions to the jury's selection of the sentence and the district court must facilitate the weighing by the jury of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, on a case-by-case basis, according to the evidentiary rules of relevance and reliability and the Capital Felony Sentencing Act's [repealed] statutory directives.State v. Sanchez, 2008-NMSC-066, 145 N.M. 31, 198 P.3d 337.\n\nConstitutionality.— This section, directing the jury to weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances, consider the defendant and the crime, and then determine the sentence, is not vague and indefinite, and thus does not violate a defendant's due process and equal protection rights.State v. Clark, 1999-NMSC-035, 128 N.M. 119, 990 P.2d 793.\n\nAggravating circumstances need not be beyond reasonable doubt.— There is no requirement that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Finnell, 1984-NMSC-064, 101 N.M. 732, 688 P.2d 769, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 918, 105 S. Ct. 297, 83 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1984).\n\nThe jury is not required to find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt in order to specify a sentence of death.State v. Fry, 2006-NMSC-001, 138 N.M. 700, 126 P.3d 516.\n\nVictim impact testimony.— Victim impact testimony is consistent with the Capital Felony Sentencing Act [repealed] because it constitutes additional evidence as to the circumstances of the crime under Section 31-20A-1C NMSA 1978 [repealed] and Subsection B of this section.State v. Clark, 1999-NMSC-035, 128 N.M. 119, 990 P.2d 793.\n\nThe effective date of the victim's rights laws did not affect the admission of victim impact evidence in a death penalty case. States are free to admit this type of evidence following the United States supreme court's ruling inPayne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808 (1991), and Section 31-20A-1C NMSA 1978 [repealed] and Subsection B of this section already provide authority for the admission of this type of evidence.State v. Allen, 2000-NMSC-002, 128 N.M. 482, 994 P.2d 728, cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1218, 120 S. Ct. 2225, 147 L. Ed. 2d 256 (2000).\n\nThe Rules of Evidence requiring relevance and the balancing of unfair prejudice also apply to testimony and exhibits that are introduced in a capital felony sentencing proceeding for the purpose of showing victim impact.State v. Allen, 2000-NMSC-002, 128 N.M. 482, 994 P.2d 728, cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1218, 120 S. Ct. 2225, 147 L. Ed. 2d 256 (2000).\n\nDefendant was not unfairly prejudiced by impact evidence that included a videotaped depiction of the victim prior to her death in addition to the testimony of two witnesses.State v. Allen, 2000-NMSC-002, 128 N.M. 482, 994 P.2d 728, cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1218, 120 S. Ct. 2225, 147 L. Ed. 2d 256 (2000).\n\nLack of mitigating circumstances.— Defendant's failure to show any mitigating circumstances, in and of itself, is not an aggravating circumstance.State v. Allen, 2000-NMSC-002, 128 N.M. 482, 994 P.2d 728, cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1218, 120 S. Ct. 2225, 147 L. Ed. 2d 256 (2000).\n\nSentencing scheme is silent with regard to bifurcated proceedings.— In an interlocutory appeal, where defendant was charged with first-degree murder, a capital felony, and with one count each of first-degree kidnapping, robbery, and conspiracy to commit robbery, and where defendant argued that due to her possible sentence of life without the possibility of parole, she must be afforded heightened procedural protections that apply when the state seeks the death penalty, the New Mexico supreme court held that the Capital Felony Sentencing Act neither requires nor prohibits bifurcated guilt and sentencing proceedings, and whether bifurcated proceedings are appropriate must be determined on a case-by-case basis, after the issue has been properly raised and argued under the rules of criminal procedure for the district courts.State v. Chadwick-Mcnally, 2018-NMSC-018.\n\nEvidence of mitigating circumstances prohibited.— In an interlocutory appeal, where defendant was charged with first-degree murder, a capital felony, and with one count each of first-degree kidnapping, robbery, and conspiracy to commit robbery, and where defendant argued that the sentencing scheme under the Capital Felony Sentencing Act (Act) does not prohibit the presentation of mitigating circumstances, the district court did not err in concluding that defendant is precluded under the Act from presenting evidence of mitigating circumstances for sentencing purposes, because under the statute's plain language, the determinative factors are the jury's findings of guilt and of one or more aggravating circumstances. When both findings are present, a sentence of life without parole is mandatory and cannot be mitigated.State v. Chadwick-Mcnally, 2018-NMSC-018.\n\nComparative proportionality review under former statute.— A comparative proportionality review is a post-sentence inquiry into whether a death sentence is disproportionate to the punishment imposed on others convicted of the same crime.Fry v. Lopez and Allen v. LeMaster, 2019-NMSC-013.\n\nModified approach to comparative proportionality review of a death sentence under former statute.— In New Mexico's modified approach to comparative proportionality review, the reviewing court defines a universe of cases from which similar cases are to be drawn, defines what constitutes a similar case, which produces a pool of cases to be used for comparison purposes, and defines the test used to establish that a sentence is disproportionate. The universe of cases is properly limited to those cases in which the prosecutor decided to seek the death penalty, which advanced to a death penalty sentencing hearing in which the jury found at least one aggravating circumstance, which resulted in a sentence of death or life imprisonment and which was affirmed on appeal, the pool of cases is expanded to include both cases involving the same aggravating circumstance and factually similar cases in which the jury had the option to impose the death penalty, and New Mexico adheres to a precedent-seeking approach, which involves comparing the case to the pool of comparison cases.Fry v. Lopez and Allen v. LeMaster, 2019-NMSC-013.\n\nDisproportionate death sentence under former statute construed.— A death sentence is disproportionate if juries do not generally impose a death sentence in similar cases and there is no real justification for the death sentence.Fry v. Lopez and Allen v. LeMaster, 2019-NMSC-013.\n\nDeath penalties under former statute vacated where petitioners' death sentences were statutorily disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases.— Where petitioners were sentenced to death for their respective convictions for first-degree murder and after a finding by their respective juries of certain aggravating circumstances, petitioners' death sentences were statutorily disproportionate, because cases involving the same aggravating circumstances as well as other factually similar cases as in Fry and Allen did not generally result in death sentences, and there was no real justification for affirming the death sentences.Fry v. Lopez and Allen v. LeMaster, 2019-NMSC-013.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Constitutionality of the New Mexico Capital Punishment Statute,\" see 11 N.M.L. Rev. 269 (1981).\n\nFor comment, \"State v. Jacobs: A Comment on One State's Choice to Restrict Victim Impact Evidence at Death Penalty Sentencing,\" see 31 N.M.L. Rev. 539 (2001).",

      "heading": "Aggravating circumstances.",
      "text": "The aggravating circumstances to be considered by the sentencing court or jury pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-20A-2 NMSA 1978 are limited to the following:\n\nA. the victim was a peace officer who was acting in the lawful discharge of an official duty when he was murdered;\n\nB. the murder was committed with intent to kill in the commission of or attempt to commit kidnaping, criminal sexual contact of a minor or criminal sexual penetration;\n\nC. the murder was committed with the intent to kill by the defendant while attempting to escape from a penal institution of New Mexico;\n\nD. while incarcerated in a penal institution in New Mexico, the defendant, with the intent to kill, murdered a person who was at the time incarcerated in or lawfully on the premises of a penal institution in New Mexico. As used in this subsection \"penal institution\" includes facilities under the jurisdiction of the corrections and criminal rehabilitation department [corrections department] and county and municipal jails;\n\nE. while incarcerated in a penal institution in New Mexico, the defendant, with the intent to kill, murdered an employee of the corrections and criminal rehabilitation department [corrections department];\n\nF. the capital felony was committed for hire; and\n\nG. the capital felony was murder of a witness to a crime or any person likely to become a witness to a crime, for the purpose of preventing report of the crime or testimony in any criminal proceeding, or for retaliation for the victim having testified in any criminal proceeding.\n\nHistory:Laws 1979, ch. 150, § 6; 1981, ch. 23, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material in Subsections D and E was inserted by the compiler, as Laws 1981, ch. 73, § 1, changed the name of the former corrections and criminal rehabilitation department, referred to in Subsections D and E, to the corrections department.See9-3-3 NMSA 1978. The bracketed material is not part of the law.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nAggravating circumstance.— The only underlying felonies for felony murder that can serve as an aggravating circumstance for capital sentencing are kidnapping, criminal sexual contact of a minor and criminal sexual penetration. In addition, prosecution must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had an intent to kill.State v. Fry, 2006-NMSC-001, 138 N.M. 700, 126 P.3d 516.\n\nLegislative intent.— The legislature has demonstrated its intent to protect corrections officers and jailers and to deter crimes against them during the course of their duties of maintaining order in penal facilities.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nThis section provides sufficiently clear and objective standardsthat provide specific and detailed guidance and that make the process for imposing the death sentence rationally reviewable.State v. Garcia, 1983-NMSC-008, 99 N.M. 771, 664 P.2d 969.\n\nGuadalupe county correctional facility is a penal institutionwithin the plain language of this section. The fact that the correctional facility housed inmates from the department of corrections rather than county inmates is immaterial both for the definition of \"local jail\" in Section 33-3-28 NMSA 1978 and the definition of \"penal institution\" in this section.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nElements of crime and elements of aggravating circumstance distinguished.— Simply because there are sufficient elements present to prove more than one crime in the same transaction does not mean that more than one aggravating circumstance has been proven. While the same elements may be present in both instances, establishing the elements of an aggravating circumstance is not the same thing as establishing the elements of a crime.State v. Henderson, 1990-NMSC-030, 109 N.M. 655, 789 P.2d 603,overruled on other grounds byClark v. Tansey, 1994-NMSC-098, 118 N.M. 486, 882 P.2d 527.\n\nInvalidation of one where more than one aggravating circumstance.— When two or more aggravating circumstances are found, the invalidation of one will not invalidate the sentencing proceeding unless the invalidation is due to constitutionally protected conduct.State v. Cheadle, 1983-NMSC-093, 101 N.M. 282, 681 P.2d 708, cert. denied, 466 U.S. 945, 104 S. Ct. 1930, 80 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1984).\n\nFailure to allege aggravating circumstances.— Death penalty proceedings are not precluded where the indictment does not allege the existence of aggravating circumstances. Since aggravating circumstances are not elements of the crime of murder, an indictment is not deficient for failure to allege them.State v. Morton, 1988-NMCA-063, 107 N.M. 478, 760 P.2d 170 (decided under prior law).\n\nLack of mitigating circumstances.— Defendant's failure to show any mitigating circumstances, in and of itself, is not an aggravating circumstance.State v. Allen, 2000-NMSC-002, 128 N.M. 482, 994 P.2d 728, cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1218, 120 S. Ct. 2225, 147 L. Ed. 2d 256 (2000).\n\nII. PEACE OFFICER.\n\nSubsection A concerns penalty for crime against peace officer,and therefore, Sections 33-1-10 NMSA 1978 and 33-3-28 NMSA 1978 serve as powerful indicators of the legislature's intent in Subsection A of this section.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nLegislature intended broad interpretation of Subsection A's aggravating circumstanceto advance the purpose of protecting those who maintain order.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nSubsection A is not duplicative of Subsection E.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\n\"Peace officer\" in Subsection A includes jailers and corrections officerswhile they are engaged in the duties for which the legislature designated them to be peace officers in Sections 33-3-28 and 33-1-10 NMSA 1978.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nBy designating corrections officers and jailers as peace officers under certain circumstances, the legislature intended to provide them with the extra protection and added deterrent value of Subsection A of this section.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nThe legislature intended to include corrections officers and jailers as peace officers in Subsection A of this section.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nThere is an intent on the part of the legislature to treat corrections officers, jailers, and any employee of a local jail whose principal duty is to hold inmates in custody as peace officers for purposes of Subsection A of this section when these individuals are murdered during the discharge of duties conferring peace officer status.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nDefinition of \"peace officer\" in Section 30-1-12C NMSA 1978 is not directly applicableto Subsection A of this section because that definition applies only to the Criminal Code.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nDefendant need not know victim was police officer.— The aggravating circumstance of killing a peace officer, as outlined in Subsection A, can constitutionally support the imposition of the death sentence even where the jury does not find that a defendant knew that his victim was a peace officer.State v. Compton, 1986-NMSC-010, 104 N.M. 683, 726 P.2d 837, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 890, 107 S. Ct. 291, 93 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986).\n\nCommunity service officers are peace officersunder this section.State v. Ogden, 1994-NMSC-029, 118 N.M. 234, 880 P.2d 845, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 936, 115 S. Ct. 336, 130 L. Ed. 2d 294.\n\nProbable cause established that deceased was peace officer.— By establishing that the Guadalupe county correctional facility had a contract with the County, that deceased was employed by the correctional facility as a corrections officer, and that he was performing the duties of a corrections officer at the time of his death, the state established probable cause to believe that deceased was a peace officer within the meaning of Subsection A of this section.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nIII. MURDER.\n\nSubsection D is not duplicative of Subsection Abecause Subsection D of this section also applies to individuals other than corrections officers, including visitors and other inmates.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nSubsection B allows jury to consider any or all listed crimes as separate aggravating circumstances.State v. Guzman, 1984-NMSC-016, 100 N.M. 756, 676 P.2d 1321, cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1256, 104 S. Ct. 3548, 82 L. Ed. 2d 851 (1984).\n\nWhen the evidence shows that more than one aggravating circumstance exists under Subsection B, any and all of the listed crimes may be considered as separate aggravating circumstances. The use of multiple instructions in these circumstances is proper.State v. Jacobs, 2000-NMSC-026, 129 N.M. 448, 10 P.3d 127,overruled on other grounds by State v. Martinez, 2021-NMSC-002.\n\nSubsection D applies to anyone lawfully on premisesof a penal institution, not just certified corrections officers.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nCompleteness of corrections officer's training had no effect on officer's lawful presenceat the correctional facility. Where the officer was an employee of the facility and was authorized by the facility administrators to be on the premises at the time of his killing, the officer was lawfully present at the facility within the plain meaning of Subsection D of this section.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nLegislative purpose of aggravating circumstance in Subsection Dof this section is to deter inmates from committing murder.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nSubsection E and Subsection D are designedto deter murders committed by inmates.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nMurder in the commission of kidnapping.— The fact that all of the elements of the crime of kidnapping were satisfied before the murder occurred did not preclude a finding that the victim was murdered in the commission of kidnapping. The evidence substantially supported a finding that the kidnapping continued throughout the course of defendant's other crimes and until the time of the victim's death.State v. Allen, 2000-NMSC-002, 128 N.M. 482, 994 P.2d 728, cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1218, 120 S. Ct. 2225, 147 L. Ed. 2d 256 (2000).\n\nAlthough evidence was presented that defendant initiated the kidnapping well before and separately from the commission of other felonies, the kidnapping continued until the time of the victim's death; thus, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the victim was murdered during the commission of a kidnapping.State v. Jacobs, 2000-NMSC-026, 129 N.M. 448, 10 P.3d 127,overruled on other grounds by State v. Martinez, 2021-NMSC-002.\n\n\"Murder in commission of kidnapping\" properly applied.— Evidence that murder victim was found with hands bound behind her back and had severe injuries from which she died, that victim's injuries were inflicted after she was kidnapped, that victim was beaten and stabbed multiple times, and that defendant laughed at victim when she begged him to stop was sufficient to establish defendant's intent to kill in the commission of a kidnapping.State v. Martinez, 2006-NMSC-007, 139 N.M.152, 130 P.3d 731.\n\nDeath penalty sentencing is the subject of its own statute, which defines a limited number of aggravating circumstances, and the absence of mitigating circumstances is simply not one of them.State v. Roper, 2001-NMCA-093, 131 N.M. 189, 34 P.3d 133, cert. quashed, 131 N.M. 619, 41 P.3d 345 (decided under prior law).\n\nHiding, then shooting victim, supports death sentence.— Defendant's death penalty sentence was not disproportionate or excessive where defendant walked from his hotel room to a position of hiding and, when the opportunity presented itself, he shot his victim, a police officer, through the heart.State v. Compton, 1986-NMSC-010, 104 N.M. 683, 726 P.2d 837, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 890, 107 S. Ct. 291, 93 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)(decided under prior law).\n\nSubsection G not overbroad.— There is no merit to the argument that the aggravating circumstance of murder of a witness to a crime for the purpose of preventing the reporting of that crime is overbroad and unconstitutional. In order to prove the existence of this aggravating circumstance the state must prove that the killing was motivated by a desire to escape criminal prosecution for an earlier felony committed against the victim or some other person. The need for proof of motivation is sufficient to distinguish between this aggravating circumstance and that of a killing committed during the commission of a kidnapping, the second statutory aggravating circumstance submitted to the jury in defendant's case.Clark v. Tansy, 1994-NMSC-098, 118 N.M. 486, 882 P.2d 527.\n\nDeath penalty eligibility in Subsection G of Section 31-20A-5 NMSA 1978,requires compelling evidence that makes it reasonably probable, not just possible, that defendant's motive for committing murder was to silence a witness. To the extent State v. Henderson, 109 N.M. 655, 789 P.2d 603 (1990), upholds the murder-of-a-witness motive, when the only evidence of motive is the lack of other plausible motives and defendant's attempts to destroy evidence to conceal involvement in a crime, then to that extent State v. Henderson, 1990-NMSC-030, 109 N.M. 655, 789 P.2d 603, is overturned.State v. Martinez, 2006-NMSC-007, 139 N.M.152, 130 P.3d 731 (decided under prior law).\n\n\"Murder of witness\" aggravating circumstance properly appliedto defendant, who murdered a child he had kidnapped in order to prevent her from testifying against him.State v. Clark, 1989-NMSC-010, 108 N.M. 288, 772 P.2d 322, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 923, 110 S. Ct. 291, 107 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1989),overruled on other grounds by State v. Henderson, 1996-NMCA-089, 109 N.M. 655, 789 P.2d 603.\n\nMurder of witness.— Evidence showing that defendant raped and murdered his victim, and then attempted to avoid detection by destroying evidence at the scene that would tie him to the crime, was sufficient to establish the aggravating circumstance of murder of a witness.State v. Henderson, 1990-NMSC-030, 109 N.M. 655, 789 P.2d 603,overruled on other grounds byClark v. Tansey, 1994-NMSC-098, 118 N.M. 486, 882 P.2d 527.\n\nEvidence did not establish the statutory aggravating circumstance of killing in the commission of a kidnapping, where it was not clear that defendant intended to kill his victim during the commission of a kidnapping and it was more likely that he intended to kill the victim because she was a potential witness against him.State v. Henderson, 1990-NMSC-030, 109 N.M. 655, 789 P.2d 603,overruled on other grounds byClark v. Tansey, 1994-NMSC-098, 118 N.M. 486, 882 P.2d 527.\n\nEvidence that the defendant went to the victim's house with the intent to rob her and formed the intent to kill her only after he discovered that the police were outside was sufficient to show there was probable cause that the aggravating circumstance of killing of a witness existed.State v. Willis, 1997-NMSC-014, 123 N.M. 55, 933 P.2d 854.\n\nEvidence, including statements that defendant made to his wife to the effect that he had raped a girl and killed her to prevent her from reporting the rape, was sufficient to support the aggravating circumstance of murder of a witness.State v. Allen, 2000-NMSC-002, 128 N.M. 482, 994 P.2d 728, cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1218, 120 S. Ct. 2225, 147 L. Ed. 2d 256 (2000).\n\nEvidence that victim of ongoing robbery grabbed the telephone immediately before being shot was insufficient to support a reasonable inference that defendant formed a specific intent to kill for the purpose of silencing a witness.State v. Treadway, 2006-NMSC-008, 139 N.M. 167, 130 P.3d 746.\n\n\"Murder of witness\" not properly applied.— The \"murder of a witness\" aggravating circumstance was not properly applied since there was no evidence that the defendant intended to kill his son as a witness to other crimes of the defendant, and there was evidence supporting the theory that the defendant suffered from the paranoid hallucination that he was being pursued by the devil and that he killed his son because he believed the devil had entered his son's body.State v. Smith, 1997-NMSC-017, 123 N.M. 52, 933 P.2d 851.\n\nWhere evidence established that defendant placed shirt over window to conceal his involvement in a robbery in which two persons were murdered, that defendant attempted to hide gems and a gun he took in the robbery, that defendant admitted to police that he went to the victim's house to steal gems and that the robbery had gone bad, and that defendant lied to police about his role in the killings and where the evidence indicated that defendant killed one victim quickly leaving defendant little time to form a specific intent to kill for the purpose of silencing a witness, and where evidence implied that it was possible that the other victim was killed to silence her, the evidence was insufficient to establish a reasonable probability that defendant's motive for the killings was to silence witnesses.State v. Martinez, 2006-NMSC-007, 139 N.M.152, 130 P.3d 731.\n\nUse of factors at pretrial hearing.— At a pretrial hearing to consider whether the state may seek the death penalty, the state could show there was probable cause that the aggravating circumstance of killing a witness was present, and the state was not required to prove the aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Willis, 1997-NMSC-014, 123 N.M. 55, 933 P.2d 854 (decided under prior law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Constitutionality of the New Mexico Capital Punishment Statute,\" see 11 N.M.L.
