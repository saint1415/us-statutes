      "text": "A. Payment of a fine pursuant to a penalty assessment citation shall not be considered a criminal conviction.\n\nB. Whenever a person is issued a penalty assessment under the Criminal Code, the officer shall advise the person of the option either to accept the penalty assessment and pay it to the court or to appear in court. The officer, using a uniform non-traffic citation, shall complete the information section, prepare the penalty assessment and prepare a notice to appear in court specifying the time and place to appear. The citation shall state the address to which the penalty assessment is to be paid if the person accepts the penalty assessment and does not elect to appear in court. The officer shall have the person sign the citation as a promise either to pay the penalty assessment as prescribed or to appear in court as specified, give a copy of the citation to the person and release the person from custody. An officer shall not accept custody of payment of any penalty assessment.\n\nC. The officer may issue a warning notice, but shall fill in the information section of the citation and give a copy to the person after requiring a signature on the warning notice as an acknowledgment of receipt.\n\nD. In order to secure release, the person shall give a written promise to appear in court or to pay the penalty assessment prescribed or acknowledge receipt of a warning notice.\n\nE. The magistrate court or metropolitan court in the county where the alleged violation occurred has jurisdiction for any case arising from a penalty assessment under the Criminal Code.\n\nF. A penalty assessment citation issued by a law enforcement officer shall be submitted to the appropriate magistrate court or metropolitan court within five business days of issuance. If the citation is not submitted within three business days, it may be dismissed with prejudice.\n\nG. A citation with a written promise to appear in court or to pay the penalty assessment is a summons. If a person fails to appear or to pay the penalty assessment by the appearance date, a warrant for failure to appear may be issued.\n\nH. A written promise to appear in court may be complied with by appearance of counsel.\n\nI. When a person issued a penalty assessment elects to appear in court rather than to pay the penalty assessment to the court, no fine imposed upon later conviction shall exceed the penalty assessment established for the particular penalty assessment. A person who elects to appear in court shall pay the costs required by law to be collected by magistrate or metropolitan court judges.\n\nJ. Penalty assessments collected by a magistrate court or metropolitan court pursuant to this section shall be transferred to the administrative office of the courts for credit to the magistrate drug court fund.\n\nHistory:Laws 2019, ch. 217, § 3.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2019, ch. 217, § 5 made Laws 2019, ch. 217 effective July 1, 2019.\n\nTemporary provisions.Laws 2019, ch. 217, § 4 provided that the New Mexico compilation commission shall compile Section 3 [31-19A-1 NMSA 1978] of this act in a new article of Chapter 31 NMSA 1978.",
