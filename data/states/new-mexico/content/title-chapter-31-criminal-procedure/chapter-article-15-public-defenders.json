Each district public defender shall be an attorney licensed to practice law in the highest courts of this state and a resident of this state.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-22A-9, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 156, § 9.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 1973, ch. 156, § 13, provided for the limitation of the chief public defender to designated districts and to appoint district public defenders during the sixty-second fiscal year to establish pilot programs.",

      "text": "A. Under the supervision and control of the chief, each district public defender shall administer the operation of the department office within his district.\n\nB. The district public defender or the chief may authorize the representation of a person who is without counsel and who is financially unable to obtain counsel when that person is under investigation for allegedly committing murder or any other felony criminal offense.\n\nC. The district public defender shall represent every person without counsel who is financially unable to obtain counsel and who is charged in any court within the district with any crime that carries a possible sentence of imprisonment. The representation shall begin not later than the time of the initial appearance of the person before any court and shall continue throughout all stages of the proceedings against him, including any appeal, as directed by the chief.\n\nD. The district public defender shall represent any person within the district who is without counsel and who is financially unable to obtain counsel in any state postconviction proceeding.\n\nE. The district public defender shall notify the chief if, for any reason, he is unable to represent a person entitled to his representation, and the chief shall make provision for representation.\n\nF. The district public defender may confer with any person who is not represented by counsel and who is being forcibly detained.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-22A-10, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 156, § 10; 2001, ch. 34, § 2.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, inserted Subsection B and redesignated the remaining subsections accordingly.\n\nNo per se conflict of interestexists when post conviction conflict division of public defender department represents individual arguing ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney from department's trial division, but each potential conflict must be reviewed on case-by-case basis, and individual may waive any such conflict by knowingly and intelligently signing waiver after proper advisement.Morales v. Bridgforth, 2004-NMSC-034, 136 N.M. 511, 100 P.3d 668.\n\nConstruction with Indigent Defense Act.— The legislature, understanding that courts determine indigence under the Indigent Defense Act (IDA), enacted this section of the Public Defender Act (PDA) intending \"every person without counsel who is financially unable to obtain counsel\" to include all persons who courts determine are \"needy\" under the IDA. Therefore, under the administrative system of the PDA and IDA, when a court determines that a defendant is \"needy,\" the defendant is \"financially unable to obtain counsel\" under the PDA, and thedDepartment \"shall represent\" the defendant pursuant to this section, assuming the defendant is charged with a crime carrying a possible sentence of imprisonment.State ex rel. Quintana v. Schnedar, 1993-NMSC-033, 115 N.M. 573, 855 P.2d 562.\n\nStandards for determining indigency.— The Indigent Defense Act and the Public Defender Act are consistent as amended: The IDA obligates courts to determine indigence, the PDA directs the department to adopt standards for determining indigence, and other statutes instruct courts to employ those standards.State ex rel. Quintana v. Schnedar, 1993-NMSC-033, 115 N.M. 573, 855 P.2d 562.\n\nJudicial procedure upon claim of conflict of interest by public defender.— If a conflict of interest or other disqualification is claimed to exist under Subsection D (now Subsection E), the court shall: (1) determine whether a conflict of interest or other disqualification of the office of public defender in fact exists, (2) determine whether the conflict or disqualification is local or statewide, (3) if the conflict or disqualification is local, direct the chief public defender to provide a staff attorney or contract attorney from another county or district to represent the indigent, and (4) if the conflict or disqualification extends beyond the county or district, then the court may appoint counsel for the indigent defendant.Richards v. Patton, 1985-NMSC-059, 103 N.M. 14, 702 P.2d 4.\n\nNo statutory right to counsel in grand jury proceedings.— Neither the Grand Jury Act nor the Public Defender Act provides a target witness testifying before a grand jury with a right to counsel such that an indictment must be dismissed if counsel is not present and there is no express voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of counsel's presence.State v. Tisthammer, 1998-NMCA-115, 126 N.M. 52, 966 P.2d 760, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 107, 967 P.2d 447.\n\nNo blanket authorization to confer with all forcibly detained indigents.— Subsection E (now Subsection F) is not a blanket authorization to confer with all indigent persons who are forcibly detained, but rather authorizes the public defender to confer with a person detained only (1) when that person has evinced a desire to consult with an attorney or have one present during questioning in response to Miranda warnings and law enforcement personnel have asked the defender to do so; (2) when the defender is conducting inquiries into whether the initial appearance has been unnecessarily delayed or attempting to have the person detained brought before the court for such an appearance, and the district court has authorized him to do so; (3) when authorized or directed in other circumstances by a district judge or (4) when defending a criminal charge following the initial appearance.State v. Rascon, 1976-NMSC-016, 89 N.M. 254, 550 P.2d 266.\n\nInformation obtained by district public defender's staff must be imputed to him.State v. Valdez, 1980-NMSC-098, 95 N.M. 70, 618 P.2d 1234.\n\nMunicipality not required to provide representation.— Although a defendant is entitled to be represented by counsel on the appeal of his conviction to the court of appeals, a municipality is not required to provide for such legal representation because the legislature has set forth a comprehensive plan to furnish counsel to qualified criminal defendants and municipal budgetary restrictions preclude expenditures for items not budgeted. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-04.\n\nDuty to represent indigents in metropolitan court.— The public defender department's scope of representation is limited statutorily to the magistrate and district courts; the legislature has designated the Albuquerque metropolitan court as a magistrate court. Therefore, the public defender department is obligated to represent all indigents in the Albuquerque metropolitan court who are charged with any violation that carries a possible penalty of imprisonment, including city code violations. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-43.\n\nChildren allowed counsel prior to court appearance.— Subsection E (now Subsection F) can be used to provide children in detention with counsel at a stage prior to any court appearance and therefore before an attorney can be appointed. 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-58.\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico law relating to evidence, see 12 N.M.L. Rev. 379 (1982).",

For the purposes of the exempt salaries plan prepared pursuant to Section 10-9-5 NMSA 1978, each district public defender shall be considered an assistant in the offices of the chief.\n\nB. All employees of the department other than the chief, assistant chief public defenders, appellate defender and district public defenders shall be subject to the provisions of the Personnel Act [Chapter 10, Article 9 NMSA 1978], unless the employees are exempted from the Personnel Act by the commission.\n\nC. Before the commission may exempt the department from the Personnel Act, the commission shall develop and adopt personnel policies for the department; provided that no employee of the department, except the chief, assistant chief public defenders, appellate defender and district public defenders, shall have fewer rights under these policies than under the Personnel Act and under administrative rules applicable to state employees on the effective date of this 2014 act.\n\nD. No chief, assistant chief public defender, appellate defender, district public defender or attorney hired on a full-time basis as an assistant to the chief or to a district public defender, while holding that office or employed in that capacity, shall engage in the private practice of law.

If any person charged with any crime or a delinquent act that carries a possible sentence of imprisonment appears in any court without counsel, the judge shall inform the person of the person's right:\n\n(1) to confer with the district public defender; and\n\n(2) if the person is financially unable to obtain counsel, to be represented by the district public defender at all stages of the proceedings against the person.\n\nB. Following notification of any person under Subsection A of this section, the judge shall notify the district public defender and continue the proceedings until the person has applied with the district public defender.\n\nC. A person shall pay a nonrefundable application fee of ten dollars ($10.00) at the time the person applies with the public defender for representation. The fee shall be deposited in the public defender automation fund. The public defender shall determine if the person is indigent and unable to pay the fee, subject to review by the court. When the person remains in custody and is unable to pay the fee, the court may waive payment of the fee. A child subject to the provisions of the Delinquency Act [Chapter 32A, Article 2 NMSA 1978] shall not be required to pay the application fee.\n\nD. Peace officers shall notify the district public defender of any person not represented by counsel who is being forcibly detained and who is charged with, or under suspicion of, the commission of any crime that carries a possible sentence of imprisonment, unless the person has previously appeared in court upon that charge.\n\nE. Any person entitled to representation by the district public defender may intelligently waive the right to representation. The waiver may be for all or any part of the proceedings. The waiver shall be in writing and countersigned by a district public defender.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-22A-12, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 156, § 12; 1993, ch. 79, § 1; 2021, ch. 15, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For explanation of rights, opportunity to call attorney,seeRule 6-501A NMRA.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective June 18, 2021, eliminated, for children subject to the provisions of the Delinquency Act, the application fee for applying for representation with the public defender, and made technical, nonsubstantive changes; and in Subsection C, after \"the court may waive payment of the fee\", added \"A child subject to the provisions of the Delinquency Act shall not be required to pay the application fee.\"\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, inserted \"application fee; indigency determination\" in the catchline; inserted \"or a delinquent act\" in the introductory paragraph of Subsection A; substituted \"applied\" for \"conferred\" near the end of Subsection B; added present Subsection C; redesignated former Subsections C and D as present Subsections D and E; and substituted \"shall\" for \"must\" in the second sentence of Subsection D.\n\nImport of Subsection B.— Inasmuch as the benefits of the Public Defender Act accrue only to those who are \"financially unable to obtain counsel\" and who are charged with certain crimes, obviously a determination of indigency is required. Inquiry into this feature is accomplished by the court, and the public defender is assigned to the case where indigency appears.State v. Rascon, 1976-NMSC-016, 89 N.M. 254, 550 P.2d 266.\n\nDefendant must make showing of indigence.— Although trial court failed to advise pro se defendant of his rights under the public defender laws, such failure was harmless error where defendant made no showing of indigence, but instead chose to represent himself, even after trial judge notified him of his constitutional right to counsel.Attorney General v. Montoya, 1998-NMCA-149, 126 N.M. 273, 968 P.2d 784, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 532, 972 P.2d 351.\n\nPurpose of Subsection D.— Subsection D does not expand upon or extend the constitutional rights of a person forcibly detained, under the constitutions of the United States or New Mexico. Rather, its prime purpose is to protect and implement the right of persons detained to be brought before a court without unnecessary delay.State v. Rascon, 1976-NMSC-016, 89 N.M. 254, 550 P.2d 266.\n\nPublic defender to make inquiries about forcibly detained persons.— Subsection D is intended to advise the public defender of the names and whereabouts of persons who are being forcibly detained so that if they are not brought before a court for an initial appearance without unnecessary delay, the public defender may make inquiries, with demands upon the state to bring forth the prisoner if appropriate and with application to a court if necessary.State v. Rascon, 1976-NMSC-016, 89 N.M. 254, 550 P.2d 266.\n\nFailure of police to comply with Subsection Ddid not infringe upon defendant's rights against self-incrimination where defendant was advised of those rights both at time of arrest and booking, voluntarily acknowledged that he understood them and signed waiver of rights form.State v. Rascon, 1976-NMSC-016, 89 N.M. 254, 550 P.2d 266.\n\nCounsel need not be notified before defendant questioned about unrelated offense.— Where an accused has been charged with one offense and is represented by counsel with respect to that offense, police need not notify that counsel before questioning defendant about another unrelated offense.State v. Seward, 1986-NMCA-062, 104 N.M. 548, 724 P.2d 756, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 522, 724 P.2d 231.\n\nLack of a countersignature on defendant's waiver of counsel formdoes not of itself make that waiver invalid for the purpose of enhancing later convictions.State v. Pino, 1997-NMCA-001, 122 N.M. 789, 932 P.2d 13, cert. denied, 122 N.M. 589, 929 P.2d 981.\n\nNo waiver where defendant was unaware of possibility of jail.— There was no voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of counsel where the defendant, who pled guilty, was not advised, and was not aware, of the possibility of jail when he waived his right to an attorney.Smith v. Maldonado, 1985-NMSC-115, 103 N.M. 570, 711 P.2d 15.\n\nLack of countersignature not considered on appeal.— The fact that defendant's waiver form was not countersigned by a district public defender as required by Subsection E was not raised below nor briefed and supported by authority on appeal, and would not be considered by the appellate court.State v. Ramirez, 1976-NMCA-101, 89 N.M. 635, 556 P.2d 43,overruled on other grounds byCity of Albuquerque v. Haywood, 1998-NMCA-029, 124 N.M. 661, 954 P.2d 93, cert. denied, 124 N.M. 589, 953 P.2d 1087.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Fathers Behind Bars: The Right to Counsel in Civil Contempt Proceedings,\" see 14 N.M.L.
