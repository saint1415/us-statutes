      "text": "Whenever it appears that there is a question as to the defendant's competency to proceed in a criminal case, any further proceeding in the cause shall be suspended until the issue is determined. Unless the case is dismissed upon motion of a party, when the question is raised in a court other than the district court or a metropolitan court, the proceeding shall be suspended and the cause transferred to the district court. If the question of a defendant's competency is raised in the metropolitan court and the court determines that the defendant is incompetent to proceed in a criminal case, the cause, if not dismissed upon motion of a party, shall be transferred to the district court.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 31-9-1, enacted by Laws 1988, ch. 107, § 1 and by 1988, ch. 108, § 1; 1989, ch. 94, § 1; 1993, ch. 240, § 1; 1993, ch. 249, § 1.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1988, ch. 108, § 1 and Laws 1988, ch. 107, § 1, both approved March 8, 1988, repealed former 31-9-1 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1987, ch. 353, § 1, and enacted identical new sections designated 31-9-1 NMSA 1978, effective May 18, 1988.\n\nCross references.— For the interstate compact on mentally disordered offenders,see31-5-10, 31-5-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor commitment of the mentally ill,see43-1-2 to 43-1-23 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor rule of criminal procedure governing defenses of insanity, incompetency, and lack of capacity,seeRule 5-602 NMRA.\n\n1993 amendments.— Identical amendments to this section were enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 240, § 1 and Laws 1993, ch. 249 § 1, both approved on April 6, 1993, and both effective June 18, 1993, which inserted \"to proceed in a criminal case\" in the first sentence, substituted \"Unless the case is dismissed upon motion of a party, when\" for \"If\" at the beginning of the second sentence and added the third sentence. The section is set out above as amended by Laws 1993, ch. 249, § 1.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective July 1, 1989, inserted \"or a metropolitan court\" in the second sentence.\n\nIncompetency is distinct from insanity.— A claim of incompetency to stand trial is distinct from the defense of insanity. The competency issue is whether a defendant understands the nature and significance of the proceedings, has a factual understanding of the charges, and is able to assist defense counsel in defendant's defense. The insanity defense concerns a defendant's mental state at the time the offense was committed.State v. Najar, 1986-NMCA-068, 104 N.M. 540, 724 P.2d 249, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 460, 722 P.2d 1182.\n\nFailure to determine competency.— Where defense counsel raised the issue of defendant's competency at defendant's preliminary hearing in magistrate court; the case was then transferred to district court; the district court ordered a competency evaluation of defendant; based on the results of the evaluation, defense counsel was satisfied that defendant was competent to stand trial, and the court entered an order finding defendant competent to stand trial; defense counsel again raised the issue of defendant's competency on the day of trial, prior to the start of trial; the court took no action and proceeded to trial; during the trial, defendant made noises, talking to someone who was not present in the courtroom; the court admonished defendant not to disrupt the trial; defense counsel attempted, but the court refused, to allow defense counsel to raise the issue of defendant's competency; the jury returned a verdict of guilty; defense counsel again raised the issue of defendant's competency; the court then permitted defense counsel to fully raise the issue and instructed defense counsel to request a competency evaluation; based on the evaluation, the court found defendant to be incompetent, but declined to dismiss the charges and proceeded to sentence defendant, defendant was denied due process of law because the court erred when it refused to permit defense counsel to raise the issue of defendant's competency prior to and during trial, when it failed to stay the proceedings pending a determination of whether a reasonable doubt existed as to defendant's competency to stand trial, and after finding defendant incompetent.State v. Montoya, 2010-NMCA-067, 148 N.M. 495, 238 P.3d 369, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-006, 148 N.M. 582, 241 P.3d 180.\n\nRequirements on court.— Whenever a legitimate concern about the present ability of a defendant to consult and understand is brought to the court's attention, the court is required to consider whatever competency-related evidence is before the court and to determine whether there exists a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's competency to stand trial. If the court determines that there is reasonable doubt as to defendant's competency, the court must have defendant's competency professionally evaluated by a qualified professional who must submit a report to the court.State v. Flores, 2005-NMCA-135, 138 N.M. 636, 124 P.3d 1175, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-011, 138 N.M. 586, 124 P.3d 564.\n\nIn considering whether reasonable doubt exists,the court must keep in mind the requirement that defendant must have sufficient present ability to consult and understand as required under due process of law.State v. Flores, 2005-NMCA-135, 138 N.M. 636, 124 P.3d 1175, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-011, 138 N.M. 586, 124 P.3d 564.\n\nConstitutionality.— This article did not deprive an incompetent criminal defendant of equal protection under the law, or of substantive or procedural due process.State v. Rotherham, 1996-NMSC-048, 122 N.M. 246, 923 P.2d 1131.\n\nMulti-step competency proceeding.— The New Mexico statutory scheme provides for a multi-step competency proceeding when it appears that there is a question as to a defendant's competency.State v. Webb, 1990-NMCA-077, 111 N.M. 78, 801 P.2d 660, cert. quashed, 111 N.M. 164, 803 P.2d 253.\n\nDue process requires incompetent defendants to be treated differently.The conviction of an accused person while that person is legally incompetent violates due process, and thus incompetent defendants cannot be brought to trial in the same manner as competent defendants.State v. Gallegos, 1990-NMCA-104, 111 N.M. 110, 802 P.2d 15, cert denied, 111 N.M. 77, 801 P.2d 659.\n\nDefendant cannot be validly tried while mentally incompetentto stand trial.State v. Tartaglia, 1969-NMCA-110, 80 N.M. 788, 461 P.2d 921.\n\nEffect of false claim of lack of competency.— Where the file and records conclusively establish that his claim of lack of competency to stand trial was false, defendant was not entitled to a hearing on the claim.State v. Kenney, 1970-NMCA-038, 81 N.M. 368, 467 P.2d 34.\n\nSection provides for questioning of competency prior to suspension.— This section provides that there must be a \"question\" as to the mental competency of a defendant to stand trial, before the court is required to suspend proceedings in the cause until the issue as to defendant's competency is determined.State v. Smith, 1969-NMCA-101, 80 N.M. 742, 461 P.2d 157.\n\nQuestion of competency requires more than mere assertion.— This section requires there to be a \"question\" as to the accused's capacity to stand trial. The \"question\" is not raised by an assertion of that issue, even though the assertion is in good faith. As in the similar federal statute, there must be a showing of reasonable cause for the belief that an accused is not competent to stand trial.State v. Hollowell, 1969-NMCA-105, 80 N.M. 756, 461 P.2d 238.\n\nCounsel's impressions of defendant's mental state insufficient.— \"Wondering\" about defendant's mental capacity which is based solely on counsel's impression is not reasonable cause for a belief that defendant is incompetent to stand trial.State v. Hovey, 1969-NMCA-049, 80 N.M. 373, 456 P.2d 206.\n\nWhen court justified in proceeding without competency hearing.— Defense counsel's representations to the trial court that the defendant was competent to plead guilty and responsible for his actions effectively removed any question of competency from the case and justified court in proceeding without competency hearing, despite previously ordered psychiatric examination of defendant.State v. Bius, 1973-NMCA-057, 85 N.M. 98, 509 P.2d 573.\n\nMotion must include grounds for belief of lack of capacity.— A motion on behalf of an accused for a judicial determination of mental competency to stand trial shall set forth the ground for belief that such mental capacity is lacking. When the motion does not set forth grounds for reasonable cause to believe the defendant may be insane or mentally incompetent, the motion can be denied. \"The statute requires such an examination only when it is shown that there is reasonable cause to believe that an accused may be presently insane or otherwise mentally incompetent.\"State v. Hovey, 1969-NMCA-049, 80 N.M. 373, 456 P.2d 206.\n\nCourt not required to grant motion for examination.— An examination is not necessary, nor is the court required to grant a motion seeking such examination unless there is a question as to the mental capacity of defendant.State v. Morales, 1970-NMCA-036, 81 N.M. 333, 466 P.2d 899, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 305, 466 P.2d 871, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 842, 91 S. Ct. 84, 27 L. Ed. 2d 77.\n\nPossible prejudicial statement of expert not grounds for error.— Statement of medical expert that defendant had no mental disease either at the time of the commission of the criminal act or at the time of trial when the reason for testimony concerning defendant's mental condition at the time of trial was because the medical expert's examination had been primarily to determine defendant's present competency to stand trial found not to be error although possibly prejudicial.State v. Lopez, 1969-NMCA-057, 80 N.M. 599, 458 P.2d 851, cert. denied, 80 N.M. 607, 458 P.2d 859, cert. denied, 398 U.S. 942, 90 S. Ct. 1860, 26 L. Ed. 2d 279 (1970).\n\nTrial court's failure to determine competency not error.— Where defendant's claim is that the trial court erred in failing to judicially determine his mental competency and the context of this contention is that the motion was never called to the court's attention and no ruling was invoked; although, prior opinions indicate that an issue as to defendant's mental competency may still be litigated, still they do not support the view that a trial court errs in failing to decide an issue on which a ruling has not been invoked.State v. Madrigal, 1973-NMCA-116, 85 N.M. 496, 513 P.2d 1278, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 483, 513 P.2d 1265.\n\nInitial orders were not final orders subject to appellate review.— Where the trial court had made only the initial orders in a multi-part proceeding to determine defendant's competency to stand trial for murder, the orders finding defendant dangerous and incompetent to stand trial from which he appealed were not final orders subject to appellate review.State v. Webb, 1990-NMCA-077, 111 N.M. 78, 801 P.2d 660, cert. quashed, 111 N.M. 164, 803 P.2d 253.\n\nCompetency of defendants in courts of limited jurisdiction.— Except for metropolitan courts, courts of limited jurisdiction have no authority to hold competency hearings. 2003 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 03-04.\n\nCourts of limited jurisdiction have no authority to commit defendants to a mental health facility. 2003 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 03-04.\n\nAm.

      "text": "A. When, after hearing, a court determines that a defendant is not competent to proceed in a criminal case and the court does not find that the defendant is dangerous, the court may dismiss the criminal case without prejudice in the interests of justice. Upon dismissal, the court may advise the district attorney to consider initiation of proceedings under the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code [43-1-1 NMSA 1978] and order the defendant confined for a maximum of seven days to facilitate preparation and initiation of a petition pursuant to that code.\n\nB. When a district court determines that a defendant charged with a felony is incompetent to proceed in the criminal case, but does not dismiss the criminal case, and the district court at that time makes a specific finding that the defendant is dangerous, the district court may commit the defendant as provided in this section for treatment to attain competency to proceed in a criminal case. The court shall enter an appropriate transport order that also provides for return of the defendant to the local facilities of the court upon completion of the treatment. The defendant so committed shall be provided with treatment available to involuntarily committed persons, and:\n\n(1) the defendant shall be detained by the department of health in a secure, locked facility; and\n\n(2) the defendant, during the period of commitment, shall not be released from that secure facility except pursuant to an order of the district court that committed him.\n\nC. Within thirty days of receipt of the court's order of commitment of an incompetent defendant and of the necessary and available documents reasonably required for admission pursuant to written policies adopted by the secretary of health or his designee, the defendant shall be admitted to a facility designated for the treatment of defendants who are incompetent to stand trial and dangerous. If, after conducting an investigation, the secretary determines that the department of health does not have the ability to meet the medical needs of a defendant ordered committed to a facility, the secretary or his designee may refuse admission to the defendant upon written certification to the committing court and the parties of the lack of ability to meet the medical needs of the defendant. The certification must be made within fourteen days of the receipt of the court's order of commitment and necessary and available documents reasonably required for admission pursuant to written policies adopted by the secretary or his designee. Within ten days of filing of the certification the court shall conduct a hearing for further disposition of the criminal case.\n\nD. As used in Sections 31-9-1 through 31-9-1.5 NMSA 1978, \"dangerous\" means that, if released, the defendant presents a serious threat of inflicting great bodily harm on another or of violating Section 30-9-11 or 30-9-13 NMSA 1978.\n\nE. Within thirty days of an incompetent defendant's admission to a facility to undergo treatment to attain competency to proceed in a criminal case, the person supervising the defendant's treatment shall file with the district court, the state and the defense an initial assessment and treatment plan and a report on the defendant's amenability to treatment to render him competent to proceed in a criminal case, an assessment of the facility's or program's capacity to provide appropriate treatment for the defendant and an opinion as to the probability of the defendant's attaining competency within a period of nine months from the date of the original finding of incompetency to proceed in a criminal case.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 31-9-1.2, enacted by Laws 1988, ch. 107, § 3 and by Laws 1988, ch. 108, § 3; 1993, ch. 240, § 3; 1993, ch. 249, § 3; 1999, ch. 149, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For rule of criminal procedure governing defenses of insanity, incompetency, and lack of capacity,seeRule 5-602 NMRA.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, added \"and order the defendant confined for a maximum of seven days to facilitate preparation and initiation of a petition pursuant to that code\" at the end of Subsection A; in Subsection B, inserted \"charged with a felony\" following \"a defendant\", substituted \"proceed in the criminal case\" for \"stand trial\", substituted \"commit the defendant as provided in this section for\" for \"order\", and deleted \"for a period not to exceed one year\" following \"in a criminal case\" in the first sentence; added Subsection C and redesignated the remaining subsections accordingly; and substituted \"nine months\" for \"one year\" in Subsection E.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, rewrote the section to the extent that a detailed comparison was impracticable. This section was also amended by Laws 1993, ch. 240, § 3, effective June 18, 1993. The section was set out as amended by Laws 1993, ch. 249, § 3.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nRules of evidence apply to dangerousness hearings.— Where defendant was charged by criminal information with battery upon a peace officer and assault upon a peace officer, and where, while released from jail on the condition that she report to pretrial services, defendant was re-arrested and charged with another count of battery upon a peace officer, and where the state moved to revoke defendant's conditions of release based on the new charge and the failure to comply with conditions of release, and where the district court amended the conditions of release but denied the motion to revoke, and where, pending trial, defendant moved for, and was granted, a competency evaluation to determine if she was competent to stand trial, and where, upon completion and receipt of defendant's competency evaluation, the district court found defendant incompetent to proceed to trial, and where the state filed a notice of intent to raise dangerousness, and where, prior to the dangerousness hearing, defendant was charged in a third case with two counts of indecent exposure, and where, at the dangerousness hearing, the state attempted to introduce into evidence copies of defendant's three criminal complaints and a printout of defendant's criminal history, and where defendant objected to the use of the state's exhibits, claiming that the criminal complaints constituted hearsay with no foundation in sworn testimony and that their introduction would violate the New Mexico Rules of Evidence, and where the state argued that the Rules of Evidence did not apply to competency or dangerousness hearings, the district court did not err excluding the state's proposed evidence and finding that the New Mexico Rules of Evidence apply to all criminal proceedings under Rule 11-1101(B) NMRA, because under the plain language of Rule 11-1101(B), the Rules of Evidence apply unless a dangerousness hearing falls into one of the listed exceptions, and the plain language of the exceptions listed in Rule 11-1101(D) do not include a dangerousness hearing under NMSA 1978, § 31-9-1.2 or Rule 5-602.2 NMRA.State v. Archuleta, 2023-NMCA-077, cert. denied.\n\nIn considering whether reasonable doubt exists,the court must keep in mind the requirement that a defendant must have sufficient present ability to consult and understand as required under due process of law.State v. Flores, 2005-NMCA-135, 138 N.M. 636, 124 P.3d 1175, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-011, 138 N.M. 586, 124 P.3d 564.\n\nDefense counsel's observations and opinions.— A court may consider defense counsel's observations and opinions, but those observations and opinions alone cannot trigger reasonable doubts about defendant's competency.State v. Flores, 2005-NMCA-135, 138 N.M. 636, 124 P.3d 1175, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-011, 138 N.M. 586, 124 P.3d 564.\n\nFinding of dangerousness as prerequisite to detention.— In the context of the competency statutes, the finding of dangerousness is a prerequisite to the applicability of the portions of the statute allowing defendant to be detained for a longer period of time. Thus, the court must make a finding of dangerousness prior to the detention authorized by Section 31-9-1.5 NMSA 1978, but it need not have made such a finding at a prior hearing.State v. Gallegos, 1990-NMCA-104, 111 N.M. 110, 802 P.2d 15, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 77, 801 P.2d 659.\n\nSufficient evidence supported the district court's conclusion that the state did not meet its burden to establish dangerousness.— Where defendant's competency became an issue after she was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, and use of a telephone to harass, threaten, annoy, or offend, and where the state filed a motion for a hearing to determine dangerousness, setting forth facts supporting the current charges and listing five other unrelated charges that had been dismissed for various reasons, substantial evidence supported the district court's decision that the state did not meets its burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that defendant was currently dangerous where the evidence established that defendant fired a rifle but did not intend to shoot the alleged victims, the state never established, or even suggested, in its motion for a dangerousness determination that the prior dismissed charges were relevant or supported a conclusion that defendant was currently dangerous, the state did not present any evidence concerning defendant's current mental state, and medical testimony established that defendant's behavior was amenable to treatment by prescriptions and by other counseling and therapy.State v. Holbert, 2024-NMCA-069.\n\nThe district court erred in dismissing the case with prejudice.— Where defendant's competency became an issue after she was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, and use of a telephone to harass, threaten, annoy, or offend, and where, after a forensic evaluation, the district court dismissed the criminal information with prejudice after a finding that defendant was incompetent to stand trial but was not dangerous, it was error for the court to dismiss the case with prejudice, because dismissal under 31-9-1.2(A) NMSA 1978 is permitted only if it is without prejudice.State v. Holbert, 2024-NMCA-069.",

Within ninety days of the entry of the order committing an incompetent defendant to undergo treatment, the district court, sitting without a jury, shall conduct a hearing, unless waived by the defense, and shall determine:\n\n(1) whether the defendant is competent to proceed in the criminal case; and, if not,\n\n(2) whether the defendant is making progress under treatment toward attainment of competency within nine months from the date of the original finding of incompetency; and\n\n(3) whether the defendant remains dangerous as that term is defined in Section 31-9-1.2 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. At least seven days prior to the review hearing, the treatment supervisor shall submit a written progress report to the court, the state and the defense indicating:\n\n(1) the clinical findings of the treatment supervisor and the facts upon which the findings are based;\n\n(2) the opinion of the treatment supervisor as to whether the defendant has attained competency or as to whether the defendant is making progress under treatment toward attaining competency within nine months from the date of the original finding of incompetency and whether there is a substantial probability that the defendant will attain competency within nine months from the date of the original finding of incompetency;\n\n(3) whether the defendant is dangerous as that term is defined in Section 31-9-1.2 NMSA 1978 or whether the defendant satisfies the criteria for involuntary commitment contained in the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code [43-1-2 NMSA 1978]; and\n\n(4) if the defendant is receiving medication, information from the prescribing physician indicating the type, the dosage and the effect of the medication on the defendant's appearance, actions and demeanor.\n\nC. If the district court finds the defendant to be competent, the district court shall set the matter for trial, provided that if the defendant is in need of continued care or treatment and the supervisor of the defendant's treatment agrees to continue to provide it, the district court may enter any order it deems appropriate for the continued care or treatment of the defendant by the facility or program pending the conclusion of the criminal proceedings.\n\nD. If the district court finds that the defendant is still not competent to proceed in a criminal case but that he is making progress toward attaining competency, the district court may continue or modify its original treatment order entered pursuant to Section 31-9-1.2 NMSA 1978, provided that:\n\n(1) the question of the defendant's competency shall be reviewed again not later than nine months from the original determination of incompetency to proceed in a criminal case; and\n\n(2) the treatment supervisor shall submit a written progress report as specified in Subsection B of this section at least seven days prior to such hearing.\n\nE. If the district court finds that the defendant is still not competent, that he is not making progress toward attaining competency and that there is not a substantial probability that he will attain competency within nine months from the date of the original finding of incompetency, the district court shall proceed pursuant to Section 31-9-1.4 NMSA 1978. However, if the defendant is in need of continued care and treatment and the supervisor of the defendant's treatment agrees to continue to provide it, the district court may enter any order it deems appropriate for the continued care or treatment by the facility or program pending the conclusion of the proceedings.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 31-9-1.3, enacted by Laws 1988, ch. 107, § 4 and by Laws 1988, ch. 108, § 4; 1993, ch. 240, § 4; 1993, ch. 249, § 4; 1999, ch. 149, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For rule of criminal procedure governing defenses of insanity, incompetency, and lack of capacity,seeRule 5-602 NMRA.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, substituted \"nine months\" for \"one year\" throughout the section; substituted \"proceed in the criminal case\" for \"stand trial or to plead\" in Subsection A(1); added Subsection A(3); added \"whether there is a substantial probability that the defendant will attain competency within nine months from the date of the original finding of incompetency\" in Subsection B(2); and added Subsection B(3), redesignating the remaining subsections accordingly.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, inserted \"district\" preceding \"court\" throughout the section; inserted \"to proceed in a criminal case\" in the introductory paragraph of Subsection D, and substituted \"original determination of incompetency to proceed in a criminal case\" for \"first review hearing\" in Subsection D(1).

The section was set out as amended by Laws 1993, ch. 249, § 6.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nFelonies involving great bodily harm.— Subsection D of Section 31-9-1.5 NMSA 1978 allows the criminal commitment of a defendant who commits a felony in a manner that results in great bodily harm to another person and is not limited only to felonies that contain the infliction of great bodily harm as an element necessary for conviction.State v. Lopez, 2011-NMCA-071, 150 N.M. 14, 256 P.3d 977, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.\n\nRobbery.— Where, at a commitment hearing, the parties stipulated that defendant approached an employee of a hotel in the hotel laundry room, struck the employee in the face with a closed fist, beat the employee over the head with a hard plastic tube, took the keys to the hotel office, and took money from the hotel cash drawer; and the court found that defendant had committed armed robbery that resulted in great bodily harm to the victim, the court did not err in ordering defendant's commitment.State v. Lopez, 2011-NMCA-071, 150 N.M. 14, 256 P.3d 977, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.\n\nStandard of proof.— The appropriate standards of proof for the initial determination as well as the redetermination of competency is a preponderance of the evidence.State v. Chavez, 2008-NMSC-001, 143 N.M. 205, 174 P.3d 988.\n\nCredit for presentence confinement.— Presentence confinement credit should be credited to criminal commitment under Subsection D of Section 31-9-1.5 NMSA 1978 to the same extent the confinement would have been credited against a sentence for a criminal conviction.State v. Lopez, 2011-NMCA-071, 150 N.M. 14, 256 P.3d 977, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.\n\nWhere, before trial, the court found that defendant was incompetent to proceed to trial and that defendant had committed robbery that resulted in great bodily harm to another person and the court committed defendant to twelve years, defendant was entitled to presentence confinement credit toward the commitment period.State v. Lopez, 2011-NMCA-071, 150 N.M. 14, 256 P.3d 977, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.\n\nCredit for pre-conviction confinement.— To the extent that defendant's pre-conviction confinement would have been credited against defendant's sentence had defendant been convicted of a crime, defendant's pre-conviction confinement must be credited against the term of defendant's criminal commitment.State v. Lopez, 2009-NMCA-112, 147 N.M. 279, 219 P.3d 1288, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-009, 147 N.M. 421, 224 P.3d 648.\n\nWhere defendant was committed for treatment to attain competency to stand trial for a period of two years and two months before defendant was committed for a third-degree felony offense of aggravated battery against a household member, the period of defendant's pre-conviction confinement should have been credited to the term of defendant's criminal commitment.State v. Lopez, 2009-NMCA-112, 147 N.M. 279, 219 P.3d 1288, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-009, 147 N.M. 421, 224 P.3d 648.\n\nThis section does not violate any constitutional guarantee.State v. Adonis, 2008-NMSC-059, 145 N.M. 102, 194 P.3d 717.\n\nJurisdiction of an appeal of a lifetime criminal commitment lies with the supreme court.— Where defendant was charged with an open count of murder, and where the district court found by clear and convincing evidence that defendant committed first-degree murder, determined that defendant was dangerous and not competent to stand trial, and ordered that defendant be detained for life by the New Mexico department of health pursuant to 31-9-1.5(D) NMSA 1978, jurisdiction of defendant's appeal properly lied in the New Mexico supreme court, because commitment pursuant to 31-9-1.5 NMSA 1978 results in a loss of liberty, and the deprivation of liberty resulting from a lifetime criminal commitment is equivalent to the deprivation of liberty under a lifetime criminal sentence, and N.M. Const. Art. VI, § 2 confers jurisdiction on the New Mexico supreme court for cases imposing a sentence of life imprisonment.State v. Baca, 2019-NMSC-014.\n\nSufficient evidence of willful and deliberate murder.— Where defendant was charged with an open count of murder for killing his father with a pickaxe, and where the district court found by clear and convincing evidence that defendant committed first-degree murder, determined that defendant was dangerous and not competent to stand trial, and ordered that defendant be detained for life by the New Mexico department of health pursuant to 31-9-1.5(D) NMSA 1978, and where defendant conceded that he killed his father, evidence that the killing involved a prolonged, sustained attack and defendant's statements and actions before, during, and after the killing, including arming himself with the pickaxe, was sufficient to establish that the murder was willful, deliberate, and premeditated.State v. Baca, 2019-NMSC-014.\n\nThe basic sentences for misdemeanor crimescannot be used to calculate the term of commitment under Subsection D of this section.State v. Demongey, 2008-NMCA-066, 144 N.M. 333, 187 P.3d 679, cert. quashed, 2011-NMCERT-001, 150 N.M. 560, 263 P.3d 902.\n\nRedetermination of competency.— The proper standard of proof for a redetermination of the competency of a defendant to stand trial, following a prior determination that the defendant is incompetent to stand trial, is a preponderance of the evidence.State v. Chavez, 2008-NMSC-001, 143 N.M. 205, 174 P.3d 988.\n\nGenerally.— Commitment pursuant to this section is not punishment.State v. Spriggs-Gore, 2003-NMCA-046, 133 N.M. 479, 64 P.3d 506, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 539, 65 P.3d 1094.\n\nConstitutionality.— This section does not unconstitutionally deprive defendants of due process.State v. Spriggs-Gore, 2003-NMCA-046, 133 N.M. 479, 64 P.3d 506, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 539, 65 P.3d 1094.\n\nThis section does not abrogate a defendant's constitutional rights.State v. Spriggs-Gore, 2003-NMCA-046, 133 N.M. 479, 64 P.3d 506, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 539, 65 P.3d 1094.\n\nCompetency determinations implicate due process.— Competency determinations implicate due process rights. A court violates a defendant's due process rights when it fails to inquire into competency after the defendant presents enough evidence to entitle him to a hearing on the issue. A hearing on the defendant's competency requires adequate notice, an adversarial hearing before an independent decision-maker, and a written statement from the fact finder clarifying the evidence relied upon and reasons for the decision.State v. Gutierrez, 2015-NMCA-082, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nWhere defendant was charged with numerous counts of attempted first-degree murder and other serious charges related to an incident where he trapped four adults and two children in a trailer and threatened them with firearms over several hours, the initial district judge, following a competency hearing, found that defendant was not competent to stand trial, that he was dangerous, and that he was not likely to become competent; defendant was then provided a hearing before a different district court judge for the sole purpose of determining whether defendant had mental retardation; the second district court judge found, on her own motion, without notice, and without any argument from the state, that defendant had been proved competent beyond a reasonable doubt; defendant was denied his procedural right to effective and timely notice and the opportunity to present arguments and evidence before having a decision rendered against him as to competency; moreover the district judge, in failing to examine the factors for determining competency, never provided defendant with any justification for the decision and subsequent actions.State v. Gutierrez, 2015-NMCA-082, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nThe prosecution of a defendant who is incompetent to stand trial violates due process.— Where defendant was tried and convicted of numerous counts of attempted first-degree murder and other serious charges related to an incident where he trapped four adults and two children in a trailer and threatened them with firearms over several hours, the initial district judge found, following a competency hearing prior to trial, that defendant was not competent to stand trial, that he was dangerous, and that he was not likely to become competent; defendant was later provided a hearing before a different district judge for the sole purpose of determining whether defendant had mental retardation; the second district court judge found that defendant had been proved competent beyond a reasonable doubt without making any findings as to whether defendant understood the nature and significance of the proceedings, whether defendant had a factual understanding of the charges or whether defendant was able to assist in his own defense, and, without any evidence presented regarding whether defendant had made or could make progress toward competency, disregarded the prior ruling made by the initial district judge that it was unlikely defendant would attain competency in the future; the evidence presented at the mental retardation hearing was insufficient to rebut the existing presumption that defendant was incompetent to stand trial. Defendant's trial violated due process.State v. Gutierrez, 2015-NMCA-082, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nSuppression.— Suppression hearing is not a legal impossibility at a hearing pursuant to this section; the statute does not preclude a defendant's attorney from putting on a complete defense at such a hearing.State v. Spriggs-Gore, 2003-NMCA-046, 133 N.M. 479, 64 P.3d 506, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 539, 65 P.3d 1094.\n\nDefendant, who was found incompetent to stand trial for first degree murder, was incompetent to knowingly and intelligently waive her constitutional rights; thus all of defendant's statements made after the first administration of her Miranda rights had to be suppressed.State v. Spriggs-Gore, 2003-NMCA-046, 133 N.M. 479, 64 P.3d 506, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 539, 65 P.3d 1094.\n\nProof of state of mind required.— In a case of first degree murder, the state has to prove a deliberate intention to kill, which \"may be inferred from all of the facts and circumstances of the killing.\" At a hearing under this section, the defendant is equally entitled to marshal a factual case that disproves either direct or inferential evidence that he had formed, or had the opportunity to form, a deliberate intent to kill.State v. Taylor, 2000-NMCA-072, 129 N.M. 376, 8 P.3d 863, cert. quashed, 131 N.M. 64, 33 P.3d 284.\n\nDefenses not available at Subsection A hearing.— The defenses of insanity and inability to form a specific intent are not available at a hearing conducted pursuant to Subsection A.State v. Werner, 1990-NMCA-019, 110 N.M. 389, 796 P.2d 610, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 704, 789 P.2d 1271.\n\nTrial court may draw inference as to dangerousness.— When the trial court has found that a defendant has cruelly treated a two-year-old child by holding her foot in hot water for half a minute and has injured his brother with a knife in the course of a family argument, the trial court may properly draw an inference that defendant is dangerous.State v. Gallegos, 1990-NMCA-104, 111 N.M. 110, 802 P.2d 15, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 77, 801 P.2d 659.\n\nFinding of dangerousness as prerequisite to detention.— In the context of the competency statutes, the finding of dangerousness is a prerequisite to the applicability of the portions of the statute allowing defendant to be detained for a longer period of time. Thus, the court must make a finding of dangerousness prior to the detention authorized by this section, but it need not have made such a finding at a prior hearing.State v. Gallegos, 1990-NMCA-104, 111 N.M. 110, 802 P.2d 15, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 77, 801 P.2d 659.\n\nEnhancement of commitment term must relate to dangerousness.— A defendant cannot be criminally committed under a sentence enhancement unless the conduct invoking the enhancement is a specific marker of dangerousness as defined by statute.State v. Chorney, 2001-NMCA-050, 130 N.M. 638, 29 P.3d 538.\n\nA term of criminal commitment may be increased due to aggravating circumstances that relate to a defendant's dangerousness.— A term of commitment under this section may be increased under NMSA 1978, § 31-18-15.1 due to aggravating circumstances that bear a direct relation to a defendant's dangerousness and that are supported by clear and convincing evidence.State v. Quintana, 2021-NMSC-013,aff'g2019-NMCA-030.\n\nDistrict court did not err in enhancing defendant's term of criminal commitment.— Where, following a criminal commitment hearing, the district court found that clear and convincing evidence existed to show that defendant committed the crime of second degree murder, and further found, following a subsequent evidentiary hearing, that the murder had been committed with extreme viciousness and brutality, including the near decapitation of the body, the removal of the genitals, the stabbing of the anus, as well as the numerous wounds to the decedent's head and torso, and that defendant represented a threat to community safety because if released without supervision, there was a danger that defendant would be medically non-compliant and that his psychosis would return, the district court did not err in enhancing defendant's sentence by five years for a total commitment of twenty years, representing the maximum time to which defendant would have been subject had defendant been convicted of the charged offense, because this section clearly indicates that determination of a term of criminal commitment should correspond to the maximum sentence that would have been reached under the Criminal Sentencing Act, including potential enhancement based on aggravating circumstances.State v. Quintana, 2021-NMSC-013,aff'g2019-NMCA-030.\n\nCommitment period may be enhanced based on aggravating circumstances.— Where defendant was charged with an open count of murder, and where after a hearing on defendant's competency to proceed to trial, the parties stipulated that the evidence was clear and convincing that defendant had committed the crime of second-degree murder, the district court did not err in ordering defendant to be committed to the New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute for fifteen years plus five years for aggravating circumstances based in part on the extreme viciousness and brutality of defendant's conduct, because this section permits a commitment equal to the maximum sentence to which the defendant would have been subject had the defendant been convicted in a criminal proceeding, and the legislature has made clear that a sentence may consist of a basic sentence plus additional terms of imprisonment to be imposed after assessment of additional factors.State v. Quintana, 2019-NMCA-030, cert. granted.\n\nHabitual offender enhancement does not apply.— The habitual offender enhancement (Section 31-18-17 NMSA 1978) does not apply to extend a defendant's criminal incompetency commitment.State v. Chorney, 2001-NMCA-050, 130 N.M. 638, 29 P.3d 538.\n\nDefendant's attorney may act as advocate.— There is nothing in the statute on its face that precludes defendant's attorney from acting as an advocate at a hearing under this section.State v. Gallegos, 1990-NMCA-104, 111 N.M. 110, 802 P.2d 15, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 77, 801 P.2d 659.",

      "text": "A. Upon motion of the defense requesting a ruling, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether the defendant has a developmental or intellectual disability as defined in Subsection E of this section.\n\nB. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has a developmental or intellectual disability and that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant will become competent to proceed in a criminal case within a reasonable period of time not to exceed nine months from the date of the original finding of incompetency, then, no later than sixty days from notification to the secretary of health or the secretary's designee of the court's findings, the department of health shall perform an evaluation to determine whether the defendant presents a likelihood of serious harm to self or others.\n\nC. If the department of health evaluation results in a finding that the defendant presents a likelihood of serious harm to self or others, within sixty days of the department's evaluation, the department shall commence proceedings pursuant to Chapter 43, Article 1 NMSA 1978 if the defendant was charged with murder in the first degree, first degree criminal sexual penetration, criminal sexual contact of a minor or arson in the initial proceedings, and the court presiding over the initial proceedings shall enter a finding that the respondent presents a likelihood of harm to others.\n\nD. The criminal charges shall be dismissed without prejudice after the hearing pursuant to Chapter 43, Article 1 NMSA 1978 or upon expiration of fourteen months from the court's initial determination that the defendant is incompetent to proceed in a criminal case.\n\nE. As used in this section, \"developmental or intellectual disability\" means significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior. An intelligence quotient of seventy or below on a reliably administered intelligence quotient test shall be presumptive evidence of developmental or intellectual disability.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 31-9-1.6, enacted by Laws 1997, ch. 153, § 1; 1999, ch. 149, § 5; 2023, ch. 113, § 10.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, updated terms relating to developmental and intellectual disabilities; in the section heading, deleted \"mental retardation\" and added \"developmental or intellectual disability\"; and deleted \"mental retardation\" and added \"a developmental or intellectual disability\" throughout the Section.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, substituted \"to determine whether the defendant has mental retardation as defined in Subsection E of this section\" for \"prior to one year after a defendant was determined to be incompetent to stand trial\" in Subsection A; substituted \"has mental retardation and that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant will become competent to proceed in a criminal case within a reasonable period of time not to exceed nine months from the date of the original finding of incompetency, then no later than sixty days from notification to the secretary of health or his designee of the court's findings\" for \"is mentally retarded, then no later than one year from the court's initial determination that the defendant is incompetent to stand trial\" in Subsection B; in Subsection C, inserted \"murder in the\" following \"charged with\", and deleted \"homicide\" preceding \"first degree\", inserted \"criminal\" following \"first degree\", and deleted former Paragraph (2), which read, \"may commence proceedings pursuant to Chapter 43, Article 1 NMSA 1978 if the defendant was charged with any crime other than first degree homicide, first degree sexual penetration, criminal sexual contact of a minor or arson in the initial proceeding from which he was referred pursuant to this section to the department\"; substituted \"proceed in a criminal case\" for \"stand trial\" in Subsection D; and substituted \"mental retardation\" for \"mentally retarded\" in Subsection E.\n\nAge of onset is irrelevant.— Where the defendant had an extreme mental condition resulting from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning that occurred when the defendant was twenty-six years of age, the district court's determination that the defendant had mental retardation was proper.State v. Trujillo, 2009-NMSC-012, 146 N.M. 14, 206 P.3d 125,aff'g, 2007-NMCA-056, 141 N.M. 668, 160 P.3d 577.\n\nCommitment of defendants who are accused of lesser crimes.— Defendants with mental retardation who are dangerous, incompetent and without substantial probability of gaining competence and who are not charged with first degree murder, first degree criminal sexual penetration, criminal sexual contact of a minor or arson may not be criminally committed, though they may be civilly committed at the discretion of the district court and the district attorney.State v. Trujillo, 2009-NMSC-012, 146 N.M. 14, 206 P.3d 125,aff'g, 2007-NMCA-056, 141 N.M. 668, 160 P.3d 577.\n\nWhere the defendant was charged with attempted first degree murder, aggravated burglary, aggravated battery and tampering with evidence, and where the district court found that the defendant had mental retardation and was dangerous, incompetent, and without a substantial probability of gaining competence, the defendant may not be criminally committed, though the defendant may be civilly committed at the discretion of the district court and the district attorney.State v. Trujillo, 2009-NMSC-012, 146 N.M. 14, 206 P.3d 125,aff'g, 2007-NMCA-056, 141 N.M. 668, 160 P.3d 577.\n\nAge of the onset of mental retardationis not an element of the definition of mental retardation and is irrelevant in a determination of mental retardation.State v. Trujillo, 2007-NMCA-056, 141 N.M. 668, 160 P.3d 577,aff'd, 2009-NMSC-012, 146 N.M. 14, 206 P.3d 125.\n\nSection 31-9-1.6 NMSA 1978 is the sole source of authorityto confine incompetent defendants with mental retardation who are dangerous.State v. Trujillo, 2007-NMCA-056, 141 N.M. 668, 160 P.3d 577,aff'd, 2009-NMSC-012, 146 N.M. 14, 206 P.3d 125.\n\nStatutory presumption of mental retardation.— A reliably administered IQ test resulting in an IQ of seventy or below shall be presumptive evidence of mental retardation; therefore, an IQ test of seventy or below creates a statutory presumption that defendant possesses subaverage general intellectual functioning concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior.State v. Gutierrez, 2015-NMCA-082, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nWhere defendant was charged with numerous counts of attempted first-degree murder and other serious charges related to an incident where he trapped four adults and two children in a trailer and threatened them with firearms over several hours, and where defendant consistently scored below seventy on all his intelligence assessments over the course of a year and a half, and where one doctor found that defendant had a full-scale IQ of sixty-two, and two other doctors found defendant to be in the \"mild mental retardation\" range with scores in the lowest percentile on verbal comprehension, the evidence demonstrated that defendant had mental retardation as a matter of law.State v. Gutierrez, 2015-NMCA-082, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nDefendant met the statutory presumption of mental retardation.— Where defendant was arrested for aggravated battery after allegedly attacking his mother with a pair of garden shears, and where defendant moved for a hearing pursuant to this section to determine whether he was mentally retarded and therefore subject only to civil commitment and not criminal prosecution, the district court abused its discretion in determining that defendant failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he was mentally retarded as defined by Subsection E of this section, because defendant met the statutory presumption of mental retardation by showing that he had an IQ of seventy or less and that the test used to determine that IQ was reliably administered. Once the presumption of mental retardation is established, the burden shifts to the state to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant does not have mental retardation, either by establishing that defendant does not have significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning or that he does not have deficits in his adaptive behavior, or both.State v. Jacob F., 2019-NMCA-042.\n\nPermitting court-appointed psychologist to attend independent evaluation of defendant was not an abuse of discretion.— Where defendant was charged as a serious youthful offender with two alternative counts of first-degree felony murder, and where the state requested, and the district court allowed, an independent evaluation of defendant's alleged mental retardation following a court-appointed psychologist's recommendation that defendant be found incompetent to stand trial due to mental retardation, the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting a defense request permitting the court-appointed psychologist to attend the state's independent evaluation, because the district court's decision to order a second evaluation was entirely discretionary and, due to the unnecessary delay that had already occurred in the case, the court-appointed psychologist's attendance would ensure that the proceedings were expedited.State v. Linares, 2017-NMSC-014.\n\nDistrict court did not abuse its discretion in finding defendant incompetent.— Where defendant was charged as a serious youthful offender with two alternative counts of first-degree felony murder, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding defendant incompetent to stand trial based on a court-appointed psychologist's testimony that defendant had an IQ of 68, that defendant had mental retardation, that the state failed to overcome the presumption that an accused with an IQ below 70 has mental retardation, and based on evidence adduced at the mental retardation hearing that defendant was incapable of consulting with her attorney with a reasonable degree of rational understanding, that she held a fundamentally incoherent view of the nature of the proceedings that were to be brought against her, and that she would not comprehend the reasons for punishment if she were convicted.State v. Linares, 2017-NMSC-014.\n\nProcedural requirements were met.— Where defendant was charged as a serious youthful offender with two alternative counts of first-degree felony murder, the proceedings below complied with the mandates of this section where the district court found that defendant was incompetent to stand trial due to mental retardation, that there was not a substantial probability that defendant would become competent within a reasonable period of time not to exceed nine months, and that defendant was a danger to others, and where the district court directed the department of health (DOH) to commence civil commitment proceedings under 43-1-1 NMSA 1978, and where DOH filed a petition with the district court for the involuntary commitment of defendant prompting the district court to commit defendant to the DOH for a period of habilitation not to exceed six months.State v. Linares, 2017-NMSC-014.",

Where the defendant is determined to be indigent, the court shall pay for the costs of the examination from funds available to the court.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 41-13-3.2, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 231, § 3.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 1972, ch. 71, § 18, repealed 41-13-3, 1953 Comp., referred to in this section.\n\nRequirements on court.— Whenever a legitimate concern about the present ability of a defendant to consult and understand is brought to the court's attention, the court is required to consider whatever competency-related evidence is before the court and to determine whether there exists a reasonable doubt as the defendant's competency to stand trial. If the court determines that there is reasonable doubt as to defendant's competency, the court must have defendant's competency professionally evaluated by a qualified professional who must submit a report to the court.State v. Flores, 2005-NMCA-135, 138 N.M. 636, 124 P.3d 1175, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-011, 138 N.M. 586, 124 P.3d 564.\n\nIn considering whether reasonable doubt exists,the court must keep in mind the requirement that defendant must have sufficient present ability to consult and understand as required under due process of law.State v. Flores, 2005-NMCA-135, 138 N.M. 636, 124 P.3d 1175, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-011, 138 N.M. 586, 124 P.3d 564.\n\nEntire act (article 31-9) should be read and considered togetherin arriving at a proper meaning or legislative intent.State v.

Ed. 2d 77.\n\nExamination depends upon raising of competency issue.— The mental examination required by this section depends upon a \"question\" as to mental competency first being raised. A \"question\" on the issue of mental competency is raised only upon a showing of reasonable cause to believe that the defendant is not competent to stand trial.State v. Smith, 1969-NMCA-101, 80 N.M. 742, 461 P.2d 157.\n\nDefendant's motion makes examination mandatory.— If a defendant moves for a mental examination, this section makes it mandatory for the trial court to order such an examination before determining defendant's competency and such an examination is not necessary unless \". . . there is a question as to the mental capacity of a defendant to stand trial . . ..\"State v. Hovey, 1969-NMCA-049, 80 N.M. 373, 456 P.2d 206.\n\nMotion must include grounds for belief of lack of capacity.— A motion on behalf of an accused for a judicial determination of mental competency to stand trial shall set forth the ground for belief that such mental capacity is lacking. When the motion does not set forth grounds for reasonable cause to believe the defendant may be insane or mentally incompetent, the motion can be denied. \"The statute requires such an examination only when it is shown that there is reasonable cause to believe that an accused may be presently insane or otherwise mentally incompetent.\"State v. Hovey, 1969-NMCA-049, 80 N.M. 373, 456 P.2d 206.\n\nOtherwise, court not required to grant motion.— An examination is not necessary, nor is the court required to grant a motion seeking such examination unless there is a question as to the mental capacity of defendant.State v. Morales, 1970-NMCA-036, 81 N.M. 333, 466 P.2d 899, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 305, 466 P.2d 871, and cert. denied, 400 U.S. 842, 91 S. Ct. 84, 27 L. Ed. 2d 77.\n\nCounsel's impressions of defendant's mental state insufficient.— \"Wondering\" about defendant's mental capacity which is based solely on counsel's impression was not reasonable cause for a belief that defendant was incompetent to stand trial.State v. Hovey, 1969-NMCA-049, 80 N.M. 373, 456 P.2d 206.\n\nMedical records should be available to attorneys before trial.— Where there was no showing from the record that the disclosure of a psychiatric report to the prosecuting attorney in any way constituted a violation of defendant's fifth amendment rights, the court will not assume facts not supported by the record. A commitment to a public institution by court order is for essentially a public purpose, no matter who commenced it, and the medical records thereof should be available in advance of trial to both prosecution and defense.State v.
