      "text": "A. Unless otherwise provided in this section, all persons convicted of a crime under the laws of New Mexico shall be sentenced in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Sentencing Act; provided, that a person sentenced as a serious youthful offender or as a youthful offender may be sentenced to less than the basic or mandatory sentence prescribed by the Criminal Sentencing Act.\n\nB. Whenever a defendant is convicted of a crime under the constitution of New Mexico, or a statute not contained in the Criminal Code [30-1-1 NMSA 1978], which specifies the penalty to be imposed on conviction, the court shall set as a definite term of imprisonment the minimum term prescribed by the statute or constitutional provision and may impose the fine prescribed by the statute or constitutional provision for the particular crime for which the person was convicted; provided, that a person sentenced as a serious youthful offender or as a youthful offender may be sentenced to less than the minimum term of imprisonment prescribed by the statute or the constitutional provision.\n\nC. A crime declared to be a felony by the constitution or a statute not contained in the Criminal Code, without specification of the sentence or fine to be imposed on conviction, shall constitute a fourth degree felony as prescribed under the Criminal Code for the purpose of the sentence, and the defendant shall be so sentenced.\n\nD. Any other crime for which the sentence to be imposed upon conviction is not specified shall constitute, for the purpose of the sentence, a petty misdemeanor.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-29-27, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 216, § 2; 1993, ch. 77, § 4.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, added the provisos at the end of Subsections A and B, and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nCriminal sentences must be imposed as prescribed by statute.State v. Baros, 1968-NMSC-001, 78 N.M. 623, 435 P.2d 1005.\n\nThe district court did not err in granting specific performance of the plea agreement.— Where defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance after officers seized 152 fentanyl pills from defendant after finding him under the influence of narcotics and asleep in his vehicle, and where defendant agreed to waive his constitutional right to a preliminary hearing and to plead guilty in district court to felony possession of a controlled substance in exchange for the state agreeing to a guaranteed specific sentence of eighteen months of probation, and where the state sought to withdraw the plea agreement prior to its acceptance by the district court, arguing that the plea agreement provided a deadline of thirty days following the filing of the wavier for that offer and that the public defender's office failed to initiate the plea paperwork within that time limit, the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion to specifically enforce the plea agreement, because when the state promises a specific plea in exchange for a defendant relinquishing a right or cooperating with the state pre-plea, the plea agreement is specifically enforceable if the defendant relinquishes the right or performs their part of the bargain with the state. Moreover, defendant relied to his detriment on the state's promised plea agreement by giving up legal challenges to his arrest and the constitutionally guaranteed hearing requiring the state to prove that probable cause supported the possession charge, and defendant did not reasonably understand that the agreement was contingent on a deadline for plea paperwork.State v. Jurado, 2024-NMCA-058, cert. denied.\n\nPlea agreements will be specifically enforced.— Where defendant entered into three plea agreements in which the state agreed that defendant would serve zero to nine years of incarceration, supervised probation, treatment program or a combination thereof and that the sentences in each case would be served concurrently with each other; and the district court accepted the plea agreements and sentenced defendant to twenty-one years in prison, with sixteen years suspended, for an actual prison term of five year, plus five years of supervised probation, the sentence violated the terms of the plea agreements, because the suspended sentence allowed for the possibility that defendant could actually serve more than nine years in prison and defendant was entitled to specific performance of the plea agreements.State v. Gomez, 2011-NMCA-120, 267 P.3d 831.\n\nPlea agreement provided for a specific sentence.— Where the plea agreement provided for a maximum sentence of forty years and the court accepted the plea, the plea agreement constituted a promise, not a recommendation, for a sentence within a particular range that the court was bound to enforce and the imposition of a forty-two year sentence, nine of which were suspended, violated the sentence cap in the plea agreement.State v. Miller, 2012-NMCA-051, 278 P.3d 561, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-005.\n\nPlea agreement for a maximum permissible sentence \"at initial sentencing\".— Where the plea agreement provided for a maximum sentence of forty years \"at initial sentencing\", the phrase \"at initial sentencing\" did not transform the limit on sentencing into a limit on the initial period of incarceration because the sentence could not be increased at a later date and the court's sentence of forty-two years imprisonment, nine of which were suspended, violated the plea agreement.State v. Miller, 2012-NMCA-051, 278 P.3d 561, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-005.\n\nSentence otherwise imposed void.— Sentences must be imposed as prescribed by statute, and a sentence otherwise imposed was not merely irregular, but was null and void, and a void sentence may be vacated even though it has been partially served.State v. Peters, 1961-NMSC-160, 69 N.M. 302, 366 P.2d 148, cert. denied, 369 U.S. 831, 82 S. Ct. 849, 7 L. Ed. 2d 796 (1962).\n\nSentences which are unauthorized by law are null and void.Sneed v. Cox, 1964-NMSC-250, 74 N.M. 659, 397 P.2d 308.\n\nFixing of penalties is legislative function,and what constitutes an adequate punishment is a matter for legislative judgment, and the question of whether the punishment for a given crime is too severe and disproportionate to the offense is for the legislature to determine.State v. Peters, 1967-NMSC-171, 78 N.M. 224, 430 P.2d 382.\n\nFor crimes committed prior to July 1, 1979,the sentencing provision in effect at the time of the commission of the crime controls.State v. Hargrove, 1989-NMSC-012, 108 N.M. 233, 771 P.2d 166.\n\nSubsection B controls over DWI statute.— Section 66-8-102E NMSA 1978 (now Section 66-8-102F NMSA 1978) which provides that where the conviction is for a second or subsequent DWI, the offense is punishable by imprisonment for not less than ninety days or more than one year, does not control over Subsection B of this section which provides the method for establishing the applicable determinate sentence for offenses not contained in the Criminal Code.State v. Greyeyes, 1987-NMCA-022, 105 N.M. 549, 734 P.2d 789, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 521, 734 P.2d 761.\n\nMotor Vehicle Code violation petty misdemeanor.— Section 66-8-7B NMSA 1978 (Motor Vehicle Code violation) is governed by the provisions of Subsection D of this section. The violation is not declared to be a felony. Since it is not declared to be a felony and is not punishable by a specified sentence, Subsection D applies.State v. Mendoza, 1993-NMCA-027, 115 N.M. 772, 858 P.2d 860, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 359, 851 P.2d 481.\n\nSection does not apply to contempt sentence.— Contempt is not a \"crime\" under Section 34-1-2 NMSA 1978, and therefore, this section does not apply to a contempt sentence.State v. Case, 1985-NMCA-027, 103 N.M. 574, 711 P.2d 19,rev'd on other grounds, 103 N.M. 501, 709 P.2d 670.\n\nEffect of acquittal on one count of indictment.— The mere fact that the jury saw fit to acquit the defendant on one count of the indictment cannot be construed as effectuating a determination of the factual issues under another count, even though the same evidence is offered in support of both counts of the indictment; as the reason for the acquittals is speculative, the acquittals, even though irreconcilable with the conviction, do not require the conviction to be set aside as a matter of law.State v. Rogers, 1969-NMCA-034, 80 N.M. 230, 453 P.2d 593.\n\nEffective date of resentenceis the date when the initial sentence commenced.State v. Dalrymple, 1966-NMSC-203, 77 N.M. 4, 419 P.2d 218.\n\nEffect of sentence in excess of that permitted by law.— Where a court has jurisdiction of the person and the offense, the imposition of a sentence in excess of what the law permits does not render the legal or authorized portion of the sentence void, but only leaves such portion in excess open to question and attack. A sentence is legal so far as it is within the provisions of law and the jurisdiction of the court over the person and the offense, and only void as to the excess, when such excess is separable and may be dealt with without disturbing the valid portion of the sentence.Sneed v. Cox, 1964-NMSC-250, 74 N.M. 659, 397 P.2d 308.\n\nLegal or authorized portion valid.— The imposition of a sentence in excess of what the law permits does not render the legal or authorized portion of the sentence void, but only leaves such portion in excess open to attack, unless such portion is inseparable and cannot be dealt with without disturbing the valid portion of the sentence.State v. Baros, 1968-NMSC-001, 78 N.M. 623, 435 P.2d 1005.\n\nWhen probationary part of sentence void.— Where the court ordered defendant placed on probation without deferring or suspending any of his sentences, this action is not within the bounds prescribed by law, and therefore, the probationary part of the defendant's sentence is void.State v. Nolan, 1979-NMCA-116, 93 N.M. 472, 601 P.2d 442, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 683, 604 P.2d 821.\n\nII. JUDICIAL DISCRETION.\n\nSua sponte amendment of sentence.— Where defendant was convicted of possession of child pornography; the court sentenced defendant to three years of imprisonment, suspended thirty-four and one-half years, followed by five years of supervised probation and on the following day, after reconsidering the court's reliance on the fact that defendant had no criminal history and the evidence in the case, the court revised the sentence to nine years of imprisonment, the court did not abuse its discretion.State v. Ballard, 2012-NMCA-043, 276 P.3d 976, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-005.\n\nCourt may impose statutory sentence notwithstanding jury's recommendation for clemency.— Trial court did not err in refusing to grant appellant's motion to vacate for the reason that, despite the jury's recommendation for clemency, minor was sentenced for armed robbery to the maximum term permitted by law.State v. Henry, 1967-NMSC-265, 78 N.M. 573, 434 P.2d 692.\n\nStatutory sentence notwithstanding recommendation in diagnostic report.— Where the sentence was in accordance with law, an appellate court cannot say it was unjust or improper in the circumstances because recommendations in a diagnostic report for a more lenient sentence were not followed or because the statutory sentence is imposed on a 17-year old first offender.State v. Madrigal, 1973-NMCA-116, 85 N.M. 496, 513 P.2d 1278, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 483, 513 P.2d 1265.\n\nCourt need not impose identical sentences on joint defendants.— There is no requirement in criminal procedure that a court impose identical sentences upon persons jointly guilty of a crime.State v. Holly, 1968-NMCA-075, 79 N.M. 516, 445 P.2d 393.\n\nCourt statutorily limited in sentencing authority.— The district court's authority to sentence is only that which has been provided by statute.State v. Sparks, 1985-NMCA-004, 102 N.M. 317, 694 P.2d 1382.\n\nSuspended or deferred sentence within discretion of trial court.— Of the sentencing alternatives available, a suspended or deferred sentence is within the discretion of the trial court.State v. Madrigal, 1973-NMCA-116, 85 N.M. 496, 513 P.2d 1278, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 483, 513 P.2d 1265 (decided under former law).\n\nSentencing judge has discretion in determining whether sentences are to run consecutivelyor concurrently. His discretion in this area will not be interfered with unless he has violated one of the sentencing statutes.State v. Deats, 1971-NMCA-089, 82 N.M. 711, 487 P.2d 139.\n\nCourt should not fix date when sentence to commence.— It is improper for a trial court to fix a date when the sentence should commence.Sneed v. Cox, 1964-NMSC-250, 74 N.M. 659, 397 P.2d 308.\n\nJurisdiction of trial court to sentence is not exhausted until sentence pronounced,and will carry over from term to term.Pavlich v. State, 1968-NMSC-147, 79 N.M. 473, 444 P.2d 984.\n\nSentences cannot be increased after first commitmenthas begun.Deats v. State, 1972-NMCA-155, 84 N.M. 405, 503 P.2d 1183.\n\nCredit where prisoner has served part of void sentence.— It is proper to allow credit where a prisoner is resentenced without a new trial after serving part of a void sentence.Sneed v. Cox, 1964-NMSC-250, 74 N.M. 659, 397 P.2d 308.\n\nIII. SPECIFIC SENTENCES.\n\nLife sentence is not mandatory for a second conviction of trafficking in heroinand the court has the authority to suspend or defer the sentence imposed.State v. Sanchez, 1982-NMSC-032, 97 N.M. 521, 641 P.2d 1068.\n\nProper to enhance sentence under both habitual offender and firearm enhancement provisions.— It is not improper to enhance a sentence under the general habitual offender statute if it has already been enhanced under the firearm enhancement statute.State v. Reaves, 1982-NMCA-169, 99 N.M. 73, 653 P.2d 904.\n\nValidity of consecutive sentences.— Where 1969 sentences were expressly made consecutive to 1967 sentences, and eight sentences in 1969 were also expressly made consecutive, these nine consecutive sentences were validly imposed.Deats v. State, 1972-NMCA-155, 84 N.M. 405, 503 P.2d 1183.\n\nSpecial probation condition did not terminate parental rights.— Where defendant pleaded guilty to eight counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor in the fourth degree, the charges stemming from a series of incidents that occurred over the course of several months between defendant and one of his adopted daughters, and after the sentencing hearing, the district court imposed nine conditions of probation, with one condition prohibiting defendant from having direct or indirect contact with all children under the age of 18, including the victim of his crimes, absent a court order, the specific condition did not amount to a \"de facto\" termination of parental rights, necessitating jurisdiction within the children's court.State v. Garcia, 2005-NMCA-065, 137 N.M. 583, 113 P.3d 406.\n\nJurisdiction to revoke probation imposed under consecutive sentences.— Where two consecutive sentences are imposed, as to the second sentence, the district court retained jurisdiction to revoke a defendant's probation when probation violations occurred before the defendant had begun serving the second sentence to which the probation is attached and as to the first sentence, which the defendant had completed serving, the district court did not have jurisdiction to revoke the probation that was attached to the first sentence.State v. Lopez, 2006-NMCA-079, 140 N.M. 1, 138 P.3d 534,aff'd2007-NMSC-011, 141 N.M. 293, 154 P.3d 668.\n\nMagistrate court may order restitution.— The magistrate court may, as part of its sentencing power, order a Criminal Code or Motor Vehicle Code violator to make restitution. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-18.\n\nLaw reviews.— For symposium, \"The Impact of the Equal Rights Amendment on the New Mexico Criminal Code,\" see 3 N.M.L.

      "text": "When a defendant has been convicted of a capital felony, the defendant shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or life imprisonment without possibility of release or parole.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 31-18-14, enacted by Laws 1979, ch. 150, § 1; 1993, ch. 77, § 5; 2009, ch. 11, § 1.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1979, ch. 150, § 1, repealed former 31-18-14 NMSA 1978 (40A-29-27.1, 1953 Comp.), relating to life imprisonment for conviction of a capital felony, and enacted the above section.\n\nCross references.— For capital felony sentencing procedure,see31-20A-2 and 31-20A-5 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, abolished the death penalty and provided for sentencing to life imprisonment without possibility of release or parole.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, substituted \"may be sentenced\" for \"shall be sentenced\" in the last sentence of Subsection A and added \"but shall not be punished by death\" at the end thereof.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2009, ch. 11, § 6 provided that the provisions of this section apply to crimes committed on or after July 1, 2009.\n\nConstitutionality.— Where defendant pled guilty to one count of first-degree, willful and deliberate murder, and where, prior to sentencing, defendant filed a motion seeking the opportunity to present mitigating evidence which could eventually shorten his sentence, arguing that Section 31-18-14 NMSA 1978 is unconstitutional because it does not provide for the opportunity for capital felons to present evidence of mitigating circumstances at sentencing and Section 31-18-15.1 NMSA 1978 requires the district court to hold a sentencing hearing for lesser offenses, defendant's equal protection rights were not violated, because first-degree murderers are not similarly situated to lesser offenders, in that first-degree murderers are guilty of a categorically more serious offense. It is a lawful exercise of legislative authority to impose distinct sentencing schemes for first-degree murder and lesser offenses, and the language of Section 31-18-14 reflects an intent that those convicted of first-degree murder be treated differently from less serious offenders, regardless of the maximum possible penalty.State v. Franklin, 2018-NMSC-015.\n\nLife sentence for mentally ill offender constitutional.— Mandatory life sentence for a capital crime committed by a defendant found to be guilty but mentally ill did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.Neely v. Newton, 149 F.3d 1074 (10th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1107, 119 S. Ct. 877, 142 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1999).\n\nIt is first degree murder that the legislature has designated as eligible for capital sentencingwhen an aggravating circumstance is present.State v. Fry, 2006-NMSC-001, 138 N.M. 700, 126 P.3d 516 (decided prior to 2009 repeal of death penalty).\n\nNew Mexico's death penalty is unconstitutional,and the penalty to be imposed for a conviction of first-degree murder is life imprisonment.State v. Noble, 1977-NMSC-031, 90 N.M. 360, 563 P.2d 1153 (decided prior to 2009 repeal of death penalty).\n\nThis section, which provided, upon conviction of a capital crime, for mandatory sentence of death, and leaves neither judge nor jury discretion to impose a lesser sentence, violates state and federal constitutional provisions against cruel and unusual punishment and is void. This action revives previous 40A-29-2, 1953 Comp., as it existed before its amendment in 1973, but that section was likewise unconstitutional and void in that it left recommendation of death or life imprisonment to the unbridled discretion of the jury. Therefore, maximum penalty available for defendants convicted of murder is life imprisonment.State v. Rondeau, 1976-NMSC-044, 89 N.M. 408, 553 P.2d 688 (decided prior to 2009 repeal of death penalty).\n\nLife imprisonment proper penalty for serious felonies.— The imposition of the death penalty for felony-murder, rape, aggravated sodomy and kidnapping was unconstitutional; the proper penalty to be imposed was life imprisonment.State v. Melton, 1977-NMSC-014, 90 N.M. 188, 561 P.2d 461 (decided prior to 2009 repeal of death penalty).\n\nMandatory nature of section.— The court did not have discretion not to sentence the defendant, a minor, to a life term after a conviction of a first degree capital felony.State v. Taylor, 1988-NMSC-023, 107 N.M. 66, 752 P.2d 781 (decided prior to 1993 amendment) (decided prior to 2009 repeal of death penalty).\n\nDeath qualification of a jury,properly conducted, is not grounds for reversal.State v. Gilbert, 1983-NMSC-083, 100 N.M. 392, 671 P.2d 640, cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1073, 104 S. Ct. 1429, 79 L.

      "text": "A. As used in a statute that establishes a noncapital felony, the following defined felony classifications and associated basic sentences of imprisonment are as follows:\n\nFELONY CLASSIFICATION\n\nBASIC SENTENCE\n\nfirst degree felony resulting in the death of a child\n\nlife imprisonment\n\nfirst degree felony for aggravated criminal sexual penetration\n\nlife imprisonment\n\nfirst degree felony\n\neighteen years imprisonment\n\nsecond degree felony resulting in the death of a human being\n\neighteen years imprisonment\n\nsecond degree felony for a sexual offense against a child\n\nfifteen years imprisonment\n\nsecond degree felony for sexual exploitation of children\n\ntwelve years imprisonment\n\nsecond degree felony\n\nnine years imprisonment\n\nthird degree felony resulting in the death of a human being\n\nsix years imprisonment\n\nthird degree felony for a sexual offense against a child\n\nsix years imprisonment\n\nthird degree felony for sexual exploitation of children\n\neleven years imprisonment\n\nthird degree felony\n\nthree years imprisonment\n\nfourth degree felony for sexual exploitation of children\n\nten years imprisonment\n\nfourth degree felony\n\neighteen months imprisonment.\n\nB. The appropriate basic sentence of imprisonment shall be imposed upon a person convicted and sentenced pursuant to Subsection A of this section, unless the court alters the sentence pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Sentencing Act.\n\nC. A period of parole shall be imposed only for felony convictions wherein a person is sentenced to imprisonment of more than one year, unless the parties to a proceeding agree that a period of parole should be imposed. If a period of parole is imposed, the court shall include in the judgment and sentence of each person convicted and sentenced to imprisonment in a corrections facility designated by the corrections department authority for a period of parole to be served in accordance with the provisions of Section 31-21-10 NMSA 1978 after the completion of any actual time of imprisonment and authority to require, as a condition of parole, the payment of the costs of parole services and reimbursement to a law enforcement agency or local crime stopper program in accordance with the provisions of that section. If imposed, the period of parole shall be deemed to be part of the sentence of the convicted person in addition to the basic sentence imposed pursuant to Subsection A of this section together with alterations, if any, pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Sentencing Act.\n\nD. When a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-18-15.1, 31-18-16 or 31-18-17 NMSA 1978 and suspends or defers the basic sentence of imprisonment provided pursuant to the provisions of Subsection A of this section, the period of parole shall be served in accordance with the provisions of Section 31-21-10 NMSA 1978 for the degree of felony for the basic sentence for which the inmate was convicted. For the purpose of designating a period of parole, a court shall not consider that the basic sentence of imprisonment was suspended or deferred and that the inmate served a period of imprisonment pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Sentencing Act.\n\nE. The court may, in addition to the imposition of a basic sentence of imprisonment, impose a fine not to exceed:\n\n(1) for a first degree felony resulting in the death of a child, seventeen thousand five hundred dollars ($17,500);\n\n(2) for a first degree felony for aggravated criminal sexual penetration, seventeen thousand five hundred dollars ($17,500);\n\n(3) for a first degree felony, fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000);\n\n(4) for a second degree felony resulting in the death of a human being, twelve thousand five hundred dollars ($12,500);\n\n(5) for a second degree felony for a sexual offense against a child, twelve thousand five hundred dollars ($12,500);\n\n(6) for a second degree felony for sexual exploitation of children, five thousand dollars ($5,000);\n\n(7) for a second degree felony, ten thousand dollars ($10,000);\n\n(8) for a third degree felony resulting in the death of a human being, five thousand dollars ($5,000);\n\n(9) for a third degree felony for a sexual offense against a child, five thousand dollars ($5,000);\n\n(10) for a third degree felony for sexual exploitation of children, five thousand dollars ($5,000);\n\n(11) for a third or fourth degree felony, five thousand dollars ($5,000); or\n\n(12) for a fourth degree felony for sexual exploitation of children, five thousand dollars ($5,000).\n\nF. When the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for a felony offense, the court shall indicate whether or not the offense is a serious violent offense as defined in Section 33-2-34 NMSA 1978. The court shall inform an offender that the offender's sentence of imprisonment is subject to the provisions of Sections 33-2-34, 33-2-36, 33-2-37 and 33-2-38 NMSA 1978. If the court fails to inform an offender that the offender's sentence is subject to those provisions or if the court provides the offender with erroneous information regarding those provisions, the failure to inform or the error shall not provide a basis for a writ of habeas corpus.\n\nG. No later than October 31 of each year, the New Mexico sentencing commission shall provide a written report to the secretary of corrections, all New Mexico criminal court judges, the administrative office of the district attorneys and the chief public defender. The report shall specify the average reduction in the sentence of imprisonment for serious violent offenses and nonviolent offenses, as defined in Section 33-2-34 NMSA 1978, due to meritorious deductions earned by prisoners during the previous fiscal year pursuant to the provisions of Sections 33-2-34, 33-2-36, 33-2-37 and 33-2-38 NMSA 1978. The corrections department shall allow the commission access to documents used by the department to determine earned meritorious deductions for prisoners.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-29-28, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 216, § 4; 1979, ch. 152, § 1; 1980, ch. 38, § 1; 1981, ch. 285, § 1; 1987, ch. 139, § 3; 1993, ch. 38, § 1; 1993, ch. 182, § 1; 1994, ch. 23, § 3; 1999, ch. 238, § 5; 2003, ch. 75, § 4; 2003 (1st S.S.), ch. 1, § 5; 2005, ch. 59, § 2; 2007, ch. 69, § 2; 2016, ch. 2, § 2; 2019, ch. 211, § 7; 2022, ch. 56, § 29; 2024, ch. 51, § 2.\n\nThe 2024 amendment,effective May 15, 2024, increased the penalty for a second-degree felony resulting in the death of a human being; and in Subsection A, after \"second degree felony resulting in the death of a human being\", changed \"fifteen\" to \"eighteen\".\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective May 18, 2022, clarified noncapital felony sentencing provisions; and in Subsection A, deleted \"If a person is convicted of\" and added \"As used in a statute that establishes\", and added \"following defined felony classifications and associated\", and after \"basic\", deleted \"sentence\" and added \"sentences\", and deleted Paragraphs A(1) through A(13) and added the remainder of the subsection.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective July 1, 2019, required that parole shall be imposed only for felony convictions where a person is sentenced to imprisonment for more than one year, unless the parties to a proceeding agree that a period of parole should be imposed; and in Subsection C, added \"A period of parole shall be imposed only for felony convictions wherein a person is sentenced to imprisonment of more than one year, unless the parties to a proceeding agree that a period of parole should be imposed. If a period of parole is imposed\", and after the next period, added \"If imposed\".\n\nThe 2016 amendment,effective February 25, 2016, created a new basic sentence structure in the Criminal Sentencing Act for sexual exploitation of children offenses; in Subsection A, added new Paragraph (6) and redesignated former Paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) as Paragraphs (7), (8) and (9), respectively, added new Paragraph (10) and redesignated former Paragraph (9) as Paragraph (11), in Paragraph (11), after the semicolon, deleted \"or\", and added new Paragraph (12) and redesignated Paragraph (10) as Paragraph (13); and in Subsection D, after \"31-18-16\", deleted \"31-18-16.1\"; in Subsection E, added Paragraph (6) and redesignated former Paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) as Paragraphs (7), (8) and (9), respectively, in Paragraph (9), after the semicolon, deleted \"or\", added new Paragraph (10) and redesignated former Paragraph (9) as Paragraph (11), in Paragraph (11), after the semicolon, added \"or\", and added new Paragraph (12).\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective July 1, 2007, imposed life imprisonment and a $17,500 fine for a first degree felony for aggravated criminal sexual penetration.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added Subsection A(1) to impose a life sentence for the conviction of a first degree felony resulting in the death of a child and Subsection E(1) to impose a fine of seventeen thousand five hundred dollars for a first degree felony resulting in the death of a child.\n\nThe 2003 (1st S.S.) amendment,effective February 3, 2004, inserted present Paragraphs (3) and (6) and redesignated former Paragraphs (3) through (6) accordingly in Subsection A, substituted \"and sentenced pursuant to Subsection A of this section, unless the court alters the\" for \"of a first, second, third or fourth degree felony or a second or third degree felony resulting in the death of a human being, unless the court alters such\" in Subsection B, deleted \"of a first, second, third or fourth degree felony or a second or third degree felony resulting in the death of a human being\" following \"convicted\" near the beginning of the first sentence in Subsection C, and inserted present Paragraphs (3) and (6) and redesignated former Paragraphs (3) through (5) accordingly in Subsection E.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003 in Subsection G substituted \"New Mexico sentencing commission\" for \"criminal and juvenile justice coordinating council\" near the beginning; and substituted \"commission\" for \"coordinating council\" near the end.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, added \"meritorious deductions\" to the section heading and added Subsections F and G.\n\nThe 1994 amendment,effective July 1, 1994, in Subsection A, inserted Paragraphs (2) and (4) and redesignated former Paragraphs (2) to (4) as Paragraphs (3), (5) and (6), and deleted \"or\" at the end of Paragraph (5); inserted \"or a second, third or fourth degree felony resulting in the death of a human being\" in Subsection B and in the first sentence in Subsection C; and, in Subsection E, inserted Paragraphs (2) and (4) and redesignated former Paragraphs (2) and (4) as Paragraphs (3) and (5).\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, inserted Subsection D, and redesignated former Subsection D as Subsection E. This section was also amended by Laws 1993, ch. 38, § 1, effective July 1, 1993. The section was set out as amended by Laws 1993, ch. 182, § 1.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nThe trial court has authority under Sections 31-18-15 and 31-18-15.1 NMSA 1978 to alter the basic sentence of life imprisonmentfor noncapital felonies if the court finds any mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense or concerning the offender.State v. Juan, 2010-NMSC-041, 148 N.M. 747, 242 P.3d 314.\n\nMethod for calculating one-third of a basic sentence of life imprisonment.— The thirty-year term for parole eligibility is the proper numerical standard by which to measure the trial court's authority to alter a basic sentence of life imprisonment under Sections 31-18-15 and 31-18-15.1 NMSA 1978. Because the trial court's alteration cannot exceed one-third of the basic sentence, the trial court lacks authority to reduce a defendant's parole eligibility by more than ten years.State v. Juan, 2010-NMSC-041, 148 N.M. 747, 242 P.3d 314.\n\nA basic sentence of life imprisonment is subject to mitigation.— Unlike a capital felony, a basic sentence of life imprisonment for a noncapital felony is not a mandatory life sentence and is subject to mitigation.State v. Cabezuela, 2015-NMSC-016.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of intentional child abuse resulting in the death of a child under twelve, defendant was found guilty of a noncapital felony, and as a result, the life sentence was basic, not mandatory, and the district court was required to consider mitigation evidence before issuing a final sentence.State v. Cabezuela, 2015-NMSC-016.\n\nThe trial court has authority to alter the basic sentence of all noncapital felonies.— Sections 31-18-15 and 31-18-15.1 NMSA 1978 explicitly grant the trial court the authority to alter the basic sentence for all noncapital felonies, including those that carry a basic life sentence of life imprisonment.State v. Montoya, 2015-NMSC-010.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of intentional child abuse resulting in the death of a child under twelve, which carried a basic sentence of life imprisonment, and where the district court believed that the law required a mandatory life sentence, the trial court abused its discretion when it misunderstood its authority and obligation to consider mitigating circumstances.State v. Montoya, 2015-NMSC-010.\n\nState v. Wilson, 2001-NMCA-032, 130 N.M. 319, 24 P.3d 351 can no longer be considered controlling authorityregarding sentencing enhancements of basic sentences.State v. Frawley, 2005-NMCA-017, 137 N.M. 18, 106 P.3d 580,overruled byState v. Lopez, 2005-NMSC-036, 138 N.M. 526, 123 P.3d 754,overruled byState v. Frawley, 2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\nFixing of penalties is a legislative function.State v. Hovey, 1975-NMCA-036, 87 N.M. 398, 534 P.2d 777;State v. Crespin, 1981-NMCA-095, 96 N.M. 640, 633 P.2d 1238.\n\nThe legislature establishes criminal penalties; the trial court's authority to sentence is that which has been provided by law.State v. Wilson, 1982-NMCA-019, 97 N.M. 534, 641 P.2d 1081, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nMandatory sentencing does not violate the doctrine of separation of powerscontained in N.M. Const., art. III, § 1.State v. Mabry, 1981-NMSC-067, 96 N.M. 317, 630 P.2d 269.\n\nCorrection of omission of mandatory provision.— Where a sentence lacks a statutorily-mandated provision, the trial court retains jurisdiction to correct the sentence by adding the omitted term.State v. Abril, 2003-NMCA-111, 134 N.M. 326, 76 P.3d 644, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 320, 76 P.3d 638.\n\nFactual finding of whether crime resulted \"in the death of a human being\"is for the jury and not the judge to make, underApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).State v. McDonald, 2003-NMCA-123, 134 N.M. 486, 79 P.3d 830, cert. granted, 2003-NMCERT-001, 134 N.M. 612, 81 P.3d 555 (decided under prior law).\n\nConspiracy to commit murder.— Conspiracy to commit murder is a felony \"resulting in the death of a human being\" within the meaning of this section.State v. Shije, 1998-NMCA-102, 125 N.M. 581, 964 P.2d 142 (decided under prior law).\n\n\"Serious violent offense\" finding mandatory.— The omission of any finding does not satisfy the statutory requirement of Subsection F of this section of an affirmative finding as to whether or not the defendant committed a serious violent offense.State v. Abril, 2003-NMCA-111, 134 N.M. 326, 76 P.3d 644, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 320, 76 P.3d 638.\n\nSerious violent offense.— Where victim of vehicular homicide was a teenager, defendant's breath alcohol level was three times the presumptive level of intoxication, defendant admitted to police that he should be arrested because he was drunk, defendant announced at the scene of the accident that he intended to drive away, and defendant was either too intoxicated to notice the headlights of victim's automobile or he was being untruthful by claiming that the headlights of victim's automobile were off, district court properly concluded that defendant acted with recklessness in the face of knowledge that his acts were reasonably likely to result in serious harm and designated defendant's crime as a serious violent offense.State v. Worrick, 2006-NMCA-035, 139 N.M. 247, 131 P.3d 97, cert. quashed, 2007-NMCERT-008, 142 N.M. 436, 166 P.3d 1090.\n\nDefendant must be afforded opportunity to speak before sentence pronounced.— Section 31-18-15.1 NMSA 1978 extends the common-law doctrine of allocutus to noncapital felonies, as enumerated in this section, and the trial judge must give the defendant an opportunity to speak before he pronounces sentence; failure to do so renders the sentence invalid.Tomlinson v. State, 1982-NMSC-074, 98 N.M. 213, 647 P.2d 415.\n\nVictim restitution policy not limited to cases where sentences suspended or deferred.— Section 31-17-1B NMSA 1978 contains no qualifying language limiting the application of the policy of victim restitution only to those cases in which a sentence is suspended or deferred.State v. Gross, 1982-NMCA-099, 98 N.M. 309, 648 P.2d 348, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794.\n\nMandatory probationary period may include restitution condition.— Section 31-17-1B NMSA 1978 does not limit or restrict the application of restitution only to those cases in which sentence is suspended or deferred. A mandatory probationary period may be included in the defendant's sentence with the condition to make restitution to the victim.State v. Ennis, 1982-NMCA-157, 99 N.M. 117, 654 P.2d 570, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 148, 655 P.2d 160.\n\nRestitution mandatory when sentence suspended or deferred.— Section 31-17-1B NMSA 1978 makes it mandatory to require victim restitution when a sentence is deferred or suspended; the court has no discretion in such instances.State v. Gross, 1982-NMCA-099, 98 N.M. 309, 648 P.2d 348, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794.\n\nA fine is a sentence.State v. Aragon, 1979-NMCA-074, 93 N.M. 132, 597 P.2d 317.\n\nDefendant sentenced under statute existing when crime was committed.— Where defendant committed voluntary manslaughter before Indeterminate Sentence Act was passed, but was convicted afterwards, defendant's sentencing under statute existing at time crime was committed was proper.State v. Armstrong, 1956-NMSC-053, 61 N.M. 258, 298 P.2d 941.\n\nGood behavior, indeterminate sentencing and parole laws are compatibleand are being administered right along together.Owens v. Swope, 1955-NMSC-079, 60 N.M. 71, 287 P.2d 605, cert. denied, 350 U.S. 954, 76 S. Ct. 343, 100 L. Ed. 830 (1956).\n\nNo constitutional separation-of-powers infirmity in unrestricted period-of-parole sentencing authority.— There is no constitutional separation-of-powers infirmity in the legislature's grant to the judiciary of an unrestricted period-of-parole sentencing authority, any more than there was in its grant to the parole board of the same power to set whatever period of parole the board chose to impose.State v. Freeman, 1980-NMCA-142, 95 N.M. 127, 619 P.2d 572, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 299, 621 P.2d 516.\n\nApplication to youthful offenders.— The basic sentences prescribed by this section are \"mandatory\" within the meaning of Section 32A-2-20D NMSA 1978, while the alterations in the basic sentences allowed by 31-18-15.1 NMSA 1978 are discretionary and, therefore, circumscribed by the Children's Code (Section 32A-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.); thus, the maximum sentence that may be imposed upon a youthful offender convicted of a non-capital felony is the basic sentence prescribed by this section, plus, if applicable, the enhancements prescribed by Sections 31-18-16 and 31-18-16.1 NMSA 1978 (repealed).State v. Guerra, 2001-NMCA-031, 130 N.M. 302, 24 P.3d 334, cert. deniedsub nom.State v. Ruby G., 130 N.M. 459 , 26 P.3d 103 (2001).\n\nApplicability of parole to indeterminate sentencing.— The parole provisions of this act apply to statutes such as Section 66-3-505 NMSA 1978 (now Section 30-16D-4 NMSA 1978) which prescribe an indeterminate period of imprisonment, and trial court did not lack authority to impose the statutory term of parole of one year in addition to discretionary two years confinement for transferring stolen vehicle.State v. Baker, 1993-NMCA-131, 116 N.M. 526, 864 P.2d 1277.\n\nII. JUDICIAL DISCRETION.\n\nSubsection B is mandatory.— Subsection B of this section is mandatory and limits the judge's sentencing discretion.State v. Lopez, 2005-NMSC-036, 138 N.M. 521, 123 P.3d 754,overruled byState v. Frawley, 2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\nTrial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendantpursuant to Subsection A of this section and in accordance with a plea agreement.State v. Aker, 2005-NMCA-063, 137 N.M. 561, 113 P.3d 384, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-005, 137 N.M. 522, 113 P.3d 345.\n\nNo entitlement to mitigation.— Mitigation of a sentence depends solely on the discretion of the district court and on no entitlement derived from any qualities of the defendant.State v. Cumpton, 2000-NMCA-033, 129 N.M. 47, 1 P.3d 429, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 688, 997 P.2d 820.\n\nThere is no obligation on the part of a judge to depart from the basic sentence.— Following defendant's conviction for second-degree murder, the district court judge heard from nine witnesses on defendant's behalf, but declined to mitigate defendant's sentence. Defendant was entitled to no more than a sentence prescribed by law, and it was within the district court's discretion to decline to mitigate defendant's sentence.State v. Suskiewich, 2016-NMCA-004, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-011.\n\nThis section does not prohibit consecutive sentencingbut leaves the issue to be resolved under the common law which gives the court the discretion to order that sentences be served concurrently or consecutively.State v. Jensen, 1998-NMCA-034, 124 N.M. 726, 955 P.2d 195.\n\nTrial court is without authority to fix lesser sentence than that providedby statute.State v. Beachum, 1970-NMCA-119, 82 N.M. 204, 477 P.2d 1019.\n\nImposition of sentence bars increased penalty.— After imposition of a valid sentence, a court may not increase the penalty.State v. Crespin, 1981-NMCA-095, 96 N.M. 640, 633 P.2d 1238.\n\nImpermissible to increase sentence because state failed to include \"mitigation\" language in sentence.— The use of the state's failure to include \"mitigation\" language in the judgment and sentence in order to later increase the defendant's sentence is impermissible. The proper remedy is to file an amended judgment and sentence containing the appropriate language.State v. Sisneros, 1981-NMCA-085, 98 N.M. 279, 648 P.2d 318,aff'd, 1984-NMSC-085, 101 N.M. 679, 687 P.2d 736,overruled on other grounds byState v. Saavedra, 1988-NMSC-100, 108 N.M. 38, 766 P.2d 298.\n\nAmendment of sentence to include mandatory parole period.— Where defendant's initial sentence lacked a mandatory parole period, it was not an illegal enhancement of the sentence for the court to amend the sentence to include the parole period even after the defendant had been released from the penitentiary having served his basic sentence of imprisonment.State v. Acuna, 1985-NMCA-083, 103 N.M. 279, 705 P.2d 685.\n\nCredit toward parole for time served.— The parole board, not the sentencing court, determines whether credit should be given toward a defendant's mandatory parole period for any time served.State v. Martinez, 1989-NMCA-036, 108 N.M. 604, 775 P.2d 1321, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 624, 776 P.2d 846.\n\nExecution of sentence bars imposition of additional punishment.— Once a sentence is executed by the payment of a fine, the trial court lacks authority to impose additional punishment upon defendant.State v. Aragon, 1979-NMCA-074, 93 N.M. 132, 597 P.2d 317.\n\nContradictory judgment renders sentence improper.— Where the trial court deferred a sentence of imprisonment and imposed a sentence of a fine for the same offense, either the deferral or the fine is subject to being stricken as an improper sentence, and the execution of either part of the sentence renders the remaining part void.State v. Aragon, 1979-NMCA-074, 93 N.M. 132, 597 P.2d 317.\n\nJudges not authorized to limit eligibility for parole.— The legislature has not authorized judges, in imposing sentence, to limit eligibility for parole, but rather has authorized the state board of probation and parole to grant paroles consistent with eligibility conditions established by the legislature; the judge may express his views concerning a prospective parole but the final decision on parole shall be of the board.State v. Hovey, 1975-NMCA-036, 87 N.M. 398, 534 P.2d 777.\n\nA provision in the trial court's judgment that defendant who pleaded guilty of a fourth-degree felony was not to be considered for parole for a minimum of one year was beyond the court's sentencing authority, was not a valid part of defendant's sentence and did not limit the authority of the state board of probation and parole to consider defendant for parole.State v. Hovey, 1975-NMCA-036, 87 N.M. 398, 534 P.2d 777.\n\nApplicability of parole to indeterminate sentencing.— The parole provisions of this act apply to statutes such as Section 66-3-505 NMSA 1978 (now Section 30-16D-4 NMSA 1978) which prescribe an indeterminate period of imprisonment, and trial court did not lack authority to impose the statutory term of parole of one year in addition to discretionary two years confinement for transferring stolen vehicle.State v. Baker, 1993-NMCA-131, 116 N.M. 526, 864 P.2d 1277.\n\nRefusal to grant leniency.— The sentencing court's imposition of the basic sentence for a fourth-degree felony and failure to suspend the sentence on the basis that the defendant refused to name his drug source did not constitute an increase, enhancement, or aggravation of the sentence imposed.State v. Sosa, 1996-NMSC-057, 122 N.M. 446, 926 P.2d 299.\n\nFactors that Earned Meritorious Deduction Actallows judge to find in order to limit credit under Section 33-2-34 L(4)(n) NMSA 1978 (now Section 33-2-34L(4)(o) NMSA 1978) do not have to be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Montoya, 2005-NMCA-078, 137 N.M. 713, 114 P.3d 393, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-006, 137 N.M. 766, 115 P.3d 229.\n\nIII. SPECIFIC SENTENCES.\n\nFailure to instruct jury to find whether crimes resulted in deathwas harmless error where overwhelming evidence was that defendant participated in armed robbery of victim, victim was beaten in head with metal pipe and suffered fractured skull, died soon thereafter of his injuries, and there was no evidence of another cause of death, nor did defendant dispute that armed robbery resulted in victim's death.State v. McDonald, 2004-NMSC-033, 136 N.M. 417, 99 P.3d 667.\n\nSentences served concurrently unless trial court or legislature requires consecutive sentences.— The trial court has discretion to require sentences to be served consecutively, but if this is not done, and there is no legislation covering the situation, the sentences are to be served concurrently.State v. Mayberry, 1982-NMCA-061, 97 N.M. 760, 643 P.2d 629.\n\nProper to enhance sentence under both habitual offender and firearm enhancement provisions.— It is not improper to enhance a sentence under the general habitual offender statute if it has already been enhanced under the firearm enhancement statute.State v. Reaves, 1982-NMCA-169, 99 N.M. 73, 653 P.2d 904.\n\nMultiple enhancements permitted.— In the absence of the type of \"dual use\" (i.e., when the same fact is used both as an element of the crime and a subsequent enhancement or as the basis for two separate enhancements) discussed inState v. Keith, 1985-NMCA-012, 102 N.M. 462, 697 P.2d 145, cert. denied, 102 N.M. 492, 697 P.2d 492 and its progeny, the legislature has authorized both enhancements under the basic sentencing statute and on the finding of aggravating circumstances.State v. McDonald, 2003-NMCA-123, 134 N.M. 486, 79 P.3d 830,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2004-NMSC-033, 136 N.M. 417, 99 P.3d 667.\n\nEnhanced sentences cannot be served concurrently.— An additional one-year sentence for the use of a firearm and an additional one-year sentence as an habitual offender cannot be served concurrently.State v. Mayberry, 1982-NMCA-061, 97 N.M. 760, 643 P.2d 629.\n\nEnhanced sentences invalidated.— Where defendant's basic sentences imposed under this section were increased under Section 31-18-15.1 NMSA 1978 based on the district court's findings of aggravating circumstances, and not based on a jury's findings and under a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the enhancements are invalidated.State v. Frawley, 2005-NMCA-017, 137 N.M. 18, 106 P.3d 580, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-002, 137 N.M. 265, 110 P.3d 73,overruled byState v. Lopez, 2005-NMSC-036, 138 N.M. 521, 123 P.3d 754,overruled byState v. Frawley, 2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\nProper aggravated battery sentence not made erroneous by superfluous reference to another offense.— Having stated his reason for altering the basic sentence for felony aggravated battery, the altered sentence is not made erroneous by the court's superfluous reference to another offense.State v. Wilson, 1982-NMCA-019, 97 N.M. 534, 641 P.2d 1081, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nThe district court erred by failing to comply with the criminal sentencing act for a third-degree felony for a sexual offense against a child.— Where defendant was convicted of attempt to commit second-degree criminal sexual contact of a minor (CSCM), a third degree felony, and where the district court imposed a basic sentence of three years, defendant's basic sentence was an illegal sentence, because the Criminal Sentencing Act mandates that a basic sentence for a third-degree felony shall be three years imprisonment, unless the third-degree felony is a sexual offense against a child, in which case the basic sentence shall be six years imprisonment. Defendant's crime, although incomplete, was a sexual offense against a child.State v. Notah, 2022-NMCA-005, cert. denied.\n\nImprisonment for noncompliance with parole mattersis not a term of imprisonment which can be imposed by sentence, as such imprisonment results only after sentence has been imposed.State v. Gonzales, 1981-NMCA-086, 96 N.M. 556, 632 P.2d 1194.\n\nWhen multiple parole periods commence.— The New Mexico Criminal Sentencing Act (Sections 31-18-12 to 31-18-21 NMSA 1978) requires that in the case of consecutive sentencing, the parole period of each offense commence immediately after the period of imprisonment for that offense, and such parole time will run concurrently with the running of any subsequent basic sentence then being served.Brock v. Sullivan, 1987-NMSC-013, 105 N.M. 412, 733 P.2d 860.\n\nThe defendant, convicted of a fourth-degree felony and a misdemeanor, was sentenced consecutively to 18 months imprisonment for the felony and 364 days for the misdemeanor. The court erred in requiring him to serve his parole period after the completion of the entire sentence, 18 months and 364 days, instead of allowing him to begin his parole after the term for the felony had expired and concurrently with the term for the misdemeanor.Gillespie v. State, 1988-NMSC-068, 107 N.M. 455, 760 P.2d 147.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of five counts of forgery in one case and seven felonies in a subsequent case,and was sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment, the parole period for defendant's first sentence, since it is deemed part of the sentence, commenced immediately after the period of imprisonment for the first offense and ran concurrently with the running of the subsequent basic sentence being served which would also require a period of parole following the subsequent sentence.State v. Ortiz, 2015-NMCA-020, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nLesser charge against codefendant provides no basis for relief.— The fact that defendant was sentenced to the term authorized by law provides no basis for post-conviction relief where defendant asserts that \"codefendants\" were sentenced for a fourth-degree felony on the basis of \"the same identical act,\" and that the state had reduced the charge to a fourth-degree felony on one codefendant.State v. Follis, 1970-NMCA-083, 81 N.M. 690, 472 P.2d 655.\n\nSentence upon two charges arising out of same transaction.— Under former law, which required that the term of imprisonment \"shall not exceed the maximum nor be less than the minimum fixed by law,\" where appellant was sentenced for both rape and assault with intent to commit rape, both charges arose out of the same transaction, were committed at the same time as part of a continuous act, and were inspired by the same criminal intent which was an essential element of each offense, and, accordingly, were susceptible of only one punishment.State v. Blackwell, 1966-NMSC-088, 76 N.M. 445, 415 P.2d 563.\n\nConsecutive and concurrent sentences.— Where 1969 sentences were expressly made consecutive to 1967 sentences, and eight sentences in 1969 were also expressly made consecutive, these nine consecutive sentences were validly imposed.Deats v. State, 1972-NMCA-155, 84 N.M. 405, 503 P.2d 1183.\n\nPeriod of parole is to be in addition to basic sentenceand is considered a part of the sentence of the convicted person.State v. Johnson, 1980-NMCA-083, 94 N.M. 636, 614 P.2d 1085, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 674, 615 P.2d 991.\n\nThere is no restriction placed upon period of paroleexcept that it be for a reasonable period of time consistent with the needs of the individual.State v. Johnson, 1980-NMCA-083, 94 N.M. 636, 614 P.2d 1085, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 674, 615 P.2d 991.\n\nHomicide by vehicle.— Even though Section 66-8-101 NMSA 1978 does not include the language \"resulting in the death of a human being,\" the crime of homicide by vehicle is subject to the six-year sentence authorized by Subsection A(4).State v. Guerro, 1999-NMCA-026, 126 N.M. 699, 974 P.2d 669, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 533, 972 P.2d 352.\n\nIssuing a worthless check over $25.00.— The offense of issuing a worthless check over $25.00 is a \"felony\" but could not constitute a \"fourth degree felony\" because the minimum sentence imposed for issuing worthless checks is less than the stated sentence for fourth degree felonies.State v. Muzio, 1987-NMCA-006, 105 N.M. 352, 732 P.2d 879, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 358, 732 P.2d 1381.\n\nVoluntary manslaughter with firearm enhancement.— Upon conviction of voluntary manslaughter, with firearm enhancement, imposition of a three-year sentence under 30-2-3 NMSA 1978, plus an additional three-year sentence under this section, and an additional one-year firearm enhancement, did not result in multiple punishments for the same offense in violation of double jeopardy.State v. Alvarado, 1997-NMCA-027, 123 N.M. 187, 936 P.2d 869, cert. denied, 123 N.M. 168, 936 P.2d 337.\n\nDistrict judge may not alter judgment after issuance of commitment.— In the absence of an adjudication by the supreme court to the contrary, it is the opinion that a district judge is without authority to change, alter or amend a judgment after issuance of commitment to the penitentiary. 1959 Op.

      "heading": "Alteration of basic sentence; mitigating or aggravating circumstances; procedure.",
      "text": "A. The court shall hold a sentencing hearing to determine if mitigating or aggravating circumstances exist and take whatever evidence or statements it deems will aid it in reaching a decision to alter a basic sentence. The judge may alter the basic sentence as prescribed in Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978 upon:\n\n(1) a finding by the judge of any mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense or concerning the offender; or\n\n(2) a finding by a jury or by the judge beyond a reasonable doubt of any aggravating circumstances surrounding the offense or concerning the offender.\n\nB. When the determination of guilt or innocence for the underlying offense is made by a jury, the original trial jury shall determine whether aggravating circumstances exist. If the offender waives a jury trial for the underlying offense, the offender retains the right to a jury determination of aggravating circumstances. If the offender waives a jury determination of aggravating circumstances, the basic sentence may be altered upon a finding by the judge beyond a reasonable doubt of any aggravating circumstances surrounding the offense or concerning the offender.\n\nC. For the purpose of this section, the following shall not be considered aggravating circumstances:\n\n(1) the use of a firearm, as provided in Section 31-18-16 NMSA 1978;\n\n(2) a prior felony conviction, as provided in Section 31-18-17 NMSA 1978;\n\n(3) the commission of a crime motivated by hate, as provided in the Hate Crimes Act [31-18B-1 NMSA 1978]; or\n\n(4) any evidence relating to the proof of an essential element of the offense.\n\nD. Not less than five days prior to trial or a sentencing proceeding pursuant to a plea agreement, the state shall give notice that it intends to seek an increase to an offender's basic sentence based upon aggravating circumstances. The notice shall state the aggravating circumstances upon which the sentence increase is sought.\n\nE. Presentation of evidence or statements regarding an alleged aggravating circumstance shall be made as soon as practicable following the determination of guilt or innocence.\n\nF. If the judge determines to alter the basic sentence, the judge shall issue a brief statement of reasons for the alteration and incorporate that statement in the record of the case.\n\nG. The amount of the alteration of the basic sentence for noncapital felonies shall be determined by the judge. However, in no case shall the alteration exceed one-third of the basic sentence; provided that when the offender is a serious youthful offender or a youthful offender, the judge may reduce the sentence by more than one-third of the basic sentence.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 31-18-15.1, enacted by Laws 1979, ch. 152, § 2; 1993, ch. 77, § 6; 2009, ch. 163, § 1.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection A, in the first sentence, after \"reaching a decision\", added \"to alter a basic sentence\"; in Paragraph (1) of Subsection A, after \"any mitigating\" deleted \"or aggravating\" and after \"concerning the offender\", deleted \"If the court determines to alter the basic sentence, it shall issue a brief statement of reasons for the alteration and incorporate that statement in the record of the case\"; added Paragraph (2) of Subsection A; deleted former Subsection B, which provided that the judge shall not consider the use of a firearm or prior felony convictions as aggravating circumstances: and added Subsections B through F.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, added the language beginning \"provided, that\" at the end of Subsection C.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nThe trial court has authority under Sections 31-18-15 and 31-18-15.1 NMSA 1978 to alter the basic sentence of life imprisonmentfor noncapital felonies if the court finds any mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense or concerning the offender.State v. Juan, 2010-NMSC-041, 148 N.M. 747, 242 P.3d 314.\n\nMethod for calculating one-third of a basic sentence of life imprisonment.— The thirty-year term for parole eligibility is the proper numerical standard by which to measure the trial court's authority to alter a basic sentence of life imprisonment under Sections 31-18-15 and 31-18-15.1 NMSA 1978. Because the trial court's alteration cannot exceed one-third of the basic sentence, the trial court lacks authority to reduce a defendant's parole eligibility by more than ten years.State v. Juan, 2010-NMSC-041, 148 N.M. 747, 242 P.3d 314.\n\nConsideration of mitigating circumstances in alteration of basic life sentence.— Where defendant was convicted of child abuse resulting in the death of a child under twelve years of age which carried a basic sentence of life imprisonment, the trial court had authority to reduce defendant's parole eligibility by up to ten years, resulting in a sentence of twenty years of imprisonment before the possibility of parole, and the court improperly failed to consider mitigating evidence at defendant's sentencing hearing.State v. Juan, 2010-NMSC-041, 148 N.M. 747, 242 P.3d 314.\n\nThe trial court has authority to alter the basic sentence of all noncapital felonies.— Sections 31-18-15 and 31-18-15.1 NMSA 1978 explicitly grant the trial court the authority to alter the basic sentence for all noncapital felonies, including those that carry a basic life sentence of life imprisonment.State v. Montoya, 2015-NMSC-010.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of intentional child abuse resulting in the death of a child under twelve, which carried a basic sentence of life imprisonment, and where the district court believed that the law required a mandatory life sentence, the trial court abused its discretion when it misunderstood its authority and obligation to consider mitigating circumstances.State v. Montoya, 2015-NMSC-010.\n\nA basic sentence of life imprisonment is subject to mitigation.— Unlike a capital felony, a basic sentence of life imprisonment for a noncapital felony is not a mandatory life sentence and is subject to mitigation.State v. Cabezuela, 2015-NMSC-016.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of intentional child abuse resulting in the death of a child under twelve, defendant was found guilty of a noncapital felony, and as a result, the life sentence was basic, not mandatory, and the district court was required to consider mitigation evidence before issuing a final sentence.State v. Cabezuela, 2015-NMSC-016.\n\nThis section is facially unconstitutional.State v. Frawley, 2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\nDuty to consider mitigating circumstances.— The district court has a duty to consider mitigating factors in sentencing. Failure to do so, whether based on a misapprehension of the authority given by statute or a belief that a formal motion was required, is an abuse of discretion.State v. Sotelo, 2013-NMCA-028, 296 P.3d 1232, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of kidnapping; at defendant's sentencing hearing, defense counsel argued that the district court had discretion to suspend a portion of defendant's sentence; the district court determined that under Section 31-20-3 NMSA 1978, the court did not have authority to suspend or defer sentences for first degree felonies; defense counsel failed to file a motion mitigating circumstances and informed the court that defense counsel agreed that the court did not have authority to suspend or defer sentences for first degree felonies; and the court did not consider any mitigating evidence before sentencing defendant, the court abused its discretion because the court had a duty to consider mitigating factors in sentencing.State v. Sotelo, 2013-NMCA-028, 296 P.3d 1232, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-001.\n\nA defendant has a right to a jury determination of the factsthat would support enhancement of this sentence.State v. King, 2007-NMCA-130, 142 N.M. 699, 168 P.3d 1123, cert. quashed, 2007-NMCERT-011, 143 N.M. 157, 173 P.3d 764.\n\nWaiver of right of jury trial.— Where the defendant was not informed of acts that would constitute sufficient evidence of aggravating circumstances when he entered into a plea agreement, the defendant's waiver of his right to a jury trial in the plea agreement was not a voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to a jury trial on the sentence enhancement factors.State v. King, 2007-NMCA-130, 142 N.M. 699, 168 P.3d 1123, cert. quashed, 2007-NMCERT-011, 143 N.M. 157, 173 P.3d 764.\n\nSentence enhancement.— The enhancement of defendant's basic sentence by the court pursuant to Section 31-18-15.1 NMSA 1978 violated defendant's right to an impartial jury because the enhancement should have been based on findings by a jury using the reasonable doubt standard.State v. Bounds, 2007-NMCA-062, 141 N.M. 651, 159 P.3d 1136, cert. quashed, 2008-NMCERT-001, 143 N.M. 399, 176 P.3d 1131.\n\nSection constitutional.— This section does not violate the doctrine of separation of powers.State v. Wilson, 1982-NMCA-019, 97 N.M. 534, 641 P.2d 1081, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nThis section is constitutional.State v. Lopez, 2005-NMSC-036, 138 N.M. 521, 123 P.3d 754,overruled byState v. Frawley, 2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\nThis section is not unconstitutionally vague.State v. Segotta, 1983-NMSC-092, 100 N.M. 498, 672 P.2d 1129.\n\nThere is no double jeopardy in considering the circumstances of both the felony and the offender in determining whether the basic sentence should be altered.State v. Wilson, 1982-NMCA-019, 97 N.M. 534, 641 P.2d 1081, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nThe sentence enhancements under this section are constitutional in light ofBlakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004) and United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).State v. Jernigan, 2006-NMSC-003, 139 N.M. 1, 127 P.3d 537.\n\nNo due process concern where sentence not altered.— Where the trial court did not alter the defendant's basic sentence upward or downward as a result of aggravating circumstances, there is no need to consider whether the defendant's sentencing invokes due process concerns relating to the presentation of those aggravating circumstances.State v. Gardner, 2003-NMCA-107, 134 N.M. 294, 76 P.3d 47, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 179, 74 P.3d 1071.\n\nLegislature establishes criminal penalties and determines court's sentencing authority.— The legislature establishes criminal penalties; the trial court's authority to sentence is that which has been provided by law.State v. Wilson, 1982-NMCA-019, 97 N.M. 534, 641 P.2d 1081, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nLegislative intent.— The legislature did not intend to confer a right to a basic sentence but rather to limit the trial court's discretion to punish within a range by taking into consideration a wide range of circumstances, and to provide for meaningful appellate review.State v. Lopez, 2005-NMSC-036, 138 N.M. 521, 123 P.3d 754,overruled byState v. Frawley, 2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\nMultiple enhancements permitted.— In the absence of the type of \"dual use\" (i.e., when the same fact is used both as an element of the crime and a subsequent enhancement or as the basis for two separate enhancements) discussed inState v. Keith, 1985-NMCA-012, 102 N.M. 462, 697 P.2d 145, cert. denied, 102 N.M. 492, 697 P.2d 492 and its progeny, the legislature has authorized both enhancements under the basic sentencing statute and on the finding of aggravating circumstances.State v. McDonald, 2003-NMCA-123, 134 N.M. 486, 79 P.3d 830,aff'd, 2004-NMSC-033, 136 N.M. 417, 99 P.3d 667.\n\nState v. Wilson, 2001-NMCA-032, 130 N.M. 319, 24 P.3d 351 can no longer be considered controlling authorityregarding sentencing enhancements of basic sentences.State v. Frawley, 2005-NMCA-017, 137 N.M. 18, 106 P.3d 580,overruled byState v. Lopez, 2005-NMSC-036, 138 N.M. 521, 123 P.3d 754,overruled by2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\nSection concerns sentences for felony convictions.— This section concerns only the alteration of the basic sentences for felony convictions. There is no rule or statute in the district or magistrate courts specifically requiring the court to provide defendants in misdemeanor cases the right to speak before sentence is pronounced.State v. Stenz, 1990-NMSC-026, 109 N.M. 536, 787 P.2d 455, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 562, 787 P.2d 842.\n\nApplication to youthful offenders.— The basic sentences prescribed by Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978 are \"mandatory\" within the meaning of Section 32A-2-20D NMSA 1978, while the alterations in the basic sentences allowed by this section are discretionary and, therefore, circumscribed by the Children's Code (Section 32A-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.); thus, the maximum sentence that may be imposed upon a youthful offender convicted of a non-capital felony is the basic sentence, plus, if applicable, the enhancements prescribed by Sections 31-18-16 and 31-18-16.1 NMSA 1978.State v. Guerra, 2001-NMCA-031, 130 N.M. 302, 24 P.3d 334, cert. deniedsub nom. State v. Ruby G., 130 N.M. 459, 26 P.3d 103.\n\nOffender not subject to both felony DWI provision and aggravation statute.— The maximum sentence for felony DWI under Section 66-8-102(G) NMSA 1978 cannot be enhanced by the aggravation provisions of this section.State v. Coyazo, 2001-NMCA-018, 130 N.M. 428, 25 P.3d 267, cert. denied, 130 N.M. 254, 23 P.3d 929.\n\nAggravated battery provision and this section not in conflict.— Section 30-3-5 NMSA 1978 (aggravated battery) and this section do not provide punishment for the same offense, and these sections are not in conflict.State v. Wilson, 1982-NMCA-019, 97 N.M. 534, 641 P.2d 1081, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nRelation to Section 31-18-16 NMSA 1978.— The defendant was charged with the use of a firearm in the murder of a police officer, and the jury found that he did use a firearm in committing that crime. Section 31-18-16 NMSA 1978 provided a separate and distinct basis (use of a firearm) for further altering his basic sentence in addition to the alteration for aggravating circumstances permitted by this section: the language and requirements of each statute were totally independent of the other.State v. Hall, 1987-NMCA-145, 107 N.M. 17, 751 P.2d 701, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 16, 751 P.2d 700.\n\nII. PROCEDURAL MATTERS.\n\nFailure to preserve issue.— Where the district court altered defendant's sentence; during the pendency of defendant's appeal, the supreme court held that sentence alteration, based on a judge's finding, is unconstitutional; and defendant raised the constitutionality of the alteration of defendant's sentence for the first time on appeal, defendant failed to preserve the issue.State v. Clements, 2009-NMCA-085, 146 N.M. 745, 215 P.3d 54, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 362, 223 P.3d 359.\n\nSubmission of 192 supportive letters for victim had not rendered the sentencing proceeding unfair.State v. Aker, 2005-NMCA-063, 137 N.M. 561, 113 P.3d 384, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-005, 137 N.M. 522, 113 P.3d 345.\n\nCrime circumstances and offender background.— This section provides for broad inquiry into the circumstances of the crime and the background of the offender.Reyes v. Quintana, 853 F.2d 784 (10th Cir. 1988).\n\nIncreasing sentence based on consideration of element of offense.— Where defendant noted that physical injury is an element of the crime of second degree criminal sexual penetration under Section 30-9-11B(2) NMSA 1978, and he contended the trial court's consideration of the physical injury suffered by the victim in increasing the basic sentence pursuant to this section exposed him to double jeopardy, the court's consideration of circumstances surrounding an element of the offense did not expose defendant to double jeopardy.State v. Bernal, 1987-NMCA-075, 106 N.M. 117, 739 P.2d 986, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 81, 738 P.2d 1326.\n\nNotice of state's intent to seek aggravation.— A defendant must be given notice of the state's intention to seek aggravation and of the aggravating circumstances on which it intends to rely, unless the circumstance was itself an element of the underlying offense or a fact used to establish such an element. While the court may rely upon aggravating circumstances not urged by the state, the court should also provide notice to the defendant of those circumstances that were not established at trial under the foregoing exception.Caristo v. Sullivan, 1991-NMSC-088, 112 N.M. 623, 818 P.2d 401.\n\nDefendant was not prejudiced by late filing of the state's written notice where it reserved its right to seek aggravation in a plea agreement and filed written notice of its intent to do so in open court during the sentencing hearing one month later, and where defendant was on notice of the aggravating factors because they were among the circumstances forming the basis of the charges on which he was indicted.State v. Tortolito, 1997-NMCA-128, 124 N.M. 368, 950 P.2d 811, cert. denied, 124 N.M. 311, 950 P.2d 284.\n\nIntent of writing requirement.— The writing requirement of Subsection A of this section was intended to limit the judge's sentencing discretion by imposing a standard of reasonableness, rather than creating a right in defendants to be sentenced to the basic sentence.State v. Lopez, 2005-NMSC-036, 138 N.M. 521, 123 P.3d 754,overruled by2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\nStatement of reasons for alteration.— Appellate review would have been easier if the trial court had filed, as part of the court file, a written statement of its reasons for alteration of a basic sentence, but a taped statement preserved for review was part of the appellate record because it was included in the transcript.State v. Bernal, 1987-NMCA-075, 106 N.M. 117, 739 P.2d 986, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 81, 738 P.2d 1326.\n\nThe factors the trial judge stated were permissible considerations, and his statement was sufficient under subsection A, where the court, by its statement after evidence and argument, indicated that it considered: (1) testimony of a psychologist that defendant could be a \"power\" rapist, that defendant's drinking triggered violent and aggressive behavior, and that the court had no guarantee or expectation that his alcohol abuse could be controlled, and (2) evidence that defendant's action was \"brutal\" in nature, and the court emphasized it had a duty to protect society and that it could not risk defendant being unable to control alcohol abuse.State v. Bernal, 1987-NMCA-075, 106 N.M. 117, 739 P.2d 986, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 81, 738 P.2d 1326.\n\nCourt must specify aggravating circumstances.— Case was remanded for a new sentencing hearing on defendant's convictions for kidnapping, criminal sexual penetration, and robbery, where the trial court found the existence of aggravating circumstances, but did not specify what those circumstances were.State v. McGuire, 1990-NMSC-067, 110 N.M. 304, 795 P.2d 996.\n\nThe preferred practice is for a sentencing judge to note the factors argued in mitigation and indicate whether they are outweighed by any aggravating factors; however, a sentencing judge is not required to make detailed, exhaustive findings or cite every claim or nuance advanced.State v. Watchman, 1991-NMCA-010, 111 N.M. 727, 809 P.2d 641, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 529, 807 P.2d 227,overruled in part on other grounds byState v. Hosteen, 1996-NMCA-084, 122 N.M. 228, 923 P.2d 595.\n\nPresumption as to motive in imposing sentence.— When a sentencing judge enhances a sentence based upon circumstances factually supported in the record, and those circumstances constitute proper factors to consider under the enhancement statute, this court will not presume improper motive in imposing sentence.Reyes v. Quintana, 853 F.2d 784 (10th Cir. 1988).\n\nJudge's increase of the sentence of a defendant charged with first degree murder, based on defendant's pursuit of the victim, is not tantamount to basing the increase on a finding of deliberate intention to kill, an element of first degree murder, and is not violative of the double jeopardy clause.Reyes v. Quintana, 853 F.2d 784 (10th Cir. 1988).\n\nCircumstances surrounding each element of offense may be considered.— The elements of an offense do no more than establish the offense. The circumstances surrounding the offense, including the circumstances surrounding each of the elements of the offense, may be considered under this section.State v. Wilson, 1982-NMCA-019, 97 N.M. 534, 641 P.2d 1081, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nSentencing hearing is mandatory.State v. Tomlinson, 1982-NMCA-025, 98 N.M. 337, 648 P.2d 795,aff'd, 98 N.M. 213, 647 P.2d 415.\n\nThe Criminal Sentencing Act does not require bifurcation.— Where defendant was charged with two counts of criminal sexual penetration (CSP), and where defendant claimed that he was denied his right to a fair trial because the Criminal Sentencing Act requires a determination of a defendant's guilt or innocence before the jury can consider whether the crime included aggravating circumstances, and that a sentencing hearing is a separate and distinct proceeding from trial, requiring bifurcation, defendant was not denied a fair trial, because while a sentencing hearing is mandatory under the Criminal Sentencing Act, it does not necessarily require a separate proceeding as long as defendant is given the opportunity to present mitigating considerations and the district court is given the opportunity to hear whatever evidence or statements it deems will aid it in reaching a decision.State v. Apodaca, 2021-NMCA-001, cert. granted.\n\nDefendant must be given opportunity to speak before sentence pronounced.— This section extends the common-law doctrine of allocutus to noncapital felonies, as enumerated in Secton 31-18-15 NMSA 1978, and the trial judge must give the defendant an opportunity to speak before he pronounces sentence; failure to do so renders the sentence invalid.Tomlinson v. State, 1982-NMSC-074, 98 N.M. 213, 647 P.2d 415.\n\nThe district judge must give a defendant an opportunity to speak before sentence is rendered.State v. Pothier, 1986-NMSC-039, 104 N.M. 363, 721 P.2d 1294.\n\n\"Statement\" before trial court for the purpose of this section is presentence report.State v. Wilson, 1982-NMCA-019, 97 N.M. 534, 641 P.2d 1081, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nStatutory compliance where evidence taken, reasoning articulated and defendant given chance to comment.— Where, without the assistance of counsel, the trial court takes evidence it deems would aid it, articulates its reasoning and gives defense counsel a chance to comment, this section is complied with.State v. Tomlinson, 1982-NMCA-025, 98 N.M. 337, 648 P.2d 795,aff'd, 1982-NMSC-074, 98 N.M. 213, 647 P.2d 415.\n\nDefendant's right to allocutionwas not denied when the trial court refused to grant a continuance for sentencing until her psychologist could testify; the court gave her the opportunity to make a proffer as to the expert's testimony, which she did, and she did not allege that the expert's testimony would be different from that given at trial.State v. Setser, 1997-NMSC-004, 122 N.M. 794, 932 P.2d 484.\n\nDenial of right to allocution rendered sentence invalid.— Where defendant and the state entered into a plea and disposition agreement in which defendant agreed to plead guilty to possession of a controlled substance in two cases, and where the plea and disposition agreement contained no agreement as to sentencing, but where the state did not oppose the sentences in the two cases being suspended and running concurrently, and where, at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced defendant within the statutory maximum punishment, and where, on appeal, defendant claimed that his cases should be remanded for resentencing because the district court did not afford him the opportunity to allocute prior to sentencing, and where the state claimed that by entering into a plea and disposition agreement, defendant waived his right to raise the allocution violation on appeal, defendant's sentence was not authorized by statute, because the Criminal Sentencing Act plainly mandates that the opportunity for allocution be provided at every felony sentencing proceeding, and that a court's failure to afford this right renders the sentence unauthorized by statute, a jurisdictional defect that may be raised on appeal notwithstanding the entry of a valid guilty plea and appellate waiver.State v. Wing, 2022-NMCA-016, cert. denied.\n\nImpermissible to increase sentence if state failed to include \"mitigation\" language in sentence.— The use of the state's failure to include \"mitigation\" language in the judgment and sentence in order to later increase the defendant's sentence is impermissible. The proper remedy is to file an amended judgment and sentence containing the appropriate language.State v. Sisneros, 1981-NMCA-085, 98 N.M. 279, 648 P.2d 318,aff'd, 1984-NMSC-085, 101 N.M. 679, 687 P.2d 736,overruled on other grounds byState v. Saavedra, 1988-NMSC-100, 108 N.M. 38, 766 P.2d 298.\n\nProper aggravated battery sentence not made erroneous by superfluous reference to another offense.— Having stated his reason for altering the basic sentence for felony aggravated battery, the altered sentence is not made erroneous by the court's superfluous reference to another offense.State v. Wilson, 1982-NMCA-019, 97 N.M. 534, 641 P.2d 1081, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nSentences served concurrently unless trial court or legislature requires consecutive sentences.— The trial court has discretion to require sentences to be served consecutively, but if this is not done, and there is no legislation covering the situation, the sentences are to be served concurrently.State v. Mayberry, 1982-NMCA-061, 97 N.M. 760, 643 P.2d 629.\n\nIII. AGGRAVATING AND MITIGATING FACTORS.\n\nEnhanced sentences invalidated.— Where defendant's basic sentences imposed under Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978 were increased under this section based on the district court's findings of aggravating circumstances, and not based on a jury's findings and under a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the enhancements are invalidated.State v. Frawley, 2005-NMCA-017, 137 N.M. 18, 106 P.3d 580,overruled byState v. Lopez, 2005-NMSC-036, 138 N.M. 521, 123 P.3d 754,overruled byState v. Frawley, 2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\nUse of contemporaneous crime.— A trial court, in considering enhancement, cannot consider the elements of a separate but contemporaneous conviction as an aggravating factor; however, the trial court is free to consider the circumstances surrounding the offense, as long as the court does not rely solely on the elements of the statute necessary to define the crime.State v. Fuentes, 1994-NMCA-158, 119 N.M. 104, 888 P.2d 986, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 168, 889 P.2d 203 (1995).\n\nUse of firearm as permissible aggravating factor.— Because Subsection B (now C) prohibits only the basic use of a firearm from being used as an aggravator, there was no error in the trial court's use of other circumstances involving the type of firearm with its potential for use to create generalized fear and indiscriminate harm.State v. Roper, 2001-NMCA-093, 131 N.M. 189, 34 P.3d 133, cert. quashed, 131 N.M. 619, 41 P.3d 345.\n\nDistrict court improperly aggravated defendant's sentence.— Where defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary with a deadly weapon, conspiracy, three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and three counts of false imprisonment based on evidence that he and two other individuals, armed with guns, entered a home to confront another individual about a romantic entanglement and held three teenagers against their will in anticipation of confronting the romantic rival, and where, at sentencing, the district court applied firearm enhancements, found aggravated circumstances and ultimately sentenced defendant to thirty years in prison, the district court improperly aggravated defendant's sentence, because NMSA 1978, § 31-18-15.1(C)(1) explicitly prohibits the district court from aggravating a sentence based on \"the use of a firearm, as provided in Section 31-18-16,\" and therefore a finding that the defendant \"was armed\" was not an appropriate basis for aggravation under the circumstances.State v. Vasquez, 2024-NMCA-020.\n\nAmount of time spent planning murder.— Use, as an aggravating factor, of the amount of time that defendant spent planning the murder was not inappropriate on the basis that the court was, in substance, punishing him for having engaged in a conspiracy.State v. Castillo-Sanchez, 1999-NMCA-085, 127 N.M. 540, 984 P.2d 787, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 390, 981 P.2d 1208.\n\nAggravating factors for fraud.— Although several of the aggravating factors considered by the court in a fraud case were proper, consideration \"that the money is apparently gone or has been spent\", without more, was a neutral factor and, on remand for resentencing, should not be considered unless the court can spell out why this is an aggravating factor.State v. Whitaker, 1990-NMCA-014, 110 N.M. 486, 797 P.2d 275, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 631, 788 P.2d 931.\n\nProlonged wait for victim, accusatory statement and deliberateness properly considered aggravating circumstances.— The defendant's prolonged wait for the victim, her accusatory statement before she shot the victim and her deliberateness may properly be considered as aggravating and may properly add an additional year to the sentence for aggravated battery.State v. Wilson, 1982-NMCA-019, 97 N.M. 534, 641 P.2d 1081, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nConsideration of false testimony.— A trial judge at sentencing may consider whether the defendant's trial testimony contained willful and material falsehoods; however, the consideration of false testimony is justified only under circumstances guaranteeing its probative value to sentencing for the underlying offense and is subject to minimum safeguards required by due process.State v. James, 1989-NMCA-089, 109 N.M. 278, 784 P.2d 1021, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 262, 784 P.2d 1005.\n\nAge of child victim as aggravating factor.— Where the defendant was charged with rape of a child, criminal sexual contact of a minor, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, the court properly considered the minority of the victims as an aggravating circumstance even though it was an essential element of each crime.State v. Cawley, 1990-NMSC-088, 110 N.M. 705, 799 P.2d 574.\n\nLack of remorsearguably is a circumstance \"concerning the offender,\" and, thus, is a permissible factor in sentencing.Swafford v. State, 1991-NMSC-043, 112 N.M. 3, 810 P.2d 1223.\n\nBecause the court did not express concern about suspected perjury, and because the court considered the defendant's lack of remorse over a long period of time in a variety of situations, the trial court did not err by using lack of remorse as an aggravating circumstance.State v. Wilson, 1993-NMCA-074, 117 N.M. 11, 868 P.2d 656 , cert. quashed, 119 N.M. 311, 889 P.2d 1233 (1995).\n\nFuture dangerousness.— Trial court had sufficient basis to aggravate defendant's sentence based on both his lack of remorse and future dangerousness to the victim and an eye witness as based on psychologist's report and testimony describing defendant's conduct.State v. Fike, 2002-NMCA-027, 131 N.M. 676, 41 P.3d 944, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 737, 42 P.3d 842,overruled byState v. Frawley, 2007-NMSC-057, 143 N.M. 7, 172 P.3d 144.\n\nEvents surrounding crime and nature of defendant's threat to society.— Findings that the defendant had numerous opportunities to avoid the auto collision and did not put on his brakes at all before striking the victim's car provided an adequate basis for aggravation of the defendant's sentences for vehicular homicide.State v. Landgraf, 1996-NMCA-024, 121 N.M. 445, 913 P.2d 252, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 375, 911 P.2d 883.\n\nImpermissible aggravating factor.— While the victim's blood relationship to defendant arguably was a circumstance surrounding the offense of criminal sexual penetration, it was error for the court to consider such relationship as an aggravating factor at sentencing on a criminal sexual penetration count after defendant had also been convicted of incest.Swafford v. State, 1991-NMSC-043, 112 N.M. 3, 810 P.2d 1223.\n\nThis section does not by its own terms permit the trial judge to consider the elements of either the offense for which the defendant was sentenced or a separate, but contemporaneous, conviction as an aggravating factor.Swafford v. State, 1991-NMSC-043, 112 N.M. 3, 810 P.2d 1223.\n\nHarm to wife to force alibi testimony.— There is no direct or circumstantial evidence that would support consideration of harm to the defendant's wife as an aggravating circumstance. The evidence in the record required speculation about the defendant's role in inducing the alibi and the exculpatory letters, and the evidence involved conduct not directly related to the defendant's dangerousness or candidacy for rehabilitation.State v. Wilson, 1993-NMCA-074, 117 N.M. 11, 868 P.2d 656, cert. quashed, 119 N.M. 311, 889 P.2d 1233 (1995).\n\nDefendant's cooperation with authorities.— A sentencing judge may take into account as a mitigating factor a defendant's voluntary cooperation with authorities. However, a sentence may not be increased based upon a defendant's failure to cooperate.State v. Callaway, 1989-NMCA-094, 109 N.M. 564, 787 P.2d 1247,rev'd on other grounds, 1990-NMSC-010, 109 N.M. 416, 785 P.2d 1035, cert. denied, 496 U.S. 912, 110 S. Ct. 2603, 110 L. Ed. 2d 283 (1990).\n\nTrial court's offer to cut defendant's sentence in half if he provided information pertaining to another individual involved in the crime was a permissible extension of an offer of leniency to the defendant.State v. Callaway, 1989-NMCA-094, 109 N.M. 564, 787 P.2d 1247,rev'd on other grounds, 1990-NMSC-010, 109 N.M. 416, 785 P.2d 1035, cert. denied, 496 U.S. 912, 110 S. Ct. 2603, 110 L.

      "text": "A. An alleged serious youthful offender may be detained in any of the following places, prior to arraignment in metropolitan, magistrate or district court:\n\n(1) a detention facility for delinquent children, licensed by the children, youth and families department;\n\n(2) any other suitable place, other than a facility for the care and rehabilitation of delinquent children, that meets standards for detention facilities, as set forth in the Children's Code [Chapter 32A NMSA 1978] and federal law; or\n\n(3) a county jail, if a facility described in Paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection is not appropriate.\n\nB. When an alleged serious youthful offender is detained in a juvenile detention facility prior to trial, the time spent in the juvenile detention facility shall count toward completion of any sentence imposed.\n\nC. At arraignment, when a metropolitan or district court judge or a magistrate determines that an alleged serious youthful offender should remain in custody, the alleged serious youthful offender may be detained in an adult or juvenile detention facility, subject to the facility's accreditation and the provisions of applicable federal law.\n\nD. When an alleged serious youthful offender is found guilty of first degree murder, the court shall sentence the offender pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Sentencing Act; provided that a serious youthful offender given an adult sentence shall not be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole. The court may sentence the offender to less than, but not exceeding, the mandatory term for an adult. The determination of guilt becomes a conviction for purposes of the Criminal Sentencing Act.\n\nE. Prior to the sentencing of an alleged serious youthful offender who is convicted of first degree murder, adult probation services shall prepare a presentence report and submit the report to the court and the parties five days prior to the sentencing hearing.\n\nF. When the alleged serious youthful offender is convicted of a lesser offense than first degree murder, the court shall provide for disposition of the offender pursuant to the provisions of Section 32A-2-19 or 32A-2-20 NMSA 1978. When an offender is adjudicated as a delinquent child, the conviction shall not be used as a conviction for purposes of the Criminal Sentencing Act.\n\nHistory:Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 3; 2023, ch. 24, § 1.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, prohibited the imposition of a sentence of life without the possibility of release or parole on a serious youthful offender given an adult sentence; in Subsection D, added \"provided that a serious youthful offender given an adult sentence shall not be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole\"; and in Subsection F, after \"Section\", deleted \"32-2-19 or 32-2-20\" and added \"32A-2-19 or 32A-2-20\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2023, ch. 24, § 5 provided that the provisions of Laws 2023, ch. 24 apply retroactively to all offenders currently serving an adult sentence for an offense committed as a child.\n\nConstitutionality of excluding serious youthful offenders convicted of first-degree felony murder from receiving an amenability hearing.— Where defendant was charged and convicted of three counts of first-degree felony, murder and conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary, based on evidence that defendant, who was sixteen years old at the time, killed three members of a family with a pickaxe after he and two co-conspirators planned to burglarize the family in order to get money, and where, prior to sentencing, defendant filed a motion arguing that the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and the constitutional guarantee of equal protection require an amendability hearing in conjunction with the court's sentencing, defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by being sentenced without an amenability hearing, because cruel and unusual punishment jurisprudence does not guarantee an amenability hearing to juveniles simply because they are juveniles, and defendant failed to show that the legislature's statutory distinction is unsupported by a firm rationale or evidence in the record.State v. Ortiz, 2021-NMSC-029.\n\nPre-sentence report is mandatory.— The district court does not have jurisdiction to sentence a youthful offender who has been convicted of first degree murder until a pre-sentence report has been prepared by adult probation services and the report has been submitted to the district court and the parties five days prior to the sentencing hearing.State v. Gutierrez, 2011-NMSC-024, 150 N.M. 232, 258 P.3d 1024.\n\nAmenability to treatment.— Subsection F of this section gives the district court the discretion to impose an adult sentence as indicated in Section 32A-2-20 NMSA 1978 based on a finding that a child is not amenable to treatment. If the district court finds the child is amenable to treatment, then the district court should impose a juvenile disposition in accordance with 32A-2-19 NMSA 1978.State v. Muniz, 2003-NMSC-021, 134 N.M. 152, 74 P.3d 86,superceded by statute,State v. Jones, 2010-NMSC-012, 148 N.M. 1, 229 P.3d 474.\n\nChildren initially charged with first degree murder,but found guilty of lesser crimes, may be sentenced as adults under Subsection F of this section if the district court finds that circumstances warrant such a sentence, even when those children are found guilty of crimes that would otherwise warrant only a juvenile disposition.State v. Muniz, 2003-NMSC-021, 134 N.M. 152, 74 P.3d 86,superceded by statute,State v. Jones, 2010-NMSC-012, 148 N.M. 1, 229 P.3d 474.\n\nApplication to delinquent offenders.— The presentence confinement credit provided for in Sections 31-18-15.3 and 31-20-12 NMSA 1978 applies only to serious youthful offenders sentenced as adults, and not to a child adjudicated as a delinquent offender for a lesser-included offense.State v. Nanco, 2012-NMCA-109, 288 P.3d 527, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-010.\n\nPresentence confinement credit does not apply to delinquent offenders.— Where the child, who was fifteen years old, was charged with committing first degree murder and two counts of tampering with evidence, and the jury determined that the child had committed the delinquent acts of voluntary manslaughter and one count with tampering with evidence, the child was not entitled to presentence confinement credit for the twenty-five months the child was detained in a juvenile detention facility before the district court adjudicated the child a delinquent offender.State v. Nanco, 2012-NMCA-109, 288 P.3d 527, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-010.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"State v. Muniz: Authorizing Adult Sentencing of Juveniles Absent a Conviction that Authorizes an Adult Sentence\", see 35 N.M.L. Rev. 229 (2005).",

As used in this section, \"public official\" means a person elected to an office in an election covered by the Campaign Reporting Act [1-19-25 to 1-19-36 NMSA 1978] or a person appointed to an office that is subject to an election covered by that act.\n\nHistory:Laws 2012, ch. 3, § 1.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2012, ch. 3 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M.

When a separate finding of fact by the court or jury shows that a firearm was used in relation to a drug transaction or during the commission of aggravated burglary pursuant to Section 30-16-4 NMSA 1978 or a serious violent offense, the basic sentence of imprisonment prescribed for the offense in Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978 shall be increased by one year, except that when the offender is a serious youthful offender or a youthful offender who received an adult sentence, the sentence imposed by this subsection may be increased by one year.\n\nB. When a separate finding of fact by the court or jury shows that a firearm was brandished in the commission of a noncapital felony, the basic sentence of imprisonment prescribed for the offense in Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978 shall be increased by three years, except that when the offender is a serious youthful offender or a youthful offender that received an adult sentence, the sentence imposed by this subsection may be increased by one year.\n\nC. When a separate finding of fact by the court or jury shows that a firearm was discharged in the commission of a noncapital felony, the basic sentence of imprisonment prescribed for the offense in Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978 shall be increased by five years, except that when the offender is a serious youthful offender or a youthful offender who received an adult sentence, the sentence imposed by this subsection may be increased by three years.\n\nD. For a second or subsequent offense, when a separate finding of fact by the court or jury shows that a firearm was used, brandished, or discharged in relation to a drug transaction or during the commission of aggravated burglary pursuant to Section 30-16-4 NMSA 1978 or a serious violent offense, the sentence shall be increased by five years, except that when the offender is a serious youthful offender or a youthful offender, the sentence imposed by this section may be increased by three years.\n\nE. If the case is tried before a jury and if a prima facie case has been established showing that a firearm was used, brandished or discharged in relation to a drug transaction or during the commission of aggravated burglary pursuant to Section 30-16-4 NMSA 1978 or a serious violent offense, the court shall submit the issue to the jury by special interrogatory. If the case is tried by the court, the court shall decide the issue and shall make a separate finding of fact thereon.\n\nF. When a separate finding of fact by the court or jury shows that a firearm was used, brandished or discharged in relation to a drug transaction or during the commission of aggravated burglary pursuant to Section 30-16-4 NMSA 1978 or a serious violent offense, the firearm is subject to seizure and forfeiture as an instrumentality pursuant to the provisions of the Forfeiture Act [Chapter 31, Article 27 NMSA 1978].\n\nG. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"brandished\" means displaying or making a firearm known to another person while the firearm is present on the person of the offending party with intent to intimidate or injure a person;\n\n(2) \"in relation to a drug transaction\" means participating or attempting to participate in the trafficking of a controlled substance pursuant to Section 30-31-20 NMSA 1978, distribution of a controlled substance to a minor pursuant to Section 30-31-21 NMSA 1978 or distribution of a controlled or counterfeit substance pursuant to Section 30-31-22 NMSA 1978 as a seller, purported seller or as an accomplice; and\n\n(3) \"serious violent offense\" means an offense enumerated in Subparagraphs (a) through (n) of Paragraph (4) of Subsection L of Section 33-2-34 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-29-29, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 216, § 5; 1979, ch. 152, § 3; 1993, ch. 77, § 7; 2020, ch. 54, § 3; 2022, ch. 56, § 30.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective May 18, 2022, provided for a sentencing enhancement when a firearm is used during the commission of a drug transaction or serious violent offense, and provided that if a firearm is used during the commission of a drug transaction or serious violent offense, the firearm is subject to seizure; added a new Subsection A and redesignated former Subsection A as Subsection B; deleted former Subsection B, added new Subsections C and D and redesignated former Subsection C as Subsection E; in Subsection E, after \"showing that a firearm was\", added \"used\", after \"brandished\", deleted \"in the commission of the offense\" and added \"or discharged in relation to a drug transaction or during the commission of aggravated burglary pursuant to Section 30-16-4 NMSA 1978 or a serious violent offense\", and after \"tried by the court\", deleted \"and if a prima facie case has been established showing that a firearm was brandished in the commission of the offense\"; added a new Subsection F and redesignated former Subsection D as Subsection G; and in Subsection G, added Paragraphs G(2) and G(3).\n\nThe 2020 amendment,effective July 1, 2020, increased the sentence enhancements for brandishing of a firearm in the commission of a noncapital felony, and defined \"brandished\" as used in this section; in the section heading, and throughout the section, substituted \"brandished\" for \"used\"; in Subsection A, after \"shall be increased by\", deleted \"one year and the sentence imposed by this subsection shall be the first served\" and added \"three years, except\"; in Subsection B, after \"shall be increased by\", deleted \"three\" and added \"five\", and after \"years\", deleted \"and the sentence imposed by this subsection shall be the first three years served, and shall not be suspended or deferred; provided\" and added \"except\"; and added Subsection D.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, added the provisos at the end of Subsections A and B.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nIntent of statuteis to deter the use of firearms in committing felonies.State v. Trujillo, 1978-NMCA-041, 91 N.M. 641, 578 P.2d 342, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 751, 580 P.2d 972.\n\nSection directed at sentencing only.— This section is, by its own terms and in actual application, directed at sentencing only.Cordova v. Romero, 614 F.2d 1267 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 851, 101 S. Ct. 142, 66 L. Ed. 2d 63 (1980).\n\nThis section does not create new class of crimes;rather, it provides for additional consequences for felonies committed by use of a firearm.Cordova v. Romero, 614 F.2d 1267 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 851, 101 S. Ct. 142, 66 L. Ed. 2d 63 (1980).\n\nThere is no repugnancy between 30-16-2 NMSA 1978 and this section.— Subsection B of this section does not conflict with Section 30-16-2 NMSA 1978 when it provides that the first year of the statutory sentence shall not be suspended. The two statutes are in harmony; each expresses a separate legislative intent.State v. Wilkins, 1975-NMCA-069, 88 N.M. 116, 537 P.2d 1012, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 319, 540 P.2d 249.\n\nCombined use of sections creates no new crime.— No new crime is created by the combined use of Section 30-16-2 NMSA 1978 and this section in an indictment. Section 30-16-2 NMSA 1978 defines robbery with a deadly weapon, the crime of which defendant was convicted. This section specifies various consequences for the defendant if a finding is made that the deadly weapon used in the robbery was, in fact, a firearm, and serves no other purpose in the indictment than to alert the defendant to the possible sentencing consequences following a conviction under Section 30-16-2 NMSA 1978.State v. Sanchez, 1974-NMCA-144, 87 N.M. 140, 530 P.2d 404.\n\nSection mandatory.— The enhancement provisions of this section are mandatory.State v. Kendall, 1977-NMCA-002, 90 N.M. 236, 561 P.2d 935,rev'd on other grounds,Kendall v. State, 1977-NMSC-015, 90 N.M. 191, 561 P.2d 464.\n\nSentence enhancement provisions for use of firearm mandatory.State v. Pendley, 1979-NMCA-036, 92 N.M. 658, 593 P.2d 755.\n\nThe provisions of this section were mandatory in a robbery case where a special finding was made by the jury that a firearm was used.State v. Wilkins, 1975-NMCA-069, 88 N.M. 116, 537 P.2d 1012, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 319, 540 P.2d 249.\n\nFirearm enhancement statute authorizes multiple punishments for the commission of a noncapital felony with a firearm.— Where defendant was convicted of two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and where defendant's sentences on these counts were each enhanced by one year, defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy was not violated, because 31-18-16(A) NMSA 1978 authorizes multiple punishments for the commission of a noncapital felony with a firearm, and where a legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment under two statutes, regardless of whether those two statutes proscribe the same conduct under Blockburger, a court may impose cumulative punishment under such statutes in a single trial.State v. Baroz, 2017-NMSC-030.\n\nSentence enhancements for committing aggravated battery and aggravated assault with a firearm.— Double jeopardy was not violated where the sentences for defendant's aggravated battery and aggravated assault convictions were each increased by the firearm enhancement, because the legislature intended to authorize greater punishment when a firearm is used in the commission of aggravated assault and aggravated battery.State v. Comitz, 2019-NMSC-011.\n\nFirearm enhancements to convictions for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon do not violate double jeopardy.— Where defendant was convicted of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon for shooting and injuring his son and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon because his wife was standing next to their son at the time of the shooting, defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated when the district court enhanced defendant's sentence based on the use of a firearm during the commission of the crimes, because the legislature intended to authorize an enhanced punishment when a firearm is used in the commission of a noncapital felony.State v. Branch, 2018-NMCA-031,replacing2016-NMCA-071, 387 P.3d 250, cert. denied.\n\nFirearm enhancements to convictions for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon violate double jeopardy.— Where defendant was convicted of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon for shooting and injuring his son and for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for assaulting his wife, who was standing next to defendant's son when he was shot, double jeopardy was violated because the firearm enhancements are subsumed within the underlying offenses, and punishment cannot be had for both the enhancements and the enhanced offenses.State v. Branch, 2016-NMCA-071, 387 P.3d 250,replaced by2018-NMCA-031, and cert. quashed.\n\nApplication not prohibited by double jeopardy provisions.— Neither the rules of statutory construction nor the federal and state constitutional provisions against double jeopardy prohibit the application of the firearm enhancement statute to a person convicted of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon when the weapon used was a firearm.State v. Gonzales, 1981-NMCA-023, 95 N.M. 636, 624 P.2d 1033,overruled on other grounds byBuzbee v. Donnelly, 1981-NMSC-097, 96 N.M. 692, 634 P.2d 1244.\n\nNo double jeopardy in aggravated assault application.— Double jeopardy did not prohibit the trial court from enhancing defendant's sentence for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (Section 30-3-2A NMSA 1978), under this section, since each section contains an element or elements not included in the other and the phrase \"a noncapital felony\" means \"any noncapital felony\".State v. Charlton, 1992-NMCA-124, 115 N.M. 35, 846 P.2d 341, cert. denied, 114 N.M. 577, 844 P.2d 827.\n\nJudgment suspending firearm enhancement provision of original sentence void, and later resentencing constitutional.— Since a judgment purporting to suspend a firearm enhancement provision of an original sentence is void, where the defendant is not sentenced to serve any time of official confinement, he cannot be said to have served any portion thereof and he cannot be held to have accrued a right to a credit against the enhanced portion of his sentence as later imposed. Double jeopardy does not attach, and a resentencing for the mandatory enhancement provision of this section must stand.State v. Aguilar, 1982-NMCA-116, 98 N.M. 510, 650 P.2d 32, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 478, 649 P.2d 1391.\n\nRelation to Section 31-18-15.1 NMSA 1978.— The defendant was charged with the use of a firearm in the murder of a police officer, and the jury found that he did use a firearm in committing that crime. This section provided a separate and distinct basis (use of a firearm) for further altering his basic sentence in addition to the alteration for aggravating circumstances permitted by Section 31-18-15.1 NMSA 1978: the language and requirements of each statute were totally independent of the other.State v. Hall, 1987-NMCA-145, 107 N.M. 17, 751 P.2d 701, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 16, 751 P.2d 700.\n\nIt is solely within province of legislature to establish penalties for criminal behavior.State v. Lack, 1982-NMCA-111, 98 N.M. 500, 650 P.2d 22, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 478, 649 P.2d 1391.\n\nII. PROCEDURAL MATTERS.\n\nPunishment to be applied for each felony committed.— If this section punishes for \"use\" of a firearm in committing a felony, the punishment is to be applied for each felony committed by using a firearm.State v. Kendall, 1977-NMCA-002, 90 N.M. 236, 561 P.2d 935,rev'd on other grounds,Kendall v. State, 1977-NMSC-015, 90 N.M. 191, 561 P.2d 464.\n\nApplication to some, not all, of crimes charged.— The trial court did not err in applying this section to two of the crimes which the defendant committed, rather than applying one firearm enhancement sentence to his entire series of crimes.State v. Espinosa, 1988-NMSC-050, 107 N.M. 293, 756 P.2d 573.\n\nNotification to defendant.— Under this section, the prosecution does not have to formally notify a defendant in a charging instrument of either firearm use or that the state may seek a firearm enhanced sentence.State v. Badoni, 2003-NMCA-009, 133 N.M. 257, 62 P.3d 348, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 126, 61 P.3d 835.\n\nSection requires separate finding of fact that firearm was used.— Where the jury did not make a separate finding of fact as to use of a firearm, the enhanced sentence under this section was not proper.State v. Duran, 1977-NMCA-091, 91 N.M. 35, 570 P.2d 39, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 3, 569 P.2d 413, cert. denied, 435 U.S. 972, 98 S. Ct. 1615, 56 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1978).\n\nObjection to absence of separate finding not waived.— Defendant did not waive his objection to the absence of a separate finding of fact by failing to request that the special interrogatory be submitted to the jury, as it was not defendant's obligation to see that his sentence was enhanced.State v. Duran, 1977-NMCA-091, 91 N.M. 35, 570 P.2d 39, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 3, 569 P.2d 413, cert. denied, 435 U.S. 972, 98 S. Ct. 1615, 56 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1978).\n\nUse of firearm must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.— Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the traditional burden which our system of criminal justice deems essential, and the due process clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged; this standard applies not only to factual determinations of guilt, but also to the factual determination that a firearm was used, because that fact is a predicate for enhancing defendant's sentence.State v. Kendall, 1977-NMCA-002, 90 N.M. 236, 561 P.2d 935,rev'd on other grounds,Kendall v. State, 1977-NMSC-015, 90 N.M. 191, 561 P.2d 464.\n\nFailure to instruct as to burden of proof.— Where the burden of proof instruction, by its wording, was applied to a determination of guilt, no reference was made to use of a firearm, and after the guilty verdicts were returned, instructions were given submitting the use of a firearm issue to the jury without a burden of proof instruction, the jury was not instructed on the burden of proof concerning use of a firearm; however, defendant did not complain of the absence of an instruction, he acquiesced in submitting only use instructions after a guilty verdict was returned, the evidence was almost uncontradicted that a firearm was used as to each count, and, accordingly, there was no violation of federal due process because the jury was not instructed that the firearm use must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.State v. Kendall, 1977-NMCA-002, 90 N.M. 236, 561 P.2d 935,rev'd on other grounds,Kendall v. State, 1977-NMSC-015, 90 N.M. 191, 561 P.2d 464.\n\nPrior conviction required.— For there to be a second or subsequent felony within the terms of the statute, there must have been a conviction preceding the commission of the offense to which application of the statute is sought.State v. Garcia, 1978-NMSC-039, 91 N.M. 664, 579 P.2d 790.\n\nProper to enhance sentences under both habitual offender and firearm enhancement provisions.— It is not improper to enhance a sentence under the general habitual offender statute if it has already been enhanced under the firearm enhancement statute.State v. Reaves, 1982-NMCA-169, 99 N.M. 73, 653 P.2d 904.\n\nFailure to enhance felony sentences as required.— Where the defendant was convicted of three counts, the trial court failed to follow the habitual offender statute when it enhanced defendant's total sentence by one year, because the habitual offender statute required the court to enhance each of defendant's current felony sentences by one year.State v. Bachicha, 1991-NMCA-014, 111 N.M. 601, 808 P.2d 51, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 529, 807 P.2d 227.\n\nIII. SENTENCES.\n\nService of a mandatory sentence under house arrest.— The mandatory firearm enhancement of a one-year term of imprisonment set forth in Subsection A of Section 31-18-16 NMSA 1978 may be served under house arrest by an electronic monitor under the supervision of state or local law enforcement or correctional officers if the defendant is subject to being punished for a crime of escape for an unauthorized departure from the place of confinement or other non-compliance with the sentencing court's order.State v. Woods, 2010-NMCA-017, 148 N.M. 89, 230 P.3d 836, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-001, 147 N.M. 673, 227 P.3d 1055.\n\nSentence to house arrest.— Where defendant, who was a state park ranger, fatally shot the victim during a confrontation, and defendant pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter resulting in the death of a human being with a mandatory firearm enhancement, the district court had authority to sentence defendant to house arrest by electronic monitor with global positioning system capability and work release to satisfy the mandatory sentence of imprisonment for one year.State v. Woods, 2010-NMCA-017, 148 N.M. 89, 230 P.3d 836, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-001, 147 N.M. 673, 227 P.3d 1055.\n\nSentences served concurrently unless trial court or legislature requires consecutive sentences.— The trial court has discretion to require sentences to be served consecutively, but if this is not done, and there is no legislation covering the situation, the sentences are to be served concurrently.State v. Mayberry, 1982-NMCA-061, 97 N.M. 760, 643 P.2d 629.\n\nSection does not negate enhanced sentence for accessory.— This section is worded in terms of a finding of fact \"that a firearm was used in the commission\" of the crime, but the statutory wording does not limit the enhanced sentence to situations where the defendant was the user of the firearm. Thus, the statute does not negate an enhanced sentence for an accessory when a firearm was used by the principal.State v. Roque, 1977-NMCA-094, 91 N.M. 7, 569 P.2d 417, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 4, 569 P.2d 414;State v. Burdex, 1983-NMCA-087, 100 N.M. 197, 668 P.2d 313, cert. denied, 100 N.M. 192, 668 P.2d 308.\n\nConcurrent or consecutive sentences.— The trial court has authority to order that a sentence be served concurrently or consecutively, and this section made no change in this authority.State v. Kendall, 1977-NMCA-002, 90 N.M. 236, 561 P.2d 935,rev'd on other grounds,Kendall v. State, 1977-NMSC-015, 90 N.M. 191, 561 P.2d 464.\n\nThe trial court has the discretion to order that sentences for different offenses be served concurrently or consecutively.State v. Lopez, 1983-NMCA-045, 99 N.M. 612, 661 P.2d 890.\n\nNew consecutive sentence following remand allowable where less than maximum possible penalty.— A new sentence imposed by the trial court following remand does not constitute a punishment for the defendant having previously exercised his rights to appeal where the term of incarceration ordered upon remand is less than the maximum penalty which can be imposed, despite the fact part of the new sentence is to be served consecutively, rather than concurrently.State v. Lopez, 1983-NMCA-045, 99 N.M. 612, 661 P.2d 890.\n\nSentences cannot be served concurrently.— An additional one-year sentence for the use of a firearm and an additional one-year sentence as an habitual offender cannot be served concurrently.State v. Mayberry, 1982-NMCA-061, 97 N.M. 760, 643 P.2d 629.\n\nIV. SPECIFIC CASES.\n\nUse of noncapital felonies to enhance a capital felony.— Where defendant was convicted of first degree murder, a capital felony, the district court erred in enhancing defendant's sentence for the use of a firearm in the commission of the offense, because the enhancement for the use of a firearm applied only to noncapital felonies.State v. Serna, 2013-NMSC-033.\n\n\"Use\" of gun properly included within scope of statute.— The display of a gun in a menacing manner as a means of accomplishing a robbery or the employment of the gun to strike or \"pistol whip\" the victim is certainly \"use\" of the gun in the commonly accepted definition of that term. Because either such \"use,\" i.e., the menacing display of or striking the victim with the gun, carries the ever-dangerous potential of a discharge of firearm, both such \"uses\" are properly included within the scope of the statute.State v. Trujillo, 1978-NMCA-041, 91 N.M. 641, 578 P.2d 342, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 751, 580 P.2d 972.\n\nShotgun used as club.— Defendant \"used\" the firearm within the meaning of the statute when he used the shotgun as a club in committing aggravated battery.State v. Trujillo, 1978-NMCA-041, 91 N.M. 641, 578 P.2d 342, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 751, 580 P.2d 972.\n\nPossession of firearm not \"use\" of firearm.— Possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony does not constitute \"use\" of a firearm under this section since the defendant never pulled the firearm or in any way threatened to use it.State v. Chouinard, 1979-NMCA-145, 93 N.M. 634, 603 P.2d 744.\n\nNo enhancement for charge of negligent use of firearm.— Under the facts of this case, the state was required to prove that the defendant negligently used a firearm to commit a noncapital felony and this conduct resulted in the death of a human being. Use of a firearm is thus the same conduct required to enhance defendant's sentence under Subsection A. Because the state would not be required to prove any additional facts in order to have the defendant's sentence enhanced, the firearm enhancement statute is subsumed within the offense of involuntary manslaughter by negligent use of a firearm.State v. Franklin, 1993-NMCA-135, 116 N.M. 565, 865 P.2d 1209.\n\nConspiracy not susceptible to firearm enforcement.— Since conspiracy is an initiatory crime which involves no physical act other than communication, it is not conceivable how a firearm could be used in the commission of that offense. Accordingly, the crime of conspiracy is not susceptible to firearm enhancement under this section.State v. Padilla, 1994-NMCA-067, 118 N.M. 189, 879 P.2d 1208.\n\nLaw reviews.— For survey, \"Evidence: Prior Crimes and Prior Bad Acts Evidence,\" see 6 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. A person convicted of a noncapital felony in this state whether within the Criminal Code [Chapter 30 NMSA 1978] or the Controlled Substances Act [Chapter 30, Article 31 NMSA 1978] or not who has incurred one prior felony conviction that was part of a separate transaction or occurrence or conditional discharge under Section 31-20-13 NMSA 1978 is a habitual offender and his basic sentence shall be increased by one year. The sentence imposed pursuant to this subsection shall not be suspended or deferred, unless the court makes a specific finding that the prior felony conviction and the instant felony conviction are both for nonviolent felony offenses and that justice will not be served by imposing a mandatory sentence of imprisonment and that there are substantial and compelling reasons, stated on the record, for departing from the sentence imposed pursuant to this subsection.\n\nB. A person convicted of a noncapital felony in this state whether within the Criminal Code or the Controlled Substances Act or not who has incurred two prior felony convictions that were parts of separate transactions or occurrences or conditional discharge under Section 31-20-13 NMSA 1978 is a habitual offender and his basic sentence shall be increased by four years. The sentence imposed by this subsection shall not be suspended or deferred.\n\nC. A person convicted of a noncapital felony in this state whether within the Criminal Code or the Controlled Substances Act or not who has incurred three or more prior felony convictions that were parts of separate transactions or occurrences or conditional discharge under Section 31-20-13 NMSA 1978 is a habitual offender and his basic sentence shall be increased by eight years. The sentence imposed by this subsection shall not be suspended or deferred.\n\nD. As used in this section, \"prior felony conviction\" means:\n\n(1) a conviction, when less than ten years have passed prior to the instant felony conviction since the person completed serving his sentence or period of probation or parole for the prior felony, whichever is later, for a prior felony committed within New Mexico whether within the Criminal Code or not, but not including a conviction for a felony pursuant to the provisions of Section 66-8-102 NMSA 1978; or\n\n(2) a prior felony, when less than ten years have passed prior to the instant felony conviction since the person completed serving his sentence or period of probation or parole for the prior felony, whichever is later, for which the person was convicted other than an offense triable by court martial if:\n\n(a) the conviction was rendered by a court of another state, the United States, a territory of the United States or the commonwealth of Puerto Rico;\n\n(b) the offense was punishable, at the time of conviction, by death or a maximum term of imprisonment of more than one year; or\n\n(c) the offense would have been classified as a felony in this state at the time of conviction.\n\nE. As used in this section, \"nonviolent felony offense\" means application of force, threatened use of force or a deadly weapon was not used by the offender in the commission of the offense.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-29-30, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 216, § 6; 1979, ch. 158, § 1; 1983, ch. 127, § 1; 1993, ch. 77, § 9; 1993, ch. 283, § 1; 2002, ch. 7, § 1; 2003, ch. 90, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For procedure and sentencing,see31-18-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor time period within which habitual criminal offender proceeding must be commenced,seeRule 5-604 NMRA.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective March 28, 2003, inserted \"but not including a conviction for a felony pursuant to the provisions of Section 66-8-102 NMSA 1978\" near the end of Paragraph D(1).\n\nThe 2002 amendment,effective July 1, 2002, deleted former Subsection A defining \"prior felony conviction\" and redesignated the following subsections accordingly; updated the internal references in Subsections A, B, and C; added the last sentence in present Subsection A; and added Subsections D and E.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, inserted \"or conditional discharge under Section 31-20-7 NMSA 1978\" in Subsections B through D. This section was also amended by Laws 1993, ch. 77, § 9, effective July 1, 1993. The section was set out as amended by Laws 1993, ch. 283, § 1.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978. Section 31-20-7 was compiled as 31-20-13 to avoid confusion with the repealed 31-20-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nUse of noncapital felonies to enhance a capital felony.— Where defendant was convicted of first degree murder, a capital felony, the district court erred in enhancing defendant's sentence for being a habitual offender, because the enhancement for being a habitual offender applied only to noncapital felonies.State v. Serna, 2013-NMSC-033.\n\nEnhancement based on parole violation.— Pursuant to defendant's plea agreement, defendant was convicted of nine property offenses and received basic sentences that ran consecutively, two of the sentences were enhanced based on two prior felony convictions; defendant agreed that the remaining sentences would be subject to habitual offender enhancement upon a violation of law or a violation of a condition of parole or probation; defendant violated the conditions of parole for one of the offenses that had been fully enhanced under the plea agreement; the district court found that defendant was an habitual offender and enhanced each of the seven sentences that had not been enhanced under the plea agreement; and there was nothing in the plea agreement that provided that a parole violation applied only to the offense underlying the parole, the district court properly enhanced defendant's sentences for the seven convictions that had not been enhanced under the plea agreement based on the parole violation.State v. Triggs, 2012-NMCA-068, 281 P.3d 1256.\n\nSection 31-18-17 NMSA 1978 does not apply for a first degree murder conviction.State v. Paiz, 2011-NMSC-008, 149 N.M. 412, 249 P.3d 1235.\n\nProof of prior conviction.— Where defendant raised the issue at the time of sentencing and the plea agreement did not satisfy the elements for a prior felony conviction, the state must make its prima facie showing that a prior conviction meets the definition of \"prior felony conviction\" under Section 31-18-17 NMSA 1978. The state has the burden of proving identity, conviction, and timing. State v. Simmons, 2006-NMSC-044, 140 N.M. 311, 142 P.3d 899.\n\nTen year limitation.— The ten-year limitation in Section 31-18-17D NMSA 1978 does not apply to the robbery statute.State v. Torres, 2006-NMCA-106, 140 N.M. 230, 141 P.3d 1284, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-008.\n\nConviction beyond ten-year limitation.— Where defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder, the trial court erred in enhancing defendant's sentence pursuant to the habitual offender statute, because more than ten years had elapsed between defendant's discharge on his prior felony conviction and the date of actual conviction of the current offense.State v. Torres, 2018-NMSC-013.\n\nAllocution.— The right of the defendant to say why sentence should not be pronounced on the defendant before the trial judge pronounces sentence applies to habitual offender sentencing.State v. Leyba, 2009-NMCA-030, 145 N.M. 712, 204 P.3d 37, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-002, 145 N.M. 704, 204 P.3d 29.\n\nThe controlling date for calculating the ten-year period from which prior convictions can be usedto enhance the defendant's sentence is the date of the defendant's current felony conviction for which the sentence is being imposed.State v. Tave, 2007-NMCA-059, 141 N.M. 571, 158 P.3d 1014, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-005, 141 N.M. 762, 161 P.3d 259.\n\nConstitutional provision inapplicable.— Because the Habitual Offender Act was not repealed, N.M. Const., art. IV, § 33, does not apply to the 2002 amendment to this section or to the interpretation of the amendment through 12-2A-16 NMSA 1978.State v. Shay, 2004-NMCA-077, 136 N.M. 8, 94 P.3d 8, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-002, 137 N.M. 266, 110 P.3d 74.\n\nApplication of 2002 amendment.— The date a sentence is imposed is the appropriate date to determine whether the 2002 amendment to this section applies to a given case.State v. Shay, 2004-NMCA-077, 136 N.M. 8, 94 P.3d 8, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-002, 137 N.M. 266, 110 P.3d 74.\n\nThe 2002 amendment to this section does not apply to defendant's sentence for a probation violation when the original sentence was imposed prior to the amendment's effective date under a plea agreement.State v. Ortega, 2004-NMCA-080, 135 N.M. 737, 93 P.3d 758, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-006, 135 N.M. 787, 93 P.3d 1292.\n\nWhere the district court accepted a plea agreement and entered sentence prior to July 1, 2002, and the sentence included a suspended sentence and probation, but after a probation violation, the district court ordered the basic sentence to be served as well as a habitual offender enhancement for a prior felony conviction that would not have been included for enhancement purposes under the 2002 amendment, because the district court had imposed sentence prior to July 1, 2002, based on the plea agreement, it properly applied this section.State v. Ortega, 2004-NMCA-080, 135 N.M. 737, 93 P.3d 758, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-006, 135 N.M. 787, 93 P.3d 1292.\n\nEffect of 2002 amendment constitutionally precluded.— N.M. Const., art. IV, § 34 precludes the effect of the 2002 amendment to the habitual offender statute, when a supplemental criminal information is filed before, and defendant is sentenced after, the July 1, 2002 effective date of the amendment.State v. Stanford, 2004-NMCA-071, 136 N.M. 14, 94 P.3d 14.\n\nNew rule applied retroactively disqualified prior burglary conviction from being used to enhance sentence.— Where defendant was charged and convicted of felony burglary in 2010, and where, in 2015, defendant was again charged and convicted of numerous offenses, and where the state sought to enhance defendant's 2015 sentence pursuant to the Habitual Offender Act, § 31-18-17 NMSA 1978, relying on defendant's 2010 felony conviction, and where defendant claimed that his 2010 burglary conviction should not be used to enhance his 2015 sentence, based on the New Mexico supreme court's decision inState v. Office of Public Defender ex rel. Muqqddin, 2012-NMSC-029, which held for the first time that the act of penetrating a vehicle's gas tank and removing gas therefrom did not constitute burglary under § 30-16-3 NMSA 1978, the district court erred in determining defendant to be a habitual offender as alleged by the State and enhancing defendant's sentence in the 2015 case, becauseMuqqddinannounced a new rule that altered the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes, and should therefore be applied retroactively.State v. Wood, 2022-NMCA-009.\n\nIt is solely within province of legislature to establish penalties for criminal behavior.State v. Lack, 1982-NMCA-111, 98 N.M. 500, 650 P.2d 22, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 478, 649 P.2d 1391.\n\nApplication to Controlled Substances Act.— In 1983 the habitual offender statute was amended to include persons convicted of narcotics offenses, overruling that part ofState v. Lujan, 1966-NMSC-051, 76 N.M. 111, 412 P.2d 405, which held that the Habitual Offender Act did not apply to persons convicted under the Controlled Substances Act (Section 30-31-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.).Minner v. Kerby, 30 F.3d 1311 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\nAlthough the habitual offender statute applies to a prior felony conviction under the Controlled Substances Act, Sections 30-31-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., it does not apply if there is a conditional discharge under Section 30-31-28 NMSA 1978.State v. Fairres, 2003-NMCA-152, 134 N.M. 668, 81 P.3d 611, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-003, 135 N.M. 51, 84 P.3d 668.\n\nThe Habitual Offender Act is applicable to convictions of felony battery against a household member.— Where defendant pleaded guilty to battery against a household member after battering the mother of his child, and where this was defendant's third conviction of battery against a household member, and where the district court enhanced defendant's conviction to a fourth degree felony under § 30-3-17(A) NMSA 1978, and where defendant had previously been convicted of a separate felony, the district court enhanced defendant's sentence by one year under the Habitual Offender Act, § 31-18-17 NMSA 1978, the district court did not err in applying the Habitual Offender Act, because the plain language of § 30-3-17(A) NMSA 1978 and § 31-18-17 NMSA 1978 does not preclude their simultaneous application.State v. Barela, 2021-NMSC-001,aff'g2019-NMCA-005, 458 P.3d 501.\n\nApplication to felony battery against a household member.— Where defendant, a three-time domestic violence offender, pleaded no contest to, and was convicted of, felony battery against a household member pursuant to 30-3-17 NMSA 1978, the district court did not err in enhancing defendant's sentence by one year, pursuant to 31-18-17(A) NMSA 1978, based on a prior conviction for false imprisonment, because contrary to defendant's argument, the felony battery against a household member statute is not self-enhancing, and based on the plain language of the statutes at issue, the one-year habitual offender enhancement of defendant's fourth degree felony battery on a household member sentence was proper as a matter of law.State v. Barela, 2019-NMCA-005, cert. granted.\n\nIntent of habitual criminal provisions.— Object of habitual offender statute is to inhibit repetition of criminal acts by individuals against the peace and dignity of the state. It is designed to protect society against habitual offenders.State v. Baldonado, 1968-NMCA-025, 79 N.M. 175, 441 P.2d 215.\n\nIt is inherent in the habitual criminal statutes that, after punishment is imposed for the commission of a crime, the increased penalty is held in terrorem over the criminal for the purpose of effecting his reformation and preventing further and subsequent offenses by him, so that for the purpose of this section, each felony must have been committed after conviction for a preceding felony.State v. Montoya, 1979-NMCA-044, 92 N.M. 734, 594 P.2d 1190,aff'd, 1980-NMSC-093, 94 N.M. 704, 616 P.2d 417;State v. Linam, 1979-NMSC-004, 93 N.M. 307, 600 P.2d 253;State v. Rogers, 1979-NMSC-085, 93 N.M. 519, 602 P.2d 616.\n\nThe intent of habitual offender laws is to provide an increased penalty in order to deter commission of a subsequent offense. It is the opportunity to reform under threat of a more severe penalty which serves to deter.State v. Linam, 1979-NMSC-004, 93 N.M. 307, 600 P.2d 253, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 846, 100 S. Ct. 91, 62 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1979).\n\nThis section is not an ex post facto lawsince it is procedural in nature. It does not punish criminals for earlier offenses, but merely increases the penalty for the repetition of criminal conduct.State v. Oglesby, 1981-NMCA-070, 96 N.M. 352, 630 P.2d 304.\n\nEnhanced punishment not prohibited as double jeopardy.— Since defendant's first conviction, standing alone, was not the cause of the enhanced sentence of which he complained, defendant's enhanced punishment was not prohibited as double jeopardy.State v. Gonzales, 1972-NMCA-130, 84 N.M. 275, 502 P.2d 300, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 271, 502 P.2d 296.\n\nThe contention that the habitual offender statute violates double jeopardy is without merit.State v. Olivares, 1980-NMCA-165, 95 N.M. 222, 620 P.2d 380.\n\nBecause the habitual offender proceeding is a sentencing procedure and not a trial of an offense, there is no double jeopardy.State v. James, 1980-NMSC-082, 94 N.M. 604, 614 P.2d 16.\n\nSince the law in New Mexico is that an habitual proceeding only involves sentencing and not the trial of any crime, double jeopardy does not attach to proceedings under this section.State v. Garcia, 1980-NMSC-132, 95 N.M. 246, 620 P.2d 1271.\n\nThe imposition of an enhanced sentence after defendant has already begun serving his sentence on the underlying felony conviction is not violative of constitutional double jeopardy provisions.State v. Oglesby, 1981-NMCA-070, 96 N.M. 352, 630 P.2d 304.\n\nHabitual offender enhancement of an escape conviction does not constitute double jeopardy.State v. Najar, 1994-NMCA-098, 118 N.M. 230, 880 P.2d 327, cert. denied, 118 N.M. 90, 879 P.2d 91.\n\nNew Mexico's habitual offender statute does not multiply punishments for a prior crime, but simply increases the punishment for a new crime. Because sentences enhanced under habitual offender statutes are not punishment for the prior offense, they do not normally raise double jeopardy issues.Yparrea v. Dorsey, 64 F.3d 577 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\nWhen a defendant with two prior felonies was convicted of a third felony and, under a plea agreement, was sentenced as a second offender subject to resentencing as a third offender if he violated the terms of his probation, the enhancement of his sentence as a third offender when he was resentenced following his violation of probation did not violate double jeopardy.State v. Freed, 1996-NMCA-044, 121 N.M. 562, 915 P.2d 325, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 644, 916 P.2d 844.\n\nDefendant, a three-time felony offender, had no reasonable expectation of finality in a three-year probationary sentence for a larceny conviction; therefore, it was not a violation of his double jeopardy rights for the state to seek a subsequent conviction of defendant, during the probationary period, under the habitual offender laws.State v. Villalobos, 1998-NMSC-036, 126 N.M. 255, 968 P.2d 766.\n\nNo reasonable expectation of finality.— Where defendant pleaded no contest to aggravated battery causing great bodily harm and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, receiving a three-year sentence on the battery charge and a one and one-half-year sentence on the assault charge, and where the trial judge suspended three years of defendant's total sentence and ordered defendant to be placed on supervised probation for three years following release from custody, and where defendant, after being released from prison, violated the conditions of his probation, the district court did not err in enhancing defendant's aggravated battery conviction, because defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of finality as to the aggravated battery charge, because defendant would have expected to serve a three-year period of probation and be subject to additional enhancement of the sentence imposed for the aggravated battery during the entire period of probation.State v. Yazzie, 2018-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nHabitual offender enhancement statute prior to 2002.— Where defendant pleaded no contest and was sentenced for aggravated battery and aggravated assault prior to July 1, 2002, and where, under the judgment and sentence, an eight year habitual offender enhancement was held in abeyance only to be imposed upon a subsequent violation of probation, and where defendant violated his probation in 2013, the district court had continuing jurisdiction to impose the enhancement under the habitual offender statute when defendant violated probation in 2013 for prior convictions occurring in 1992 and earlier, because prior to 2002, the imposition of the habitual offender statute was mandatory in all cases in which there was a prior felony conviction, regardless of the date of the prior conviction.State v. Yazzie, 2018-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nInsufficient evidence is not a bar to retrial of a defendant's habitual offender status.— Following defendant's conviction for battery on a peace officer, where the state filed a supplemental criminal information alleging that defendant was a habitual offender and seeking enhancement of defendant's sentence, and where the state failed to introduce a certified copy of his fingerprint card from the current case, leading the district court to rule that the state's evidence was not sufficient to prove that defendant was the person convicted of the prior felonies as alleged in the supplemental criminal information and to deny the state's request for sentencing enhancement, but where the district court granted the state's request for a second sentencing hearing to address defendant's habitual offender status, during which the district court found that defendant was a habitual offender, the district court did not err in allowing the retrial of defendant's habitual offender status, because sentencing decisions favorable to the defendant cannot be analogized to an acquittal, and insufficient evidence is never a bar to the retrial of a defendant's status as a habitual offender.State v. Salas, 2017-NMCA-057, cert. denied.\n\nTo enhance a defendant's sentence, due process is required.— In order to subject a defendant to a statutory sentencing enhancement, due process requires that the defendant be given notice, that enhancement of sentence is sought by a pleading filed by the state, and an opportunity to be heard before an increased penalty can be imposed.State v. Salas, 2017-NMCA-057, cert. denied.\n\nDefendant was not denied due process in his sentence enhancement.— Where defendant was convicted of battery on a peace officer and where the State filed a supplemental criminal information alleging that defendant was a habitual offender subject to sentence enhancement, requested a special setting for the purpose of conducting a habitual offender hearing, certifying service to defense counsel the same day, and where defendant's motion opposing retrial of his habitual offender status indicated that defendant had actual notice of a subsequent sentencing hearing, defendant was not deprived of an opportunity to be heard, and the state's procedural steps constituted adequate notice.State v. Salas, 2017-NMCA-057, cert. denied.\n\nMultiple uses of prior convictions do not violate double jeopardy.— Where defendant's prior felony convictions were used to establish defendant's status as a habitual offender for sentencing for attempted murder and to serve as the predicate felony for defendant's conviction of felon in possession of a firearm, the double jeopardy clause was not violated.State v. Tafoya, 2012-NMSC-030, 285 P.3d 604.\n\nDelay in filing charge not, in itself, prejudicial.— A due process issue based on a delay in filing a charge involves prejudice that deprives the defendant of a fair trial on the delayed charge. The delay, in itself, does not establish prejudice.State v. Mayberry, 1982-NMCA-061, 97 N.M. 760, 643 P.2d 629.\n\nSupplemental habitual offender charge not dismissed where original sentence not completely served.— Where, at the time a supplemental information is filed, the defendant has not completed serving his original sentence, the filing delay, in relation to time served, does not require a dismissal of an habitual offender charge.State v. Mayberry, 1982-NMCA-061, 97 N.M. 760, 643 P.2d 629.\n\nNo dismissal for delay even where prosecutor originally knew of prior conviction.— Where, before the defendant is convicted for a felony, the prosecutor knows of a prior felony conviction, this knowledge does not require the dismissal of a latter habitual offender charge because of a filing delay.State v. Mayberry, 1982-NMCA-061, 97 N.M. 760, 643 P.2d 629.\n\nDelay in enhancement sentencing constitutional.— Even if the habitual offender proceeding in defendant's case was part of his burglary prosecution, delay of his enhancement sentencing for at least 15 months after he pleaded guilty did not violate his right to a speedy trial.Perez v. Sullivan, 793 F.2d 249 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 936, 107 S. Ct. 413, 93 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1986).\n\nHabitual criminal information does not charge a new offense.— Defendant was not denied due process where, at defendant's sentencing for robbery, the state filed a supplemental habitual offender information charging defendant with a conviction for a petty larceny offense that had occurred more than three years prior to the sentencing for the robbery conviction.Martinez v. Romero, 626 F.2d 807 (10th Cir. 1980) (Decided under former law).\n\nProsecutorial discretion.— A certain measure of discretion is inevitable in the performance of the prosecutorial function and the conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement is not in itself a federal constitutional violation.Martinez v. Romero, 626 F.2d 807 (10th Cir. 1980).\n\nWhen sentence completely served, enhancement improper.— Double jeopardy considerations preclude the enhancement of a defendant's sentence after the defendant has completely served that underlying sentence, no matter when the habitual proceedings were initiated.State v. Gaddy, 1990-NMCA-055, 110 N.M. 120, 792 P.2d 1163.\n\nJurisdiction to enhance sentence prior to expiration of parole.— A parole term is part of a sentence for purposes of a court's sentencing authority; thus, since the defendant had completely served an underlying sentence as of the date of an underlying enhancement proceeding but was still subject to a mandatory one-year parole, the trial court had jurisdiction to enhance his sentence as an habitual offender.State v. Roybal, 1995-NMCA-097, 120 N.M. 507, 903 P.2d 249, cert. denied, 120 N.M. 498, 903 P.2d 240.\n\nNot cruel and unusual punishment.— Although the New Mexico supreme court has held that habitual criminality is a status rather than an offense, the defendant was not convicted of being an habitual criminal but of the commission of a criminal act; he was, therefore, appropriately punished for the commission of that crime by a substituted enhanced sentence as prescribed by statute, and his punishment was not cruel and unusual punishment.State v. Gonzales, 1972-NMCA-130, 84 N.M. 275, 502 P.2d 300, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 271, 502 P.2d 296.\n\nSpecific term may be cruel and unusual punishment.— In extremely limited circumstances, a trial court may determine that a mandatory prison term is constitutionally impermissible under U.S. Const., amend. VIII, and N.M. Const., art. II, § 13.State v. Arrington, 1993-NMCA-055, 115 N.M. 559, 855 P.2d 133.\n\nMandatory incarceration which would have been life-threatening to defendant because her serious medical needs would not have been handled adequately under customary prison practices and because there was no showing that the prison would make special provisions for defendant would have constituted cruel and unusual punishment, allowing the trial court to order defendant to serve the unsuspended portion of her sentence in the custody of her parents.State v. Arrington, 1993-NMCA-055, 115 N.M. 559, 855 P.2d 133.\n\nUneven enforcement in actual practice does not make statute unconstitutional.— That there may, in actual practice, be uneven enforcement of the habitual offender statute does not make the law unconstitutional.State v. Sedillo, 1971-NMCA-003, 82 N.M. 287, 480 P.2d 401.\n\nThe allegation of a \"consistent and invariable administrative practice,\" in not enforcing the law with respect to habitual offenders uniformly, does not bring a case within the purview of the equal protection clause of the constitution.State v. Baldonado, 1968-NMCA-025, 79 N.M. 175, 441 P.2d 215.\n\nConstruction of the phrase \"substantial and compelling\".— A district court's justification for permitting a defendant to avoid an otherwise mandatory sentence of imprisonment must be weighty, and not ethereal, in order to be \"substantial,\" and whether reasons are \"compelling\" depend upon the overall facts of a given case, including the particular criminal behavior the prosecution is designed to address, the history of a given defendant's efforts to comply with what is required of him or her in a law-abiding society, and the court's considerations of the factors in the defendant's life that lend themselves to a possibility of successful rehabilitation in a non-incarcerative environment.State v. Lindsey, 2017-NMCA-048.\n\nCourt did not abuse its discretion in determining that there were substantial and compelling reasons for suspending defendant's sentence.— Where defendant pled no contest to residential burglary and larceny, and where the district court imposed a five-year sentence of imprisonment, which included two mandatory one-year habitual offender enhancements, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that there were substantial and compelling reasons to suspend the mandatory habitual offender portion of defendant's sentence where evidence was presented that defendant had obtained steady employment, which would enable him to pay restitution according to the terms of his prior probation, that defendant was doing well on probation, as reported by his probation officer, and that defendant had demonstrated the existence of a supportive family and his commitment to it.State v. Lindsey, 2017-NMCA-048.\n\nTerms of habitual offender statute are mandatory,and a district attorney or judge, or both, may not nullify the statutes by ignoring them.State v. McCraw, 1955-NMSC-050, 59 N.M. 348, 284 P.2d 670.\n\nMandatory provisions.— The provisions of the Habitual Offender Act are mandatory.State v. Davis, 1986-NMSC-031, 104 N.M. 229, 719 P.2d 807.\n\nAct must be interpreted narrowly.— The habitual offender statute is highly penal in nature, and its application must be interpreted narrowly.State v. Lujan, 1966-NMSC-051, 76 N.M. 111, 412 P.2d 405.\n\nHabitual criminality is a status,not an offense.State v. Cruz, 1971-NMCA-047, 82 N.M. 522, 484 P.2d 364, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324 (1978).\n\nThis section creates no new offense,but merely provides a proceeding by which to determine the penalty to be imposed on one previously convicted in New Mexico of a felony.Lott v. Cox, 1966-NMSC-038, 76 N.M. 76, 412 P.2d 249.\n\nIncrease in penalty not creation of new offense.— The habitual offender statute does not make the conviction of prior felonies the subject of punishment, as such, as a separate offense. It only provides that proof of the conviction of prior felonies increases the penalty to be imposed upon conviction of a subsequent felony in New Mexico. The amount by which such penalty is required to be increased depends upon the number of prior convictions.French v. Cox, 1964-NMSC-236, 74 N.M. 593, 396 P.2d 423.\n\nThe filing of habitual criminal information does not create a new criminal case nor constitute a separate offense. Proof of the conviction of prior felonies merely increases the penalty to be imposed upon conviction of a subsequent felony.Martinez v. Romero, 626 F.2d 807 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1019, 101 S. Ct. 585, 66 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1980).\n\nFiling of habitual criminal information does not create new criminal casenor constitute a separate offense. Proof of the conviction of prior felonies merely increases the penalty to be imposed upon conviction of a subsequent felony in New Mexico.State v. Knight, 1965-NMSC-058, 75 N.M. 197, 402 P.2d 380.\n\nFederal felony convictions arising from the same transaction.— Where defendant was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of Section 31-18-17 NMSA 1978; defendant had a prior 2005 state felony conviction; and defendant had been convicted in 1991 of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841, and carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1), the district court did not err when it used one federal felony conviction to form the predicate felony for the felon in possession charge and the other federal conviction and the 2005 state felony conviction to form the basis for enhancement because the federal felony convictions were separate and distinct felony offenses.State v. May, 2010-NMCA-071, 148 N.M. 854, 242 P.3d 421, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-006, 148 N.M. 582, 241 P.3d 180.\n\nII. PRIOR FELONY CONVICTION.\n\nFederal felony convictions arising from the same transaction.— Where defendant was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of Section 31-18-17 NMSA 1978; defendant had a prior 2005 state felony conviction; and defendant had been convicted in 1991 of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841, and carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1), the district court did not err when it used one federal felony conviction to form the predicate felony for the felon in possession charge and the other federal conviction and the 2005 state felony conviction to form the basis for enhancement because the federal felony convictions were separate and distinct felony offenses.State v. May, 2010-NMCA-071, 148 N.M. 854, 242 P.3d 421, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-006, 148 N.M. 582, 241 P.3d 180.\n\nSufficient evidence of prior conviction.— Where a Texas judgment and sentence report had no birth date, no social security number, no identifying information about the convicted person and stated only that the convicted person's name was \"Jesse Charles Clements\", as opposed to \"Jesse Clements\", as defendant was know in defendant's New Mexico convictions, the report was insufficient to identify defendant as the convicted person.State v. Clements, 2009-NMCA-085, 146 N.M. 745, 215 P.3d 54, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 362, 223 P.3d 359.\n\nSufficient evidence to prove defendant was the person convicted of prior felonies.— Following defendant's conviction for battery on a peace officer, where the district court admitted certified copies of three fingerprint cards, which corresponded to arrests in 2004, 2008, and 2011 and which contained defendant's name, birth date, and social security number, and where the district court also admitted certified copies of judgment and sentencing documents, which indicated that defendant had qualifying convictions, and took judicial notice of a defendant's current conviction, the admitted evidence was sufficient to support a finding that defendant was a habitual offender.State v. Salas, 2017-NMCA-057, cert. denied.\n\nMinor discrepancies in documents used to prove prior conviction.— Minor discrepancies in copies of the judgment and sentence used to prove an earlier felony conviction do not require a finding of insufficiency of the evidence when the fact of the earlier conviction is not otherwise contested.State v. Bailey, 2008-NMCA-084, 144 N.M. 279, 186 P.3d 908, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-005, 144 N.M. 331, 187 P.3d 677.\n\nOut-of-state felony convictions qualified as prior felony convictions for purposes of New Mexico habitual offender statute.— Where defendant was convicted of four counts of battery against a household member and one count of false imprisonment perpetrated against his then-wife, and where the district court sentenced defendant consecutively for each conviction and enhanced defendant's sentence for false imprisonment, the only felony conviction, by eight years under the New Mexico habitual offender statute, and where defendant claimed that two of the three California convictions the district court relied on to enhance his sentence failed to meet the definition of a prior felony conviction for purposes of New Mexico's habitual offender statute, the district court did not err in finding that defendant's 2006 felony conviction qualified as a prior felony conviction, because substantial unrebutted evidence in the record supported the district court's finding that defendant completed his parole for his 2006 conviction less than ten years prior to the instant conviction and defendant failed to present any evidence supporting his claimed invalidity of the state's evidence, and defendant's 2011 felony conviction qualified as a prior felony conviction despite the discharge granted by the California court, because the determination of guilt is the defining factor under New Mexico's habitual offender statute.State v. Johnson, 2024-NMCA-015.\n\nA prior out-of-state misdemeanor conviction may be usedfor the purposes of sentence enhancement when the conviction was either punishable by a maximum of more than one year imprisonment in the state in which it was committed or classified as a felony in New Mexico at the time of conviction.State v. Young, 2007-NMSC-058, 143 N.M. 1, 172 P.3d 138.\n\nPrior out-of-state misdemeanor convictions can be usedto enhance a sentence if the offense was either punishable by a maximum of more than one year imprisonment in the state in which it was committed or would have been classified as a felony in New Mexico at the time of conviction.State v. Moya, 2007-NMSC-027, 141 N.M. 817, 161 P.3d 862,overrulingState v. Moya, 2006-NMCA-103, 140 N.M. 275, 142 P.3d 43.\n\nMistaken identity.— Where the district court inadvertently relied, in part, on the criminal record of defendant's brother to enhance defendant's sentence, the enhancement of defendant's sentence was not supported by substantial evidence.State v. Contreras, 2007-NMCA-045, 141 N.M. 434, 156 P.3d 725, cert. quashed, 2007-NMCERT-011, 143 N.MN. 157, 173 P.3d 764.\n\nConsecutive sentences.— Where defendant was sentenced to serve consecutive sentences on two underlying felonies, defendant has a reasonable expectation of finality in the sentence imposed for each underlying felony and when defendant completed serving his sentence on the first felony, that sentence was not subject to being enhanced, although defendant remained incarcerated on the second felony.State v. Lovato, 2007-NMCA-049, 141 N.M. 508, 157 P.3d 73, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-004, 141 N.M. 568, 158 P.3d 458.\n\nPlea agreement silent on enhancement.— Where defendant's plea agreement was silent on the issue of habitual-offender proceedings and notwithstanding numerous opportunities to do so, defendant failed to object to being charged as a habitual offender, the evidence showed that defendant never had any expectation of finality in his original sentence that was imposed pursuant to the plea agreement and defendant's enhanced sentence did not violate defendant's double jeopardy rights.State v. Trujillo, 2007-NMSC-017, 141 N.M. 451, 157 P.3d 16.\n\nDiscretion of district court.— In 2002, the legislature amended this section to allow the district court some discretion in imposing the habitual enhancement to cases in which there is one prior felony conviction.State v. Shay, 2004-NMCA-077, 136 N.M. 8, 94 P.3d 8, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-002, 137 N.M. 266, 110 P.3d 74.\n\nLegislature limited definition of \"prior felony conviction\"in its 2003 amendment to the habitual offender statute.State v. Shay, 2004-NMCA-077, 136 N.M. 8, 94 P.3d 8, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-002, 137 N.M. 266, 110 P.3d 74.\n\nApplying 12-2A-16C NMSA 1978 to the 2002 amendment to this section, the 2002 amendment effectively reduces the potential enhanced penalties for violating felony statutes by narrowing the definition of \"prior felony conviction\".State v. Shay, 2004-NMCA-077, 136 N.M. 8, 94 P.3d 8, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-002, 137 N.M. 266, 110 P.3d 74.\n\nPrior conviction must be separate transaction.— Each prior felony conviction must be part of a \"separate transaction or occurrence\".State v. Peppers, 1990-NMCA-057, 110 N.M. 393, 796 P.2d 614, 110 N.M. 260, 794 P.2d 734.\n\nMeaning of \"convicted\".— \"Convicted\", as ordinarily used in legal phraseology as indicating a particular phase of a criminal prosecution, includes the establishing of guilt whether by accused's admission in open court by plea of guilty to the charges presented, or by a verdict or finding of a court or jury.State v. Larranaga, 1967-NMSC-047, 77 N.M. 528, 424 P.2d 804.\n\nA plea of guilty constituted a legal conviction within the meaning of this section, even though the plea had not been reduced to a written judgment and sentence at the time the subsequent offense was committed.State v. Castillo, 1987-NMCA-036, 105 N.M. 623, 735 P.2d 540, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 618, 735 P.2d 535.\n\nIf defendant pleads guilty in criminal proceeding in another state where no adjudication of guilt entered, and if the courts of that state did not consider such an action to be a \"conviction\", then that proceeding may not be considered a conviction for the purposes of the Habitual Offender Act.State v. Burk, 1984-NMCA-043, 101 N.M. 263, 680 P.2d 980.\n\n\"Conviction\" does not include imposition of sentence.— The \"conviction\" to which the habitual offender statute refers is simply a finding of guilt and does not include the imposition of a sentence.State v. Larranaga, 1967-NMSC-047, 77 N.M. 528, 424 P.2d 804.\n\nThe habitual offender statute did not make imposition of sentence upon the previous convictions a prerequisite to the enhancement of punishment upon the fourth conviction. The conviction is the finding of guilt. Sentence is not an element of the conviction but rather a declaration of its consequences.State v. Larranaga, 1967-NMSC-047, 77 N.M. 528, 424 P.2d 804.\n\nDeferred sentence for previous conviction of no consequence.— Habitual offender proceedings are based by statute on prior felony convictions. Since it is not necessary to impose sentence in order to constitute a violation, a deferred sentence for a previous conviction is of no consequence.Padilla v. State, 1977-NMSC-063, 90 N.M. 664, 568 P.2d 190.\n\nA criminal sentence that was originally deferredmay be enhanced in a later habitual offender proceeding.State v. Davis, 1986-NMSC-031, 104 N.M. 229, 719 P.2d 807.\n\nConviction, not sentence, is polestar.— For purposes of enhancement \"conviction\" is the polestar, not the sentence imposed.State v. Davis, 1986-NMSC-031, 104 N.M. 229, 719 P.2d 807.\n\nSection contemplates valid convictionswhich have not been vacated.State v. Moser, 1967-NMSC-163, 78 N.M. 212, 430 P.2d 106,overruled on other grounds byState v. Orona, 1982-NMSC-002, 97 N.M. 232, 638 P.2d 1077.\n\nProbation violation is not a crimeand does not trigger an enhancement as a habitual offender.State v. Ortega, 2004-NMCA-080, 135 N.M. 737, 93 P.3d 758, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-006, 135 N.M. 788, 93 P.3d 1292.\n\nQuestion of constitutionality of prior trial and conviction may be raised.— Question of the adequacy of representation so as to meet the requirements of due process in a prior trial and conviction in another state may be raised as an issue under the habitual criminal statute.State v. Dalrymple, 1965-NMSC-124, 75 N.M. 514, 407 P.2d 356.\n\nUncounseled convictions.— A prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction can be used to enhance a subsequent conviction if the prior conviction did not result in a sentence of imprisonment or, if it did result in a sentence of imprisonment, the right to counsel had been validly waived.State v. Hosteen, 1997-NMSC-063, 124 N.M. 402, 951 P.2d 619.\n\nDefendant's assertion that two prior felony convictions could not be used against him in prosecution under habitual criminal statute because they were constitutionally defective due to the absence of counsel at his preliminary examination in both convictions was without merit where the record showed that in each of the two prior felony convictions defendant entered pleas of guilty, that in each of the guilty pleas defendant had the advice of counsel, and no claim was made that the pleas were involuntary, defendant's claimed defect was waived when he pleaded guilty in the two prior felony proceedings.State v. Lopez, 1973-NMCA-014, 84 N.M. 600, 506 P.2d 344.\n\nPrior conviction, not prior sentence, is dispositive for repeat offender status.— Where defendant was convicted of drug charges in New Mexico; the New Mexico court deferred defendant's sentence for a two-year probationary period; the deferred sentence was a final judgment subject to appeal; and after defendant successfully completed the probation, defendant was entitled to have the New Mexico charges dismissed, the deferred sentence was a prior conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement.United States v. Meraz, 998 F.2d 182 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nCollateral attack on prior conviction.— A defendant may collaterally attack the validity of a prior conviction where the state seeks to utilize the prior conviction as a basis for sentence enhancement under this section.State v. Valdez, 1988-NMCA-074, 107 N.M. 642, 763 P.2d 76.\n\nDouble use of prior felony.— Where the defendants were convicted of the charge of felon in possession of a firearm contrary to Section 30-7-16 NMSA 1978, and the defendants were also sentenced as habitual offenders in accordance with this section, the trial court erred in sentencing the defendants as habitual offenders when the same prior felony convictions were relied upon to convict the defendants of the underlying offense of felon in possession of a firearm.State v. Haddenham, 1990-NMCA-048, 110 N.M. 149, 793 P.2d 279, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 183, 793 P.2d 865.\n\nIf a prior felony conviction is already taken into account in determining the punishment for the specific crime, the legislature did not intend that prior felony conviction also to be used in establishing that defendant was a habitual offender.State v. Peppers, 1990-NMCA-057, 110 N.M. 393, 796 P.2d 614, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 260, 794 P.2d 734.\n\nWhere defendant's prior convictions for cocaine trafficking and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute resulted from a single arrest, the court did not make an impermissible \"double use\" of the prior convictions by utilizing the prior cocaine trafficking conviction to enhance the defendant's present cocaine trafficking conviction to a first degree felony pursuant to Section 30-31-20B(2) NMSA 1978, and then using the other prior conviction for possession of marijuana to enhance defendant's sentence under the general habitual-offender statute, Section 31-18-17C NMSA 1978.State v. Hubbard, 1992-NMCA-014, 113 N.M. 538, 828 P.2d 971, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 352, 826 P.2d 573.\n\nWhere a trial court convicted defendant of one count of a second offense of trafficking a controlled substance and one count of conspiracy to commit that offense, and in sentencing defendant, the trial court used defendant's prior convictions twice to increase the punishment, the prior trafficking conviction could not be used to set defendant's underlying conspiracy to commit trafficking conviction as a second degree felony, and then be used to enhance defendant's sentence under the habitual offender statute.State v. Lacey, 2002-NMCA-032, 131 N.M. 684, 41 P.3d 952, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 737, 42 P.3d 842.\n\nProper reading of Subsection D(2).— Under the definition of \"prior felony conviction\", a prior felony conviction requires conformance with the provisions of Subsection A(2)(a) and (b) (now D(2)(a) and (b)) or conformance with Subsection A(2)(a) and (c) (now D(2)(a) and (c)) and should be read as though the word \"and\" was inserted between subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Subsection A(2) (now D(2)).State v. Harris, 1984-NMCA-003, 101 N.M. 12, 677 P.2d 625.\n\nHabitual criminal status not conviction, but enhanced sentence.— The habitual criminal status is not a conviction of a distinct crime. Indeed, a conviction on the merits has occurred and the crime convicted of is unrelated to the habitual criminal provisions, which produce not a judgment of guilt of the offense, but rather an enhanced sentence.Linam v. Griffin, 685 F.2d 369 (10th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1211, 103 S. Ct. 1207, 75 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1983).\n\nA habitual offender proceeding is a sentencing procedure and not a trial of an offense.Perez v. Sullivan, 793 F.2d 249 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 936, 107 S. Ct. 413, 93 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1986).\n\nHabitual offender sentence of five-time shoplifting felon proper.— A sentence of eight years' imprisonment, imposed under the habitual offender statute against a defendant convicted for the fifth time on felony shoplifting charges, was not so disproportionate as to require reversal as cruel and unusual punishment under the New Mexico Constitution, notwithstanding facts that three of the convictions were over 15 years old, and the latest charge was only $3 over the minimum threshold for felony shoplifting.State v. Rueda, 1999-NMCA-033, 126 N.M. 738, 975 P.2d 351, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 391, 981 P.2d 1209.\n\nFelony must be committed subsequent to prior conviction.— The felony for which a defendant is being punished must be one committed subsequent to the dates of the convictions relied on to effect an increase of the penalty.State v. Linam, 1979-NMSC-004, 93 N.M. 307, 600 P.2d 253, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 846, 100 S. Ct. 91, 62 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1979).\n\nThe repeal of former Section 31-18-5 NMSA 1978 and the enactment of this section do not affect the holding inState v. Linam, 1979-NMSC-004, 93 N.M. 307, 600 P.2d 253, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 846, 100 S. Ct. 91, 62 L. Ed. 2d 59, that, for purposes of an enhanced sentence, the felony for which a defendant is being sentenced must have been committed after conviction for a preceding felony.Hernandez v. State, 1981-NMSC-091, 96 N.M. 585, 633 P.2d 693.\n\nRemand following appeal allowed, to obtain evidence on date of prior crime.— The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment does not bar a remand following an appeal, directed at obtaining evidence as to the dates of the prior commission of crimes in order to satisfy the interpretation of the New Mexico habitual criminal statute that there be proof that each felony was committed after a conviction for the preceding felony.Linam v. Griffin, 685 F.2d 369 (10th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1211, 103 S. Ct. 1207, 75 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1983).\n\nSentence for each of multiple current convictions to be enhanced.— The reference to \"a\" felony in this section does not change the requirement that the sentence for each of multiple current felony convictions be enhanced.State v. Harris, 1984-NMCA-003, 101 N.M. 12, 677 P.2d 625.\n\nBasic sentence.— In choosing the term \"basic sentence\" the legislature referred to the sentence to be enhanced. If a person with a prior felony conviction is convicted of multiple felonies, then there are several basic sentences. Thus, there may be multiple enhancements.State v. Howard, 1989-NMCA-029, 108 N.M. 560, 775 P.2d 762, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 433, 773 P.2d 1240.\n\nSupplemental recidivist information not duplicitous.— A supplemental information which gave defendant notice that his three prior felony convictions would provide the basis for enhancing his sentence was not a joinder of offenses and, therefore, not void for duplicity.State v. Harris, 1984-NMCA-003, 101 N.M. 12, 677 P.2d 625.\n\nSentences served concurrently unless trial court or legislature requires consecutive sentences.— The trial court has discretion to require sentences to be served consecutively, but if this is not done, and there is no legislation covering the situation, the sentences are to be served concurrently.State v. Mayberry, 1982-NMCA-061, 97 N.M. 760, 643 P.2d 629.\n\nThe district court has discretion to order that enhanced sentences for multiple offenses be served concurrently.State v. Triggs, 2012-NMCA-068, 281 P.3d 1256.\n\nEnhanced sentences for multiple offenses may be served concurrently.— Pursuant to defendant's plea agreement, defendant was convicted of nine property offenses and received basic sentences that ran consecutively, two of the sentences were enhanced based on two prior felony convictions; defendant agreed that the remaining sentences would be subject to habitual offender enhancement upon a violation of law or a violation of a condition of parole or probation; defendant violated the conditions of parole for one of the offenses that had been fully enhanced under the plea agreement; the district court found that defendant was an habitual offender and enhanced each of the seven sentences that had not been enhanced under the plea agreement; and there was nothing in the plea agreement that required the district court to run the enhancements consecutively, the district court had the discretion to order that the enhanced sentences be served concurrently.State v. Triggs, 2012-NMCA-068, 281 P.3d 1256.\n\nSentences under multiple enhancement provisions.— It is not improper to enhance a sentence under the general habitual offender statute if it has already been enhanced under the firearm enhancement statute.State v. Reaves, 1982-NMCA-169, 99 N.M. 73, 653 P.2d 904.\n\nThe state was not prevented from using distinct felonies obtained in the same judgment and sentence for the separate purposes of enhancement under the felon in possession statute and the general habitual offender statute.State v. Calvillo, 1991-NMCA-038, 112 N.M. 140, 812 P.2d 794, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 77, 811 P.2d 575.\n\nPrior fourth-degree-felony DWI conviction, pursuant to Subsection G of Section 66-8-102 NMSA 1978, could not be used to enhance the sentences, pursuant to this section, of defendants convicted of a non-DWI felony.State v. Begay, 2001-NMSC-002, 130 N.M. 61, 17 P.3d 434.\n\nDefendants convicted of the offense of felony DWI under Subsection G of Section 66-8-102 NMSA 1978 are not subject to sentence enhancement under both the felony DWI provision and this section.State v. Anaya, 1997-NMSC-010, 123 N.M. 14, 933 P.2d 223;State v. Gonzales, 1997-NMSC-050, 124 N.M. 171, 947 P.2d 128.\n\nA prior armed robbery conviction may not be considered for enhancement under both the armed robbery statute and the habitual offender provision; accordingly, in the case of a defendant who has one prior burglary, one prior armed robbery, and one current armed robbery, the sentence for the current offense, discounting any reduction for mitigating circumstances, should be that for a second armed robbery, under Section 30-16-2 NMSA 1978, plus a one-year enhancement for the prior burglary under the habitual offender provisions.State v. Keith, 1985-NMCA-012, 102 N.M. 462, 697 P.2d 145, cert. denied, 102 N.M. 492, 697 P.2d 492.\n\nSentences cannot be served concurrently.— An additional one-year sentence for the use of a firearm and an additional one-year sentence as an habitual offender cannot be served concurrently.State v. Mayberry, 1982-NMCA-061, 97 N.M. 760, 643 P.2d 629.\n\nProper to enhance failure-to-appear charge.— Defendant's conviction for vehicular homicide could be used to enhance his failure-to-appear sentence, because the two acts - failure to appear at sentencing and vehicular homicide - were far from contemporaneous, and the state did not have to prove vehicular homicide as an element of the failure-to-appear offense.State v. Peppers, 1990-NMCA-057, 110 N.M. 393, 796 P.2d 614, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 260, 794 P.2d 734.\n\nMultiple convictions at one trial.— Where a conviction on two or more counts arising out of acts committed in the course of a single transaction has been entered, the convictions should count as one for the purpose of sentencing under an habitual offender statute. On the other hand, where multiple convictions are obtained for crimes unrelated to one another, no prohibition has been found to prevent counting each conviction separately in habitual offender proceedings.State v. Sanchez, 1975-NMCA-014, 87 N.M. 256, 531 P.2d 1229.\n\nIf, under this section, multiple prior convictions arose out of a unified course of events, the multiple convictions count as one conviction in the habitual offender proceedings; but, if the defendant had a prior felony conviction, the trial court could properly enhance each of three subsequent felony convictions as a second felony conviction.State v. Baker, 1977-NMCA-033, 90 N.M. 291, 562 P.2d 1145.\n\nNature of punishment of prior conviction.— Where 17-year-old defendant was convicted in South Carolina of burglary and larceny, because the court found him amenable to treatment and placed him on probation as a \"youthful offender\" whose sentence was rehabilitative in nature his prior conviction did not satisfy the provisions of this section.State v. Smith, 2000-NMCA-101, 129 N.M. 738, 13 P.3d 470.\n\nConviction in another state.— Defendant's conviction by a Texas court constituted a \"prior felony conviction\" for purposes of the New Mexico habitual-offender statute, even though defendant had been placed on probation after his conviction, the indictment was set aside by a Texas court after completion of probation, and the conviction could not be considered under the Texas habitual-offender statute.State v. Edmondson, 1991-NMCA-069, 112 N.M. 654, 818 P.2d 855, cert. quashed, 112 N.M. 641, 818 P.2d 419.\n\nWhere, contrary to defendant's assertion, the evidence does not indicate that Section 18-4-502, Colorado Statutes, was not a felony in Colorado either at the time defendant committed the offense or at the time of his conviction, Colorado conviction was a felony covered by this section.State v. Sandoval, 2004-NMCA-046, 135 N.M. 420, 89 P.3d 92, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-006, 135 N.M. 789, 93 P.3d 1292.\n\nUse of prior conviction that is not felony offense in New Mexico.— Whether or not the Colorado felony is a felony in New Mexico, the felony conviction may be used if it was punishable by imprisonment of more than one year.State v. Wilson, 1993-NMCA-074, 117 N.M. 11, 868 P.2d 656, cert. quashed, 119 N.M. 311, 889 P.2d 1233 (1995).\n\nPrior convictions which are not felonies under laws of New Mexico will not support increased penaltyfor a felony conviction in New Mexico.State v. Knight, 1965-NMSC-058, 75 N.M. 197, 402 P.2d 380;State v. Silas, 1979-NMSC-008, 92 N.M. 434, 589 P.2d 674;State v. Montoya, 1979-NMCA-044, 92 N.M. 734, 594 P.2d 1190,aff'd, 1980-NMSC-093, 94 N.M. 704, 616 P.2d 417.\n\nPrior federal felony convictions.— Where prior federal convictions for transporting stolen automobiles across state lines were not felonies in New Mexico, an increased penalty for a forgery felony conviction in New Mexico as a habitual criminal is improper.State v. Knight, 1965-NMSC-058, 75 N.M. 197, 402 P.2d 380.\n\nPresumption as to law of sister state.— When previous conviction is charged to be an offense which is designated by name by the law of New Mexico as one falling within the required category, it is presumed that the conviction in the other state carried with it all the essentials of the crime in New Mexico, as the law of a sister state is presumed to be the same as that of the forum, absent proof to the contrary.State v. Lott, 1963-NMSC-219, 73 N.M. 280, 387 P.2d 855.\n\nPrior felony need not be such on date of prosecution as habitual criminal.— The habitual offender statute contains no provision requiring the prior felony to be such an offense on the date of subsequent prosecution as an habitual criminal. The date of the conviction in the foreign state is the time to be considered in determining whether the offense charged as the prior conviction would have been a felony in this state.State v. Lott, 1963-NMSC-219, 73 N.M. 280, 387 P.2d 855.\n\nAmendment or repeal of statute subsequent to conviction under it.— If defendant's violation of a statute was a felony at the time, changes in or repeal of the statute subsequent to that time do not preclude the use of that conviction in prosecutions under the habitual offender statute.State v. Darrah, 1966-NMSC-171, 76 N.M. 671, 417 P.2d 805.\n\nEffect of executive pardon.— An executive pardon of the offense which provokes the court into imposing a life sentence under the habitual offender statute is unavailing to deny the court authority to employ the same felony convictions again for purpose of imposing a sentence under the habitual offender statute, if subsequent to his pardon the prisoner commits another felony.Shankle v. Woodruff, 1958-NMSC-054, 64 N.M. 88, 324 P.2d 1017.\n\nEffect of pardoned offenses.— The governor has the power to pardon habitual offender sentences, but the pardoned offense may nevertheless be used to enhance future sentences for future crimes.State v. Mondragon, 1988-NMCA-027, 107 N.M. 421, 759 P.2d 1003, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 267,. 755 P.2d 605.\n\n\"Purchase\" of heroin is felony for purposes of section.— Where a federal conviction is had in New Mexico upon a purchase of heroin in New Mexico, the \"purchase\" of heroin necessarily includes the actual or constructive \"possession\" of heroin, and actual or constructive possession of heroin is a felony under the laws of New Mexico for purposes of this section.State v. Montoya, 1980-NMSC-093, 94 N.M. 704, 616 P.2d 417.\n\nEffect of additional convictions on habitual offender statute.— Prosecution under the habitual offender statute is not barred upon any conviction in addition to fourth felony conviction, and such additional conviction may be prosecuted for the purpose of enhancing sentence at any time, otherwise lawful, as if it were the fourth felony conviction.State v. Sanchez, 1975-NMCA-014, 87 N.M. 256, 531 P.2d 1229.\n\nAlternative methods of showing prior convictions.— If a state adopts the policy of imposing heavier punishment for repeated offending, there is manifest propriety in guarding against the escape from this penalty of those whose previous conviction was not suitably made known to the court at the time of their trial. It is to prevent such a frustration of its policy that provision is made for alternative methods, either by alleging the fact of prior conviction in the indictment and showing it upon the trial, or by a subsequent proceeding in which the identity of the prisoner may be ascertained and he may be sentenced to the full punishment fixed by law.State v. Gonzales, 1972-NMCA-130, 84 N.M. 275, 502 P.2d 300, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 271, 502 P.2d 296.\n\nEnhanced sentence may be imposed though maximum for felony served.— Under this section, imposition of enhanced sentence was proper even though maximum sentence for felony conviction which had given rise to it had been completely served.Lott v. Cox, 1966-NMSC-038, 76 N.M. 76, 412 P.2d 249.\n\nNolo contendere plea as basis for conviction.— A plea of nolo contendere, accepted and recorded in open court, may provide a proper sentence for conviction which may be used to enhance a sentence under this habitual criminal statute.State v. Marquez, 1986-NMCA-119, 105 N.M. 269, 731 P.2d 965, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 211, 730 P.2d 1193.\n\nChronologically, factually separate felonies properly used for enhancement.— Since the facts and elements of defendant's 1986 predicate felony of receiving stolen property and his 1988 felony conviction for felon in possession of a firearm were both separate in time and involved different facts from those underlying his felony convictions in the case under adjudication, they were properly used as separate felonies for purposes of enhancing defendant's later felony convictions under this section.State v. Yparrea, 1992-NMCA-128, 114 N.M. 805, 845 P.2d 1259, cert. denied, 114 N.M. 720, 845 P.2d 814 (1993).\n\nFederal conviction as prior conviction.— For a federal conviction to be considered as a prior conviction under the habitual offender statute, the conviction must be for a crime which if committed within this state would be a felony.State v. Garcia, 1978-NMCA-109, 92 N.M. 730, 594 P.2d 1186, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 532, 591 P.2d 286;State v. Montoya, 1979-NMCA-044, 92 N.M. 734, 594 P.2d 1190,aff'd, 1980-NMSC-093, 94 N.M. 704, 616 P.2d 417.\n\nIII. PROCEDURAL MATTERS.\n\nThe state is not required to make a prima facie showing of defendant's past convictions before the sentencing hearing.State v. Godoy, 2012-NMCA-084, 284 P.3d 410, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-007.\n\nWhere, eight days after defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine, the state filed a supplemental information alleging that defendant was a habitual offender subject to sentence enhancement; four days later, the state served notice of intent to seek an enhanced sentence and demanded that defendant give notice of defendant's intention to challenge the validity of any prior convictions; defendant did not file a notice that defendant would challenge the validity of prior convictions; at the arraignment on the supplemental information, defense counsel denied the allegations of the previous convictions and told the court that there would be issues with some of the alleged convictions; at the sentencing hearing, the state presented authenticated copies of the previous convictions; defendant did not contest the convictions; and defendant claimed that the trial court filed to provide defendant with adequate process because the state failed to make a prima facie showing of defendant's prior convictions before the sentencing hearing and that defendant did not have a fair opportunity at the sentencing hearing to review and rebut the evidence of the prior convictions, the enhancement of defendant's sentence complied with statutory requirements and was proper because the state provided adequate notice to defendant of its intent and then proved the existence of the prior convictions by a preponderance of the evidence at the sentencing hearing.State v. Godoy, 2012-NMCA-084, 284 P.3d 410, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-007.\n\nViolation of plea and disposition agreement.— Where the defendant entered into a plea and disposition agreement in which the state agreed not to bring habitual offender proceedings \"if and only if\" the defendant completed at least one year of inpatient alcohol treatment and successfully completed probation without a violation; the defendant violated probation one month after beginning to serve probation and knowingly and voluntarily admitted to the probation violation; the state did not bring habitual offender proceedings based on the probation violation and the district court placed the defendant on a second probation; the defendant violated probation a second time; and the state initiated habitual offender proceedings before the district court held a hearing on the second violation of probation, the district court was authorized to enhance the defendant's sentence.State v. Leyba, 2009-NMCA-030, 145 N.M. 712, 204 P.3d 37, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-002, 145 N.M. 704, 204 P.3d 29.\n\nNew rule setting order of proof to operate prospectively only.— The new rule of law inState v. Linam, 1979-NMSC-004, 93 N.M. 307, 600 P.2d 253, decided on January 11, 1979, setting forth the order of proof required in habitual offender sentencing, was intended to operate prospectively only.State v. Valenzuela, 1980-NMSC-047, 94 N.M. 340, 610 P.2d 744,overruled in part byHernandez v. State, 1981-NMSC-091, 96 N.M. 585, 633 P.2d 693.\n\nBurden of proof.— Federal law requires that the state prove a prior conviction by a preponderance of evidence.State v. Smith, 2000-NMSC-005, 128 N.M. 588, 995 P.2d 1030.\n\nState required to prove specific sequence of commissions and convictions.— In order to justify imposition of the enhanced sentence the state is required to prove a specific sequence of \"commissions\" and \"convictions.\"State v. Valenzuela, 1979-NMCA-072, 94 N.M. 285, 609 P.2d 1241,aff'd, 1980-NMSC-047, 94 N.M. 340, 610 P.2d 744,overruled in part byHernandez v. State, 1981-NMSC-091, 96 N.M. 585, 633 P.2d 693.\n\nUnless waived by the terms of the plea agreement.— Defendant waived his right to contest the evidence of the prior convictions by agreeing to the terms of the plea agreement.State v. Sanchez, 2001-NMCA-060, 130 N.M. 602, 28 P.3d 1143, cert denied, 130 N.M. 713, 30 P.3d 1147.\n\nDate of commission of offense essential element in prosecution.— To establish the date of the commission of the offense giving rise to the habitual offender proceeding is an essential element in such a prosecution.State v. Valenzuela, 1979-NMCA-072, 94 N.M. 285, 609 P.2d 1241,aff'd, 1980-NMSC-047, 94 N.M. 340, 610 P.2d 744,overruled in part byHernandez v. State, 1981-NMSC-091, 96 N.M. 585, 633 P.2d 693.\n\nWhere there is no proof as to the date of commission of the second felony by defendant, an enhanced habitual offender sentence cannot stand.State v. Valenzuela, 1980-NMSC-047, 94 N.M. 340, 610 P.2d 744,overruled in part byHernandez v. State, 1981-NMSC-091, 96 N.M. 585, 633 P.2d 693.\n\nDefendant's introduction to jury does not interfere with its duty of determining identity.— The introduction of the defendant to the jury by his name in no way interferes with the jury's duty of determining whether the named and identified defendant is the same person who was convicted of the crimes for which he is being charged in the supplemental information.State v. Olivares, 1980-NMCA-165, 95 N.M. 222, 620 P.2d 380.\n\nAn unrelated plea agreementcontaining an admission of the defendant's identity in prior convictions was admissible for purposes of a habitual offender proceeding.State v. Roybal, 1995-NMCA-097, 120 N.M. 507, 903 P.2d 249, cert. denied, 120 N.M. 498, 903 P.2d 240.\n\nState must present some evidence to carry burden of validly obtained pleas.— Although it is settled law that the absence of the record of the guilty plea proceedings does not establish the invalidity of the pleas, the state must present some evidence in order to carry its burden of persuasion that the pleas were validly obtained.State v. Garcia, 1980-NMSC-132, 95 N.M. 246, 620 P.2d 1271.\n\nWhere state's exhibits establish prima facie case establishing valid guilty plea,the defendant must then produce evidence that supports the asserted invalidity of these pleas.State v. Garcia, 1980-NMSC-132, 95 N.M. 246, 620 P.2d 1271.\n\nWhere defendant claims a prior guilty plea was invalid,the state makes a prima facie case establishing a valid guilty plea upon proof that the defendant has been convicted of a crime.State v. Garcia, 1980-NMSC-132, 95 N.M. 246, 620 P.2d 1271.\n\nWhen validity of prior convictions becomes proper issue.— Until the defendant raises an issue as to the validity of prior convictions, \"validity\" is not an issue in the case.State v. O'Neil, 1978-NMCA-056, 91 N.M. 727, 580 P.2d 495, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 491, 576 P.2d 297.\n\nConditional discharge used to enhance sentence.— Even though a prior conditional discharge could not be used for enhancement purposes at the time the defendant was originally sentenced, since he had agreed to such use and that he would not challenge it on appeal, the trial court did not err in using the conditional discharge to enhance the defendant's sentence.State v. Handa, 1995-NMCA-042, 120 N.M. 38, 897 P.2d 225, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 771, 895 P.2d 671.\n\nUse of the defendant's prior conditional discharge to prove that he was a felon in order to convict him of the crime of felon in possession of a firearm and to enhance his sentence for underlying assault convictions did not violate his double jeopardy rights.State v. Handa, 1995-NMCA-042, 120 N.M. 38, 897 P.2d 225, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 771, 895 P.2d 671.\n\nGuilty pleas, disputed by vague evidence, accepted.— Once the state's exhibits establish a prima facie case that a defendant has previously pled guilty to felonies, the defendant is entitled to bring forth contrary evidence, but it is his burden to do so. Based on the defendant's vague and somewhat inconsistent recollections about whether he had the advice of counsel before he pled guilty to previous crimes, the judge did not abuse her discretion in accepting those convictions as the basis for the habitual offender enhancements.State v. Duncan, 1994-NMCA-030, 117 N.M. 407, 872 P.2d 380, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 524, 873 P.2d 270.\n\nAsserted invalidity of prior convictions is a defenseto the habitual offender charge.State v. O'Neil, 1978-NMCA-056, 91 N.M. 727, 580 P.2d 495, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 491, 576 P.2d 297.\n\nBurdens of production of evidence and of persuasion distinguished.— Where defendant's claim of invalidity is raised as a defense to a habitual offender charge, defendant must provide evidence in support of his defense. Once he does so, he is not required to persuade the fact finder concerning his defense; rather, the state has the burden of persuasion because it is the state, not defendant, who must prove a case.State v. O'Neil, 1978-NMCA-056, 91 N.M. 727, 580 P.2d 495, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 491, 576 P.2d 297.\n\nValidity of prior guilty pleas is issue to be decided by courtin a habitual offender proceeding.State v. O'Neil, 1978-NMCA-056, 91 N.M. 727, 580 P.2d 495, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 491, 576 P.2d 297.\n\nWhere record in habitual offender proceeding is silent as to invalidity,there is no basis for holding the prior convictions invalid.State v. O'Neil, 1978-NMCA-056, 91 N.M. 727, 580 P.2d 495, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 491, 576 P.2d 297.\n\nBurden not on state when \"record is silent\".— A trial court errs in placing an affirmative burden on the state when the \"record is silent\" concerning the validity of prior guilty pleas.State v. O'Neil, 1978-NMCA-056, 91 N.M. 727, 580 P.2d 495, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 491, 576 P.2d 297.\n\nDouble jeopardy defense waived by plea agreement.— The defendant waived his double jeopardy defense by entering a plea agreement which provided that the state could pursue additional habitual offender proceedings to enhance the defendant's sentence in the event his probation was revoked or he otherwise failed to fulfill his obligations under the agreement, and Section 30-1-10 NMSA 1978, precluding waiver of a double jeopardy defense, did not apply to prevent waiver in such case.Montoya v. New Mexico, 55 F.3d 1496 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\nThe district court properly retained jurisdiction to apply habitual offender enhancement following defendant's violation of probation.— Where defendant pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and conspiracy to commit tampering with evidence, and where, under the plea agreement, defendant admitted her identity in two prior felonies and the state agreed to seek habitual offender enhancement for only one prior felony and to hold the other in abeyance, and where defendant was sentenced to thirty-six months in prison with a one-year habitual offender enhancement for each charge, for a total of five years of incarceration, and where the district court suspended three years of defendant's incarceration and instead imposed three years of probation to begin after her release from her two-year prison sentence relating to her habitual offender enhancements, and where defendant, after her release from prison and during her probationary period, violated probation multiple times, prompting the state to file a petition to revoke defendant's probation on three occasions, and where the district court revoked defendant's probation following the state's third petition and enhanced defendant's sentences by three years each based on the prior felony that was held in abeyance in the plea agreement, the district court did not err in enhancing defendant's sentence, because the district court resolved any ambiguities present in the plea agreement by informing defendant of the potential consequences if she violated probation. Defendant, therefore, should have reasonably expected that she faced an additional eight years of incarceration if she violated probation and that each count was subject to a habitual offender enhancement throughout her entire probationary period.State v. Banghart-Portillo, 2022-NMSC-021,aff'gA-1-CA-36917, mem. op. (N.M. Ct. App. Oct. 24, 2018) (nonprecedential).\n\nSentence enhancement based on violation of plea agreement.— Since the defendant violated the terms of a plea agreement providing that the state could pursue additional habitual offender proceedings to enhance the defendant's sentence in the event his probation was revoked or he otherwise failed to fulfill his obligations under the agreement, the imposition of additional sentence enhancements did not constitute an impermissible multiple punishment.Montoya v. New Mexico, 55 F.3d 1496 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\nSince the plea agreement provided that the state would pursue additional enhancement if the defendant violated conditions of his probation, when the defendant violated the probation, additional enhancement was authorized based, not on the probation violation, but on the prior felonies.State v. Freed, 1996-NMCA-044, 121 N.M. 562, 915 P.2d 325, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 644, 916 P.2d 844.\n\nStatutory scheme does not delegate legislative responsibility to prosecution.— In no sense does the habitual offender statutory scheme delegate to the prosecution the legislative responsibility to fix criminal penalties.Martinez v. Romero, 626 F.2d 807 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1019, 101 S. Ct. 585, 66 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1980).\n\nSubsection B only prohibits suspending or deferring one-year sentence imposed by subsection,and does not affect the trial court's discretion to suspend or defer the basic sentence imposed.State v. Russell, 1980-NMCA-074, 94 N.M. 544, 612 P.2d 1355.\n\nCredit for time served.— When the defendant who had served one year of an enhanced sentence was subject to a second four-year enhancement, the court was required to give credit for the time served, and giving credit did not convert the second enhancement into an unauthorized three-year sentence.State v. Freed, 1996-NMCA-044, 121 N.M. 562, 915 P.2d 325, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 644, 916 P.2d 844.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"State v.

Sedillo, 1971-NMCA-003, 82 N.M. 287, 480 P.2d 401.\n\nHabitual offender statute is mandatory.— The district attorney had a duty to prosecute defendant as an habitual offender if his conviction brought him within the statute.State v. Cruz, 1971-NMCA-047, 82 N.M. 522, 484 P.2d 364.\n\nThe provisions of this act have been construed as mandatory.State v. Baldonado, 1968-NMCA-025, 79 N.M. 175, 441 P.2d 215.\n\nThe provisions of the habitual criminal statute are mandatory.State v. Santillanes, 1982-NMCA-118, 98 N.M. 448, 649 P.2d 516.\n\nThe provisions of the Habitual Offender Act are mandatory, and the district attorney has an affirmative duty to prosecute habitual offenders.State v. Davis, 1986-NMSC-031, 104 N.M. 229, 719 P.2d 807.\n\nDiscretion to seek or not seek enhanced sentencing.— Despite the mandatory tone of this section, the prosecutor has discretion to seek or not to seek enhanced sentencing.March v. State, 1989-NMSC-065, 109 N.M. 110, 782 P.2d 82.\n\nNo vindictiveness in actions of district attorney's office in seeking habitual offender enhancements.— The prosecution has a statutory duty, at any time, either after sentence or conviction, if it appears that a person convicted of a noncapital felony is or may be a habitual offender, to file an information charging that person as a habitual offender.State v. Duncan, 1994-NMCA-030, 117 N.M. 407, 872 P.2d 380, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 524, 873 P.2d 270.\n\nEnhanced sentence proper even though probation completed, where maximum statutory sentencing period unexpired.— Under this section, the imposition of an enhanced sentence is proper even though a defendant has completed a period of probation, where the maximum period for which he could have been sentenced for the offense has not yet expired.State v. Santillanes, 1982-NMCA-118, 98 N.M. 448, 649 P.2d 516.\n\nStatutory scheme does not delegate legislative responsibility to prosecution.— In no sense does the habitual offender statutory scheme delegate to the prosecution the legislative responsibility to fix criminal penalties.Martinez v. Romero, 626 F.2d 807 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1019, 101 S. Ct. 585, 66 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1980).\n\nSpecific statute controls over 39-1-1 NMSA 1978.— As the provisions of the habitual offender statute are mandatory, the specific provision of filing charges \"at any time\" in the statute controls over the general provision of Section 39-1-1 NMSA 1978, which gives a trial court jurisdiction over its final judgment in a nonjury trial for 30 days after entry of final judgment.State v. Padilla, 1978-NMCA-060, 92 N.M. 19, 582 P.2d 396, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 180, 585 P.2d 324.\n\nState's filing information violated expectation of finality in sentencing.— State's filing information as to enhanced sentencing after defendant's earning of meritorious deductions brought his service of sentence to an end violated his objectively reasonable expectation of finality in sentencing for double jeopardy purposes.March v. State, 1989-NMSC-065, 109 N.M. 110, 782 P.2d 82.\n\nDefendant's expectation of \"final\" sentencing.— Defendant, a three-time felony offender, had no reasonable expectation of finality in a three-year probationary sentence for a larceny conviction; therefore, it was not a violation of his double jeopardy rights for the state to seek a subsequent conviction of defendant, during the probationary period, under the habitual offender laws.State v. Villalobos, 1998-NMSC-036, 126 N.M. 255, 968 P.2d 766.\n\nDistrict attorney's or judge's knowledge of prior convictions.— Knowledge by the district attorney of prior convictions, and even knowledge by the judge, does not bar a prosecution under the habitual offender statute, the setting aside of a former sentence and the imposition of a new one.State v. McCraw, 1955-NMSC-050, 59 N.M. 348, 284 P.2d 670.\n\nProsecution's knowledge of prior felony conviction.— Where, before the defendant is convicted for a felony, the prosecutor knows of a prior felony conviction, this knowledge does not require the dismissal of a latter habitual offender charge because of a filing delay.State v. Mayberry, 1982-NMCA-061, 97 N.M. 760, 643 P.2d 629.\n\nInformation does not purport to charge criminal offense.— An information under the habitual offender statutes does not purport to charge a criminal offense, but constitutes only a charge of prior convictions by defendant, which, if true, operates to enhance the penalty to be imposed.State v. Silva, 1967-NMCA-008, 78 N.M. 286, 430 P.2d 783.\n\nCharging by supplemental information.— The state did not violate its own procedures, and thus did not violate due process, by charging appellant as an habitual offender by supplemental information, since the supplemental information did not charge an offense, but rather a status, that of habitual offender.Minner v. Kerby, 30 F.3d 1311 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\nCharging by information sufficient.— Defendant had no right, either under New Mexico law or under the United States Constitution, to a grand jury indictment as to his habitual offender status.Minner v. Kerby, 30 F.3d 1311 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\nPleading prior convictions in information.— The controlling statute made no requirement that prior convictions be pleaded in the information itself.Shankle v. Woodruff, 1958-NMSC-054, 64 N.M. 88, 324 P.2d 1017.\n\nCourts in which defendant was previously convicted need not be named.— The habitual offender statutes do not require that the court or courts in which a defendant has been previously convicted be named.State v. Silva, 1967-NMCA-008, 78 N.M. 286, 430 P.2d 783.\n\nInformation not insufficient because of improper grammatical construction.— Assuming the meaning to be plain, information or indictment is not rendered insufficient because of improper grammatical construction.State v. Silva, 1967-NMCA-008, 78 N.M. 286, 430 P.2d 783.\n\nObjection to information not grounds for release on habeas corpus.— Objection to the information charging prior conviction sufficient to invoke the Habitual Criminal Act might have been made the basis of a timely appeal, but was not grounds for release on habeas corpus.Shankle v. Woodruff, 1958-NMSC-054, 64 N.M. 88, 324 P.2d 1017.\n\nThe provisions of the habitual criminal statute are mandatory.1987 Op. Att'y Gen.

      "text": "A. The court wherein a person has been convicted of a noncapital felony and where that person has been charged as a habitual offender under the provisions of Section 31-18-19 NMSA 1978 shall bring the defendant before it, whether he is confined in prison or not. The court shall inform him of:\n\n(1) the allegations of the information; and\n\n(2) his right to be tried as to the truth thereof according to law.\n\nB. The court shall require the defendant to say whether or not he is the same person as charged in the information. If the defendant denies being the same person or refuses to answer or remains silent, his plea or the fact of his silence shall be entered in the record and the court shall then conduct a hearing to determine if the offender is the same person.\n\nC. If the court finds that the defendant is the same person and that he was in fact convicted of the previous crime or crimes as charged, the court shall sentence him to the punishment as prescribed in Section 31-18-17 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-29-33, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 216, § 9; 1983, ch. 127, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For general consideration of the habitual offender statute,seenotes to 31-18-17 NMSA 1978.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nPurpose of former law.— Former section was enacted to give a person convicted of a felony in this state charged with being an habitual criminal the right to a separate trial before a jury and to require the state to prove in such separate proceedings the identity of the accused as the person alleged to have been convicted of the former crimes.Lott v. Cox, 1965-NMSC-037, 75 N.M. 102, 401 P.2d 93.\n\nHabitual offender statute creates no new offense,but merely provides a proceeding whereby one previously convicted of a felony or felonies may be given an enhanced sentence upon subsequent conviction in this state for another felony.State v. Bonner, 1970-NMCA-047, 81 N.M. 471, 468 P.2d 636.\n\nHabitual offender statute provides for an enhanced sentence.— The habitual criminal status is not a conviction of a distinct crime. Indeed, a conviction on the merits has occurred and the crime convicted of is unrelated to the habitual criminal provisions, which produce not a judgment of guilt of the offense, but rather an enhanced sentence.Linam v. Griffin, 685 F.2d 369 (10th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1211, 103 S. Ct. 1207, 75 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1983).\n\nHabitual criminal proceeding not constitutional adjudication.— The habitual criminal proceeding in New Mexico is not the kind of adjudication that is referred to in the fifth amendment double jeopardy clause.Linam v. Griffin, 685 F.2d 369 (10th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1211, 103 S. Ct. 1207, 75 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1983).\n\nNew Mexico habitual criminal proceeding is a trial on the issue of punishmentand double jeopardy bars a second try if the prosecution fails.Linam v. Griffin, 685 F.2d 369 (10th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1211, 103 S. Ct. 1207, 75 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1983) (concurring opinion).\n\nProceeding not trial for purposes of determining competency.— The habitual offender proceeding is not a trial in the constitutional sense for purposes of making a determination as to competency and Rule 35(b) N.M.R. Crim. P. (now Rule 5-602B NMRA) does not apply to such proceedings.State v. Nelson, 1981-NMSC-100, 96 N.M. 654, 634 P.2d 676.\n\nWhere record in habitual offender proceeding is silent as to invalidity,there is no basis for holding the prior convictions invalid.State v. O'Neil, 1978-NMCA-056, 91 N.M. 727, 580 P.2d 495, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 491, 576 P.2d 297.\n\nNo jeopardy attaches in habitual proceeding.— A habitual proceeding involves only sentencing, not trial of an offense, therefore jeopardy does not attach.State v. Rogers, 1979-NMSC-085, 93 N.M. 519, 602 P.2d 616.\n\nII. PROCEDURAL MATTERS.\n\nBurden of persuasion.— The validity of prior convictions is presumed until a defendant produces evidence reasonably tending to establish their invalidity. If the constitutional invalidity of prior convictions is not adequately shown, the burden of persuasion does not shift, and the State has no obligation to come forward with evidence.State v. Duarte, 1996-NMCA-038, 121 N.M. 553, 915 P.2d 309, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 444, 913 P.2d 251.\n\nStrict compliance required.— Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in this section is required.State v. Sanchez, 1972-NMCA-113, 84 N.M. 163, 500 P.2d 448.\n\nBurden of proof.— Federal law requires that the state prove a prior conviction by a preponderance of evidence.State v. Smith, 2000-NMSC-005, 128 N.M. 588, 995 P.2d 1030.\n\nRemand following appeal allowed, to obtain evidence on date of prior crime.— The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment does not bar a remand following an appeal, directed at obtaining evidence as to the dates of the prior commission of crimes in order to satisfy the interpretation of the New Mexico habitual criminal statute that there be proof that each felony was committed after a conviction for the preceding felony.Linam v. Griffin, 685 F.2d 369 (10th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1211, 103 S. Ct. 1207, 75 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1983).\n\nJudge to determine whether offense follows prior felony conviction.— Whether the commission of an offense was after a conviction for an earlier felony, thus qualifying for an enhanced penalty, may be determined by the trial judge.Hernandez v. State, 1981-NMSC-091, 96 N.M. 585, 633 P.2d 693.\n\nJury issues limited to identity and prior conviction.— The only questions that must be submitted to a jury upon a defendant's demand under the habitual offender statutes are those of identity and whether the defendant was previously convicted of the specific crime charged in the enhancement proceedings.Hernandez v. State, 1981-NMSC-091, 96 N.M. 585, 633 P.2d 693.\n\nUnless defendant raises validity of prior conviction as a defense,there are two issues to be determined in an habitual offender proceeding: (1) whether there was a prior felony conviction, and (2) whether the defendant is the same person who was convicted of the prior felony.State v. Hernandez, 1981-NMCA-036, 96 N.M. 604, 633 P.2d 712,rev'd on other grounds, 1981-NMSC-091, 96 N.M. 585, 633 P.2d 693.\n\nThere is no need of presentment by grand jurywhere the question was simply whether the party had been convicted of an offense, as an indictment is confined to the question whether an offense has been committed.State v. Gonzales, 1972-NMCA-130, 84 N.M. 275, 502 P.2d 300, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 271, 502 P.2d 296.\n\nAllegation of former conviction in indictment not required by constitution.— Although the state may properly provide for the allegation of the former conviction in the indictment, for a finding by the jury on this point in connection with its verdict as to guilt and thereupon for the imposition of the full sentence prescribed, there is no constitutional mandate which requires the state to adopt this course even where the former conviction is known.State v. Gonzales, 1972-NMCA-130, 84 N.M. 275, 502 P.2d 300, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 271, 502 P.2d 296.\n\nProof of defendant's identity.— Where a supplemental information was filed for the purpose of sentencing defendant as an habitual offender, the state was not required to affirmatively prove not only that defendant was the person previously convicted of the crimes listed in the information but also that he was the same person convicted in the underlying case in which the sentencing proceedings were taking place.State v. Salas, 1999-NMCA-099, 127 N.M. 686, 986 P.2d 482, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 149, 990 P.2d 823.\n\nSeparate proceeding permissible where only issue is identity.— The information charging defendant as an habitual offender was filed as a separate cause, and such a separate proceeding is permissible where the only issue is the identity of the accused as the person previously convicted of crimes within the meaning of the habitual offender statute.State v. Tipton, 1966-NMSC-202, 77 N.M. 1, 419 P.2d 216.\n\nInformation dismissed where proceedings not commenced within six months of filing.— Where more than six months had passed since the filing of an information charging defendant under former 31-18-5 NMSA 1978 et seq. with being an habitual offender, the supreme court ordered that it be dismissed with prejudice in accordance with Rule 37(d), N.M.R. Crim. P. (now Rule 5-604D), to the extent that the state was precluded only from filing another such information grounded upon all four of those felonies which were the basis for the information dismissed.State v. Lopez, 1976-NMSC-012, 89 N.M. 82, 547 P.2d 565(decided under former law) (now Rule 5-604 NMRA).\n\nRight to counsel.— The charge of being a habitual criminal is too serious, and the potential prejudice resulting from the absence of counsel having the legal skill to determine whether there had, in fact, been a previous conviction, is too great, to allow a conviction to stand when it appears a defendant has entered a plea without the assistance of counsel to which he is entitled, or without having effectively waived the right.Johnson v. Cox, 1963-NMSC-058, 72 N.M. 55, 380 P.2d 199, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 855, 84 S. Ct. 117, 11 L. Ed. 2d 82 (1963).\n\nDuty of trial court to inform defendant of rights.— Under this section the trial court must inform the defendant of the allegations contained in the information and of his right to be tried as to the truth thereof according to law. Therefore, where there was no showing that the judge or an officer of the court so informed the defendant, defendant's confession of being convicted of another crime was disallowed, and the judgment was reversed.State v. Bonner, 1974-NMCA-043, 86 N.M. 314, 523 P.2d 812.\n\nTrial court not specifically required to inform defendant of enhanced penalty.— This section does not specifically require the trial court to advise a defendant of the enhanced penalty.State v. Madrid, 1972-NMSC-016, 83 N.M. 603, 495 P.2d 383.\n\nTrial court's failure to caution not considered on appeal.— Where defendant claimed that the trial court's procedure prior to his admitting the charge of being an habitual offender was defective in that his admission could not legally be accepted because he was not duly cautioned as to his rights, but did not claim that his admission was involuntary, the issue of the trial court's failure to caution defendant would not be heard on appeal, since it was not raised in the trial court.State v. Jordan, 1975-NMCA-102, 88 N.M. 230, 539 P.2d 620.\n\nRight to trial by jury may be waived.— Right to be tried by a jury is a requirement which may be waived either expressly or by implication.State v. Knight, 1965-NMSC-058, 75 N.M. 197, 402 P.2d 380.\n\nCircumstances showing waiver of jury trial.— Where appellant was represented by an attorney throughout the proceedings, had ample notice that habitual criminal charges were involved, and, in reply to questions by the court before the guilty plea was accepted to the forgery charges and prior to any examination by the court concerning the habitual criminal information, both appellant and his attorney assured the court that they had previously discussed the habitual criminal information and that they had also thoroughly discussed it with the district attorney, appellant's right to be tried by a jury was waived.State v. Knight, 1965-NMSC-058, 75 N.M. 197, 402 P.2d 380.\n\nLaw requires admission or determination of identity.— Before defendant can be prosecuted under the habitual offender statute, the law requires an admission or a determination of identity.State v. Sanchez, 1972-NMCA-113, 84 N.M. 163, 500 P.2d 448.\n\nAn instruction which reads \"aka\" deprives defendant of jury determination.— An instruction which read \"aka\" (also known as) deprived defendant in a habitual offender prosecution of the right to have the jury determine the issue of identity.State v. Griffin, 1980-NMCA-015, 94 N.M. 5, 606 P.2d 543.\n\nUse of aliases in indictments or jury instructions is properwhere there is evidence of the alias and/or the surrounding circumstances reveal no resulting prejudice to the defendant.State v. Muniz, 1981-NMSC-014, 95 N.M. 415, 622 P.2d 1035.\n\nJury's function of determining identity issue not preempted by instructions.— Instructions which simply told the jury to determine whether defendant was the same person that was convicted of several offenses that were charged in the indictments under other names did not preempt the jury's function of determining the issue of identity in a prosecution under the habitual offender statute.State v. Muniz, 1981-NMSC-014, 95 N.M. 415, 622 P.2d 1035.\n\nJudicial determination of identitymay not properly be made prior to conviction in the felony case.Lott v. Cox, 1965-NMSC-037, 75 N.M. 102, 401 P.2d 93.\n\nWaiver of jury trial does not amount to admission of identity.— Even though defendant affirmatively waived a jury trial on the question of identity, this did not amount to an admission that he was the same person charged in the supplemental information.State v. Sanchez, 1972-NMCA-113, 84 N.M. 163, 500 P.2d 448.\n\nStatute does not provide jury trial where such trial was waived in original proceedings.— Where defendant seeks to retry, in an habitual offender proceeding, the question of voluntariness of guilty pleas he made a decade ago, and, although the validity of the prior convictions upon which the habitual offender charge is based is subject to attack, the purpose of the statute is not to provide a defendant with a trial by jury on previous convictions where the defendant waived such a trial in the original criminal proceedings.State v. Martinez, 1978-NMSC-083, 92 N.M. 256, 586 P.2d 1085.\n\nSequence of crimes and convictions is element of the state's caseand not a defense to be raised and established by the defendant; the state's failure to establish the sequence of the crimes is therefor a failure of proof.State v. Valenzuela, 1979-NMCA-072, 94 N.M. 285, 609 P.2d 1241,aff'd, 1980-NMSC-047, 94 N.M. 340, 610 P.2d 744,overruled in part byHernandez v. State, 1981-NMSC-091, 96 N.M. 585, 633 P.2d 693.\n\nDetermining when subsequent act occurred relevant.— When a question of the sequence of crimes and convictions is raised, the only relevant determination is the factual question of when the subsequent act occurs. Thus, \"sequence\" depends upon evidence actually presented to the jury.State v. Valenzuela, 1979-NMCA-072, 94 N.M. 285, 609 P.2d 1241,aff'd, 1980-NMSC-047, 94 N.M. 340, 610 P.2d 744,overruled in part byHernandez v. State, 1981-NMSC-091, 96 N.M. 585, 633 P.2d 693.\n\nState must present some evidence to carry burden of validly obtained pleas.— Although it is settled law that the absence of the record of the guilty plea proceedings does not establish the invalidity of the pleas, the state must present some evidence in order to carry its burden of persuasion that the pleas were validly obtained.State v. Garcia, 1980-NMSC-132, 95 N.M. 246, 620 P.2d 1271.\n\nWhere state's exhibits establish prima facie case establishing valid guilty plea,the defendant must then produce evidence that supports the asserted invalidity of these pleas.State v. Garcia, 1980-NMSC-132, 95 N.M. 246, 620 P.2d 1271.\n\nWhere defendant claims a guilty plea was invalid,the state makes a prima facie case establishing a valid guilty plea upon proof that defendant has been convicted of a crime.State v. Garcia, 1980-NMSC-132, 95 N.M. 246, 620 P.2d 1271.\n\nIssue of whether prior convictions are constitutionally valid is defenseto the habitual offender charge. Defendant was entitled to present evidence in support of this defense. Whether the defense is a matter to be decided by the court or the jury will depend on the issue raised by the defense.State v. Dawson, 1977-NMCA-102, 91 N.M. 70, 570 P.2d 608.\n\nCollateral attack on validity of prior convictions permissible.— Where defendant's appeal attacks the validity of two prior convictions on grounds: (1) that he did not have a preliminary examination in connection with the two prior convictions, and (2) that the first conviction was for a misdemeanor rather than a felony, such a collateral attack is permissible.State v. Darrah, 1966-NMSC-171, 76 N.M. 671, 417 P.2d 805.\n\nState not required to allege and prove validity of prior conviction.— This section does not require the state to prove the validity of the prior convictions. The state makes a prima facie case upon proof that defendant has been convicted of a prior felony.State v. Dawson, 1977-NMCA-102, 91 N.M. 70, 570 P.2d 608.\n\nValidity of prior convictions.— Where defendant moved for a directed verdict, contending that the state had failed to prove an essential element of the habitual offender charge, the assertedly missing essential element being that the prior convictions were valid, the motion was correctly denied. Validity of the prior convictions is a matter of defense. Until defendant raised an issue as to the validity of the prior convictions, validity was not an issue in the case. The state did not have the burden of proving the validity of the prior convictions.State v. Gallegos, 1977-NMCA-113, 91 N.M. 107, 570 P.2d 938.\n\nEvidence of prior convictions prima facie.— In a habitual offender proceeding, state exhibits showing the prior convictions make a prima facie case as to their prior convictions.State v. Garcia, 1978-NMCA-109, 92 N.M. 730, 594 P.2d 1186, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 591 P.2d 286 (1979).\n\nWhen validity of prior convictions becomes proper issue.— Until the defendant raises an issue as to the validity of prior convictions, \"validity\" is not an issue in the case.State v. O'Neil, 1978-NMCA-056, 91 N.M. 727, 580 P.2d 495, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 491, 576 P.2d 297 (decided under former 31-18-5 NMSA 1978).\n\nAsserted invalidity of prior convictions is defense to habitual offender charge.State v. O'Neil, 1978-NMCA-056, 91 N.M. 727, 580 P.2d 495, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 491, 576 P.2d 297.\n\nDefense of invalidity of prior conviction.— Invalidity of a prior conviction is a defense in a habitual offender proceeding and it is defendant's obligation to present evidence in support of this defense.State v. Garcia, 1978-NMCA-109, 92 N.M. 730, 594 P.2d 1186, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 591 P.2d 286 (1979).\n\nValidity of prior guilty pleas is an issue to be decided by the courtin an habitual offender proceeding.State v. O'Neil, 1978-NMCA-056, 91 N.M. 727, 580 P.2d 495, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 491, 576 P.2d 297.\n\nThe view that all issues of validity are to be decided by the jury in an habitual offender proceeding cannot be subscribed to, particularly where the attack on the prior convictions goes to the validity of defendant's guilty pleas.State v. Martinez, 1978-NMSC-083, 92 N.M. 256, 586 P.2d 1085.\n\nBurden in habitual offender proceeding on defendantto produce evidence that a guilty plea in a previous proceeding was not voluntary or intelligent.State v. Garcia, 1978-NMCA-109, 92 N.M. 730, 594 P.2d 1186, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 591 P.2d 286 (1979).\n\nState not required to carry burden on validity of plea where record silent.— A trial court errs in placing an affirmative burden on the state when the \"record is silent\" concerning the validity of prior guilty pleas.State v. O'Neil, 1978-NMCA-056, 91 N.M. 727, 580 P.2d 495, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 491, 576 P.2d 297.\n\nBurdens of production of evidence and of persuasion distinguished.— Where defendant's claim of invalidity is raised as a defense to a habitual offender charge, defendant must provide evidence in support of his defense. Once he does so, he is not required to persuade the fact finder concerning his defense; rather, the state has the burden of persuasion because it is the state, not defendant, who must prove a case.State v. O'Neil, 1978-NMCA-056, 91 N.M. 727, 580 P.2d 495, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 491, 576 P.2d 297.\n\nNoncompliance with Rule 21(e), N.M.R. Crim. P. (now Rule 5-303 NMRA) is not basis for attacking validity of guilty pleasto prior felonies in habitual offender proceedings.State v. Gallegos, 1977-NMCA-113, 91 N.M. 107, 570 P.2d 938.\n\nJudgment of sister state admissible.— Admission of an Oklahoma judgment of two prior felonies was proper. The judgment was not inadmissible hearsay, and its admission was not a violation of the constitutional right to confront witnesses.State v. Whiteshield, 1977-NMCA-103, 91 N.M. 96, 570 P.2d 927, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 4, 569 P.2d 414.\n\nEffect of filing notice of appeal.— Where defendant was charged by supplemental information with being the same person who had been convicted of two felonies and who therefore should be sentenced as an habitual offender, and the jury found that the defendant was the same person who committed both offenses, defendant's contention that the trial court lost jurisdiction after the notice of appeal was filed on the second felony conviction and could not hear the issue to be tried on the supplemental information was without merit. The trial court had jurisdiction to impose sentence, since sentencing, in some prescribed statutory form, was a mandatory requirement of the Criminal Code - appeal or no appeal. If the appeal of the second conviction was affirmed the enhanced sentence would stand. In the event of reversal, the conviction and sentence would be vacated.State v. Lujan, 1977-NMCA-093, 90 N.M. 778, 568 P.2d 614.\n\nClaim not made in trial court not considered on appeal.— Defendant claimed on appeal that the charge against him for being an habitual offender was defective for failure to name a specific subsection of the statute, but since no such claim was made in the trial court, it would not be considered on appeal.State v. Jordan, 1975-NMCA-102, 88 N.M. 230, 539 P.2d 620.\n\nProcedural requirements of this section were metand record showed that supplemental information, which sought an enhanced sentence, was read in open court with defendant present, that defendant admitted to being the person convicted as charged in the supplemental information, and that this occurred when defendant was represented by counsel who, immediately after the enhanced sentence was imposed, informed the court that defendant desired to appeal and requested that a bond be set pending the outcome of the appeal.State v. Madrid, 1972-NMSC-016, 83 N.M. 603, 495 P.2d 383.\n\nIII. SENTENCES.\n\nDuty of court to impose sentence enhancement.— The court has an affirmative duty to impose the appropriate level of sentence enhancement once the factual issues of identity and prior convictions are resolved against the respondent.State v. Davis, 1986-NMSC-031, 104 N.M. 229, 719 P.2d 807.\n\nJurisdiction of trial court to sentenceis not exhausted until sentence is pronounced, and will carry over from term to term.Pavlich v. State, 1968-NMSC-147, 79 N.M. 473, 444 P.2d 984.\n\nEnhanced sentence may be imposed only in last felony case.— Even though identity is determined in a separate cause, the enhanced sentence may only be imposed in the last case in which the accused was convicted of a felony in this state.State v. Tipton, 1966-NMSC-202, 77 N.M. 1, 419 P.2d 216.\n\nIdentity established.— Regardless of whether the identity is determined in a separate case or in a separate proceeding in the felony case following conviction therein, if such identity is established, the enhanced sentence required by the Habitual Criminal Act may only be imposed in the felony case.Lott v. Cox, 1965-NMSC-037, 75 N.M. 102, 401 P.2d 93.\n\nSentence imposed in habitual criminal proceeding void.— Where defendant's identity as the person previously convicted of two felonies was established in a separate proceeding, and the enhanced sentence was also imposed, the sentence was a nullity and the commitment issued therein is void, as the sentence should have been imposed in the last felony case.State v. Tipton, 1966-NMSC-202, 77 N.M. 1, 419 P.2d 216.\n\nDefendant may be returned for imposition of proper sentence.— Where defendant has been legally convicted, but no judgment or sentence has been imposed, and defendant's identity as an habitual offender has been established and he was sentenced, defendant's restraint is illegal because sentence was imposed in the wrong case. In such a situation, defendant may be returned to the trial court for imposition of a proper sentence.State v. Tipton, 1966-NMSC-202, 77 N.M. 1, 419 P.2d 216.\n\nMurder sentences.— A sentence in a cause charging violation of the habitual offender statute by a defendant who pleaded guilty to two murder charges is void and he should be remanded for sentencing in the murder cases.Miller v. Cox, 1965-NMSC-031, 75 N.M. 65, 400 P.2d 480.\n\nPrevious regular sentences vacated and enhanced sentences imposed.— Where regular sentences were imposed upon defendants prior to the time their status as habitual offenders was determined, the regular sentences are to be vacated and the enhanced sentences are to be imposed.State v. Baker, 1977-NMCA-033, 90 N.M. 291, 562 P.2d 1145.\n\nCorrecting and vacating sentence.— Although the sentence of the court in the felony case was incomplete until the resentence, as the previous sentence was not vacated and the mandatory statutory increased punishment imposed as required by law, there is no reason, constitutional or otherwise, why the court which imposed sentence may not correct what it did wrongly by vacating the sentence for breaking and entering and imposing the mandatory sentence in place of the one vacated.State v. Gonzales, 1972-NMCA-130, 84 N.M. 275, 502 P.2d 300, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 271, 502 P.2d 296.\n\nThere is no requirement of law that the punishment for the felony of which accused was convicted be first imposed and then vacated in order to impose the increased punishment prescribed by the habitual offender statute.Lott v. Cox, 1965-NMSC-037, 75 N.M. 102, 401 P.2d 93.\n\nStatute does not require that sentence be first imposedin the felony conviction and then vacated before the increased punishment prescribed by the habitual offender statute may be imposed.State v. Bonner, 1970-NMCA-047, 81 N.M. 471, 468 P.2d 636.\n\nArrangement of manner in which enhanced sentence will be served.— In imposing the new enhanced sentences, the trial court's arrangement of the manner in which the new enhanced sentences will be served is not limited by the arrangement for serving the regular sentences which should have been vacated.State v. Baker, 1977-NMCA-033, 90 N.M. 291, 562 P.2d 1145.\n\nChange from suspended sentence to sentence to be served.— Inasmuch as the trial court had no authority to suspend the enhanced sentence, a change from a suspended sentence to a sentence to be served when sentence as a habitual offender was imposed was proper.State v. Baker, 1977-NMCA-033, 90 N.M. 291, 562 P.2d 1145.\n\nRight to counsel.— An indigent defendant facing the imposition of penalties under the habitual criminal statutes is entitled to have an attorney appointed to represent him in such hearing. There is no requirement that such appointed attorney be the same attorney that represented the indigent defendant in the proceeding which resulted in the Habitual Criminal Act becoming applicable. This is so even though the habitual criminal proceedings may be filed in the same action. Such being the case, it necessarily follows that the question of identity of the attorney in the two proceedings is of no consequence and that the court may pay him for his services in the initial proceeding and in the habitual criminal proceeding as well. 1966 Op.

      "text": "A. Whenever an inmate in a penal institution of this state or of any county therein is sentenced for committing any felony while he is an inmate, the sentence imposed shall be consecutive to the sentence being served, and his period of parole shall be that set according to the provisions of Section 31-21-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. Any person, who commits a crime while at large under a suspended or deferred sentence or probation or parole, and who is convicted and sentenced therefor, shall serve the sentence consecutive to the remainder of the term, including remaining parole time, under which he was released unless otherwise ordered by the court in sentencing for the new crime.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 40A-29-34, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 216, § 10.\n\nIntent of legislature.— Construing Subsection A of this section together with the other sentencing statutes in the Criminal Sentencing Act leads to the inescapable conclusion that the legislature intended to impose harsher and more certain punishment on inmates who commit crimes while incarcerated.State v. Davis, 2003-NMSC-022, 134 N.M. 172, 74 P.3d 1064.\n\nThe legislature intended sentencing courts to stack the sentences of inmates who are convicted of crimes while incarcerated.State v. Davis, 2003-NMSC-022, 134 N.M. 172, 74 P.3d 1064.\n\nPrison disciplinary measures do not bar subsequent prosecutionin a criminal action for violation of a penal statute prohibiting the same act which was the basis of the person's discipline.Washington v. Rodriguez, 1971-NMCA-021, 82 N.M. 428, 483 P.2d 309.\n\nConsecutive sentences proper.— Court may, at its discretion, impose consecutive sentences.State v. Frederick, 1964-NMSC-045, 74 N.M. 42, 390 P.2d 281.\n\nModification of sentences in parole revocation.— In a parole revocation, the court may only modify an existing sentence. When the existing sentence is consecutive to a previous sentence, the court may make the existing sentence concurrent because doing so does not increase the sentence. However, the court may not change a sentence that was originally concurrent to be consecutive because doing so would increase the sentence. In a first sentence, however, Subsection B of Section 31-18-21 NMSA 1978 is never applicable and the sentence cannot be made concurrent or consecutive with a later sentence as a result of probation violation because for a first sentence there is no concurrent or consecutive status to be modified. To hold otherwise would allow probation revocations for previous convictions to undermine concurrent or consecutive sentences for later convictions.State v. Rapchack, 2011-NMCA-116, 150 N.M. 716, 265 P.3d 1289, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-010.\n\nSubsection B of Section 31-18-21 NMSA 1978 applies to sentences as originally imposed.The order of probation revocation does not change the character or original order of the sentences.State v. Rapchack, 2011-NMCA-116, 150 N.M. 716, 265 P.3d 1289, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-010.\n\nModification of multiple sentences in parole revocation.— Where defendant pleaded guilty to burglary of a vehicle and the first judge suspended defendant's sentence; defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to auto-theft related crimes before a second judge and the second judge suspended defendant's sentence and ordered the sentence to be served consecutive to the sentence in the burglary case; defendant was later arrested for a third crime; in 2008, the second judge revoked defendant's probation in the auto-theft case; in 2009, first judge revoked defendant's probation in the burglary case and ordered that the sentence in the burglary case be served concurrently with the sentence in the auto-theft case; and the first judge later corrected the order to state that the sentence in the burglary case would not run concurrently with the sentence in the auto-theft case, the order making the sentence in the burglary case concurrent with the sentence in the auto-theft case was contrary to law and the first judge had the power to correct the order, because the sentence in the burglary case was the first sentence, the first sentence could not originally have been concurrent with or consecutive to anything and could not be modified to become concurrent or consecutive.State v. Rapchack, 2011-NMCA-116, 150 N.M. 716, 265 P.3d 1289, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-010.\n\nSentencing judge has no discretionunder this section regarding whether a sentence is to be served consecutively or concurrently. The legislature's use of the word \"shall\" in Subsection A makes consecutive sentencing mandatory.State v. Davis, 2003-NMSC-022, 134 N.M. 172, 74 P.3d 1064.\n\nSection alters common-law rule.— The common-law rule is that in the absence of statute two or more sentences are to be served concurrently unless otherwise ordered by the court. This section alters the common-law rule only as to crimes committed while at large under a sentence for a prior crime.Deats v. State, 1972-NMCA-155, 84 N.M. 405, 503 P.2d 1183.\n\nUnless court orders otherwise, section postpones stated beginning dateof new sentence until the prior sentence is completed.Herring v. State, 1969-NMCA-117, 81 N.M. 21, 462 P.2d 468.\n\nBeginning date of sentence.— Sentence imposed upon defendant while he was on parole from prior sentence ran consecutive to prior sentence although trial court stated beginning date for new sentence but did not order that it run concurrently with prior sentence.Herring v. State, 1969-NMCA-117, 81 N.M. 21, 462 P.2d 468.\n\nAlthough the beginning date of the new sentences imposed following conviction of forgery was stated in the commitment of defendant on parole, that beginning date was postponed by this section where the trial court did not order otherwise; further, the record showed that the court did not intend the sentences for the three forgeries to run concurrently with any other sentence imposed upon defendant.State v. Upshaw, 1968-NMCA-070, 79 N.M. 484, 444 P.2d 995.\n\nEffect of return of defendant to penitentiary before trial.— Defendant's assertion that the district court lost jurisdiction over him because he was \"released\" to the penitentiary for parole violation before being tried did not raise any issue of illegality. The parole authorities could revoke defendant's parole and return him to the penitentiary for a parole violation, and this section clearly contemplates the conviction and sentence of a person for a crime committed while at large under parole.State v. Ford, 1970-NMCA-061, 81 N.M. 556, 469 P.2d 535.\n\n\"Presentence\" confinement credit not allowed.— This section mandates that a sentence for a felony committed while serving a sentence in a penal institution run consecutive to the prior sentence. It is impossible to grant \"presentence\" confinement credit concurrent with time served on the prior sentence and comply with this section, which requires that the sentences run consecutively.State v. Facteau, 1990-NMSC-040, 109 N.M. 748, 790 P.2d 1029.\n\nDiscretionary award of presentence confinement credit for offense committed while on probation.— Since defendant was outside of a penal institution on parole when he committed a second offense (possession of drug paraphernalia), the sentencing judge had discretion under Subsection B to make defendant's sentence run concurrent or consecutive to any sentence defendant was then serving for a parole violation, including the authority to award presentence confinement credit on the facts of the case.State v. Irvin, 1992-NMCA-121, 114 N.M. 597, 844 P.2d 847.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Proposed New Mexico Criminal Code,\" see 1 Nat. Resources J. 122 (1961).\n\nAm.
