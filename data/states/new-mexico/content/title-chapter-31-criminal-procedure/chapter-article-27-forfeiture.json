      "text": "A. The purposes of the Forfeiture Act are to:\n\n(1) make uniform the standards and procedures for the seizure and forfeiture of property subject to forfeiture;\n\n(2) protect the constitutional rights of persons whose property is subject to forfeiture and of innocent owners holding interests in property subject to forfeiture;\n\n(3) deter criminal activity by reducing its economic incentives;\n\n(4) increase the pecuniary loss from criminal activity;\n\n(5) protect against the wrongful forfeiture of property; and\n\n(6) ensure that only criminal forfeiture is allowed in this state and only pursuant to state law.\n\nB. The Forfeiture Act:\n\n(1) applies to all seizures, forfeitures and dispositions of property subject to forfeiture pursuant to laws that specifically apply the Forfeiture Act in this state; and\n\n(2) does not apply to:\n\n(a) contraband, which is subject to seizure pursuant to applicable state laws, but is not subject to forfeiture pursuant to the Forfeiture Act;\n\n(b) animals that are subject to seizure, impoundment, alteration, permanent removal from custody or destruction for animal welfare, public health and safety or compliance and enforcement purposes pursuant to applicable state and local laws;\n\n(c) real property or personal property that is located on that real property that is subject to destruction pursuant to state and local laws to protect public health and safety; and\n\n(d) forfeiture that results from a lien for charges or assessments that are provided for or fixed by state or local laws.\n\nHistory:Laws 2002, ch. 4, § 2; 2015, ch. 152, § 2; 2019, ch. 133, § 1.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective April 2, 2019, clarified that the purposes of the Forfeiture Act are to ensure that only criminal forfeiture is allowed in this state and only pursuant to state law, and revised the applicability provisions of the Forfeiture Act; in Subsection A, in Paragraph A(6), after \"in this state\", added \"and only pursuant to state law\"; and in Subsection B, in Paragraph B(1), after \"applies to\", added \"all\", after \"the Forfeiture Act\", added \"in this state\", and in Paragraph B(2), added subparagraph designation \"(a)\" and new Subparagraphs B(2)(b) through B(2)(d).\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2019, ch. 133, § 13 provided that the provisions of the Forfeiture Act apply to seized and abandoned property in the possession of a law enforcement agency or the state treasurer on and after April 2, 2019.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2019, ch. 133, § 11 provided that the New Mexico supreme court shall issue procedural court rules to implement the provisions of this act.\n\nLaws 2019, ch. 133, § 12 provided that abandoned property in the possession of a law enforcement agency or the state treasurer on April 2, 2019 shall be disposed of pursuant to Section 29-1-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective July 1, 2015, provided for additional purposes of the Forfeiture Act; removed the reference to seizures and forfeitures pursuant to other laws consistent with the Forfeiture Act; in the catchline, added \"no additional remedies\"; at the end of Paragraph (1) of Subsection A, deleted \"and\"; in Paragraph (2) of Subsection A, after \"rights of persons\", deleted \"accused of a crime\" and added \"whose property is subject to forfeiture\", and after \"innocent\", deleted \"persons\" and added \"owners\"; added new Paragraphs (3) through (6) of Subsection A; and in Subsection B, deleted all the language in Paragraph (2) and added the new language.\n\nCivil forfeiture ordinance preempted by New Mexico Forfeiture Act.— Where the City of Santa Fe (city) appealed the district court's order directing the return of claimant's car, which was seized pursuant to the city's forfeiture ordinance, which provides that a motor vehicle is declared to be a nuisance and subject to immediate forfeiture if the vehicle is operated by a person in the commission of a DWI offense or by a person whose license is suspended or revoked as a result of a DWI arrest, the New Mexico Forfeiture Act (NMFA), §§ 31-27-1 to 31-27-11 NMSA 1978, a general law that is intended to ensure that only criminal forfeiture is allowed in this state, expressly denies municipalities' authority to enforce civil asset forfeiture proceedings. The NMFA comprehensively addresses asset forfeiture, and because the city's civil forfeiture ordinance is at odds with the NMFA, the NMFA preempts the ordinance.City of Santa Fe ex rel. Santa Fe Police Dep't v. 1989 Black Saab Sedan, 2019-NMCA-028, cert. denied.\n\nForfeiture of cash.— State police officers who seize cash under the authority of the Controlled Substances Act are required to comply with the requirements of the Forfeiture Act.Albin v.

The NMFA comprehensively addresses asset forfeiture, and because the city's civil forfeiture ordinance is at odds with the NMFA, the NMFA preempts the ordinance.Espinoza v. City of Albuquerque, 2019-NMCA-014.\n\nNew Mexico Forfeiture Act preempts municipal forfeiture ordinance.— A state law preempts a local ordinance if the local ordinance interferes with the state law's objectives or purposes, and one of the New Mexico Forfeiture Act's (NMFA) stated purposes is to ensure that only criminal forfeiture is allowed in New Mexico. This purpose limiting forfeitures to criminal actions is expressly at odds with the city of Albuquerque's civil forfeiture ordinance. The NMFA also states that one of its purposes is to make uniform the standards and procedures for the seizure and forfeiture of property subject to forfeiture. The New Mexico legislature's desire for uniformity in the standards and procedures also suggests that it intends to supplant local forfeiture laws, which might have different standards and procedures.Harjo v. City of Albuquerque, 307 F.Supp.3d 1163 (D. N.M. 2018).",

A person's property is subject to forfeiture pursuant to state law if:\n\n(1) the person was arrested for an offense to which forfeiture applies;\n\n(2) the person is convicted by a criminal court of the offense; and\n\n(3) the state establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture as provided in Subsection B of this section.\n\nB.

The execution on the order to seize the property and the return of the property, if applicable, are subject to the Forfeiture Act and other applicable state laws. Before issuing an order pursuant to this subsection, the court shall make a determination that:\n\n(1) there is a substantial probability that:\n\n(a) the property is subject to forfeiture;\n\n(b) the state will prevail on the issue of forfeiture; and\n\n(c) failure to enter the order will result in the property being destroyed, removed from the state or otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture; and\n\n(2) the need to preserve the availability of the property through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship to the owner and other parties known to be claiming interests in the property.\n\nE. Property subject to forfeiture may be seized at any time, without a prior court order, if:\n\n(1) the seizure is incident to a lawful arrest for a crime or a search lawfully conducted pursuant to a search warrant and the law enforcement officer making the arrest or executing the search has probable cause to believe the property is subject to forfeiture and that the subject of the arrest or search warrant is an owner of the property;\n\n(2) the property subject to seizure is the subject of a previous judgment in favor of the state; or\n\n(3) the law enforcement officer making the seizure has probable cause to believe the property is subject to forfeiture and that the delay occasioned by the need to obtain a court order would result in the removal or destruction of the property or otherwise frustrate the seizure.\n\nHistory:Laws 2002, ch. 4, § 4; 2015, ch. 152, § 4; 2019, ch. 133, § 3.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective April 2, 2019, clarified that the purposes of the Forfeiture Act are to ensure that only criminal forfeiture is allowed in this state and only pursuant to state law, and clarified that nothing in this section prohibits forfeitures by the terms of a plea agreement to a felony that is approved by a court or by other agreement of the parties to a criminal proceeding; in Subsection A, in the introductory clause, after \"subject to forfeiture\", added \"pursuant to state law\"; and in Subsection C, after \"plea agreement\", added \"to a felony\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2019, ch. 133, § 13 provided that the provisions of the Forfeiture Act apply to seized and abandoned property in the possession of a law enforcement agency or the state treasurer on and after April 2, 2019.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2019, ch. 133, § 11 provided that the New Mexico supreme court shall issue procedural court rules to implement the provisions of this act.\n\nLaws 2019, ch. 133, § 12 provided that abandoned property in the possession of a law enforcement agency or the state treasurer on April 2, 2019 shall be disposed of pursuant to Section 29-1-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective July 1, 2015, provided that a conviction of a criminal offense is required before property is subject to forfeiture; in the catchline, added \"Forfeiture; conviction required\", and \"with process; without process\"; at the beginning of the section, deleted \"Property may be seized by a law enforcement officer:\"; in former Subsection A, deleted \"pursuant to an order of seizure issued by a district court based on a sworn application of a law enforcement officer from which a determination is made by the court\"; added new Subsections A through C; added Subsection D with an introductory paragraph; designated Paragraphs (1) and (2) of former Subsection A as Paragraphs (1) and (2) of Subsection D; designated former Subsection B as Subsection E and added \"Property subject to forfeiture may be seized at any time\", after \"court order, if\", deleted \"the property alleged to be property subject to forfeiture is not a residence or a business, when\"; in Paragraph (1) of Subsection E, after \"incident to\", deleted \"an\" and added \"a lawful\", after \"arrest for a crime\", added \"or\", after \"search\", added \"lawfully\", after \"search warrant\", deleted \"or an inspection conducted pursuant to an administrative inspection warrant\", after \"executing the search\", deleted \"or inspection warrant\" in two places, after \"believe the property\", deleted \"to be property\" and added \"is\", after \"subject to arrest\", added \"or\", after \"search warrant\", deleted \"or inspection warrant\", after the semicolon, deleted \"or\"; added a new Paragraph (2) of Subsection E and redesignated the succeeding paragraph accordingly; and in Paragraph (3) of Subsection E, after \"property is\", deleted \"property\", and after \"court order would\", added \"result in the removal or destruction of the property or otherwise\".\n\nCivil forfeiture ordinance preempted by New Mexico Forfeiture Act.— Where the City of Santa Fe (City) appealed the district court's order directing the return of claimant's car, which was seized pursuant to the City's forfeiture ordinance, which provides that a motor vehicle is declared to be a nuisance and subject to immediate forfeiture if the vehicle is operated by a person in the commission of a DWI offense or by a person whose license is suspended or revoked as a result of a DWI arrest, the New Mexico Forfeiture Act (NMFA), NMSA 1978, §§ 31-27-1 to -11, a general law that is intended to ensure that only criminal forfeiture is allowed in this state, expressly denies municipalities' authority to enforce civil asset forfeiture proceedings.

Benally, 2016-NMSC-010,aff'g2015-NMCA-053, 348 P.3d 1039.\n\nWhere law enforcement officers seized, impounded and sealed a vehicle belonging to defendant, officers \"seized\" the vehicle and also made a seizure of the contents of the vehicle because it deprived defendant of his possessory interests in them; where officers filed a forfeiture complaint thirty-four days after seizing defendant's property, but within thirty days of discovering a large amount of currency in defendant's vehicle, the forfeiture complaint was untimely because the state, under the former version of the statute, was required to file the forfeiture complaint within thirty days of when the state first interfered with defendant's property interests in the contents of the vehicle, including the money subject to the forfeiture complaint.State v. Benally, 2016-NMSC-010,aff'g2015-NMCA-053, 348 P.3d 1039.\n\nTriggering event for 30-day time limit.— The legislature intended forfeiture complaints to be filed within thirty days of the date the state takes possession of the subject property, rather than when the property subject to forfeiture may have been discovered.State v. Benally, 2015-NMCA-053, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-005.\n\nWhere officers impounded defendant's vehicle, searched the vehicle six days later and discovered certain property subject to forfeiture, filed a complaint for forfeiture 28 days after discovering the subject property, but 34 days after seizing the vehicle which contained the subject property, the court of appeals held that because the officers meaningfully interfered with defendant's possessory interests, the impoundment of the vehicle was a seizure of the vehicle, and the contents of the vehicle were also seized by virtue of being in the impounded vehicle, and therefore the thirty-day time limit began to run when the officers impounded defendant's car and its contents, rather than when the subject property was discovered, the state failed to file a complaint for forfeiture within thirty days of the seizure and the district court properly dismissed the forfeiture action.State v. Benally, 2015-NMCA-053, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-005.",

      "text": "A. A person who claims an interest in seized property shall file a response within thirty days of the date of service of the notice of intent to forfeit. The response shall include facts to support the claimant's alleged interest in the property.\n\nB. The district courts have jurisdiction over forfeiture proceedings, and venue for a forfeiture proceeding is in the same court in which venue lies for the criminal matter related to the seized property.\n\nC. The forfeiture proceeding shall begin after the conclusion of the trial for the related criminal matter in an ancillary proceeding that relates to a defendant's property before the same judge and jury, if applicable, and the court, and the jury, if applicable, may consider the forfeiture of property seized from other persons at the same time or in a later proceeding. If the criminal defendant in the related criminal matter is represented by the public defender department, the chief public defender or the district public defender may authorize department representation of the defendant in the forfeiture proceeding.\n\nD. Discovery conducted in an ancillary forfeiture proceeding is subject to the rules of criminal procedure.\n\nE. An ancillary forfeiture proceeding that relates to the forfeiture of property valued at less than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) shall be held before a judge only.\n\nF. If the state fails to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that a person whose property is alleged to be subject to forfeiture is an owner of the property:\n\n(1) the forfeiture proceeding shall be dismissed and the property shall be delivered to the owner, unless the owner's possession of the property is illegal; and\n\n(2) the owner shall not be subject to any charges by the state for storage of the property or expenses incurred in the preservation of the property.\n\nG. The court shall enter a judgment of forfeiture and the seized property shall be forfeited to the state if the state proves by clear and convincing evidence that:\n\n(1) the seized property is subject to forfeiture;\n\n(2) the criminal prosecution of the owner of the seized property resulted in a conviction; and\n\n(3) the value of the property to be forfeited does not unreasonably exceed:\n\n(a) the pecuniary gain derived or sought to be derived by the crime;\n\n(b) the pecuniary loss caused or sought to be caused by the crime; or\n\n(c) the value of the convicted owner's interest in the property.\n\nH. A court shall not accept a plea agreement or other arrangement by which a defendant contributes or donates property to a person, charity or other organization in full or partial fulfillment of responsibility established in the court's proceeding.\n\nI. Following a person's conviction, the state may make a motion for forfeiture of substitute property owned by the person that is equal to but does not exceed the value of the property that is subject to forfeiture but that the state is unable to seize. The court shall order the forfeiture of substitute property only if the state proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the person intentionally transferred, sold or deposited property with a third party to avoid the court's jurisdiction and the forfeiture of the property.\n\nJ. A person is not jointly and severally liable for orders for forfeiture of another person's property. When ownership of property is unclear, a court may order each person to forfeit the person's property on a pro rata basis or by another means the court deems equitable.\n\nK. Within the time period for filing an appeal following the conclusion of a forfeiture proceeding, the person whose property was forfeited may petition the court to determine whether the forfeiture was unconstitutionally excessive pursuant to the state or federal constitution.\n\nL. At a non-jury hearing on the petition, the petitioner has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the forfeiture was grossly disproportional to the seriousness of the criminal offense for which the person was convicted.\n\nM. In determining whether the forfeiture is unconstitutionally excessive, the court may consider all relevant factors, including:\n\n(1) the seriousness of the criminal offense and its impact on the community, the duration of the criminal activity and the harm caused by the defendant;\n\n(2) the extent to which the defendant participated in the offense;\n\n(3) the extent to which the property was used in committing the offense;\n\n(4) the sentence imposed for the commission of the crime that relates to the property that is subject to forfeiture; and\n\n(5) whether the criminal offense was completed or attempted.\n\nN. In determining the value of the property subject to forfeiture, the court may consider relevant factors, including the fair market value of the property and the hardship from the loss of a primary residence, motor vehicle or other property to the defendant's family members or others if the property is forfeited, in addition to any non-monetary intrinsic value of property that would cause the defendant to suffer if the forfeiture is realized.\n\nO. The court shall not consider the value of the property to the state when it determines whether the forfeiture of the property is constitutionally excessive.\n\nP. A party to a forfeiture proceeding may appeal a district court's decision regarding the seizure, forfeiture and distribution of property.\n\nHistory:Laws 2002, ch. 4, § 6; 2015, ch. 152, § 7; 2019, ch. 133, § 6.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective April 2, 2019, revised procedures related to forfeiture proceedings; in Subsection A, after \"shall file\", deleted \"an answer to the complaint of forfeiture\" and added \"a response\", after \"date of service of the\", deleted \"complaint\" and added \"notice of intent to forfeit\", and after \"The\", deleted \"answer\" and added \"response\"; in Subsection G, in Paragraph G(1), after \"the\", added \"seized\"; in Subsection K, after the subsection designation, deleted \"At any time\" and added \"Within the time period for filing an appeal\"; in Subsection N, deleted paragraph designation \"(1)\", deleted former Paragraph N(2) and deleted paragraph designation \"(3)\", and after \"if the property is forfeited,\", added \"in addition to any non-monetary intrinsic value of property that would cause the defendant to suffer if the forfeiture is realized\"; and in Subsection P, after \"distribution of property\", deleted \"pursuant to the Forfeiture Act\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2019, ch. 133, § 13 provided that the provisions of the Forfeiture Act apply to seized and abandoned property in the possession of a law enforcement agency or the state treasurer on and after April 2, 2019.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2019, ch. 133, § 11 provided that the New Mexico supreme court shall issue procedural court rules to implement the provisions of this act.\n\nLaws 2019, ch. 133, § 12 provided that abandoned property in the possession of a law enforcement agency or the state treasurer on April 2, 2019 shall be disposed of pursuant to Section 29-1-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective July 1, 2015, amended the procedures in forfeiture proceedings; in the catchline, deleted \"Court hearing and\" and added \"forfeiture proceedings\" and \"substitution of property; constitutionality; appeal\"; in Subsection A, added \"A person who\", after \"claims\", deleted \"to the\" and added \"an interest in seized\", after \"property shall\", deleted \"be filed by way of\" and added \"file an\", after \"complaint of forfeiture\", deleted \"and shall be filed\", and added the last sentence; in Subsection B, after \"criminal matter\", deleted \"for which\" and added \"related to\", after \"the\", added \"seized\", and after \"property\", deleted \"is alleged to be subject to forfeiture\"; in Subsection C, after \"proceeding shall\", deleted \"be brought in the same proceeding as the criminal matter and presented to the same trier of fact; provided\" and deleted Paragraphs (1) and (2) and the paragraph designation for Paragraph (3), added \"begin after the conclusion of the trial for the related criminal matter in an ancillary proceeding that relates to a defendant's property before the same judge and jury, if applicable, and the court, and the jury, if applicable, may consider the forfeiture of property seized from other persons at the same time or in a later proceeding\", and after \"If the criminal defendant\", added \"in the related criminal matter\"; added new Subsections D and E and redesignated former Subsections D and E as Subsections F and G, respectively; in Subsection F, after \"evidence, that\", deleted \"the\" and added \"a\", after \"person\", deleted \"charged with the crime for which the\" and added \"whose\", after \"alleged to be\", deleted \"property, and after \"subject to forfeiture is\", deleted \"the\" and added \"an\"; in Paragraph (1) of Subsection F, after \"unless\", added \"the owner's\"; in Subsection G, after \"forfeiture and the\", added \"seized\"; in Paragraph (2) of Subsection G, after \"owner\", deleted \"has\" and added \"of the seized property\"; and added new Subsections H through P.",
