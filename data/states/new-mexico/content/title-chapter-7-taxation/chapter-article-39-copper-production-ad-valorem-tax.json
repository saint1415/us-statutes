A property, which has been valued in accordance with the Copper Production Ad Valorem Tax Act in any preceding year and which is permanently shut down on or before January 1 of any year for which a valuation is to be made under the Copper Production Ad Valorem Tax Act, is no longer subject to the Copper Production Ad Valorem Tax Act and is subject instead to the provisions of the Property Tax Code [Chapter 7, Articles 35 through 38 NMSA 1978].\n\nC.

This subsection applies only to copper mineral properties with respect to which the owner, as part of the annual report to the department, declares for the tax year for which valuation is being determined or has declared for any prior tax year that a copper mineral property will remain in operation for a period less than four years and will not be replaced or reconstructed:\n\n(1) the valuation of a copper mineral property subject to this subsection shall be the value determined under Subsection A of this section for that property multiplied by:\n\n(a) twenty-five percent for properties with an anticipated operating period of less than one year as of the beginning of the tax year for which valuation is being determined;\n\n(b) forty-five percent for properties with an anticipated operating period of at least one year but less than two years as of the beginning of the tax year for which valuation is being determined;\n\n(c) sixty percent for properties with an anticipated operating period of at least two years but less than three years as of the beginning of the tax year for which valuation is being determined; and\n\n(d) seventy-five percent for properties with an anticipated operating period of at least three years but less than four years as of the beginning of the tax year for which valuation is being determined; and\n\n(2) if the owner declared in a prior annual report that the copper mineral property would remain in operation for a period less than four years and the owner, in the annual report for the tax year for which valuation is being determined, does not declare that the property will remain in operation for a period less than four years, declares that permanent shutdown is not anticipated within four years or declares that permanent shutdown is anticipated in a year subsequent to the year declared in the prior tax year, there shall be added to the property's valuation determined under Subsection A of this section or Paragraph (1) of this subsection, as appropriate, one hundred percent of:\n\n(a) if the owner fails to make a declaration or declares that the property will remain in operation for a period of at least four years, the difference between the valuation for the property determined solely under Subsection A of this section for each prior tax year in which the owner had declared the property would remain in operation for a period less than four years and the respective valuations in those prior tax years determined under this subsection; or\n\n(b) if the year of anticipated permanent shutdown declared in the prior tax year annual report is earlier than that in the subsequent annual report, the difference between the valuation for the prior tax year determined under this subsection using the later date of anticipated permanent shutdown and the valuation for that prior tax year determined under this subsection in that prior tax year; and\n\n(3) when value is added pursuant to Paragraph (2) of this subsection to the valuation otherwise determined for the copper mineral property, the property owner shall pay interest at the rate determined under Section 7-1-67 NMSA 1978 on the additional taxes due and penalty at the rate determined under Subsection A of Section 7-1-69 NMSA 1978. The interest and penalty shall be measured from the dates that the taxes were due to have been paid for the tax year from which the additional valuation derived.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 7-39-4, enacted by Laws 1990, ch. 125, § 11.",
