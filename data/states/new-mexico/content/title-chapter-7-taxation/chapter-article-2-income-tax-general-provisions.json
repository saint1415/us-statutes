For the purposes of this section:\n\n(1) \"required annual payment\" means the lesser of:\n\n(a) ninety percent of the tax shown on the return of the taxable year or, if no return is filed, ninety percent of the tax for the taxable year; or\n\n(b) one hundred percent of the tax shown on the return for the preceding taxable year if the preceding taxable year was a taxable year of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a New Mexico tax return for that preceding taxable year; and\n\n(2) \"tax\" means the tax imposed under Section 7-2-3 NMSA 1978 less any amount allowed for applicable credits and rebates provided by the Income Tax Act.\n\nC. There shall be four required installments for each taxable year. If a taxpayer is not liable for estimated tax payments on March 31, but becomes liable for estimated tax at some point after March 31, the taxpayer must make estimated tax payments as follows:\n\n(1) if the taxpayer becomes required to pay estimated tax after March 31 and before June 1, fifty percent of the required annual payment must be paid on or before June 15, twenty-five percent on September 15 and twenty-five percent on or before January 15 of the following taxable year;\n\n(2) if the taxpayer becomes required to pay estimated tax after May 31, but before September 1, the taxpayer must pay seventy-five percent of the required annual payment on or before September 15 and twenty-five percent on or before January 15 of the following taxable year; and\n\n(3) if the taxpayer becomes required to pay estimated tax after August 31, the taxpayer must pay one hundred percent of the required annual payment on or before January 15 of the following taxable year.\n\nD.

If a joint return is filed, a rancher or farmer must consider the rancher's or farmer's spouse's gross income in determining whether at least two-thirds of gross income is from ranching or farming.\n\nF. For the purposes of this section, the amount of tax deducted and withheld with respect to a taxpayer under the Withholding Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 3 NMSA 1978] or the Oil and Gas Proceeds and Pass-Through Entity Withholding Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 3A NMSA 1978] shall be deemed a payment of estimated tax. An equal part of the amount of withheld tax shall be deemed paid on each due date for the applicable taxable year unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld. In that case, the amounts withheld shall be deemed payments of estimated tax on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld. The taxpayer may apply the provisions of this subsection separately to wage withholding and any other amounts withheld under the Withholding Tax Act or the Oil and Gas Proceeds and Pass-Through Entity Withholding Tax Act. Amounts of tax paid by taxpayers pursuant to Section 7-3A-3 NMSA 1978 shall not be deemed a payment of estimated tax.\n\nG.

No penalty shall be imposed under Subsection G of this section for any taxable year if:\n\n(1) the difference between the following is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000):\n\n(a) the tax shown on the return for the taxable year or, when no return is filed, the tax for the taxable year; and\n\n(b) any amount withheld under the provisions of the Withholding Tax Act or the Oil and Gas Proceeds and Pass-Through Entity Withholding Tax Act for that taxpayer for that taxable year;\n\n(2) the taxpayer's preceding taxable year was a taxable year of twelve months, the taxpayer did not have a tax liability for the preceding taxable year and the taxpayer was a resident of New Mexico for the entire taxable year;\n\n(3) through either withholding or estimated tax payments, the taxpayer paid the required annual payment as defined in Subsection B of this section; or\n\n(4) the secretary determines that the underpayment was not due to fraud, negligence or disregard of rules and regulations.\n\nI. If on or before January 31 of the following taxable year the taxpayer files a return for the taxable year and pays in full the amount computed on the return as payable, then a penalty under Subsection G of this section shall not be imposed on an underpayment of the fourth required installment for the taxable year.\n\nJ. This section applies to taxable years of less than twelve months and to taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year other than a calendar year in the manner determined by regulation or instruction of the secretary.\n\nK.

Except as otherwise provided in Subsection B of this section, any resident who files an individual New Mexico income tax return and who is not a dependent of another individual may claim a tax rebate for a portion of state and local taxes to which the resident has been subject during the taxable year for which the return is filed. The tax rebate may be claimed even though the resident has no income taxable under the Income Tax Act. Married individuals who file separate returns for a taxable year in which they could have filed a joint return may each claim only one-half of the tax rebate that would have been allowed on a joint return.\n\nB. No claim for the tax rebate provided in this section shall be filed by a resident who was an inmate of a public institution for more than six months during the taxable year for which the tax rebate could be claimed or who was not physically present in New Mexico for at least six months during the taxable year for which the tax rebate could be claimed.\n\nC. For the purposes of this section, the total number of exemptions for which a tax rebate may be claimed or allowed is determined by adding the number of federal exemptions allowable for federal income tax purposes for each individual included in the return who is domiciled in New Mexico plus two additional exemptions for each individual domiciled in New Mexico included in the return who is sixty-five years of age or older plus one additional exemption for each individual domiciled in New Mexico included in the return who, for federal income tax purposes, is blind plus one exemption for each minor child or stepchild of the resident who would be a dependent for federal income tax purposes if the public assistance contributing to the support of the child or stepchild was considered to have been contributed by the resident.\n\nD.

If a taxpayer's modified gross income is zero, the taxpayer may claim a credit in the amount shown in the first row of the table appropriate for the taxpayer's number of exemptions as adjusted by the provisions of Subsection F of this section.\n\nF. For the 2022 taxable year and each subsequent taxable year, the amount of rebate shown in the table in Subsection D of this section shall be adjusted to account for inflation. The department shall make the adjustment by multiplying each amount of rebate by a fraction, the numerator of which is the consumer price index ending during the prior taxable year and the denominator of which is the consumer price index ending in tax year 2021. The result of the multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest one dollar ($1.00), except that if the result would be an amount less than the corresponding amount for the preceding taxable year, then no adjustment shall be made.\n\nG. The tax rebates provided for in this section may be deducted from the taxpayer's New Mexico income tax liability for the taxable year. If the tax rebates exceed the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer.\n\nH.

The energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue rules governing the procedure for administering the provisions of this subsection. If the certification level for the sustainable residential building is awarded on or after January 1, 2007, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility to a building owner who is:\n\n(1) the owner of the sustainable residential building at the time the certification level for the building is awarded; or\n\n(2) the subsequent purchaser of a sustainable residential building with respect to which no tax credit has been previously claimed.\n\nG. The energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility only if the total amount of sustainable building tax credits represented by certificates of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to this section and pursuant to the Corporate Income and Franchise Tax Act shall not exceed in any calendar year an aggregate amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000) with respect to sustainable commercial buildings and an aggregate amount of four million dollars ($4,000,000) with respect to sustainable residential buildings; provided that no more than one million two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($1,250,000) of the aggregate amount with respect to sustainable residential buildings shall be for manufactured housing. If for any taxable year the energy, minerals and natural resources department determines that the applications for sustainable building tax credits with respect to sustainable residential buildings for that taxable year exceed the aggregate limit set in this section, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue certificates of eligibility under the aggregate annual limit for sustainable commercial buildings to owners of sustainable residential buildings that meet the requirements of the energy, minerals and natural resources department and of this section; provided that applications for sustainable building credits for other sustainable commercial buildings total less than the full amount allocated for tax credits for sustainable commercial buildings.\n\nH. Installation of a solar thermal system or a photovoltaic system eligible for the solar market development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.14 NMSA 1978 may not be used as a component of qualification for the rating system certification level used in determining eligibility for the sustainable building tax credit, unless a solar market development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.14 NMSA 1978 has not been claimed with respect to that system and the building owner and the taxpayer claiming the sustainable building tax credit certify that such a tax credit will not be claimed with respect to that system.\n\nI.

If the requirements of this section have been complied with, the department shall issue to the building owner a document granting a sustainable building tax credit. The document shall be numbered for identification and declare its date of issuance and the amount of the tax credit allowed pursuant to this section. The document may be submitted by the building owner with that taxpayer's income tax return, if applicable, or may be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred to another taxpayer. The parties to such a transaction shall notify the department of the sale, exchange or transfer within ten days of the sale, exchange or transfer.\n\nK. If the total approved amount of all sustainable building tax credits for a taxpayer in a taxable year represented by the documents issued pursuant to Subsection J of this section is:\n\n(1) less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), a maximum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) shall be applied against the taxpayer's income tax liability for the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the next three subsequent taxable years as needed depending on the amount of credit; or\n\n(2) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more, increments of twenty-five percent of the total credit amount in each of the four taxable years, including the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the three subsequent taxable years, shall be applied against the taxpayer's income tax liability.\n\nL. If the sum of all sustainable building tax credits that can be applied to a taxable year for a taxpayer, calculated according to Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection K of this section, exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability for that taxable year, the excess may be carried forward for a period of up to seven years.\n\nM. A taxpayer who otherwise qualifies and claims a sustainable building tax credit with respect to a sustainable building owned by a partnership or other business association of which the taxpayer is a member may claim a credit only in proportion to that taxpayer's interest in the partnership or association. The total credit claimed in the aggregate by all members of the partnership or association with respect to the sustainable building shall not exceed the amount of the credit that could have been claimed by a sole owner of the property.\n\nN. A husband and wife who file separate returns for a taxable year in which they could have filed a joint return may each claim only one-half of the sustainable building tax credit that would have been allowed on a joint return.\n\nO. The department shall compile an annual report on the sustainable building tax credit created pursuant to this section that shall include the number of taxpayers approved by the department to receive the tax credit, the aggregate amount of tax credits approved and any other information necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the tax credit.

If the requirements of this section have been complied with, the department shall issue to the building owner a document granting a 2015 sustainable building tax credit. The document shall be numbered for identification and declare its date of issuance and the amount of the tax credit allowed pursuant to this section. The document may be submitted by the building owner with that taxpayer's income tax return, if applicable, or may be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred to another taxpayer. The parties to such a transaction shall notify the department of the sale, exchange or transfer within ten days of the sale, exchange or transfer.\n\nL. If the approved amount of a 2015 sustainable building tax credit for a taxpayer in a taxable year represented by a document issued pursuant to Subsection K of this section is:\n\n(1) less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), a maximum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) shall be applied against the taxpayer's income tax liability for the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the next three subsequent taxable years as needed depending on the amount of credit; or\n\n(2) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more, increments of twenty-five percent of the total credit amount in each of the four taxable years, including the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the three subsequent taxable years, shall be applied against the taxpayer's income tax liability.\n\nM. If the sum of all 2015 sustainable building tax credits that can be applied to a taxable year for a taxpayer, calculated according to Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection L of this section, exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability for that taxable year, the excess may be carried forward for a period of up to seven years.\n\nN. A taxpayer who otherwise qualifies and claims a 2015 sustainable building tax credit with respect to a sustainable building owned by a partnership or other business association of which the taxpayer is a member may claim a credit only in proportion to that taxpayer's interest in the partnership or association. The total credit claimed in the aggregate by all members of the partnership or association with respect to the sustainable building shall not exceed the amount of the credit that could have been claimed by a sole owner of the property.\n\nO. Married individuals who file separate returns for a taxable year in which they could have filed a joint return may each claim only one-half of the 2015 sustainable building tax credit that would have been allowed on a joint return.\n\nP.

A person who is a building owner may apply for a certificate of eligibility for the 2021 sustainable building tax credit from the energy, minerals and natural resources department after the construction, installation or renovation of the sustainable building or installation of energy-conserving products in an existing building is complete. Applications shall be considered in the order received. If the energy, minerals and natural resources department determines that the building owner meets the requirements of this subsection and that the building with respect to which the application is made meets the requirements of this section for a 2021 sustainable building tax credit, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility to the building owner, subject to the limitations in Subsection D of this section. The certificate shall include the rating system certification level awarded to the building, the amount of qualified occupied square footage in the building, a calculation of the maximum amount of 2021 sustainable building tax credit for which the building owner would be eligible, the identification number, date of issuance and the first taxable year that the credit shall be claimed. The energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue rules governing the procedure for administering the provisions of this subsection. If the certification level for the sustainable residential building is awarded on or after January 1, 2022, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility to a building owner who is:\n\n(1) the owner of the sustainable residential building at the time the certification level for the building is awarded; or\n\n(2) the subsequent purchaser of a sustainable residential building with respect to which no tax credit has been previously claimed.\n\nD. Except as provided in Subsection E of this section, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility only if the total amount of 2021 sustainable building tax credits represented by certificates of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to this section and pursuant to the Corporate Income and Franchise Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 2A NMSA 1978] shall not exceed in any calendar year an aggregate amount of:\n\n(1) one million dollars ($1,000,000) with respect to the construction of new sustainable commercial buildings;\n\n(2) two million dollars ($2,000,000) with respect to the construction of new sustainable residential buildings that are not manufactured housing;\n\n(3) two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) with respect to the construction of new sustainable residential buildings that are manufactured housing;\n\n(4) one million dollars ($1,000,000) with respect to the renovation of large commercial buildings; and\n\n(5) two million nine hundred thousand dollars ($2,900,000) with respect to the installation of energy-conserving products in existing commercial buildings pursuant to Paragraph (3) of Subsection B of this section and existing residential buildings pursuant to Paragraph (5) of Subsection B of this section.\n\nE.

To claim the 2021 sustainable building tax credit, the building owner shall provide to the taxation and revenue department a certificate of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to the requirements of Subsection C of this section and any other information the taxation and revenue department may require.\n\nH. If the approved amount of a 2021 sustainable building tax credit for a taxpayer in a taxable year represented by a document issued pursuant to Subsection C of this section is:\n\n(1) less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), a maximum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) shall be applied against the taxpayer's income tax liability for the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the next three subsequent taxable years as needed depending on the amount of credit; or\n\n(2) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more, increments of twenty-five percent of the total credit amount in each of the four taxable years, including the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the three subsequent taxable years, shall be applied against the taxpayer's income tax liability.\n\nI. If the sum of all 2021 sustainable building tax credits that can be applied to a taxable year for a taxpayer, calculated according to Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection H of this section, exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability for that taxable year, the excess may be carried forward for a period of up to seven years; provided that if the taxpayer is a low-income taxpayer, the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer.\n\nJ. A taxpayer who otherwise qualifies and claims a 2021 sustainable building tax credit with respect to a sustainable building owned by a partnership or other business association of which the taxpayer is a member may claim a credit only in proportion to that taxpayer's interest in the partnership or association. The total credit claimed in the aggregate by all members of the partnership or association with respect to the sustainable building shall not exceed the amount of the credit that could have been claimed by a sole owner of the property.\n\nK. Married individuals who file separate returns for a taxable year in which they could have filed a joint return may each claim only one-half of the 2021 sustainable building tax credit that would have been allowed on a joint return.\n\nL. If the requirements of this section have been complied with, the department shall issue to the building owner a document granting a 2021 sustainable building tax credit. The document shall be numbered for identification and declare its date of issuance and the amount of the tax credit allowed pursuant to this section. The document may be submitted by the building owner with that taxpayer's income tax return, if applicable, or may be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred to another taxpayer. The parties to such a transaction shall notify the department of the sale, exchange or transfer within ten days of the sale, exchange or transfer.\n\nM. The department and the energy, minerals and natural resources department shall compile an annual report on the 2021 sustainable building tax credit created pursuant to this section that shall include the number of taxpayers approved to receive the tax credit, the aggregate amount of tax credits approved and any other information necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the tax credit.

      "text": "A. The tax credit provided by this section may be referred to as the \"advanced energy equipment income tax credit\". A taxpayer who is not a dependent of another individual, who makes qualified expenditures for a qualified manufacturing facility located in New Mexico and who files an individual New Mexico income tax return for a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2025, and prior to January 1, 2033, may claim the tax credit in the amount provided in Subsection B of this section.\n\nB. The amount of the tax credit shall be in an amount equal to the lesser of twenty percent of the amount of the qualified expenditures made by the taxpayer for a qualified manufacturing facility or twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000).\n\nC. Prior to incurring a qualified expenditure, a taxpayer shall apply for preliminary certification of eligibility for the tax credit from the energy, minerals and natural resources department on forms and in the manner prescribed by that department. Such preliminary certification shall be made in consultation with the economic development department and shall be limited to confirming that the qualified expenditures proposed to be made by the taxpayer will in whole or in part be used to produce advanced energy products and providing an estimate of the amount of tax credit for which the taxpayer may be eligible. Only one certificate of eligibility shall be issued for all activities performed at a qualified manufacturing facility, regardless of ownership of the facility.\n\nD. Within twelve months of commencement of production of any advanced energy product, the taxpayer shall seek final certification from the energy, minerals and natural resources department. The total annual aggregate amount of advanced energy equipment income tax credits and advanced energy equipment corporate income tax credits that may be certified in a calendar year shall not exceed twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000). An application for final certification shall include information required by the energy, minerals and natural resources department to determine eligibility for the tax credit, including information substantiating qualified expenditures. If, after consultation with the economic development department, the energy, minerals and natural resources department determines that the taxpayer meets the requirements of this section, the energy, minerals and natural resources department shall issue a dated certificate of eligibility to the taxpayer providing the amount of tax credit for which the taxpayer is eligible and the taxable years in which the credit may be claimed. The energy, minerals and natural resources department shall provide the department with the certificates of eligibility issued pursuant to this subsection in an electronic format at regularly agreed-upon intervals. A certificate of eligibility for the tax credit may be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred to another taxpayer in increments of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000); provided that if the total amount certified is less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), the certificate of the entire amount of the credit may be transferred. The parties to such a transaction shall notify the department of the sale, exchange or transfer within ten days of the sale, exchange or transfer in an electronic format prescribed by the department.\n\nE. A taxpayer allowed to claim the tax credit shall claim the credit in a manner required by the department. The tax credit shall be claimed within one year of receiving final certification from the energy, minerals and natural resources department. The taxpayer shall claim the amount certified and approved against the taxpayer's income tax liabilities. Any amount of credit that exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liabilities may be carried forward for five consecutive taxable years. A taxpayer who claims the tax credit shall report to the department and the energy, minerals and natural resources department on the continued operations of the qualified manufacturing facility.\n\nF. Married individuals filing separate returns for a taxable year for which they could have filed a joint return may each claim only one-half of the tax credit that would have been claimed on a joint return.\n\nG. A taxpayer may be allocated the right to claim the tax credit in a proportion to the taxpayer's ownership interest if the taxpayer owns an interest in a business entity that is taxed for federal income tax purposes as a partnership or limited liability company and that business entity has met all of the requirements to be eligible for the credit. The total credit claimed by all members of the partnership or limited liability company shall not exceed the allowable credit pursuant to this section.\n\nH. If the taxpayer or a successor in the business of the taxpayer ceases operations at the qualifying manufacturing facility or ceases to produce advanced energy products for at least one hundred eighty days within a two-year period after the taxpayer has claimed the tax credit, any amount of credit that received final certification with respect to that facility that is not claimed against a taxpayer's tax liability shall be extinguished, and within thirty days after the one hundred eightieth day of cessation of operations, the taxpayer who received final certification pursuant to Subsection D of this section shall pay to the department the tax liability against which the certified credit was claimed. For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer shall not be deemed to have ceased operations during reasonable periods for maintenance or retooling, for the repair or replacement of facilities damaged or destroyed or during labor disputes.\n\nI.
