For the purposes of this section:\n\n(1) \"advance payment\" means the payment required to be made by this section in addition to any oil and gas emergency school tax, penalty or interest due; and\n\n(2) \"average tax\" means the aggregate amount of tax, net of any refunds or credits, paid by a person during the twelve-month period ending March 31, pursuant to the Oil and Gas Emergency School Tax Act divided by the number of months during that period for which the person made payment.\n\nC. Each year, prior to July 1, each person required to pay tax pursuant to the Oil and Gas Emergency School Tax Act shall compute the average tax for the period ending March 31 of that year. The average tax calculated for a year shall be used during the twelve-month period beginning with July of that year and ending with June of the following year as the basis for making the advance payments required by Subsection D of this section.\n\nD. Every month, beginning with July 1991, every person required to pay tax in a month pursuant to the Oil and Gas Emergency School Tax Act shall pay, in addition to any amount of tax, interest or penalty due, an advance payment in an amount equal to the applicable average tax, except:\n\n(1) if the person is making a final return under the Oil and Gas Emergency School Tax Act, no advance payment pursuant to this subsection is due for that return; and\n\n(2) as provided in Subsection F of this section.\n\nE. Every month, beginning with tax payments in August 1991, every person required to pay tax pursuant to the Oil and Gas Emergency School Tax Act may claim a credit equal to the amount of advance payment made in the previous month, except as provided in Subsection F of this section.\n\nF. If, in any month, a person is not required to pay tax pursuant to the Oil and Gas Emergency School Tax Act, that person is not required to pay the advance payment and may not claim a credit pursuant to Subsection E of this section provided that, in any succeeding month when the person has liability under the Oil and Gas Emergency School Tax Act, the person may claim a credit for any advance payment made and not credited.\n\nG. In the event that the date by which a person is required to pay the tax pursuant to the Oil and Gas Emergency School Tax Act is accelerated to a date earlier than the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production, the advance payment provision contained in this section is null and void and any money held as advance payments shall be credited to the taxpayers' accounts.\n\nHistory:Laws 1991, ch. 9, § 38.",

      "text": "A. A person who is liable for the payment of the oil and gas emergency school tax imposed on products severed from Jicarilla Apache tribal land or imposed on the privilege of severing products from Jicarilla Apache tribal land shall be entitled to a credit to be computed pursuant to this section and to be deducted from the payment of those taxes with respect to products from qualifying wells. The credit provided by this section may be referred to as the \"Jicarilla Apache tribal capital improvements tax credit\".\n\nB. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"Jicarilla Apache tribal land\" means land within the state of New Mexico that on March 1, 2002 was within the exterior boundaries of a Jicarilla Apache reservation or was held in trust by the United States for the Jicarilla Apache Nation;\n\n(2) \"product\" means oil, natural gas or liquid hydrocarbon, individually or in combination, or carbon dioxide;\n\n(3) \"qualifying well\" means a well on Jicarilla Apache tribal land; and\n\n(4) \"Jicarilla Apache tribal capital improvements tax\" means a tax imposed after the effective date of this section by the Jicarilla Apache Nation that is exclusively dedicated to fund capital improvement projects on Jicarilla Apache tribal land and that is not available to finance the construction of buildings used for commercial activity.\n\nC. The Jicarilla Apache tribal capital improvements tax credit shall be determined separately for each calendar month and shall be equal to the lesser of:\n\n(1) the amount of the Jicarilla Apache tribal capital improvements tax imposed by the Jicarilla Apache Nation upon the products severed from qualifying wells or upon the privilege of severing products from qualifying wells; or\n\n(2) seven-tenths of one percent of the taxable value of the products severed from qualifying wells as determined by applicable state law.\n\nD. A credit pursuant to this section shall be allowed by the taxation and revenue department only if the Jicarilla Apache Nation has entered into a cooperative agreement with the secretary of taxation and revenue for the exchange of information necessary for the administration of the Jicarilla Apache tribal capital improvements tax credit.\n\nE. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the amount of credit taken and allowed shall be applied against the amount of the oil and gas emergency school tax due with respect to the products or severance of products taxed.\n\nF. The credit provided by this section shall be in addition to any credit claimed by the taxpayer or allowed by the taxation and revenue department pursuant to Section 7-29C-1 NMSA 1978 with respect to the same products or the severance of the same products. A Jicarilla Apache tribal capital improvements tax that qualifies for the credit provided by this section shall constitute an increase in tribal taxes for purposes of Subsection F of Section 7-29C-1 NMSA 1978 only to the extent that it exceeds the amount identified in Paragraph (2) of Subsection C of this section.\n\nG. The taxation and revenue department shall administer and interpret the provisions of this section in accordance with the provisions of the Tax Administration Act [Chapter 7, Article 1 NMSA 1978].\n\nH. The burden of showing entitlement to a credit authorized by this section is on the taxpayer claiming it, and the taxpayer shall furnish to the appropriate tax collecting agency, in a manner determined by the taxation and revenue department, proof of payment of the Jicarilla Apache tribal capital improvements tax on which the credit is based.\n\nHistory:Laws 2002, ch. 15, § 1.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2002, ch. 15, § 2 made Laws 2002, ch. 15, § 1 effective January 1, 2003.",
