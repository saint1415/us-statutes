Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 617 F.2d 537 (10th Cir. 1980),aff'd, 455 U.S. 130, 102 S. Ct. 894, 71 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1982).\n\nNon-Indian producers operating on reservations.— Oil and gas taxes imposed by the state against a non-Indian producer whose operations are located on an Indian reservation do not constitute an impermissible burden on interstate commerce, were not preempted by federal laws promoting tribal self-sufficiency, and may be imposed on the same on-reservation production of oil and gas by non-Indian lessees as is subject to the tribe's own severance tax.Cotton Petroleum v. State, 1987-NMCA-121, 106 N.M. 517, 745 P.2d 1170, cert. quashed, 106 N.M. 511, 745 P.2d 1159,aff'd, 490 U.S. 163, 109 S. Ct. 1698, 104 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1989).\n\nTax liability of interest owners.— Although, pursuant to Subsection C, each interest owner is liable for its proportionate share of the calculated tax, the law does not mandate or even contemplate the determination of different taxable values for each of the various interest owners based on proceeds received downstream from the wellhead. The law is satisfied so long as (1) carbon dioxide production is accurately measured and valued as a whole at the wellhead, (2) the appropriate tax rate is applied to that production to calculate the total tax owed, and (3) the total tax is allocated to the various interest owners in proportion to their fractional interest in that production. Any readjustment in the allocation of the tax burden among working interest owners and royalty interest owners is left to private contract.Feerer v. Amoco Prod. Co., 242 F.3d 1259 (10th Cir. 2001).\n\nTaxable value of carbon dioxide.— The calculation of severance taxes under New Mexico law, Subsection A(6) (now Subsection A(10)), is based on a single valuation of a total quantity of carbon dioxide extracted at the wellhead during a given time period.Feerer v. Amoco Prod. Co., 242 F.3d 1259 (10th Cir. 2001).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Nonneutral Features of Energy Taxation,\" see 20 Nat.

For the purposes of this section:\n\n(1) \"advance payment\" means the payment required to be made by this section in addition to any oil and gas severance tax, penalty or interest due; and\n\n(2) \"average tax\" means the aggregate amount of tax, net of any refunds or credits, paid by a person during the twelve-month period ending March 31 pursuant to the Oil and Gas Severance Tax Act divided by the number of months during that period for which the person made payment.\n\nC. Each year, prior to July 1, each person required to pay tax pursuant to the Oil and Gas Severance Tax Act shall compute the average tax for the period ending March 31 of that year. The average tax calculated for a year shall be used during the twelve-month period beginning with July of that year and ending with June of the following year as the basis for making the advance payments required by Subsection D of this section.\n\nD. Every month, beginning with July 1991, every person required to pay tax in a month pursuant to the Oil and Gas Severance Tax Act shall pay, in addition to any amount of tax, interest or penalty due, an advance payment in an amount equal to the applicable average tax, except:\n\n(1) if the person is making a final return under the Oil and Gas Severance Tax Act, no advance payment pursuant to this subsection is due for that return; and\n\n(2) as provided in Subsection F of this section.\n\nE. Every month, beginning with tax payments due in August 1991, every person required to pay tax pursuant to the Oil and Gas Severance Tax Act may claim a credit equal to the amount of advance payment made in the previous month, except as provided in Subsection F of this section.\n\nF. If, in any month, a person is not required to pay tax pursuant to the Oil and Gas Severance Tax Act, that person is not required to pay the advance payment and may not claim a credit pursuant to Subsection E of this section provided that, in any succeeding month when the person has liability under the Oil and Gas Severance Tax Act, the person may claim a credit for any advance payment made and not credited.\n\nG.
