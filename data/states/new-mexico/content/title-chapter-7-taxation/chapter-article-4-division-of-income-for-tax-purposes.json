      "text": "As used in the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act:\n\nA. \"business income\" means income arising from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business and income from the disposition or liquidation of a business or segment of a business. \"Business income\" includes income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, management or disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer's regular trade or business operations;\n\nB. \"commercial domicile\" means the principal place from which the trade or business of the taxpayer is directed or managed;\n\nC. \"compensation\" means wages, salaries, commissions and any other form of remuneration paid to employees for personal services;\n\nD. \"department\" means the taxation and revenue department, the secretary of taxation and revenue or any employee of the department exercising authority lawfully delegated to that employee by the secretary;\n\nE. \"nonbusiness income\" means all income other than business income;\n\nF. \"sales\" means all gross receipts of the taxpayer not allocated under Sections 7-4-5 through 7-4-9 NMSA 1978 of the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act;\n\nG. \"secretary\" means the secretary of taxation and revenue or a division director delegated by the secretary; and\n\nH. \"state\" means any state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, and any foreign country or political subdivision thereof.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-15A-17, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 203, § 2; 1986, ch. 20, § 55; 1999, ch. 47, § 7.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, in Subsection A inserted \"income from the disposition or liquidation of a business or segment of a business. 'Business income\"' and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\n\"Transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business\"means business deals and the performance of a specific function in the normal, typical, customary or accustomed policy or procedure of the taxpayer's trade or business.Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70;Tipperary Corp. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078.\n\nII. CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES.\n\nFairly apportioned tax constitutional.— When the apportioned tax is only on that portion of taxpayer's income that fairly represents the extent of taxpayer's business activities in this state, tax is not violative of the due process or commerce clauses of the federal constitution.Tipperary Corp. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078.\n\nTaxation of dividends from foreign subsidiary.— The right of a state to tax dividends from foreign subsidiaries must be considered in relation to the due process requirements that the income attributed to a state for tax purposes be rationally related to values connected with the taxing state.F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 458 U.S. 354, 102 S. Ct. 3128, 73 L. Ed. 2d 819,reh'g denied, 459 U.S. 961, 103 S. Ct. 274, 74 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1982).\n\nTaxation of income from foreign tax credit.— A foreign tax credit arising from the taxation by foreign nations of a corporation's foreign subsidiaries that had no unitary business relationship with the state, efforts by the state to tax this income \"deemed received\" - with respect to which the state contributed nothing - were held to contravene the due process clause.F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 458 U.S. 354, 102 S. Ct. 3128, 73 L. Ed. 2d 819,reh'g denied, 459 U.S. 961, 103 S. Ct. 274, 74 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1982).\n\nIII. BUSINESS INCOME.\n\nAll income of business organization is not \"business income\";business income must arise from the regular course of business.Tipperary Corp. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078.\n\nBusiness income must arise from such transactions.— To constitute business income the income must arise from transactions and activity in the regular course of a trade or business.McVean & Barlow, Inc. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-128, 88 N.M. 521, 543 P.2d 489, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71.\n\nFactors pertinent in determining if income is business income.— Pertinent in determining whether income arises from transactions in the regular course of business is the nature of the particular transaction and former practices of the business entity; also pertinent is how the income is used.Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70;Tipperary Corp. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078.\n\nUse of investment income.— The use to which a multistate corporation put its investment income was determinative of whether it was business income.Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.\n\nDetermination of business income.— Use to which income is put determines whether it is business income.Tipperary Corp. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078.\n\nShort-term investment income held business income.— Since a multistate corporation derived interest income from capital earned in its business, rather than having a large cash balance in the bank, purchasing short-term investments and highly liquid assets from which the interest was derived, money from which short-term investments was needed for future business activity, such investment was a specific function of the corporation, and that it was usual and customary in the corporation's business to follow this practice, whenever there was enough money or business income that was not immediately needed in the business, and therefore the investment income was business income.Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.\n\nRent of part of office space held business income.— Although a multistate corporate taxpayer claimed that income derived from rent of 5% of its total office space was not \"business income\" because it was not in the business of renting real estate, the most reasonable inference to be drawn from the record is that rental of available office space was a customary procedure, done in the regular course of the taxpayer's business, and since there was no evidence in the record to contradict this inference, the rental income was held to be \"business income.\"Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.\n\nIncome from sale of telephone poles by paper company held business income.— Since a multistate corporation manufactured wood and paper products from timber on land owned or leased by it, and sold some of its logs to telephone utilities for use as telephone poles and the sale of logs was a normal, customary procedure in the taxpayer's business for the year in question and had been for several years, the income arising therefrom was income arising from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business.Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.\n\nWhen coal lease sale in regular course of business.— Since taxpayer is in the business of exploration and development of oil, gas and minerals, the sale of the coal leases is in the regular course of this business.Tipperary Corp. v. New Mexico Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078.\n\nCoal lease sale taxable.— Since taxpayer's business is unitary and since a gain from the sale of its coal leases is business income under Subsection A of this section, this state can tax a percentage of this income.Tipperary Corp. v. New Mexico Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078.\n\nIncome from coal dragline leases held business income.— Oil company's income from its dragline leases was business income because the leases generated substantial capital for the company's general business purposes, and the leases were ongoing, recurring transactions constituting a regular or customary portion of company's overall business, which contributed to the company's economic enterprise as a whole.Kewanee Indus., Inc. v. Reese, 1993-NMSC-006, 114 N.M. 784, 845 P.2d 1238.\n\nIncome from liquidation of part of business held not business income.— Since the taxpayer was not in the business of buying and selling pipeline equipment and the transaction in question was a partial liquidation of taxpayer's business and a total cessation and liquidation of one facet of the business, the sale of equipment did not constitute an integral part of the regular trade or business operations of taxpayer and the proceeds thereof were not business income.McVean & Barlow, Inc. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-128, 88 N.M. 521, 543 P.2d 489, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71.\n\nIV. UNITARY BUSINESS PRINCIPLE.\n\nUnderlying unitary business required.— The linchpin of apportionability for state income taxation of an interstate enterprise is the unitary-business principle.F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 458 U.S. 354, 102 S. Ct. 3128, 73 L. Ed. 2d 819,reh'g denied, 459 U.S. 961, 103 S. Ct. 274, 74 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1982).\n\nDerivation of dividend income from subsidiaries.— The potential to operate a company as part of a unitary business is not dispositive when, looking at the underlying economic realities of a unitary business, the dividend income from subsidiaries in fact is derived from unrelated business activity which constitutes a discrete business enterprise.F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 458 U.S. 354, 102 S. Ct. 3128, 73 L. Ed. 2d 819,reh'g denied, 459 U.S. 961, 103 S. Ct. 274, 74 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1982).\n\nExistence of underlying unitary business.— When, except for the type of occasional oversight - with respect to capital structure, major debt, and dividends - that any parent gives to an investment in a subsidiary, there is little or no integration of business activities or centralization of management of the parent company and its foreign subsidiaries, there is no underlying unitary business that would justify the state's taxing of dividends from the foreign subsidiaries.F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 458 U.S. 354, 102 S. Ct. 3128, 73 L. Ed. 2d 819,reh'g denied, 459 U.S. 961, 103 S. Ct. 274, 74 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1982).\n\nMultistate business may be unitary or independent.— A multistate business is a \"unitary business\" for income tax purposes when operations conducted in one state benefit and are in turn benefited by operations in another state, and if its various parts are interdependent and of mutual benefit so as to form one integral business rather than several business entities, it is unitary. On the other hand, if a multistate business enterprise is conducted in a way that one, some or all of the business operations outside New Mexico are independent of and do not contribute to the business operations within this state, the factors attributable to the outside activity may be excluded.Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.\n\nTaxpayer must show business independent to exclude income.— Where a multistate corporation challenged commissioner's allocation of certain interest, rent and gains to business income, but failed to produce evidence that its business activity outside of New Mexico was dependent or independent of its instate operations, or that the interest, rent and gains income was not an integral part of its business carried on in this state, no question was raised whether any of its income was nonbusiness income because there was no evidence that its activities were not part of a unitary business, and therefore the assessed additional corporate income tax was affirmed.Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.\n\nAm.

Except as provided in Subsections B and C of this section, all business income shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the property factor plus the payroll factor plus the sales factor and the denominator of which is three.\n\nB. If eighty percent or more of the New Mexico numerators of the property and payroll factors for a filing group, or for a taxpayer that is not a member of a filing group, are employed in manufacturing or operating a computer processing facility, the filing group or the taxpayer may elect to have business income apportioned to this state by multiplying the income by the sales factor for the taxable year.\n\nC. If a filing group, or a taxpayer that is not a member of a filing group, has a headquarters operation in New Mexico, the filing group or the taxpayer may elect to have business income apportioned to this state by multiplying the income by the sales factor for the taxable year.\n\nD. To elect the method of apportionment provided by Subsection B or C of this section, the taxpayer shall notify the department of the election, in writing, no later than the date on which the taxpayer files the return for the first taxable year to which the election will apply. The election shall apply as follows:\n\n(1) if the election is made for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2020, to the taxable year in which the election is made and to each taxable year thereafter for three years, or until the taxable year ending prior to January 1, 2020, whichever is earlier;\n\n(2) if the election is made for a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2020, to the taxable year in which the election is made and to each taxable year thereafter until the taxpayer notifies the department, in writing, that the election is terminated, except that the taxpayer shall not terminate the election until the method of apportioning business income provided by Subsection B or C of this section has been used by the taxpayer for at least three consecutive taxable years, including a total of at least thirty-six calendar months; and\n\n(3) if the election is made by a qualifying filing group, the election shall apply to the members of the filing group properly included pursuant to Section 7-2A-8.3 NMSA 1978.\n\nE. For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) \"filing group\" means \"filing group\" as that term is defined in the Corporate Income and Franchise Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 2A NMSA 1978];\n\n(2) \"headquarters operation\" means:\n\n(a) the center of operations of a business: 1) where corporate staff employees are physically employed; 2) where the centralized functions are primarily performed, including administrative, planning, managerial, human resources, purchasing, information technology and accounting, but not including operating a call center;

or\n\n(e) processing or preparation of meals for immediate consumption; and\n\n(4) \"operating a computer processing facility\" means managing the necessary and ancillary activities for the operation of a facility primarily used to process data or information, but does not include managing the operation of facilities that are predominantly used to support sales of tangible property or the provision of banking, financial or professional services.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 7-4-10, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 153, § 1;

and in Subsection E, Subparagraph E(3)(c), after \"provided that\", deleted \"for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2024\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2024, ch. 67, § 42 provided that the provisions of Laws 2024, ch. 67, §§ 7, 9 and 23 through 31 apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2024.\n\nThe 2020 amendment,effective May 20, 2020, revised the definition of \"manufacturing\" as used in the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act; in Subsection B, after \"manufacturing\", added \"or operating a computer processing facility\"; and in Subsection E, Paragraph E(3), in the introductory clause, after \"means\", deleted \"operating a computer processing facility or\", and in Subparagraph E(3)(c), deleted \"electric\", and after \"power generation\", added \"provided that for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2024, 'manufacturing' includes electricity generation at a facility that does not require location approval and a certificate of convenience and necessity prior to commencing construction or operation of the facility pursuant to the Public Utility Act\".\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective January 1, 2020, completely rewrote provisions related to apportioning business income to this state; deleted former Subsections B through D and added new Subsections B through D; and in Subsection E, added new Paragraph E(1) and redesignated former Paragraphs E(1) and E(2) as Paragraphs E(2) and E(3), in Paragraph E(3), in the introductory clause, after \"means\", added \"operating a computer processing facility or\", in Subparagraph E(3)(c), after the subparagraph designation, added \"electric\", and after \"generation;\", deleted \"except for electricity generation at a facility other than one for which both location approval and a certificate of convenience and necessity are required prior to commencing construction or operation of the facility, pursuant to the Public Utility Act; or\", and added new Subparagraph E(3)(e) and Paragraph E(4).\n\nThe 2015 (1st S.S.) amendment,effective September 6, 2015, provided for taxpayers whose principal business activity in New Mexico is a headquarters operation to elect to have business income apportioned to this state, and added the definition for \"headquarters operation\";

deleted former Subsection B, which provided for the apportionment of business income by manufacturers, the procedure for electing the method of apportionment, and limitations on the election of a method of apportionment;

added current Subsection A; redesignated former Subsection A as Subsection B; inserted \"For taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2011\" to Subsection B; and deleted former Subsection B concerning apportion of business income to the state.\n\nConstitutionality of apportionment.— The United States Constitution does not impose any single method of apportionment on a multistate or multinational taxpayer's income.NCR Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-060, 115 N.M. 612, 856 P.2d 982, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 677, 857 P.2d 788, cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1245, 114 S. Ct. 2763, 129 L. Ed. 2d 877 (1994).\n\nConstitutionality of formula applied to taxation of dividends received from foreign subsidiaries.— Taxation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries under the separate corporate entity method violates the commerce clause of the United States Constitution, and application of theDetroitformula is an insufficient remedy.Conoco, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1997-NMSC-005, 122 N.M. 736, 931 P.2d 730, cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1112, 117 S. Ct. 2497, 138 L. Ed. 2d 1003 (1997),rev'g1997-NMCA-004, 122 N.M. 745, 931 P.2d 739.\n\nStandard for challenge of apportionment.— A taxpayer seeking to invalidate a state's apportionment formula must show by clear and cogent evidence that the income attributed to the state is in fact disproportionate to the business transacted in that state.NCR Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-060, 115 N.M. 612, 856 P.2d 982, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 677, 857 P.2d 788, cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1245, 114 S. Ct. 2763, 129 L. Ed. 2d 877 (1994).\n\nApportionment of multinational income.— Under this statutory formula, the income attributable to the state is determined by multiplying the taxpayer's gross income by a fraction which represents the ratio of sales, payroll, and property located in the state to the total sales, payroll, and property of the corporation. This does not violate the Foreign Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution by taxing foreign income because the tax in question is not a tax on any of the domestic corporation's foreign subsidiaries; instead, the tax falls upon an apportioned share of the domestic corporation's income which it receives in the form of royalties, interest, and dividends from its unitary foreign subsidiaries. The fact that the tax is apportioned in part upon the domestic corporation's foreign income sources does not constitute a bar to state taxation.NCR Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-060, 115 N.M. 612, 856 P.2d 982, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 677, 857 P.2d 788, cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1245, 114 S. Ct. 2763, 129 L. Ed. 2d 877 (1994).\n\nTaxation of undistributed earnings.— Because its subsidiaries with Subpart F (26 U.S.C. § 952) income remain part of the parent's unitary business and the federal government requires inclusion of the parent's Subpart F income in gross income, under the unitary business principle, the state assessments in question here do not violate the United States or New Mexico Constitutions, are fairly apportioned, and tax a fair portion of such income even though some of the income is undistributed subsidiary earnings.NCR Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-060, 115 N.M. 612, 856 P.2d 982, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 677, 857 P.2d 788, cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1245, 114 S. Ct. 2763, 129 L. Ed. 2d 877 (1994).",

Ed. 2d 213 (1982).\n\nHearing officer's admission of closing agreement into evidence was not error.— Where taxpayer challenged the use of the department of taxation and revenue's (department) special multistate trucking apportionment regulation to calculate the portion of taxpayer's multistate sales revenue attributable to taxpayer's New Mexico business operations, and where the administrative hearing officer (AHO) found that taxpayer established by clear and cogent evidence that the department's use of the special mileage formula to determine New Mexico's share of taxpayer's multistate revenue for income tax purposes resulted in a gross distortion of taxpayer's actual business activities in New Mexico, contrary to the fair apportionment requirement of the United States constitution's commerce clause and New Mexico's Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (UDIPTA), NMSA 1978, §§ 7-4-1 to 7-4-21, and that taxpayer was entitled to equitable apportionment and that the state-to-state volume method proposed by taxpayer was reasonable, and where the department appealed, claiming that the AHO's admission of a closing agreement for prior tax years was reversible error, there was no error where the AHO specifically explained that the closing agreement was admitted into evidence as relevant to show the origins of the state-to-state volume method proposed by taxpayer and relevant to rebut the department's argument that taxpayer made up the state-to-state volume method without any foundation.United Parcel Serv. v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-064.\n\nTaxpayer entitled to equitable apportionment.— Where taxpayer challenged the use of the department of taxation and revenue's (department) special multistate trucking apportionment regulation to calculate the portion of taxpayer's multistate sales revenue attributable to taxpayer's New Mexico business operations, and where the administrative hearing officer (AHO) found that taxpayer established by clear and cogent evidence that the department's use of the special mileage formula to determine New Mexico's share of taxpayer's multistate revenue for income tax purposes resulted in a gross distortion of taxpayer's actual business activities in New Mexico, contrary to the fair apportionment requirement of the United States constitution's commerce clause and New Mexico's Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (UDIPTA), NMSA 1978, §§ 7-4-1 to 7-4-21, and that taxpayer was entitled to equitable apportionment and that the state-to-state volume method proposed by taxpayer was reasonable, and where the department appealed, claiming that the AHO erred as a matter of law in refusing to apply the department formula to taxpayer because its special mileage formula for apportioning the income of taxpayer for state corporate tax purposes has been found to be a constitutional method of apportioning the revenue of interstate carriers, the AHO did not err in departing from the department's method of apportionment, because NMSA 1978, § 7-4-19(D), provides that if the taxpayer carries its burden, the taxpayer may demand, or the department may require, the employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income, so long as the alternative method is reasonable, and the AHO's finding that taxpayer's state-to-state volume method was a reasonable method of allocating taxpayer's revenue was supported by substantial evidence in the record.United Parcel Serv. v.
