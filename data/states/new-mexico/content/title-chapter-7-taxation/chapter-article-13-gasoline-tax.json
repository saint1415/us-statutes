Every taxpayer who, for the twenty-four month period immediately preceding July 1, 1994, has not been a delinquent taxpayer pursuant to the Gasoline Tax Act is exempt from the requirement pursuant to this section to file a bond. A taxpayer required to file a bond pursuant to the provisions of this section who, for a twenty-four consecutive month period ending after July 1, 1994, has not been a delinquent taxpayer pursuant to the Gasoline Tax Act may request to be exempt from the requirement to file a bond beginning with the first day of the first month following the end of the twenty-four month period.
