      "text": "A. A taxpayer that is an eligible employer may apply for, and the department may allow, a tax credit for each new high-wage job. The credit provided in this section may be referred to as the \"high-wage jobs tax credit\".\n\nB. The purpose of the high-wage jobs tax credit is to provide an incentive for urban and rural businesses to create and fill new high-wage jobs in New Mexico.\n\nC. The high-wage jobs tax credit may be claimed and allowed in an amount equal to eight and one-half percent of the wages distributed to an eligible employee in a new high-wage job but shall not exceed twelve thousand seven hundred fifty dollars ($12,750) per job per qualifying period. The high-wage jobs tax credit may be claimed by an eligible employer for each new high-wage job performed for the year in which the new high-wage job is created and for consecutive qualifying periods.\n\nD. To receive a high-wage jobs tax credit, a taxpayer shall file an application for approval of the credit with the department once per calendar year on forms and in the manner prescribed by the department. The annual application shall contain the certification required by Subsection K of this section and shall contain all qualifying periods that closed during the calendar year for which the application is made. Any qualifying period that did not close in the calendar year for which the application is made shall be denied by the department. The application for a calendar year shall be filed no later than December 31 of the following calendar year. If a taxpayer fails to file the annual application within the time limits provided in this section, the application shall be denied by the department. The department shall make a determination on the application within one hundred eighty days of the date on which the application was filed.\n\nE. A new high-wage job shall not be eligible for a credit pursuant to this section for the initial qualifying period unless the eligible employer's total number of employees with threshold jobs on the last day of the initial qualifying period at the location at which the job is performed or based is at least one more than the number of threshold jobs on the day prior to the date the new high-wage job was created. A new high-wage job shall not be eligible for a credit pursuant to this section for a consecutive qualifying period unless the total number of threshold jobs at a location at which the job is performed or based on the last day of that qualifying period is greater than or equal to the number of threshold jobs at that same location on the last day of the initial qualifying period for the new high-wage job.\n\nF. If a consecutive qualifying period for a new high-wage job does not meet the wage, occupancy and residency requirements, then the qualifying period is ineligible.\n\nG. Except as provided in Subsection H of this section, a new high-wage job shall not be eligible for a credit pursuant to this section if:\n\n(1) the new high-wage job is created due to a business merger or acquisition or other change in business organization;\n\n(2) the eligible employee was terminated from employment in New Mexico by another employer involved in the business merger or acquisition or other change in business organization with the taxpayer; and\n\n(3) the new high-wage job is performed by:\n\n(a) the person who performed the job or its functional equivalent prior to the business merger or acquisition or other change in business organization; or\n\n(b) a person replacing the person who performed the job or its functional equivalent prior to a business merger or acquisition or other change in business organization.\n\nH. A new high-wage job that was created by another employer and for which an application for the high-wage jobs tax credit was received and is under review by the department prior to the time of the business merger or acquisition or other change in business organization shall remain eligible for the high-wage jobs tax credit for the balance of the consecutive qualifying periods. The new employer that results from a business merger or acquisition or other change in business organization may only claim the high-wage jobs tax credit for the balance of the consecutive qualifying periods for which the new high-wage job is otherwise eligible.\n\nI. A new high-wage job shall not be eligible for a credit pursuant to this section if the job is created due to an eligible employer entering into a contract or becoming a subcontractor to a contract with a governmental entity that replaces one or more entities performing functionally equivalent services for the governmental entity unless the job is a new high-wage job that was not being performed by an employee of the replaced entity.\n\nJ. A new high-wage job shall not be eligible for a credit pursuant to this section if the eligible employer has more than one business location in New Mexico from which it conducts business and the requirements of Subsection E of this section are satisfied solely by moving the job from one business location of the eligible employer in New Mexico to another business location of the eligible employer in New Mexico.\n\nK. With respect to each annual application for a high-wage jobs tax credit, the employer shall certify and include:\n\n(1) the amount of wages paid to each eligible employee in a new high-wage job during the qualifying period;\n\n(2) the number of weeks each position was occupied during the qualifying period;\n\n(3) whether the new high-wage job was in a municipality with a population of sixty thousand or more or with a population of less than sixty thousand according to the most recent federal decennial census and whether the job was in the unincorporated area of a county;\n\n(4) which qualifying period the application pertains to for each eligible employee;\n\n(5) the total number of employees employed by the employer at the job location on the day prior to the qualifying period and on the last day of the qualifying period;\n\n(6) the total number of threshold jobs performed or based at the eligible employer's location on the day prior to the qualifying period and on the last day of the qualifying period;\n\n(7) for an eligible employer that has more than one business location in New Mexico from which it conducts business, the total number of threshold jobs performed or based at each business location of the eligible employer in New Mexico on the day prior to the qualifying period and on the last day of the qualifying period;\n\n(8) whether the eligible employer is receiving or is eligible to receive development training program assistance pursuant to Section 21-19-7 NMSA 1978;\n\n(9) whether the eligible employer has ceased business operations at any of its business locations in New Mexico; and\n\n(10) whether the application is precluded by Subsection O of this section.\n\nL. Any person who willfully submits a false, incorrect or fraudulent certification required pursuant to Subsection K of this section shall be subject to all applicable penalties under the Tax Administration Act [Chapter 7, Article 1 NMSA 1978], except that the amount on which the penalty is based shall be the total amount of credit requested on the application for approval.\n\nM. Except as provided in Subsection N of this section, an approved high-wage jobs tax credit shall be claimed against the taxpayer's modified combined tax liability and shall be filed with the return due immediately following the date of the credit approval. If the credit exceeds the taxpayer's modified combined tax liability, the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer.\n\nN. If the taxpayer ceases business operations in New Mexico while an application for credit approval is pending or after an application for credit has been approved for any qualifying period for a new high-wage job, the department shall not grant an additional high-wage jobs tax credit to that taxpayer except as provided in Subsection O of this section and shall extinguish any amount of credit approved for that taxpayer that has not already been claimed against the taxpayer's modified combined tax liability.\n\nO. A taxpayer that has received a high-wage jobs tax credit shall not submit a new application for the credit for a minimum of two calendar years from the closing date of the last qualifying period for which the taxpayer received the credit if the taxpayer lost eligibility to claim the credit from a previous application pursuant to Subsection N of this section.\n\nP. The economic development department and the taxation and revenue department shall report to the appropriate interim legislative committee each year the cost of the high-wage jobs tax credit to the state and its impact on company recruitment and job creation.\n\nQ.

N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep'tandMosaic Potash Carlsbad Inc. v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2021-NMCA-025.\n\nMethodologies for determining whether taxpayers have created a \"new job\" are within the taxation and revenue department's authority.— The taxation and revenue department (department) has the authority to devise means and methods to evaluate whether a taxpayer is entitled to a credit because such powers arise from the statutory language by fair and necessary implication, and therefore it is within the department's authority to employ two different methodologies known as the \"replacement analysis\" and the \"career path promotion analysis\" to determine whether taxpayers have created a \"new job\" for purposes of the high-wage jobs tax credit.Par Five Servs., LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep'tandMosaic Potash Carlsbad Inc. v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2021-NMCA-025.\n\nThe department's use of the \"replacement analysis\" for determining whether taxpayers have created a new job is not unreasonable.— In consolidated appeals, where administrative hearing officers upheld the taxation and revenue department's (department) denial of high-wage jobs tax credits for employees on the basis that the hiring of these employees did not create \"new jobs,\" because the hired employees merely filled vacancies left by employees who had previously held the same job positions, the department's methodology, known as the \"replacement analysis,\" to determine whether taxpayers have created a \"new job\" for purposes of the high-wage jobs tax credit or whether a taxpayer merely filled a vacant preexisting position is reasonable, because the replacement analysis is consistent with the legislative purpose of the high-wage jobs tax credit in that it guards against potential abuse while simultaneously serving as an aid to determine whether a job position is truly \"new\".Par Five Servs., LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep'tandMosaic Potash Carlsbad Inc. v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2021-NMCA-025.\n\nThe department's use of the \"career path promotion analysis\" for determining whether taxpayers have created a \"new job\" is not unreasonable.— Where the taxation and revenue department (department) appealed an administrative hearing officer's reversal of the department's denial of the high-wage jobs tax credit under the \"career path promotion\" analysis, which the department utilizes when an existing employee is promoted to a different position, in order to determine whether a \"new job\" has been created, the hearing officer erred in overturning the department's denial, because the department's use of the \"career path promotion analysis\" is reasonable; the \"career path promotion analysis\" aims to ascertain whether a claimed \"new job\" is actually a new position and to prevent employers from abusing the statutory scheme to generate tax credit awards not contemplated by the legislature.Par Five Servs., LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep'tandMosaic Potash Carlsbad Inc. v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2021-NMCA-025.\n\nDisputing the denial of an application for a high-wage jobs tax credit.— Where taxpayer submitted an application for a high-wage jobs tax credit, which was denied by the Department of Taxation and Revenue (Department), and where taxpayer did not file a written protest to the department's denial of its credit application, pursuant to 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but rather filed an application for refund pursuant to 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, based on its original credit application, which was also denied by the department, and where taxpayer filed a written protest to the denial of its refund application, and where, following multiple hearings before the administrative hearing officer, the department filed a motion for summary judgment, and where the administrative hearing officer granted the department's motion, concluding that the only available remedy for a denial of an application for a tax credit was to file a protest within ninety days of the denial pursuant to 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, and that taxpayer's failure to file such a protest rendered the department's denial indisputable, the administrative hearing officer erred in granting the department's motion for summary judgment and denying taxpayer's protest, because neither the applicable statutes nor the department's own guidance suggest that a taxpayer's sole remedy to dispute the denial of a high-wage jobs tax credit is through the protest procedures provided in 7-1-24 NMSA 1978. The plain language of both 7-1-24 and 7-1-26 NMSA 1978 indicates that the two statutes exist as alternatives and a taxpayer may dispute a denial of a tax credit under either statute.Elite Well v.
