A taxpayer that has applied for and been granted approval for an additional credit by the department pursuant to the Technology Jobs and Research and Development Tax Credit Act may claim the amount of the approved additional credit against the taxpayer's income tax or corporate income tax liability. Except as provided in Subsection C of this section, no taxpayer may claim an amount of approved additional credit for a taxable year in which the additional credit is being claimed that exceeds the amount of the taxpayer's income tax or corporate income tax due for that taxable year.\n\nC. If a taxpayer is a qualified research and development small business and the amount of approved additional credit for the taxable year in which the additional credit is being claimed exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability or corporate income tax liability, the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer pursuant to Paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection. If the taxpayer's total qualified expenditures for the taxable year for which the claim is made is:\n\n(1) less than three million dollars ($3,000,000), the excess additional credit shall be refunded to the taxpayer;\n\n(2) greater than or equal to three million dollars ($3,000,000) and less than four million dollars ($4,000,000), two-thirds of the excess additional credit shall be refunded to the taxpayer; and\n\n(3) greater than or equal to four million dollars ($4,000,000) and less than or equal to five million dollars ($5,000,000), one-third of the excess additional credit shall be refunded to the taxpayer.\n\nD. Any amount of approved additional credit not claimed against the taxpayer's income tax or corporate income tax due for a taxable year or refunded to the taxpayer may be claimed in subsequent reporting periods for a period of up to three years from the date of the original claim.\n\nE. Married individuals filing separate returns for a taxable year for which they could have filed a joint return may each claim only one-half of the additional credit that would have been claimed on a joint return.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 7-9F-9.1, enacted by Laws 2015 (1st S.S.) ch. 2, § 17.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2015 (1st S.S.), ch. 2 § 26 makes Laws 2015 (1st S.S.), ch. 2, § 17 effective January 1, 2016.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2015 (1st S.S.), ch. 2, § 25 provided that Laws 2015 (1st S.S.), ch. 2, § 17 apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015 and apply to taxpayers that make a qualified expenditure beginning on or after January 1, 2015.",
