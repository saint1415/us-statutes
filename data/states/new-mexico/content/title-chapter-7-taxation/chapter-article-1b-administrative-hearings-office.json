In the event the taxpayer first requests a hearing with the administrative hearings office, the taxation and revenue department shall, within thirty days of service of the taxpayer's request for a hearing, file its answer to the protest describing the legal and factual bases supporting the department's position beyond an assertion of the presumption of correctness. The department may amend its answer to the protest up until ten days before the scheduled hearing or other deadline specified in a controlling scheduling order; provided that if the administrative hearings office determines that the department's amended answer unfairly prejudices the taxpayer, the administrative hearings office may disallow the amended answer. The hearing shall be limited to the grounds provided in the taxpayer's protest letter and in the department's answer to the protest.\n\nE. If the hearing officer finds that the taxation and revenue department failed to comply with the deadlines set forth in Subsections A and B of this section, the hearing officer may order that no further interest may accrue on the protested liability.\n\nF.

Either party may, within ten days of notice of hearing assigning a hearing officer or notice of reassignment of a hearing officer, exercise one time the peremptory right to excuse the hearing officer designated to conduct the hearing; provided that the party has not moved for a discretionary ruling from the assigned hearing officer, nor previously exercised its right of peremptory excusal. Once a hearing officer has been peremptorily excused, that hearing officer shall not be assigned to the case again.\n\nG.
