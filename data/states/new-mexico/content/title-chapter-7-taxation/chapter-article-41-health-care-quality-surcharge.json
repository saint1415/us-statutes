No later than sixty days following the effective date of the Health Care Quality Surcharge Act and by June 1 of each year thereafter, the human services department [health care authority department] shall calculate the rate of the surcharge to be paid by each health care facility during the subsequent fiscal year and shall notify the taxation and revenue department and each such health care facility of the applicable rates.

If the rate of net revenue provided in Paragraph (2) or (3) of Subsection B of this section exceeds the maximum percentage of net revenue for all health care facilities allowed by Section 1903(w)(4) of the federal Social Security Act, as that section may be amended or renumbered, the rate of the health care quality surcharge shall be reduced to a percentage that will equal, but not exceed, the maximum percentage allowed by that federal law.\n\nD.
