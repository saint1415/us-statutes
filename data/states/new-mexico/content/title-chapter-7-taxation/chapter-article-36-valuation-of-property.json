      "heading": "Allocation of responsibility for valuation and determining classification of property for property taxation purposes; county assessor and department.",
      "text": "A. The county assessor is responsible and has the authority for the valuation of all property subject to valuation for property taxation purposes in the county except the property specified by Subsections B and C of this section.\n\nB. The department is responsible and has the authority for the valuation of all property subject to valuation for property taxation purposes and used in the conduct of the following businesses:\n\n(1) railroad;\n\n(2) communications system as that term is defined in Section 7-36-30 NMSA 1978;\n\n(3) pipeline;\n\n(4) public utility; and\n\n(5) airline.\n\nC. The department is responsible and has the authority for the valuation of property subject to valuation for property taxation purposes when that property is:\n\n(1) an electricity generating plant, whether or not owned by a public utility, if all or part of the electricity is generated for ultimate sale to the consuming public;\n\n(2) mineral property and property held or used in connection with mineral property as defined in Sections 7-36-22 through 7-36-25 NMSA 1978; or\n\n(3) machinery, equipment and other personal property of all resident and nonresident persons customarily engaged in construction that involves the use during a tax year of the machinery, equipment and other personal property in more than one county. For the purposes of this paragraph, \"construction\" means leveling or clearing land, excavating earth, drilling wells of any type, including seismograph shot holes or core drilling, or similar work, or building, altering, repairing or demolishing any:\n\n(a) road, highway, bridge, parking area or related project;\n\n(b) building, fence, stadium or other structure;\n\n(c) airport, subway or similar facility;\n\n(d) park, trail, athletic field, golf course or similar facility;\n\n(e) dam, reservoir, canal, ditch or similar facility;\n\n(f) sewerage or water treatment facility, power generating plant, pump station, natural gas compressing station, gas processing plant, coal gasification plant, refinery, distillery or similar facility;\n\n(g) sewerage, water, gas or other pipeline;\n\n(h) transmission line;\n\n(i) radio, television or other tower;\n\n(j) water, oil or other storage tank;\n\n(k) shaft, tunnel or other mining appurtenance; or\n\n(l) similar work.\n\nD. The entity having responsibility and authority for valuing the property described in Subsections A through C of this section shall also have responsibility and authority for classifying that property as either residential or nonresidential under the provisions of Section 7-36-2.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nE. The secretary by regulation may delegate authority to the county assessor for the valuation and classification of property subject to valuation for property taxation purposes for which the department is responsible pursuant to Subsections B through D of this section only if:\n\n(1) the property is held or used in connection with the transmission, storage, measurement or distribution of water and the transmission, storage, measurement and distribution is conducted by a single person entirely within a single county; or\n\n(2) the property is held or used in connection with a communications system as defined in Section 7-36-30 NMSA 1978 and the system operates entirely within a single county.\n\nF. The department is authorized to enter into one or more agreements with each county assessor, subject to approval of each agreement by the appropriate board of county commissioners, under which the county assessor agrees to perform the valuation of property for which the department is responsible under Subsection B of this section but which property is not subject to the special methods of valuation set forth in Sections 7-36-27, 7-36-28 and 7-36-30 through 7-36-32 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-29-2, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 14; 1974, ch. 92, § 5; 1975, ch. 156, § 1; 1975, ch. 165, § 1; 1981, ch. 37, § 62; 1985, ch. 109, § 2; 1995, ch. 12, § 6.\n\nCross references.— For county assessors,seeChapter 4, Article 39 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, substituted \"department\" for \"division\" in the section heading and in Subsections B, C, and E; inserted \"gas processing plant, coal gasification plant, refinery, distillery\" in Subparagraph C(3)(f); substituted \"secretary\" for \"director\" near the beginning of Subsection E; and added Subsection F.\n\nDifferent tax treatment based on use of contractor's equipment unconstitutional.— Since the effect of former 7-36-9 NMSA 1978 and 72-6-4A(1)(c), 1953 Comp. (predecessor of this section), was that contractors whose machinery and equipment was used in more than one county were subject to property tax on sales inventories, and contractors whose machinery and equipment was not used in more than one county were not subject to property tax on sales inventories, this difference in tax treatment based solely on whether a contractor uses his equipment in more than one county was arbitrary and resulted in a denial of equal protection of the law; therefore, to the extent that valuation by the property appraisal department deprives the taxpayer of the exemption in former 7-36-9 NMSA 1978, that section is unconstitutional.Halliburton Co. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1975-NMCA-123, 88 N.M. 476, 542 P.2d 56.\n\nUse of equipment in multiple counties cannot be defended on basis of administrative convenience.— A classification based solely on the use of machinery and equipment in more than one county is patently unreasonable, and cannot be defended on the basis of assessment procedures. Administrative convenience in arriving at a valuation of the property involved does not show a rational basis for taxing inventories of contractors who report value to the property appraisal department rather than to the county assessor. The fact that taxpayers may reasonably be required to report their property values to different government offices because of differences in geographic operations does not provide a reasonable basis for a difference in tax treatment on the values reported.Halliburton Co. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1975-NMCA-123, 88 N.M. 476, 542 P.2d 56.\n\nMineral value taxed centrally.— In New Mexico, any mineral value, whether held in fee or as severed minerals, may only be classified and valued by the state tax commission (now taxation and revenue department).Gerner v. State Tax Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-022, 71 N.M. 385, 378 P.2d 619.\n\nDirector, not court, to choose between conflicting inferences.— Decision of the director supported by substantial evidence that taxpayer contractor's activities, which were performed prior to production from a well, in the usual course of business, involving the use of machinery and equipment commonly used in the course of drilling an oil and gas well came within 72-6-4A(1)(c), 1953 Comp. (now Section 7-36-2C(3) NMSA 1978), was affirmed since although there was conflicting evidence and it was for the director to choose between conflicting inferences.Halliburton Co. v. Prop. Appraisal Dep't, 1975-NMCA-123, 88 N.M. 476, 542 P.2d 56.\n\nUse of machinery and equipment sufficient.— Section 72-6-4A(1)(c), 1953 Comp. (now Section 7-36-2C(3) NMSA 1978), by its terms, did not require a company to be the drilling contractor; the contractor's work must involve the use of, but not be limited to, machinery and equipment commonly used in oil and gas well drilling.Halliburton Co. v. Prop. Appraisal Dep't, 1975-NMCA-123, 88 N.M. 476, 542 P.2d 56.\n\nAssessed value is not competent direct evidenceof value for purposes other than taxation.Gomez v. Board of Educ., 1966-NMSC-095, 76 N.M. 305, 414 P.2d 522.\n\nValuation of livestock.— Subsection D of Section 7-36-21 NMSA 1978 does not allocate valuation of livestock responsibility to the division (department); instead, that section simply requires the division (department) to supervise the assessor by establishing classes of livestock and values for those classes of livestock. While the division (department) must establish general criteria for valuing livestock, the county assessor does the actual valuation.Zwaagstra v. DelCurto, 1992-NMCA-087, 114 N.M. 263, 837 P.2d 457.\n\nDepartment found in contempt for failing to value and assess high-voltage transmission lines for property taxes.— Where petitioners petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department) to establish values for two high-voltage transmission lines in Harding county and report those values to the Harding county assessor so that property taxes could be assessed on the lines, and where the district court issued the peremptory writ, determining that the transmission lines were taxable, and ordered the department to complete the valuation processes for the two transmission lines, timely conclude any protests, and certify the values to the county assessor for preparation of a bill for the property tax due, and where, following an administrative hearing officer's conclusion that the transmission lines did not have any value for tax assessment purposes, the department certified that the transmission were not taxable, which was contrary to the district court's order, and certified to the district court that the department complied with the court's order, and where petitioners then filed a motion for an order to show cause, arguing that the department had not complied with the peremptory writ, the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding the department in contempt and in awarding petitioners attorney fees as sanctions, because the department admittedly failed to act in accordance with the dictates of the law after the district court ordered the department to act and after the department was given notice and an opportunity to be heard.Harding Cnty. Bd. of Comm'rs v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2021-NMSC-007,aff'gA-1-CA-36305, mem. op. (May 24, 2019) (nonprecedential).\n\nAm.

As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"fractional interest\" means a tangible interest in real property, except for mineral property as defined in Section 7-36-22 NMSA 1978, that is less than the total of the interests existing in the property, but \"fractional interest\" does not include those property interests described in Sections 7-36-3, 7-36-3.1 and 7-36-3.2 NMSA 1978 nor does it include the lessee's interest under a lease when the term of the lease is more than seventy-five years;\n\n(2) \"exempt entity\" means any person whose real property is exempt from taxation under the constitution of New Mexico or the Enabling Act (36 Stat. 557, as amended) by reason of ownership;\n\n(3) \"exempt property\" means property that is exempt from property taxation pursuant to Article 8, Section 3 of the constitution of New Mexico by reason of use;\n\n(4) \"improvements\" includes surface and subsurface structures, fixtures, transmission lines, pipelines and other works, but \"improvements\" does not include:\n\n(a) that property either included or specifically excluded under the terms \"property used in connection with mineral property\" under Section 7-36-23 NMSA 1978, \"property used in connection with potash mineral property\" under Section 7-36-24 NMSA 1978 and \"property used in connection with uranium mineral property\" under Section 7-36-25 NMSA 1978;\n\n(b) a dwelling occupied by a low-income resident in a housing project authorized under the provisions of the Municipal Housing Law [Chapter 3, Article 45 NMSA 1978]; and\n\n(c) those property interests described in Sections 7-36-3, 7-36-3.1 and 7-36-3.2 NMSA 1978;\n\n(5) \"nonexempt entity\" means any person that is not an exempt entity; and\n\n(6) \"nonexempt property\" means property that is not exempt property.\n\nB. Fractional interests of nonexempt entities in real property of exempt entities are exempt from property taxation under the Property Tax Code, but this exemption shall not apply to the following property:\n\n(1) improvements of land of an exempt entity if the improvements are owned or leased by a nonexempt entity; these improvements are subject to valuation for property taxation purposes and to property taxation to be paid by the nonexempt entity; and\n\n(2) property interests of nonexempt entities held under equitable title in the property of exempt entities.\n\nC.

Except for the property listed in Subsection B of this section or exempt pursuant to Section 7-36-8 NMSA 1978, all property is subject to valuation for property taxation purposes under the Property Tax Code if it has a taxable situs in the state.\n\nB. The following property is not subject to valuation for property taxation purposes under the Property Tax Code:\n\n(1) property exempt from property taxation under the federal or state constitution, federal law, the Property Tax Code or other laws, but:\n\n(a) this does not include property all or a part of the value of which is exempt because of the application of the veteran, disabled veteran or head-of-family exemption;\n\n(b) this provision does not excuse an owner from obligations to report the owner's property as required by regulation of the department adopted under Section 7-38-8.1 NMSA 1978 or to claim its exempt status under Subsection C of Section 7-38-17 NMSA 1978;\n\n(c) this includes property of a museum that: 1) has been granted exemption from the federal income tax by the United States commissioner of internal revenue as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or renumbered; 2) is used to provide educational services; and 3) grants free admission to each student who attends a public school in the county in which the museum is located; and\n\n(d) this includes property that is operated either as a community to which the Continuing Care Act [Chapter 24, Article 17 NMSA 1978] applies or as a facility licensed by the department of health to operate as a nursing facility, a skilled nursing facility, an adult residential care facility, an intermediate care facility or an intermediate care facility for the developmentally disabled; and is owned by a charitable nursing, retirement or long-term care organization that: 1) has been granted exemption from the federal income tax by the United States commissioner of internal revenue as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or renumbered; 2) donates or renders gratuitously a portion of its services or facilities; and 3) uses all funds remaining after payment of its usual and necessary expenses of operation, including the payment of liens and encumbrances upon its property, to further its charitable purpose, including the maintenance, improvement or expansion of its facilities;\n\n(2) oil and gas property subject to valuation and taxation under the Oil and Gas Ad Valorem Production Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 32 NMSA 1978] and the Oil and Gas Production Equipment Ad Valorem Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 34 NMSA 1978]; and\n\n(3) productive copper mineral property subject to valuation and taxation under the Copper Production Ad Valorem Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 39 NMSA 1978]; for the purposes of this section, \"copper mineral property\" means all mineral property and property held in connection with mineral property when seventy-five percent or more, by either weight or value, of the salable mineral extracted from or processed by the mineral property is copper.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-29-3, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 15; 1981, ch. 37, § 53; 1982, ch. 28, § 3; 1990, ch. 125, § 3; 1995, ch. 12, § 9; 2000, ch. 92, § 2; 2000, ch. 94, § 2; 2001, ch. 217, § 1; 2008, ch. 46, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For constitutional provision as to equality in ad valorem taxation,seeN.M.

VIII, § 3 of the New Mexico constitution, the county assessor had standing to challenge the constitutionality of 7-36-7(B)(1)(d) NMSA 1978, because a justiciable controversy existed with regard to petitioner's claim of entitlement to a tax exemption and the county assessor is responsible and has the authority for the valuation of all property subject to valuation for property tax purposes.El Castillo Ret. Residences v. Martinez, 2017-NMSC-026,aff'g2015-NMCA-041, andoverrulingLa Vida Llena v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-048, 299 P.3d 456.\n\nConstitutional limitation on the legislature's power.— N.M. Const., art. VIII, § 3 operates as a limit on the legislature's power to redefine categories of property which will be exempt from taxation, and 7-36-7(B)(1)(d) NMSA 1978 may not be interpreted or applied to grant exemptions that are not authorized by art. VIII, § 3.El Castillo Ret. Residences v. Martinez, 2017-NMSC-026,aff'g2015-NMCA-041, andoverrulingLa Vida Llena v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-048, 299 P.3d 456.\n\nWhere the Santa Fe county assessor appealed the district court's decision that petitioner, a retirement and continuing care community, was improperly denied a charitable property tax exemption, the New Mexico supreme court held that the district court erred in concluding that petitioner fulfilled the charitable use requirements for tax exemption under art. VIII, § 3 of the New Mexico constitution, because petitioner, a self-sustaining community that accepts and benefits only financially and medically screened residents based on requirements calculated in the interests of financial security for itself, did not create any substantial public benefit and therefore cannot be entitled to exemption from taxation under 7-36-7(B)(1)(d) NMSA 1978 or N.M. Const., art. VIII, § 3.El Castillo Ret. Residences v. Martinez, 2017-NMSC-026,aff'g2015-NMCA-041, andoverrulingLa Vida Llena v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-048, 299 P.3d 456.\n\nDepartment found in contempt for failing to value and assess high-voltage transmission lines for property taxes.— Where petitioners petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department) to establish values for two high-voltage transmission lines in Harding county and report those values to the Harding county assessor so that property taxes could be assessed on the lines, and where the district court issued the peremptory writ, determining that the transmission lines were taxable, and ordered the department to complete the valuation processes for the two transmission lines, timely conclude any protests, and certify the values to the county assessor for preparation of a bill for the property tax due, and where, following an administrative hearing officer's conclusion that the transmission lines did not have any value for tax assessment purposes, the department certified that the transmission lines were not taxable, which was contrary to the district court's order, and certified to the district court that the department complied with the court's order, and where petitioners then filed a motion for an order to show cause, arguing that the department had not complied with the peremptory writ, the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding the department in contempt and in awarding petitioners attorney fees as sanctions, because the department admittedly failed to act in accordance with the dictates of the law after the district court ordered the department to act and after the department was given notice and an opportunity to be heard.Harding Cnty. Bd. of Comm'rs v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2021-NMSC-007,aff'gA-1-CA-36305, mem. op. (May 24, 2019) (nonprecedential).\n\nProperty operated under the Continuing Care Act.— Section 7-36-7(B)(1)(d) NMSA 1978 does not require a minimum amount of donated or gratuitously rendered services or facilities for charitable purposes in order for a continuing care facility to receive the property tax exemption.La Vida Llena v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-048, 299 P.3d 456.\n\nWhere protestant operated a continuing care facility pursuant to the Continuing Care Act, Section 24-17-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., had been granted an exemption from federal taxes, used all funds remaining after payment of its usual and necessary expenses of operation to further its charitable purpose, provided services to some medicare residents when the cost of their care exceeded medicare reimbursement, permitted its staff time to serve other charitable organizations, provided services for its foundation, and did not terminate resident agreements when residents did not pay, protestant donated or rendered gratuitously some part of its facilities and services for charitable services and was entitled to receive the property tax exemption.La Vida Llena v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-048, 299 P.3d 456.\n\nProperty to provide educational services.— Property devoted primarily and substantially to traditional museum functions of: (1) the preservation and exhibition of significant aspects, artifacts, and works of our lives and history for the benefit of the general public's appreciation, study, and knowledge; and (2) the carrying on of museum-related educational programs and activities such as lectures, studies, publishing scholarly materials, and creating instructional materials, is property with uses and purposes that ought to be considered for educational purposes tax exemption pursuant to the state constitution.Georgia O'Keefe Museum v. County of Santa Fe, 2003-NMCA-003, 133 N.M. 297, 62 P.3d 754.\n\nTo qualify for the educational purposes tax exemption, a museum must adhere to a systematic approach to learning. This requires an ordered, methodical, structured, and regular learning opportunity provided by the museum owner whose primary goal and major purpose through the museum is to impart knowledge and information in order to educate the public in respect to a branch of learning and it requires substantial public benefit.Georgia O'Keefe Museum v. County of Santa Fe, 2003-NMCA-003, 133 N.M. 297, 62 P.3d 754.\n\nIndian lands and property exempt.— New Mexico Const., art. XXI, § 2, clearly precludes state from taxing Indian lands and Indian property on the reservation.Prince v. Board of Educ., 1975-NMSC-068, 88 N.M. 548, 543 P.2d 1176.\n\nPrivate non-Indian corporations cannot escape obligation to pay state taxesby locating their property on Indian reservations. Nothing forbids the imposition of such a tax, since it does not in any way infringe on the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.Prince v. Board of Educ., 1975-NMSC-068, 88 N.M. 548, 543 P.2d 1176.\n\nState may tax property of corporation leasing land from Indian tribe.— Nothing prevents New Mexico from imposing a tax on the property of non-Indian corporations leasing land from the Navajo tribe, despite the fact that the property might be located on the reservation, because although the land itself cannot be taxed, the non-Indian property, which does not belong to and may not be acquired by the United States or reserved for its use, can. As private property owned by non-Indians who are not performing a federal function, it is subject to the taxing powers of this state.Prince v. Board of Educ., 1975-NMSC-068, 88 N.M. 548, 543 P.2d 1176.\n\nLease to construct housing on federal land subject to tax.— Congress having explicitly removed the bar of sovereign immunity as it applied to property belonging to the United States, the immunity granted the federal government by N.M. Const., art. VIII, § 3, and art. XXI, § 2, clearly was not available to one who had lease to construct military housing on federal land. It was his interest that was subject to taxation.Kirtland Heights, Inc. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1958-NMSC-066, 64 N.M. 179, 326 P.2d 672.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —71 Am.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nExclusive reliance on evidence of prior year comparable sales was reasonable.— With respect to comparable sales, the legislature intended assessors and protests boards to consider only data available on January 1 of the tax year of the valuation notice.AMREP Sw., Inc. v. Sandoval Cnty. Assessor, 2012-NMCA-082, 284 P.3d 1118.\n\nWhere the county valuation protests board refused to consider the taxpayer's comparable 2009 sales evidence and relied exclusively on comparable 2008 sales for the valuation of the taxpayer's property for the 2009 tax year based on the board's interpretation of statutory and administrative code provisions that required property to be valued using only data available on January 1, 2009, the board's interpretation of the statutory and administrative code provisions was reasonable.AMREP Sw., Inc. v. Sandoval Cnty. Assessor, 2012-NMCA-082, 284 P.3d 1118.\n\nAssessor's valuation sufficient evidence.— Since the assessor's valuation is presumed to be correct it is sufficient evidence, where uncontradicted, to support the board's decision.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nHow presumption of assessor's valuation may be overcome.— The statutory presumption of correctness of the value of property by the county assessor for tax purposes can be overcome by a taxpayer showing that the assessor did not follow the applicable statutory provisions, or by presenting evidence tending to dispute the factual correctness of the valuation.La Jara Land Developers, Inc. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1982-NMCA-006, 97 N.M. 318, 639 P.2d 605.\n\nAdmission of taxpayer's evidence when market value indeterminable.— The protests board could not rely exclusively on the county assessor's valuation of property even though, according to 72-2-3, 1953 Comp., the assessment must be at \"full actual value,\" and neither could it rely on comparable sales or sales of comparable lands where none have occurred; accordingly, the board should have allowed the admission of the only available relevant evidence which the taxpayer had. In situations where cash market value could not be determined, earning capacity, cost of reproduction and original cost less depreciation furnished relevant considerations for determining \"value.\"In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70,rev'd on other grounds, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142 (1976) (decided under prior law).\n\nPresumption of assessor's valuation not overcome.— Since taxpayer failed to present any evidence of sales of comparable property or evidence of value based on generally accepted appraisal techniques, and its only evidence, the purchase price of its land in question, did not establish a market value under Subsection B, the presumption of the correctness of the assessor's valuation was not overcome.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nPresumption of assessor's valuation not overcome.— The presumption of the correctness of the assessor's valuation was not overcome by the taxpayers' offer, as evidence of market value, the price for which they purchased the property, where the sales price was not the result of an arms'-length transaction because of the taxpayers' mailing campaign to convince landowners to sell their property to the taxpayers at below market prices.In re Cobb, 1991-NMCA-122, 113 N.M. 251, 824 P.2d 1053, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 44, 822 P.2d 1127 (1992).\n\nTaxpayer rebutted presumption of assessor's valuation.— Since taxpayers presented uncontradicted evidence that access to their property was physically blocked and also offered the only substantial evidence of the fair market value of the property in the form of testimony by a real estate appraiser that because of the lack of access the highest and best use that the property could be put to was as grazing land by one of the adjoining landowners, and that as such it had a fair market value of $18.00 per acre, or $2034 and $5022 respectively for the two tracts, they effectively rebutted the presumption of 7-38-6 NMSA 1978 that the county assessor's valuations of $313,875 and $169,500 were correct.Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.\n\nWhen county assessor did not follow any statutory method of valuationin 1976, but simply set the valuation of a shopping center back up to the 1972 figure, the decisions of the board were arbitrary and capricious, not supported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole, and otherwise not in accordance with law, and its orders were vacated.San Pedro S. Group v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1976-NMCA-116, 89 N.M. 784, 558 P.2d 53.\n\nScope of \"structures and equipment\" in Subsection C.— The inclusion of Subsection C indicated that the exemption from separate valuation for the structures and equipment listed in Subsection C is not limited to structures and equipment used for the purposes of irrigation or stock-watering, but applies to all such structures and equipment.Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corp. v. Property Tax Div., 1980-NMCA-063, 95 N.M. 685, 625 P.2d 1202.\n\nNo denial of due process in failure to adopt regulations.— Taxpayer was not denied due process because the property tax department did not adopt regulations that listed the procedures to be followed, and identified the methods of valuation in general use by the department and the applicable factors to be included in determining the value of property, since the amended statute did not require regulations, and taxpayer had the right of discovery by deposition of all the facts necessary to defend the assessed valuation of its property.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nFailure to require equalization does not establish official interpretation.— The fact that state officials have, for years, known that there are inequalities or lack of uniformity in tax assessments and have done nothing about it does not establish this as official \"long-standing interpretation.\" It is, in essence, merely long-standing failure by respondents and their predecessors to require equalization as plainly required by the constitution and the legislative enactments.State ex rel. Castillo Corp. v. N.M. Tax Comm'n, 1968-NMSC-117, 79 N.M. 357, 443 P.2d 850.\n\nHonest judgment most important.— What is most important is that the appraisers, the assessor and the protest board exercise an honest judgment based upon the information they possess or are able to acquire.First Nat'l Bank v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1977-NMCA-005, 90 N.M. 110, 560 P.2d 174.\n\nSovereign immunity not applicable in mandamus of assessment ratio.— In a mandamus proceeding to require the performance of a duty plainly required under the constitution, i.e., to prescribe an assessment ratio so that property shall be uniformly assessed in proportion to its value, the sovereign immunity doctrine is not applicable.State ex rel. Castillo Corp. v. N.M. Tax Comm'n, 1968-NMSC-117, 79 N.M. 357, 443 P.2d 850.\n\nII. MARKET VALUE.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\n\"Market value\"means a price which a purchaser, willing but not obliged to buy, would pay an owner, willing but not obliged to sell, taking into consideration all uses to which the property is adapted and might in reason be applied.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nUsual factors which are considered in ascertaining fair market valueof any given tract of land are its size, shape, location, topography, accessibility to roads, availability of public utilities and comparable sales, and, in a given instance, one factor may far outweigh all the rest in importance.Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.\n\nLegislature gave priority to first method of valuation,a valuation determined by sales of comparable property. It did not do so with reference to the succeeding methods. If the legislature intended to give priority to the second method, the \"income method,\" over the third method, the \"cost method,\" for any reason, it would have phrased the section in language similar to the priority established in the first method of valuation.First Nat'l Bank v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1977-NMCA-005, 90 N.M. 110, 560 P.2d 174.\n\nProof of purchase price alone is not sufficient to fix market valuewithout evidence of the details of the sale.Cobb v. Otero Cnty. Assessor, 1983-NMCA-090, 100 N.M. 207, 668 P.2d 323.\n\nMarket value not an absolute.— Subsection B makes it clear that market value is not a given or an absolute, it is only a method of determining value.National Potash Co. v. Property Tax Div., 1984-NMCA-055, 101 N.M. 404, 683 P.2d 521.\n\nExplanation necessary when market value not used for valuation.— If market value is not used as the basis for calculating assessed valuation, the assessor must explain why that approach is not appropriate, or that there is a lack of adequate market data.Protest of Plaza Del Sol Ltd. P'ship v. Assessor for Cnty. of Bernalillo, 1986-NMCA-022, 104 N.M. 154, 717 P.2d 1123.\n\nPast or future value not to serve as basis.— What the fair market value of a tract may have been in the past or speculation as to what it might be in the future cannot serve as the basis for valuation.Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620;Bakel v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1980-NMCA-173, 95 N.M. 723, 625 P.2d 1240.\n\nPast market value.— Evidence of what the fair market value of a tract may have been in the past cannot properly be utilized as the sole basis for valuation of the property for tax purposes.La Jara Land Developers, Inc. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1982-NMCA-006, 97 N.M. 318, 639 P.2d 605.\n\nUse of mass appraisal method upheld.— The use by the county assessor of the mass appraisal methodology to value plaintiffs' undeveloped property for tax assessment purposes was permissible under this statute when the method was based on standard appraisal procedure, such as comparable sales, and the resulting valuation bore a reasonable relationship to the market value.In re Cobb, 1991-NMCA-122, 113 N.M. 251, 824 P.2d 1053, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 44, 822 P.2d 1127.\n\nUsing one uniform percentage depreciation factor for property valuation improper.— Any property valuation method which uses one uniform percentage depreciation factor, regardless of the age of the property, is an improper method of determining property value; such a method would not, except by mere coincidence, yield a value consistent with the fair market value of the property.Anaconda Co. v. Prop. Tax Dep't, 1979-NMCA-158, 94 N.M. 202, 608 P.2d 514, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 628, 614 P.2d 545.\n\nInsufficient evidence to support county assessor's method of valuation.— Where appellant sought review of the Bernalillo county valuation protests board's valuation of appellant's commercial property, and where the county assessor testified that the assessor applies a forty-five percent limitation on operating expenses rather than applying the taxpayer's actual reported expenses, but absent data that forty-five percent is an appropriate limitation on operating expenses in this market, for this property type, and during this time period, there was insufficient evidence such that a reasonable person could conclude that the county assessor's application of the income valuation method utilized generally accepted appraisal techniques.2727 San Pedro LLC v. Bernalillo Cty. Assessor, 2017-NMCA-008.\n\nB. COMPARABLE SALES METHOD.\n\n\"Comparable property\"is property similar to the property being appraised, which has been recently sold or is currently being offered for sale in the same or competing areas.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074;New Mexico Baptist Found. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1979-NMCA-102, 93 N.M. 363, 600 P.2d 309.\n\n\"Comparable\"is defined as capable of being compared with, worthy of comparison, and thus must necessarily include dissimilarities as well as similarities.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\n\"To compare\".— In reviewing sales of other properties, \"to compare\" means to examine the characteristics or qualities of one or more properties for the purpose of discovering their resemblances or differences; the aim is to show relative values by bringing out characteristic qualities, whether similar or divergent, and thus, comparisons based on sales may be made according to location, age and condition of improvements, income and expense, use, size, type of construction and in numerous other ways.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nBest method is use of comparable sales.— The best method of ascertaining what a willing and informed buyer would pay a willing and informed seller in usual circumstances in light of the highest and best use to which the property may be put in the not too distant future is through the use of comparable sales.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nReasonable cash market value, reflected by comparable property sales, is relevantfor determining the correct valuation of a piece of property, if there have been such sales.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nWhen comparable sales evidence not presented.— Since the documents relied upon by a taxpayer as evidence of comparable sales are documents dealing with the sale of that very improvement whose valuation is the subject of the present dispute and the only evidence submitted by the taxpayer is the purchase price of the land in question, the taxpayer failed to present any evidence of sales of comparable property and the evidence submitted does not establish a market value under Subsection B and the statutory presumption of correctness of valuation for tax purposes still stands.N.M. Baptist Found. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1979-NMCA-102, 93 N.M. 363, 600 P.2d 309.\n\nTest of comparable sales relevancy left to court's discretion.— The rule regarding comparable sales is one of relevancy and, not unlike the general evidentiary rule applied in all proceedings, requiring similarity of conditions. The test is usually left to the discretion of the court in light of the circumstances of each case.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nC. INCOME OR COST METHOD.\n\nWhen income or cost method of valuation utilized.— Since, if reliable comparable sales data can be reasonably obtained, the comparable sales method must be used, the taxpayer has the burden to demonstrate either that comparable sales data is not reasonably obtainable or that it would be unreliable. To demonstrate a lack of reliability, the taxpayer might show that the location, access, utilities or other such factors distinguish his property from other such properties. If the taxpayer is able to show that the comparable sales method should not be utilized, then the income method or cost method must be used.Bakel v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1980-NMCA-173, 95 N.M. 723, 625 P.2d 1240.\n\nMethods of valuation.— If the \"cost method\" or \"income method\" is employed as the primary mode of ascertaining the value of property for tax purposes, the appraiser must determine that there is a lack of comparable sales data precluding utilization of the first method of valuation and support this determination by substantial evidence.La Jara Land Developers, Inc. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1982-NMCA-006, 97 N.M. 318, 639 P.2d 605.\n\nIncome method inapplicable to agricultural land.— By its plain terms, the income method set forth in this section does not apply to land classified as agricultural. Agricultural land is to be valued based on its capacity to produce, not on its actual production.Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rio Arriba Cnty. Assessor, 2004-NMCA-055, 135 N.M. 630, 92 P.3d 642,rev'd, 2004-NMSC-035, 136 N.M. 630, 103 P.3d 554.\n\nIII. EVIDENCE.\n\nTaxing authority may rely on any relevant evidence.— In assessing property for taxation the taxing authority may rely on any evidence that is relevant. Assessor's evidence of a sale of a smaller tract of land in the same vicinity was substantial and supported the board's decision.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nRelevant evidence includes that of ratios of assessed value to market value.— To arrive at uniformity in the assessment of property for taxation, as provided in N.M. Const., art. VIII, §§ 1 and 2, the taxing authority and the taxpayer can introduce evidence regarding the ratios of assessed values to market values as the latter are reflected in actual sales of any other real estate in the taxing district for a reasonable period prior to the assessment date.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nNo denial of due process in exclusion of irrelevant evidence.— Since former Subsection B of this section fixed two methods of determining market value, namely sales of comparable property and the application of generally accepted appraisal techniques, taxpayer's offer of evidence of a valuation of comparable property was not relevant and exclusion of such evidence did not deny taxpayer of due process.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nAppraiser's acceptance of hearsay destroys weight of his opinions.— An expert appraiser's blanket acceptance of hearsay information and his failure to consider influencing facts in so-called \"comparable sales\" all but destroys any weight that might be given to his opinions.Four Hills Country Club v. Bernalillo Cnty. Property Tax Protest Bd., 1979-NMCA-141, 94 N.M. 709, 616 P.2d 422.\n\nSection does not give taxpayers right to determine method of valuation,but gives the county assessor the right to use either the \"income method or cost methods of valuation.\"First Nat'l Bank v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1977-NMCA-005, 90 N.M. 110, 560 P.2d 174.\n\nTaxpayer has right to discover method of valuation usedand has a right to discovery similar in scope to that granted by Rules 26 to 37 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.First Nat'l Bank v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1977-NMCA-005, 90 N.M. 110, 560 P.2d 174.\n\nAm.

County assessors shall determine values of property for property taxation purposes in accordance with the Property Tax Code and the regulations, orders, rulings and instructions of the department. Except as limited in Section 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978, they shall also implement a program of updating property values so that current and correct values of property are maintained and shall have sole responsibility and authority at the county level for property valuation maintenance, subject only to the general supervisory powers of the director.\n\nB. The director shall implement a program of regular evaluation of county assessors' valuation activities with particular emphasis on the maintenance of current and correct values.\n\nC. Upon request of the county assessor, the director may contract with a board of county commissioners for the department to assume all or part of the responsibilities, functions and authority of a county assessor to establish or operate a property valuation maintenance program in the county. The contract shall be in writing and shall include provisions for the sharing of the program costs between the county and the department. The contract must include specific descriptions of the objectives to be reached and the tasks to be performed by the contracting parties. The initial term of any contract authorized under this subsection shall not extend beyond the end of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which it is executed, but contracts may be renewed for additional one-year periods for succeeding years.\n\nD. The department of finance and administration shall not approve the operating budget of any county in which there is not an adequate allocation of funds to the county assessor for the purpose of fulfilling his responsibilities for property valuation maintenance under this section. If the department of finance and administration questions the adequacy of any allocation of funds for this purpose, it shall consult with the department, the board of county commissioners and the county assessor in making its determination of adequacy.\n\nE. To aid the board of county commissioners in determining whether a county assessor is operating an efficient program of property valuation maintenance and in determining the amount to be allocated to him for this function, the county assessor shall present with his annual budget request a written report setting forth improvements of property added to valuation records during the year, additions of new property to valuation records during the year, increases and decreases of valuation during the year, the relationship of sales prices of property sold to values of the property for property taxation purposes and the current status of the overall property valuation maintenance program in the county. The county assessor shall send a copy of this report to the department.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-29-6, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 18; 2000, ch. 10, § 1.\n\nThe 2000 amendment,effective May 17, 2000 inserted \"Except as limited in Section 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978\" at the beginning of the second sentence in Subsection A and substituted \"shall present\" for \"must present\" in the first sentence in Subsection E.\n\nReappraisal of all comparable properties in same year not required.— Section 72-2-21.1, (since repealed) 1953 Comp., et seq., did not require that reappraisal of all comparable properties within each county be completed within the same year.In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70,rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142 (decided under prior law).\n\nDuty of assessor to view property.— It is the duty of the assessor to make a reasonable and diligent effort to view the property in order to see that the property is adequately valued.Bloch Pitt Invs. v. Assessor of Bernalillo Cnty., 86 N.M. 589, 526 P.2d 183 (1974).\n\nValue is a matter of opinion,and, when the law has provided officers upon whom the duty is imposed to make the valuation, it is the opinion of those officers to which the interests of the parties are referred. The court cannot sit in judgment upon their errors, or substitute its own opinion for the conclusions the officers of the law have reached.In re 1971 Assessment of Trinchera Ranch, 1973-NMSC-094, 85 N.M. 557, 514 P.2d 608.\n\nNotice as to amount of taxation is essential due process requirementin the collection of property taxes.In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.\n\nCounty property valuation fund.— In creating the county property valuation fund in 7-38-38.1C NMSA 1978, the legislature created a permanent source of additional revenue to assist county assessors in fulfilling their statutory obligations to maintain current and correct values of all property within their jurisdictions, and directed county assessors to use those funds to achieve fair and timely reappraisal programs. The legislation does not impose any restrictions on the use of the funds other than the use be part of a property valuation program presented by the county assessor and approved by the county commission.Robinson v. Board of Comm'rs of the Cty. of Eddy, 2015-NMSC-035.\n\nWhere the Eddy county assessor sought to use funds from the county property valuation fund, 7-38-38.1C NMSA 1978, to contract with a private company for technical assistance in locating and valuing oil and gas property within Eddy county, the Eddy county commission was not prohibited from approving a contract with an independent contractor to assist the county assessor in valuing property, because the legislature, in creating the county property valuation fund, made no attempt to restrict an assessor's discretion on the use of the fund and thus intended to leave it to the professional discretion of county assessors to decide how best to achieve the statutory goal of current and correct valuation of all property within the county.Robinson v. Board of Comm'rs of the Cty. of Eddy, 2015-NMSC-035.",

      "text": "A. The value of land used primarily for agricultural purposes shall be determined on the basis of the land's capacity to produce agricultural products. Evidence of bona fide primary agricultural use of land for the tax year preceding the year for which determination is made of eligibility for the land to be valued under this section creates a presumption that the land is used primarily for agricultural purposes during the tax year in which the determination is made. If the land was valued under this section in one or more of the three tax years preceding the year in which the determination is made and the use of the land has not changed since the most recent valuation under this section, a presumption is created that the land continues to be entitled to that valuation.\n\nB. For the purpose of this section:\n\n(1) \"agricultural products\" means plants, crops, trees, forest products, orchard crops, livestock, poultry, captive deer or elk, or fish; and\n\n(2) \"agricultural use\" means the:\n\n(a) use of land for the production of agricultural products;\n\n(b) use of land that meets the requirements for payment or other compensation pursuant to a soil conservation program under an agreement with an agency of the federal government;\n\n(c) resting of land to maintain its capacity to produce agricultural products; or\n\n(d) resting of land as the direct result of at least moderate drought conditions as designated by the United States department of agriculture, if the drought conditions occurred in the county within which the land is located for at least eight consecutive weeks during the previous tax year; provided that the land was used in the tax year immediately preceding the previous tax year primarily for a purpose identified pursuant to this paragraph.\n\nC. The department shall adopt rules for determining whether land is used primarily for agricultural purposes. The rules shall provide that the use of land for the lawful taking of game shall not be considered in determining whether land is used primarily for agricultural purposes.\n\nD. The department shall adopt rules for determining the value of land used primarily for agricultural purposes. The rules shall:\n\n(1) specify procedures to use in determining the capacity of land to produce agricultural products and the derivation of value of the land based upon its production capacity;\n\n(2) establish carrying capacity as the measurement of the production capacity of land used for grazing purposes, develop a system of determining carrying capacity through the use of an animal unit concept and establish carrying capacities for the land in the state classified as grazing land;\n\n(3) provide that land the bona fide and primary use of which is the production of captive deer or elk shall be valued as grazing land and that captive deer shall be valued and taxed as sheep and captive elk shall be valued and taxed as cattle;\n\n(4) provide for the consideration of determinations of any other governmental agency concerning the capacity of the same or similar lands to produce agricultural products;\n\n(5) assure that land determined under the rules to have the same or similar production capacity shall be valued uniformly throughout the state; and\n\n(6) provide for the periodic review by the department of determined production capacities and capitalization rates used for determining annually the value of land used primarily for agricultural purposes.\n\nE. All improvements, other than those specified in Section 7-36-15 NMSA 1978, on land used primarily for agricultural purposes shall be valued separately for property taxation purposes, and the value of these improvements shall be added to the value of the land determined under this section.\n\nF. The owner of the land shall make application to the county assessor in a tax year in which the valuation method of this section is first claimed to be applicable to the land or in a tax year immediately subsequent to a tax year in which the land was not valued under this section. Application shall be made under oath, shall be in a form and contain the information required by department rules and shall be made no later than thirty days after the date of mailing by the assessor of the notice of valuation. Once land is valued under this section, application need not be made in subsequent tax years as long as there is no change in the use of the land.\n\nG. The owner of land valued under this section shall report to the county assessor whenever the use of the land changes so that it is no longer being used primarily for agricultural purposes. This report shall be made on a form prescribed by department rules and shall be made by the last day of February of the tax year immediately following the year in which the change in the use of the land occurs.\n\nH. Any person who is required to make a report under the provisions of Subsection G of this section and who fails to do so is personally liable for a civil penalty in an amount equal to the greater of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) or twenty-five percent of the difference between the property taxes ultimately determined to be due and the property taxes originally paid for the tax years for which the person failed to make the required report.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-29-9, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 21; 1975, ch. 165, § 3; 1997, ch. 162, § 1; 2005, ch. 231, § 1; 2013, ch. 219, § 1; 2015, ch. 92, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For agriculture generally,seeChapter 76 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective June 19, 2015, defined \"agricultural products\" and expanded the definition of \"agricultural use\" for property taxes; in Subsection B, added Paragraph (1); redesignated the remainder of Subsection B as Paragraph (2); in Subsection B, Paragraph (2), after \"'agricultural use' means the\", added the designation Subsection B, Paragraph (2)(a); after \"use of land for the production of\", deleted \"plants, crops, trees, forest products, orchard crops, livestock, poultry, captive deer or elk, or fish. The term also includes the\" and added \"agricultural products\"; added the designation Subsection B, Paragraph (2)(b) to the remaining language of former Subsection B; added Subsection B, Paragraphs (2)(c) and (2)(d); and in Subsection F, after \"owner of the land\", deleted \"must\" and added \"shall\", and after \"department rules and\", deleted \"must\" and added \"shall\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2015, ch. 92, § 2 provided that the provisions of Laws 2015, ch. 92, § 1 apply to the 2016 and subsequent property tax years.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective June 14, 2013, provided that an application to use the valuation method for land used primarily for agricultural purposes be made no later than thirty days after the date of mailing by the assessor of the notice of valuation; and in Subsection F, in the second sentence, after \"and must be made no later than\", deleted \"the last day of February of the tax year\" and added \"thirty days after the date of mailing by the assessor of the notice of valuation\".\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective April 6, 2005, in Subsection B, defined \"agricultural use\" to include production of captive deer or elk; in Subsection C, provided that the rules shall provide that the use of land for lawful taking of game shall not be considered in determining whether land is used primarily for agricultural purposes; and added Subsection D(3) to provide that the rules shall provide that land primarily used for the production of captive deer or elk shall be valued as grazing land, that captive deer shall be valued as sheep and that captive elk shall be valued as cattle.\n\nSaving clauses.— Laws 2005, ch. 231, § 2, provided that nothing in this 2005 act shall affect the authority of the state game commission or the director of the department of game and fish.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,June 20, 1997, rewrote Subsection A; substituted \"7-36-15 NMSA 1978\" for \"72-29-5 NMSA 1953\" in Subsection E; deleted the last sentence in the introductory paragraph of Subsection F; deleted Paragraphs F(1) and (2); deleted the closing paragraph of Subsection F; and added Subsections G and H.\n\nElk herd was not livestockfor purposes of agricultural classification of property, and, although petitioner's agreement with federal government was proper soil conservation agreement, comparisons of income from multiple uses of property was reasonable proxy for determining that agricultural use was not primary.Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rodarte, 2004-NMSC-035, 136 N.M. 630, 103 P.3d 554,rev'g2004-NMCA-055, 135 N.M. 630, 92 P.3d 642.\n\nDistinction between subdivided agricultural lands not unconstitutional.— Distinction drawn by 72-2-14.1, 1953 Comp., between subdivided and unsubdivided agricultural land, for tax purposes, did not offend N.M. Const., art. VIII, § 1 and did not violate due process.Property Appraisal Dep't v. Ransom, 1973-NMCA-015, 84 N.M. 637, 506 P.2d 794 (decided under prior law).\n\nThis section establishes special method of valuation for landused primarily for agricultural purposes, determined on the basis of the land's capacity to produce agricultural products. This \"Green Belt\" law is clearly an exception to the general mode of property valuation for tax purposes established by the Property Tax Code and the New Mexico constitution,i.e., market value.County of Bernalillo v. Ambell, 1980-NMSC-062, 94 N.M. 395, 611 P.2d 218.\n\nAgricultural land is to be valued based on its capacity to produce,not on its actual production.Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rio Arriba Cnty. Assessor, 2004-NMCA-055, 135 N.M. 630, 92 P.3d 642,rev'd2004-NMSC-035, 136 N.M. 630, 103 P.3d 554.\n\nLegislative intentbehind this special method of property tax valuation is to aid the small subsistence farmers in the state.County of Bernalillo v. Ambell, 1980-NMSC-062, 94 N.M. 395, 611 P.2d 218.\n\nLegislative intent.— A broad reading of \"agricultural use\" so as to entitle owners of residential, yet pastoral, lands generally to tax relief is inconsistent with the plain language of this section; the section evinces a legislative intent to deny tax relief to those who demonstrate mere passive or incidental cultivation of their lands.Alexander v. Anderson, 1999-NMCA-021, 126 N.M. 632, 973 P.2d 884.\n\nCrops produced for sale or home consumption.— While growing alfalfa, fruits, nuts, and vegetables may constitute producing crops, an applicant for exemption is required to demonstrate an objective intent to produce a crop for sale or home consumption.Alexander v. Anderson, 1999-NMCA-021, 126 N.M. 632, 973 P.2d 884.\n\n\"Home consumption\" construed.— Grazing of recreational horses on taxpayers' property did not satisfy the regulatory provision (3 NMAC 6.5.27.1.1) for \"home consumption.\"Alexander v. Anderson, 1999-NMCA-021, 126 N.M. 632, 973 P.2d 884.\n\nRegulation upheld.— Promulgation of a regulation (3 NMAC 6.5.27.1.1) to implement the \"agricultural use\" exemption of this section is a legal exercise of delegated legislative authority and the regulation is consistent with this section's manifest intent.Alexander v. Anderson, 1999-NMCA-021, 126 N.M. 632, 973 P.2d 884.\n\nComparable sales wrong criteria under this section.— County assessors using comparable sales instead of agricultural purposes were using the wrong criteria for determining tax on grazing land under this section.In re Armijo, 1976-NMCA-032, 89 N.M. 131, 548 P.2d 93.\n\nSpecial valuation not applicable once land changed to nonagricultural use.— Once a property's use has changed from agricultural to nonagricultural, there is no longer the need to give the property owner special tax treatment; the legislature did not desire to give special treatment to former owners of agricultural land even after they voluntarily submit to reclassification of their land for property tax purposes.County of Bernalillo v. Ambell, 1980-NMSC-062, 94 N.M. 395, 611 P.2d 218.\n\nHypothetical or speculative values not basis.— Classification or assessment of property for tax purposes premised upon hypothetical or speculative values believed, ultimately or at some later time, to be or become the true market value of such land cannot legitimately be the basis of determining its value.Gerner v. State Tax Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-022, 71 N.M. 385, 378 P.2d 619.\n\nGrazing land being held for lots.— Classification and valuation of property suitable for grazing purposes at 10 times the valuation of other property of the same character and quality and similarly situated because of its classification as lots held for speculation for oil or other purposes, absent any evidence of such speculative purposes, was so excessive and discriminatory as to entitle taxpayer to relief, despite fact that some other owners of like tracts were similarly assessed or that these lands, while similar to grazing lands, were not actually used for grazing purposes.Gerner v. State Tax Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-022, 71 N.M. 385, 378 P.2d 619.\n\nAm.

All livestock not located in the state on January 1 but brought into the state and located there for more than twenty days subsequent to January 1 shall be valued for property taxation purposes as of the first day of the month following the month in which they have remained in the state for more than twenty days.\n\nC. The owner of livestock subject to valuation for property taxation purposes shall report the livestock for valuation to the county assessor of the county in which they are located on the valuation date specified in Subsections A or B of this section. However, if an importation or movement report is made by the livestock board under the provisions of Section 7-38-45 NMSA 1978, the owner of livestock is relieved of his responsibility to report the livestock covered by the livestock board report, and that report fulfills the owner's responsibility for reporting the livestock under this section. The owner's report shall be in a form and contain the information required by department regulations and shall be made no later than:\n\n(1) the last day of February for livestock required to be valued as of the first day of January or February of the tax year; or\n\n(2) ten days after the valuation date determined under Subsection B of this section for livestock required to be valued as of dates other than those in Paragraph (1) of this subsection.\n\nD. The department shall establish for each tax year the various classes of livestock and the value of each class. This determination shall be implemented by an order of the director, and the order shall be made no later than December 1 of the year prior to the tax year to which the classification and values apply.\n\nE. The department shall adopt regulations for the allocation of value of livestock, which regulations shall provide for:\n\n(1) a basic allocation formula that prorates value on the basis of the amount of time that livestock are in the state and subject to valuation for property taxation purposes;\n\n(2) determining proration of value under Paragraph (1) of this subsection using estimates of the amount of time that livestock will be in the state to cover those situations in which livestock are imported for an indeterminate time during a tax year or in which resident livestock are exported for an indeterminate time during a tax year but are returned during the same tax year; and\n\n(3) a method of allocating value of livestock, both resident and transient, among different governmental units when the livestock range on land in more than one governmental unit.\n\nF. Any person who intentionally refuses to make a report required of him under this section or who knowingly makes a false statement in a report required under this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by the imposition of a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).\n\nG. Any person who fails to make a report required of him under this section is liable for a civil penalty in an amount equal to five percent of the property taxes ultimately determined to be due on the property for the tax year or years for which he failed to make the required report.\n\nH.

The civil penalties authorized under Subsections G and H of this section shall be imposed and collected at the time and in the manner that the tax is imposed and collected.

Residential property shall be valued at its current and correct value in accordance with the provisions of the Property Tax Code; provided that for the 2001 and subsequent tax years, the value of a property in any tax year shall not exceed the higher of one hundred three percent of the value in the tax year prior to the tax year in which the property is being valued or one hundred six and one-tenth percent of the value in the tax year two years prior to the tax year in which the property is being valued. This limitation on increases in value does not apply to:\n\n(1) a residential property in the first tax year that it is valued for property taxation purposes;\n\n(2) any physical improvements, except for solar energy system installations, made to the property during the year immediately prior to the tax year or omitted in a prior tax year; or\n\n(3) valuation of a residential property in any tax year in which:\n\n(a) a change of ownership of the property occurred in the year immediately prior to the tax year for which the value of the property for property taxation purposes is being determined; or\n\n(b) the use or zoning of the property has changed in the year prior to the tax year.\n\nB. If a change of ownership of residential property occurred in the year immediately prior to the tax year for which the value of the property for property taxation purposes is being determined, the value of the property shall be its current and correct value as determined pursuant to the general valuation provisions of the Property Tax Code.\n\nC. To assure that the values of residential property for property taxation purposes are at current and correct values in all counties prior to application of the limitation in Subsection A of this section, the department shall determine for the 2000 tax year the sales ratio pursuant to Section 7-36-18 NMSA 1978 or, if a sales ratio cannot be determined pursuant to that section, conduct a sales-ratio analysis using both independent appraisals by the department and sales. If the sales ratio for a county for the 2000 tax year is less than eighty-five, as measured by the median ratio of value for property taxation purposes to sales price or independent appraisal by the department, the county shall not be subject to the limitations of Subsection A of this section and shall conduct a reassessment of residential property in the county so that by the 2003 tax year, the sales ratio is at least eighty-five. After such reassessment, the limitation on increases in valuation in this section shall apply in those counties in the earlier of the 2004 tax year or the first tax year following the tax year that the county has a sales ratio of eighty-five or higher, as measured by the median ratio of value for property taxation purposes to sales value or independent appraisal by the department. Thereafter, the limitation on increases in valuation of residential property for property taxation purposes in this section shall apply to subsequent tax years in all counties.\n\nD. The provisions of this section do not apply to residential property for any tax year in which the property is subject to the valuation limitation in Section 7-36-21.3 NMSA 1978.\n\nE. As used in this section, \"change of ownership\" means a transfer to a transferee by a transferor of all or any part of the transferor's legal or equitable ownership interest in residential property except for a transfer:\n\n(1) to a trustee for the beneficial use of the spouse of the transferor or the surviving spouse of a deceased transferor;\n\n(2) to the spouse of the transferor that takes effect upon the death of the transferor;\n\n(3) that creates, transfers or terminates, solely between spouses, any co-owner's interest;\n\n(4) to a child of the transferor, who occupies the property as that person's principal residence at the time of transfer; provided that the first subsequent tax year in which that person does not qualify for the head of household exemption on that property, a change of ownership shall be deemed to have occurred;\n\n(5) that confirms or corrects a previous transfer made by a document that was recorded in the real estate records of the county in which the real property is located;\n\n(6) for the purpose of quieting the title to real property or resolving a disputed location of a real property boundary;\n\n(7) to a revocable trust by the transferor with the transferor, the transferor's spouse or a child of the transferor as beneficiary; or\n\n(8) from a revocable trust described in Paragraph (7) of this subsection back to the settlor or trustor or to the beneficiaries of the trust.\n\nF. As used in this section, \"solar energy system installation\" means an installation that is used to provide space heat, hot water or electricity to the property in which it is installed and is:\n\n(1) an installation that uses solar panels that are not also windows;\n\n(2) a dark-colored water tank exposed to sunlight; or\n\n(3) a non-vented trombe wall.\n\nHistory:Laws 2000, ch. 10, § 2; 2001, ch. 321, § 1; 2003, ch. 118, § 1; 2010, ch. 30, § 1.\n\nThe 2010 amendment,effective May 19, 2010, in Subsection A(2), added \"except for solar energy system installations,\"; in Subsection E(4), after \"who occupies the property as\", changed \"his\" to \"that person's\"; and added Subsection F.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2010, ch. 30, § 1 provided that the provisions of Laws 2010, ch. 30, § 1 are applicable to property tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2010.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, deleted former Paragraphs (2) and (3) from Subsection E, defining \"net new value\" and \"prior year value\", and redesignated the remaining Paragraphs of Subsection E.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective April 5, 2001, inserted \"or omitted in a prior tax year\" in Paragraph A(2); In Subsection C, substituted the language beginning \"the department shall determine for the 2000 tax year\" to the end of the subsection for that former language that provided for the method of determination if a county was not subject to the limitation in Subsection A; added Subsection D; and redesignated Subsection D as E.\n\nConstitutional valuation limitations.— Article VIII, Section 1 of the New Mexico Constitution limits the legislature's existing plenary authority to impose valuation limitations based on taxpayer characteristics to the three enumerated characteristics of age, income, and owner-occupancy. It does not impose any restrictions on the legislature's authority to impose limitations in valuation increases based on its classification of residential property.Zhao v. Montoya, 2014-NMSC-025,aff'g in part,rev'g in part2012-NMCA-056, 280 P.3d 918.\n\nStatute does not violate the New Mexico Constitution.— Section 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978 does not violate the New Mexico Constitution because it creates an authorized class based on the nature of the property and not on the taxpayer and it does not violate the equal and uniform clause of Article VIII, Section 1 of the New Mexico Constitution because it furthers the legitimate state interest of fostering neighborhood preservation and stability by permitting older owners to pay progressively less taxes than new owners.Zhao v. Montoya, 2014-NMSC-025,aff'g in part,rev'g in part2012-NMCA-056, 280 P.3d 918.\n\nWhere a property owner purchased a residential property in 2007 that had been assessed and valued at $243,786; in 2008 the property was valued at $362,600; another property owner purchased a new home \"around the corner\" from the owner's old home; in 2009, the old home was valued at $553,700 and the new home was valued at $902,500; and the owners claimed that they were entitled to the three percent limitation on increase in valuation that applied to other properties in the area that had not changed ownership, that 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978 was unconstitutional because it created an unauthorized class of residential property taxpayers based solely upon the time of acquisition, not on the constitutionally permissible classifications of owner-occupancy, age or income, and violated the equal and uniform clause of Article VIII, Section 1 of the New Mexico Constitution, 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978 was not unconstitutional because it created an authorized class based on the nature of property and not the taxpayer and because it furthered the legitimate state interest of fostering neighborhood preservation and stability by permitting older owners to pay progressively less taxes than new owners.Zhao v. Montoya, 2014-NMSC-025,aff'g in part,rev'g in part2012-NMCA-056, 280 P.3d 918.\n\nValuation methods did not create a new class of taxpayers.— The different valuation methods under 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978 for newly sold residential property and residential property owned more than a year do not create a new class of taxpayer in violation of Paragraph B of Article VIII, Section 1 of the constitution of New Mexico because 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978 limits revaluation for taxation purposes based on owner-occupant status.Zhao v. Montoya, 2012-NMCA-056, 280 P.3d 918,aff'd in part,rev'd in part, 2014-NMSC-025.\n\nWhere homeowners bought and occupied new homes and in the year following their purchase, the county valued their property at significantly greater amounts for tax purposes than the county had valued the property for the previous owners; as a result of the revaluation, the property tax assessment for the property significantly increased; and the homeowners claimed that 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978 was unconstitutional because it created a new class of taxpayer based on the time of acquisition of property, 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978 did not create a new class of taxpayer because the homeowners did not obtain the benefit of the limitation of increases in assessed value until they purchased the property, at which time, the homeowners became members of the class of owner-occupants to whom the limitation applies.Zhao v. Montoya, 2012-NMCA-056, 280 P.3d 918,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2014-NMSC-025.\n\nChange of ownership.— Where respondents made property transfers between individuals or their trusts and wholly-owned limited liability companies (LLC), the Bernalillo county valuation protest board erred in determining that the transfers did not constitute a change of ownership on the grounds that the property had the same ultimate owner owning the property, because this section expressly carves out eight exceptions to the definition of \"change of ownership,\" none of which includes transfers between individuals or their trusts and LLCs formed to hold title to their properties. A transfer of residential property between an LLC's members and the LLC itself constitutes a change of ownership, subjecting the property to a valuation based upon its current and correct value, regardless of whether the proportional beneficial interests remain intact.Giddings v. SRT-Mountain Vista, LLC, 2019-NMCA-025.",

      "text": "A. The valuation for property taxation purposes of a single-family dwelling owned and occupied by a person who is sixty-five years of age or older or disabled and whose modified gross income for the prior taxable year did not exceed the greater of thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) or the amount calculated pursuant to Subsection F of this section shall not be greater than the assessed valuation of the property for property taxation purposes:\n\n(1) for a person sixty-five years of age or older in the tax year in which the owner qualifies and files an application; or\n\n(2) for a person who is disabled in the tax year in which the owner qualified and files an application for the limitation provided by this section.\n\nB. The limitation provided by this section may be claimed by filing proof of eligibility with the county assessor on an application form furnished by the assessor. The application shall be filed no later than thirty days after the date of mailing by the assessor of the notice of valuation. The application form shall be designed by the department and shall provide for proof of age or disability, occupancy and income eligibility. An owner who applies for the limitation of value specified in this section and files proof of income eligibility for the three consecutive years immediately subsequent to the tax year for which the application is made need not claim the limitation for subsequent tax years if there is no change in eligibility. The county assessor shall apply the limitation automatically in subsequent tax years until a change in eligibility occurs.\n\nC. An owner who has claimed and been allowed the limitation of value specified in this section for the three consecutive tax years immediately prior to the 2020 tax year is not required to claim the limitation for subsequent tax years if there is no change in eligibility, unless the county assessor requests updated information on the owner's modified gross income. The county assessor shall apply the limitation automatically in subsequent tax years until a change in eligibility occurs.\n\nD. A person who has had a limitation applied to a tax year and subsequently becomes ineligible for the limitation because of a change in the person's status or income or a change in the ownership of the property against which the limitation was applied shall notify the county assessor of the loss of eligibility for the limitation by the last day of February of the tax year immediately following the year in which loss of eligibility occurs.\n\nE. A person who knowingly violates the provisions of this section by intentionally claiming and receiving the benefit of a limitation to which the person is not entitled or who fails to comply with the provisions of Subsection D of this section shall be liable for all taxes due, interest and a civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000).\n\nF. For the 2020 tax year and each subsequent tax year, the maximum amount of modified gross income in Subsection A of this section shall be adjusted to account for inflation. The department shall make the adjustment by multiplying thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the consumer price index ending during the prior tax year and the denominator of which is the consumer price index ending in tax year 2019. The result of the multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest one hundred dollars ($100), except that if the result would be an amount less than the corresponding amount for the preceding tax year, then no adjustment shall be made.\n\nG. The department shall publish annually the amount determined by the calculation made pursuant to Subsection F of this section and provide the calculated amount to each county assessor no later than December 1 of each tax year.\n\nH. The limitation of value specified in Subsection A of this section does not apply to:\n\n(1) a change in valuation resulting from any physical improvements made to the property during the year immediately prior to the tax year or a change in the permitted use or zoning of the property during the year immediately prior to the tax year; or\n\n(2) a residential property in the first tax year that is valued for property taxation purposes.\n\nI. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"consumer price index\" means the consumer price index for all urban consumers published by the United States department of labor for the month ending September 30;\n\n(2) \"disabled\" means a person who has been determined to be blind or permanently disabled with medical improvement not expected pursuant to 42 USCA 421 for purposes of the federal Social Security Act or is determined to have a permanent total disability pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act [Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978]; and\n\n(3) \"modified gross income\" means \"modified gross income\" as used in the Income Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 2 NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:Laws 2000, ch. 21, § 1; 2001, ch. 321, § 2; 2003, ch. 78, § 1; 2008, ch. 26, § 1; 2013, ch. 161, § 1; 2019, ch. 140, § 1; 2020, ch. 73, § 1.\n\nThe 2020 amendment,effective May 20, 2020, clarified the limitation on valuation increases for low-income disabled persons; in Subsection A, in the introductory clause, after \"greater than the\", added \"assessed\", in Paragraph A(1), added \"for a person sixty-five years of age or older in the\", and after \"in which the\", deleted \"owner's sixty-fifth birthday occurs, if the owner owns and occupies that property\" and added \"owner qualifies and files an application\", and completely rewrote Paragraph A(2); and in Subsection B, added \"The application shall be filed no later than thirty days after the date of mailing by the assessor of the notice of valuation.\".\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective June 14, 2019, increased the income limit for eligibility for a limitation on property tax valuation of a dwelling occupied by a person who is sixty-five years of age or older or disabled; deleted former Subsections A through D, added a new Subsection A and redesignated former Subsections E through I as Subsections B through F, respectively; in Subsection B, added \"The limitation provided by this section\", and after \"an application form\", deleted \"for the limitation\"; in Subsection C, after \"prior to the\", deleted \"2014\" and added \"2020\", after \"tax year is not\", added \"required to\", and after \"change in eligibility\", added \"unless the county assessor requests updated information on the owner's modified gross income\"; in Subsection E, after \"civil penalty of\", deleted \"no more than three times the amount of additional taxes due\" and added \"one thousand dollars ($1,000)\"; in Subsection F, after \"For the\", deleted \"2002\" and added \"2020\", after \"modified gross income in\", deleted \"Subsections A, B and C\" and added \"Subsection A\", after \"by multiplying\", deleted \"the maximum amount for tax year 2000\" and added \"thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000)\", after \"ending in tax year\", deleted \"2000\" and added \"2019\", and deleted \"for purpose of this subsection, 'consumer price index' means the consumer price index for all urban consumers published by the United States department of labor for the month ending September 30\"; redesignated former Subsections J and K as Subsections H and I, respectively; in Subsection G, after \"calculation\", added \"made pursuant to Subsection F of this section\", and after \"and\", deleted \"distribute it\" and added \"provide the calculated amount\"; in Subsection H, in the introductory clause, after \"specified in\", deleted \"Subsections A, B and C\" and added \"Subsection A\"; and in Subsection I, added Paragraphs I(1) and I(3) and new paragraph designation \"(2)\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2019, ch. 140, § 2 provided that the provisions of Laws 2019, ch. 140, § 1 apply to the 2020 and subsequent property tax years.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective June 14, 2013, provided for an automatic application of the limitation on increase in value for single-family dwellings occupied by low-income owners sixty-five years of age or disabled; provides for penalties; in the title, added \"requirements; penalties\"; deleted former Subsection E, which provided for the application for the limitation of value; and added Subsections E through H.\n\nThe 2008 amendment,effective May 14, 2008, added Subsections B and D.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, in the section heading, substituted \"low-income owners\" for \"owner\" near the middle and added \"or disabled\" at the end; added present Subsection B and redesignated subsequent subsections accordingly; in present Subsection C, substituted \"Subsections A and B\" for \"Subsection A\" near the beginning and inserted \"or disability\" following \"proof of age\" near the end; substituted \"Subsections A and B\" for \"Subsection A\" near the beginning of Subsection D and near the middle of Subsection E; and added present Subsection F.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective April 5, 2001; in Subsection A, substituted \"did not exceed the greater of eighteen thousand dollars ($18,000) or the amount calculated pursuant to Subsection C of this section\" for \"did not exceed eighteen thousand dollars ($18,000)\" added Paragraph A(3); deleted \"at the time notices of valuation are sent out by the assessor pursuant to Section 7-38-20 NMSA 1978\" at the end of the first sentence in Subsection B and added Subsections C and D.",

      "text": "As used in this article, \"mineral property\" does not include oil and gas property or productive copper mineral property and means:\n\nA. \"class one productive mineral property\", which means mineral lands, all mineral reserves and interests in minerals in mineral lands and all severed mineral products from mineral lands when the mineral lands are held under private ownership in fee and the property is mined or operated in good faith for its mineral values with a reasonable degree of continuity during the year preceding the tax year in which its value is determined and to an extent in keeping with the market demand and conditions affecting the extraction and disposition of the product;\n\nB. \"class one nonproductive mineral property\", which means mineral lands, all mineral reserves and interests in minerals in mineral lands and all severed mineral products from mineral lands when the mineral lands are held under private ownership in fee and the property is known to contain minerals in commercially workable quantities of such a character as add present value to the land in addition to its values for other purposes but is not operated so as to fall in the class of class one productive mineral property;\n\nC. \"class two mineral property\", which means the severed mineral products from mineral lands held by possessory title under the laws of the United States; and\n\nD. \"class three mineral property\", which means severed mineral products from leasehold or contract mineral rights in mineral lands, the fee of which is vested in the United States or the state.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-29-11, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 23; 1975, ch. 218, § 2; 1990, ch. 125, § 4.\n\nCross references.— For mines and mining,seeChapter 69 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1990 amendment,effective March 7, 1990, inserted \"for productive copper mineral property\" in the introductory language.\n\nNonseverability.— Laws 1990, ch. 125, § 19 provided that the provisions of the Copper Production Ad Valorem Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 39 NMSA 1978] and the corresponding amendments made in that act to the Property Tax Code [Articles 35 to 38 of Chapter 7 NMSA 1978] are not severable.\n\nNeither supreme court nor district court may reclassify, revalue or reassess propertyimproperly classified by taxing officials and, consequently, assess at an excessive valuation.Gerner v. State Tax Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-022, 71 N.M. 385, 378 P.2d 619.\n\nNegative mineral property production figure disallowed.— The statutory requirement of allocating the net taxable value of each item of property used in connection with mineral property prevents the use of the negative value for mineral property production to reduce the valuation of property valued under Section 7-36-33 NMSA 1978; therefore, the taxpayer cannot use a negative figure for mineral property production to reduce the positive value of property used in connection with mineral property.U.V.

Property Tax Div. of Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-147, 93 N.M. 651, 603 P.2d 1108.\n\nValuation to be fixed by standards.— To have uniformity and equality in a form of tax, the valuations must be established by some standard; and after valuations are fixed, the taxes based upon such valuations must be levied by a standard. It is only thus that each taxpayer may bear his fair share of the burden of government.Gerner v. State Tax Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-022, 71 N.M. 385, 378 P.2d 619.\n\nRegulation based upon taxpayer's federal tax treatment of property.— Regulation providing that, if a taxpayer attributed development expenditures to a particular piece of property under 26 USCS § 616, the property was rebuttably presumed, for the next 10 years, to contain minerals in such quantities and character so as to classify the property as class one nonproductive mineral property under Subsection B, was a valid regulation in that it was not arbitrary because the taxpayer would have opportunity to present facts to rebut the presumption; in that there was substantial evidence to support the regulation; and in that the regulation was not substantive, since it announced a procedure for classifying the property based upon the taxpayer's treatment of the property for federal tax purposes.Santa Fe Pac.R.R. v.

The provisions of this section apply to the valuation of all mineral property and property used in connection with mineral property except potash and uranium mineral property and property used in connection with potash and uranium mineral property, the methods of valuation for which are provided in Sections 7-36-24 and 7-36-25 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. The following kinds of property held or used in connection with mineral property shall be valued under the methods of valuation required by the Property Tax Code:\n\n(1) improvements, equipment, materials, supplies and other personal property held or used in connection with all classes of mineral property; \"improvements\" as used in this section includes surface and subsurface structures, but does not include pits, shafts, drifts and other similar artificial changes in the physical condition of the surface or subsurface of the earth produced solely by the removal or rearrangement of earth or minerals for the purpose of exposing or removing ore from a mine; and\n\n(2) the surface value for agricultural or other purposes of class one productive or nonproductive mineral property when the surface interest is held in the same ownership as the mineral interests.\n\nC. The value for property taxation purposes of class one productive mineral property is an amount equal to three hundred percent of the annual net production value of the mineral property.\n\nD. The value for property taxation purposes of class two and class three mineral property is an amount equal to three hundred percent of the annual net production value.\n\nE. The value for property taxation purposes of class one nonproductive mineral property shall be determined by applying a per acre value to the surface acres of the property being valued. The per acre value of class one nonproductive mineral property shall be determined under regulations adopted by the department, which regulations shall establish a per acre value based upon bonus bids accepted by the commissioner of public lands for the latest one year period in which bonus bids were accepted for the sale of mineral leases, which per acre value may be determined by geographical areas.\n\nF. For purposes of this section, \"annual net production value\" means either:\n\n(1) the average of five years' net production value from the mineral property for the five years immediately preceding the tax year in which value is being determined, or so much of the period during which the property has been in operation, with each year's net production value being determined by taking the year's market value of production of all minerals, including any bonus or subsidy payments, and deducting from that value:\n\n(a) any royalties paid or due the United States, the state or any Indian tribe, Indian pueblo or Indian who is a ward of the United States;\n\n(b) the direct costs, exclusive of depreciation, determined under generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied by the taxpayer, of extracting, milling, treating, reducing, transporting and selling the minerals; and\n\n(c) the costs of depreciation, determined under generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied by the taxpayer, of property actually used in the extracting, milling, treating, reducing and transporting of the minerals; or\n\n(2) the net production value from the mineral property for the year immediately preceding the tax year in which value is being determined, with that year's net production value being determined by taking the year's market value of production of all minerals, including any bonus or subsidy payments, and deducting from that value:\n\n(a) any royalties paid or due the United States, the state or any Indian tribe, Indian pueblo or Indian who is a ward of the United States;\n\n(b) the direct costs, exclusive of depreciation, determined under generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied by the taxpayer, of extracting, milling, treating, reducing, transporting and selling the minerals; and\n\n(c) the cost of depreciation, determined under generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied by the taxpayer, of property actually used in the extracting, milling, treating, reducing and transporting of the minerals.\n\nG. Annual net production value shall be determined under Paragraph (1) of Subsection F of this section unless the taxpayer elects to have it determined under Paragraph (2) of that subsection. To be effective, an election must be exercised by written notification to the department at the time the mineral property is reported to the department for valuation in a tax year. Once an election is exercised, a taxpayer may not change from the elected method without the prior approval of the department.\n\nH. The department shall adopt regulations specifying procedures to be followed under, and the details of, the method for valuation of mineral property specified in this section.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-29-12, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 24; 1975, ch. 165, § 4.\n\nCross references.— For mines and mining,seeChapter 69 NMSA 1978.\n\nFair market valueis theoretically what a willing seller would take and a willing buyer offer.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.\n\nPayments to be included in market value.— Portions of former 72-6-7(6), 1953 Comp., are pertinent as the market value is to include bonus or subsidy payments and there is evidence that the royalty payments fall into that category; however, amounts paid for improvements are not to be included as part of the costs, and depreciation on such improvements should also not be included.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.\n\nMarket price as exchange value.— As to the price between a fictional seller and buyer, the market price of a commodity is the exchange value and it is determined by the demand for it in relation to the supply and is proved, when possible, by actual sales.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.\n\nEssential factors in determining market valueare the existence of a demand and the accessibility of a market. Without a demand a rich natural resource may lie dormant and be commercially valueless. Create an active demand and the same deposit may find a ready market. Similarly, proximity to market may be a determining factor.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.\n\nDetermination of market value of average annual output,less the actual cost, over the period of years involved requires an averaging of the costs.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.\n\nLegislative intentionto authorize deduction must be clearly and unambiguously expressed in the statute.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.\n\nSeparate taxation of severed mineral estates required.— Former New Mexico statutory provisions required the separate taxation of severed mineral estates and the public policy of this state was to tax separately the severed mineral rights from the remainder of the fee when in different ownerships.Kaye v. Cooper Grocery Co., 1957-NMSC-049, 63 N.M. 36, 312 P.2d 798.\n\nEven after conveyance of fractional undivided interestin the minerals, the entire mineral estate should be separately assessed and taxed as a unit.Kaye v. Cooper Grocery Co., 1957-NMSC-049, 63 N.M. 36, 312 P.2d 798.\n\nPartial severance considered complete severance.— For assessment purposes, a partial severance conveyance is to be considered a complete severance of the mineral estate.Kaye v. Cooper Grocery Co., 1957-NMSC-049, 63 N.M. 36, 312 P.2d 798.\n\nDuty of tenant in common to pay entire assessment.— The surface owner who has retained an undivided mineral interest becomes a tenant in common as to the mineral estate with his transferee of an undivided mineral interest, and as tenants in common each had the duty to pay the entire assessment on the mineral estate with a right of contribution against his cotenant for a proportionate part.Kaye v. Cooper Grocery Co., 1957-NMSC-049, 63 N.M. 36, 312 P.2d 798.\n\nOwner of mineral estate will not lose interest through tax sale.— When the entire mineral estate has been conveyed by the surface owner and the mineral deed has been recorded prior to the assessment for the tax year, the owner of the mineral estate will not lose his interest through a tax sale unless the mineral estate has been separately assessed and the sale is had for the purpose of recovering delinquent taxes assessed against the mineral estate.Kaye v. Cooper Grocery Co., 1957-NMSC-049, 63 N.M. 36, 312 P.2d 798.\n\nNegative mineral property production figure disallowed.— The statutory requirement of allocating the net taxable value of each item of property used in connection with mineral property prevents the use of the negative value for mineral property production to reduce the valuation of property valued under Section 7-36-33 NMSA 1978; therefore, the taxpayer cannot use a negative figure for mineral property production to reduce the positive value of property used in connection with mineral property.U.V. Indus., Inc. v. Prop. Tax Div. of Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-147, 93 N.M. 651, 603 P.2d 1108.\n\nRegulation modifying statutory determination of annual net production contrary to section.— Regulation providing that the property tax department would not permit the use of minus figures for a particular year's net production value in calculating the average of five years' net production value was contrary to the provisions of Subsection F because the property tax department had no authority to adopt regulations modifying the statutory provision for determining the annual net production value.Santa Fe Pac.R.R. v. Prop. Tax Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 89 N.M. 446, 553 P.2d 726.\n\nRegulation for geographical variance multiplier set aside.— Regulation providing for the use of a multiplier of 100 and of a quotient derived by dividing the total of the bonus bids by the number of acres leased by competitive bidding within a county was set aside since the provision in Subsection E for geographical variance did not support use of such multiplier because the evidence was that procedures for implementing such a variance had not been developed by property tax department.Santa Fe Pac.R.R. v. Prop. Tax Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 89 N.M. 446, 553 P.2d 726.\n\nBurden of proof was on contestantand was both the burden of producing evidence and the burden of persuasion which was, in this case, where the validity of the state's valuation is in issue, not the burden of showing the correct valuation but to show the state's valuation was erroneous. However, an asserted failure in contestant's burden of persuasion does not require that the court uphold the state's valuation when that valuation is not supported by substantial evidence.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1971-NMCA-131, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.\n\nFinding not supported by evidence inference.— Since the market value of the mine run coal was based on evidence of sales of 4% and 9% of production at $8.50 per ton, this evidence did not support an inference that 96% and 91% of production had a market value of $8.50 per ton absent evidence of a market at that price and, therefore, the finding utilizing a market value of $8.50 per ton for all mine run coal was not supported by substantial evidence.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1971-NMCA-131, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Taxation of the Uranium Industry: An Economic Proposal,\" see 7 N.M.L.

The provisions of this section apply to the valuation of all mineral property and property used in connection with mineral property when the primary production from the mineral property is uranium.\n\nB. The following kinds of property held or used in connection with uranium mineral property shall be valued under the methods of valuation required by the Property Tax Code:\n\n(1) improvements, equipment, materials, supplies and other personal property held or used in connection with all classes of uranium mineral property; \"improvements\" as used in this section includes surface and subsurface structures, but does not include pits, shafts, drifts or other similar artificial changes in the physical condition of the surface or subsurface of the earth produced solely by the removal or rearrangement of earth or minerals for the purpose of exposing or removing ore from a mine; and\n\n(2) the surface value for agricultural or other purposes of class one productive or nonproductive uranium mineral property when the surface interest is held in the same ownership as the mineral interests.\n\nC. The value for property taxation purposes of class one productive, class two and class three uranium mineral property is the annual net production value of the uranium mineral property.\n\nD. The value for property taxation purposes of class one nonproductive uranium mineral property shall be determined under Subsection E of Section 7-36-23 NMSA 1978.\n\nE. For the purposes of this section, the \"annual net production value\" means:\n\n(1) the sales price of uranium-bearing material disposed of as ore or solution, less fifty percent of that sales price as a deduction for the cost of producing and bringing the output to the surface and of transporting and selling it; or\n\n(2) in the case of uranium-bearing material not disposed of as ore or solution but processed or beneficiated (other than by sizing and blending), regardless of the form in which the product is actually disposed of, the value of U3O8 contained in ore or solution determined on the basis of the U3O8 content of the ore or solution at fifty percent of the taxpayer's average unit sales price during the preceding calendar year of U3O8 contained in the concentrate form commonly known as \"yellowcake\" (or if the uranium concentrate has not been sold in the preceding calendar year, at fifty percent of the representative sales price for U3O8 contained in the concentrate form commonly known as \"yellowcake\" at the place and time of processing or beneficiation into that concentrate), plus fifty percent of the representative sales price of all other minerals produced and saved from such uranium-bearing material, less fifty percent of the value as a deduction for the cost of producing and bringing the output to the surface from an underground mine.\n\nF. In determining annual net production value of class two and class three uranium mineral property, a deduction may be taken for royalties paid or due the United States, the state or any Indian tribe, Indian pueblo or Indian who is a ward of the United States, but the deduction allowed by this subsection must be subtracted from one hundred percent of the applicable sales price before applying any other reductions in or deductions from that sales price.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-29-14, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 26; 1975, ch. 165, § 6; 1982, ch. 29, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For severance tax on uranium,see7-26-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor mines and mining,seeChapter 69 NMSA 1978.\n\nSection deemed constitutional.— Since the classification, in Subsection E, distinguishing open-pit mines from underground mines is reasonable and the tax imposed by this section is uniform and equal on all subjects of a class, this section is constitutional.Anaconda Co. v.
