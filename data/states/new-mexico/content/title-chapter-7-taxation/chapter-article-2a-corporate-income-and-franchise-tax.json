      "text": "A. Every taxpayer shall pay estimated corporate income tax to the state of New Mexico during its taxable year if its tax after applicable credits is five thousand dollars ($5,000) or more in the current taxable year. A taxpayer to which this section applies shall calculate estimated tax by one of the following methods:\n\n(1) estimating the amount of tax due, net of any credits, for the current taxable year, provided that the estimated amount is at least eighty percent of the amount determined to be due for the taxable year;\n\n(2) using as the estimate an amount equal to one hundred percent of the tax due for the previous taxable year, if the previous taxable year was a full twelve-month year;\n\n(3) using as the estimate an amount equal to one hundred ten percent of the tax due for the taxable year immediately preceding the previous taxable year, if the taxable year immediately preceding the previous taxable year was a full twelve-month year and the return for the previous taxable year has not been filed and the extended due date for filing that return has not occurred at the time the first installment is due for the taxable year; or\n\n(4) estimating the amount of tax due, net of any credits, for each fiscal quarter of the current taxable year, provided that the estimated amount is at least eighty percent of the amount determined to be due for that quarter.\n\nB. If Subsection A of this section applies, the amount of estimated tax shall be paid in installments as provided in this subsection. Twenty-five percent of the estimated tax calculated under Paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of Subsection A of this section or one hundred percent of the estimated tax calculated under Paragraph (4) of Subsection A of this section is due on or before the following dates: the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the taxable year, the fifteenth day of the sixth month of the taxable year, the fifteenth day of the ninth month of the taxable year and the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year. Application of this subsection to a taxable year that is a fractional part of a year shall be determined by regulation of the secretary.\n\nC. Every taxpayer to which Subsection A of this section applies that fails to pay the estimated tax when due or that makes estimated tax payments during the taxable year that are less than the lesser of eighty percent of the income tax imposed on the taxpayer under the Corporate Income and Franchise Tax Act or the amount required by Paragraph (2), (3) or (4) of Subsection A of this section shall be subject to the interest and penalty provisions of Sections 7-1-67 and 7-1-69 NMSA 1978 on the underpayment.\n\nD. For purposes of this section, the amount of underpayment shall be the excess of the amount of the installment that would be required to be paid if the estimated tax were equal to eighty percent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year or the amount required by Paragraph (2), (3) or (4) of Subsection A of this section or, if no return was filed, eighty percent of the tax for the taxable year for which the estimated tax is due less the amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment.\n\nE. For purposes of this section, the period of underpayment shall run from the date the installment was required to be paid to whichever of the following dates is earlier:\n\n(1) the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the taxable year; or\n\n(2) with respect to any portion of the underpayment, the date on which such portion is paid. For the purposes of this paragraph, a payment of estimated tax on any installment date shall be applied as a payment of any previous underpayment only to the extent such payment exceeds the amount of the installment determined under Subsection D of this section due on such installment date.\n\nF.

An equal amount of the amount of withheld tax shall be deemed paid on each due date for the applicable taxable year unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in which case the amounts withheld shall be deemed payments of estimated tax on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld. The taxpayer may apply the provisions of this subsection separately to amounts withheld under the Withholding Tax Act or the Oil and Gas Proceeds and Pass-Through Entity Withholding Tax Act. Amounts of tax paid by taxpayers pursuant to Section 7-3A-3 NMSA 1978 shall not be deemed a payment of estimated tax.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 7-2A-9.1, enacted by Laws 1986, ch. 5, § 1; 1990, ch. 49, § 13; 1992, ch. 78, § 4; 1995, ch. 11, § 7; 1997, ch. 60, § 1; 2003, ch. 86, § 2; 2003, ch. 295, § 1; 2009, ch. 4, § 1; 2010, ch. 53, § 2.\n\nThe 2010 amendment,effective May 19, 2010, in Subsection F, in the first and third sentences, after \"Oil and Gas Proceeds\", added \"and Pass-Through Entity\"; and added the last sentence.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2010, ch. 53, § 19 provided that the provisions of this act are applicable to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2011.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective February 6, 2009, in Subsection B, provided that the payment date for the first quarterly payment of estimated corporate income tax is the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the taxable year; and in Subsection F, provided that the amount of the tax deducted and withheld under the Withholding Tax Act is a payment of estimated tax and added the last sentence.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2009, ch. 4, § 2, provided that for estimated payments due on or before April 15, 2009, pursuant to Section 7-2A-9.1 NMSA 1978, a taxpayer shall remit at least one-eighth of the annual estimated taxes due for the taxable year in lieu of the one-fourth that is required in that section.

If the sum of all sustainable building tax credits that can be applied to a taxable year for a taxpayer, calculated according to Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection K of this section, exceeds the taxpayer's corporate income tax liability for that taxable year, the excess may be carried forward for a period of up to seven years.\n\nM. A taxpayer that otherwise qualifies and claims a sustainable building tax credit with respect to a sustainable building owned by a partnership or other business association of which the taxpayer is a member may claim a credit only in proportion to that taxpayer's interest in the partnership or association.

A person that is a building owner may apply for a certificate of eligibility for the 2021 sustainable building tax credit from the energy, minerals and natural resources department after the construction, installation or renovation of the sustainable building or installation of energy-conserving products in an existing building is complete. Applications shall be considered in the order received. If the energy, minerals and natural resources department determines that the building owner meets the requirements of this subsection and that the building with respect to which the application is made meets the requirements of this section for a 2021 sustainable building tax credit, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility to the building owner, subject to the limitations in Subsection D of this section. The certificate shall include the rating system certification level awarded to the building, the amount of qualified occupied square footage in the building, a calculation of the maximum amount of 2021 sustainable building tax credit for which the building owner would be eligible, the identification number, date of issuance and the first taxable year that the credit shall be claimed. The energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue rules governing the procedure for administering the provisions of this subsection. If the certification level for the sustainable residential building is awarded on or after January 1, 2022, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility to a building owner that is:\n\n(1) the owner of the sustainable residential building at the time the certification level for the building is awarded; or\n\n(2) the subsequent purchaser of a sustainable residential building with respect to which no tax credit has been previously claimed.\n\nD. Except as provided in Subsection E of this section, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility only if the total amount of 2021 sustainable building tax credits represented by certificates of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to this section and pursuant to the Income Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 2 NMSA 1978] shall not exceed in any calendar year an aggregate amount of:\n\n(1) one million dollars ($1,000,000) with respect to the construction of new sustainable commercial buildings;\n\n(2) two million dollars ($2,000,000) with respect to the construction of new sustainable residential buildings that are not manufactured housing;\n\n(3) two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) with respect to the construction of new sustainable residential buildings that are manufactured housing;\n\n(4) one million dollars ($1,000,000) with respect to the renovation of large commercial buildings; and\n\n(5) two million nine hundred thousand dollars ($2,900,000) with respect to the installation of energy-conserving products in existing commercial buildings pursuant to Paragraph (3) of Subsection B of this section and existing residential buildings pursuant to Paragraph (5) of Subsection B of this section.\n\nE. For any taxable year that the energy, minerals and natural resources department determines that applications for sustainable building tax credits for any type of sustainable building pursuant to Subsection D of this section are less than the aggregate limit for that type of sustainable building for that taxable year, the energy, minerals and natural resources department shall allow the difference between the aggregate limit and the applications to be added to the aggregate limit of another type of sustainable building for which applications exceeded the aggregate limit for that taxable year. Any excess not used in a taxable year shall not be carried forward to subsequent taxable years.\n\nF. Installation of a solar thermal system or a photovoltaic system eligible for the new solar market development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.31 NMSA 1978 shall not be used as a component of qualification for the rating system certification level used in determining eligibility for the 2021 sustainable building tax credit, unless a new solar market development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.31 NMSA 1978 has not been claimed with respect to that system and the building owner and the taxpayer claiming the 2021 sustainable building tax credit certify that such a tax credit will not be claimed with respect to that system.\n\nG. To claim the 2021 sustainable building tax credit, the building owner shall provide to the taxation and revenue department a certificate of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to the requirements of Subsection C of this section and any other information the taxation and revenue department may require.\n\nH. If the approved amount of a 2021 sustainable building tax credit for a taxpayer in a taxable year represented by a document issued pursuant to Subsection C of this section is:\n\n(1) less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), a maximum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) shall be applied against the taxpayer's corporate income tax liability for the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the next three subsequent taxable years as needed depending on the amount of credit; or\n\n(2) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more, increments of twenty-five percent of the total credit amount in each of the four taxable years, including the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the three subsequent taxable years, shall be applied against the taxpayer's corporate income tax liability.\n\nI. If the sum of all 2021 sustainable building tax credits that can be applied to a taxable year for a taxpayer, calculated according to Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection H of this section, exceeds the taxpayer's corporate income tax liability for that taxable year, the excess may be carried forward for a period of up to seven years.\n\nJ. A taxpayer that otherwise qualifies and claims a 2021 sustainable building tax credit with respect to a sustainable building owned by a partnership or other business association of which the taxpayer is a member may claim a credit only in proportion to that taxpayer's interest in the partnership or association. The total credit claimed in the aggregate by all members of the partnership or association with respect to the sustainable building shall not exceed the amount of the credit that could have been claimed by a sole owner of the property.\n\nK. If the requirements of this section have been complied with, the department shall issue to the building owner a document granting a 2021 sustainable building tax credit. The document shall be numbered for identification and declare its date of issuance and the amount of the tax credit allowed pursuant to this section. The document may be submitted by the building owner with that taxpayer's income tax return, if applicable, or may be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred to another taxpayer. The parties to such a transaction shall notify the department of the sale, exchange or transfer within ten days of the sale, exchange or transfer.\n\nL. The department and the energy, minerals and natural resources department shall compile an annual report on the 2021 sustainable building tax credit created pursuant to this section that shall include the number of taxpayers approved to receive the tax credit, the aggregate amount of tax credits approved and any other information necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the tax credit.

A taxpayer that employs a qualified foster youth in New Mexico is eligible for a credit against the taxpayer's tax liability imposed pursuant to the Corporate Income and Franchise Tax Act in an amount up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) of the gross wages paid to each qualified foster youth by the taxpayer during the taxable year for which the return is filed. A taxpayer that employs a qualified foster youth for less than the full taxable year is eligible for a credit amount equal to one thousand dollars ($1,000) multiplied by the fraction of a full year for which the qualified foster youth was employed. The tax credit provided by this section may be referred to as the \"foster youth employment corporate income tax credit\".\n\nB. The purpose of the foster youth employment corporate income tax credit is to encourage the employment of individuals who as youth were adjudicated as abused or neglected or who were in the legal custody of the children, youth and families department under the Children's Code [Chapter 32A NMSA 1978] or in the legal custody of a New Mexico Indian nation, tribe or pueblo or the United States department of the interior bureau of Indian affairs division of human services.\n\nC.
