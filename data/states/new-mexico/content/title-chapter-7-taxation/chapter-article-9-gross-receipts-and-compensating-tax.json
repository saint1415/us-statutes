      "text": "Chapter 7, Article 9 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act\".\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-16A-1, enacted by Laws 1966, ch. 47, § 1; 1979, ch. 90, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For the applicability of the Tax Administration Act,see7-1-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the duties with respect to taxation of successors in business,see7-1-61 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor municipal local option gross receipts taxes generally,see7-19D-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor restrictions on municipal taxing power,see3-18-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nContracts of sale or service subject to gross receipts tax.— Taxable incidents are equally apparent and are ascertainable with equal ease whether they arise out of a contract of sale or out of a contract for services, and therefore, equally subject to the New Mexico gross receipts tax.Evco v. Jones, 1971-NMCA-123, 83 N.M. 110, 488 P.2d 1214, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 105, 488 P.2d 1209,rev'd on other grounds, 409 U.S. 91, 93 S. Ct. 349, 34 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1972) (decided under prior law).\n\nPurchasers of property for lease but not lessees subject to gross receipts tax.— Neither the gross receipts tax nor the compensating tax is payable under the law applicable to this appeal by one who leased property for sublease in this state. Such tax, however, is payable by one who has purchased property for lease in this state, thus the legislature has made a distinction with respect to tax liability as between purchasers and lessees.Rust Tractor Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-107, 82 N.M. 82, 475 P.2d 779, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.\n\nGross receipts tax but not use tax applicable to Indians.— The exemption in § 5 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (25 U.S.C. § 465) does not encompass or bar the collection of the state's nondiscriminatory gross receipts tax pursuant to 72-16-1, 1953 Comp. (since repealed). Therefore, a tribal ski enterprise conducted by the tribe with federal funds, on federal lands leased to them, was subject to that tax. However, a compensating or use tax, 72-17-1, 1953 Comp. (since repealed), imposed on personalty installed in ski lift construction was improper under § 5.Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.S. 145, 93 S. Ct. 1267, 36 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1973) (decided under former Section 72-17-1, 1953 Comp.).\n\nIndian trader statutes.— The Indian trader statutes (25 U.S.C. §§ 261 to 264) preempt the imposition of gross receipts tax of this Article on receipts for non-Indian services rendered to an Indian tribal entity on the reservation.N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't v. Laguna Indus., Inc., 1993-NMSC-025, 115 N.M. 553, 855 P.2d 127.\n\nLessee's activity on tax-exempt Indian land subject to gross receipts tax.Norvell v. Sangre de Cristo Dev. Co., 372 F. Supp. 348 (D.N.M. 1974),rev'd on other grounds, 519 F.2d 370 (10th Cir. 1975).\n\nBurden on taxpayer to show rate erroneous.— When government contractor appeals the assessment of a gross receipts tax, penalty and interest, he has the burden of showing the assessment at a higher tax rate established by the 1969 Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act rather than a lower rate under a pre-1969 tax act was erroneous.Martinez v. Jones, 1972-NMCA-054, 83 N.M. 722, 497 P.2d 233, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 741, 497 P.2d 743.\n\nRegulation attacked only if taxpayer's contract properly subject thereunder.— When party, in addition to appealing the assessment of a gross receipts tax, penalty and interest, is attacking validity of regulation governing registration of contracts for purpose of determining gross receipts and compensating tax rate, and party neither offers in evidence his contract with the state highway department, nor does he prove the essential provisions of the contract, the question of the validity of the system of registration is premature until it is shown that the contract could be properly registered under the regulation.Martinez v. Jones, 1972-NMCA-054, 83 N.M. 722, 497 P.2d 233, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 741, 497 P.2d 743.\n\nElectrical energy tax invalid.— Because 7-9-80 NMSA 1978 (since repealed) insured that locally consumed electricity is subject to no tax burden from the electrical energy tax, while electricity generated in this state but sold outside the state is subject to a 2% tax, the tax itself indirectly but necessarily discriminates against electricity sold outside New Mexico; it thus violates a federal statute, 15 U.S.C. § 391, and is invalid under the supremacy clause of the United States constitution.Arizona Pub. Serv. Co. v. Snead, 441 U.S. 141, 99 S. Ct. 1629, 60 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1979).\n\nFederal statute invalidating energy tax constitutional.— A federal statute, 15 U.S.C. § 391, which invalidates the New Mexico electric energy tax, does not exceed the permissible bounds of congressional action under the commerce clause of the United States constitution since congress had a rational basis for finding that the tax interfered with interstate commerce and selected a reasonable method to eliminate that interference.Arizona Pub. Serv. Co. v. Snead, 441 U.S. 141, 99 S. Ct. 1629, 60 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1979).\n\nTax exemptions and deductions not unconstitutional donations unless retroactive.— Gross receipts tax exemptions and deductions do not violate the antidonation clause of the N.M. Const., art. IX, § 14 unless they are applied retroactively to taxes due and payable. 1991 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 91-14.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Ad Valorem Tax Status of a Private Lessee's Interest in Publicly Owned Property: Taxability of Possessory Interests in Industrial Projects under the New Mexico Industrial Revenue Bond Act,\" see 3 N.M.L.

      "text": "The purpose of the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act is to provide revenue for public purposes by levying a tax on the privilege of engaging in certain activities within New Mexico and to protect New Mexico businessmen from the unfair competition that would otherwise result from the importation into the state of property without payment of a similar tax.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-16A-2, enacted by Laws 1966, ch. 47, § 2.\n\nGross receipts tax is a tax upon seller.Mescalero Apache Tribe v. O'Cheskey, 439 F. Supp. 1063 (D.N.M. 1977),aff'd, 625 F.2d 967 (10th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 959, 101 S. Ct. 1417, 67 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1981),reh'g denied, 455 U.S. 929, 102 S. Ct. 1296, 71 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1982).\n\nTax is measured on gross rather than net proceeds.This act taxes the privilege of conducting business in New Mexico, whether profitable or not.United States v. New Mexico, 624 F.2d 111 (10th Cir. 1980),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nGross receipts and income taxes inapplicable to Indian activities within reservation.— New Mexico may not tax income and gross receipts of Indians residing on a reservation when the income and gross receipts involved are derived solely from activities within the reservation.Hunt v. O'Cheskey, 1973-NMCA-026, 85 N.M. 381, 512 P.2d 954, cert. quashed, 85 N.M. 388, 512 P.2d 961.\n\nGross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act is generaland contains no obvious legislative intent to repeal the special \"in lieu of \" provision of Section 60-1-15 NMSA 1978 concerning horse racing licenses.Santa Fe Downs, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-064, 85 N.M. 115, 509 P.2d 882.\n\nGross receipts tax and compensating tax not double taxation.— Since the gross receipts tax and compensating tax were not imposed upon a single transaction, as appellant contended, but upon different taxable incidents; namely, (1) the use of property in this state, such use being leasing or renting it to others (compensating or use tax) and (2) the receipts derived from the payment of rental by those to whom the property was leased (gross receipts or sales tax), then imposition of both taxes did not constitute double taxation on an identical transaction and was not prohibited.Rust Tractor Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-107, 82 N.M. 82, 475 P.2d 779, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.\n\nExemption from gross receipts tax also exemption from compensating tax.— The legislature intended to make the gross receipts tax and compensating tax correlate: an exemption from the gross receipts tax must also be treated as an exemption from the compensating tax.Western Elec. Co. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-047, 90 N.M. 164, 561 P.2d 26.\n\nReceipts from horse races not exempt.— The legislature, in enacting the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act, did not intend to exempt receipts from horse races. There is neither ambiguity nor doubt that the language used in the Gross Receipts Tax Act applies to the receipts of a horse owner paid to him for a winning purse and the receipts of a horse trainer paid to him as his percentage of a winning purse.Till v. Jones, 1972-NMCA-046, 83 N.M. 743, 497 P.2d 745, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 740, 497 P.2d 742.SeeSection 7-9-40 NMSA 1978, which now exempts receipts from horse race purses.\n\nDeductions strictly construed against taxpayer.— The avowed purpose of the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act is to provide revenue, and any deductions must receive strict construction in favor of the taxing authority.Reed v. Jones, 1970-NMCA-050, 81 N.M. 481, 468 P.2d 882.\n\nBurden on taxpayer to establish deduction.— The burden is on the taxpayer to establish clearly his right to the deduction, and the intention to authorize the deduction claimed by the taxpayer must be clearly and unambiguously expressed in the statute.Reed v. Jones, 1970-NMCA-050, 81 N.M. 481, 468 P.2d 882.\n\nImplied rational basis.— Because regulations exempted broadcasting advertisement displayers in New Mexico from the tax imposed upon taxpayer (operator of a billboard service), there was discrimination in the treatment of these different media forms, but the burden was upon the taxpayer to negative every conceivable basis which might support the discriminatory classification, because of the implied rational basis underlying every tax statute, i.e., that the state has the right, power and duty to raise the necessary funds for its public purposes, and it was held that there was a rational basis for the state to discriminate between the broadcast industry and the outdoor advertising industry in the taxation of displays of national messages.Markham Adver. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-071, 88 N.M. 176, 538 P.2d 1198, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"New Mexico's Effort at Rational Taxation of Hard-Minerals Extraction,\" see 10 Nat.

Commissioner of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-129, 83 N.M. 152, 489 P.2d 660, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 151, 489 P.2d 659.\n\nLegal incidence of gross receipts tax on seller.— The statutory language defining services places the legal incidence of the gross receipts tax on the seller.United States v.

There is neither ambiguity nor doubt that the language used in the Gross Receipts Tax Act applies to the receipts of a horse owner paid to him for a winning purse and the receipts of a horse trainer paid to him as his percentage of a winning purse.Till v.

BUSINESS.\n\nMeaning of \"business\".— \"Business\" is that which occupies the time, attention and labor of a person for the purpose of livelihood, profit or improvement; that which is a person's concern or intent.

New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978).\n\nII. PROPERTY.\n\nMeaning of \"license\".— As \"license\" is not defined in the statutes, it is accordingly to be given its ordinary meaning unless a different intent is clearly indicated and as \"license\" is defined in terms of \"to accord permission or consent,\" \"allow,\" \"authorize,\" and as \"permission to act,\" the essential element in the creation of a license is the permission or consent of the licensor and this permission need not come from some government authority.N.M.

Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-015, 87 N.M. 259, 531 P.2d 1232.\n\nFranchises.— For purposes of the gross receipts tax act, a franchise is to be treated as a compound or \"bundled\" form of property, which typically includes a license to use the franchiser's trademark and a commitment by the franchiser to perform various services to assist the franchisee in the operation of the franchised business. Services that are required by the franchise agreement and any services provided by the franchiser to police, promote, maintain, or enhance the value of its franchise system, are part of the franchise, and this is so regardless of whether those services are performed in New Mexico or out-of-state.Sonic Indus., Inc. v. State, 2000-NMCA-087, 129 N.M. 657, 11 P.3d 1219,rev'd on other grounds, 2006-NMSC-038, 140 N.M. 212, 141 P.3d 1266.\n\nTelephone communications not tangible personalty.— The decision of the commission that a telephone company which provided a private telephone line to a federal agency was not entitled to the deduction in Section 7-9-54 NMSA 1978 for the sale of tangible personal property was upheld by the appellate court which found a reasonable basis for differentiating between electricity (declared to be tangible personalty at Section 7-9-3J NMSA 1978) and telephone communications.Leaco Rural Tel. Coop., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-076, 86 N.M. 629, 526 P.2d 426.\n\nIII. SERVICES.\n\nAmendment to definition of service changed test from product's value to seller's activity.— The 1976 amendment to the definition of service changed the test for taxation from one focusing on the end product's value to the purchaser to one focusing on the nature of seller's activity; on the seller's relative investment of skills and materials.EG & G, Inc. v.

Commissioner of Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-136, 84 N.M. 314, 502 P.2d 1004 (decided under prior law).\n\nFence not within definition of \"construction\".— Construction of fences does not come within the definition of \"construction\"in that the fencing material sold is not a component part of a construction project.Cardinal Fence Co. v. Commissioner of Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-136, 84 N.M. 314, 502 P.2d 1004 (decided under prior law).\n\nErection of fences not construction.— Since the construction of fences does not come within the definition of \"construction\", fencing material sold with or without setting of the posts did not become a component part of a construction project and receipts from such sales were deductible.Cardinal Fence Co. v. Commissioner of Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-136, 84 N.M. 314, 502 P.2d 1004 (decided under prior law).\n\nNon-Indians performing construction services for tribe subject to tax.— Under the gross receipts tax act, non-Indian contractors involved in the construction of an Indian resort complex are subject to a tax on the gross receipts they received for performing construction services. The legal incidence of the tax falls upon them and not upon the tribe or tribal property. The state is imposing the tax solely on non-Indians who have performed services for the tribe.Mescalero Apache Tribe v. O'Cheskey, 439 F. Supp. 1063 (D.N.M. 1977),aff'd, 625 F.2d 967 (10th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 959, 101 S. Ct. 1417, 67 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1981),reh'g denied, 455 U.S. 929, 102 S. Ct. 1296, 71 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1982).\n\nImposition of tax on tribal organization impermissible.— If the economic burden of the gross receipts tax ultimately falls on a tribal organization, even though the legal incidence of the tax falls on the non-Indian contractor with whom the organization contracted to build an Indian school, the imposition of the tax impermissibly impedes the clearly expressed federal interest in promoting the quality and quantity of educational opportunities for Indians by depleting the funds available for the construction of Indian schools.Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 458 U.S. 832, 102 S. Ct. 3394, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1174 (1982).\n\nFederal regulatory scheme and policy.— The comprehensive federal regulatory scheme and the express federal policy of encouraging tribal self-sufficiency in the area of education preclude the imposition of the state gross receipts tax on the construction of school facilities on tribal lands pursuant to a contract between a tribal organization and a non-Indian contracting firm.Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 458 U.S. 832, 102 S. Ct. 3394, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1174 (1982).\n\nConstruction project includes wide variety of activities.— This section was intended to make sales of construction materials to governmental entities taxable when the materials were to be incorporated into construction projects. Contrary to taxpayer's argument that Regulation GR 51:16 (now 3.2.1.11) establishes a definite test for determining whether an endeavor is a \"construction project,\" this regulation merely states nonexclusive guidelines for determining whether materials constitute a component part of a construction project. Thus, construction projects include the wide variety of activities listed in Subsection C.Arco Materials, Inc. v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-062, 118 N.M. 12, 878 P.2d 330,rev'd on other grounds sub nom.Blaze Constr. Co. v.

      "text": "A. As used in the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act:\n\n(1) \"gross receipts\" means the total amount of money or the value of other consideration received from selling property in New Mexico, from leasing or licensing property employed in New Mexico, from granting a right to use a franchise employed in New Mexico, from selling services performed outside New Mexico, the product of which is initially used in New Mexico, or from performing services in New Mexico. In an exchange in which the money or other consideration received does not represent the value of the property or service exchanged, \"gross receipts\" means the reasonable value of the property or service exchanged;\n\n(2) \"gross receipts\" includes:\n\n(a) any receipts from sales of tangible personal property handled on consignment;\n\n(b) the total commissions or fees derived from the business of buying, selling or promoting the purchase, sale or lease, as an agent or broker on a commission or fee basis, of any property, service, stock, bond or security;\n\n(c) amounts paid by members of any cooperative association or similar organization for sales or leases of personal property or performance of services by such organization;\n\n(d) amounts received from transmitting messages or conversations by persons providing telephone or telegraph services;\n\n(e) amounts received by a New Mexico florist from the sale of flowers, plants or other products that are customarily sold by florists where the sale is made pursuant to orders placed with the New Mexico florist that are filled and delivered outside New Mexico by an out-of-state florist;\n\n(f) the receipts of a home service provider from providing mobile telecommunications services to customers whose place of primary use is in New Mexico if: 1) the mobile telecommunications services originate and terminate in the same state, regardless of where the services originate, terminate or pass through; and 2) the charges for mobile telecommunications services are billed by or for a customer's home service provider and are deemed provided by the home service provider. For the purposes of this section, \"home service provider\", \"mobile telecommunications services\", \"customer\" and \"place of primary use\" have the meanings given in the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act; and\n\n(g) receipts collected by a marketplace provider engaging in business in the state from sales, leases and licenses of tangible personal property, sales of licenses and sales of services or licenses for use of real property that are sourced to this state and are facilitated by the marketplace provider on behalf of marketplace sellers, regardless of whether the marketplace sellers are engaging in business in the state; and\n\n(3) \"gross receipts\" excludes:\n\n(a) cash discounts allowed and taken;\n\n(b) New Mexico gross receipts tax, governmental gross receipts tax, leased vehicle gross receipts tax, and cannabis excise tax payable on transactions for the reporting period;\n\n(c) taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions of any local option gross receipts tax that is payable on transactions for the reporting period;\n\n(d) any gross receipts or sales taxes imposed by an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo; provided that the tax is approved, if approval is required by federal law or regulation, by the secretary of the interior of the United States; and provided further that the gross receipts or sales tax imposed by the Indian nation, tribe or pueblo provides a reciprocal exclusion for gross receipts, sales or gross receipts-based excise taxes imposed by the state or its political subdivisions;\n\n(e) any type of time-price differential;\n\n(f) amounts received solely on behalf of another in a disclosed agency capacity; and\n\n(g) amounts received by a New Mexico florist from the sale of flowers, plants or other products that are customarily sold by florists where the sale is made pursuant to orders placed with an out-of-state florist for filling and delivery in New Mexico by a New Mexico florist.\n\nB. When the sale of property or service is made under any type of charge, conditional or time-sales contract or the leasing of property is made under a leasing contract, the seller or lessor may elect to treat all receipts, excluding any type of time-price differential, under such contracts as gross receipts as and when the payments are actually received. If the seller or lessor transfers the seller's or lessor's interest in any such contract to a third person, the seller or lessor shall pay the gross receipts tax upon the full sale or leasing contract amount, excluding any type of time-price differential.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 7-9-3.5, enacted by Laws 2003, ch. 272, § 3; 2006, ch. 39, § 2; 2007, ch. 339, § 2; 2019, ch. 270, § 26; 2023, ch. 85, § 10.\n\nCross references.— For the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act,see4 U.S.C.S. § 116 et seq.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 2003, ch. 272, § 3 originally enacted this section as 7-9-3.1 NMSA 1978. The section was renumbered by the compiler as 7-9-3.5 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective July 1, 2023, excluded cannabis excise taxes from the definition of \"gross receipts\"; and in Subsection A, Subparagraph A(3)(b), after \"leased vehicle gross receipts tax\", added \"and cannabis excise tax\".\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective July 1, 2019, revised the definition of \"gross receipts\" as used in the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act; and in Subsection A, added Subparagraph A(2)(g).\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, defined \"gross receipts\" to mean receipts from granting a right to use a franchise employed in New Mexico.\n\nThe 2006 amendment,effective July 1, 2006, provided in Paragraph (1) of Subsection A that gross receipts includes consideration received from licensing property employed in New Mexico.\n\nEntities may take medical services tax deduction on behalf of health care practitioner employees.— Where taxpayer, a medical staffing company that had commercial contracts with the department of veterans affairs and the Indian health service, claimed a gross receipts tax deduction for the provision of medical services on behalf of its nurse employees, and where the department of taxation and revenue claimed that the deduction was limited to individual health care practitioners, the administrative hearing officer did not err in concluding that taxpayer satisfied the basic criteria for the deduction, because the regulation implementing NMSA 1978, § 7-9-93 permits an employer entity to take the deduction on behalf of an employee, provided that the entity is not otherwise excluded and the remaining requirements under the statute are satisfied, and in this case, the parties stipulated that taxpayer is not an excluded health care facility under the regulation, and the stipulated facts establish that all the conditions of § 7-9-93 were met.Robison v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-065.\n\nI. IN GENERAL.\n\n\"Gross receipts\"means the total amount of money or the value of other considerations received from selling property or from performing services.N.M. Enters., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-125, 86 N.M. 799, 528 P.2d 212.\n\nSelling property in New Mexico.— The gross receipts tax only applies when the selling of property takes place within the borders of New Mexico.Kmart Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2006-NMSC-006, 139 N.M. 172, 131 P.3d 22.\n\nRoyalties received from trademark licenses granted as part of a franchise are subject to gross receipts tax.— Where petitioner entered into a number of franchise agreements with New Mexico businesses which contained a provision to grant to franchisees a limited license to use specific trademarks, and where the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department) determined that the royalty fees for the limited trademark licenses were subject to gross receipts tax, the district court did not err in granting the department's motion for summary judgment, because the definition of \"gross receipts\" includes the total amount of money or the value of other consideration received from granting a right to use a franchise employed in New Mexico, and the trademark licensing provision at issue was central to the overall franchise and should be treated as part of the franchise for purposes of gross receipts, regardless of whether it was separately stated and itemized in the franchise agreement.A&W Rests. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2018-NMCA-069, cert. denied.\n\nSalaries and overhead of federal contractors not tax immune.— As long as federal contractors are separate entities solely responsible for their own employees and internal management, salaries and overhead of those contractors are not obligations of the government, for purposes of tax immunity.United States v. New Mexico, 624 F.2d 111 (10th Cir. 1980),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nCollection agencies gross receipts.— A collection agency does not include the creditor's portion of the proceeds, nor the taxes it collects on behalf of the creditor, in calculating its commission proceeds, i.e., its gross receipts. Rather, a collection agency pays gross receipts tax only on the commission portion of the debt. The total tax imposed on the debt and charged to the debtor is simply the sum of the creditor's tax and the agency's tax.Martinez v. Albuquerque Collection Servs., Inc., 867 F. Supp. 1495 (D.N.M. 1994).\n\nTemporary staffing agencies' gross receipts.— Temporary employee company was not excluded from paying tax on its gross receipts from clients to which it provided temporary staffing services; the receipts were taxable as reimbursements of payroll-related expenditure.MPC Ltd. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMCA-021, 133 N.M. 217, 62 P.3d 308.\n\nII. OUT-OF-STATE.\n\nOnly activities within state taxable.— The validity of the application of the gross receipts tax to general and administrative expense reimbursements depended on whether the tax was laid upon gross receipts derived from the contractors' activities within the borders of the state.United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nWork performed outside the state.— If when they received reimbursements for general and administrative expenses contractors were being reimbursed for work (whether called \"services\" or by any other name) performed outside the state, New Mexico taxing authorities lack authority to tax those transactions.United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nOut-of-state activities incidental to a service performed in New Mexico are subject to gross receipts tax.— Where taxpayer, an employment agency based in Houston, Texas with no physical office in New Mexico, entered into a professional service agreement with chevron, under which it would identify, recruit, screen, and hire individuals as contract workers for chevron and provide payroll services for certain members of a group who worked for chevron in New Mexico, and under which chevron would reimburse taxpayer for the members' compensation and pay taxpayer a markup fee, and where the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department) selected taxpayer for an audit and assessed taxpayer for approximately $350,000 of unpaid gross receipts tax plus interest and penalties, and where an administrative hearing determined that the markup fee was exempt from gross receipts tax because it was received for services performed out of state, the administrative hearing officer erred in determining that the markup fee was exempt from gross receipts tax, because activities incidental to a service performed in New Mexico are subject to gross receipts tax, and although the payroll services in this case were performed out of state, the consumption of those services was by the taxpayer's employees working in New Mexico. Taxpayer's out-of-state activities were incidental to the services the taxpayer performed in New Mexico and were therefore subject to gross receipts tax.Tallbridge Corp. v. N.M. Tax'n and Revenue Dep't, 2024-NMCA-044.\n\nTaxpayer was not a disclosed agent entitled to an exemption of gross receipts tax.— Where taxpayer, an employment agency based in Houston, Texas with no physical office in New Mexico, entered into a professional service agreement with chevron, under which it would identify, recruit, screen, and hire individuals as contract workers for chevron and provide payroll services for certain members of a group who worked for chevron in New Mexico, and under which chevron would reimburse taxpayer for the members' compensation and pay taxpayer a markup fee, and where the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department) selected taxpayer for an audit and assessed taxpayer for approximately $350,000 of unpaid gross receipts tax plus interest and penalties, and where an administrative hearing officer determined that taxpayer failed to establish it was a disclosed agent under 7-9-3.5(A)(3)(f) NMSA 1978 and thus not exempt from paying gross receipts tax on the reimbursement it received from chevron, and where taxpayer argued on appeal that uncontroverted facts establish it was an agent of chevron, the hearing officer did not err in determining that taxpayer failed to establish they were a disclosed agent entitled to an exemption of gross receipts tax, because even if taxpayer was chevron's agent, it failed to affirmatively disclose the agency relationship to the group members. The plain meaning of disclosure\" as used in 7-9-3.5(A)(3)(f) NMSA 1978 requires an act informing third parties of the agency relationship and no such evidence of such an act is present here.Tallbridge Corp. v. N.M. Tax'n and Revenue Dep't, 2024-NMCA-044.\n\nIncome accrues on an out-of-state transaction.— Income which arises from a contract performed within the state but accrues upon a separable out-of-state transaction should be excluded from taxation as not being income arising from contracting within the state.United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nMere accounting device will not avoid tax.— Since all receipts resulted solely from the contractor's activities in the state and the general and administrative expense category appeared merely to be a cost accounting device, the entire amount of the receipts may be taxed by the state.United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nApportionment between in-state and out-of-state activity does not ariseif the tax is levied only upon receipts resulting from the taxpayer's activities in New Mexico.Mountain States Adver., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-058, 89 N.M. 331, 552 P.2d 233, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.\n\nTax on foreign corporation's local business does not offend commerce clause.— Gross receipts tax imposed on foreign corporation was conditioned on the local business of renting equipment located in the state. Therefore, the tax does not constitute an undue burden on interstate commerce but, on the contrary, was a tax on the taxpayers' local and intrastate business of leasing machinery.Besser Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1964-NMSC-169, 74 N.M. 377, 394 P.2d 141 (decided under prior gross receipts law).\n\nTaxing out-of-state sales impermissible.— Tax levied on gross receipts from out-of-state sales of tangible personal property, in the nature of reproducible educational material, is an impermissible burden on commerce.Evco v. Jones, 409 U.S. 91, 93 S. Ct. 349, 34 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1972).\n\nEntire revenue from nonresident's display of signs in state taxable.— Colorado corporation which displayed billboards made in Colorado by Colorado employees and whose only contact with New Mexico was the displaying of signs and using 10% of its cost in maintenance was held subject to this section for its entire revenue and not just its 10% cost of maintenance.Mountain States Adver., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-058, 89 N.M. 331, 552 P.2d 233, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.\n\nOnly value of property entering state taxed.— Where tuition paid by New Mexico residents to a correspondence school based in Illinois covered materials valued at an average cost of $50 per student, and the remainder of the tuition covered the costs of grading, counseling and other services connected with the educational programs, virtually all of which services were performed in Illinois, it was held that only the value of the property entering New Mexico could be taxed as gross receipts of the school.Advance Schs., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMSC-007, 89 N.M. 79, 547 P.2d 562.\n\nAffirmative evidence needed to support use within state.— When the corporation contracted with an out-of-state buyer provided for the corporation to destroy munitions, it was entitled to the gross receipts deduction, and the hearing officer could not properly determine that use or delivery took place within the state without some affirmative evidence in the record to support that conclusion.TPL, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMSC-007, 133 N.M. 447, 64 P.3d 474.\n\nTax applicable to foreign franchisor.— Although franchisor has no payroll, real property, personnel or offices located in this state, it does furnish signs which must be leased or purchased by its dealers, and its sales of tangible property and its granting of exclusive franchises constitute engaging in intrastate business in this state and the franchise fees received therefrom are subject to the gross receipts tax.AAMCO Transmissions v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-092, 93 N.M. 389, 600 P.2d 841, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 205, 598 P.2d 1165. (Superceded by statute,Sonic Indus., Inc. v. State, 2000-NMCA-087, 129 N.M. 657, 11 P.3d 1219.)\n\nApplication of tax to franchise fees.— The imposition of gross receipts tax on franchise fees received from this state's dealers does not violate the due process clause or commerce clause and is proper where the franchisor is in the business of selling franchises, developing and marketing parts, receiving its primary source of income from the sale of franchises, collecting a percentage of franchisee's gross receipts as a lease payment for use of the trademark and trade name and where its leased trademarks and trade names and their businesses are protected by the laws of this state; thus, franchisor is engaged in business in this state.AAMCO Transmissions v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-092, 93 N.M. 389, 600 P.2d 841, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 205, 598 P.2d 1165. (Superceded by statute,Sonic Indus., Inc. v. State, 2000-NMCA-087, 129 N.M. 657, 11 P.3d 1219.)\n\nThe 1991 amendment of Subsection J reclassifying licensing as selling did not alter whatever economic nexus existing between a foreign corporation and commercial activity carried on within New Mexico by its franchisees; therefore, fees paid to the corporation by New Mexico franchisees for the right to operate its restaurants located in New Mexico constituted receipts from selling property in New Mexico and were gross receipts within the meaning of Subsection F.Sonic Indus., Inc. v. State, 2000-NMCA-087, 129 N.M. 657, 11 P.3d 1219,rev'd, 2006-NMSC-038, 140 N.M. 212, 141 P.3d 1266.\n\nTax applicable to foreign corporation.— Although the taxpayer, a Delaware corporation, has no employees or offices located in this state, the taxpayer's most valuable assets, its trade name, trademark and related intangibles, are used in this state, taxpayer's secret formulas and techniques are utilized in this state and its method of business exploits the New Mexico market for taxpayer's benefit, taxpayer is engaged in business in New Mexico for purposes of gross receipts tax.Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co. v. Revenue Div., 1979-NMCA-098, 93 N.M. 301, 599 P.2d 1098 (decided under prior law).\n\nIII. LEASES.\n\nReceipt of money from leasing of property is the incidentwhich gave rise to the imposition of the gross receipts and sales tax.Rust Tractor Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-107, 82 N.M. 82, 475 P.2d 779, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.\n\nProperty lease royalties are \"gross receipts.\"— When a taxpayer is leasing property in this state for which it receives royalties, the royalties are \"gross receipts.\"Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co. v. Revenue Div., 1979-NMCA-098, 93 N.M. 301, 599 P.2d 1098 (decided under prior law).\n\nGross receipts tax levied upon lessor of equipment, not user.Co-Con, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-134, 87 N.M. 118, 529 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232.\n\nTreating transactions as rentals for federal tax implies leasing arrangements.— When a parent corporation and its 100%-owned subsidiary utilized certain items of equipment without regard to which held the legal title thereto, made accounting entries showing the machinery as either \"receivable\" or \"liability,\" as appropriate, and treated the transactions as gross rentals for federal corporate income tax purposes, the intent of the taxpayers was to treat the arrangements as rentals or leases which were subject to gross receipts taxes.Co-Con, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-134, 87 N.M. 118, 529 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232.\n\nEffect of Bingo and Raffle Act [repealed] on lease.— An arrangement between the owner of several properties used as bingo halls and the non-profit organizations who operated the bingo games was a lease and not a license where the organizations were required to pay rent, they were granted exclusive possession of certain facilities on the premises and the use of the facilities at certain times, and the owner could not revoke the agreement at will; although the arrangement was not a typical lease, restrictions in the Bingo and Raffle Act [repealed] accounted for the type of arrangement created and to deny that this was a lease would have made it impossible for bingo operators to enter arrangements that would qualify as leases.Quantum Corp. v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-050, 125 N.M. 49, 956 P.2d 848 (decided under Bingo and Raffle Act, since repealed).\n\nLaundry transactions are leasings.— Since the taxpayer's coin-operated laundry business is used for a consideration by persons other than the owner, the transactions are \"leasings\" as defined in Subsection J and the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction from compensating tax liability for the value of the washers and dryers.Strebeck Props., Inc. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-035, 93 N.M. 262, 599 P.2d 1059.\n\nFranchisor's arrangements with its licenseesfall within definition of \"leasing.\"American Dairy Queen Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-160, 93 N.M. 743, 605 P.2d 251 (decided under prior law).\n\nGranting of license.— The 1991 amendments to this section clearly mandate a departure from treating the granting of a license as a lease to treating the granting of a license as a sale of a license.Kmart Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2006-NMSC-006, 139 N.M. 172, 131 P.3d 22.\n\nShelf-display contract receipts.— Taxpayer's appeal of the hearing officer's decision and order upholding the department's assessments of a gross receipts tax and penalty was improper where she failed to overcome the statutory presumption that all receipts were taxable; the buy-down contract payments were reimbursements to the taxpayer for her sales loss incurred as a result of engaging in the discount promotions and the shelf-display contract receipts were taxable because those contracts bore a much greater resemblance to a license than to the creation and conveyance of an interest in real property that would have constituted a lease.Grogan v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMCA-033, 133 N.M. 354, 62 P.3d 1236, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 413, 63 P.3d 516.\n\nIV. TIME-PRICE DIFFERENTIAL.\n\nTo be taxable must be bargained for before work finished.— In order to be taxable as a \"time-price differential sale,\" the money in question must have been bargained for before the contract work was rendered and the final invoice delivered, and when taxpayer accepted a promissory note secured by a mortgage after it had completed its work, the additional money paid on the note was in the nature of interest and could not be characterized as \"time-price\" for the purposes of this section and therefore the tax as imposed by the bureau was inapplicable.Co-Con, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-134, 87 N.M. 118, 529 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232 (decided under prior law).\n\nTime-price differential sale not taxed if no part of which was gross receipt.— Taxpayer was not liable for state and municipal gross receipts taxes on time-price differential of installment sales contract sold to financial institution since no part of time-price differential was a \"gross receipt\" under the statute chargeable to taxpayer.Davis v. Comm'r of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-129, 83 N.M. 152, 489 P.2d 660, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 151, 489 P.2d 659 (decided prior to the 1972 amendment which changed Subsection F's treatment of time-price differential arrangements).\n\nFees taxable even if not approved by court.— Taxpayer was liable for the gross receipts tax assessed against fees actually received and used by the taxpayer, although the fees had not been approved by the bankruptcy court.Lopez v. N.M. Dep't of Taxation & Revenue, 1997-NMCA-115, 124 N.M. 270, 949 P.2d 284, cert. denied, 124 N.M. 311, 950 P.2d 284.\n\n\"Dealer concessions\"retained from mutual fund transactions fall within the terms \"commissions or fees\" as used in this section.Rauscher, Pierce, Refsnes, Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2002-NMSC-013, 132 N.M. 226, 46 P.3d 687.\n\nNo agency when purchases for others merely incidental to work.— Carpenter was not liable for assessment of gross receipts tax on purchases of materials since he did not receive any commissions or fees, but acted merely as an agent for his customers, and the purchases were merely incidental to his work as a carpenter.Stohr v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-118, 90 N.M. 43, 559 P.2d 420, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 254, 561 P.2d 1347 (1977).\n\nNo agency when purchaser consultant to client-buyers.— When taxpayer, engaged in the business of management consultation, supervision and administration for motels, bought large quantities of tangible personal property at wholesale and sold them to its clients without additional cost or profit, the taxpayer was not a factor, agent or broker for its motel clients and was taxable for the total amount of money received from its sale to the motel clients of the tangible personal property under the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act.N.M. Enters., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-125, 86 N.M. 799, 528 P.2d 212.\n\nTerm \"broker\"as used in this section includes a person selling securities on behalf of others.Rauscher, Pierce, Refsnes, Inc. v.

      "text": "A. For the privilege of engaging in business, an excise tax equal to the following percentages of gross receipts is imposed on any person engaging in business in New Mexico:\n\n(1) prior to July 1, 2023, five percent; and\n\n(2) beginning July 1, 2023, four and seven-eighths percent, except as provided in Subsection C of this section.\n\nB. The tax imposed by this section shall be referred to as the \"gross receipts tax\".\n\nC. If, for any single fiscal year occurring after fiscal year 2025 and prior to fiscal year 2030, gross receipts tax revenues are less than ninety-five percent of the gross receipts tax revenues for the previous fiscal year, as determined by the secretary of finance and administration, the rate of the gross receipts tax shall be five and one-eighth percent beginning on the July 1 following the determination made by the secretary of finance and administration.\n\nD. On or before February 1 of each year, until the rate of the gross receipts tax is adjusted to five and one-eighth percent pursuant to Subsection C of this section, the secretary of finance and administration shall make a determination for the purposes of Subsection C of this section. If the rate of tax is adjusted pursuant to that subsection, the secretary shall certify to the secretary of taxation and revenue that the rate of the gross receipts tax shall be five and one-eighth percent, effective on the following July 1.\n\nE. As used in this section, \"gross receipts tax revenues\" means the net receipts attributable to the gross receipts tax and distributed to the general fund.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-16A-4, enacted by Laws 1966, ch. 47, § 4; 1969, ch. 144, § 2; 1978, ch. 151, § 2; 1981, ch. 37, § 9; 1983, ch. 213, § 15; 1986, ch. 20, § 63; 1990 (1st S.S.), ch. 1, § 2; 2010 (2nd S.S.), ch. 7, § 9; 2022, ch. 47, § 12.\n\nCross references.— For exemptions from the gross receipts tax,see7-9-12 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor deductions from the gross receipts tax,see7-9-45 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective July 1, 2022, reduced the rates of the gross receipts tax, provided for an increase in the gross receipts tax if gross receipts tax revenues decrease, and defined \"gross receipts tax revenues\"; in Subsection A, after \"tax equal to\", deleted \"five and one-eighth percent\" and added \"the following percentages\", and added Paragraphs A(1) and A(2); and added Subsections C through E.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2020 (1st S.S.), ch. 4, § 4, effective June 29, 2020, provided:\n\nA. Notwithstanding Sections 7-1-67 and 7-1-69 NMSA 1978, no interest shall accrue and no penalty shall be assessed to a taxpayer for:\n\n(1) tax liabilities pursuant to the Income Tax Act or the Corporate Income and Franchise Tax Act for failure to pay the tax that became due April 15, 2020 through July 15, 2020; provided that the failure to pay the tax was made without intent to evade or defeat the tax; and provided further that payment for the unpaid payments is made in full on or before April 15, 2021;\n\n(2) tax liabilities pursuant to the Withholding Tax Act for failure to pay the tax that became due March 25, 2020 through July 25, 2020; provided that the failure to pay the tax was made without intent to evade or defeat the tax; and provided further that payment for the unpaid taxes is made in full on or before April 25, 2021;\n\n(3) gross receipts tax, local option gross receipts tax or compensating tax liabilities for failure to pay any of those taxes that became due March 25, 2020 through July 25, 2020; provided that the failure to pay the tax was made without intent to evade or defeat the tax; and provided further that payment for the unpaid taxes is made in full on or before April 25, 2021; and\n\n(4) tax liabilities assessed between September 3, 2019 and January 3, 2020 as the result of a managed audit performed in accordance with a managed audit agreement pursuant to Section 7-1-11.1 NMSA 1978; provided that payment for those liabilities is made pursuant to terms of the managed audit agreement on or before December 31, 2020.\n\nB. Notwithstanding Sections 7-38-49 and 7-38-50 NMSA 1978, no interest shall accrue and no penalty shall be assessed to a property owner for unpaid property taxes that became due April 10, 2020 pursuant to Section 7-38-38 NMSA 1978; provided that:\n\n(1) the unpaid property taxes did not become delinquent because of an intent to defraud by the property owner;\n\n(2) payment for the unpaid property taxes is made in full on or before May 10, 2021; and\n\n(3) the subject property does not have property taxes that became delinquent pursuant to Section 7-38-46 NMSA 1978 prior to May 10, 2020.\n\nThe 2010 (2nd S.S.) amendment,effective July 1, 2010, in Subsection A, after \"excise tax equal to five\", added \"and one-eighth\".\n\nThe 1990 amendment,effective July 1, 1990, substituted \"five percent\" for \"four and three-fourths percent\" in Subsection A.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nReasonable tax classifications not unconstitutional.— It is for the legislature to adopt classifications for the imposition of excise taxes as it may deem proper and any reasonable classification cannot be held to deny equal protection or due process.Edmunds v. Bureau of Revenue, 1958-NMSC-112, 64 N.M. 454, 330 P.2d 131.\n\nLegislature's method of imposing gross receipts and compensating tax reasonable.— The legislature's selection of the vendor for imposition of the school tax (gross receipts tax since repealed) and of the purchaser for imposition of the former compensating tax was reasonable in view of the impossibility of subjecting a nonresident vendor - one who was out of the territorial jurisdiction of the legislature - to the school tax.Edmunds v. Bureau of Revenue, 1958-NMSC-112, 64 N.M. 454, 330 P.2d 131.\n\nLegislative failure to protect resident-vendor not unconstitutional.— The failure of the legislature to protect resident-vendor against the unfair competition of importations into New Mexico, without the payment of a sales tax, of chemical reagents did not offend the constitutions of either the United States or of New Mexico so as to invalidate the school tax against him.Edmunds v. Bureau of Revenue, 1958-NMSC-112, 64 N.M. 454, 330 P.2d 131 (decided under former law).\n\nStandard of review on appeal.— Department's gross receipts tax assessment can only be reversed by the court of appeals if arbitrary or capricious, or there is an abuse of discretion, such that the assessment is not supported by substantial evidence or it is otherwise not in accordance with law.ITT Educ. Serv. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-078, 125 N.M. 244, 959 P.2d 969.\n\nDepartment not precluded from assessing taxes where taxpayers failed to establish the elements of collateral estoppel, corporation by estoppel, or judicial estoppel.— Where taxpayers appealed a 2018 assessment of taxes for the 2011 tax year, arising from the operation of an automotive technician business, and where defendant argued that the taxation and revenue department (Department) was precluded on estoppel grounds from personally assessing unpaid 2011 gross receipts tax against taxpayers, the Department was not precluded from assessing unpaid gross receipts tax against taxpayers personally, because taxpayers failed to establish the elements of collateral estoppel, failed to demonstrate that corporation by estoppel applied to the facts of the case, and failed to establish any evidence that warranted applying judicial estoppel.Vigil v. N.M. Tax'n and Revenue Dep't, 2022-NMCA-032.\n\nThe evidence supports the department's personal assessment against taxpayer for business's tax liability.— Where taxpayer appealed a 2018 assessment of taxes for the 2011 tax year, arising from the operation of an automotive technician business, and where defendant argued that taxpayer was not personally liable for gross receipts taxes owed by the business, contending that he did not participate in the operations of the business, the hearing officer did not err in determining that taxpayer held himself out as a corporation, and was therefore personally liable for the business's tax debt, because taxpayer contributed money to the business, was an initial director and incorporator, remained a director and incorporator until 2011, when the business filed articles of incorporation for the second time, signed financing statements and purchased and registered vehicles for the business, taxpayer's credit was used by the business, and taxpayer made payments for property and equipment and guaranteed loans. Taxpayer's course of conduct in relation to the business reasonably demonstrated that he assumed to act as a corporation, and § 53-18-9 NMSA 1978, provides that all persons who assume to act as a corporation without authority to do so are jointly and severally liable for all debts and liabilities incurred or arising as a result thereof.Vigil v. N.M. Tax'n and Revenue Dep't, 2022-NMCA-032.\n\nII. APPLICABILITY.\n\nOnly a person engaging in business may be liable for gross receipts tax.— Under the plain language of this section, the taxation and revenue department may only impose gross receipts tax upon persons who were engaging in business when the tax liability was incurred.New Mexico Depo v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2021-NMCA-011.\n\nDepartment lacked authority to impose tax liability against taxpayer who was not engaged in business at the time the tax liability was incurred.— Where in 2009, taxpayer established a business that provided court reporting services, registered with the taxation and revenue department (department), was assigned a Combined Reporting System (CRS) number for tax reporting purposes, and operated the business as a sole proprietorship from 2009 to 2012, at which time taxpayer converted the business to a limited liability company (LLC), and where taxpayer failed to update the business's registration with the department and continued to operate under the original CRS number assigned to the sole proprietorship, and where the department's computerized auditing system detected a mismatch between the information taxpayer reported to the IRS and the information taxpayer reported to the department, resulting in the department updating the computerized records to reflect that taxpayer's business was operating as an LLC, but failing to issue taxpayer a new CRS number, and where, in 2017, the department issued a notice of assessment of taxes and demand for payment for gross receipts tax from taxpayer as the sole proprietor of the business for the 2012 tax year, and where the hearing officer denied taxpayer's protest finding that the sole proprietorship was obligated for the assessment because at the time the tax liability was incurred, the CRS number on file with the department was assigned to taxpayer, as the sole proprietor of the business, rather than as an LLC, the hearing officer erred in denying taxpayer's protest because to the extent the hearing officer's decision imposed liability against taxpayer for failing to register with the department, it is not in accordance with this section, which permits only the person engaging in business to be taxed, and the overwhelming evidence demonstrated that the business was operating as an LLC during the taxable period. Moreover, neither the registration statute, NMSA 1978 § 7-1-12, nor the department's regulations permit the department to impose liability against a taxpayer based solely on its failure to update its registrations.New Mexico Depo v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't,2021-NMCA-011.\n\nLegal incidence of gross receipts tax on seller.— The statutory language of 7-9-3F NMSA 1978 and this section places the legal incidence of the gross receipts tax on the seller.United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nIncidence of tax on contractors selling services to United States.— The legal incidence of the gross receipts tax was on contractors as sellers of services to the United States, not on the federal government.United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nTax valid since contractors not agents of United States.— Since contracts did not authorize contractors to act as agents of the United States in purchasing supplies and materials, application of the gross receipts tax to the contractual transactions for materials and supplies was not unconstitutional.United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nTax valid even though increases government's contract costs.— That the gross receipts tax may increase cost on a contract to the government does not invalidate the tax on the grounds that a state may not directly tax the federal government since its legal incidence falls elsewhere.United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nAgency exemption.— Money received by the taxpayer, a property management company, from the property owner as reimbursement for on-site employee expenses was not taxable as gross receipts, because the taxpayer was an agent for the property owner for the purpose of employing and paying the on-site employees employed at the owners property.Carlsberg Mgt. Co. v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-121, 116 N.M. 247, 861 P.2d 288, butsee7-9-3.5 NMSA 1978, which now excludes from tax receipts received solely on behalf of another in a disclosed agency capacity.\n\nIf bank can pass tax on, it is not real taxpayer.— Since services of maintaining and processing other banks' accounts were not reasonably necessary or incidental to business or functions of national banking association, New Mexico was not prevented by federal law from levying gross receipts tax on association's receipts collected for said services and association could pass tax on to banks for which it performed services and was therefore not the real taxpayer.First Nat'l Bank v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1969-NMCA-090, 80 N.M. 699, 460 P.2d 64, cert. denied, 80 N.M. 707, 460 P.2d 72, appeal dismissed, 397 U.S. 661, 90 S. Ct. 1407, 25 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1970).\n\nGross receipts tax may be constitutionally imposed on contractor doing work on Indian reservationin the state if there is no imposition on the sovereignty of the United States or infringement of the Indian tribe's right to self-government.Tiffany Constr. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1981-NMSC-057, 96 N.M. 296, 629 P.2d 1225.\n\nGross receipts tax upon non-Indians working on reservations valid.— When the gross receipts tax levied upon non-Indians working on state reservations is nondiscriminatory and does not preclude a possible similar tax by a tribe on activities conducted on its reservation, the Indian right to self-government is not impaired and the tax is valid.Mescalero Apache Tribe v. O'Cheskey, 625 F.2d 967 (10th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 959, 101 S. Ct. 1417, 67 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1981),reh'g denied, 455 U.S. 929, 102 S. Ct. 1296, 71 L. Ed. 2d 474; 459 U.S. 1025, 103 S. Ct. 393, 74 L. Ed. 2d 522 (1982).\n\nIf tax ultimately falls on tribal organization.— If the economic burden of the gross receipts tax ultimately falls on a tribal organization, even though the legal incidence of the tax falls on the non-Indian contractor with whom the organization contracted to build an Indian school, the imposition of the tax impermissibly impedes the clearly expressed federal interest in promoting the quality and quantity of educational opportunities for Indians by depleting the funds available for the construction of Indian schools.Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 458 U.S. 832, 102 S. Ct. 3394, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1174 (1982).\n\nFederal regulatory scheme and policy.— The comprehensive federal regulatory scheme and the express federal policy of encouraging tribal self-sufficiency in the area of education preclude the imposition of the state gross receipts tax on the construction of school facilities on tribal lands pursuant to a contract between a tribal organization and a non-Indian contracting firm.Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 458 U.S. 832, 102 S. Ct. 3394, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1174 (1982).\n\nSale of cigarettes to non-Indians on Indian reservation.— Non-Indian did not have a valid agency relationship with an Indian, so as to bar the imposition of gross receipts taxes on the sale of cigarettes to non-Indians on an Indian reservation, since the Indian made no financial contribution to the commencement or operation of the business and all decision-making was in the hands of the taxpayer.Bien Mur Indian Mkt. Ctr., Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1988-NMCA-104, 108 N.M. 355, 772 P.2d 885,rev'd on other grounds, 108 N.M. 228, 770 P.2d 873 (1989).\n\nFederal preemption for services rendered Indians.— District court properly ordered state tax agency to refund gross receipts taxes paid by a private contractor on services performed on an Indian reservation for a corporation owned by an Indian tribe, in light of the fact that the Indian trader statutes, 25 U.S.C. §§ 261-264 preempted the agency's authority to impose such a tax since the federal trader statutes included services under the scope of \"trade\".Laguna Indus., Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1992-NMCA-109, 114 N.M. 644, 845 P.2d 167,aff'd sum nom.N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't v. Laguna Indus., Inc., 1993-NMSC-025, 115 N.M. 553, 855 P.2d 127.\n\nReceipts from horse races not exempt.— The legislature, in enacting the Gross Receipts Tax Act, did not intend to exempt receipts from horse races. There is neither ambiguity nor doubt that the language used in the Gross Receipts Tax Act applies to the receipts of a horse owner paid to him for a winning purse and the receipts of a horse trainer paid to him as his percentage of a winning purse.Till v. Jones, 1972-NMCA-046, 83 N.M. 743, 497 P.2d 745, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 740, 497 P.2d 742.SeeSection 7-9-40 NMSA 1978 which now exempts receipts from horse race purses.\n\nConstruction work incidental to \"severing\" not subject to receipts tax.— The exemption provided by 7-9-35 NMSA 1978 applied since \"severing\" was taking place as the development work was performed and none of taxpayer's work was preliminary to or preparatory for \"severing\"; therefore, receipts from development work, which includes construction, were exempted from the gross receipts tax and taxable under the service tax (resources excise tax) when such construction work was incidental to the \"severing.\"Patten v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-051, 86 N.M. 355, 524 P.2d 527.\n\nPawnbroker's receipts from sales of pawned chattelwere not exempt or deductible from gross receipts tax as the recoupment of principal, interest, and handling charges attendant to the initial loan transaction.Wing Pawn Shop v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1991-NMCA-024, 111 N.M. 735, 809 P.2d 649 (decided on facts existing prior to enactment of Pawnbrokers Act, 56-12-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.)\n\nCollection agencies gross receipts.— A collection agency does not include the creditor's portion of the proceeds, nor the taxes it collects on behalf of the creditor, in calculating its commission proceeds,i.e., its gross receipts. Rather, a collection agency pays gross receipts tax only on the commission portion of the debt. The total tax imposed on the debt and charged to the debtor is simply the sum of the creditor's tax and the agency's tax.Martinez v. Albuquerque Collection Servs., Inc., 867 F. Supp. 1495 (D.N.M. 1994).\n\nNationwide school operating location in state.— Nationwide technical-vocational school operating a location in New Mexico is subject to the gross receipts tax; the taxable base includes tuition receipts from students in New Mexico for curriculum development, financial aid services, and job placement services.ITT Educ. Serv. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-078, 125 N.M. 244, 959 P.2d 969.\n\nFees of management service company.— Fees paid to a hospital management services company as reimbursement for salaries and expenses of management personnel provided by the company were subject to the gross receipts tax.Brim Healthcare, Inc. v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1995-NMCA-055, 119 N.M. 818, 896 P.2d 498 (decided under prior law).\n\nIII. OUT-OF-STATE.\n\nA substantial nexus was created through activities of a sister corporation.— Where taxpayer had no physical presence in New Mexico other than through stores in New Mexico owned by a sister corporation; and the sister corporation promoted taxpayer through sales of gift cards that were redeemable at taxpayer and that displayed taxpayer's web address, shared customer's email addresses with taxpayer, sold memberships in a shared loyalty program that gave customers a discount on purchases from taxpayer, accepted returns from taxpayer's customers in exchange for store credit which policy taxpayer advertised to its customers, and used the parent corporation's trademark which taxpayer also used, the sister corporation's activities in New Mexico on behalf of taxpayer were significantly associated with taxpayer's ability to establish and maintain a market for its sales in New Mexico and were sufficient to create a substantial nexus between taxpayer and New Mexico which permitted New Mexico to impose the gross receipts tax on taxpayer's sales to customers in New Mexico without offending the federal Commerce Clause.N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't v. Barnesandnoble.com, L.L.C., 2013-NMSC-023,aff'g2012-NMCA-063, 283 P.3d 298.\n\nUse of a trademark to establish a market in New Mexico creates a substantial nexus.— Where taxpayer was engaged in the business of selling books online; taxpayer did not own or lease property in New Mexico and did not have retail stores or sales agents or employees in New Mexico; taxpayer's parent corporation had three bookstores in New Mexico that used the parent corporation's trademark; taxpayer used the trademark on its website; and the stores sold gift cards that could be redeemed at the stores or through the taxpayer's website and loyalty program memberships that entitled customers to discounts at the stores or through taxpayer's website, taxpayer's use of shared marketing, name recognition and trademarks established a market for taxpayer in New Mexico which created a substantial nexus between taxpayer and New Mexico sufficient to support the imposition of the gross receipts tax on taxpayer.N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't v.

Revenue Div., 1979-NMCA-098, 93 N.M. 301, 599 P.2d 1098.\n\nTax on items in interstate commerce to be fair and nondiscriminatory.— To be sustained against a claim that a state-imposed tax runs afoul of the commerce clause of the federal constitution, a tax upon items connected with interstate commerce must: (1) be applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state; (2) be fairly apportioned; (3) not discriminate against interstate commerce; and (4) be fairly related to the services provided by the state.Pittsburgh & Midway Coal Mining Co. v. Revenue Div., 1983-NMCA-019, 99 N.M. 545, 660 P.2d 1027, appeal dismissed, 464 U.S. 923, 104 S. Ct. 323, 78 L. Ed. 2d 296 (1983).\n\nNew Mexico may not tax income and gross receipts of Indiansresiding on a reservation when the income and gross receipts involved are derived solely from activities within the reservation.Hunt v. O'Cheskey, 1973-NMSC-068, 85 N.M. 388, 512 P.2d 961.\n\nTax on gross receipts from sales in other states unconstitutional.— Tax levied on the gross receipts from the sales of tangible personal property in another state is an impermissible burden on commerce.Evco v. Jones, 409 U.S. 91, 93 S. Ct. 349, 34 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1972).\n\nPlace services rendered.— To determine whether receipts from services are subject to gross receipts tax, the focus must be on what services the customers are contracting for and where those services are taking place. Simply because activity necessary to complete the services takes place out-of-state does not mean that the services provided are immune from New Mexico's gross receipts tax.Rauscher, Pierce, Refsnes, Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2000-NMCA-065, 129 N.M. 404, 9 P.3d 648,aff'd2002-NMSC-013, 132 N.M. 226, 46 P.3d 687.\n\nTax incurred at point of retail sale.— Where utilities retail their electrical energy through interstate lines only to consumers in Arizona, for that reason they incur no liability to New Mexico for its gross receipts tax, which is incurred at the point of retail sale.Arizona v. New Mexico, 425 U.S. 794, 96 S. Ct. 1845, 48 L. Ed. 2d 376 (1976).\n\nDiscrimination between broadcast and outdoor advertising held rational.— When regulations exempted broadcasting advertisement displayers in New Mexico from the tax imposed upon taxpayer (operator of a billboard service), there was discrimination in the treatment of these different media forms, but the burden was upon the taxpayer to negative every conceivable basis which might support the discriminatory classification, because of the implied rational basis underlying every tax statute,i.e., that the state has the right, power and duty to raise the necessary funds for its public purposes, and it was held that there was a rational basis for the state to discriminate between the broadcast industry and the outdoor advertising industry in the taxation of displays of national messages.Markham Adver. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-071, 88 N.M. 176, 538 P.2d 1198, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nSince broadcasters generally engage in interstate transmission of their messages,and even if broadcasts by smaller stations might not always cross interstate lines, yet the potential exists for radio and television waves to deliver transitory, interstate communications, for this reason, national advertising by local broadcasting stations has long been held exempt from state taxation.Markham Adver. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-071, 88 N.M. 176, 538 P.2d 1198, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nWhile billboard advertising takes place only in state.— Taxpayer's service of posting messages for national companies on billboards located in New Mexico was being taxed for displaying an activity taking place only in this state and not for advertising; thus it was intrastate in character, and the gross receipts tax imposed on it did not constitute an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the federal constitution.Markham Adver. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-071, 88 N.M. 176, 538 P.2d 1198, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nIf multiple taxation shown, tax would likely be unconstitutional.— The activities of taxpayer, situated and performing services (posting billboards) in New Mexico, were not within the taxing authority of any other state, and therefore no multiple taxation was possible; the instant tax could be declared invalid upon a showing by the taxpayer that multiple taxation would be likely to result and would be likely to unduly burden interstate commerce, but neither showing was made, and therefore, no basis was demonstrated upon which a claim of potential multiple taxation as to this taxpayer could be found.Markham Adver. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-071, 88 N.M. 176, 538 P.2d 1198, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nTraffic between states absent in franchise agreement.— If none of the \"activities\" of the franchise agreement are serviced by mail, telephone correspondence or by any employees of taxpayer, no intercourse or traffic between this state and another is found.Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co. v. Revenue Div., 1979-NMCA-098, 93 N.M. 301, 599 P.2d 1098.\n\nTax constitutional on coal sales to out-of-state buyers.— The imposition of gross receipt taxes on proceeds from the sales of coal to out-of-state buyers does not impermissibly interfere with the commerce clause of the federal constitution.Pittsburgh & Midway Coal Mining Co. v. Revenue Div., 1983-NMCA-019, 99 N.M. 545, 660 P.2d 1027, appeal dismissed, 464 U.S. 923, 104 S. Ct. 323, 78 L. Ed. 2d 296.\n\nTax applicable to foreign franchisor.— Because franchisor has no payroll, real property, personnel or offices located in this state, but it does furnish signs which must be leased or purchased by its dealers, its sales of tangible property and its granting of exclusive franchises constitute engaging in intrastate business in this state, and the franchise fees received therefrom are subject to the gross receipts tax.AAMCO Transmissions v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-092, 93 N.M. 389, 600 P.2d 841, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 205, 598 P.2d 1165 (superceded by statute,Sonic Indus., Inc. v. State, 2000-NMCA-087, 129 N.M. 657, 11 P.3d 1219).\n\nTax applicable to franchise fees.— The imposition of gross receipts tax on franchise fees received from this state's dealers does not violate the due process clause or commerce clause and is proper since the franchisor is in the business of selling franchises, developing and marketing parts, receiving its primary source of income from the sale of franchises, collecting a percentage of franchisee's gross receipts as a lease payment for use of the trademark and trade name and where its leased trademarks and trade names and their businesses are protected by the laws of this state; thus, franchisor is engaged in business in this state.AAMCO Transmissions v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-092, 93 N.M. 389, 600 P.2d 841, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 205, 598 P.2d 1165 (superceded by statute,Sonic Indus., Inc. v.

the taxpayer created, printed and prepared catalogues outside New Mexico and mailed the catalogues from outside New Mexico to potential New Mexico customers; and the taxpayer retained the right to determine where and how the catalogues were distributed in New Mexico, the taxpayer's distribution of sales catalogues in New Mexico constituted a use of the catalogues in New Mexico and was subject to the compensating tax.Dell Catalog Sales, L.P. v. Taxation and Revenue Dept., 2009-NMCA-001, 145 N.M. 419, 199 P.3d 863, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-007, cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 1616, 173 L.Ed.2d 1030.\n\nThe use or compensating tax is an excise taxand not an ad valorem tax.Robert E. McKee, Gen. Contractor Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1957-NMSC-082, 63 N.M. 185, 315 P.2d 832 (decided under former law).\n\nAny reasonable tax classification constitutional.— It is for the legislature to adopt classifications for the imposition of excise taxes as it may deem proper and any reasonable classification cannot be held to deny equal protection or due process.Edmunds v. Bureau of Revenue, 1958-NMSC-112, 64 N.M. 454, 330 P.2d 131 (decided under former law).\n\n\"Compensating tax\" and nontaxable transaction certificates.— This section is designed to impose a compensating tax on transactions such as one which initially would have been subject to the gross receipts tax were it not for the delivery of the nontaxable transaction certificates by the buyer of the materials or services pursuant to Sections 7-9-51 or 7-9-52 NMSA 1978.Continental Inn of Albuquerque, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1992-NMCA-030, 113 N.M. 588, 829 P.2d 946.\n\nUse of nontaxable transaction certificates.— The use of nontaxable transaction certificates, not the taking of the deduction, subjects a taxpayer to the compensating tax.Continental Inn of Albuquerque, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1992-NMCA-030, 113 N.M. 588, 829 P.2d 946.\n\nIntangible property not subject to tax.— Laws 1993, Chapter 31, § 2 amended the definition of property in compensating tax provisions so that it does not include intangible property.Kmart Corp. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2006-NMSC-006, 139 N.M. 172, 131 P.3d 22\n\nForeign transaction subject to tax if receipts tax would apply to domestic.— Supreme court, although finding no need to interpret this section in the disposition of the case before it, indicated that this section appeared to impose a compensating or use tax on property acquired out-of-state in an isolated transaction and used in New Mexico only where the transaction would have been subject to a gross receipts tax if the transaction had taken place in New Mexico.Union Cnty. Feedlot, Inc. v. Vigil, 1968-NMCA-088, 79 N.M. 684, 448 P.2d 485.\n\nTax applicable to reimbursements for property used under government contracts.— Application of the compensating tax to reimbursements for property purchased out-of-state and brought into New Mexico for use under government contracts was valid.United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nTransportation costs excluded from sales price when paid by buyer.— Under a regulation promulgated by the bureau (now department), in computing the compensating tax, transportation costs should be excluded from the sales price of the property when paid to the carrier by the buyer. Thus, when, under the sales contract between the taxpayer (manufacturer) and the buyer, an agency relationship existed whereby the taxpayer was authorized to pay transportation charges both on materials sold to the buyer and on materials returned by it for credit or repair, the regulation specifically excluded from the sales price of the property the transportation costs, which were paid to the carrier by the buyer, since the buyer reimbursed the manufacturer for transportation costs.Western Elec. Co. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-047, 90 N.M. 164, 561 P.2d 26.\n\nEffect of buyer's voluntary payment of tax.— A corporation engaged in the business of selling property in New Mexico was liable for payment of the state's gross receipts tax on the receipts of sales. The voluntary payment of compensating tax by the buyer did not relieve the seller of liability for the gross receipts tax otherwise collectible.Proficient Food Co. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1988-NMCA-042, 107 N.M. 392, 758 P.2d 806, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 308, 756 P.2d 1203.\n\nContractor furnishing purchased materials to federal government liable for tax.— Since general contractor was required by contracts with federal government to furnish materials to be used on federal reservation in New Mexico, the contractor purchased the materials, became the owner thereof, and was liable for the use or compensating tax under § 72-17-1, 1953 Comp. et seq. (now repealed); and this was not taxation of government land or other government property.Robert E. McKee, Gen. Contractor, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1957-NMSC-082, 63 N.M. 185, 315 P.2d 832.\n\nExistence of promissory note does not make sale executory.— When purchase agreement was entered into out-of-state whereby purchaser would pay a deposit and make a promissory note for the balance, the agreement was not an executory document and failure to make any of the subsequent payments after the deposit did not render it executory. Therefore, the use of the article purchased was taxable pursuant to Subsection A(2).Garfield Mines, Ltd. v. O'Cheskey, 1973-NMCA-128, 85 N.M. 547, 514 P.2d 304.\n\nDistribution of advertising materials.— New Mexico retailer who contracted with out-of-state advertising coordinators, but exercised control over its distribution contractors in New Mexico, \"used\" advertising materials distributed in the state within the meaning of this section.Phillips Mercantile Co. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1990-NMCA-006, 109 N.M. 487, 786 P.2d 1221.\n\nAm.

Former Subsection E is now Subsection D.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, in Subsection D substituted \"January 1, 2005\" for \"January 1, 1992\" three times, substituted \"December 31, 2004\" for \"December 31, 1991\" following \"transactions after\" at the end of the first sentence, substituted \"2005\" for \"1992\" following \"calendar year\" at the end of the second sentence, and inserted \"except the nontaxable transaction certificates issued by the department for the period January 1, 1992 to December 31, 2001 may be executed by buyers or lessees for transactions occurring prior to December 31, 2004\" following \"that twelve-year period\" at the end of the third sentence; in Subsection E, inserted \"or to have a non-filed period\" following \"delinquent taxpayer\" near the beginning of the second sentence, inserted \"has filed returns for all non-filed periods and\" following \"until the person\" near the middle of the second sentence, inserted \"or to have a non-filed period\" following \"delinquent taxpayer\" near the middle of the third sentence, inserted \"has filed returns for all non-filed periods and\" following \"until the person\" near the end of the third sentence, deleted \"annually\" following \"report to the department\" near the middle of the fifth sentence, and deleted \"annually\" following \"report to the department\" near the middle of the sixth sentence.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, in Subsection D, converted the former \"ten-year period\" to a \"twelve-year period\" throughout the subsection.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, in the section heading, deleted \"farmers' and ranchers' statements\" following \"certificates\" and added \"Fee - Renewal\" at the end; added \"Subject to the provisions of Subsection D of this section\" at the beginning of Subsection A; and added Subsection D.\n\nExecution of certificate.— This section makes clear that only the buyer, who has or had applied for a registration number, may execute a nontaxable transaction certificate.House of Carpets, Inc., v. Bureau of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-034, 84 N.M. 747, 507 P.2d 1078.\n\nLiability for payment of tax.— Where a nontaxable transaction certificate has been properly delivered to a seller of service for resale, only the reseller of the service is liable for payment of the gross receipts tax.House of Carpets, Inc., v. Bureau of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-034, 84 N.M. 747, 507 P.2d 1078.\n\nTaxable transaction not transformed by \"nontaxable transaction certificate\".— Issuance of a \"nontaxable transaction certificate\" does not operate to transform an otherwise taxable transaction into a nontaxable transaction.Gas Co. v. O'Cheskey, 1980-NMCA-085, 94 N.M. 630, 614 P.2d 547.\n\nCommissioner (now department) has authority to issue regulations interpreting and exemplifying statutesconcerning the possession of nontaxable transaction certificates and he also has such authority as may be fairly implied from the statutory authorization.Rainbo Baking Co. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-139, 84 N.M. 303, 502 P.2d 406.\n\nWords \"properly executed\"are used in this section in the sense of completing - filling out and signing - the nontaxable transaction certificates.Leaco Rural Tel. Coop., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-076, 86 N.M. 629, 526 P.2d 426.\n\nTaxpayer not liable if certificates incorrectly issued.— Although receipts from transactions involving telephone service to schools, churches, police departments, fire departments and the like were not properly deductible in the first instance because the transactions were not sales of tangible personal property, nevertheless, when the telephone company accepted the nontaxable transaction certificates in compliance with this section, the deductions authorized thereby applied and protected the company from tax liability on receipts from those transactions, regardless of the propriety or impropriety of the certificates' issuance.Leaco Rural Tel. Coop., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-076, 86 N.M. 629, 526 P.2d 426.\n\nTaxpayer did not accept nontaxable transaction certificate in good faith and therefore was not entitled to safe harbor protection.— Where taxpayer, a private prison corporation, accepted a nontaxable transaction certificate (NTTC) executed by Torrance county (county) for taxpayer's housing of federal prisoners at the Torrance county detention center and then filed for a tax refund for gross receipts tax paid between 2010 and 2012, and where the administrative hearing officer for the New Mexico taxation and revenue department concluded that taxpayer, as the seller, did not in good faith accept the NTTC, executed by the county as the buyer, and therefore taxpayer was not entitled to the deduction from gross receipts it received for housing federal prisoners, the administrative hearing officer did not err in its decision, because the tax deduction under 7-9-47 NMSA 1978, was predicated on the county reselling a license to use the detention center to the U.S. marshall's service in the ordinary course of the county's business, and there was no evidence that the county was reselling licenses in the ordinary course of its business, and taxpayer was fully aware when it accepted the NTTC that there was no resale of services because the marshall's service was paying taxpayer directly. Taxpayer was therefore not entitled to safe harbor protection from the payment of gross receipts tax.CCA of Tennessee v. NM Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2024-NMSC-013,rev'gA-1-CA-37548, mem. op. (N.M. Ct. App. Jan. 21, 2021) (nonprecedential).\n\nReliance on certificates improper following change in law.— This section protects a taxpayer when the purchaser who provided the nontaxable transaction certificates (NTTC) has failed to live up to the promise that the actual transaction was nontaxable. However, it does not protect taxpayers from changes in the law that render formerly nontaxable transactions taxable. Indeed, a taxpayer has an affirmative duty to keep informed about changes in the tax law affecting liability and cannot escape tax liability for transactions based on NTTCs issued before a change in the law rendered the NTTCs invalid for those transactions.Arco Materials, Inc. v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-062, 118 N.M. 12, 878 P.2d 330,rev'd on other grounds sub nom.Blaze Constr. Co. v.

Ed. 2d 216 (1995).\n\nCertificate inapplicable to in-state ambulance receipts.— A nontaxable transaction certificate accepted by a taxpayer who will make initial use of the product or service outside of this state does not apply to receipts from the taxpayer's in-state ambulance service.McKinley Ambulance Serv. v.

The buyer must resell the tangible personal property or license either by itself or in combination with other tangible personal property or licenses in the ordinary course of business.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-16A-14.2, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 144, § 37; 1992, ch. 39, § 6; 1992, ch. 100, § 5; 1994, ch. 45, § 4; 2021, ch. 65, § 14.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective July 1, 2021, provided that a taxpayer may provide the taxation and revenue department alternative evidence to claim a gross receipts tax deduction in lieu of providing a non-taxable transaction certificate; and after \"certificate to the seller\", added \"or provides alternative evidence pursuant to Section 7-9-43 NMSA 1978\", and after \"buyer\", deleted \"delivering the nontaxable transaction certificate\".\n\nThe 1994 amendment,effective July 1, 1994, inserted \"or licenses\" in the section heading and in both sentences, and \"or license\" in the second sentence.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective July 1, 1992, inserted \"governmental gross receipts\" in the section heading; and inserted \"or from governmental gross receipts\" in the first sentence.\n\nOrdinary course of business.— Where taxpayer, whose typical business practices included owning, operating, leasing, and controlling generating plants and facilities for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to the public at retail, purchased turbines and related equipment to be used in the construction of a generating plant that would be conveyed to a municipality as an industrial revenue bond project, the sale of the turbines and related equipment was not in the taxpayer's ordinary course of business because the taxpayer had not previously purchased turbines and related equipment and did not plan to do so in the future, the taxpayer had not previously constructed generating plants, and there was no evidence that the transaction at issue was typical or customary within the taxpayer's industry.Pub. Serv. Co. of N.M. v. NM Taxation & Revenue Dept., 2007-NMCA-050, 141 N.M. 520, 157 P.3d 85.\n\nThe phrase \"ordinary course of business\"contemplates some evidence that a transaction is customary, normal, or regular within the company's own business or within the relevant industry at large.Pub. Serv. Co. of N.M. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dept., 2007-NMCA-050, 141 N.M. 520, 157 P.3d 85.\n\nLegislature possesses great freedom of classification in taxation field.— In the field of taxation, more than in other fields, the legislature possesses the greatest freedom in classification, and to attack such a classification as a violation of U.S. Const., amend. XIV places the burden on the one attacking to negative every conceivable basis which might support the classification and unless the classification is clearly arbitrary and capricious or void for uncertainty, the appellate court cannot substitute its views in selecting and classifying for those of the legislature.N.M. Newspapers, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-022, 82 N.M. 436, 483 P.2d 317 (Ct. App. 1971).\n\nScope of authority.— Commissioner (now secretary) has authority to issue regulations interpreting and exemplifying statutes concerning the possession of nontaxable transaction certificates and he also has such authority as may be fairly implied from the statutory authorization. This authority, however, does not extend to imposing a time requirement which would abridge or modify the deduction authorized by the legislature.Rainbo Baking Co. v. Comm'r of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-139, 84 N.M. 303, 502 P.2d 406.\n\nCertificate required.— Since there was no evidence that contractors provided \"nontaxable transaction certificates\" to their vendors when they purchased property to be used in fulfilling their government contracts, the technical requirements of this section were not met.United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nForm of certificate.— A seller's failure to possess a non-taxable transaction certificate in the form prescribed by the department and to procedurally present the form in a timely and proper manner provided a valid basis for denying the deductions claimed. A \"blanket exemption certificate,\" issued by the buyer and relied upon by the seller, failed to meet this section's requirements.Proficient Food Co. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1988-NMCA-042, 107 N.M. 392, 758 P.2d 806, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 308, 756 P2d 1203.\n\nReimbursement for services not sale.— Reimbursements for materials and supplies consumed in performing services under certain government contracts were merely reimbursements for those services and did not involve a sale by the contractors of tangible personal property to the United States nor qualify for a deduction under this section.United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).",

Receipts from the sale or lease of real property and from the lease of a manufactured home as provided in Subsection B of this section, other than receipts from the sale or lease of oil, natural gas or mineral interests exempted by Section 7-9-32 NMSA 1978, may be deducted from gross receipts. However, that portion of the receipts from the sale of real property which is attributable to improvements constructed on the real property by the seller in the ordinary course of his construction business may not be deducted from gross receipts.\n\nB. Receipts from the rental of a manufactured home for a period of at least one month may be deducted from gross receipts. Receipts received by hotels, motels, rooming houses, campgrounds, guest ranches, trailer parks or similar facilities, except receipts received by trailer parks from the rental of a space for a manufactured home or recreational vehicle for a period of at least one month, from lodgers, guests, roomers or occupants are not receipts from leasing real property for the purposes of this section.\n\nC. Receipts attributable to the inclusion of furniture or appliances furnished as part of a leased or rented dwelling house, manufactured home or apartment by the landlord or lessor may be deducted from gross receipts.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-16A-14.8, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 144, § 43; 1972, ch. 80, § 3; 1973, ch. 205, § 1; 1975, ch. 160, § 3; 1979, ch. 338, § 5; 1983, ch. 220, § 11; 1991, ch. 203, § 5; 1998, ch. 94, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For deduction of real estate commissions from gross receipts tax,see7-9-66.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective April 1, 1998, inserted \"or recreational vehicle\" near the middle of the second sentence in Subsection B.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective July 1, 1991, substituted \"manufactured\" for \"mobile\" in the section heading and throughout the section.\n\nContract for correctional services not a lease.— Where a contract for correctional services provided that the contractor was paid based on the number of inmates housed and that the contractor had the right to fill up unoccupied space with inmates from other jurisdictions, the contract was not a lease for real property.Corrections Corp. of Am. v. State of N.M., 2007-NMCA-148, 142 N.M. 779, 170 P.3d 1017.\n\nReceipts attributable to improvements.— Real estate developer was not entitled to deduction for receipts from the sale of real estate attributable to improvements made on the land since those improvements were completed prior to the effective date of this section but sale was not made until after effective date, as the plain language of this section shows a legislative intent not to allow a deduction on receipts from sale of real property attributable to such improvements.Do a Ana Dev. Corp. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-018, 84 N.M. 641, 506 P.2d 798.\n\nMonies not received from lease of real property.— The receipts, which this section declares not to be \"receipts from leasing real property,\" are clearly intended to mean the monies or rentals normally received by operators of hotels, motels, etc., when being operated as such in their customary and ordinary manner, from the lodgers, guests, roomers and occupants thereof.Chavez v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-116, 82 N.M. 97, 476 P.2d 67.\n\n\"Lease\" not \"license\".— An arrangement between the owner of several properties used as bingo halls and the non-profit organizations who operated the bingo games was a lease and not a license where the organizations were required to pay rent, they were granted exclusive possession of certain facilities on the premises and the use of the facilities at certain times, and the owner could not revoke the agreement at will; although the arrangement was not a typical lease, restrictions in the Bingo and Raffle Act [repealed] accounted for the type of arrangement created and to deny that this was a lease would have made it impossible for bingo operators to enter arrangements that would qualify as leases.Quantum Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-050, 125 N.M. 49, 956 P.2d 848.\n\n\"License\" not \"lease\".— The buy-down contract payments were reimbursements to the taxpayer for her sales loss incurred as a result of engaging in the discount promotions and where the shelf-display contract receipts were taxable pursuant to this section because those contracts bore a much greater resemblance to a license than to the creation and conveyance of an interest in real property that would have constituted a lease.Grogan v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMCA-033, 133 N.M. 354, 62 P.3d 1236, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 413, 63 P.3d 516.\n\nYearly lease of motel.— Since taxpayers leased motel to a railway on an annual basis at a fixed rental, having no relationship to whether the railway company let the rooms to lodgers, guests or roomers, the rental received by the taxpayer was not income received from lodgers, guests or roomers, but was income by way of rental received from the lessee railway for the entire premises, and was deductible from gross receipts.Chavez v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-116, 82 N.M. 97, 476 P.2d 67.\n\nReceipts from license agreements not deductible.— Agreements between the taxpayer and several other companies providing for the use of space in the taxpayer's department stores for the purpose of retailing certain items, which agreements expressly negatived the intention to create a lease, constituted licenses, the money from selling which was not deductible from the gross receipts tax under this section.S.S.

Receipts from selling tangible personal property, or from selling licenses to use digital goods for the purpose of loaning those digital goods to the public, to the United States or to New Mexico or a governmental unit, subdivision, agency, department or instrumentality thereof may be deducted from gross receipts or from governmental gross receipts. Unless contrary to federal law, the deduction provided by this subsection does not apply to:\n\n(1) receipts from selling metalliferous mineral ore;\n\n(2) receipts from selling tangible personal property that is or will be incorporated into a metropolitan redevelopment project created under the Metropolitan Redevelopment Code;\n\n(3) receipts from selling construction material, excluding tangible personal property, whether removable or non-removable, that is or would be classified for depreciation purposes as three-year property, five-year property, seven-year property or ten-year property, including indirect costs related to the asset basis, by Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as that section may be amended or renumbered; or\n\n(4) that portion of the receipts from performing a \"service\" that reflects the value of tangible personal property utilized or produced in performance of such service.\n\nB.

When a seller, in good faith, deducts receipts for tangible personal property or licenses to use digital goods for the purpose of loaning those digital goods to the public sold to the state or a governmental unit, subdivision, agency, department or instrumentality thereof, after receiving written assurances from the buyer's representative that the property sold is not construction material, the department shall not assert in a later assessment or audit of the seller that the receipts are not deductible pursuant to Paragraph (3) of Subsection A of this section.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-16A-14.9, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 144, § 44; 1976, ch. 25, § 2; 1985, ch. 225, § 4; 1989, ch. 115, § 5; 1992, ch. 100, § 7; 1993, ch. 31, § 11; 1995, ch. 50, § 3; 2000, ch. 84, § 5; 2000, ch. 98, § 3; 2001, ch. 343, § 5; 2003, ch. 272, § 6; 2003, ch. 330, § 2; 2018, ch. 58, § 1; 2023, ch. 85, § 15.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective July 1, 2023, added to a deduction for gross receipts tax for licenses to use digital goods sold to a governmental entity when subsequently loaning those digital goods to the public; in Subsection A, in the introductory paragraph, after \"tangible personal property\", added \"or from selling licenses to use digital goods for the purpose of loaning those digital goods to the public\"; in Subsection B, after \"tangible personal property\", added \"or from selling licenses to use digital goods for the purpose of loaning those digital goods to the public\"; and in Subsection C, after \"tangible personal property\", added \"or licenses to use digital goods for the purpose of loaning those digital goods to the public\".\n\nThe 2018 amendment,effective March 2, 2018, clarified the meaning of construction material as used in the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act; and in Paragraph A(3), after \"construction material,\" added the remainder of the paragraph.\n\n2003 Amendments.— Laws 2003, ch. 330, § 2, effective June 20, 2003, deleted \"as defined in Subsection K of Section 7-9-3 NMSA 1978\" near the middle of Paragraph A(4); in Subsection C substituted \"shall not assert\" for \"is precluded from asserting\" following \"material, the department\" near the middle and inserted \"of the seller\" following \"assessment or audit\" near the end.\n\nLaws 2003, ch. 272, § 6, effective July 1, 2003, in Subsection A, deleted \"or\" preceding \"subdivision, agency\"; and in Paragraph A(4), substituted \"Subsection M\" for \"Subsection K\".\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, substituted \"construction material\" for \"tangible personal property that will become an ingredient or component part of a construction project\" in Paragraph A(3); and added Subsection C.\n\nThe 2000 amendment,effective March 7, 2000, inserted \"for any purpose\" following \"personal property\" in Subsection B.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, inserted \"tax\" following \"governmental gross receipts\" in the section heading, deleted \"nonfissionable\" preceding \"metalliferous\" in Paragraph C(1), and made a minor stylistic change.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, deleted \"or any agency or instrumentality thereof\" following \"United States\" and substituted \"any governmental unit or subdivision, agency, department or instumentality\" for \"any political subdivision\" in Subsection A, and deleted \"the governing body of\" following \"personal property to\" and substituted \"nation or pueblo or any governmental subdivision, agency, department or instrumentality thereof\" for \"or Indian pueblo\" in Subsection B.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective July 1, 1992, inserted \"governmental gross receipts\" in the section heading; added \"or from governmental gross receipts\" at the end of Subsections A and B; substituted \"that\" for \"which\" in Subsection C(2); and substituted \"that\" for \"which\" in Subsection C(4), while deleting \"is not deductible\" at the end of that subsection.\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective July 1, 1989, designated the formerly undesignated first sentence as Subsection A, while substituting therein \"as provided otherwise in Subsection C of this section\" for \"for receipts from selling nonfissionable metalliferous mineral ore and except for receipts from selling tangible personal property which is or will be incorporated into a metropolitan redevelopment project created under the Metropolitan Redevelopment Code; designated the formerly undesignated second sentence as Subsection B, while substituting all of the language thereof preceding \"to\" for \"Receipts from selling tangible personal property other than nonfissionable metalliferous mineral ore\"; added the introductory paragraph of Subsection C and Subsections C(1) through C(3); and designated the formerly undesignated third sentence as Subsection C(4).\n\nEffect on government's contract costs does not invalidate tax.— That the gross receipts tax may increase cost on a contract to the government does not validate the tax on the grounds that a state may not directly tax the federal government where its legal incidence falls elsewhere.United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nSuppliers of personal property for federal agents entitled to deduction.— If contractors are procurement agents for the federal government, their suppliers of tangible personal property would be entitled to a tax deduction.United States v. New Mexico, 624 F.2d 111 (10th Cir. 1980),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nTax proper unless purchasing contractors agents of United States.— Since contracts do not authorize the contractors to act as agents of the United States in purchasing supplies and materials, an application of the gross receipts tax to the contractual transactions for materials and supplies is not unconstitutional.United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nConstruction project includes wide variety of activities.— This section was intended to make sales of construction materials to governmental entities taxable when the materials were to be incorporated into construction projects. Contrary to taxpayer's argument that Regulation GR 51:16 (now 3.2.1.11 NMAC) establishes a definite test for determining whether an endeavor is a \"construction project,\" this regulation merely states nonexclusive guidelines for determining whether materials constitute a component part of a construction project. Thus, construction projects include the wide variety of activities listed in 7-9-3C NMSA 1978.Arco Materials, Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-062, 118 N.M. 12, 878 P.2d 330,rev'd on other grounds sub nom.Blaze Constr. Co. v.

Ed. 2d 216 (1995).\n\nDirect passage of title to government insufficient to establish agency.— That title to tangible personal property passes directly from the vendor to the federal government is insufficient in itself to establish an agency relationship.United States v. New Mexico, 455 F. Supp. 993 (D.N.M. 1978),aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 624 F.2d 111 (10th Cir. 1980),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nContract and circumstances establish agency relationship.— In determining whether contractors are procurement agents of the federal government, the surrounding facts and contract provisions must be analyzed, and specific words naming the contractors as agents are not required so long as it is clear from the contracts and the factual circumstances that the relationship is one of agency.United States v. New Mexico, 455 F. Supp. 993 (D.N.M. 1978),aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 624 F.2d 111 (10th Cir. 1980),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nDetermining whether contractor was a federal agent.— Facts that contracts were management contracts, in existence for nearly 30 years and conducted in government-owned facilities with government-owned funds for the purpose of carrying out significant energy research and development administration statutory responsibilities, were important in determining whether contractor was an agent of the federal government.United States v. New Mexico, 455 F. Supp. 993 (D.N.M. 1978),aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 624 F.2d 111 (10th Cir. 1980),aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).\n\nTax may not be imposed on non-Indian for purchase price of materials for tribal housing project.— The state, through its bureau of revenue (now taxation and revenue department) and the commissioner of revenue (now secretary of the taxation and revenue department), may not impose upon a non-Indian construction company its gross receipts tax for the purchase price of materials used in connection with a tribal housing project on the Mescalero Apache reservation.Mescalero Apache Tribe v. O'Cheskey, 439 F. Supp. 1063 (D.N.M. 1977),aff'd, 625 F.2d 967 (10th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 959, 101 S. Ct. 1417, 67 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1981), reh'g denied, 455 U.S. 929, 102 S. Ct. 1296, 71 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1982).\n\nTelephone service.— Decision that a telephone company was not entitled to a deduction under this section for receipts collected for intrastate toll charges and local phone calls from certain government organizations and organizations which had been granted federal income tax exemptions would be held, since there was a reasonable basis for differentiating between electricity (declared to be tangible personalty at 7-9-3J NMSA 1978) and telephone communications where the evidence showed that more was involved in the telephone business than the selling of electricity.Leaco Rural Tel. Coop., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-076, 86 N.M. 629, 526 P.2d 426.",

Commissions of advertising agencies from performing services in this state may not be deducted from gross receipts under this section.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-16A-14.10, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 144, § 45; Laws 1986, ch. 20, § 65; Laws 1986, ch. 52, § 2; 1993, ch. 31, § 12.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1988, ch. 19, § 5, effective July 1, 1988, repealed Laws 1986, ch. 20, § 129 and Laws 1986, ch. 52, § 5, which amended versions of this section which were to take effect July 1, 1988.\n\nLaws 1988, ch. 19, § 2 repealed and reenacted 7-9-55 NMSA 1978 as amended by Laws 1986, ch. 20, § 65 and Laws 1986, ch. 52, § 2, effective July 1, 1990; however, Laws 1990, ch. 27, § 2A repealed Laws 1988, ch. 19, § 2, effective May 16, 1990.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, inserted \"governmental gross receipts tax\" in the section heading; inserted the subsection designations A and C; and added Subsection B.\n\nConstitutionality.— The New Mexico gross receipts tax did not violate the commerce clause of the United States constitution, as applied to a California corporation which owned and operated a food and restaurant supply business with a warehouse located in Texas, and which sold food and other restaurant supplies to restaurants for use in New Mexico by obtaining orders for deliveries by telephoning the restaurants and taking down the orders over the phone, then delivering the goods in its own trucks from its warehouse in Texas to the restaurants in New Mexico.Proficient Food Co. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1988-NMCA-042, 107 N.M. 392, 758 P.2d 806, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 308, 756 P.2d 1203.\n\nAll interstate commerce is not per se immunefrom taxation.Spillers v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-097, 82 N.M. 41, 475 P.2d 41, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.\n\nScope of deduction.— This section permits deduction from gross receipts to the extent that the imposition of gross receipts tax would be unlawful under the United States constitution. If imposition of the tax upon the particular gross receipts is constitutionally lawful then such receipts are not deductible hereunder.Spillers v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-097, 82 N.M. 41, 475 P.2d 41, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.\n\nFederal law does not preempt tax assessed on receipts from transportation of railroad crew members within the state.— Where plaintiff contracted with union pacific railroad and burlington northern Santa Fe railroad to transport railroad employees to and from railroad trains both within New Mexico and from New Mexico to another state, and where the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department), after an audit, assessed plaintiff for gross receipts on the revenues from plaintiff's service between locations within New Mexico, and where plaintiff filed a complaint for tax refund claiming that federal law preempts the department from imposing gross receipts tax on the transportation of passengers traveling in interstate commerce by motor carrier, the district court did not err in granting the department's motion for summary judgment, because Congress, in passing 49 U.S.C. §14505, intended to address passengers of a motor carrier who were traveling as passengers in interstate commerce, and plaintiff's transportation of railroad crew members is not part of ticketed travel between states and thus the railroad crew members were not passengers traveling in interstate commerce traveling by motor carrier.Renzenberger, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2018-NMCA-010, cert. denied.\n\nImmunity from undue burdens.— To attain immunity a showing must be made of multiple taxation or the lack of a local taxable incident. Such showing is essential to classify the tax as one unduly burdensome to interstate commerce.Spillers v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-097, 82 N.M. 41, 475 P.2d 41, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.\n\nMultiple taxation.— If compensation received under advertising contracts is not protected by the commerce clause, then multiple taxation of the receipts would not bring them within such protection.N.M. Newspapers, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-022, 82 N.M. 436, 483 P.2d 317.\n\nClassification pursuant to constitutional mandate not violative of equal protection.— Granting a deduction, whether in accordance with statute or administrative regulations, of gross receipts which are not taxable by the state under the commerce clause, and denying such deduction with respect to receipts which are subject to state taxation, although the receipts in each instance are produced by comparable activities, is a reasonable and proper basis for classification.N.M. Newspapers, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-022, 82 N.M. 436, 483 P.2d 317.\n\nEqual protection.— Imposition of tax upon receipts derived by newspaper from advertising, while receipts of radio and television broadcasters are not taxed, does not constitute arbitrary and discriminatory treatment or classification in violation of the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions.N.M. Newspapers, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-022, 82 N.M. 436, 483 P.2d 317.\n\nEducational materials.— Tax levied on gross receipts from out-of-state sales of tangible personal property in the nature of reproducible educational materials is an impermissible burden on commerce.Evco v. Jones, 409 U.S. 91, 93 S. Ct. 349, 34 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1972).\n\nInterstate telegraph messages.— Employee who transmitted telegraph messages both interstate and intrastate is allowed to deduct receipts derived from interstate messages from gross receipts under this section.Ealey v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMSC-010, 89 N.M. 160, 548 P.2d 440.\n\nAccess charges and telephone carriers.— Since the access charge is for the service of transmitting the telephone signal between the inter-local access and transport areas carrier's switching center and the local phone customer, such taxation of access charge receipts is barred by this section.GTE Sw., Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1992-NMCA-024, 113 N.M. 610, 830 P.2d 162, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 605, 830 P.2d 157.\n\nAncillary services and telephone carriers.— Gross receipts tax imposed on receipts for ancillary services performed for interstate carriers is proper even though these services are related to the provision of interstate telephone service; the receipts are not receipts from transmitting messages or conversations by telephone.GTE Sw., Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1992-NMCA-024, 113 N.M. 610, 830 P.2d 162, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 605, 830 P.2d 157.\n\nNewspaper advertising.— Assessment of gross receipts tax against receipts of taxpayer derived from out-of-state advertising published in its newspaper was not violative of the commerce clause.N.M. Newspapers, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-022, 82 N.M. 436, 483 P.2d 317.\n\nCommissions for booking transportation services.— Imposition of gross receipts tax upon commissions paid to a resident agent of an interstate carrier of household goods for initiating or booking interstate transportation of such goods does not violate the federal constitution, and consequently such receipts are not properly deductible.Spillers v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-097, 82 N.M. 41, 475 P.2d 41, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.\n\nBurden on taxpayer.— Even if multiple taxation could be treated as invoking the protection of the commerce clause, the taxpayer, nevertheless, would have the burden of establishing his right to immunity from taxation.N.M. Newspapers, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-022,82 N.M. 436, 483 P.2d 317.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 68 Am. Jur. 2d Sales and Use Taxes §§ 35 et seq.",

Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-145, 87 N.M. 146, 530 P.2d 410.\n\nStatute is inapplicable to receipts from the sale and use of natural gas.— Where taxpayer, an electric power company, appealed from an administrative hearing officer's (AHO) decision and order denying its protest of New Mexico taxation and revenue department's denial of taxpayer's request for a tax refund based on its belief that its purchases of natural gas qualified for a deduction, the AHO did not err in denying taxpayer's protest because had the legislature intended to provide a deduction for receipts from the sale or use of natural gas, it could have specified the inclusion of natural gas within the statutory language establishing the deduction, as in the enactment of other legislation applicable to natural gas.Tucson Elec.

Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-114, 88 N.M. 432, 540 P.2d 1321.\n\nLaundry transactions are leasings.— Since the taxpayer's coin-operated laundry business is used for a consideration by persons other than the owner, the transactions are \"leasings\" as defined in Section 7-9-3J NMSA 1978, and the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction from compensating tax liability for the value of the washers and dryers.Strebeck Props., Inc. v. New Mexico Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-035, 93 N.M. 262, 599 P.2d 1059.\n\nConstruction of temporary provision.— Temporary provision enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 144, § 66, providing for exemption from higher tax rate for certain contracts \"entered into prior to the passage of this act,\" necessarily referred to contracts entered into prior to July 1, 1969, the date on which, pursuant to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 23, the bill became law, and an attempt by the commissioner (now the secretary of the taxation and revenue department) to set by regulation an earlier cutoff date (the date on which the bill was signed by the governor) was invalid.R.H. Fulton, Inc. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-133, 85 N.M. 583, 514 P.2d 1079.\n\nExemption not waived.— Failure to register pursuant to the terms of a regulation promulgated under a temporary exemption provision which was invalid because it set a cutoff date contrary to that provided by the legislature was not a waiver by the taxpayer of his rights under the statute.R.H. Fulton, Inc. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-133, 85 N.M. 583, 514 P.2d 1079.\n\nConstitutionality of former temporary exemption.— Former 72-16-5D, 1953 Comp., which exempted lump-sum or unit-price contracts entered into prior to the effective date of the act, which by their terms would not permit a price increase in the event of imposition of additional tax, from the operation of the gross receipts tax, did not amount to an arbitrary or unreasonable distinction violative of principles of equal protection and uniform taxation.Gruschus v. Bureau of Revenue, 1965-NMSC-013, 74 N.M. 775, 399 P.2d 105 (decided under prior law).",

      "text": "A. Prior to July 1, 2027, a taxpayer that is a national laboratory that provides technology readiness assistance to a business that is registered to do business in New Mexico and has licensed a technology from the national laboratory or is a participant in a cooperative research and development agreement with the national laboratory may claim a tax credit against the taxpayer's gross receipts tax liability imposed pursuant to the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act, excluding any local option gross receipts tax liability. The tax credit provided by this section may be referred to as the \"technology readiness gross receipts tax credit\".\n\nB. The purpose of the technology readiness gross receipts tax credit is to help businesses in New Mexico achieve technology maturation of the businesses' technologies developed at New Mexico national laboratories and increase economic development in the state.\n\nC. The amount of a technology readiness gross receipts tax credit shall equal the amount of qualified expenditures incurred by a national laboratory to provide technology readiness assistance to a business, not to exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) in a fiscal year per business; provided that the annual aggregate amount of credits allowed per national laboratory per fiscal year shall be limited to one million dollars ($1,000,000).\n\nD. A taxpayer may claim a technology readiness gross receipts tax credit for the taxable period in which the taxpayer provides technology assistance pursuant to this section. That portion of a technology readiness gross receipts tax credit that exceeds a taxpayer's tax liability in the taxable period in which the credit is claimed may be carried forward to succeeding taxable periods.\n\nE. To receive a technology readiness gross receipts tax credit, a taxpayer shall apply to the department on forms and in the manner required by the department. The application shall include the following:\n\n(1) certification from each business that received technology readiness assistance that:\n\n(a) the assistance was made in good faith to help the business demonstrate the feasibility of real-world application of the business's technology; and\n\n(b) the assistance was not otherwise available to the business at a reasonable cost through private industry;\n\n(2) evidence that the business that received the technology readiness assistance is registered to do business in New Mexico; and\n\n(3) evidence that the business's technology is a licensed technology from the national laboratory or the business is a participant in a cooperative research and development agreement with the national laboratory.\n\nF. In addition to the requirements in Subsection E of this section, a national laboratory shall:\n\n(1) create forms for technology readiness assistance requests and completion of technology maturation;\n\n(2) establish a technology readiness assistance program that will assist businesses to reach technology maturation;\n\n(3) consult with the secretary of economic development to seek advice on improvements in the operation of the technology readiness assistance program; and\n\n(4) establish a methodology to use state educational institutions that have demonstrated the capability to provide technology readiness assistance.\n\nG. A taxpayer shall not claim both a technology readiness gross receipts tax credit and a credit pursuant to the Laboratory Partnership with Small Business Tax Credit Act [Chapter 7, Article 9E NMSA 1978] for assistance provided to the same business in the same taxable period.\n\nH. If more than one national laboratory provides technology readiness assistance to a business, the national laboratories shall not claim a technology readiness gross receipts tax credit until coordination is developed between the national laboratories providing the assistance that generates a joint operational plan to ensure that:\n\n(1) the assistance provided by each national laboratory suits the business's needs and challenges; and\n\n(2) the combined claims for a technology readiness gross receipts tax credit will not exceed the limitations provided in Subsection C of this section.\n\nI. A national laboratory that claims a technology readiness gross receipts tax credit shall submit an annual report in writing to the department, the economic development department and an appropriate legislative interim committee. If more than one national laboratory claims a technology readiness gross receipts tax credit, those laboratories shall jointly submit an annual report. The annual report shall summarize activities related to and the results of the technology readiness assistance programs created by the national laboratories and shall include:\n\n(1) a description of each business's technology that has received technology readiness assistance, including progress toward technology maturation and whether, and to what extent, the business is still doing business in New Mexico;\n\n(2) results of surveys of businesses to which technology readiness assistance is provided;\n\n(3) the total amount of the technology readiness gross receipts tax credits received in the previous fiscal year; and\n\n(4) an economic impact study performed by an uninterested third party.\n\nJ. At any time after receipt of an annual report required pursuant to this section, the department or the economic development department may provide written instructions to a national laboratory identifying future improvements in the national laboratory's technology readiness assistance program for which it receives a technology readiness gross receipts tax credit.\n\nK. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"cooperative research and development agreement\" means any agreement between a national laboratory and a non-federal party under which the laboratory provides personnel, services, facilities, equipment, intellectual property or other resources and a non-federal party provides funds, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, intellectual property or other resources toward the conduct of specified research or development efforts that are consistent with the missions of the laboratory;\n\n(2) \"national laboratory\" means a prime contractor designated as a national laboratory by act of congress that is operating a facility in New Mexico;\n\n(3) \"qualified expenditure\" means an expenditure by a national laboratory in providing technology readiness assistance and is limited to the following:\n\n(a) employee salaries, wages, benefits and employer payroll taxes;\n\n(b) administrative costs related directly to the provision of technology readiness assistance;\n\n(c) in-state travel expenses, including per diem and mileage at the internal revenue service standard rate; and\n\n(d) supplies and services of contractors that are related to the provision of technology readiness assistance;\n\n(4) \"state educational institution\" means a state educational institution named in Article 12, Section 11 of the constitution of New Mexico;\n\n(5) \"technology maturation\" means technology that has been developed to a stage that results in a prototype or demonstration of the feasibility of real-world application of the technology; and\n\n(6) \"technology readiness assistance\" means assistance provided to a business by a national laboratory with the intent to help the business's technology achieve technology maturation.\n\nHistory:Laws 2020, ch. 22, § 1; 2022, ch. 45, § 1.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 2022, ch. 45, § 3(B) repealed Laws 2020, ch. 22, § 3 that would have repealed 7-9-96.3 NMSA 1978 effective July 1, 2024.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective July 1, 2022, extended the technology readiness gross receipts tax credit, and replaced the current funding structure with a standard tax credit capped at $1,000,000 per national laboratory per year; in the section heading, deleted \"technology readiness gross receipts tax credit fund\"; in Subsection A, deleted \"For taxable periods beginning July 1, 2020 and prior to July 1, 2023\" and added \"Prior to July 1, 2027\"; deleted former Subsection C and redesignated former Subsections D through L as Subsections C through K, respectively; in Subsection C, after the subsection designation, deleted \"Subject to the availability of funds in the technology readiness gross receipts tax credit fund\", after \"shall be limited\", deleted \"as follows\", deleted former Paragraphs (1) and (2), former paragraph designation \"(3)\" and the language \"beginning on July 1, 2022 and prior to July 1, 2023\" and added \"to\"; and in Subsection F, after \"requirements in Subsection\", changed \"F\" to \"E\".\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2022, ch. 45, § 2 provided that money in the technology readiness gross receipts tax credit fund shall be transferred to the general fund.",
