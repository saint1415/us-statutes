Barranca, 1971-NMSC-074, 83 N.M. 90, 488 P.2d 725.\n\nDuty on assessor where owner refuses to declare property.— In the event of a refusal of any person, owning or in control of any property, to declare the same as required, the duty then rests upon the assessor to make a true and complete list of the property.McKay v. Espinosa, 1958-NMSC-144, 65 N.M. 241, 335 P.2d 567.\n\nAssumption is that owner made assessment.— Only when the owner fails to make a declaration of all his property is the assessor given the duty of supplying one for him. There being no evidence to the contrary, it will be assumed in compliance with the law that the questioned assessment was not made by the assessor but was actually made by the assessee.McKay v.

Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nApplication of presumption.— The question whether property is entitled to the special valuation method in Section 7-36-20 NMSA 1978 is a question of classification; property that is classified as agricultural is entitled to the benefit of that section, whereas other property is not.Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rodarte, 2004-NMSC-035, 136 N.M. 630, 103 P.3d 554,rev'g2004-NMCA-055, 135 N.M. 630, 92 P.3d 642.\n\nPresumption in this section is applicable only to the value of property and inapplicable when the question is whether a taxpayer is entitled to the special method of valuation provided for in 7-36-20 NMSA 1978.Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rio Arriba Cnty. Assessor, 2004-NMCA-055, 135 N.M. 630, 92 P.3d 642,rev'd2004-NMSC-035, 136 N.M. 630, 103 P.3d 554.\n\nPresumption is rebuttableand is best characterized as a prima facie inference in that it shifts the burden of going forward with the evidence to the taxpayer to prove the contrary.Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620;N.M. Baptist Found. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1979-NMCA-102, 93 N.M. 363, 600 P.2d 309.\n\nPresumption of correctness can be overcome by taxpayer's showingthat an assessor did not follow the statutory provisions of the act or by presenting evidence tending to dispute the factual correctness of the valuation.N.M. Baptist Found. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1979-NMCA-102, 93 N.M. 363, 600 P.2d 309;La Jara Land Developers, Inc. v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 1982-NMCA-006, 97 N.M. 318, 639 P.2d 605.\n\nOvercoming the statutory presumption of correctness afforded to the assessor's valuation.— Where appellant sought review of the Bernalillo county valuation protests board's (protests board) valuation of appellant's commercial property, where appellant offered evidence of value tending to dispute the factual correctness of the county assessor's method of valuation, where the county assessor did not offer expert testimony disputing that appellant's method of valuation was a generally accepted appraisal technique, and where neither the protests board nor the district court ruled that appellant failed to overcome the statutory presumption of correctness afforded to the assessor's valuation, the appellant overcame the statutory presumption of correctness and the burden shifted to the assessor to prove that his or her method of valuation utilized a generally accepted appraisal technique.2727 San Pedro LLC v. Bernalillo Cty. Assessor, 2017-NMCA-008.\n\nSince taxpayer overcame presumption, burden rested on assessor.— This presumption is rebuttable and is best characterized as a prima facie inference in that it shifts the burden of going forward with the evidence to the taxpayer to prove the contrary; where taxpayer's protest and evidence overcame the presumption the burden rested on the county assessor to meet the contentions of the taxpayer.San Pedro S. Group v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1976-NMCA-116, 89 N.M. 784, 558 P.2d 53.\n\nSince taxpayer overcame presumption, burden rested on assessor.— While the county assessor's valuation is presumed to be correct, this presumption is rebuttable, and, once rebutted, the burden shifts to the county assessor to show the correct valuation.Bakel v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1980-NMCA-173, 95 N.M. 723, 625 P.2d 1240;Protest of Plaza Del Sol Ltd. P'ship v. Assessor for Cnty. of Bernalillo, 1986-NMCA-022, 104 N.M. 154, 717 P.2d 1123.\n\nThis section places the burden on the taxpayer to overcome the presumption of correctness, but, the burden shifted to the county assessor to show a correct valuation once that burden of correctness is overcome.Cibola Energy Corp. v. Roselli, 1987-NMCA-055, 105 N.M. 774, 737 P.2d 555.\n\nSince taxpayer's valuation is supported by the whole record in that after rebutting the assessor's valuation and presenting a prima facie case for its own valuation the board failed to rebut taxpayer's appraisal, the decision of the board will be reversed and remanded with instructions that the board enter judgment for taxpayer in favor of its valuations.Cibola Energy Corp. v. Roselli, 1987-NMCA-055, 105 N.M. 774, 737 P.2d 555.\n\nTaxpayer effectively rebutted presumption.— Since taxpayers presented uncontradicted evidence that access to their property was physically blocked and also offered the only substantial evidence of the fair market value of the property in the form of testimony by a real estate appraiser that because of the lack of access the highest and best use that the property could be put to was as grazing land by one of the adjoining landowners, and that as such it had a fair market value of $18.00 per acre, or $2034 and $5022 respectively for the two tracts, they effectively rebutted the presumption of this section that the county assessor's valuations of $313,875 and $169,500 were correct.Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.\n\nWhen presumption unrebutted by lack of comparable sales evidence.— Since the documents relied upon by a taxpayer as evidence of comparable sales are documents dealing with the sale of that very improvement whose valuation is the subject of the present dispute and the only evidence submitted by the taxpayer failed to present any evidence of sales of comparable property and the evidence submitted does not establish a market value under Section 7-36-15B NMSA 1978 and the statutory presumption of correctness still stands.N.M. Baptist Found. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1979-NMCA-102, 93 N.M. 363, 600 P.2d 309.\n\nPresumption of assessor's valuation not overcome.— Since taxpayer failed to present any evidence of sales of comparable property or evidence of value based on generally accepted appraisal techniques, and its only evidence, the purchase price of its land in question, did not establish a market value under Section 7-36-15 NMSA 1978, the presumption of the correctness of the assessor's valuation was not overcome.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nFailure to overcome presumption.— Taxpayers' offer of the price for which they had purchased the property in question as evidence of fair market value failed to overcome the presumption of the correctness of the assessor's valuation where the sales price was not the result of an arms'-length transaction because of the taxpayers' mailing campaign to convince landowners to sell their property to the taxpayers at below market prices.In re Cobb, 1991-NMCA-122, 113 N.M. 251, 824 P.2d 1053, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 44, 822 P.2d 1127.\n\nTaxpayers challenge of their property assessment, which proposed an alternative assessment method, failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the original assessment was correct.Hannahs v. Anderson, 1998-NMCA-152, 126 N.M. 1, 966 P.2d 168, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 532, 972 P.2d 351.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —72 Am. Jur. 2d State and Local Taxation §§ 713, 780.",

It does not specify the date on which the property's use defines its status for the remainder of the year and does not limit the evidence that can be considered in determining the status of property to the property's use on January 1. Property does not have to be in active use for exempt purposes on January 1 in order for an exemption to apply and evidence of the prior use of the property should be considered.CAVU Co. v.

Martinez, 2013-NMCA-050, 302 P.3d 126, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-004.\n\nExclusive reliance on evidence of prior year comparable sales was reasonable.— With respect to comparable sales, the legislature intended assessors and protests boards to consider only data available on January 1 of the tax year of the valuation notice.AMREP Sw., Inc. v. Sandoval Cnty. Assessor, 2012-NMCA-082, 284 P.3d 1118.\n\nWhere the county valuation protests board refused to consider the taxpayer's comparable 2009 sales evidence and relied exclusively on comparable 2008 sales for the valuation of the taxpayer's property for the 2009 tax year based on the board's interpretation of statutory and administrative code provisions that required property to be valued using only data available on January 1, 2009, the board's interpretation of the statutory and administrative code provisions was reasonable.AMREP Sw., Inc. v. Sandoval Cnty. Assessor, 2012-NMCA-082, 284 P.3d 1118.\n\nPast or future value not to serve as basis.— What the fair market value of a tract may have been in the past or speculation as to what it might be in the future cannot serve as the basis for valuation.Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620;Bakel v.

In the case of the failure or refusal to file the report required under this subsection, the department shall determine the value of the property subject to valuation from the best information available.\n\nB. Except as provided in Subsection D of this section, all property subject to valuation for property taxation purposes by the county assessor shall be reported as follows:\n\n(1) property valued in the 1974 tax year by the county assessor need not be reported for any subsequent tax year unless required to be reported under Paragraph (3) of this subsection;\n\n(2) property not valued in the 1974 tax year by the county assessor but that becomes subject to valuation by the county assessor in any subsequent tax year shall be reported to the county assessor not later than the last day of February of the tax year in which it becomes subject to valuation, but such property need not be reported for any year subsequent to the year in which initially reported unless required to be reported under Paragraph (3) of this subsection;\n\n(3) property once valued by a county assessor in a tax year, but which is not valued for a year subsequent to the year of initial valuation because it is not subject to valuation for that subsequent year by the county assessor, shall be reported to the county assessor not later than the last day of February in a tax year in which it again becomes subject to valuation by the county assessor; and\n\n(4) reports required under Paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection shall be in a form and contain the information required by rules of the department.\n\nC. Not later than the last day of February of each tax year, every owner of real property who made, or caused to be made, in the preceding calendar year improvements costing more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to that real property shall report to the county assessor the property improved, the improvements made, the cost of the improvements and such other information as the department may require.\n\nD.

A person who fails to make a report required under the provisions of Subsection A or B of this section is liable for a civil penalty in an amount equal to five percent of the property taxes ultimately determined to be due on the property for the tax year or years for which the person failed to make the required report.\n\nI. A person who intentionally refuses to make a report required under the provisions of Subsection A or B of this section with the intent to evade any tax or who fails to make a report required under the provisions of Subsection A or B of this section with the intent to evade any tax is liable for a civil penalty in an amount equal to twenty-five percent of the property taxes ultimately determined to be due on the property for the tax year or years for which the person refused or failed to make the required report.\n\nJ.

This penalty shall not be considered a delinquent property tax, and the provisions of the Property Tax Code for the enforcement and collection of delinquent property taxes through the sale of the property do not apply. However, the county treasurer may use all other methods provided by law to collect the property tax or penalty due. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Property Tax Code, amounts collected pursuant to the penalty provided by this subsection shall be distributed among jurisdictions imposing tax on the property in the same proportion as the amount of tax ultimately determined to be due for the jurisdiction bears to the total due for all such jurisdictions.\n\nK.

Assessor of Bernalillo Cnty., 1974-NMSC-073, 86 N.M. 589, 526 P.2d 183.\n\nApplicability of nonrendition penalty.— When the taxpayer failed to report a complete list of all taxable personal property, the 25% nonrendition penalty provided in Subsection I could only be imposed on the property the taxpayer failed to report, not on the portion that was properly reported.Zwaagstra v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1995-NMCA-047, 119 N.M. 675, 894 P.2d 1031.\n\nStipulation fixes property values for one year only.— A stipulation fixing property tax values for a specific year is not binding for any following tax year; it is res judicata only for the year in question.Protest of Plaza Del Sol Ltd.

Assessor of Bernalillo Cnty., 1974-NMSC-073, 86 N.M. 589, 526 P.2d 183.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Ad Valorem Taxes - Omitted Property and Improvements - Assessments,\" see 6 Nat.

Real property shall be described under a uniform system of real property description in accordance with regulations of the department. The department shall promulgate regulations establishing a uniform system of real property description to be used by the department and all assessors. The system shall include requirements for a comprehensive mapping or geographic information system, the use of uniform property record documents and uniform coding of real property descriptions.\n\nB. Real property that has been valued for property taxation purposes prior to the effective date of the Property Tax Code by a description consisting of a mere reference to the time and place of filing or recording in the office of the county clerk of any map or other instrument describing the property with sufficient preciseness to permit its identification shall be considered to have been sufficiently described for property taxation purposes. All prior assessments, records and instruments maintained or issued by property taxation officers which describe the property by such a reference are validated and given the same force and effect as if a description of the property had been used that would comply with this section.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-31-9, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 49; 1999, ch. 215, § 1.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, in the last sentence in Subsection A substituted \"shall\" for \"must\" and inserted \"or geographic information system\".\n\nAdequate and proper description of real estateis essential to taxation.Otero v.

Espinosa, 1958-NMSC-144, 65 N.M. 241, 335 P.2d 567.\n\nIncorrect notation of land in certain school district not essential.— A notation on the tax roll, indicating that the land was in a particular school district, was not an essential part of the listing of the property for taxation and did not affect the validity of the tax sale, though the land was not in fact in such school district.Greene v. Esquibel, 1954-NMSC-039, 58 N.M. 429, 272 P.2d 330.\n\nAid of extrinsic evidence makes description sufficient.— When there is uncertainty in description, if through the aid of extrinsic evidence, together with data afforded by the description itself such uncertainty is resolved, the description will be considered sufficient.Otero v.

The language of Section 7-38-24 NMSA 1978 and this section (formerly 72-2-37 and 72-2-38, 1953 Comp.) clearly and unambiguously gives to the county valuation protests boards the duty to hear a protest of the valuation of a taxpayer's property on any grounds whatsoever, including the grounds of allegedly unconstitutional discrimination in comparison with assessments of other properties.El Castillo Retirement Residences v.

Except for the rules relating to discovery, the technical rules of evidence and the Rules Civil Procedure for the District Courts do not apply at protest hearings before a county valuation protests board, but the hearing shall be conducted so that an ample opportunity is provided for the presentation of complaints and defenses.

Taxpayers are entitled to new hearings, at which evidence of valuation of comparable properties or other properties of the same class may be admissible in evidence and are to be weighed by the boards in arriving at their decisions.In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70,rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.\n\nRefusal to allow witnesses.— A notion of fairness is included within the concept of procedural due process, and accordingly in a hearing before an administrative agency, the agency must examine both sides of the controversy taking and weighing the evidence that is offered and finding facts based on a consideration of the evidence, in order to fairly protect the interests and rights of all who are involved; a refusal to allow witnesses to be called is a denial of procedural due process.In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70,rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.\n\nDenial of right to take depositions.— To deny the taxpayer the right to take depositions at county valuation protests board hearings denies him the right to a fair hearing. Such denial constitutes a denial of due process under U.S. Const., amend. XIV.In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70,rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.\n\nArbitrary for board to reach decision without considering all evidence.— The state has not given administrative boards the authority to catalogue which evidence shall be considered in deciding a protest, and when the administrative board has reached a decision and promulgated an order without considering all the evidence presented at the hearing, its decision and order is arbitrary and should be reversed.In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70,rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.\n\nFull opportunity to be heard required.— Administrative proceedings must conform to fundamental principles of justice and the requirements of due process of law; a litigant must be given a full opportunity to be heard with all rights related thereto.In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70,rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.\n\nRulings void if not in accord with statute.— Rulings by an administrative agency not in accord with the basic statutory requirements relating to the agency will render its decision void.La Jara Land Developers, Inc. v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 1982-NMCA-006, 97 N.M. 318, 639 P.2d 605.\n\nAdministrative law rules of evidence govern admissions.— While neither the rules of evidence, the rules of civil procedure nor the rules provided by the Administrative Procedures Act apply, there must be some rules to govern admission of evidence in proceedings before the county valuation protests boards, and these rules must be found in the body of administrative law that has grown up in the courts.In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70,rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.\n\nWide latitude allowed in admission of evidence.— The rationale for stating that the technical rules of evidence do not apply at protest hearings before a county valuation protests board is to allow wide latitude in the admission of evidence before an administrative board.In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70,rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.\n\nAdministrative Procedures Act (Sections 12-8-1 to 12-8-25 NMSA 1978) demonstrates that depositions are permissibleunder administrative law, to assist the agency and other parties in obtaining a fair hearing.In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70,rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.\n\nTaxpayer's evidence should be admitted to prove value.— The protests board could not rely exclusively on the county assessor's valuation of property even though according to former 72-2-3, 1953 Comp., the assessment must be at \"full actual value,\" and neither could it rely on comparable sales or sales of comparable lands where none have occurred; accordingly, the board should have allowed the admission of the only available relevant evidence which the taxpayer had. In situations where cash market value could not be determined, earning capacity, cost of reproduction and original cost less depreciation furnished relevant considerations for determining \"value.\"In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70,rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.\n\nRules of weight, etc., not necessarily limited.— Although the technical rules of evidence and the rules of civil procedure do not apply at protest hearings before a county valuation protests board, the rules relating to weight, applicability or materiality of evidence are not thus limited.San Pedro S. Group v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1976-NMCA-116, 89 N.M. 784, 558 P.2d 53.\n\nRules of weight, etc., not necessarily limited.— The rules relating to weight, applicability or materiality of evidence are not limited by the provisions of this section.Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.\n\nRequirement for findings.— By inadvertence, the legislature omitted the requirement of a \"decision\" by the board under this section. However, the practical reasons for requiring administrative findings are so powerful that the requirement has been imposed with remarkable uniformity by virtually all federal and state courts, irrespective of a statutory requirement.First Nat'l Bank v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1977-NMCA-005, 90 N.M. 110, 560 P.2d 174 (decided under prior law).\n\nPronouncement not final order subject to review on appeal.— Statements of a judge as to reasons for the judgment, made before the judgment is entered, which statements are not embodied therein, cannot be considered as a part of the judgment but are merely evidence of what the court had decided to do, a decision that the trial court can change at any time before the entry of a final judgment and an order of a protest board is analogous to the judgment of a court. Therefore, a pronouncement of a county protests board did not constitute its duly entered final order and was not subject to review on appeal of its final order.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nBoard must show good cause for delay in hearing.— When taxpayers show that the statutory time constraints have not been complied with and the taxpayer and board have not agreed to extend the time, the burden shifts to the board to establish good cause for the delay.Protest of Plaza Del Sol Ltd. P'ship v. Assessor for Cnty. of Bernalillo, 1986-NMCA-022, 104 N.M. 154, 717 P.2d 1123.\n\nSettlement negotiations do not toll time requirements.— Mere settlement negotiations, without more, are insufficient as a matter of law to toll the statutory time requirements.Protest of Plaza Del Sol Ltd. P'ship v. Assessor for Cnty. of Bernalillo, 1986-NMCA-022, 104 N.M. 154, 717 P.2d 1123.\n\nOrders invalid when board without quorum.— When the protests board, consisting of three members, instead of the six required by the prior version of Section 7-38-25 NMSA 1978, heard the protests and entered the orders, a quorum was not present, and the orders of the board were invalid.San Pedro S. Group v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1976-NMCA-116, 89 N.M. 784, 558 P.2d 53.\n\nProtests board without authority to reject agreement between assessor and landowner.— A county valuation protests board does not have authority to reject an agreement between an assessor and a landowner concerning the land value.In re Horn, 1980-NMCA-145, 95 N.M. 38, 618 P.2d 382.\n\nDecisions have force and effect of judgments.— The decisions rendered by an officer or a board legally constituted and empowered to settle the question submitted to it, when acting judicially, have the force and effect of a judgment.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.",

Further, only favorable evidence and the inferences to be drawn therefrom will be considered, and any evidence unfavorable to the findings will not be considered.In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.\n\nDistrict court acted outside its proper appellate jurisdiction.— Where petitioner, a retirement and continuing care community, appealed to the district court the Santa Fe county valuation protests board's (board) decision upholding the county assessor's denial of petitioner's request for a property tax exemption, the district court erred in exercising its original jurisdiction over the statutory claim and issuing new findings of fact which contradicted the findings of the board; the district court should have exercised its appellate jurisdiction over the board's determination regarding the applicability of 7-36-7(B)(1)(d) NMSA 1978 to petitioner and reviewed whether the board's decision was arbitrary and capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, or otherwise contrary to law as required under 39-3-1.1(D) NMSA 1978.El Castillo Ret.

Montoya, 2013-NMCA-048, 299 P.3d 456.\n\nPronouncement of board not subject to review on appeal.— Statements of a judge as to reasons for the judgment, made before the judgment is entered, which statements are not embodied therein, cannot be considered as a part of the judgment, but are merely evidence of what the court had decided to do, a decision that the trial court can change at any time before the entry of a final judgment, and an order of a protest board is analogous to the judgment of a court; therefore, a pronouncement of a county protests board did not constitute its duly entered final order and was not subject to review on appeal of its final order.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nDecision arbitrary if board has not considered all evidence.— The state has not given administrative boards the authority to catalogue which evidence shall be considered in deciding a protest, and when the administrative board has reached a decision and promulgated an order without considering all the evidence presented at the hearing, its decision and order is arbitrary and should be reversed.In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.\n\nRulings void if not in accord with statute.— Rulings by an administrative agency not in accord with the basic statutory requirements relating to the agency will render its decision void.La Jara Land Developers, Inc. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1982-NMCA-006, 97 N.M. 318, 639 P.2d 605.\n\nWhen county assessor did not follow any statutory method of valuationin 1976, but simply set the valuation of a shopping center back up to the 1972 figure, it was held that the decisions of the board were arbitrary and capricious, not supported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole, and otherwise not in accordance with law, and its orders were vacated.San Pedro S. Group v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1976-NMCA-116, 89 N.M. 784, 558 P.2d 53.\n\nCourt has no duty to search for authority supporting argument.— When taxpayer cited no authority to support its argument that the assessor's evidence of sales of certain property did not involve comparable sales, the appellate court had no duty to search for authority or consider taxpayer's claim unless it was apparent on the face of the claimed error that it had merit.Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.\n\nJudicial review based on whole record.— Judicial review of decisions by agencies are based on the whole record. This requires the courts to review and consider not only evidence in support of one party's contention, but also to look at evidence which is contrary to the finding; the reviewing court must then decide whether, on balance, the agency's decision was supported by substantial evidence.Cibola Energy Corp. v. Roselli, 1987-NMCA-055, 105 N.M. 774, 737 P.2d 555.\n\nNecessity of findings of fact and conclusions of law.— For purposes of judicial review, the order must, at least, indicate the reasoning of the board and the basis on which it acted; the expense incurred by having findings of fact and conclusions of law would be repaid 10-fold by the expense and energy saved on judicial review.Cibola Energy Corp. v. Roselli, 1987-NMCA-055, 105 N.M. 774, 737 P.2d 555.\n\nExhaustion of administrative remedies.— The legislature, in enacting a comprehensive scheme for administrative and judicial review, has provided the exclusive remedy for claims presented to the district court that property owned by all masonic lodges is exempt for taxation under N.M.

Bernalillo Cnty., 1978-NMSC-095, 92 N.M. 615, 592 P.2d 971.\n\nApplicability.— This section applies to property that is subject to valuation.

State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.\n\nTax deeds prima facie valid.— Since tax deeds attacked were signed by the proper officials, they were prima facie valid unless some departure from statutory mandates, which made the conveyance a nullity and void, was established. The burden in this respect was on the state in order to overcome the prima facie effect granted the deeds by former 72-8-43, 1953 Comp.First Nat'l Bank v. State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.\n\nTax deed issued before period of redemption has expiredis void.First Nat'l Bank v.

State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.\n\nState has no standing to assert rights of owner.— The rights preserved in the statutes are rights of \"owners\" as that term is interpreted, and the state cannot bring itself within the protection of the sections. Unless the conveyances were void and a nullity, the state has no standing to assert rights given by statute to \"owners\" or \"persons entitled to redeem.\"First Nat'l Bank v. State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.\n\nState in no better position than other strangers.— The state is in no better position to avoid its tax deeds or to claim deprivation of rights guaranteed by statute to the prior owner than would be some other stranger to the right.First Nat'l Bank v. State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.\n\nAction to declare rights under the Property Tax Code.— A claim seeking to invalidate a tax sale due to inadequacy of price may be directed solely at the third-party purchasers of the property.Valenzuela v. Snyder, 2014-NMCA-061, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-005.\n\nWhere plaintiffs owed delinquent property taxes; the department sold the property at auction; the department established the minimum bid as $215; the fair market value of the property was at least $25,000; the buyers of the property, who were the only bidders, paid $215 for the property; the department issued a tax deed to the buyers; and plaintiffs filed suit against the buyers to set aside the sale, the suit against the buyers was permissible.Valenzuela v. Snyder, 2014-NMCA-061, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-005.\n\nInadequacy of purchase price.— The inadequacy of the purchase price or gross disproportionality between the purchase price and the property's value are not grounds for setting aside a tax sale.Valenzuela v. Snyder, 2014-NMCA-061, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-005.\n\nWhere plaintiffs owed delinquent property taxes; the department sold the property at auction; the department established the minimum bid as $215; the fair market value of the property was at least $25,000; the buyers of the property, who were the only bidders, paid $215 for the property; the department issued a tax deed to the buyers; and plaintiffs filed suit against the buyers to set aside the sale, the inadequacy of the purchase price or gross disproportionality between the purchase price and the property's value were not unconscionable and were not grounds for setting aside the tax sale.Valenzuela v. Snyder, 2014-NMCA-061, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-005.\n\nFailure of proper notice would not invalidate sale.— If a valid assessment and levy had been made of the taxes, the county treasurer's failure to give a proper notice would not invalidate the tax sales. The neglect to give a proper notice or failure to give any notice at all would not discharge the tax or present a valid obstacle to the collection thereof.Greene v. Esquibel, 1954-NMSC-039, 58 N.M. 429, 272 P.2d 330.\n\nContinuity of adverse possession interrupted where land forfeited for taxes.— If, during the running of the statute of limitations in favor of the adverse occupant of land, the land is forfeited to the state for taxes, the general rule is that continuity of possession is interrupted for the reason that the statute of limitations does not run against the state in the absence of some special provision to that effect.Greene v. Esquibel, 1954-NMSC-039, 58 N.M. 429, 272 P.2d 330.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —Easement, servitude, or covenant as affected by sale for taxes, 7 A.L.R.5th 187.",

The time requirements of this section are subject to the provisions of Section 7-38-83 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-31-66, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 106; 1980, ch. 104, § 1; 1982, ch. 28, § 23; 1983, ch. 215, § 4; 1990, ch. 22, § 8; 2001, ch. 253, § 2; 2001, ch. 254, § 2; 2018, ch. 50, § 2.\n\nThe 2018 amendment,effective May 16, 2018, provided procedures for the sale of abandoned real property for which delinquent property tax is due; in Subsection A, in the introductory clause, after \"return receipt requested\", added \"and, for abandoned real property, an additional letter sent by first class mail\", in Paragraph A(1), after \"date of the sale\", added the remainder of the paragraph, and in Paragraph A(2), after \"Section 7-38-68 NMSA 1978\", added the remainder of the paragraph; in Subsection B, added a new Paragraph B(3) and redesignated former Paragraphs B(3) through B(6) as Paragraphs B(4) through B(7), respectively, in Paragraph B(5), after \"property owner of\", deleted \"his\" and added \"the property owner's\", and after \"right to\", deleted \"enter into\" and added \"apply for\", in Paragraph B(6), after \"department the\", deleted \"taxpayer\" and added \"owner\", and in Paragraph B(7), after \"require by\", deleted \"regulation\" and added \"rule\"; in Subsection C, after \"owner of the\", added \"real\"; in Subsection E, after \"Proof\", deleted \"by the taxpayer\"; added a new Subsection F and redesignated former Subsection F as Subsection G; in Subsection G, after \"Proof\", deleted \"by the taxpayer\", and after \"that the\", deleted \"taxpayer\" and added \"owner\"; and added Subsection H and redesignated former Subsection G as Subsection I.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, in Paragraphs A(1), (2) and Subsection E, substituted \"by 5:00 p.m. of the day prior to the date of sale\" for \"by the date of sale\"; added Paragraphs B(4) and (5); in Subsection F, added \"by 5:00 p.m. of the day prior to the date of sale\" and deleted \"prior to the date of sale\" following \"interests and costs\"; and added Subsection G.\n\nThe 1990 amendment,effective May 16, 1990, substituted \"department\" for \"division\" throughout the section; added Subsection C; redesignated former Subsections C to E as Subsections D to F; rewrote the provisions of Subsection D which read \"Failure of the division to mail the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, or failure of the division to receive the return receipt shall invalidate the sale; provided, however, that the receipt by the division of a return receipt indicating that the taxpayer does not reside at the address shown on the most recent property tax schedule shall be deemed adequate notice and shall not invalidate the sale\"; and made numerous minor stylistic changes.\n\nTaxpayer testimony insufficient to create issue of material fact.— In the face of documentary evidence establishing that the initial payment made by taxpayer for delinquent taxes corresponded to payment of one-half of his delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest, taxpayer's self-serving testimony as to his subjective belief that he had paid his taxes for certain tax years was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to prior payment.Cordova v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2005-NMCA-009, 136 N.M. 713, 104 P.3d 1104.\n\nDue process required.— A tax sale by the division is a taking of property by the government, and the notice of such taking must comply with minimum due process standards under the United States and New Mexico Constitutions.Patrick v. Rice, 1991-NMCA-063, 112 N.M. 285, 814 P.2d 463, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 308, 815 P.2d 161.\n\nSection 7-38-70C NMSA 1978 subject to notice requirements.— The legislature did not intend to apply Section 7-38-70C NMSA 1978 (limitation period to challenge tax sale) when the state fails to comply with the notice requirements of this section and federal and state constitutional due process requirements.Hoffman v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-032, 117 N.M. 263, 871 P.2d 27.\n\nDue process requirements.— Due process requires that the state must provide notice of sale to parties whose interest in property would be affected by a tax sale, as long as that information is reasonably ascertainable.Brown v. Greig, 1987-NMCA-096, 106 N.M. 202, 740 P.2d 1186, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.\n\nPersons to whom notice is necessary.— In keeping with the intent of the legislature to notify \"each property owner\" of an impending sale of his property, it is implicit that the legislature also intended that holders of record title be notified of the same thing.Brown v. Greig, 1987-NMCA-096, 106 N.M. 202, 740 P.2d 1186, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.\n\nIndications of ownership.— When the record owner of three lots orally notified the county assessor that he no longer owned the lots and would not be responsible for the property taxes, that notice did not constitute a waiver of his right to be notified of the subsequent delinquency prior to the tax sales, where the purchaser never recorded his deeds, record owner repurchased the properties, and no documentation, other than the grant of an easement, appeared of record which would have indicated purchaser's interest in the property.Brown v. Greig, 1987-NMCA-096, 106 N.M. 202, 740 P.2d 1186, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.\n\nNotice requirements in effect at time of sale apply.— A tax sale is controlled by the notice requirements in effect at the time of the sale, not by those in effect when the tax lien arose.Buescher v. Jaquez, 1983-NMSC-107, 101 N.M. 2, 677 P.2d 615.\n\nReasonable diligence to locate taxpayer contact information.— Where the state failed to contact the utility company that served the nonresident taxpayer's rural property, to red tag the taxpayer's property with a warning of the tax deficiency, and to access public records in the state where the taxpayer was known to reside; accessed only two internet websites that contained published telephone and address information when the state knew that the contact information listed under the taxpayer's name was unpublished; and although the taxpayer was a prominent businessman and property owner in his home state, failed to use internet websites that would produce information about the taxpayer, the state was not reasonably diligent in attempting to locate the reasonably ascertainable contact information of the deficient taxpayer before selling his property at auction in violation of due process.Gates v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dept., 2008-NMCA-023, 143 N.M. 446, 176 P.3d 1178.\n\nDuty to seek correct address.— Subsection A requires the division (department) to send notice to delinquent taxpayers via certified mail, return receipt requested. This requirement implicitly requires the division (department) to send the notice to the correct address. The division (department) has an affirmative duty to seek out, by \"diligent search and inquiry\", the correct address of each property owner, and failure to do so may violate due process.Patrick v. Rice, 1991-NMCA-063, 112 N.M. 285, 814 P.2d 463, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 308, 815 P.2d 161.\n\nIncorrect address does not invalidate sale.— The return of a notice of tax sale to the department indicating an incorrect address did not invalidate the tax sale.Cano v. Lovato, 1986-NMCA-043, 105 N.M. 522, 734 P.2d 762, cert. quashed, 105 N.M. 438, 733 P.2d 1321 (1987).\n\nIncorrect address immaterial if notice received.— The incorrect address on the envelope is immaterial if the notice actually got to the right address. The statute does not turn on the technical accuracy of the address typed on the envelope, which is merely a delivery vehicle, but upon mailing the notice \"to the address\" shown on the latest tax schedule.Wine v. Neal, 1983-NMSC-087, 100 N.M. 431, 671 P.2d 1142.\n\nIncorrect address immaterial if no challenge on those grounds.— There is no basis for voiding a tax sale merely because the proper address was not correctly printed on the notice envelope, where there is no challenge as to whether the notice actually reached the correct address.Wine v. Neal, 1983-NMSC-087, 100 N.M. 431, 671 P.2d 1142.\n\nIntent of 1990 amendment to Subsection D.— Subsection D of this section, as amended in 1990, was intended to legislatively overrule the Supreme Court's decision inState ex rel. Klineline v. Blackhurst, 1988-NMSC-015, 106 N.M. 732, 749 P.2d 1111.Cordova v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2005-NMCA-009, 136 N.M. 713, 104 P.3d 1104.\n\nReceipt of notice of return receipt shall be deemed adequate noticeas long as the notice of the tax sale was mailed in compliance with Subsection A of this section.Cordova v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2005-NMCA-009, 136 N.M. 713, 104 P.3d 1104.\n\nFailure to notify rendering sale invalid.— Tax sale was invalid since the owner had sent the county a change of address and the division's attempt to notify the owner of delinquent taxes and of the tax sale failed, due primarily to the county treasurer's initial failure to properly record the owner's new address.Chavez v. Sharvelle, 1988-NMCA-005, 106 N.M. 793, 750 P.2d 1119, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 16, 751 P.2d 700.\n\nA tax sale may be invalidated and rescheduled if not conducted substantially in accordance with the tax code so long as the deed has not yet been issued and delivered to the purchaser.— Where, after a three-year period of nonpayment of delinquent property taxes by the owner of a ten-acre parcel of land located in Santa Fe county, the taxation and revenue department (department) placed the property up for sale at public auction, and where the department complied with the notice requirements of 7-38-66 and 7-38-67(B) NMSA 1978, but on the day before the auction, a department employee mistakenly notified the department personnel charged with preparing the next day's auction that the taxes on the parcel at issue had been paid and that the parcel should be removed from the list of properties for sale, and where, on the day of the auction, certain potential bidders left the auction after they were notified that the property would not be sold that day, and where the parcel was placed on a list of properties removed from the auction for a short period of time, but was returned to the auction list after the county treasurer's office informed the department that payment of delinquent taxes had not been made, and where the property was then sold to purchaser, the sole bidder, for the minimum price of $17,100, the amount of taxes, penalty, interest and costs owed to the state, and where, two days after the tax sale, the department invalidated the tax sale for not substantially complying with the requirements of the tax code after learning from a potential bidder that she had left the auction in reliance on the department's announcement and subsequent assurances that the parcel would not be sold on the day of the auction, and where purchaser filed a petition for writ of mandamus in district court, asking the court to order the department to issue a tax deed for the parcel, the district erred in entering a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the department to issue a tax deed, because the parcel was not sold substantially in compliance with the public auction requirement of the tax code when the property was sold without recognizing the property owner's interest and right to receive any amount generated at public auction in excess of the debt to the state, and by announcing at the outset of the auction that the parcel would not be sold that day, the department essentially negated the prior notice to potential purchasers required by 7-38-67(B) NMSA 1978 and undermined the legislature's purpose in requiring a public auction to increase the sale price.Dearborn v. Clarke, 2024-NMCA-002.\n\nValidity of sale not affected by failure to deliver notice.— Since party did not receive the notices required by former 72-8-30, 1953 Comp., to be mailed to him by the tax commission at least 30 days (now 20) prior to the actual sale, if such notice was mailed, it was specifically provided in that section that the fact that the notice was not delivered to the addressee would not affect the validity of any subsequent sale.Bailey v. Barranca, 1971-NMSC-074, 83 N.M. 90, 488 P.2d 725.\n\nEffect of failure of notice.— A tax sale will not be invalidated under the curative act for failure to give, or of the taxpayer to receive, notice of taxes due or that redemption time is about to expire.Bailey v. Barranca, 1971-NMSC-074, 83 N.M. 90, 488 P.2d 725;Worman v. Echo Ridge Homes Coop., 1982-NMSC-081, 98 N.M. 237, 647 P.2d 870.\n\nFailure to give notice does not constitute constructive fraud.— Failure to give notice of a tax sale of land or the failure of taxpayer to receive such notice, standing alone, does not constitute constructive fraud invalidating the tax sale.Lamb v. Manley, 1954-NMSC-046, 58 N.M. 292, 270 P.2d 706;Worman v. Echo Ridge Homes Coop., 1982-NMSC-081, 98 N.M. 237, 647 P.2d 870.\n\nThe failure to send notice of a delinquent tax sale to the record owner, and to red tag the land, does not amount to constructive fraud.Worman v. Echo Ridge Homes Coop., 1982-NMSC-081, 98 N.M. 237, 647 P.2d 870.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —72 Am.

Real property shall not be sold for delinquent taxes before the expiration of three years from the first date shown on the tax delinquency list on which the taxes on the real property became delinquent.\n\nB. Notice of the sale shall be published in a local newspaper within the county where the real property is located or, if there is no local county or municipal newspaper, then a newspaper published in a county contiguous to or near the county in which the real property is located, at least once a week for the three weeks immediately preceding the week of the sale. For more generalized notice, the department may choose to publish notice of the sale also in a newspaper not published within the county and of more general circulation. The notice shall state the time and place of the sale and shall include a description of the real property sufficient to permit its identification and location by potential purchasers.\n\nC. Real property shall be sold at public auction either by the department or an auctioneer hired by the department. The auction shall be held in the county where the real property is located at a time and place designated by the department.\n\nD. If the real property can be divided so as to enable the department to sell only part of it and pay all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs, the department may, with the consent of the owner, sell only a part of the real property.\n\nE. Before the sale, the department shall determine a minimum sale price for the real property. In determining the minimum price, the department shall consider the value of the property owner's interest in the real property, the amount of all delinquent taxes, penalties and interest for which it is being sold and the costs. The minimum price shall not be less than the total of all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs. Real property shall not be sold for less than the minimum price unless no offer met the minimum price when it was offered at an earlier public auction or the property is sold in accordance with the provisions of Subsection H of this section. A sale properly made under the authority of and in accordance with the requirements of this section constitutes full payment of all delinquent taxes, penalties and interest that are a lien against the property at the time of sale, and the sale extinguishes the lien.\n\nF. Payment shall be made in full by the close of the public auction before an offer may be deemed accepted by the department.\n\nG. Real property not offered for sale may be offered for sale at a later sale, but the requirements of this section and Section 7-38-66 NMSA 1978 shall be met in connection with each sale.\n\nH. The board of trustees of a community land grant-merced governed pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 49, Article 1 NMSA 1978 or by statutes specific to the named land grant-merced shall be allowed to match the highest bid at a public auction, which shall entitle the board of trustees to purchase the property for the amount bid if:\n\n(1) the property is situated within the boundaries of that land grant-merced as shown in the United States patent to the grant;\n\n(2) the bid covers all past taxes, penalties, interest and costs due on the property; and\n\n(3) the land becomes part of the common lands of the land grant-merced.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-31-67, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 107; 1974, ch. 92, § 24; 1982, ch. 28, § 24; 1983, ch. 215, § 5; 1995, ch. 12, § 12; 2001, ch. 253, § 3; 2001, ch. 254, § 3; 2005, ch. 211, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For laws relating to land grant-merced,see49-1-1 to 49-1-22 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective July 1, 2005, in Subsection E, provided that real property shall not be sold for less than the minimum price unless no offer met the minimum price when the property is sold in accordance with Subsection H and added Subsection H to provide that the board of trustees shall be allowed to match the highest bid at a public auction and purchase the property for the amount bid if the property is within a land grant-merced, the bid covers all past taxes, penalties, interest and costs and the land becomes part of the common lands of the land grant-merced.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, in Subsection B, substituted \"local newspaper\" for \"newspaper of general circulation\", added \"or, if there is no local county or municipal newspaper, then a newspaper published in a county contiguous to or near the county in which the real property is located\", and added the second sentence.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, substituted \"department\" for \"division\" throughout the section and substituted \"costs\" for \"expenses of the sale\" in Subsection D and in two places in Subsection E.\n\nNotice by publication inadequate for mortgagee.— Notice by publication, in compliance with this section, does not provide a mortgagee of real property with constitutionally adequate notice of a proceeding to sell the mortgaged property for nonpayment of taxes.Macaron v. Assocs. Capital Servs. Corp., 1987-NMCA-005, 105 N.M. 380, 733 P.2d 11.\n\nOwner's interest.— Subsection E of this section requires the department to \"consider\" both the owner's interest and the amount of delinquent taxes, penalties, and costs, but then the department is directed to set the minimum price as not less than the total of the delinquent taxes, penalties, and costs. Thus, the legislature does not appear to have required any definite amount representing the owner's interest as part of the minimum sale price.Cochrell v. Mitchell, 2003-NMCA-094, 134 N.M. 180, 75 P.3d 396.\n\nA tax sale may be invalidated and rescheduled if not conducted substantially in accordance with the tax code so long as the deed has not yet been issued and delivered to the purchaser.— Where, after a three-year period of nonpayment of delinquent property taxes by the owner of a ten-acre parcel of land located in Santa Fe county, the taxation and revenue department (department) placed the property up for sale at public auction, and where the department complied with the notice requirements of 7-38-66 and 7-38-67(B) NMSA 1978, but on the day before the auction, a department employee mistakenly notified the department personnel charged with preparing the next day's auction that the taxes on the parcel at issue had been paid and that the parcel should be removed from the list of properties for sale, and where, on the day of the auction, certain potential bidders left the auction after they were notified that the property would not be sold that day, and where the parcel was placed on a list of properties removed from the auction for a short period of time, but was returned to the auction list after the county treasurer's office informed the department that payment of delinquent taxes had not been made, and where the property was then sold to purchaser, the sole bidder, for the minimum price of $17,100, the amount of taxes, penalty, interest and costs owed to the state, and where, two days after the tax sale, the department invalidated the tax sale for not substantially complying with the requirements of the tax code after learning from a potential bidder that she had left the auction in reliance on the department's announcement and subsequent assurances that the parcel would not be sold on the day of the auction, and where purchaser filed a petition for writ of mandamus in district court, asking the court to order the department to issue a tax deed for the parcel, the district erred in entering a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the department to issue a tax deed, because the parcel was not sold substantially in compliance with the public auction requirement of the tax code when the property was sold without recognizing the property owner's interest and right to receive any amount generated at public auction in excess of the debt to the state, and by announcing at the outset of the auction that the parcel would not be sold that day, the department essentially negated the prior notice to potential purchasers required by 7-38-67(B) NMSA 1978 and undermined the legislature's purpose in requiring a public auction to increase the sale price.Dearborn v. Clarke, 2024-NMCA-002.\n\nThe department is not required to execute and deliver a deed if the property was not sold in substantial compliance with the tax code.— Where, after a three-year period of nonpayment of delinquent property taxes by the owner of a ten-acre parcel of land located in Santa Fe county, the taxation and revenue department (department) placed the property up for sale at public auction, and where the property was sold to purchaser, the sole bidder, for the minimum price of $17,100, the amount of taxes, penalty, interest and costs owed to the state, and where, two days after the tax sale, the department invalidated the tax sale for not substantially complying with the requirements of the tax code after learning from a potential bidder that she had left the auction in reliance on the department's announcement and subsequent assurances that the parcel would not be sold that day, and where purchaser filed a petition for writ of mandamus in district court, asking the court to order the department to issue a tax deed for the parcel, and where the district court entered a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the department to issue a tax deed for the parcel of land, finding that even assuming the sale was not conducted substantially in accordance with the tax code, the department had a mandatory duty under the plain language of 7-38-70(A) NMSA 1978 to issue and deliver a tax deed to petitioner upon receiving payment for the property and that the department lacked the authority to invalidate the sale once payment was received, the district court erred in entering a peremptory writ of mandamus, because the legislature intended that the department's authority to invalidate a substantially flawed tax sale to continue until the department has reviewed the conduct of the sale and determined that a valid tax deed can be issued.Dearborn v.

Notice of the sale shall be published in a local newspaper within the county where the abandoned real property is located, or in a newspaper published in a county contiguous to or near the county in which the abandoned real property is located, the week immediately preceding the week of the sale. In cases where abandoned real property is offered for sale via an online platform pursuant to Subsection D of this section, the notice of the sale shall be published in a local newspaper within the county where the abandoned real property is located, or in a newspaper published in a county contiguous to or near the county in which the abandoned real property is located, the week immediately preceding the week of the beginning of the continuous online sale. Online sales notices pursuant to this section shall also be published on the property tax division's website. The notice shall:\n\n(1) state the time and place of the sale;\n\n(2) if the sale is made via an online sale pursuant to Subsection D of this section, state the date and time the sale will begin and expire and the property tax division's website where the property being sold will be listed;\n\n(3) include the name of the subdivision in which the abandoned real property is located;\n\n(4) state the total minimum bid; and\n\n(5) provide the phone number of the property tax division and the web address where interested buyers may obtain copies of the list of properties to be sold.\n\nC. Abandoned real property may be sold at public auction either by the department or an auctioneer hired by the department. The auction shall be held in the county where the abandoned real property is located at a time and place designated by the department.\n\nD. Abandoned real property may be offered for sale via an online platform on the property tax division's website, and notice shall be given pursuant to Subsection B of this section. The sales of abandoned real property listed on the property tax division's website may be continuous until December 31 of the tax year in which the abandoned real property is offered for sale. For subsequent tax years, notice shall be given pursuant to Subsection B of this section before the abandoned real property listed on the property tax division's website can be reoffered for sale.\n\nE. Before the sale, the department shall determine a minimum sale price for the abandoned real property. In determining the minimum price, the department shall consider the amount of all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs for which the abandoned real property is being sold. If the department determines the total amount due is in excess of the sale price that could reasonably be made through public auction, the property tax division may offer the abandoned real property for less than the total amount of delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs due.\n\nF. A sale properly made under the authority of and in accordance with the requirements of this section constitutes full payment of all delinquent taxes, penalties and interest that are a lien pursuant to Section 7-38-48 NMSA 1978 against the abandoned real property at the time of sale, and the sale extinguishes the lien.\n\nG. Payment shall be made in full by the close of the public auction before an offer may be deemed accepted by the department. For abandoned real property sold via an online platform pursuant to Subsection D of this section, payment shall be made in full within one business day of the bid being accepted by the department before an offer may be deemed accepted by the department. Receipt of a bid from a buyer by the department is not acceptance of the bid by the department. The department shall notify the buyer whose bid is accepted by the department, and the one business day payment requirement begins at the time the buyer received notice of acceptance to the buyer whose bid was accepted by the department. Notice of acceptance of a bid sent to a buyer by the department may be sent via email. Failure of a buyer whose bid was accepted by the department and to whom notice was sent by the department to pay the full sales price within one business day invalidates the sale and the property can be reoffered for sale unless the buyer receives an extension to make payment from the department. Requests for time extensions and approvals of time extensions can be made via email.\n\nH. The board of trustees of a community land grant-merced governed pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 49, Article 1 NMSA 1978, or by statutes specific to the named land grant-merced, shall be allowed to exercise the right of first offer to purchase the abandoned real property if:\n\n(1) the abandoned real property offered for sale is situated within the boundaries of that land grant-merced as shown in the United States patent to the grant;\n\n(2) the offer covers all taxes, penalties, interest and costs due on the abandoned real property unless the minimum sales price is reduced below total amounts owed pursuant to Subsection E of this section; and\n\n(3) the land becomes part of the common lands of the land grant-merced.\n\nI. In the event that there is a competing interest in the abandoned real property by prior landholders, such as land grant owners, pueblos or nontaxable entities, the secretary shall determine who has the prevailing right of first offer.\n\nJ. The time requirements of this section are subject to the provisions of Section 7-38-83 NMSA 1978.\n\nK. As used in this section, \"right of first offer\" means the department is obliged to undergo exclusive good faith negotiations with the rights holder before offering abandoned real property for sale to the public.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 7-38-67.1, enacted by Laws 2018, ch. 50, § 3.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2018, ch. 50 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M.

Execution of an installment agreement under this section by a property owner is an irrevocable admission of liability for all taxes that are the subject of the agreement. The installment agreement shall be in writing and shall not extend for a period of more than thirty-six months. Interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance during the period of the installment agreement. The rate of interest shall be one percent a month, and no other interest on that portion of the principal representing unpaid taxes shall accrue while an installment agreement is in effect. The division shall not enter into an installment agreement with a property owner on or after the date of the initial sale of real property or manufactured home for delinquent taxes whether or not the real property or manufactured home is sold and a deed issued as a result of that sale. The division shall promulgate regulations establishing requirements for a minimum down payment and substantially equal monthly payments for installment agreements.\n\nB.

Lovato, 1986-NMCA-043, 105 N.M. 522, 734 P.2d 762, cert. quashed, 105 N.M. 438, 733 P.2d 1321.\n\nGrantees in quitclaim deed from purchaser of property sold for taxeswould take subject to all defects therein of which they knew, or which an examination of the record would disclose.State ex rel. State Tax Comm'n v. Garcia, 1967-NMSC-098, 77 N.M. 703, 427 P.2d 230.\n\nPurpose of statutes on tax deedsis to give a measure of certainty and security to tax titles.First Nat'l Bank v. State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.\n\nOriginal owner's right to purchase.— Former statutory language gave the original owner of the land the preferential right to purchase the property upon the payment of the full amount of taxes, penalties, interest and costs for which the property was sold by the tax sale proceedings. The purpose of the legislature was to grant a preference to the original property owner to become reinvested of his property upon payment of taxes, penalties, interest and costs.Trujillo v. Montano, 1958-NMSC-079, 64 N.M. 259, 327 P.2d 326 (decided under prior law).\n\nPower of treasurer (department) to execute tax deedis not exhausted until a deed is made in compliance with law.Brown v. Gurley, 1954-NMSC-025, 58 N.M. 153, 267 P.2d 134.\n\nThe assessment of property for taxationis one of the essential steps leading up to a sale for taxes. If an assessment is void, it follows inevitably that the sale based upon such assessment is likewise void.Baltzley v. Lujan, 1949-NMSC-065, 53 N.M. 502, 212 P.2d 417.\n\nII. CHALLENGES TO TAX SALE.\n\nA. GENERALLY.\n\nGrounds for challenge to tax saleare generally strictly limited to the grounds set forth in Subsection D of this section, but there could be such a degree of noncompliance with other required procedures that a tax sale could be voided on grounds other than those of that subsection.Cochrell v. Mitchell, 2003-NMCA-094, 134 N.M. 180, 75 P.3d 396.\n\nSubstantial compliance.— Subsection B means that a trial court is empowered to review the sale procedures, but not for the purpose of requiring letter-perfect compliance with each requirement of the statutes.Cochrell v. Mitchell, 2003-NMCA-094, 134 N.M. 180, 75 P.3d 396.\n\nA reading of the entirety of this section, together with the cases, indicates that the substantial compliance language of Subsection B of this section must overlay all the other statutes that comprise the Property Tax Code.Cochrell v. Mitchell, 2003-NMCA-094, 134 N.M. 180, 75 P.3d 396.\n\nThis section is \"curative\" statutethat stringently limits the grounds upon which a successful attack upon a tax deed issued by the state may be made. It also limits the time for bringing such action.Bailey v. Barranca, 1971-NMSC-074, 83 N.M. 90, 488 P.2d 725.\n\nTax deed prima facie valid.— Since tax deeds attacked were signed by the proper officials, they were prima facie valid unless some departure from statutory mandates, which made the conveyance a nullity and void, was established. The burden in this respect was on the state in order to overcome the prima facie effect granted the deeds by former 72-8-43, 1953 Comp.First Nat'l Bank v. State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.\n\nTax titles subject to attack for failure of procedure.— While the title received from the state is a new and paramount title in fee simple absolute, tax titles are commonly subject to attack for failure to comply with statutory procedures in the assessment and collection of taxes, in the sale of properties because of failure to pay taxes and in the redemption from tax sale.State ex rel. State Tax Comm'n v. Garcia, 1967-NMSC-098, 77 N.M. 703, 427 P.2d 230.\n\nB. STANDING.\n\nAppellants without color of title have no standing to contest deed.— Since appellants could show no color of title, they did not have title to the land at the time of the sale and were not the owners of the land sold for taxes and, therefore, could not claim fraud nor contest appellee's tax deed under provisions of former version of this section.Griego v. Roybal, 1970-NMSC-021, 81 N.M. 202, 465 P.2d 85.\n\nMere possession of landis not such substantial right as would constitute \"title\" required by this section.Griego v. Roybal, 1970-NMSC-021, 81 N.M. 202, 465 P.2d 85.\n\nState in no better position than other stranger.— The state is in no better position to avoid its deeds or to claim deprivation of rights guaranteed by statute to the prior owner than would be some other stranger to the right.First Nat'l Bank v. State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.\n\nState has no standing to assert rights of owners.— The rights preserved in the statutes are rights of \"owners\" as that term is interpreted, and the state cannot bring itself within the protection of those statutes. Unless the conveyances were void and a nullity, the state has no standing to assert rights given by statute to \"owners\" or \"persons entitled to redeem.\"First Nat'l Bank v. State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.\n\nC. PARTICULAR GROUNDS.\n\nFraud as grounds for challenge of tax deed.— Prior to 1973, constructive fraud by the officer selling property was a statutory ground for attacking a tax deed but in 1973, the legislature amended the Property Tax Code, omitting fraud by tax officials from the list of statutory grounds for attacking a tax deed.Cordova v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2005-NMCA-009, 136 N.M. 713, 104 P.3d 1104.\n\nFraud by county treasurer avoids tax title.— Fraud on the part of the county treasurer, either actual or constructive, will suffice to avoid a tax title and save property from forfeiture.Trujillo v. Dimas, 1956-NMSC-043, 61 N.M. 235, 297 P.2d 1060.\n\nConstitutional and statutory notice requirements applicable to Subsection C.— The legislature did not intend to apply Subsection C when the state fails to comply with the notice requirements of Section 7-38-66 NMSA 1978 and federal and state constitutional due process requirements.Hoffman v. State, Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-032, 117 N.M. 263, 871 P.2d 27.\n\nNotice of tax sale constitutionally inadequate.— The notice of a tax sale was constitutionally inadequate under both the United States and New Mexico Constitutions, since the notice was mailed only to the taxpayer's old address, the notice was returned with a stamp indicating that the forwarding address had expired, and the new location of the taxpayer was reasonably ascertainable since she had submitted a change of address to the county assessor.Hoffman v. State, Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-032, 117 N.M. 263, 871 P.2d 27.\n\nClear evidence necessary to set aside tax deed for fraud.— One seeking to set aside a tax title on the ground of fraud, actual or constructive, in giving out erroneous information, has the burden of establishing such fact by clear and convincing evidence, a mere preponderance will not suffice.Trujillo v. Dimas, 1956-NMSC-043, 61 N.M. 235, 297 P.2d 1060;Gallegos v. Quinlan, 1980-NMSC-065, 94 N.M. 405, 611 P.2d 1099.\n\nTax deed obtained by fraud may be attackedwithout regard to statute of limitations.Gallegos v. Quinlan, 1980-NMSC-065, 94 N.M. 405, 611 P.2d 1099.\n\nPayment of taxes under erroneous assessment good defense to sale.— When the owner of land who in good faith paid taxes under an erroneous assessment, thinking and intending the payment to cover the tax on his land, such payment constituted a good defense against the sale and tax deed based upon a second assessment of the same land with a proper description.Trujillo v. Montano, 1958-NMSC-079, 64 N.M. 259, 327 P.2d 326.\n\nIII. TITLE.\n\nA. GENERALLY.\n\nFormer vendor's interest transferred.— Under Subsection B, all of the former vendor's interests in the real property were conveyed to the defendants by the tax deed because the vendor is a \"former property owner.\" Thus, the vendor's legal title to the property was conveyed to the defendants because legal title is clearly an interest in real property. Further, the vendor lost its reversionary interest in the property because it lost legal title to the land.Southwest Land Inv., Inc. v. Hubbart, 1993-NMSC-072, 116 N.M. 742, 867 P.2d 412.\n\nFormer vendor's perfected interest does not survive.— The Property Tax Code states that \"all of the former property owner's interest in the real property\" is conveyed. The legislature did not limit the word \"all\". The second phrase states that the tax deed is accepted \"subject only to perfected interests in the real property.\" The legislature chose to use the same language in both the first and second clauses. Reading these clauses together and giving them their plain meaning, the vendor's perfected security interest in the property did not survive the conveyance by the tax deed. The vendor was an owner under the code and its perfected security interest was an interest \"in the real property.\" Even though the interest may have been perfected, because the interest was \"in the real property\" and because the vendor was an owner, the interest was conveyed along with all of the vendor's other interests in the property.Southwest Land Inv., Inc. v. Hubbart, 1993-NMSC-072, 116 N.M. 742, 867 P.2d 412.\n\nThe department is not required to execute and deliver a deed if the property was not sold in substantial compliance with the tax code.— Where, after a three-year period of nonpayment of delinquent property taxes by the owner of a ten-acre parcel of land located in Santa Fe county, the taxation and revenue department (department) placed the property up for sale at public auction, and where the property was sold to purchaser, the sole bidder, for the minimum price of $17,100, the amount of taxes, penalty, interest and costs owed to the state, and where, two days after the tax sale, the department invalidated the tax sale for not substantially complying with the requirements of the tax code after learning from a potential bidder that she had left the auction in reliance on the department's announcement and subsequent assurances that the parcel would not be sold that day, and where purchaser filed a petition for writ of mandamus in district court, asking the court to order the department to issue a tax deed for the parcel, and where the district court entered a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the department to issue a tax deed for the parcel of land, finding that even assuming the sale was not conducted substantially in accordance with the tax code, the department had a mandatory duty under the plain language of 7-38-70(A) NMSA 1978 to issue and deliver a tax deed to petitioner upon receiving payment for the property and that the department lacked the authority to invalidate the sale once payment was received, the district court erred in entering a peremptory writ of mandamus, because the legislature intended that the department's authority to invalidate a substantially flawed tax sale to continue until the department has reviewed the conduct of the sale and determined that a valid tax deed can be issued.Dearborn v. Clarke, 2024-NMCA-002.\n\nEffect of multiple tax sale certificates.— Although a tax sale certificate to which the deed in question could be traced was issued at a time when the state already had title pursuant to an earlier certificate and tax deed, the state's conveyance to the property owner was nonetheless valid. Deeds from the state do not purport to convey interests acquired by the state under any particular tax deed, regardless of certain tax sale certificates or deeds that are referenced in the conveyance. A deed from the state is a conveyance of its interest in land, not its interest in a particular tax deed or tax sale certificate.Johnson v. Rodgers, 1991-NMSC-059, 112 N.M. 137, 812 P.2d 791.\n\nTax deed subject to subsequent lien under \"betterment\" statute.— To subject a tax deed to operation of a subsequent lien under the \"betterment\" statute, Section 42-4-18 NMSA 1978, is not in conflict with Subsection B of this section, governing the issuance and effect of tax deeds - to preclude such a lien would foreclose an avenue of security for those performing services upon the property and allow unjust enrichment.Cano v. Lovato, 1986-NMCA-043, 105 N.M. 522, 734 P.2d 762, cert. quashed, 105 N.M. 438, 733 P.2d 1321.\n\nMortgagees cannot extinguish mortgage by tax deed.— When a tax deed grantee is the previous owner of the property, his mortgage is not extinguished.In re Bouma, 32 Bankr., 619 (Bank. D.N.M. 1983).\n\nTax deed grants fee simple absolute.— Once land is sold by the state for delinquent taxes, the tax deed issued becomes a new and paramount title in fee simple absolute, striking down all previous titles and interests in the property. This is to ensure certainty and stability in tax titles, and to promote important social and economic objectives such as raising state revenues and promoting land improvement.Worman v. Echo Ridge Homes Coop., 1982-NMSC-081, 98 N.M. 237, 647 P.2d 870.\n\nPerpetual grazing right extinguished by tax sale.— Alleged perpetual grazing right which arose either by express reservation in the deed or by prescription was extinguished by tax sale by the state.Huning v. Potts, 1977-NMSC-037, 90 N.M. 407, 564 P.2d 612.\n\nTax title is in nature of new and independent grantfrom the sovereign authority and is a new and paramount title in fee simple absolute, striking down all previous titles and interests in the property.Bailey v. Barranca, 1971-NMSC-074, 83 N.M. 90, 488 P.2d 725.\n\nFraudulent tax deed passes good title to bona fide purchaser.— A tax deed fraudulently obtained from the state is not void, but simply voidable, and there can be no cancellation when there has been a sale to a bona fide purchaser.State ex rel. State Tax Comm'n v. Garcia, 1967-NMSC-098, 77 N.M. 703, 427 P.2d 230.\n\nTenant may buy tax title.— A tenant who owes no duty to pay taxes for his landlord and who has not withheld rents due, or in some other manner lulled his landlord into tax delinquency, may, while in possession of the property, both buy a tax title and assert it.Gore v. Cone, 1955-NMSC-075, 60 N.M. 29, 287 P.2d 229.\n\nB. PROPERTY DESCRIPTION.\n\nThe test of validity of a tax deedis whether the description is sufficient, aided by data furnished by it, to identify the property. The substitution of \"NE\" for \"NW\" resulted in the identification of an entirely different parcel of property than that which was intended to have been assessed. Ambiguity may not be resolved by reference to the description of the property in the assessment rolls of prior and subsequent years.Brylinski v. Cooper, 1981-NMSC-028, 95 N.M. 580, 624 P.2d 522.\n\nProperty conveyed.— Lands underlying a dam and reservior and which are budgeted with severed easements for the maintenance and operation of the dam, were not covered by an assessment describing the estate as improvements. The lands were not sold for delinquent taxes and the tax deed, upon which plaintiff based its title, does not cover them.Rio Costilla Coop. Livestock Ass'n v. W.S. Ranch Co., 1970-NMSC-020, 81 N.M. 353, 467 P.2d 19.\n\nThe rules regarding sufficiency of descriptionsin deeds are applicable to tax deeds.Hughes v. Meem, 1962-NMSC-039, 70 N.M. 122, 371 P.2d 235.\n\nSale not affected by error in survey number.— When the tax deed issued to the plaintiff described the land as being located in homestead entry survey 370, instead of 378, the error was so manifestly clerical that the validity of the sale could not be affected by it.Trujillo v. Montano, 1958-NMSC-079, 64 N.M. 259, 327 P.2d 326.\n\nIV. REDEMPTION.\n\nTax deed issued before period of redemption has expiredis void.First Nat'l Bank v. State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.\n\nContention plaintiff prevented right of redemption unfounded.— Plaintiff's contention that he was prevented from exercising his right of redemption on property sold to state for delinquent taxes by fraud of county tax assessor is unfounded where fraud is based on assessor's refusal to alter the description on tax rolls in the absence of a court order.Trujillo v. Dimas, 1956-NMSC-043, 61 N.M. 235, 297 P.2d 1060.\n\nAdverse possession protected by redemption.— The right to acquire title by adverse possession is capable of protection by means of redemption from a tax sale.Morris v. Ross, 1954-NMSC-063, 58 N.M. 379, 271 P.2d 823.\n\nEffect of redemptionwill not be a transfer of the inchoate title of the purchaser at tax sale but will be to extinguish the tax sale; and, as to all other persons who might have had a right to redeem, the redemption is in their interest and, consequently, they are not adversely affected.Morris v. Ross, 1954-NMSC-063, 58 N.M. 379, 271 P.2d 823.\n\nFailure of notice to redeem.— The failure of the treasurer to send notice that the property had been sold for taxes and of the tax commission to advise of the sale and of the preferential right of redemption or repurchase were at most irregularities which were covered by the curative provisions of this article.Brown v. Gurley, 1954-NMSC-025, 58 N.M. 153, 267 P.2d 134 (decided under prior law).\n\nAm.

Money received by the department from the sale of real or personal property for delinquent property taxes shall be deposited in a suspense fund and distributed as follows:\n\n(1) first, that portion equal to the costs shall be retained by the department for use, subject to appropriation by the legislature, in administration of the Property Tax Code;\n\n(2) second, that portion equal to the penalties and interest due shall be retained by the department for use, subject to appropriation by the legislature, by the department in administration of the Property Tax Code;\n\n(3) third, that portion equal to the delinquent taxes due shall be remitted by the department to the appropriate county treasurer for distribution by the treasurer to the governmental units in accordance with the law and the regulations of the department of finance and administration; and\n\n(4) the balance shall be paid to the former owner of the property sold or to any other person designated by order directed to the department by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that the department may first apply all or any portion of the balance to be paid against the amount of any property tax, including any penalty and interest related thereto, owed by the person to whom the balance would otherwise be paid.\n\nB. As a condition precedent to payment of the balance of the sale amount received to the former owner of the property, the department may require any person claiming to be entitled to that payment to present sufficient evidence of proof of former ownership of the property to the department. The department shall adopt regulations providing for the procedures to be followed by persons claiming sale proceeds as former owners in those instances where conflicting claims exist or the department requires proof of ownership.\n\nC. If no person claims the balance of sale proceeds, whether the property was sold under the provisions of the Property Tax Code or prior law, as the former owner of the property within two years of the date of the sale and after a reasonable search to determine the former owner is made by the department and no former owner is found, the balance of the sale proceeds shall be considered abandoned property and deposited in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act [Chapter 7, Article 8A NMSA 1978].\n\nD. If the balance of proceeds from the sale after paying a higher priority claim under Subsection A of this section is insufficient to pay all of the next priority claim, then the complete balance shall be applied to that next priority claim as partial payment.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-31-71, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 111; 1979, ch. 61, § 1; 1982, ch. 28, § 26; 1986, ch. 20, § 117; 1990, ch. 22, § 10; 1995, ch. 12, § 14.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, rewrote Paragraph A(1) which read \"first, that portion equal to the expenses of seizure and sale shall be retained by the department and these amounts are appropriated to the department for use in administration of the Property Tax Code\" and made stylistic changes in Paragraph A(2).\n\nThe 1990 amendment,effective May 16, 1990, in Subsection A, rewrote Paragraph (2) which read \"second, that portion equal to the penalties and interests due shall be remitted by the department, to the appropriate county treasurer for deposit in the county general fund\" and added the proviso at the end of Paragraph (4) and, in Subsection C, substituted \"Uniform Unclaimed Property Act\" for \"Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act\".\n\nA tax sale may be invalidated and rescheduled if not conducted substantially in accordance with the tax code so long as the deed has not yet been issued and delivered to the purchaser.— Where, after a three-year period of nonpayment of delinquent property taxes by the owner of a ten-acre parcel of land located in Santa Fe county, the taxation and revenue department (department) placed the property up for sale at public auction, and where the department complied with the notice requirements of 7-38-66 and 7-38-67(B) NMSA 1978, but on the day before the auction, a department employee mistakenly notified the department personnel charged with preparing the next day's auction that the taxes on the parcel at issue had been paid and that the parcel should be removed from the list of properties for sale, and where, on the day of the auction, certain potential bidders left the auction after they were notified that the property would not be sold that day, and where the parcel was placed on a list of properties removed from the auction for a short period of time, but was returned to the auction list after the county treasurer's office informed the department that payment of delinquent taxes had not been made, and where the property was then sold to purchaser, the sole bidder, for the minimum price of $17,100, the amount of taxes, penalty, interest and costs owed to the state, and where, two days after the tax sale, the department invalidated the tax sale for not substantially complying with the requirements of the tax code after learning from a potential bidder that she had left the auction in reliance on the department's announcement and subsequent assurances that the parcel would not be sold on the day of the auction, and where purchaser filed a petition for writ of mandamus in district court, asking the court to order the department to issue a tax deed for the parcel, the district erred in entering a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the department to issue a tax deed, because the parcel was not sold substantially in compliance with the public auction requirement of the tax code when the property was sold without recognizing the property owner's interest and right to receive any amount generated at public auction in excess of the debt to the state, and by announcing at the outset of the auction that the parcel would not be sold that day, the department essentially negated the prior notice to potential purchasers required by 7-38-67(B) NMSA 1978 and undermined the legislature's purpose in requiring a public auction to increase the sale price.Dearborn v.
