Before making a distribution or transfer specified in Subsection A of this section to a municipality or county for the month, amounts comprising the net receipts shall be segregated into two mutually exclusive categories. One category shall be for amounts relating to the current month, and the other category shall be for amounts relating to prior periods. The total of each category for a municipality or county shall be reported each month to that municipality or county. If the total of the amounts relating to prior periods is less than zero and its absolute value exceeds the greater of one hundred dollars ($100) or an amount equal to twenty percent of the average distribution or transfer amount for that municipality or county, then the following procedures shall be carried out:\n\n(1) all negative amounts relating to any period prior to the three calendar years preceding the year of the current month, net of any positive amounts in that same time period for the same taxpayers to which the negative amounts pertain, shall be excluded from the total relating to prior periods. Except as provided in Paragraph (2) of this subsection, the net receipts to be distributed or transferred to the municipality or county shall be adjusted to equal the amount for the current month plus the revised total for prior periods; and\n\n(2) if the revised total for prior periods determined pursuant to Paragraph (1) of this subsection is negative and its absolute value exceeds the greater of one hundred dollars ($100) or an amount equal to twenty percent of the average distribution or transfer amount for that municipality or county, the revised total for prior periods shall be excluded from the distribution or transfers and the net receipts to be distributed or transferred to the municipality or county shall be equal to the amount for the current month.\n\nC. The department shall recover from a municipality or county the amount excluded by Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of this section. This amount may be referred to as the \"recoverable amount\".\n\nD. Prior to or concurrently with the distribution or transfer to the municipality or county of the adjusted net receipts, the department shall notify the municipality or county whose distribution or transfer has been adjusted pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of this section:\n\n(1) that the department has made such an adjustment, that the department has determined that a specified amount is recoverable from the municipality or county and that the department intends to recover that amount from future distributions or transfers to the municipality or county;\n\n(2) that the municipality or county has ninety days from the date notice is made to enter into a mutually agreeable repayment agreement with the department;\n\n(3) that if the municipality or county takes no action within the ninety-day period, the department will recover the amount from the next six distributions or transfers following the expiration of the ninety days; and\n\n(4) that the municipality or county may inspect, pursuant to Section 7-1-8.9 NMSA 1978, an application for a claim for refund that gave rise to the recoverable amount, exclusive of any amended returns that may be attached to the application.\n\nE. No earlier than ninety days from the date notice pursuant to Subsection D of this section is given, the department shall begin recovering the recoverable amount from a municipality or county as follows:\n\n(1) the department may collect the recoverable amount by:\n\n(a) decreasing distributions or transfers to the municipality or county in accordance with a repayment agreement entered into with the municipality or county; or\n\n(b) except as provided in Paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, if the municipality or county fails to act within the ninety days, decreasing the amount of the next six distributions or transfers to the municipality or county following expiration of the ninety-day period in increments as nearly equal as practicable and sufficient to recover the amount;\n\n(2) if, pursuant to Subsection B of this section, the secretary determines that the recoverable amount is more than fifty percent of the average distribution or transfer of net receipts for that municipality or county, the secretary:\n\n(a) shall recover only up to fifty percent of the average distribution or transfer of net receipts for that municipality or county; and\n\n(b) may, in the secretary's discretion, waive recovery of any portion of the recoverable amount, subject to approval by the state board of finance; and\n\n(3) if, after application of a refund claim, audit adjustment, correction of a mistake by the department or other adjustment of a prior period, but prior to any recovery of the department pursuant to this section, the total net receipts of a municipality or county for the twelve-month period beginning with the current month are reduced or are projected to be reduced to less than fifty percent of the average distribution or transfer of net receipts, the secretary may waive recovery of any portion of the recoverable amount, subject to approval by the state board of finance.\n\nF. No later than ninety days from the date notice pursuant to Subsection D of this section is given, the department shall provide the municipality or county adequate opportunity to review an application for a claim for refund that gave rise to the recoverable amount, exclusive of any amended returns that may be attached to the application, pursuant to Section 7-1-8.9 NMSA 1978.\n\nG.

A decrease to or redirection of a distribution or transfer pursuant to this subsection that arose:\n\n(1) prior to an adjustment of a distribution or transfer of net receipts creating a recoverable amount owed to the department takes precedence over any collection of any recoverable amount pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of this section, which may be made only from the net amount of the distribution or transfer remaining after application of the decrease or redirection pursuant to this subsection; and\n\n(2) after an adjustment of a distribution or transfer of net receipts creating a recoverable amount owed to the department shall be subordinate to any collection of any recoverable amount pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of this section.\n\nI. Upon the direction of the secretary of finance and administration pursuant to Section 9-6-5.2 NMSA 1978, the secretary shall temporarily withhold the balance of a distribution to a municipality or county, net of any decrease or redirected amount pursuant to Subsection H of this section and any recoverable amount pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of this section, that has failed to submit an audit report required by the Audit Act [12-6-1 to 12-6-15 NMSA 1978] or a financial report required by Subsection F of Section 6-6-2 NMSA 1978. The amount to be withheld, the source of the withheld distribution and the number of months that the distribution is to be withheld shall be as directed by the secretary of finance and administration. A distribution withheld pursuant to this subsection shall remain in the tax administration suspense fund until distributed to the municipality or county and shall not be distributed to the general fund. An amount withheld pursuant to this subsection shall be distributed to the municipality or county upon direction of the secretary of finance and administration.\n\nJ.

The distribution authorized in this section shall be used for the following purposes:\n\n(1) reconstructing, resurfacing, maintaining, repairing or otherwise improving existing alleys, streets, roads or bridges, or any combination of the foregoing; or laying off, opening, constructing or otherwise acquiring new alleys, streets, roads or bridges, or any combination of the foregoing; provided that any of the foregoing improvements may include, but are not limited to, the acquisition of rights of way;\n\n(2) to provide matching funds for projects subject to cooperative agreements with the state highway and transportation department pursuant to Section 67-3-28 NMSA 1978; and\n\n(3) for expenses of purchasing, maintaining and operating transit operations and facilities, for the operation of a transit authority established by the municipal transit law and for the operation of a vehicle emission inspection program. A municipality may engage in the business of the transportation of passengers and property within the political subdivision by whatever means the municipality may decide and may acquire cars, trucks, motor buses and other equipment necessary for operating the business. A municipality may acquire land, erect buildings and equip the buildings with all the necessary machinery and facilities for the operation, maintenance, modification, repair and storage of the cars, trucks, motor buses and other equipment needed. A municipality may do all things necessary for the acquisition and the conduct of the business of public transportation.\n\nC.

Fifteen percent of the aggregate amount distributable under this section shall be referred to as the \"redistribution amount\". Beginning in August 1990, and each month thereafter, from the redistribution amount there shall be taken an amount sufficient to increase the computed distribution amount of every floor municipality to the floor amount. In the event that the redistribution amount is insufficient for this purpose, the computed distribution amount for each floor municipality shall be increased by an amount equal to the redistribution amount times a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference between the floor amount and the municipality's computed distribution amount and the denominator of which is the difference between the product of the floor amount multiplied by the number of floor municipalities and the total of the computed distribution amounts for all floor municipalities.\n\nF. If a balance remains after the redistribution amount has been reduced pursuant to Subsection E of this section, there shall be added to the computed distribution amount of each municipality that is neither a full distribution municipality nor a floor municipality an amount that equals the balance of the redistribution amount times a fraction, the numerator of which is the computed distribution amount of the municipality and the denominator of which is the sum of the computed distribution amounts of all municipalities that are neither full distribution municipalities nor floor municipalities.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 7-1-6.27, enacted by Laws 1991, ch. 9, § 20; 1992, ch. 55, § 6; 1993, ch. 357, § 6; 1994, ch. 5, § 11; 1995, ch. 6, § 7; 1999, ch. 212, § 3.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1991, ch. 9, § 20 repealed former 7-1-6.27 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1991, ch. 9, § 19 and enacted a new section, effective July 1, 1992.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Subsection A of Laws 1995, ch. 6, § 20 repealed 7-1-6.27 NMSA 1978, as enacted by Laws 1994, ch. 5, § 12, relating to distributions to municipalities for municipal roads and which was to become effective August 1, 1997, effective June 16, 1995.

The election provided by this subsection applies only to federal adjustments other than the distributive share of federal adjustments that must be included in the unitary business income of any direct or indirect corporate partner; provided that this can be reasonably determined, or federal adjustments resulting from an administrative adjustment request. A partnership making an election pursuant to this subsection shall:\n\n(1) file a completed federal adjustments report and notify the department that it is making the election pursuant to this subsection; and\n\n(2) pay an amount, determined as follows, in lieu of taxes owed by its direct and indirect taxable partners:\n\n(a) exclude from the total final federal adjustments the distributive share reported to a direct partner that is an exempt partner unless the adjustment represents unrelated business taxable income;\n\n(b) include only the portion of the total federal adjustment to distributive shares of partners taken into account pursuant to Section 6225(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code;\n\n(c) apportion and allocate the adjustments as provided by the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act as applied at the partnership level following any department regulations adopted for this purpose;\n\n(d) multiply the resulting amount by the highest tax rate provided by Section 7-2A-5 NMSA 1978; and\n\n(e) add to the amount calculated pursuant to Subparagraph (d) of this paragraph an amount of penalty and interest computed pursuant to the Tax Administration Act.\n\nH. In any action required or allowed to be taken pursuant to the Tax Administration Act with respect to the reporting of federal adjustments by a partnership, the state partnership representative for the reviewed year shall have the sole authority to act on behalf of the partnership, and the partnership's direct partners and indirect partners shall be bound by those actions. The state partnership representative is the partnership's federal partnership representative for the reviewed year, unless the partnership designates in writing another person as its state partnership representative; provided that the person meets any qualifications established by the department.\n\nI. Pursuant to procedures that may be adopted by the department, an audited partnership or tiered partner of that partnership may enter into an agreement with the department to utilize an alternative reporting and payment method, including applicable time requirements or any other provision pursuant to Subsections E through H of this section, if the audited partnership or tiered partner demonstrates that the requested method will reasonably provide for the reporting and payment of taxes, penalties and interest due pursuant to Subsections E through H of this section. Application for approval of an alternative reporting and payment method must be made by the audited partnership or tiered partner within the time for election as provided in Subsection G of this section, as appropriate.\n\nJ. An election made pursuant to Subsection G or I of this section is irrevocable, unless the department, in its discretion, determines otherwise. If properly reported and paid by the audited partnership or tiered partner, the amount determined in Paragraph (2) of Subsection G of this section, or similarly under an optional election pursuant to Subsection I of this section, will be treated as paid in lieu of taxes owed by its direct and indirect partners on the same final federal adjustments. The direct or indirect partners of the partnership that pays this in lieu of amount may not claim any deduction, credit or refund with respect to that amount.\n\nK. A taxpayer may make estimated payments of state tax expected to result from a pending audit by the internal revenue service prior to the final determination date, following the process prescribed by the department, and such payments will limit the accrual of further statutory interest on that amount.\n\nL. A taxpayer may claim an amount of state tax resulting from final net-negative federal adjustments as provided in Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978.\n\nM.

Except as provided in Subsection D of this section, any taxpayer to whom taxes have been assessed as provided in Section 7-1-17 NMSA 1978 or upon whom demand for payment has been made as provided in Section 7-1-63 NMSA 1978 who does not within ninety days after the date of assessment or demand for payment make payment of the undisputed amount, protest the assessment or demand for payment as provided by Section 7-1-24 NMSA 1978 or furnish security for payment as provided by Section 7-1-54 NMSA 1978 becomes a delinquent taxpayer and remains such until:\n\n(1) payment of the total amount of all such taxes is made;\n\n(2) security is furnished for payment; or\n\n(3) no part of the assessment remains unabated.\n\nB.

If the secretary or the secretary's delegate determines that a taxpayer is liable for taxes in excess of fifty dollars ($50.00) that are due and that have not been previously assessed to the taxpayer, the secretary or the secretary's delegate shall promptly assess the amount thereof to the taxpayer.\n\nB. Assessments of tax are effective:\n\n(1) when a return of a taxpayer is received by the department showing a liability for taxes;\n\n(2) when a document denominated \"notice of assessment of taxes\", issued in the name of the secretary, is mailed or delivered in person to the taxpayer against whom the liability for tax is asserted, stating the nature and amount of the taxes assertedly owed by the taxpayer to the state, demanding of the taxpayer the immediate payment of the taxes and briefly informing the taxpayer of the remedies available to the taxpayer; or\n\n(3) when an effective jeopardy assessment is made as provided in the Tax Administration Act.\n\nC. Any assessment of taxes or demand for payment made by the department is presumed to be correct.\n\nD. When taxes have been assessed to any taxpayer and remain unpaid, the secretary or the secretary's delegate may demand payment at any time except as provided otherwise by Section 7-1-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-13-32, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 248, § 20; 1969, ch. 32, § 1; 1978 Comp., § 7-1-17; 1979, ch. 144, § 16; 1992, ch. 55, § 11; 2007, ch. 45, § 1; 2023, ch. 36, § 1.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective July 1, 2023, raised the amount of tax liability requiring assessment by the secretary of taxation and revenue; and in Subsection A, after \"taxes in excess of\", deleted \"twenty-five dollars ($25.00)\" and added \"fifty dollars ($50.00)\".\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective January 1, 2008, in Subsection A, changed the minimum amount from $10.00 to $25.00.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective July 1, 1992, substituted \"secretary\" for \"director\" and \"department\" for \"division\" several times throughout the section, added \"except as provided otherwise by Section 7-1-19 NMSA 1978\" at the end of Subsection D, and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nAssessment of taxes effectivewhen effective jeopardy assessment is made as provided in the Tax Administration Act.Regents of N.M. Coll. of Agric. & Mechanic Arts v. Academy of Aviation, Inc., 1971-NMSC-087, 83 N.M. 86, 488 P.2d 343.\n\nAssessment upheld when statutes followed and no dispute of factual correctness.— Since the record showed the statutory provisions were followed and taxpayer presented no evidence tending to dispute the factual correctness of the assessments, assessment will be upheld.McConnell v. State ex rel. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-181, 83 N.M. 386, 492 P.2d 1003.\n\nPresumption of correctness applies when assessment delivered.— Once the notice of assessment of taxes is delivered to the taxpayer, the statutory presumption, of the correctness of the assessment, applies, and absent a showing of incorrectness by taxpayers, the audit and notice of assessment of taxes must stand.Torridge Corp. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-171, 84 N.M. 610, 506 P.2d 354, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 592, 506 P.2d 336 (1973).\n\nExemption strictly construed in favor of taxing authority.— There is a presumption that an assessment of gross receipts taxes is correct, and in order for the taxpayer to be successful, he must clearly overcome this presumption. Moreover, where an exemption is claimed, the exemption is strictly construed in favor of the taxing authority.Stohr v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-118, 90 N.M. 43, 559 P.2d 420, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 254, 561 P.2d 1347 (1977).\n\nPresumption applicable to penalty statute.— Presumption of correctness of this section also applies to penalty section (7-1-69 NMSA 1978).Tiffany Constr. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-127, 90 N.M. 16, 558 P.2d 1155, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 255, 561 P.2d 1348 (1977).\n\nBurden on protesting taxpayers to overcome presumption.— The burden is on taxpayers protesting assessment to overcome presumption that the bureau's (now department's) assessment is correct.Archuleta v. O'Cheskey, 1972-NMCA-165, 84 N.M. 428, 504 P.2d 638;Tipperary Corp. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078;Anaconda Co. v. Prop.

Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMCA-021, 133 N.M. 217, 62 P.3d 308.\n\nPresumption overcome when not supported by substantial evidence.— The assessment is presumed to be correct; the taxpayer may overcome the presumption of correctness of the assessment by presenting evidence and showing that the decision of the bureau (now department) is not supported by substantial evidence.Floyd & Berry Davis Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-143, 88 N.M. 576, 544 P.2d 291.\n\nProtesting taxpayer must dispute factual correctness to overcome presumption.— Since any assessment of taxes is presumed to be correct, the duty rested on the taxpayer to present evidence tending to dispute the factual correctness of the assessments and to overcome this presumption.Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 548 P.2d 70.\n\nPresumption may be overcome by disputing factual correctness.— The presumption of Subsection C need be overcome only by a taxpayer's disputing the factual correctness of an assessment. When the taxpayer challenged the interpretation of a county ordinance in its submitted memorandum of positions, the burden was properly shifted by the memorandum to the bureau (now department) to at least acknowledge the existence of the ordinance.Co-Con, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-134, 87 N.M. 118, 529 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232.\n\nNecessity of presenting evidence to rebut the presumption of correctness.— When the corporation contracted with an out-of-state buyer for the corporation to destroy munitions, it was entitled to the gross receipts deduction, and the hearing officer could not properly determine that use or delivery took place within the state without some affirmative evidence in the record to support that conclusion.TPL, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMSC-007, 133 N.M. 447, 64 P.3d 474.\n\nNo basis for overturning decision where taxpayer unprepared.— Since the record showed that hearing officer carefully advised taxpayer as to the statutory procedures and his rights in connection with hearing and it also showed the taxpayer did not come prepared for the hearing, taxpayer's claims that bureau (now department) should have given him opportunity to present his evidence at a later time and, although it was his burden to proceed, that he was denied the right to cross-examine a witness who was never called were based on taxpayer's lack of preparation and do not provide a basis for overturning the commissioner's (now secretary's) decision.McConnell v. State ex rel. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-181, 83 N.M. 386, 492 P.2d 1003.\n\nPresumption not overcome by contradictory evidence.— Evidence that the construction contract between the taxpayer, a contracting business and a corporation created a ceiling price was not compelling in view of the contradictory evidence as to the actual cost of the construction, and the presumption of correctness of the assessment of gross receipts tax was not overcome.Floyd & Berry Davis Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-143, 88 N.M. 576, 544 P.2d 291.\n\nPresumption not overcome since acceptable audit method used.— Since the \"test months\" method was used for audit of taxpayers whose records were destroyed by fire in order to determine gross receipts subject to tax, and since there was evidence that the \"test months\" method was acceptable practice, the presumption of correctness of the assessments was not overcome.Torridge Corp. v. Comm'r of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-171, 84 N.M. 610, 506 P.2d 354, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 592, 506 P.2d 336 (1973).\n\nEvidence of entitlement to a manufacturing deduction.— A biotechnology company whose expertise was in the diagnosis of genetic disorders that could be detected through the appearance of chromosomes, and who produced tangible objects that were provided to its customers, such as a written report of its experts' diagnosis and a laminated karyotype, which consisted of photographs of chromosomes that were numbered and pasted onto a piece of laminated cardboard, did not establish its entitlement to a manufacturing deduction, since the company could not identify any out-of-state purchases that would be subject to the compensating tax of products incorporated into its reports or laminated karyotypes. The department, whose assessment is assumed correct, had identified as subject to the compensating tax such items as microscopes, sinks, and furniture, which undoubtedly were not incorporated into the documents or laminated karyotypes.Vivigen, Inc. v. Minzner, 1994-NMCA-027, 117 N.M. 224, 870 P.2d 1382.\n\nPresumption overcome when no basis for assessments existed.— Since the undisputed evidence of no audit for a two-year period of no test for gross receipts for those years and of different under-reporting percentages for the audited period established an absence of any basis for the assessments for that period, such showing overcame the presumption that the assessments were correct.Torridge Corp. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-171, 84 N.M. 610, 506 P.2d 354, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 592, 506 P.2d 336 (1973).\n\nStandard of review on appeal.— Department's gross receipts tax assessment can only be reversed by the court of appeals if arbitrary, capricious, or there is an abuse of discretion, such that the assessment's not supported by substantial evidence or it is otherwise not in accordance with law.ITT Educ. Serv. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-078, 125 N.M. 244, 959 P.2d 969.\n\nStandard of review on appeal.— Any assessment of taxes by the taxation and revenue department is presumed to be correct and in protesting the assessment of taxes the taxpayer has the burden of proving the deductions were proper. In reviewing, courts will reverse the department's decision only if it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, otherwise not in accordance with law, or not supported by substantial evidence.Arco Materials, Inc. v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-062, 118 N.M. 12, 878 P.2d 330,rev'd on other grounds sub nom.Blaze Constr. Co. v.

Ed. 2d 216 (1995).\n\nPresumption overcome by showing that division (now department) failed to follow statutory provisions.— An assessment made by the bureau (now department) is presumptively correct. This presumption may be overcome by showing that the bureau (now department) failed to follow the statutory provisions contained in the Tax Administration Act.Regents of N.M.

      "text": "A. If the secretary or the secretary's delegate determines that, taking into account the facts and circumstances in Subsections F and G of this section, it is inequitable to hold a spouse liable for payment of all or part of any unpaid tax, assessment or other deficiency for a tax, the secretary may decline to bring an action or proceeding to collect such taxes from the spouse, including collection from the spouse's interest in community property.\n\nB. The secretary or the secretary's delegate may grant innocent spouse relief to a spouse who files a joint tax return and all or part of the spouse's portion of any overpayment was, or is expected to be, applied to the tax liability for which the spouse is not liable because the liability is determined to be separate debt, as defined in Subsection A of Section 40-3-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. If on review it is determined that the information relied on to make the innocent spouse relief determination was incorrect or fraudulent, the department may rescind the innocent spouse relief and proceed to collect the affected taxes from the spouse.\n\nD. Innocent spouse relief does not authorize the abatement of taxes or enforcement of any provisions of the Tax Administration Act against the taxpayer.\n\nE. A lien or levy imposed on a spouse or property of a spouse who qualifies for innocent spouse relief may be released as to taxes deemed inequitable to collect pursuant to this section.\n\nF. If the federal internal revenue service granted the spouse relief pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Section 6015, the spouse may request similar relief from the department on a form prescribed by the department, regardless of whether the spouse is a joint or separate filer for New Mexico income tax. The spouse shall provide a copy of the federal internal revenue service's determination with the request that the secretary or the secretary's delegate cease collection activity against the spouse to the extent relief was allowed by the federal internal revenue service. The department shall grant innocent spouse relief for the same tax periods and tax programs granted relief by the federal internal revenue service; provided that the request for relief is submitted on the form prescribed by the department. The secretary or the secretary's delegate may decline to pursue collection activity against a spouse while an application for relief is pending before the federal internal revenue service, but the failure to seek or obtain relief shall not preclude the secretary or secretary's delegate from declining to collect tax from a spouse when collection would be inequitable. An item giving rise to a deficiency on a joint return shall be allocated to an individual filing the return in the same manner as it would have been allocated if the individual had filed separate returns for the taxable year.\n\nG. The secretary or the secretary's delegate shall consider at least the following facts and circumstances when determining whether to grant innocent spouse relief if the federal internal revenue service has not granted the spouse personal income tax relief pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Section 6015:\n\n(1) whether the spouse had knowledge of the tax liability at the time the liability arose;\n\n(2) whether the spouse had a meaningful opportunity to contest the assessment of tax at the time the assessment was made;\n\n(3) whether the spouse cooperated with the department in collection and compliance efforts, to the extent the spouse had knowledge of collection and compliance efforts;\n\n(4) whether the state can protect its interests without pursuing active collection efforts against the spouse, including collection efforts against the taxpayer;\n\n(5) whether the spouse benefited from the transfer of income, receipts or significant amounts of property from the taxpayer;\n\n(6) whether the spouse participated in the business and financial decisions of the household during the periods when the tax liability arose;\n\n(7) whether the spouse participated in operating a business with the taxpayer;\n\n(8) whether the spouse had responsibility for the finances of a business for which the spouse participated;\n\n(9) whether the spouse had responsibility for payment of taxes for a business for which the spouse participated; and\n\n(10) whether the spouse knew that the taxpayer engaged in business.\n\nH. No one factor contemplated to Subsection G of this section shall be considered determinative in considering whether tax collection from a spouse would be inequitable. Each factor may be given different relative weight, depending on the facts and circumstances presented; therefore, the presence of a majority of factors considered tending to support innocent spouse relief in a particular case may not necessarily indicate that the spouse in question qualifies for innocent spouse relief for New Mexico tax purposes.\n\nI. The secretary shall adopt and promulgate regulations as necessary for making the determinations pursuant to this section.\n\nJ. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"innocent spouse relief\" means the relief from collection of tax liabilities pursuant to this section;\n\n(2) \"spouse\" means a current or former spouse of a taxpayer; and\n\n(3) \"taxpayer\" means a taxpayer who is or was married to a spouse who is seeking innocent spouse relief pursuant to this section.\n\nHistory:Laws 2003, ch. 398, § 15; 2021, ch. 65, § 3.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective July 1, 2021, clarified provisions related to innocent spouse tax relief, required the taxation and revenue department to grant innocent spouse relief in instances where the IRS has already granted a taxpayer innocent spouse relief for the same tax period, provided factors that the secretary of the taxation and revenue department must consider when determining whether to grant innocent spouse relief if the IRS has not granted the spouse personal income tax relief; in Subsection A, after \"secretary\", added \"or the secretary's delegate\", after \"facts and circumstances\", added \"in Subsections F and G of this section\", after the first occurrence of \"spouse\", deleted \"or former spouse of a taxpayer\", after \"deficiency for a tax\", deleted \"administered under the Tax Administration Act\", after \"proceeding to collet such taxes\", deleted \"against the spouse or former spouse of the taxpayer\"; deleted former subsection designation \"B.\" and the language \"Nothing in Subsection A of this section shall be construed to\" and added \"from the spouse, including collection from the spouse's interest in community property\"; added new Subsections B through H and redesignated former Subsection C as Subsection I; and added Subsection J.",

In case of a false or fraudulent return made by a taxpayer with intent to evade tax, the amount thereof may be assessed at any time within ten years from the end of the calendar year in which the tax was due, and no proceeding in court for the collection of such tax without the prior assessment thereof shall be begun after the expiration of such period.\n\nC. In case of the failure by a taxpayer to complete and file any required return, the tax relating to the period for which the return was required may be assessed at any time within seven years from the end of the calendar year in which the tax was due, and no proceeding in court for the collection of such tax without the prior assessment thereof shall be begun after the expiration of such period.\n\nD. If a taxpayer in a return understates by more than twenty-five percent the amount of liability for any tax for the period to which the return relates, appropriate assessments may be made by the department at any time within six years from the end of the calendar year in which payment of the tax was due.\n\nE. If any adjustment in the basis for computation of any federal tax is made as a result of an audit by the internal revenue service or the filing of an amended federal return or administrative adjustment request changing a prior election or making any other change for which federal approval is required by the Internal Revenue Code that results in liability for any tax, the amount thereof may be assessed at any time, but not after three years from the end of the calendar year in which filing of a federal adjustments report is required by Subsections E through J of Section 7-1-13 NMSA 1978.\n\nF. If the taxpayer has signed a waiver of the limitations on assessment imposed by this section, an assessment of tax may be made or a proceeding in court begun without regard to the time at which payment of the tax was due.\n\nG. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"administrative adjustment request\" means \"administrative adjustment request\" as used in Section 7-1-13 NMSA 1978; and\n\n(2) \"federal adjustments report\" means \"federal adjustments report\" as used in Section 7-1-13 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-13-33, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 248, § 21; 1970, ch. 18, § 1; 1979, ch. 144, § 17; 1983, ch. 211, § 26; 1993, ch. 5, § 7; 1994, ch. 51, § 4; 2013, ch. 27, § 3; 2021, ch. 83, § 2.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective June 18, 2021, amended sections of the tax administration act to address federal partnership audit or adjustment requests resulting in underpayment or overpayment of state taxes, and defined terms as used in this section; in Subsection E, after \"an amended federal return\", added \"or administrative adjustment request\", after \"filing of\", deleted \"an amended return\" and added \"a federal adjustment report\", and after \"required by\", changed \"Subsection C\" to \"Subsection E through J\"; and added Subsection G.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective July 1, 2013, permitted an assessment if an Internal Revenue Service audit or change in a return that required Internal Revenue Service approval results in tax liability; in Subsection E, added the language between \"computation of any federal tax is made\" and \"that results in liability for any tax\".\n\nThe 1994 amendment,effective July 1, 1994, substituted the language at the end of Subsection E, beginning with \"three years\", for \"one year after the date of the receipt of the amended return or not after the end of the period limited by Subsection A of this section, whichever is later\".\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, substituted \"department\" for \"director\" in the catchline and in Subsection D and for \"director or his delegate\" in Subsection A, and made a minor stylistic change in Subsection E.\n\nExtension of limitations period.— The taxation and revenue department is required to extend the general three-year limitation on assessments to six years when making an assessment if a taxpayer underreported taxes in excess of 25 percent, and the principles of estoppel do not affect the department's application of the longer period.Taxation & Revenue Dep't v. Bien Mur Indian Mkt. Ctr., Inc., 1989-NMSC-015, 108 N.M. 228, 770 P.2d 873.\n\nSeven-year statute of limitation applied where taxpayers failed to file returns.— Where taxpayers appealed a 2018 assessment of taxes for tax years 2008 through 2011, arising from the operation of an automotive technician business, and where defendant argued that the administrative hearing officer incorrectly applied a ten-year, rather than a seven-year statute of limitations to their failure to file gross receipts tax returns for 2008, 2009, and 2010, the hearing officer erred in finding that taxpayers filed fraudulent returns and applying the ten-year statute of limitation to the assessments, because although taxpayers filed federal and pass-through entities (PTE) returns for the years 2008, 2009, and 2010, the evidence did not demonstrate that the filed federal and PTE returns were false or fraudulent, and the hearing officer explicitly found that taxpayers did not file state gross receipts tax returns for the years 2008, 2009, and 2010. The seven-year limitation period found in § 7-1-18(C) NMSA 1978, relating to the failure to file a return, applied to the facts of this case and barred the taxation and revenue department from assessing taxpayers personally for the years 2008, 2009, and 2010.Vigil v. N.M. Tax'n and Revenue Dep't, 2022-NMCA-032.\n\nAssessment of severance taxes was not barred.— Where taxpayer was party to a settlement agreement that was approved by a federal district court in a class action involving the underpayment of royalties on the production of carbon dioxide gas; the settlement agreement constituted an order that increased the value of the carbon dioxide gas previously reported by taxpayer and constituted a taxable event under Section 7-29-4.3 NMSA 1978; taxpayer did not prepare or file any tax returns that reported any of the settlement proceeds paid by taxpayer to royalty interest owners as additional amounts subject to severance tax liability; the settlement agreement was approved in 1998; and a severance tax assessment was issued in 2004, the assessment was not barred by the statute of limitations.Hess Corp. v.

Taxpayers were not required to pursue the same remedy for the denial of the 2016 credits as they pursued for the denial of the 2015 credits; the act requires only that a taxpayer exhaust whatever remedy it has chosen to challenge the denial of a given credit.Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems v. Clarke, 2021-NMCA-065.\n\nDoctrine of vicarious or virtual exhaustion of remedies does not apply.— The Tax Administration Act provides the exclusive remedies for tax refunds and requires taxpayers to individually seek a refund. Each member of the class of taxpayers challenging the constitutionality of a tax must individually exhaust their administrative remedies and only after individual exhaustion by each class member can the district court have jurisdiction over the class. The doctrine of vicarious or virtual exhaustion of remedies that allows a class action for tax refunds to proceed when only a few members of the proposed class have exhausted their administrative remedies does not apply to proceedings under the Tax Administration Act.U.S. Xpress v.

A taxpayer may dispute:\n\n(1) the assessment to the taxpayer of any amount of tax over fifty dollars ($50.00);\n\n(2) the application to the taxpayer of any provision of the Tax Administration Act except the issuance of a subpoena or summons; or\n\n(3) the denial of or failure either to allow or to deny a:\n\n(a) credit or rebate; or\n\n(b) claim for refund made in accordance with Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. The taxpayer may dispute a matter described in Subsection A of this section by filing with the secretary a written protest that:\n\n(1) identifies the taxpayer and the tax credit, rebate, property or provision of the Tax Administration Act involved;\n\n(2) states the grounds on which the protest is based and summarizes evidence supporting each ground asserted; and\n\n(3) states the affirmative relief requested.\n\nC. A taxpayer may amend a statement made by the taxpayer in accordance with Paragraphs (2) and (3) of Subsection B of this section at any time prior to ten days before the hearing conducted on the protest in accordance with the Administrative Hearings Office Act [Chapter 7, Article 1B NMSA 1978] or, if a scheduling order has been issued, in accordance with the scheduling order. The secretary may, in appropriate cases, provide for an informal conference before a hearing of the protest is set by the administrative hearings office or before acting on a claim for refund.\n\nD. A taxpayer may file a protest, in the case of an assessment of tax by the department, without making payment of the amount assessed; provided that, if only a portion of the assessment is in dispute, any unprotested amounts of tax, interest or penalty shall be paid, or, if applicable, an installment agreement pursuant to Section 7-1-21 NMSA 1978 shall be entered into for the unprotested amounts, on or before the due date for the protest.\n\nE. A protest by a taxpayer shall be filed within ninety days after:\n\n(1) the date of the mailing to the taxpayer by the department of the notice of assessment and demand for payment as provided in Subsection A or D of Section 7-1-17 NMSA 1978;\n\n(2) the mailing of the other peremptory notice or demand;\n\n(3) the date of the application to the taxpayer of the applicable provision of the Tax Administration Act; or\n\n(4) the date of denial of a claim pursuant to Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978 or the last date upon which the department was required to take action on the claim but failed to take action.\n\nF. If a taxpayer fails to timely protest an assessment of tax, penalty or interest:\n\n(1) the undisputed amount of tax assessed and not protested becomes final;\n\n(2) the taxpayer is deemed to have waived the right to protest the assessment, unless the taxpayer pays the tax and claims a refund of the tax pursuant to Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978; and\n\n(3) the secretary may proceed to enforce collection of the tax if the taxpayer is delinquent as defined by Section 7-1-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nG. The fact that the department did not mail the assessment or other peremptory notice or demand by certified or registered mail or otherwise demand and receive acknowledgment of receipt by the taxpayer shall not be deemed to demonstrate the taxpayer's inability to protest within the required time.\n\nH. A proceeding other than one to enforce collection of an amount assessed as tax and to protect the interest of the state by injunction, as provided by Sections 7-1-31, 7-1-33, 7-1-34, 7-1-40, 7-1-53, 7-1-56 and 7-1-58 NMSA 1978, is not stayed by timely filing of a protest in accordance with this section.\n\nI.

or\n\nB. on or after July 1, 2013, if the date of mailing or service of process, application of the applicable provision of the Tax Administration Act, denial or failure to deny or allow with the time prescribed occurred on or after June 2, 2013.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, substituted \"D\" for \"E\" following \"pursuant to Subsection\" near the end of Subsection A;

and added Subsection K and redesignated former Subsection I as present Subsection L.\n\nThe 2000 amendment,effective July 1, 2000, in Subsection A, deleted \"or taxes\" following \"shall identify the taxpayer and the tax\" in the second sentence and specified that a taxpayer has until ten days before the hearing to supplement his statement of grounds for protest or, if a scheduling order has been issued, must act in accordance with the scheduling order;

and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nEstablished procedural framework for tax protest proceedings.— Under the Tax Administration Act, a tax assessment is presumed to be correct; a taxpayer can attempt to overcome this presumption of correctness by coming forward with some countervailing evidence tending to dispute the factual correctness of the assessment, and if the taxpayer overcomes the presumption, the burden shifts to the department to demonstrate the correctness of the tax assessment. The burden of proof during an administrative hearing on a tax protest is preponderance of evidence.Gemini Las Colinas, LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-039.\n\nOvercoming the presumption of correctness.— To overcome the presumption of correctness of a tax assessment, the taxpayer need not prove, by a preponderance of evidence or otherwise, that the tax assessment performed by the department is incorrect; instead, to rebut the presumption, the taxpayer need only come forward with some countervailing evidence that tends to dispute the assessment, but unsubstantiated statements that the assessment is incorrect do not suffice to overcome the presumption. Determining whether the taxpayer has overcome the presumption of correctness is the first step in resolving a tax protest, and it will only be the last step if the taxpayer fails to overcome the presumption.Gemini Las Colinas, LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-039.\n\nDepartment's burden of showing the correctness of a tax assessment.— If a taxpayer has overcome the presumption of correctness of a tax assessment, the burden that shifts to the department is a burden of production; to overcome this burden the department must put forth evidence to show the correctness of its assessment, that is, evidence sufficient to make the correctness of the department's assessment a question of fact. The burden of persuasion remains with the taxpayer throughout the proceedings.Gemini Las Colinas, LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-039.\n\nAdministrative hearing officer erred by applying the statutory presumption of correctness in a manner contrary to law.— Where the Department of Taxation and Revenue (Department) audited taxpayer, the owner and operator of an independent living facility that rents apartment to people fifty-five years and older, and where the department concluded that taxpayer had been overstating certain deductions for its gross receipts tax liability, and where taxpayer protested, claiming that the department incorrectly determined the rental value and, consequently, assessed taxes in an amount greater than taxpayer's actual liability, and where the administrative hearing officer (AHO) denied taxpayer's protest, holding that \"the taxpayer did not prove by a preponderance of evidence that the method actually employed by the Department resulted in an incorrect assessment,\" and that \"taxpayer did not overcome the presumption of correctness that attached to the assessment,\" the AHO erred in denying taxpayer's protest, because the AHO sought a preponderance of evidence to overcome the statutory presumption of correctness, and this evidentiary standard was not in accordance with the law. A protesting taxpayer overcomes the presumption of correctness by presenting some countervailing evidence tending to dispute the factual correctness of the assessment.Gemini Las Colinas, LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-039.\n\nDisputing the denial of an application for a high-wage jobs tax credit.— Where taxpayer submitted an application for a high-wage jobs tax credit, which was denied by the Department of Taxation and Revenue (Department), and where taxpayer did not file a written protest to the department's denial of its credit application, pursuant to 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but rather filed an application for refund pursuant to 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, based on its original credit application, which was also denied by the department, and where taxpayer filed a written protest to the denial of its refund application, and where, following multiple hearings before the administrative hearing officer, the department filed a motion for summary judgment, and where the administrative hearing officer granted the department's motion, concluding that the only available remedy for a denial of an application for a tax credit was to file a protest within ninety days of the denial pursuant to 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, and that taxpayer's failure to file such a protest rendered the department's denial indisputable, the administrative hearing officer erred in granting the department's motion for summary judgment and denying taxpayer's protest, because neither the applicable statutes nor the department's own guidance suggest that a taxpayer's sole remedy to dispute the denial of a high-wage jobs tax credit is through the protest procedures provided in 7-1-24 NMSA 1978. The plain language of both 7-1-24 and 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, indicates that the two statutes exist as alternatives and a taxpayer may dispute a denial of a tax credit under either statute.Gemini Las Colinas, LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-039.\n\nClaims for refund.— Subsection B of this section does not mention claims for refund.Kilmer v. Goodwin, 2004-NMCA-122, 136 N.M. 440, 99 P.3d 690.\n\nDefects in proceedings.— The hearing officer's failure to take an oath or obtain a faithful performance bond; the failure of the hearing officer to submit a written request to the IRS for federal tax information as provided in 26 U.S.C. §6103(d)(1); the reliance by the hearing officer on the IRS Income Tax Examination Changes; and the lack of a valid control number on applicable tax forms as provided in the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S. C. §§ 3501 to 3520, do not affect the taxpayer's tax liability or absolve the taxpayer of liability.Stockton v. N.M. Taxation and Revenue Dept., 2007-NMCA-071, 141 N.M. 860, 161 P.3d 905.\n\nAppealable final order.— Hearing officer's order dismissing taxpayer's appeal was not an appealable final order, since it had not been approved or signed by the secretary of taxation and revenue.Harris v. Revenue Div. of Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1987-NMCA-034, 105 N.M. 721, 737 P.2d 80 (decided under prior law).\n\nTax Administration Act requires exhaustion of remedies for each denial of a given credit.— Where plaintiff taxpayers (taxpayers) twice challenged the New Mexico taxation and revenue department's (department) denial of applications for high wage jobs tax credits, once in 2015 and again in 2016, and where taxpayers elected to dispute the denial of the 2015 credits by filing a written protest to be heard by the department's administrative hearing officer (AHO), pursuant to § 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but elected to protest the denial of the 2016 credits by claiming a refund from the department for the credit denied, pursuant to § 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, and where the department filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that when a taxpayer pursues successive denials of tax credits raising a common issue, the taxpayer must have the issue resolved in the forum where it was initially raised or is otherwise bound by their choice of remedy for the original denial, the district court erred in granting the department's motion for summary judgment, because the Tax Administration Act, §§ 7-1-1 to 7-1-83 NMSA 1978, requires only that a taxpayer denied a given credit exhaust their remedy for that denied credit before seeking relief from the courts. Taxpayers were not required to pursue the same remedy for the denial of the 2016 credits as they pursued for the denial of the 2015 credits; the Act requires only that a taxpayer exhaust whatever remedy it has chosen to challenge the denial of a given credit.Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems v. Clarke, 2021-NMCA-065.\n\nDistrict court erred in invoking primary jurisdiction.— Where plaintiff taxpayers (taxpayers) twice challenged the New Mexico taxation and revenue department's (department) denial of applications for high wage jobs tax credits, once in 2015 and again in 2016, and where taxpayers elected to dispute the denial of the 2015 credits by filing a written protest to be heard by the department's administrative hearing officer (AHO), pursuant to § 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but elected to protest the denial of the 2016 credits by claiming a refund from the department for the credit denied, pursuant to § 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, and where the department filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that when a taxpayer pursues successive denials of tax credits raising a common issue, the taxpayer must have the issue resolved in the forum where it was initially raised or is otherwise bound by their choice of remedy for the original denial, the district court erred in granting the department's motion for summary judgment, invoking the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, because in this case, taxpayers exhausted their administrative remedies as to the 2016 credits, thereby depriving the AHO of jurisdiction, the department failed to explain why resolution of specific, factual issues raised in the 2016 credits require the peculiar expertise of the AHO, and the remedy requested by the department, entry of judgment in its favor, is not one available under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems v. Clarke, 2021-NMCA-065.\n\nNo abatement of assessment for lack of prompt hearing.— Assessments are not abated merely because taxpayers were not given prompt hearing on protests.In re Ranchers-Tufco Limestone Project Joint Venture, 1983-NMCA-126, 100 N.M. 632, 674 P.2d 522, cert denied, 100 N.M. 506, 672 P.2d 1136.\n\nThirty-day requirement for hearing officer decisiondoes not affect \"the essential power\" of the hearing officer to decide complex and time-consuming tax protests.Kmart Props., Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2006-NMCA-026, 139 N.M. 177, 131 P.3d 27,rev'd on other grounds,Kmart Corp. v. N.M. Taxation and Revenue Dep't, 2006-NMSC-006, 139 N.M. 172, 131 P.3d 22.\n\nTaxpayer appearing alone does so at own peril.— Taxpayer has a right to appear by himself or by an attorney or an accountant, but if he chose to appear alone, he appeared at his own peril.McConnell v. State ex rel. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-181, 83 N.M. 386, 492 P.2d 1003.\n\nHearing officer need not assume duties of counsel at second hearing.— Since taxpayer's rights were amply protected at the first hearing, and the second hearing was a continuation of the first, at which the only issue was taxpayer's duty to secure additional proof that its sales were nontaxable transactions, taxpayer was granted a full and fair hearing, at which he voluntarily and willingly waived his right to counsel, and the hearing officer was not required to assume the duties of counsel for taxpayer at the second hearing.Al Zuni Traders v. Bureau of Revenue, 1977-NMCA-025, 90 N.M. 258, 561 P.2d 1351.\n\nTaxpayer must establish timely filing.— Where a taxpayer failed to establish that he filed a protest of an audit by the taxation and revenue department within 30 days of notice, as required by this section, the issue of an improper audit was not before the hearing officer.Lopez v. N.M. Dep't of Taxation & Revenue, 1997-NMCA-115, 124 N.M. 270, 949 P.2d 284, cert. denied, 124 N.M. 311, 950 P.2d 284.\n\nDecision upheld when arguments based on taxpayer's unpreparedness.— Since the record showed that hearing officer carefully advised taxpayer as to the statutory procedures and his rights in connection with hearing and it also showed the taxpayer did not come prepared for the hearing, taxpayer's claims that revenue bureau (department) should have given him opportunity to present his evidence at a later time and, although it was his burden to proceed, that he was denied the right to cross-examine a witness who was never called were based on taxpayer's lack of preparation and do not provide a basis for overturning the commissioner's (hearing officer's) decision.McConnell v. State ex rel. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-181, 83 N.M. 386, 492 P.2d 1003.\n\nTechnical rules of evidence do not applyin hearings before the commissioner (hearing officer) and as the oral evidence provided reasonable substantiation of the documents, they were properly admitted.Garfield Mines Ltd. v. O'Cheskey, 1973-NMCA-128, 85 N.M. 547, 514 P.2d 304.\n\nEvidential rules governing weight, applicability or materiality not limited.— The rules governing the admissibility of evidence before administrative boards are frequently relaxed to expedite administrative procedure but the rules relating to weight, applicability or materiality of evidence are not thus limited.Eaton v. Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-114, 84 N.M. 226, 501 P.2d 670, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 219, 501 P.2d 663.\n\nDirector (hearing officer) has no authority to catalogue which evidence considered.— The state has not given to the commissioner (hearing officer) authority to catalogue which evidence shall be considered in determining a taxpayer's employment status.Eaton v. Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-114, 84 N.M. 226, 501 P.2d 670, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 219, 501 P.2d 663.\n\nIf testimony based on supposition, Subsection H not satisfied.— Since taxpayer's books and records are not adequate to permit an accurate computation of the state tax, and his testimony is based on supposition and guess, he does not satisfy the requirements of Subsection H.Archuleta v. O'Cheskey, 1972-NMCA-165, 84 N.M. 428, 504 P.2d 638.\n\nRuling reversed if director (hearing officer) failed to consider all evidence.— Since the commissioner (hearing officer), before arriving at a decision, did not consider all of the evidence presented at the hearing but only that pertaining to the \"indicia\" under G.R. Regulation 12.5:1 (3.2.105.7 NMAC), the court could not say that he would have reached the same conclusion had all of \"the evidence presented and admitted\" been considered, as required by Subsection G (Subsection I), and, therefore, held the ruling reversed for arbitrariness.Eaton v. Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-114, 84 N.M. 226, 501 P.2d 670, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 219, 501 P.2d 663.\n\nEvidence presented after hearing.— Where the taxpayer's alternative theory for a deduction was raised in the taxpayer's formal protest; the issue was not set forth in the prehearing statement of issues; and the taxpayer failed to tender any evidence on the issue at the hearing, the hearing officer did abuse the officer's discretion by refusing to consider evidence tendered by the taxpayer in a post-hearing brief forty days after the hearing.TPL, Inc. v.

      "text": "A. If the protestant or secretary is dissatisfied with the decision and order of the hearing officer, the party may appeal to the court of appeals for further relief, but only to the same extent and upon the same theory as was asserted in the hearing before the hearing officer. All such appeals shall be upon the record made at the hearing and shall not be de novo. All such appeals to the court of appeals shall be taken within thirty days of the date of mailing or delivery of the written decision and order of the hearing officer to the protestant, and, if not so taken, the decision and order are conclusive.\n\nB. The procedure for perfecting an appeal under this section to the court of appeals shall be as provided by the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\nC. Upon appeal, the court shall set aside a decision and order of the hearing officer only if found to be:\n\n(1) arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion;\n\n(2) not supported by substantial evidence in the record; or\n\n(3) otherwise not in accordance with the law.\n\nD. If the secretary appeals a decision of the hearing officer and the court's decision, from which either no appeal is taken or no appeal may be taken, upholds the decision of the hearing officer, the court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the protestant. If the decision upholds the hearing officer's decision only in part, the award shall be limited to reasonable attorney fees associated with the portion upheld.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-13-39, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 248, § 27; 1966, ch. 30, § 3; 1973, ch. 167, § 1; 1979, ch. 144, § 24; 1985, ch. 65, § 15; 1986, ch. 20, § 16; 1989, ch. 325, § 7; 2015, ch. 73, § 16.\n\nCross references.— For Rules of Appellate Procedure,seeRule 12-101 NMRA et seq.\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective July 1, 2015, provided for appeals from hearing officers' decisions; in the catchline, after \"Appeals from\", deleted \"secretary's\" and added \"hearing officer's\"; and in Subsection D, after \"shall award reasonable\", deleted \"attorney's\" and added \"attorney\", and after \"limited to reasonable\" deleted \"attorney's\" and added \"attorney\".\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2015, ch. 73, § 36 provided:\n\nA. On July 1, 2015, all personnel, functions, appropriations, money, records, furniture, equipment and other property of, or attributable to, the hearings bureau of the office of the secretary of taxation and revenue shall be transferred to the administrative hearings office.\n\nB.

On July 1, 2015, all references in statute to the hearings bureau of the office of the secretary of taxation and revenue or hearing officers of the taxation and revenue department in Chapters 7 and 66 NMSA 1978 shall be deemed to be references to the administrative hearings office or a hearing officer of the office.\n\nD. Rules of the taxation and revenue department pertaining to hearing officers and the conduct of hearings pursuant to actions related to Chapter 7 or 66 NMSA 1978 shall be deemed to be the rules of the administrative hearings office until amended or repealed by the office.\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective June 16, 1989, in Subsection A, substituted \"protestant or secretary\" for \"protestant or claimant\" and \"the hearing officer, the party\" for \"the secretary, the protestant or claimant\" in the first sentence and \"the hearing officer to the protestant\" for \"the secretary to the protestant, or claimant\" in the last sentence of the subsection; substituted present Subsection B for the provisions of former Subsections B and C, specifying the procedure for perfecting an appeal under this section; redesignated former Subsection D as present Subsection C, substituting \"hearing officer\" for \"secretary\" near the beginning; and added present Subsection D.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nSection grants court of appeals jurisdiction to review director's ( hearing officer's) decisions.— Court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to review decisions of the commissioner (hearing officer) under the Administrative Procedures Act (12-8-1 to 12-8-25 NMSA 1978), but does have jurisdiction to review such decisions under this section of the Tax Administration Act.Westland Corp. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-083, 83 N.M. 29, 487 P.2d 1099, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 22, 487 P.2d 1092.\n\nScope of jurisdiction.— The court of appeals has jurisdiction in appeals from a hearing officer's decision and order whether the issues are deemed to arise out of a claim for refund or out of the protest of an assessment.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Revenue Div., Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1981-NMCA-042, 96 N.M. 117, 628 P.2d 687, cert. denied, 96 N.M. 116, 628 P.2d 686.\n\nUntimely notice of appeal.— Where taxpayer protested an assessment of tax by the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department) on gross receipts for commissions earned on the sale of implantable prosthetic devices, and where the hearing officer filed his decision and order in favor of taxpayer, finding that taxpayer's commissions were not subject to the gross receipts tax, and where the hearing officer denied the department's motion for reconsideration, which was filed fifteen days after the hearing officer's decision, and where the department filed its notice of appeal twenty-three days after denial of its motion for reconsideration and thirty-eight days after the filing of the hearing officer's decision and order, the department's appeal was untimely because this section unambiguously requires that appeals be taken within thirty days of the hearing officer's decision and order, and nothing in this section allows for the tolling of the period for filing a notice of appeal.In re Gelinas, 2020-NMCA-038, cert. denied.\n\nII. APPEAL.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nRecord must indicate reasoning and basis of denial of protest.— Although the commissioner (hearing officer) is not required to make formal findings of fact and conclusions of law, the record presented to the court for review must indicate his reasoning and the basis on which he denied the taxpayer's protest and in the absence of this matter must be remanded for further proceedings.Title Servs., Inc. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-014, 86 N.M. 128, 520 P.2d 284.\n\nMeaning of \"claimant\" and \"taxpayer\".— The court of appeals had no jurisdiction over the appeal of an Indian tribe which had been denied the right to intervene in a protest brought by a construction company over assessment of gross receipts tax on receipts under a contract between the tribe and the company, despite the fact that contractual indemnity provisions would ultimately render the tribe liable to the company for any tax due; the tribe was not a \"claimant,\" (term \"claimant\" no longer in statute) since no taxes had yet been paid, and was not a \"taxpayer\" since the taxes were assessed not to it but to the company.Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-130, 88 N.M. 525, 543 P.2d 493, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 206, 549 P.2d 284 (1976).\n\n\"Unjust enrichment\".— A hearing officer acted in a manner inconsistent with the law in weighing additional equitable factors beyond those required by the doctrine of equitable recoupment, thereby undercutting the required factors, where taxpayer paid correct amount of tax but mistakenly did so as a compensating use, not gross receipts, tax.Teco Invs., Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-055, 125 N.M. 103, 957 P.2d 532.\n\nB. ISSUE AT HEARING.\n\nWaiver of issues.— The taxation and revenue department waived the issue whether the taxpayer failed to properly pursue its remedies under the Tax Administration Act by not raising the issue prior to appeal.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Revenue Div., Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1981-NMCA-042, 96 N.M. 117, 628 P.2d 687, cert. denied, 96 N.M. 116, 628 P.2d 686.\n\nIssue not raised at hearing cannot be heard on appeal.— The appeal to a court of appeals from the commissioner's (hearing officer's) decision is on the record made at the hearing. If the record does not show an issue was raised at the hearing, this issue is not before the appellate court for review.Till v. Jones, 1972-NMCA-046, 83 N.M. 743, 497 P.2d 745, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 740, 497 P.2d 742.\n\nIf an issue is not raised at the formal hearing, it is not an issue in the appeal.In re Ranchers-Tufco Limestone Project Joint Venture, 1983-NMCA-126, 100 N.M. 632, 674 P.2d 522, cert. denied, 100 N.M. 505, 672 P2d 1136.\n\nAppeal to same extent and upon same theory as hearing.— This section provides that the appeal to an appellate court is only to the same extent and upon the same theory as was asserted in the hearing.N.M. Sheriffs & Police Ass'n v. Bureau of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-130, 85 N.M. 565, 514 P.2d 616.\n\nA party will not be permitted to change his theory of a case on appeal, thus precluding from consideration questions or issues which were not raised at the hearing.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Revenue Div., 1981-NMCA-042, 96 N.M. 117, 628 P.2d 687, cert. denied, 96 N.M. 116, 628 P.2d 686.\n\nAudit items not protested or issue in hearing not reviewable.— Since the appellant did not protest items included in audit and these items were not an issue at the hearing, appellant may not challenge, in the court of appeals, the sufficiency of the evidence as to receipts from these items when they were not an issue in the hearing because this section authorizes appeals to this court only to the same extent and upon the same theory as was asserted in the hearing before the commissioner (hearing officer).Archuleta v. O'Cheskey, 1972-NMCA-165, 84 N.M. 428, 504 P.2d 638.\n\nArguments not raised at hearing not reviewable.— The taxpayer did not raise the argument before the bureau (hearing officer) that the base figure for the gross receipts tax was not correct and therefore it need not be considered on appeal.Floyd & Berry Davis Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-143, 88 N.M. 576, 544 P.2d 291.\n\nIII. RECORD.\n\nQuestion of law not binding but inference from facts conclusive.— As all facts before the commissioner (hearing officer) and relating to both questions were stipulated, accordingly, if but one inference can reasonably be drawn from the stipulated facts, a question of law is presented and a finding of the commissioner (hearing officer) to the contrary is not binding on the reviewing court. If, however, more than one inference can reasonably be drawn, then the finding of the commissioner (hearing officer) is conclusive.Rust Tractor Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-107, 82 N.M. 82, 475 P.2d 779, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778;Rock v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-012, 83 N.M. 478, 493 P.2d 963.\n\nIV. GROUNDS FOR REVERSAL.\n\nA. ARBITRARY.\n\nIf Paragraphs (2) and (3) of Subsection D (now Subsection C) are satisfied, then Paragraph (1) satisfied.— Since the order was supported by substantial evidence and was in accordance with applicable law, it was neither arbitrary nor capricious and its entry was not an abuse of discretion.Union Cnty. Feedlot, Inc. v. Vigil, 1968-NMCA-088, 79 N.M. 684, 448 P.2d 485.\n\nDouble taxationis not necessarily arbitrary or capricious.N.M. Sheriffs & Police Ass'n v. Bureau of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-130, 85 N.M. 565, 514 P.2d 616.\n\n\"Income\".— The New Mexico taxation and revenue department's determination of the taxpayers' tax liability was not arbitrary and capricious; the taxpayers' arguments that their wages from their employment were not \"income\" were frivolous and without any legal support.Holt v. N.M. Dep't of Taxation & Revenue, 2002-NMSC-034, 133 N.M. 11, 59 P.3d 491.\n\nRuling arbitrary if all evidence not considered.— Since the commissioner (hearing officer), before arriving at a decision, did not consider all of the evidence presented at the hearing but only that pertaining to the \"indicia\" under G.R. Regulation 12.5:1 (3.2.105.7 NMAC), the court could not say that the commissioner (hearing officer) would have reached the same conclusion had all of \"the evidence presented and admitted\" been considered as required by Section 7-1-24G NMSA 1978 (now Section 7-1-24(I) NMSA 1978), and therefore held the ruling reversed for arbitrariness.Eaton v. Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-114, 84 N.M. 226, 501 P.2d 670, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 219, 501 P.2d 663.\n\nB. SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.\n\nEvidence viewed in light most favorable to director's (hearing officer's) decision.— The duty of the court of appeals is to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the order, viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the commissioner's (hearing officer's) decision.Floyd & Berry Davis Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-143, 88 N.M. 576, 544 P.2d 291.\n\nReview of evidence.— Whether previous owner sold out its business and whether plaintiff purchased that business is a question of fact and, accordingly, this court examines the facts. In doing so, it views the evidence in the light most favorable to the commissioner's (hearing officer's) decision.Sterling Title Co. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-086, 85 N.M. 279, 511 P.2d 765.\n\nOnly favorable evidence considered.— In determining whether there is substantial evidence in the record, the court considers only favorable evidence and views that evidence in a light most favorable to the commissioner's (hearing officer's) decision.Westland Corp. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-147, 84 N.M. 327, 503 P.2d 151, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 22, 487 P.2d 1092;C & D Trailer Sales v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-151, 93 N.M. 697, 604 P.2d 835.\n\nDirector's (hearing officer's) determination conclusive if more than one inference drawn.— If more than one inference can reasonably be drawn from the evidence, then the determination made by the commissioner (hearing officer), that the books and records were inadequate, is conclusive.Waldroop v. O'Cheskey, 1973-NMCA-146, 85 N.M. 736, 516 P.2d 1119.\n\nConclusion must be supported by entire record.— In resolving conflicts in the evidence in support of the findings, it is not contemplated, nor is it consistent with reason, that words, phrases, clauses or sentences may be selected out of context and then combined to give support for a conclusion which is not supportable by the entire text of the testimony of the witnesses on the particular subject or subjects from which the selections are taken.McVean & Barlow, Inc. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-128, 88 N.M. 521, 543 P.2d 489, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71.\n\nPresumption of assessment's correctness overcome when no substantial evidence supports.— The assessment is presumed to be correct; the taxpayer may overcome the presumption of correctness of the assessment by presenting evidence and showing that the decision of the bureau (now department) is not supported by substantial evidence.Floyd & Berry Davis Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-143, 88 N.M. 576, 544 P.2d 291.\n\nPresumption not overcome when contradictory evidence presented.— Evidence that the construction contract between the taxpayer, a contracting business, and a corporation created a ceiling price was not compelling in view of the contradictory evidence as to the actual cost of the construction, and the presumption of correctness of the assessment of gross receipts tax was not overcome.Floyd & Berry Davis Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-143, 88 N.M. 576, 544 P.2d 291.\n\nSince there was substantial evidence to support decisionthat the moneys paid to taxpayer were used solely for taxpayer's own obligations and purposes, and the appellate court found nothing in the record to indicate that any of the sums were used by taxpayer to pay the debts of any of the other three corporations, they were properly taxable under Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act (Chapter 7, Article 9 NMSA 1978).Westland Corp. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-147, 84 N.M. 327, 503 P.2d 151, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 22, 487 P.2d 1092.\n\nC. ACCORDANCE WITH LAW.\n\nDecision not in accordance with law if record not complete.— Under Subsection D(3) (Subsection C(3)), the court will set aside a decision and order of the commissioner (hearing officer) if it is found to be not in accordance with law, and the court's review, pursuant to Subsection A, must be based upon the record. Since there was nowhere in the record any indication that the ordinance in question even existed and the court found it impossible to proceed without some knowledge of the considerations underlying the bureau's (department's) action, the case was remanded so that the record could indicate the bureau's (department's) reasoning and basis for denial of taxpayer's request.Co-Con, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-134, 87 N.M. 118, 529 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 72 Am.

A person who believes that an amount of tax has been paid by or withheld from that person in excess of that for which the person was liable, who has been denied a credit or rebate claimed or who claims a prior right to property in the possession of the department pursuant to a levy made pursuant to the authority of Sections 7-1-31 through 7-1-34 NMSA 1978 may claim a refund by directing to the secretary, within the time limitations provided by Subsections F and G of this section, a written claim for refund that, except as provided in Subsection K of this section, includes:\n\n(1) the taxpayer's name, address and identification number;\n\n(2) the type of tax for which a refund is being claimed, the credit or rebate denied or the property levied upon;\n\n(3) the sum of money or other property being claimed;\n\n(4) with respect to a refund, the period for which overpayment was made;\n\n(5) a brief statement of the facts and the law on which the claim is based, which may be referred to as the \"basis for the refund\", which may include documentation that substantiates the written claim and supports the taxpayer's basis for the refund; and\n\n(6) if applicable, a copy of an amended return for each tax period for which the refund is claimed.\n\nB. A claim for refund that meets the requirements of Subsection A of this section and that is filed within the time limitations provided by Subsections F and G of this section is deemed to be properly before the department for consideration, regardless of whether the department requests additional documentation after receipt of the claim for refund.\n\nC. If the department requests additional relevant documentation from a taxpayer who has submitted a claim for refund, the claim for refund shall not be considered incomplete provided the taxpayer submits sufficient information for the department to make a determination.\n\nD. The secretary or the secretary's delegate may allow the claim in whole or in part or may deny the claim. If the:\n\n(1) claim is denied in whole or in part in writing, the person shall not refile the denied claim, but the person, within ninety days after either the mailing or delivery of the denial of all or any part of the claim, may elect to pursue only one of the remedies provided in Subsection E of this section; and\n\n(2) department has neither granted nor denied any portion of a complete claim for refund within one hundred eighty days after the claim was mailed or otherwise delivered to the department, the person may elect to treat the claim as denied and elect to pursue only one of the remedies provided in Subsection E of this section.\n\nE. A person may elect to pursue only one of the remedies provided in this subsection. A person who timely pursues more than one remedy is deemed to have elected the first. The person may:\n\n(1) direct to the secretary, pursuant to the provisions of Section 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, a written protest that sets forth:\n\n(a) the circumstances of: 1) an alleged overpayment; 2) a denied credit; 3) a denied rebate; or 4) a denial of a prior right to property levied upon by the department;\n\n(b) an allegation that, because of that overpayment or denial, the state is indebted to the taxpayer for a specified amount, including any allowed interest, or for the property;\n\n(c) a demand for the refund to the taxpayer of that amount or that property; and\n\n(d) a recitation of the facts of the claim for refund; or\n\n(2) commence a civil action in the district court for Santa Fe county by filing a complaint setting forth the circumstance of the claimed overpayment, denied credit or rebate or denial of a prior right to property levied upon by the department alleging that on account thereof the state is indebted to the plaintiff in the amount or property stated, together with any interest allowable, demanding the refund to the plaintiff of that amount or property and reciting the facts of the claim for refund. The plaintiff or the secretary may appeal from any final decision or order of the district court to the court of appeals.\n\nF.

No credit or refund shall be allowed or made to a person claiming a refund of gasoline tax pursuant to Section 7-13-11 NMSA 1978 unless notice of the destruction of the gasoline was given to the department within thirty days of the actual destruction and the claim for refund is made within six months of the date of destruction. No credit or refund shall be allowed or made to a person claiming a refund of gasoline tax pursuant to Section 7-13-17 NMSA 1978 unless the refund is claimed within six months of the date of purchase of the gasoline and the gasoline has been used at the time the claim for refund is made.\n\nH. If, as a result of an audit by the department or a managed audit covering multiple periods, an overpayment of tax is found in any period under the audit and if the taxpayer files a claim for refund for the overpayments identified in the audit, that overpayment may be credited against an underpayment of the same tax found in another period under audit pursuant to Section 7-1-29 NMSA 1978.\n\nI. A refund of tax paid under any tax or tax act administered pursuant to Subsection B of Section 7-1-2 NMSA 1978 may be made, at the discretion of the department, in the form of credit against future tax payments if future tax liabilities in an amount at least equal to the credit amount reasonably may be expected to become due.\n\nJ. For the purposes of this section, \"oil and gas tax return\" means a return reporting tax due with respect to oil, natural gas, liquid hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, helium or nonhydrocarbon gas pursuant to the Oil and Gas Severance Tax Act, the Oil and Gas Conservation Tax Act, the Oil and Gas Emergency School Tax Act, the Oil and Gas Ad Valorem Production Tax Act, the Natural Gas Processors Tax Act or the Oil and Gas Production Equipment Ad Valorem Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 34 NMSA 1978].\n\nK.

If the claim is not granted in full the person\" in Paragraph (1); added the last sentence to Paragraph (2); redesignated part of former Subsection B as present Subsection C, adding the first sentence and redesignating the subsequent subsections; in Subsection D, deleted \"the payment was made\" following \"due\" in Paragraph (1)(a); substituted \"or Capital Equipment Tax Credit Act or the rural job tax credit pursuant to Sections 7-2E-1 and 7-2E-2 NMSA 1978\" for \"or Filmmaker's Credit Act\" in Paragraph (2)(a) and added Paragraph (2)(d); and substituted \"Section 7-13-17\" for \"Section 7-13-14\" in Subsection E.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, inserted \"the payment was made\" in Subsection C(1)(a).\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective July 1, 1997, redesignated the second paragraph of Subsection A as Subsection B, inserted \"or delivery\" following \"mailing\" in the second sentence, inserted \"the department may not approve or deny the claim but\" preceding \"the person may refile\" in the third sentence; and redesignated former Subsections B through G as C through H and made related stylistic changes.\n\nThe 1996 amendment,effective July 1, 1996, rewrote the second sentence of Subsection A, added Subparagraph B(2)(a) and designated the existing provisions of Paragraph B(2) as Subparagraphs B(2)(b) and (c).\n\nThe 1994 amendment,effective July 1, 1994, substituted the exception clause at the end of the second sentence in the introductory paragraph of Subsection A for the former proviso clause, relating to the same subject matter; substituted \"person\" for \"taxpayer\" in the next-to-last sentence in the introductory paragraph of Subsection A, in Paragraph A(1) and in both sentences in Paragraph A(2), and \"July 1, 1993\" for \"the effective date of this act\" in Paragraph B(3); and added Subsection G.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, rewrote this section to the extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nDefining a pending case.— A taxpayer's request for a tax refund is a \"pending case\" within the meaning of N.M. Const., art. IV, § 34.Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Revenue Div., N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1985-NMCA-055, 103 N.M. 20, 702 P.2d 10.\n\nTax protestor can avoid hearing process altogetherby electing to pay the tax assessed and filing a refund claim with the district court.Kmart Props., Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2006-NMCA-026, 139 N.M. 177, 131 P.3d 27,rev'd on other grounds, 2006-NMSC-006, 139 N.M. 172, 131 P.3d 22.\n\nDisputing the denial of an application for a high-wage jobs tax credit.— Where taxpayer submitted an application for a high-wage jobs tax credit, which was denied by the Department of Taxation and Revenue (Department), and where taxpayer did not file a written protest to the department's denial of its credit application, pursuant to 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but rather filed an application for refund pursuant to 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, based on its original credit application, which was also denied by the department, and where taxpayer filed a written protest to the denial of its refund application, and where, following multiple hearings before the administrative hearing officer, the department filed a motion for summary judgment, and where the administrative hearing officer granted the department's motion, concluding that the only available remedy for a denial of an application for a tax credit was to file a protest within ninety days of the denial pursuant to 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, and that taxpayer's failure to file such a protest rendered the department's denial indisputable, the administrative hearing officer erred in granting the department's motion for summary judgment and denying taxpayer's protest, because neither the applicable statutes nor the department's own guidance suggest that a taxpayer's sole remedy to dispute the denial of a high-wage jobs tax credit is through the protest procedures provided in 7-1-24 NMSA 1978. The plain language of both 7-1-24 and 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, indicates that the two statutes exist as alternatives and a taxpayer may dispute a denial of a tax credit under either statute.Elite Well v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't,2023-NMCA-041.\n\nIt was mandatory that taxpayers follow administrative procedures of this sectionbefore questioning in court the constitutionality of the tax at issue, and district court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction because of the failure to timely appeal.Neff v. State ex rel. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-116, 116 N.M. 240, 861 P.2d 281.\n\nTax Administration Act requires exhaustion of remedies for each denial of a given credit.— Where plaintiff taxpayers (taxpayers) twice challenged the New Mexico taxation and revenue department's (department) denial of applications for high wage jobs tax credits, authorized by § 7-9G-1 NMSA 1978, once in 2015 and again in 2016, and where taxpayers elected to dispute the denial of the 2015 credits by filing a written protest to be heard by the department's administrative hearing officer (AHO), pursuant to § 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but elected to protest the denial of the 2016 credits by claiming a refund from the department for the credit denied, pursuant to § 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, and where the department filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that when a taxpayer pursues successive denials of tax credits raising a common issue, the taxpayer must have the issue resolved in the forum where it was initially raised or is otherwise bound by their choice of remedy for the original denial, the district court erred in granting the department's motion for summary judgment, because the Tax Administration Act, §§ 7-1-1 to 7-1-83 NMSA 1978, requires only that a taxpayer denied a given credit exhaust their remedy for that denied credit before seeking relief from the courts. Taxpayers were not required to pursue the same remedy for the denial of the 2016 credits as they pursued for the denial of the 2015 credits; the act requires only that a taxpayer exhaust whatever remedy it has chosen to challenge the denial of a given credit.Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems v. Clarke, 2021-NMCA-065.\n\nDistrict court erred in invoking primary jurisdiction.— Where plaintiff taxpayers (taxpayers) twice challenged the New Mexico taxation and revenue department's (department) denial of applications for high wage jobs tax credits, authorized by § 7-9G-1 NMSA 1978, once in 2015 and again in 2016, and where taxpayers elected to dispute the denial of the 2015 credits by filing a written protest to be heard by the department's administrative hearing officer (AHO), pursuant to § 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but elected to protest the denial of the 2016 credits by claiming a refund from the department for the credit denied, pursuant to § 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, and where the department filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that when a taxpayer pursues successive denials of tax credits raising a common issue, the taxpayer must have the issue resolved in the forum where it was initially raised or is otherwise bound by their choice of remedy for the original denial, the district court erred in granting the department's motion for summary judgment, invoking the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, because in this case, taxpayers exhausted their administrative remedies as to the 2016 credits, thereby depriving the AHO of jurisdiction, the department failed to explain why resolution of specific, factual issues raised in the 2016 credits require the peculiar expertise of the AHO, and the remedy requested by the department, entry of judgment in its favor, is not one available under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems v. Clarke, 2021-NMCA-065.\n\nSection provides adequate remedy at law.— Taxpayers have standing under this section to contest the constitutionality of New Mexico taxes assessed against them; thus, under the rule ofNational Private Truck Council v. Oklahoma Tax Commission, 515 U.S. 582, 115 S. Ct. 2351, 132 L. Ed. 2d 509 (1995), a § 1983 action for injunctive or declaratory relief cannot lie with respect to imposition of a state tax, because taxpayers have been provided an adequate remedy at law.Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd., Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1999-NMCA-050, 127 N.M. 101, 977 P.2d 1021, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 389, 981 P.2d 1207.\n\nSecretary decides actions on refund claims.— Secretary of the taxation and revenue department has discretion to act or refuse to act on refund claims under Sections 7-1-26A and 7-1-29A NMSA 1978.Unisys Corp. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-059, 117 N.M. 609, 874 P.2d 1273.\n\nPurpose of time deadlinein this section is to avoid stale claims, which protects the department's ability to stabilize and predict, with some degree of certainty, the funds it collects and manages.Kilmer v. Goodwin, 2004-NMCA-122, 136 N.M. 440, 99 P.3d 690.\n\nBurden of maintaining active claim.— The time deadline in this section places the burden of maintaining an active claim on the taxpayer and department does not have implied authority to allow claim after 210 days.Kilmer v. Goodwin, 2004-NMCA-122, 136 N.M. 440, 99 P.3d 690.\n\nStrictness of time requirement.— The legislature has stated a definite requirement that it was incumbent upon taxpayers to act within the 210-day window in this section.Kilmer v. Goodwin, 2004-NMCA-122, 136 N.M. 440, 99 P.3d 690.\n\nRunning of statutory period.— The statutory period to pursue a remedy under 7-1-26(B)(1) NMSA 1978 begins from the delivery of a notice of denial of refund when the taxation and revenue department mails rather than hand delivers the notice.Schneider Nat'l, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2006-NMCA-128, 140 N.M. 561, 144 P.3d 120.\n\nLetter does not start time running.— Because this section prohibited the department from approving or denying the claim for refund, a letter stating that essential conclusion does not start the time running again.Kilmer v. Goodwin, 2004-NMCA-122, 136 N.M. 440, 99 P.3d 690.\n\nTime limitation not denial of plain and speedy remedy.— Fact that this section limits claims for refund to periods three years from the end of the calendar year in which payment of the New Mexico income tax was due did not deny plaintiffs a plain, speedy and efficient remedy under New Mexico law so as to invoke federal jurisdiction in tax refund case.Lung v. O'Cheskey, 358 F. Supp. 928 (D.N.M.),aff'd, 414 U.S. 802, 94 S. Ct. 159, 38 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1973).\n\nEnactment of limitation not impermissible exercise of state's legislative power.— The enactment of a statute fixing a period of limitations within which to sue the state for a refund does not constitute an impermissible exercise of legislative power of a state. When a statute creates a substantive right and in connection therewith specifies the time within which an action for the enforcement thereof must be instituted, upon failure to institute the action within the specified period, not only the remedy, but the right of action itself, is extinguished.United States v. Bureau of Revenue, 217 F. Supp. 849 (D.N.M. 1963).\n\nFailure to institute action constitutes waiver of protest.— Failure of the atomic energy commission, which had become subrogated to the rights of certain uranium producers to protest the imposition of certain taxes on the proceeds of the uranium sold to it, to bring suit within four months constituted a waiver of the protest and of all claims against the state on account of any illegality in the tax so paid, since the statute created the substantive right to sue the state for a refund and fixed the time within which suit for the enforcement of the right must be instituted.U.S. v. Bureau of Revenue, 217 F. Supp. 849 (D.N.M. 1963).\n\nEstoppel.— Where the department did not make any written representations during the 210-day period about how taxpayers should proceed, and department representative's statements merely informed parties' accountant to wait to see the manner in which the department would decide the issue, such a generic, oral representation does not provide a basis for estoppel.Kilmer v. Goodwin, 2004-NMCA-122, 136 N.M. 440, 99 P.3d 690.\n\nNo offset of overpayment against prior liability.— No statute expressly authorizes the taxation and revenue department to apply overpayments of taxes for one reporting period as offsets against underpayments for another prior reporting period. In fact, the legislature has granted the department only the specific authority to credit refunds or overpayments of gas production taxes against future tax payments.

In response to a claim for refund, credit or rebate made as provided in Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, but before a court acquires jurisdiction of the matter, the secretary or the secretary's delegate may authorize payment to a person in the amount of the credit or rebate claimed or refund an overpayment of tax determined by the secretary or the secretary's delegate to have been erroneously made by the person, together with allowable interest. A payment of a credit rebate claimed or a refund of tax and interest erroneously paid amounting to twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) or more shall be made with the prior approval of the attorney general, except that the secretary or the secretary's delegate may make refunds with respect to the Oil and Gas Severance Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 29 NMSA 1978], the Oil and Gas Conservation Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 30 NMSA 1978], the Oil and Gas Emergency School Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 31 NMSA 1978], the Oil and Gas Ad Valorem Production Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 32 NMSA 1978], the Natural Gas Processors Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 33 NMSA 1978] or the Oil and Gas Production Equipment Ad Valorem Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 34 NMSA 1978], Section 7-13-17 NMSA 1978 and the Cigarette Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 12 NMSA 1978] without the prior approval of the attorney general regardless of the amount.\n\nB. Pursuant to the final order of the district court, the court of appeals, the supreme court of New Mexico or a federal court, from which order, appeal or review is not successfully taken, adjudging that a person has properly claimed a credit, rebate or a refund of overpaid tax, the secretary shall authorize the payment to the person of the amount thereof. After a court acquires jurisdiction but before it issues a final order, the secretary may authorize payment of a credit, rebate or refund pursuant to a closing agreement pursuant to Section 7-1-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. In the discretion of the secretary, any amount of credit or rebate to be paid or tax to be refunded may be offset against any amount of tax for which the person due to receive the credit, rebate payment or refund is liable. The secretary or the secretary's delegate shall give notice to the taxpayer that the credit, rebate payment or refund will be made in this manner, and the taxpayer shall be entitled to interest pursuant to Section 7-1-68 NMSA 1978 until the tax liability is credited with the credit, rebate or refund amount.\n\nD. In an audit by the department or a managed audit covering multiple reporting periods in which both underpayments and overpayments of a tax have been made in different reporting periods, the department shall credit the tax overpayments against the underpayments; provided that the taxpayer files a claim for refund of the overpayments. An overpayment shall be applied as a credit first to the earliest underpayment and then to succeeding underpayments. An underpayment of tax to which an overpayment is credited pursuant to this section shall be deemed paid in the period in which the overpayment was made or the period to which the overpayment was credited against an underpayment, whichever is later. If the overpayments credited pursuant to this section exceed the underpayments of a tax, the amount of the net overpayment for the periods covered in the audit shall be refunded to the taxpayer.\n\nE. When a taxpayer makes a payment identified to a particular return or assessment, and the department determines that the payment exceeds the amount due pursuant to that return or assessment, the secretary may apply the excess to the taxpayer's other liabilities pursuant to the tax acts to which the return or assessment applies, without requiring the taxpayer to file a claim for a refund. The liability to which an overpayment is applied pursuant to this section shall be deemed paid in the period in which the overpayment was made or the period to which the overpayment was applied, whichever is later.\n\nF. If the department determines, upon review of an original or amended income tax return, corporate income and franchise tax return, estate tax return, special fuels excise tax return or oil and gas tax return, that there has been an overpayment of tax for the taxable period to which the return or amended return relates in excess of the amount due to be refunded to the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Subsection K of Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, the department may refund that excess amount to the taxpayer without requiring the taxpayer to file a refund claim.\n\nG. Records of refunds and credits made in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) shall be available for inspection by the public. The department shall keep such records for a minimum of three years from the date of the refund or credit.\n\nH. In response to a timely refund claim pursuant to Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978 and notwithstanding any other provision of the Tax Administration Act, the secretary or the secretary's delegate may refund or credit a portion of an assessment of tax paid, including applicable penalties and interest representing the amount of tax previously paid by another person on behalf of the taxpayer on the same transaction; provided that the requirements of equitable recoupment are met. For purposes of this subsection, the refund claim may be filed by the taxpayer to whom the assessment was issued or by another person who claims to have previously paid the tax on behalf of the taxpayer. Prior to granting the refund or credit, the secretary may require a waiver of all rights to claim a refund or credit of the tax previously paid by another person paying a tax on behalf of the taxpayer.\n\nI. If, as a result of an audit by the department or a managed audit, a person is determined to owe gross receipts tax on receipts from the sale of property or services, the department may credit against the amount owed an amount of compensating tax paid by the purchaser if the person can demonstrate that the purchaser timely paid the compensating tax on the same property or services. The credit provided by this subsection shall not be denied solely because the purchaser cannot timely file for a refund of the compensating tax paid and, if the credit is to be granted, the department shall require, for the purpose of granting the credit, that the purchaser give up any right to claim a refund of that tax.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-13-43, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 248, § 31;

added Subsection D and redesignated the remaining subsection accordingly.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective July 1, 1992, in Subsection A, substituted \"Any refund\" for \"Refunds\" and deleted \"during any one calendar year\" following \"($5,000)\" in the second sentence, inserted the colon and Paragraph (1) designation, and added Paragraph (2); and substituted \"five thousand dollars ($5,000)\" for \"one thousand dollars ($1,000)\" in the first sentence of Subsection D.\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective June 16, 1989, in Subsection A, in the first sentence, substituted \"secretary or the secretary's delegate\" for \"director or his delegate\" in two places, deleted \"with the written approval of the attorney general\" preceding \"authorize the refund\", in the second sentence, deleted \"Notwithstanding the above\" from the beginning, substituted \"more than five thousand dollars\" for \"less than five thousand dollars\", \"only with the prior approval\" for \"without the prior approval\" and \"through 7-13-15 NMSA 1978\" for \"through 7-13-16 NMSA 1978\" and inserted the language beginning with \"except that\" and ending with \"Oil and Gas Production Equipment Ad Valorem Tax Act\"; in Subsections B and C, substituted \"the secretary\" for \"the director or his delegate\"; in Subsection D, substituted \"department\" for \"division\" in the second sentence; and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nSecretary decides actions on refund claims.— Secretary of the taxation and revenue department has discretion to act or refuse to act on refund claims under Sections 7-1-26A and 7-1-29A NMSA 1978.Unisys Corp. v.

In fact, the legislature has granted the department only the specific authority to credit refunds or overpayments of gas production taxes against future tax payments. The department complied with this provision by allowing taxpayer to net out its overpayment against current tax liabilities on the estimated tax term form when taxpayer filed its amended form reporting an overpayment of taxes for a prior reporting period.Amoco Prod.

The policy behind placing this duty on the successor is to secure collection of taxes by imposing derivative liability on purchasers of a business who are generally in a better financial position to collect or pay the tax from the sale price than the seller quitting the business.Hi-Country Buick GMC v.

Implicit in the taxation and revenue department's definition of \"successor\" is the notion that the future intent of a transferee of a business, once it has received the business, is an important aspect of determining whether it is a \"successor\". A successor may include a business that is acquired and run for an indefinite period by a creditor of the predecessor, but does not include one who acquires and operates a business for a limited period of time in order to protect its collateral. The distinguishing feature is whether the entity acquiring the business intends to retain and operate the business.Hi-Country Buick GMC v. N.M.

Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1989-NMCA-070, 108 N.M. 795, 779 P.2d 982.\n\nII. NEGLIGENCE.\n\nTaxpayers were not negligentin failing to pay natural gas processor's tax on operation which removed carbon dioxide from coal seam gas where, at the time the applicable tax was enacted, coal seam gas was not processed and the applicable tax law accordingly did not directly address whether the removal of carbon dioxide from coal seam gas constituted \"processing.\"Amoco Prod. Co. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMCA-092, 134 N.M. 162, 74 P.3d 96.\n\nPropriety of penalty.— Taxpayer's penalty was proper where her failure to pay gross receipts tax was negligent based on the hearing officer's finding that the failure was due to the taxpayer's lack of knowledge and her erroneous belief that gross receipts tax was not due on certain transactions.Grogan v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMCA-033, 133 N.M. 354, 62 P.3d 1236, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 413, 63 P.3d 516.\n\nReliance on manufacturer's advice.— Where taxpayer, who operated a retail tobacco store, failed to pay gross receipts tax from buy-down and shelf-display contracts with cigarette manufacturers in reliance upon discussions of taxpayer's tax liability with the manufacturers was negligent because taxpayer did not reasonably attempt to determine whether taxpayer's actions were justifiable under the tax statutes and regulations.Grogan v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2002, NMCA-033, 133 N.M. 354, 62 P.3d 1236, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 413, 63 P.3d 516.\n\nMinimum penalty for negligence when no tax due under equitable recoupment.— When the amount erroneously paid by the taxpayer for a particular tax equals the amount that should have been paid for another tax and, under the doctrine of equitable recoupment, no further sums are due from the taxpayer, there is no basis for assessing a penalty as a percentage of the tax due, but the taxpayer may be required to pay the $5 minimum penalty if the error resulted from the taxpayer's negligence.Teco Invs. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-055, 125 N.M. 103, 957 P.2d 532.\n\nOrdinary business care required.— Taxpayer was liable for civil penalties when taxpayer's failure to pay the gross receipts tax due was based on its erroneous beliefs, inattention, inaction where action would be reasonably required, or a failure to exercise the degree of ordinary business care that similarly situated businesses would exercise.Arco Materials, Inc. v. State, Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-062, 118 N.M. 12, 878 P.2d 330,rev'd on other grounds sub nom.Blaze Constr. Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMSC-110, 118 N.M. 647, 884 P.2d 803, cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1016, 115 S. Ct. 1359, 131 L. Ed. 2d 216 (1995).\n\nNegligence not excused by actions of auditors.— A negligence penalty assessed against a taxpayer for its total failure to pay any compensating tax for a period of years was proper, since the taxpayer's sole excuse was that the failure to pay the tax was not uncovered by the accountants who certified the accuracy of the taxpayer's financial statements for the annual reports to shareholders required by federal securities law. The taxpayer offered no evidence that the outside auditors reviewed the taxpayer's monthly state tax returns, did not explain why the audit for the annual reports should have uncovered the failure to pay the compensating tax, and did not explain why the failure of the auditors to discover the error would excuse the taxpayer's failure to comply with clear state law.Vivigen, Inc. v. Minzner, 1994-NMCA-027, 117 N.M. 224, 870 P.2d 1382.\n\nSubstantial evidence of negligence.— Substantial evidence supported hearing officer's finding that nursing home's failure to pay tax was due to negligence, since the home failed to show the hearing officer that it acted reasonably in not reporting a medicaid readjustment to income payments as gross receipts.El Centro Villa Nursing Ctr. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1989-NMCA-070, 108 N.M. 795, 779 P.2d 982.\n\nTaxpayer's erroneous belief tantamount to negligence.— A taxpayer's mere belief that he is not liable to pay taxes is tantamount to negligence within the meaning of this section and invocation of the penalty is appropriate.C & D Trailer Sales v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-151, 93 N.M. 697, 604 P.2d 835.\n\nTaxpayer's erroneous belief and no further investigation constituted negligence.— When taxpayer, an Arizona corporation headquartered in Phoenix, failed to file a return for work performed on the Navajo reservation within New Mexico (the first road job taxpayer had done in New Mexico), its belief that no taxes were due and that there were no taxes that they had to file for or register for, without further investigation, constituted negligence so as to justify the penalty imposed.Tiffany Constr. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-127, 90 N.M. 16, 558 P.2d 1155, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 255, 561 P.2d 1348 (1977).\n\n\"Negligent\" meansindifferent, careless or off-hand or lacking reasonable cause.Tiffany Constr. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-127, 90 N.M. 16, 558 P.2d 1155, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 255, 561 P.2d 1348 (1977).\n\nNegligence is general standard defining director's duties.— \"Negligence\" as used in Subsection A is a general standard capable of reasonable application and sufficient to limit and define the commissioner's (now director's) powers in imposing a penalty.Gathings v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-016, 87 N.M. 334, 533 P.2d 107.\n\nNegligence should be equated with federal standard.— \"Negligence,\" as used in Subsection A, should be equated with the federal standard of \"lack of reasonable cause\" as set forth in 26 U.S.C. § 6651(a).Gathings v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-016, 87 N.M. 334, 533 P.2d 107.\n\nIII. PROTEST.\n\nEvidence of diligent protest based on informed consultation and advice.— Conclusory and self-serving statements in affidavits of an officer of the taxpayer and a tax attorney were insufficient to give rise to a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of any acceptable ground for excusing the taxpayer's failure to report and pay gross receipts tax.Sonic Indus., Inc. v. State, 2000-NMCA-087, 129 N.M. 657, 11 P.3d 1219,rev'd on other grounds, 2006-NMSC-038, 140 N.M. 212, 141 P.3d 1266.\n\n\"Diligent protest\" negates negligence.— When a taxpayer's failure to pay taxes is the result of a \"diligent protest\" and his decision to challenge a tax is based on informed consultation and advice (i.e., from his attorney or accountant), the taxpayer negates any inference of negligence and the application of the penalty provision is inappropriate.C & D Trailer Sales v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-151, 93 N.M. 697, 604 P.2d 835.\n\nReasonable doubt negates disregard of rules.— Penalty was improperly assessed and taxpayer is not liable for penalty and interest where diligent protest by the taxpayer negated the possibility of negligence, and the taxpayer did not disregard the rules and regulations because there was reasonable doubt as to the correctness of the taxes imposed by the commissioner (now secretary).Stohr v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-118, 90 N.M. 43, 559 P.2d 420, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 254, 561 P.2d 1347 (1977).\n\nNot negligence to protest rulings or disregard where reasonable doubt.— This section provides that a penalty shall be added to the amount owed only in the event of failure to pay an assessed amount due to negligence or disregard of rules and regulations. Taxpayers were neither negligent nor heedless of any rules and regulations where they carried forward a thorough protest against the rulings of the commissioner (now secretary) with reasonable doubt as to the interpretation and applicability of the various taxes sought to be imposed by his order. Any presumptions of correctness which might have attached to the commissioner's (now secretary's) decision had been sufficiently overcome. The decision to assess penalties, not being in accordance with the law, was reversed in its entirety.Co-Con, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue,1974-NMCA-134, 87 N.M. 118, 529 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 72 Am.

As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"sales suppression software\" means hidden or concealed computer software, also known as phantomware, for a point-of-sale system that can create a second set of records or eliminate or manipulate transaction records that may or may not be preserved in digital formats in order to misrepresent the existence or the true record of a transaction in the point-of-sale system. \"Sales suppression software\" includes an electronic device that carries or contains sales suppression software;\n\n(2) \"tax\" does not include civil penalties or interest; and\n\n(3) \"willfully\" means intentionally, deliberately or purposely, but not necessarily maliciously.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-13-86, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 248, § 74; 1978 Comp., § 7-1-73; 1979, ch. 144, § 60; 1989, ch. 325, § 12; 1992, ch. 55, § 17; 2005, ch. 108, § 3; 2006, ch. 29, § 1; 2023, ch. 36, § 4.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective July 1, 2023, provided that evading or defeating a tax with sales suppression software constitutes tax fraud, and defined \"sales suppression software\"; in Subsection A, added Paragraphs A(5) and A(6); and in Subsection H, added a new Paragraph H(1) and redesignated former Paragraphs H(1) and H(2) as Paragraphs H(2) and H(3), respectively.\n\nThe 2006 amendment,effective July 1, 2006, changed the crime from \"false statement and fraud\" to \"tax fraud\" in Subsection A; deleted the former provision at the end of Paragraph (4) of Subsection A, which provided that a violation of Subsection A was a felony; added Subsections B through F to provide a schedule for sentencing for different degrees of tax fraud; and added Subsection G to provide that in addition to fines, a person who commits tax fraud shall pay the cost of prosecution.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added Subsection A(2) to provide that a person is guilty of a felony if the person willfully acts in the preparation or presentation of a document with respect to a matter under the Tax Administration Act or a tax administered by the taxation and revenue department knowing that it is false or fraudulent; deleted from Subsection A(4) the statement of the penalty for conviction of a felony under this section; and added Subsection B to provide definitions of \"tax\" and \"willfully\".\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective July 1, 1992, added Subsection B, redesignated former Subsection B as Subsection C, and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective June 16, 1989, in Subsection A, substituted \"that it is true and correct as to every material matter and which the individual or person does not\" for \"that it is made under the penalties of perjury and which he does not\".\n\nTraditional standard of proof applied in tax fraud cases.— Court of appeals would not require a higher standard of proof in terms of criminal intent in tax fraud cases, choosing instead to follow the traditional standard of appellate review in criminal cases.State v. Martin, 1977-NMCA-049, 90 N.M. 524, 565 P.2d 1041, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 636, 567 P.2d 485,overruled on other grounds byState v. Wilson, 1994-NMSC-009, 116 N.M. 793, 867 P.2d 1175.\n\nTo meet willfulness requirement of section,all that is required is proof that the person acted intentionally in the sense that he was aware of what he was doing.State v. Sparks, 1985-NMCA-004, 102 N.M. 317, 694 P.2d 1382.\n\nUJI Criminal 1.50 (UJI 14-141 NMRA), the instruction on general criminal intent,is required in prosecutions for false statements on tax returns.State v.
