Atwood, 1979-NMSC-098, 93 N.M. 657, 604 P.2d 123.\n\nRequirements of valid absentee ballot.— A qualified absentee voter must in good faith have a reasonable belief that he may be unable to vote in person on election day for one or more of the specific statutory reasons and must sign the proper affidavits under oath to prove his status; after he has done this, it is the burden of the one challenging his right to vote to come forward and prove that the ballot is illegal, either when the votes are counted or by election contest.Kiehne v. Atwood, 1979-NMSC-098, 93 N.M. 657, 604 P.2d 123.\n\nCertain knowledge of absence not required.— To hold that the application for an absentee ballot must be made with certain knowledge that a voter cannot be present would place unreasonable constraints upon the right to vote and would be in contravention of the legislature's manifest intent to enlarge the voter franchise.Kiehne v. Atwood, 1979-NMSC-098, 93 N.M. 657, 604 P.2d 123.\n\nPresence in county on election dayby otherwise qualified absentee voter does not invalidate his vote.Kiehne v.

The notice of requested mailed ballot shall inform the voter of the address to which the ballot was mailed along with the phone number of the county clerk's office and the internet address of the voter web portal provided by the secretary of state. The notice of requested mailed ballot shall be sent to the address provided on the voter's certificate of registration on the same day the county clerk sends the mailed ballot to the address requested by the voter.\n\nH. When an application for a mailed ballot is rejected pursuant to this section, the county clerk shall send a notice of rejection to the mailing address on the voter's certificate of registration and the address listed on the voter's application for mailed ballot, if different. The notice of rejection shall indicate the reason for the rejection and, if applicable, information on how to correct the deficiency that is the reason for the rejection. If an application is rejected because it was not timely received, the county clerk shall, within twenty-four hours of receipt of the application, send a rejection notice to the voter that shall include a list of the early voting locations and election day polling places in the county.\n\nI.

If, pursuant to Subsection F of Section 1-6-4 NMSA 1978, the voter was notified of the need to comply with federal identification requirements when returning the requested ballot and failed to comply, the county clerk shall preserve the inner envelope with the official mailing envelope and write \"Rejected\" on the front of the official mailing envelope, and the county clerk shall update the ballot register accordingly and immediately send the voter a notice to cure containing information regarding how the voter may provide the missing or incorrect information. The county clerk shall place the official mailing envelope with the attached inner envelope in a container provided for rejected ballots; provided that if the county clerk was required to open the inner envelope to determine that the required documentary identification was not included, the untallied ballot shall be returned to the inner envelope and preserved along with the official mailing envelope in a container for this purpose.\n\nF. The voter may provide the missing or corrected information at any time up to the conclusion of the appeal process for rejected ballots. If a voter provides the missing or corrected information:\n\n(1) before the absent voter election board has been convened, the county clerk shall attach the documentation to the unopened official mailing envelope, update the ballot register accordingly and transfer the ballot to the locked and number-sealed ballot box until it is delivered to the absent voter election board;\n\n(2) after the absent voter election board has been convened, the county clerk shall attach the documentation to the unopened official mailing envelope, update the ballot register accordingly and transfer the ballot to the absent voter election board;\n\n(3) after the adjournment of the absent voter election board but before the conclusion of the county canvass process, the county clerk shall attach the documentation to the unopened official mailing envelope, update the ballot register accordingly and transfer the ballot to an election board convened to assist in preparation of the county canvass report; and\n\n(4) after approval of the county canvass report, the voter may appeal in accordance with appeal procedures for provisional ballots established by rule of the secretary of state pursuant to Section 1-12-25.2 NMSA 1978.\n\nG. In a statewide election, if the unopened official mailing envelope is received by the county clerk from an election board before the absent voter election board has adjourned, the unopened official mailing envelope shall be transmitted to the absent voter election board to be tallied immediately. If the unopened official mailing envelope is received by the county clerk from an election board after the absent voter election board has adjourned, the unopened official mailing envelope shall be transmitted to an election board convened to assist in preparation of the county canvass report to be tallied and included in the canvass report of that county for the appropriate precinct.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 3-6-10, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 240, § 136; 1975, ch. 255, § 88; 1981, ch. 150, § 4; 1983, ch. 232, § 4; 1989, ch. 392, § 13; 1999, ch. 267, § 14; 2005, ch. 270, § 48; 2007, ch. 336, § 10; 2011, ch. 137, § 44; 2015, ch. 145, § 48; 2019, ch. 212, § 71; 2023, ch. 39, § 30.\n\nCross references.— For absentee ballot register,see1-6-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor handling of absentee ballots by absent voter precinct boards,see1-6-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, revised the duties of the county clerk related to receiving mailed ballots; deleted former Subsection A and added new Subsections A through F and redesignated former Subsection B as Subsection G; in Subsection G, after each occurrence of \"shall be\", deleted \"logged and\", and added \"to an election board convened to assist in preparation of the county canvass report\"; and deleted former Subsections C and D.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective April 3, 2019, changed \"absentee ballots\" to \"mailed ballots\", changed \"precinct board\" to \"election board\", and revised the procedure for receiving mailed ballots; in the section heading, deleted \"absentee\" and added \"mailed\"; in Subsection A, after \"delivered to the\", deleted \"absent voter precinct\" and added \"proper election\", after \"board,\", added \"counted in the county canvass\", after \"or\", deleted \"until it is\"; added a new Subsection B and redesignated former Subsection B as Subsection C; in Subsection D, after \"shall not be\", deleted \"delivered to the absent voter precinct board\" and added \"qualified or opened\", after \"preserved by the county clerk\", deleted \"until the time for election contests has expired.
