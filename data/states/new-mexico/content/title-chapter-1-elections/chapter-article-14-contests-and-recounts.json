APPLICABILITY.\n\nElection Code applies to public improvement district formation elections.— The formation election provisions of the Public Improvement District Act incorporate the election contest procedures of the Election Code.Glaser v. LeBus, 2012-NMCA-028, 274 P.3d 114.\n\nResidency challenge of candidateis proper election contest.Thompson v. Robinson, 1984-NMSC-096, 101 N.M. 703, 688 P.2d 21.\n\nApplicability of rules of procedure.— Prior to the adoption of the New Mexico Rules of Civil Procedure for the district courts, none of the rules of procedure applicable in civil actions were applicable to an election contest.Montoya v. McManus, 1961-NMSC-060, 68 N.M. 381, 362 P.2d 771.\n\nCourt jurisdiction to entertain municipal election contest.— District court had jurisdiction to entertain election contest for various municipal offices irrespective of the act under which they might be operating.Ostic v.

Besse v. District Court of Fourth Judicial Dist., 1925-NMSC-025, 31 N.M. 82, 239 P. 452.\n\nJustices of peace (now magistrates) and constables may instituteelection contest proceedings.Carabajal v. Lucero, 1916-NMSC-045, 22 N.M. 30, 158 P. 1088.\n\nII. EXCLUSIVITY.\n\nElection contest and recount are not mutually exclusive.Although an election contest is a completely separate remedy from a recount, the election contest is a much broader remedy.Weldon v. Sanders, 1982-NMSC-136, 99 N.M. 160, 655 P.2d 1004.\n\nElection contest is special proceeding unknown to common law.— A contestant has a right to contest only in the manner and to the extent provided in the election contest statutes.Montoya v. McManus, 1961-NMSC-060, 1944-NMSC-013, 68 N.M. 381, 362 P.2d 771.\n\nRight to challenge not precluded by prior adverse mandamus.— Contestant's right to challenge election of contestee in statutory election contest was not precluded by prior adverse judgment in mandamus proceeding instituted on relation of contestant.Valdez v. Herrera, 1944-NMSC-013, 48 N.M. 45, 145 P.2d 864.\n\nSpecial statutory contest proceedings bar quo warranto.— The election contest being a special statutory proceeding, the right is not to be inferred from doubtful provisions, since granting of contest bars contestants from right to statutory quo warranto.Montoya v. Gurule, 1934-NMSC-092, 39 N.M. 42, 38 P.2d 1118.\n\nExclusive remedy for election contest.— Former article provided exclusive remedy for contest of elections and superseded remedy by quo warranto.State ex rel. Abercrombie v. District Court of Fourth Judicial Dist., 1933-NMSC-057, 37 N.M. 407, 24 P.2d 265.\n\nIII. GROUNDS.\n\nElements of election contest.— An election contest is a challenge to the result of an election, as well as a challenge to the inherent validity of an election when the challenge would necessarily require overturning the results or effects of an election. An election contest can derive from a violation of a provision of the Election Code, from a violation of another statute governing the particular election at issue, or from the New Mexico Constitution.Glaser v. LeBus, 2012-NMCA-028, 274 P.3d 114.\n\nPlaintiff's complaint presented an election contest under the Public Improvement District Act.— Where plaintiff alleged that the petition and ballot to form a public improvement district were invalid because they did not meet statutory requirements; that the information provided to the municipality and the voters prior to the formation election was false, fraudulent, or misleading; and that the ballot did not present a question that specifically addressed the authority to tax, the challenges to the underlying validity of the election based on a failure to comply with statutory requirements was an election contest governed by the Election Code's election contest procedures.Glaser v. LeBus, 2012-NMCA-028, 274 P.3d 114.\n\nSufficiency of complaint.— A complaint alleging that a candidate received a majority of the votes cast, and that the improper conduct of the election officials in refusing to count certain votes deprived him of victory, is sufficient to support an election contest.Weldon v. Sanders, 1982-NMSC-136, 99 N.M. 160, 655 P.2d 1004.\n\nRight to hold office is not property rightnor is it vested one.Montoya v. McManus, 1961-NMSC-060, 68 N.M. 381, 362 P.2d 771.\n\nClaimed majority as constitutional grounds.— A candidate's claimed majority, adversely affected by conduct of election officials, afforded sufficient grounds for an election contest under N.M. Const., art. VII, § 5.Seele v. Smith, 1947-NMSC-068, 51 N.M. 484, 188 P.2d 337.\n\nChallenge to rights of voters should show bad faith, etc.— In absence of any showing of bad faith, fraud or reasonable opportunity for fraud, court will rather unsympathetically and most carefully examine any challenge to rights of a large number of voters in an election.Valdez v. Herrera, 1944-NMSC-013, 48 N.M. 45, 145 P.2d 864.\n\nAllegation that unsuccessful candidate elected constitutes contest grounds.— Any allegations showing that the unsuccessful candidate was legally elected will constitute ground for election contest; allegation that contestant received majority of votes, but that ballots were fraudulently altered after return stated ground for contest.Rogers v. Scott, 1931-NMSC-027, 35 N.M. 446, 300 P. 441.\n\nElection not set aside for mere irregularity.— If no fraud or illegal voting is shown, elections conducted fairly and honestly, will not be set aside for mere irregularity in the manner of the appointment of the election officers, or in the conduct of the election.Carabajal v. Lucero, 1916-NMSC-045, 22 N.M. 30, 158 P. 1088.\n\nCourt to reject illegal votes.— Code 1915, § 2069 (now repealed) provided \"to reject any illegal votes that may be polled at any election . . . it shall not be necessary to contest or question them at the polls, but they may be rejected by the authorities qualified by law to determine the validity of said elections, by being proved, after due notice is given by the party contesting said election to the opposing party . . ..\" It was then the only mode by which illegal votes received and returned by the judges of election could be determined and rejected, and it was not to be done by the canvassing officers at the time the returns from several precincts were canvassed by them. The only lawful tribunal having jurisdiction to determine questions of this kind was the district court.Bull v. Southwick, 1882-NMSC-015, 2 N.M. 321.\n\nIV. NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\nLocal option election not contestable.— Provision in local option election statute that those elections should be conducted in manner provided by law for general elections did not provide for election contest or recounts therein since general laws did not grant rights of contest or recount.State ex rel. Denton v. Vinyard, 1951-NMSC-030, 55 N.M. 205, 230 P.2d 238.\n\nRemedy not lost due to knowledge of prior events.— A candidate is not deprived of his remedy by contest because of anything which happened prior to the contest where he did not participate, though it transpired with his knowledge or consent.Valdez v. Herrera, 1944-NMSC-013, 48 N.M. 45, 145 P.2d 864.\n\nContests not applicable to changing county seat.— Former contest provisions had no application to contest of election for changing county seat.Orchard v. Board of Comm'rs, 1938-NMSC-011, 42 N.M. 172, 76 P.2d 41.\n\nMunicipal school board election not contestable.— An election for members of board of education of a municipal school district was not contestable.Auge v. Owen, 1935-NMSC-074, 39 N.M. 470, 49 P.2d 1134.\n\nContests not applicable to land grant board of trustees.— Contest and recount provisions are applicable only to general elections for state, district and county offices, and not to election of board of trustees of land grant.Montoya v. Gurule, 1934-NMSC-092, 39 N.M. 42, 38 P.2d 1118.\n\nDistrict attorney may not entertain contest.— Code 1915, §§ 2060 to 2080 did not authorize district courts to entertain contest proceeding for office of district attorney.Crist v. Abbott, 1917-NMSC-009, 22 N.M. 417, 163 P. 1085.\n\nConstitutional amendment election.— There are no lawful grounds for a recount in New Mexico of a constitutional amendment election. 2004 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 04-01\n\nLaw reviews. —For note, \"Why Gunaji v. Macias Matters to Candidates and Voters: Its Impact on New Mexico Election Law\", see 33 N.M.L. Rev. 431 (2003).\n\nAm.

Martinez, 1944-NMSC-005, 48 N.M. 30, 145 P.2d 487 (decided under former law).\n\nPerson holding certificate takes possession and discharges duties of office.— Election of justices of peace (now magistrates) may be contested before probate judge, and contest must be heard and determined in summary manner; pending such contest, person holding certificate of election takes possession and discharges duties of office.Quintana v.

      "heading": "Contest of election; filing of complaint.",
      "text": "Any action to contest an election shall be commenced by filing a verified complaint of contest in the district court of the county where either of the parties resides. Such complaint shall be filed no later than thirty days from issuance of the certificate of nomination or issuance of the certificate of election to the successful candidate. The party instituting the action shall be known as the contestant, and the party against whom the action is instituted shall be known as the contestee. The Rules of Civil Procedure apply to all actions commenced under the provisions of this section.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 3-14-3, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 240, § 328; 1971, ch. 210, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For the Rules of Civil Procedure,seeRule 1-001 NMRA et seq.\n\nApplication of the Election Code to public improvement district formation elections.— The Election Code's thirty-day limitation period for filing a complaint to contest an election applies to a public improvement district formation election under the Public Improvement District Act.Glaser v. LeBus, 2012-NMSC-012, 276 P.3d 959.\n\nWhere the petitioners filed a complaint to contest an election to form a public improvement district under the Public Improvement District Act thirteen months after the election, the action was barred by the thirty-day limitation for filing a complaint to contest an election under the Election Code.Glaser v. LeBus, 2012-NMSC-012, 276 P.3d 959.\n\nShorter filing period in Rule 1-087 NMRA held invalid.— The 30-day filing period granted by the legislature in this section represents a substantive right which the supreme court has no power to reduce. Therefore, that portion of Rule 1-087 NMRA requiring notice of an election contest to be filed within 15 days of the issuance of the certificate of nomination is invalid, although other portions of the rule remain valid and must be followed.Eturriaga v. Valdez, 1989-NMSC-080, 109 N.M. 205, 784 P.2d 24.\n\n\"Election contest\" construed.— Where petitioner sought a writ of mandamus directing respondent to effectuate the compilation of three constitutional amendments which were voted on in three separate elections, and where the petition was filed one, five, and seven years after the elections at issue were certified, the petition was not time-barred, because the substantive issue presented, whether a simple majority of the voters was enough to approve the 2008, 2010, and 2014 amendments to N.M. Const., art. VII, § 1 is not an election contest and the 30-day filing period does not apply, because the petition, rather than seeking to alter the certified results of the elections, sought clarity about the meaning and effect of the uncontested certified results of the elections under the New Mexico constitution.State ex rel. League of Women Voters v. Advisory Comm., 2017-NMSC-025.\n\nUnverified petition dismissed.— A petition contesting the validity of a special bond election for the construction of a cultural facility did not invoke the jurisdiction of the district court, because it was not verified in accordance with this section, and was, therefore, properly dismissed.Dinwiddie v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1985-NMSC-099, 103 N.M. 442, 708 P.2d 1043, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1117, 106 S. Ct. 1974, 90 L. Ed. 2d 658 (1986).\n\nSection applicable to contest of primary election.— This section, not 1-8-35 NMSA 1978, applies to the contest of a primary election.Thompson v. Robinson, 1984-NMSC-096, 101 N.M. 703, 688 P.2d 21.\n\nNotice of contest to allege contestant received more votes.— Since the objective of the contestant in an election contest is to be declared the winner, his notice of contest should allege that he has received more legal votes than the contestee, and a failure to so allege is not a claim showing that the contestant is entitled to relief.Heth v. Armijo, 1972-NMSC-011, 83 N.M. 498, 494 P.2d 160.\n\nFunction and effect of prayerin election contests does not differ from that in ordinary civil actions.Heth v. Armijo, 1972-NMSC-011, 83 N.M. 498, 494 P.2d 160.\n\nPrayer to only determine relief sought or interpret ambiguity.— The prayer in election contests can be looked to and considered only to determine what relief is sought by the complaint, or to interpret any ambiguity in the complaint.Heth v. Armijo, 1972-NMSC-011, 83 N.M. 498, 494 P.2d 160.\n\nPrayer not to determine if complaint states cause of action.— The prayer cannot be taken into account to determine whether or not the body of the complaint states a cause of action in ordinary civil cases, and the same is true in election contests.Heth v. Armijo, 1972-NMSC-011, 83 N.M. 498, 494 P.2d 160.\n\nRules of civil procedure applyto election contests except when inconsistent.Heth v. Armijo, 1972-NMSC-011, 83 N.M. 498, 494 P.2d 160.\n\nQuo warranto proper action to contest municipal school board election.— Quo warranto was a proper action to bring since there was no provision in the Election Code or other related statutes providing for contests for municipal school board elections.State v. Rodriguez, 1958-NMSC-136, 65 N.M. 80, 332 P.2d 1005 (decided under former law).\n\nNames of voters need not be specified.— Names of persons whose ballots were fraudulently changed after returns of election need not be specified in notice of contest.Rogers v.

In the words of the statute, there is no \"office in controversy\" when the results of a primary are contested. It is the legal entitlement to the certificate of nomination which is in controversy.Eturriaga v. Valdez, 1963-NMSC-123, 109 N.M. 205, 784 P.2d 24.\n\nA primary election contest becomes moot,as a general rule, if not finally determined prior to the balloting in the general election.Eturriaga v.

McManus, 1961-NMSC-060, 68 N.M. 381, 362 P.2d 771.\n\nJudgment on pleadings when no answer filed.— District court properly rendered a judgment on the pleadings when contestee in election contest did not file and serve answer to notice of contest within 20 days from service of notice as required by former statute.Ostic v.

Graves, 2006-NMCA-030, 139 N.M. 143, 130 P.3d 204.\n\nConstitutional power of superintending control used where appeal inadequate.— Since the right to vote of large segments of the population would remain undetermined unless a case is at least allowed to proceed beyond its present initial stage, as distinguished from the ordinary election contest, involving more appealable issues, the power of superintending control, described in N.M. Const., art. VI, § 3, may be exercised. In cases (1) where the remedy by appeal seems wholly inadequate, and (2) where the use of the power is necessary to prevent irreparable mischief, great, extraordinary or exceptional hardship, costly delays and unusual burdens of expense, it may be exercised.Montoya v.

The voting system check shall be conducted for all federal offices, for governor, for contests in the regular local election and for the statewide elective office, other than the office of the governor, for which the winning candidate won by the smallest percentage margin of all candidates for statewide office in New Mexico.

The random sample shall be chosen in a process that will ensure, with at least ninety percent probability for the selected offices, that faulty tabulators would be detected if they would change the outcome of the election for a selected office. The auditor shall select precincts starting with the statewide office with the largest winning margin and ending with the precincts for the statewide office with the smallest winning margin and then, in the same manner, select precincts from each congressional district. The size of the random sample for each office shall be determined as provided in Table 1 of this subsection. When a precinct is selected for one office, it shall be used in lieu of selecting a different precinct when selecting precincts for another office in the same congressional district, or for any statewide office.

After selecting the random sample of precincts pursuant to Subsection B of this section or as required for a regular local election, the auditor shall also randomly select one precinct from each county where a precinct was not selected in the random sample.\n\nD. The auditor shall notify the appropriate county clerks of the precincts that are to be included in the voting system check upon their selection. The auditor shall direct the appropriate county clerks to open the locked ballot boxes and remove ballots from the selected precincts and:\n\n(1) in a primary or general election, the auditor shall direct the appropriate county clerks to compare the original machine count precinct vote totals for candidates for offices subject to the voting system check from the selected precincts for each office with the respective vote totals of a hand recount of the paper ballots from those precincts;\n\n(2) in a regular local election, the size of the random sample shall be the largest number of precincts that were used for the random sample in the previous general election.

The county clerks shall report their results to the auditor within fourteen days of the notice to conduct the voting system check unless a county clerk is aware of a recount in any office that includes one or more precincts in the county, in which case the county clerk shall report the results of the post-election audit to the auditor within fourteen days following the conclusion of the recount.\n\nF. Based on the results of the voting system check and any other auditing results, the auditor shall determine the error rate in the sample for each office. If the winning margin decreases and the error rate based on the difference between the vote totals of hand recounts of the paper ballots and the original precinct vote totals exceeds ninety percent of the winning margin for an office, another sample equal in size to the original sample shall be selected and the original precinct vote totals compared to the vote totals of hand recounts. The error rate based on the first and second sample shall be reported, and if it exceeds ninety percent of the winning margin for the office, the state canvassing board shall order that a full hand recount of the ballots for that office be conducted.\n\nG. The auditor shall report the results of the voting system check to the secretary of state upon completion of the voting system check and release the results to the public.\n\nH. Persons designated as county canvass observers may observe the hand recount described in Subsection D of this section. Observers shall comply with the procedures governing county canvass observers as provided in Section 1-2-31 NMSA 1978.\n\nI. If a recount for an office selected for a voting system check is conducted pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 1, Article 14 NMSA 1978, the vote totals from the hand count of ballots for that office in precincts selected for the voting system check may be used in lieu of recounting the same ballots for the recount.\n\nJ.

Madrid, 1930-NMSC-118, 35 N.M. 252, 294 P. 631,aff'd, 1932-NMSC-052, 36 N.M. 274, 36 N.M. 274, 13 P.2d 877.\n\nCounty to handle recount of officials elected by one county.— The intent of the legislature was that counties should handle all matters relating to officials who were elected by the electors of one county alone. The fact that a candidate is nominated by the electors of only one county determines the place where he is to file his declaration of candidacy, who is to issue his certificate of nomination and who is to fill a vacancy in case the nominated candidate dies or withdraws. It does not seem logical to assume that the legislature intended that a different standard was to prevail in the case of recount. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6478.\n\nAm.

An applicant for a recount shall deposit with the proper canvassing board or, in the case of an office for which the state canvassing board issues a certificate of nomination or election, with the secretary of state sufficient cash, or a sufficient surety bond, to cover the cost of a recount for each precinct for which a recount is demanded. An applicant for a recheck shall deposit with the proper canvassing board or, in the case of an office for which the state canvassing board issues a certificate of nomination or election, with the secretary of state sufficient cash, or a sufficient surety bond, to cover the cost of the recheck for each voting machine to be rechecked. The state canvassing board shall determine the estimated actual cost of a recount per polling place and for mailed ballots and a recheck per voting machine no later than March 15 of even-numbered years. The secretary of state shall post the recount and recheck cost determinations on the secretary of state's website when the state canvassing board issues its cost determinations.\n\nB. The deposit or surety bond shall be security for the payment of the costs and expenses of the recount or recheck in case the results of the recount or recheck are not sufficient to change the results of the election.\n\nC. If it appears that error or fraud sufficient to change the winner of the election has been committed, the costs and expenses of the recount or recheck shall be paid by the state upon warrant issued by the secretary of finance and administration supported by a voucher of the secretary of state, or shall be paid by the county upon warrant of the county clerk from the general fund of the county, as the case may be.\n\nD. If no error or fraud appears to be sufficient to change the winner, the costs and expenses for the recount or recheck shall be paid by the applicant. Costs shall consist of any docket fees, mileage of the sheriff in serving summons and fees and mileage of election board members, at the same rates allowed witnesses in civil actions. If error or fraud has been committed by an election board, the board members shall not be entitled to such mileage or fees.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 3-14-19, enacted by Laws 1978, ch. 48, § 1; 2001, ch. 109, § 1; 2005, ch. 270, § 77; 2007, ch. 336, § 18; 2023, ch. 39, § 74.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1978, ch. 48, § 1, repealed 3-14-19, 1953 Comp. (former 1-14-15 NMSA 1978), relating to recounts, rechecks and cost of proceedings, and enacted a new section.\n\nCross references.— For costs of election contests,see1-14-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor sheriff's fees in serving summons, etc.,see4-41-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor per diem expenses of sheriffs, etc.,see4-44-18 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor per diem and mileage for witnesses,see38-6-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, revised the provision related to the determination of the cost of a recount or recheck; in Subsection A, after \"actual cost of a recount per\", deleted \"precinct\" and added \"polling place and for mailed ballots\"; and in Subsection D, after \"mileage of\", deleted \"precinct\" and added \"election\", and after \"committed by\", deleted \"a precinct\" and added \"an election\"\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective April 2, 2007, in Subsection A, required a deposit of sufficient cash to cover the cost of a recount or recheck and provided that the canvassing board shall determine the estimated actual cost of a recount per precinct and a recheck per voting machine no later than March 15 of even-numbered years.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective July 1, 2005, in Subsection B, provided that the state canvassing board may condition the issuance of the summons on receipt of a part or all of the estimated costs of the recount or recheck.\n\nCompiler's note.—Cobb v. State Canvassing Board, 2006-NMSC-034, 140 N.M. 77, 140 P.3d 498, held the 2005 amendment to 1-14-15 NMSA 1978 unconstitutional and that Laws 2001, ch. 109, § 1 was still effective.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, in Subsection A, added the requirements that deposits for certain recounts or rechecks are to be deposited with the secretary of state; and substituted \"secretary of state\" for \"state canvassing board\" in Subsection C.\n\nUnconstitutional delegation.— The 2005 amendment to 1-14-15 NMSA 1978, which gave the state canvassing board discretionary authority, without adequate standards to guide its discretion, to condition any voting recount and recheck on advance payment of the full estimated costs of the procedures is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, with the result that the 2001 version of the statute is in effect.Cobb v. State Canvassing Board, 2006-NMSC-034, 140 N.M. 77, 140 P.3d 498.\n\nUnder the 2001 version of 1-14-15 NMSA 1978, the state canvassing board has no authority to require advance payment of the full estimated costs of a voting recount and recheck before starting the procedures.Cobb v. State Canvassing Board, 2006-NMSC-034, 140 N.M. 77, 140 P.3d 498.\n\nConstitutionality of recount and bond provisions.— Where plaintiffs, the libertarian party of New Mexico, the chair of the libertarian party of New Mexico, and Stephen Curtis, a libertarian party of New Mexico candidate for a position on the New Mexico court of appeals during the 2020 New Mexico primary election, filed an action alleging that the discretionary recount and bond provisions set forth in § 1-14-15 NMSA 1978, violate the first amendment, the equal protection clause, and the due process clause of the United States constitution, and where the plaintiffs demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence, through discrepancies between county canvass reports and state canvass reports, that fundamental unfairness in how New Mexico tabulates write-in ballots changed the election outcome for Mr. Curtis, and where the secretary of state could not proffer an explanation for the discrepancies, the court found that, although plaintiffs had a valid right-to-vote claim under the due process clause because they showed that a significant number of votes in the libertarian party primary election in Bernalillo county had not been counted, the discretionary recount provision does not violate the first amendment because the discretionary recount provision is a privilege and not a federal constitutional right and the bond requirement does not substantially burden voters rights to make free choices and to associate politically through the vote, that the discretionary recount provision does not violate the equal protection clause because the provision does not interfere with a fundamental right or discriminate against a suspect class and the bond requirement was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose of ensuring election fairness and accuracy, and that the discretionary recount provision and bond requirement do not render New Mexico's election process fundamentally unfair.Curtis v. Oliver, 479 F. Supp. 3d 1039 (D. N.M. 2020).\n\nBond in election contest proceeding was designed and intendedby legislature to afford security for the payment of costs which might be adjudged against the obligor in the bond. The bond was designed as a protection to the opposite party to secure him in the collection of any judgment for costs which he might recover.Montoya v. McManus, 1961-NMSC-060, 68 N.M. 381, 362 P.2d 771.\n\nPurpose was to require more in way of bond than written promise to pay.Montoya v. McManus, 1961-NMSC-060, 68 N.M. 381, 362 P.2d 771.\n\nTerm \"bond\"is commonly used in judicial procedure in connection with the giving of security for a stay of proceedings upon appeal or otherwise.Montoya v. McManus, 1961-NMSC-060, 68 N.M. 381, 362 P.2d 771.\n\nCorporate surety bond not required.— A bond with personal sureties complied with this section, requiring \"a sufficient surety bond,\" as a condition of a recount. The expression \"of commercial surety type\" means substantially the same as \"corporate surety type\" and to require such a bond is going beyond the legislative fiat.Montoya v. McManus, 1961-NMSC-060, 68 N.M. 381, 362 P.2d 771.\n\nState could not maintain action on bond to recover feesand mileage due to sheriff and election officials after recount, because state did not own the right sought to be enforced and judgment in its favor would not bar action by sheriff or election officials.State v. Barker, 1947-NMSC-010, 51 N.M. 51, 178 P.2d 401.\n\nIndividuals may qualify as suretieson the required bond.Sandoval v.
