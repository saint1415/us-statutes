XX, § 6.\n\nFor provision prohibiting abridging right of suffrage because of race, color or previous servitude,seeN.M. Const., art. XXI, § 5.\n\nBallot requirements to protect public.— In an effort to protect the public from the undesirable effects of an unrestrained nominating process, the legislature has seen fit to place certain requirements on the amount of public support a potential candidate must demonstrate before being placed on the ballot. There is no reason to suspect that these requirements are unreasonable.Bardacke v. Dunigan, 1982-NMSC-093,98 N.M. 473, 649 P.2d 1386.\n\n1927 act.— The 1927 act was a comprehensive Election Code.State ex rel. Abercrombie v. District Court of Fourth Judicial Dist., 1933-NMSC-057, 37 N.M. 407, 24 P.2d 265.\n\nApplicability to referendum.— Former Election Code, and especially Article 7 thereof relating to elections on constitutional amendments and other questions, included and applied to referendum.State v. Perrault, 1929-NMSC-099, 34 N.M. 438, 283 P. 902.\n\nSecrecy and purity of ballot to be protected.— Constitutional and statutory provisions calculated to protect the secrecy and purity of the ballot are to receive favorable consideration.State ex rel. Read v. Crist, 1919-NMSC-005, 25 N.M. 175, 179 P. 629.\n\nConstructions of election laws should further free exercise of franchise.— In construing election statutes, no construction of constitutional or statutory provisions is to be indulged which will defeat or unduly restrict or obstruct the free exercise of the elective franchise unless such is compelled by the strict letter of the law. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-139.\n\nLaw reviews.—For note, \"Why Gunaji v. Macias Matters to Candidates and Voters: Its Impact on New Mexico Election Law,\" see 33 N.M.L. Rev 431 (2003).\n\nAm.

      "text": "For the purpose of determining residence for voting, the place of residence is governed by the following rules:\n\nA. the residence of a person is that place in which his habitation is fixed, and to which, whenever he is absent, he has the intention to return;\n\nB. the place where a person's family resides is presumed to be his place of residence, but a person who takes up or continues his abode with the intention of remaining at a place other than where his family resides is a resident where he abides;\n\nC. a change of residence is made only by the act of removal joined with the intent to remain in another place. There can be only one residence;\n\nD. a person does not gain or lose residence solely by reason of his presence or absence while employed in the service of the United States or of this state, or while a student at an institution of learning, or while kept in an institution at public expense, or while confined in a public prison or while residing upon an Indian or military reservation;\n\nE. no member of the armed forces of the United States, his spouse or his dependent is a resident of this state solely by reason of being stationed in this state;\n\nF. a person does not lose his residence if he leaves his home and goes to another country, state or place within this state for temporary purposes only and with the intention of returning;\n\nG. a person does not gain a residence in a place to which he comes for temporary purposes only;\n\nH. a person loses his residence in this state if he votes in another state in an election requiring residence in that state, and has not upon his return regained his residence in this state under the provisions of the constitution of New Mexico;\n\nI. \"residence\" is computed by not including the day on which the person's residence commences and by including the day of the election;\n\nJ. a person does not acquire or lose residence by marriage only.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 3-1-6, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 240, § 6; 1973, ch. 70, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For residence not acquired or lost by presence or absence in federal or state service or as student,seeN.M. Const., art. VII, § 4.\n\nEstablishing physical presence.— Under Subsections C and H of this section, a person who does not have a sufficient physical presence in a place to qualify that place as an abode or a habitation (i.e., as a place where the person lives or resides, even if only part-time) must establish such a physical presence in the place - that is, he must \"remove\" to the place - before his voting residence can be changed to that place.Klumker v. Van Allred, 1991-NMSC-045, 112 N.M. 42, 811 P.2d 75.\n\nLoss of residence status.— A person who physically leaves the county where he has resided and then votes or qualifies to vote outside that county loses his residence in that county for voting purposes.Klumker v. Van Allred, 1991-NMSC-045, 112 N.M. 42, 811 P.2d 75.\n\nMultiple residences not precluded.— This section and 1-1-7.1 NMSA 1978 merely codify the supreme court's pronouncement inState ex rel. Magee v. Williams, 1953-NMSC-082, 57 N.M. 588, 261 P.2d 131, and do not preclude the possibility of multiple residences.Apodaca v. Chavez, 1990-NMSC-028, 109 N.M. 610, 788 P.2d 366.\n\nFamily home as permanent residence.— Political candidate's Santa Fe county family home remained his permanent residence, even though he maintained a home in Rio Arriba county where he resided with his wife and two children.Apodaca v. Chavez, 1990-NMSC-028, 109 N.M. 610, 788 P.2d 366.\n\nCircumstantial evidence of intent to reside sufficient.— It is obviously difficult to prove an intent to reside by direct evidence. Circumstantial evidence of intent is sufficient if it can be said that it amounts to substantial evidence.State ex rel. Huning v. Los Chavez Zoning Comm'n., 1982-NMSC-024, 97 N.M. 472, 641 P.2d 503,rev'g1979-NMSC-088, 93 N.M. 655, 604 P.2d 121.\n\nChange of residenceis accomplished only by the act of moving to another place coupled with the intent to remain in the other place.Kiehne v. Atwood, 1979-NMSC-098, 93 N.M. 657, 604 P.2d 123.\n\nResidence for voting similar to residence for jury service.— There is a similarity between residence for the purpose of voting and residence for the purpose of serving as a juror.State v. Watkins, 1979-NMCA-003, 92 N.M. 470, 590 P.2d 169.\n\nRight of Indian to vote.— There is nothing in the constitution or the statutes which prohibits an Indian from voting in a proper election, provided he fulfills the statutory requirements required of any other voter.Montoya v. Bolack, 1962-NMSC-073, 70 N.M. 196, 372 P.2d 387.\n\nReservation deemed residence for voting purposes.— A reservation lying within geographic boundaries of the state is a part of the state, and residence for voting purposes, within the meaning of the constitution, follows.Montoya v. Bolack, 1962-NMSC-073, 70 N.M. 196, 372 P.2d 387.\n\nPolling places may be placed on reservations.— Inasmuch as there is residence on a reservation for voting purposes, there is no prohibition to the location of polling places thereon.Montoya v. Bolack, 1962-NMSC-073, 70 N.M. 196, 372 P.2d 387.\n\nVote cast outside residence of voter is void;it must be cast in person in the precinct in which the voter has resided for the preceding 30 days.State ex rel. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1954-NMSC-124, 59 N.M. 9, 277 P.2d 960;Arledge v. Mabry, 1948-NMSC-047, 52 N.M. 303, 197 P.2d 884.\n\nFranchise cannot be conferred on nonresident.— Former statute purporting to make residents living on condemned lands residents of New Mexico in the constitutional sense did not aid person living on condemned lands at Los Alamos project, since legislature could not constitutionally confer the elective franchise on persons whose legal status was that of a nonresident.Arledge v. Mabry, 1948-NMSC-047, 52 N.M. 303, 197 P.2d 884.\n\nCandidate to file in district where he resides.— In order for a candidate for county commission or state representative to qualify for those offices, he must file in the district where he resides. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-30.\n\nChange of residence by candidate.— In order to run in a certain district, a candidate can change his residency at any time up to the filing date, so long as the legislative district is in the same county. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-30.\n\nThose residing on former public domain land may exercise elective franchisein both state and federal elections, since the state retained jurisdiction over the area not inconsistent with federal use. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-123.\n\nNo residence on purchased without consent of state.— Those people residing on land obtained by the United States through the constitutional method may not establish their residency so as to become electors; those residing on lands obtained by purchase without obtaining the consent of the state are in a similar position. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-123.\n\nEstablishing residence.— \"Residence\" for voting and election purposes is established initially by actual residence and intent to make that place a home. After \"residence\" is thus established, the person may move elsewhere, and if he intends to return, his \"residence\" for voting and election purposes remains as established. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6445.\n\nFor those residing upon lands within military installations which formerly were part of public domain,\"residence\" for voting purposes could be established thereon. The reasoning behind this conclusion is that the state of New Mexico, as to these lands, exercised concurrent jurisdiction with the federal government even though title was held by the federal government. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6425.\n\nTerm \"residence\"has been defined as being synonymous with home or domicile denoting the permanent dwelling place to which a party, when absent, intends to return and also as \"that place wherein he legally resides and has his domicile and from which, when temporarily absent, he intends to return.\" 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6208.\n\nNo residence for those on lands over which federal government has control.— On any lands over which the United States government has acquired exclusive control, except for the purpose of service of civil and criminal process, no residence can be acquired for the purpose of voting. 1953 Op.

Supp. 989 (D.N.M. 1988).\n\nVariance between petition and registration.— This section does not include as a reason for disqualification the failure to provide on the petition the signatory's name or address printed as registered. Therefore, where a county clerk automatically excluded signatures of registered voters whose names and addresses on the petitions varied somewhat or differed from their affidavits of registration, there was a failure to comply with the statutory requirements.Workers World Party v. Vigil-Giron, 693 F. Supp. 989 (D.N.M. 1988).\n\nSignature to contain address, etc., to be valid.— Any signature on a nominating petition not containing the address, county and precinct number of the elector is invalid. 1952 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 52-5486 (opinion rendered under former law).",

The Election Code applies to the following:\n\n(1) general elections;\n\n(2) primary elections;\n\n(3) special elections;\n\n(4) elections to fill vacancies in the office of United States representative;\n\n(5) local elections included in the Local Election Act; and\n\n(6) recall elections of county officers, school board members or applicable municipal officers.\n\nB. To the extent procedures are incorporated or adopted by reference by separate laws governing such elections or to the extent procedures are not specified by such laws, certain provisions of the Election Code shall also apply to special district elections not covered by the Local Election Act [Chapter 1, Article 22 NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 3-1-18, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 240, § 19; 1975, ch. 255, § 6; 1977, ch. 222, § 4; 1985, ch. 168, § 1; 2018, ch. 79, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For primary elections,see1-8-10 to 1-8-44 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor election of representative in congress,see1-15-17 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor school district elections,see1-22-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor municipal elections,see3-8-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2018 amendment,effective July 1, 2018, added certain recall elections to the list of elections covered by the Election Code, and made conforming changes as a result of the enactment of the Local Election Act; in Subsection A, Paragraph A(3), deleted \"statewide\" preceding \"special elections\", in Paragraph A(4), after \"in the office of\", added \"United States\", after \"representative\", deleted \"in congress; and\", in Paragraph A(5), deleted \"school district\" and added \"local\", and after \"elections\", added \"included in the Local Election Act; and\", and added Paragraph A(6); and in Subsection B, deleted former Paragraph B(1) and paragraph designation \"(2)\", after \"shall also apply to\", added \"special district officer or special district bond or other\", and after \"special district elections\", added \"not covered by the Local Election Act\".\n\nApplication of the Election Code to public improvement district formation elections.— The Election Code's thirty-day limitation period for filing a complaint to contest an election applies to a public improvement district formation election under the Public Improvement District Act.Glaser v. LeBus, 2012-NMSC-012, 276 P.3d 959.\n\nWhere the petitioners filed a complaint to contest an election to form a public improvement district under the Public Improvement District Act thirteen months after the election, the action was barred by the thirty-day limitation for filing a complaint to contest an election under the Election Code.Glaser v. LeBus, 2012-NMSC-012, 276 P.3d 959.\n\nScope of section.— County official recall elections are not listed in this section.Sparks v. Graves, 2006-NMCA-030, 139 N.M. 143, 130 P.3d 204.\n\nWrite-in candidates in conservancy district elections.— Conservancy district board rule prohibiting write-in candidates for election to the board is invalid as contrary to the legislative intent expressed by this section, making the Election Code, Chapter 1, NMSA 1978, applicable to special district elections and to the constitutional mandate in N.M. Const., art. II, § 8 of \"free and open\" elections.Gonzales v. Middle Rio Grande Conservancy Dist., 1987-NMCA-125, 106 N.M. 426, 744 P.2d 554.\n\nPublic improvement district formation elections.— The formation election provisions of the Public Improvement District Act incorporate the election contest procedures of the Election Code.Glaser v. LeBus, 2012-NMCA-028, 274 P.3d 114.\n\nSpecial school bond election is not \"special election\" or \"municipal election\"within statutes so that the word \"election\" should apply to all special and municipal elections and so that no person should vote in any special or municipal election unless registered, and voters otherwise qualified were entitled to vote in special school bond election, although not registered.Johnston v. Board of Educ., 1958-NMSC-141, 65 N.M. 147, 333 P.2d 1051.\n\nWords \"general election,\"used in act providing for method of changing name of a municipality, contemplated the biennial election for choosing state and county officials and national representatives in congress.Benson v. Williams, 1952-NMSC-074, 56 N.M. 560, 246 P.2d 1046.\n\nElections for board of directors of conservancy district.— A person cannot stand for election for the board of directors of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District if that person resides in a county in which part of the district is located but outside the district itself. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-34.",
