      "text": "A. Any major political party in New Mexico, as defined in Section 1-7-7 NMSA 1978, shall nominate its candidates, other than its presidential candidates, by secret ballot at the next succeeding primary election as prescribed in the Primary Election Law [1-8-10 to 1-8-52 NMSA 1978].\n\nB. Any minor political party in New Mexico, as defined in Section 1-7-7 NMSA 1978, shall nominate candidates for public office in the manner prescribed in its party rules and regulations and according to the provisions of the Election Code [Chapter 1 NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 3-8-1, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 240, § 151; 1975, ch. 255, § 99; 2003, ch. 300, § 1; 2014, ch. 40, § 2; 2014, ch. 81, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For qualified political party,see1-7-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2014 amendment,effective March 12, 2014, changed statutory references to definitions of major and minor political parties; and in Subsections A and B, changed \"1-1-9\" to \"1-7-7\".\n\nLaws 2014, ch. 40, § 2, effective March 7, 2014, and Laws 2014, ch. 81, § 2, effective March 12, 2014, enacted identical amendments to this section. The section was set out as amended by Laws 2014, ch. 81, § 2.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, inserted \"other than its presidential candidates\" following \"shall nominate its candidates,\" near the middle of Subsection A.\n\nPrimary Election Law not violative of equal protection clause of U.S. constitution.— Although plaintiff complains that Democrats seeking nomination face an unconstitutionally more onerous burden than do other political party candidates because the greater number of Democrats in New Mexico requires that a greater number of signatures be obtained on nominating petitions, only invidious discrimination violates the United States constitution, and this statute must be sustained if a valid public purpose can be shown for the statute, and limitation of the number of names on the ballot remains a valid consideration. The New Mexico Primary Election Law does not violate the equal protection clause.Dillon v. Evans, 549 F.2d 183 (10th Cir. 1977).\n\nCandidates not required to be registered electors of party.— Candidates nominated by a political party, not required to be nominated at the primary election, are not required to be registered electors of such minority party.State ex rel. Chavez v. Evans, 1968-NMSC-167, 79 N.M. 578, 446 P.2d 445 (decided under former law).\n\nApplicability to nonpartisan ticket in municipal election.— Former act relating to political party organization and nominating procedures did not apply to nonpartisan tickets offered in a municipal election.Hampton v. Priddy, 1946-NMSC-010, 50 N.M. 23, 168 P.2d 100.\n\nWrite-in method not permissible.— Write-in method of nominating candidates was not permissible under former Primary Election Law.State ex rel. Van Schoyck v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1942-NMSC-061, 46 N.M. 472, 131 P.2d 278.\n\nProvision limiting selection and nomination methods required reasonable construction.— Provision of former primary election statute that candidates \"shall not be otherwise selected or nominated\" required a reasonable, albeit strict, construction.State ex rel. Van Schoyck v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1942-NMSC-061, 46 N.M. 472, 131 P.2d 278.\n\nFilling vacancy by party committee is exception.— Former provision for filling of vacancy after primary by party committee operated as an exception to statute requiring candidates to be nominated at primary election and required strict construction.State ex rel. Van Schoyck v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1942-NMSC-061, 46 N.M. 472, 131 P.2d 278.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Judicial Selection in New Mexico: A Hybrid of Commission Nomination and Partisan Election,\" see 30 N.M.L.

Constitutional Amendment 1 was adopted by a vote of 445,655 for and 355,471 against.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective April 3, 2019, replaced \"governor\" with \"secretary of state\" with regard to issuing the general election proclamation, and limited the section to general elections; replaced each occurrence of \"governor\" with \"secretary of state\" throughout the section; and replaced each occurrence of \"primary\" with \"general\" throughout the section.\n\nThe 2014 amendment,effective March 12, 2014, provided for standardized filing dates; required that petitions be signed by one percent of the votes cast for governor at the general election; provided qualifications for candidates; in Subsection B, in the first paragraph, after \"filed on the\", deleted \"twenty-first\" and added \"twenty-third\", after \"accompanied by\", deleted \"a petition containing a list of signatures and addresses of voters\" and added \"nominating petitions containing the signatures of voters\", after \"number of votes cast\", added \"for governor\", and after \"preceding general election\", deleted \"for the office of governor or president of the United States, as the case may be\" and added \"at which a governor was elected\", and in the second paragraph, after \"residents of the\" deleted \"state, district, county or\"; in Subsection C, in the first paragraph, after \"filed on the\", deleted \"twenty-first\" and added \"twenty-third\", after \"shall be accompanied by a\", added \"nominating\", after \"petition containing\" deleted \"a list of\" and added \"the\", after \"petition containing the signatures\", deleted \"and addresses\", after \"votes cast\" added \"for governor\", and after \"general election\", deleted \"for the office of governor or president of the United States, as the case may be\" and added \"at which a governor is elected\"; and in the second paragraph, after \"residents of the\", deleted \"state, district, county or\"; in Subsection D, at the beginning of the sentence, added \"Except in the case of a political party certified in the year of the election\", after \"persons certified as\", deleted \"nominees\" and added \"candidates\", and after \"of that party\" deleted \"before\" and added \"on\"; added Subsection E; and in Subsection F, after \"the number of\", deleted \"minor party\".\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective April 2, 2007, in Subsection B, changed the date that the names certified to the secretary of state be filed from the second Tuesday in July to the twenty-first day following the primary election; and in Subsection C, required the names certified to the county clerk be filed on the twenty-first day following the primary election.\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective March 6, 1998, inserted \", public regulation commission\" in Paragraph A(1).\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective January 1, 1996, substituted \"less than one percent\" for \"less than one-half of one percent\" in Subsections B and C, rewrote Subsection D which previously read \"Such persons certified as nominees shall be members of that party as shown by their certificates of registration, at the time their names are certifed\", and made a minor stylistic change in Subsection E.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, substituted \"certificates\" for \"affidavits\" in Subsection D.

When the name of a nominee is filed as provided in this section, the name shall be placed on the general election ballot as the party's candidate for that office.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 3-8-8, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 240, § 158; 1975, ch. 255, § 103; 1979, ch. 378, § 6; 1995, ch. 124, § 11; 2011, ch. 137, § 51; 2015, ch. 145, § 51; 2017, ch. 101, § 8; 2019, ch. 212, § 89; 2023, ch. 39, § 44.\n\nCross references.— For printing of ballots, time of,see1-10-4 and 1-10-5 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, clarified the required forms and time for filling a vacancy on a general election ballot occurring after a primary; in Subsection A, after \"primary election, but\", deleted \"seventy\" and added \"ninety\"; and in Subsection D, after \"proper filing officer\", added \"on or before the seventieth day prior to a general election\", and after \"prescribed by the secretary of state\", deleted \"at least sixty-three days prior to the general election\".\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective April 3, 2019, required additional documents be included with the form for filling vacancies, and replaced \"governor\" with \"secretary of state\" with regard to issuing the general election proclamation; in Subsection A, in the introductory clause, replaced each occurrence of \"governor\" with \"secretary of state's general election\"; and in Subsection D, after \"general election,\", added \"along with a declaration of candidacy subscribed and sworn by the selected nominee and the required form for candidates pursuant to the Campaign Reporting Act.\"\n\nThe 2017 amendment,effective June 16, 2017, changed the deadline for filling a vacancy on a general election ballot when a vacancy occurs after the primary, changed the deadline by which appointments to fill such vacancies are made, and provided for the secretary of state to approve the form on which appointments to fill such vacancies are made and filed; in Subsection A, in the introductory paragraph, after \"after a primary election\", added \"but seventy or more days before the general election\"; and in Subsection D, after \"shall be made and filed\", added \"with the proper filing officer using a form approved by the secretary of state\", and after \"at least\", deleted \"fifty-six\" and added \"sixty-three\".\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective July 1, 2015, required that the county or state central committee making an appointment to fill a vacancy on a general election ballot, occurring after the primary, include members residing within the boundaries of the area to be represented by the public office; and added a new Subsection C and redesignated the succeeding subsections accordingly.\n\nThe 2011 amendment,effective July 1, 2011, provided for filling the vacancy in a new public office that was not included in the governor's proclamation; required that appointments to vacancies qualify pursuant to Section 1-8-18 NMSA 1978; eliminated the five day deadline for filling a vacancy caused by the death of a nominee; and eliminated the requirement that a nominee's name be pasted over the name of the initial candidate when the nominee is appointed after the ballot has been printed.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective January 1, 1996, added Subsection B and redesignated former Subsections B and C as Subsections C and D.\n\nNomination for a district court judicial position,which is a state position, not a county position, must be filled by a state central committee and not by a county central committee.Johnson v. Vigil-Giron, 2006-NMSC-051, 140 N.M. 667, 146 P.3d 312.\n\nNo vacancy occurs if there is no primary candidate.— Where the Republican Party did not run a primary election candidate for the position of state representative, a vacancy did not exist on the general election ballot for the Republican Party to fill.Johnson v. Vigil-Giron, 2006-NMSC-051, 140 N.M. 667, 146 P.3d 312.\n\nNotice of withdrawal as candidate.— There are no formal requirements for the withdrawal of candidates from a general election and the secretary of state may rely on a candidate's press release that the candidate has withdrawn from the general election.Johnson v. Vigil-Giron, 2006-NMSC-051, 140 N.M. 667, 146 P.3d 312.\n\nFifty-six day rule of Subsection B (now C) invalid.— The fifty-six day restriction placed upon political party central committees by Subsection B (now C) is inconsistent with the panoply of rights provided in the remainder of Chapter 1, the Election Code; because its enforcement would result in unjust, absurd or unreasonable consequences, it cannot stand.Thompson v. Robinson, 1984-NMSC-096, 101 N.M. 703, 688 P.2d 21.\n\nSection only authorizes filling of vacancies after primary.— Section 1-8-7 NMSA 1978 and this section only authorize the filling of vacancies on the party tickets for elective offices after the holding of the primary election.State ex rel. Robinson v. King, 1974-NMSC-028, 86 N.M. 231, 522 P.2d 83.\n\nVacancies for county offices.— Since no candidate appeared on democratic primary ballot for county superintendent of schools because candidate who filed for office was declared ineligible prior to election, the party's county executive committee did not have right to designate a successor candidate to appear on general election ticket.Granito v. Grace, 1952-NMSC-088, 56 N.M. 652, 248 P.2d 210 (decided under former law).\n\nSection as exception to nominating candidates at primary.— Former provision for filling of vacancy after primary by party committee operated as an exception to statute requiring candidates to be nominated at primary election and required strict construction.State ex rel. Van Schoyck v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1942-NMSC-061, 46 N.M. 472, 131 P.2d 278.\n\nVacancy cannot be filled if no candidate nominated at primary.— Former statute did not permit selection of candidate after primary when there was no candidate for nomination in the primary.State ex rel. Van Schoyck v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1942-NMSC-061, 46 N.M. 472, 131 P.2d 278.\n\nConstitutionality.— This section meets the strict scrutiny test and serves a compelling state interest.Skeen v. Hooper, 631 F.2d 707 (10th Cir. 1980).\n\nNominations after death of unopposed candidate.— When an unopposed candidate died before general election, only his political party may select a nominee for the general election.Skeen v. Hooper, 631 F.2d 707 (10th Cir. 1980).\n\nResignation of appeals judge after primary.— The office of any court of appeals judge who resigns after the 1988 primary election is not subject to the central committee nomination procedures in this section; the governor must appoint someone to fill the unexpired term. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-52.\n\nFifty-six day time limit applicable to resignations after primary.— While the fifty-six day limit of Subsection B (now C) is \"impossible of performance\" or \"impractical\" in the case of vacancies in nominations created by successful election contests, there is no reason why it would be unreasonable, unjust or absurd to require the appropriate central committees to conform to that time period in filling vacancies created by resignations after the June, 1988 primary election. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-52.\n\nA prospective, unconditional resignation that takes effect within the fifty-six day time limit but before the general election, creates a present vacancy in the ballot that the appropriate party central committee may fill in accordance with this section. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-52.\n\nCommittee authority exercisable only in event of vacancy.— The authority of a state central committee of a political party to select a nominee for an office, to be voted upon at a general election, exists only in the event that there is a vacancy in the list of the party's nominees for that office. 1980 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 80-31.\n\nWhen there has been no party nominee for an office, there is no vacancy in the list of nominees to be filled by the committee. 1980 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 80-31.\n\nCongressional nominations.— When a political party's state central committee is performing the function of choosing a nominee for the office of United States representative under this section, only the members from the congressional district to be represented by the nominee are eligible to vote. 1980 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 80-30.\n\nSection only authorizes filling of vacancies after primary.— This section applies in the case in which the position to be voted upon in the general election does not become \"vacant\" until after the primary. 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-05.\n\nWhen vacancy occurs in position that could not have been subject to primary procedure,the responsibility for selecting the nominees falls to the political parties. 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-05.\n\nVacancies in single county and multicounty districts.— The intent of this section was to allow the county central committee to fill all candidate vacancies that occur in a district that is entirely within the county. Where the district involved is composed of a multicounty district, the intent is to allow the state central committee to fill any vacancies that may occur. 1974 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 74-33.\n\nIn the case of a judicial district which is a multicounty one, the state central committee names the nominees. If the judicial district is composed of a single county, then the nominee is to be selected by the county central committee. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-49.\n\nParty committee may not nominate candidate if no primary candidate.— If a political party to which the primary election laws apply did not have a candidate for a particular office at the primary election, its committee could not select a nominee for the office after the primary election. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-64 (opinion rendered under former law).\n\nNo filing fee necessary for filling vacancy after primary.— Persons selected to fill in vacancies occurring after the primary election need not pay a filing fee in order to have their names appear on the general election ballot. 1948 Op.

Toulouse Oliver, 2020-NMSC-012.\n\nA nominating petition for magistrate judgeship must include the division number of the judgeship that the candidate seeks.Charley v.

McDaniel, 1984-NMSC-049, 101 N.M. 260, 680 P.2d 977 (decided prior to 1999 amendment).\n\nNominating petition filing requirement not violative of equal protection.— States may impose on minor political parties the precondition of demonstrating the existence of some reasonable quantum of voter support by requiring such parties to file petitions for a place on the ballot signed by a percentage of those who voted in a prior election. Consequently, 1-8-33 NMSA 1978 is not repugnant to the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment, since the percentage requirements are identical for the different political parties, all candidates of the same party running for the same office must acquire the same number of signatures, and any disparity in the number of signatures required as between the different parties merely accentuates the basic fairness of the procedure in recognizing the variation in the number of registered voters affiliated with the numerous parties in this state.Dillon v. King, 1974-NMSC-096, 87 N.M. 79, 529 P.2d 745.\n\nFiling requirement discourages \"laundry list\" ballots.— \"Laundry list\" ballots discourage voter participation and confuse and frustrate those who participate. Rational results within the framework of our system are not likely to be reached if the ballot for a single office must list a dozen or more aspirants who are relatively unknown or have no prospects for success. Our electoral history vividly demonstrates that unrestricted primaries foster a rank and verdant growth of candidates.Dillon v. King, 1974-NMSC-096, 87 N.M. 79, 529 P.2d 745.\n\nLegitimate state interest.— Free and open elections do not require a total lack of restraint on the number of political parties and nominees entitled to placement on the ballot. The state has a legitimate interest in trying to determine some degree of good faith on the part of electors who sign nominating petitions, in assuring at least a modicum of support for a political party and its nominees whose names are placed on the general election ballot, and in regulating the size of the ballot so as to minimize voter confusion and to prevent the overwhelming of voting machines.Dillon v. King, 1974-NMSC-096, 87 N.M. 79, 529 P.2d 745.\n\nScope of section.— This section is limited by its language to nominating petitions for primary elections.Workers World Party v. Vigil-Giron, 693 F. Supp. 989 (D.N.M. 1988).\n\nLanguage mandatory.— The language of this section is mandatory and not discretionary and any nominating petition not containing the address of the candidate and his official designation on each sheet is invalid. 1952 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 52-5486 (opinion rendered under former law).\n\nCandidate's name on petition.— So long as the name of the candidate upon the nominating petition reasonably and sufficiently identifies the declarant or candidate and so long as there is no patent discrepancy between the name on the nominating petition and the name on the declaration of candidacy, the petition is valid and acceptable. 1952 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 52-5486 (opinion rendered under former law).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 26 Am. Jur. 2d Elections §§ 236, 237.\n\n29 C.J.S. Elections § 112.",

Nominating petitions for those candidates shall be signed by a number of voters equal to at least two percent of the total vote of the candidate's party in the state or congressional district, or the following number of voters, whichever is greater: for statewide offices, two hundred thirty voters; and for congressional candidates, seventy-seven voters.\n\nC. Nominating petitions for candidates for any other office to be voted on at the primary election for which nominating petitions are required shall be signed by a number of voters equal to at least the greater of:\n\n(1) for the public education commission, two percent of the total vote of the candidate's party in the district; for judicial candidates, two percent of the total vote of the candidate's party in the district or division; and for all other candidates, three percent of the total vote of the candidate's party in the district; or\n\n(2) for metropolitan court and magistrate courts, ten voters; for the public education commission, twenty-five voters; for state representative, ten voters; for state senator, seventeen voters; and for district attorney and district judge, fifteen voters.\n\nD. A candidate who fails to receive the preprimary convention designation that the candidate sought may collect additional signatures to total at least four percent of the total vote of the candidate's party in the state or congressional district, whichever applies to the office the candidate seeks, and file a new declaration of candidacy and nominating petitions for the office for which the candidate failed to receive a preprimary designation. The declaration of candidacy and nominating petitions shall be filed with the secretary of state either ten days following the date of the preprimary convention at which the candidate failed to receive the designation or on the date all declarations of candidacy and nominating petitions are due pursuant to the provisions of the Primary Election Law, whichever is later.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 3-8-24.4, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 228, § 7; 1975, ch. 255, § 110; Laws 1975, ch. 295, § 17; 1979, ch. 378, § 9, 1982, ch. 1, § 2; Laws 1985, ch. 2, § 6; 1985, ch. 206, § 2; 1987, ch. 216, § 1; 1993, ch. 55, § 7; 1994, ch. 92, § 5; 1995, ch. 124, § 16; 1998, ch. 36, § 5; 2007, ch. 337, § 10; 2008, ch. 57, § 1; 2020, ch. 9, § 5; 2023, ch. 39, § 50.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, reduced the nominating petition signature requirement for the public education commission and for judicial candidates; in Subsection C, Paragraph C(1), added \"for the public education commission, two percent of the total vote of the candidate's party in the district; for judicial candidates, two percent of the total vote of the candidate's party in the district or division; and for all other candidates\", and after \"the candidate's party in the district\", deleted \"or division, or the following number of voters, whichever is greater\".\n\nThe 2020 amendment,effective January 1, 2023, removed the public regulation commission from the calculation of petition signatures needed to run in a primary election; and in Subsection C, after \"ten voters\", deleted \"for the public regulation commission, fifty voters\".\n\nLaws 2020, ch. 9, § 5 amended 1-8-33 NMSA 1978, effective January 1, 2023, contingent upon the adoption of Laws 2019, SJC/SRC/SJR Nos. 1 and 4, Constitutional Amendment 1, at the general election held on November 3, 2020. Constitutional Amendment 1 was adopted by a vote of 445,655 for and 355,471 against.\n\nThe 2008 amendment,effective February 29, 2008, added Subsection D.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective July 1, 2007, eliminated the procedure by which a candidate who failed to receive a preprimary convention designation could obtain a declaration of candidacy and nominating petition.\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective March 6, 1998, inserted \"; for the public regulation commission, fifty voters\" in Subsection C.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective January 1, 1996, in Subsection B, deleted \"do not\" preceding \"seek\", substituted \"two\" for \"three\", and substituted the language beginning \"or the following number\" at the end for \"as the case may be\"; in Subsection C, substituted the language beginning \"or the following number of voters\" at the end for \"as the case may be\"; and in Subsection D, substituted \"additional signatures to total at least four percent\" for \"signatures equal to at least three percent\" and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nThe 1994 amendment,effective January 1, 1996, in Subsection B, inserted the first sentence and substituted \"those candidates\" for \"a candidate for United States senator, any statewide officer or any candidate for United States representative\" in the second sentence; deleted former Subsection D relating to the submission of nominating petitions and redesignated former Subsection E as Subsection D; and substituted \"equal to at least three\" for \"from an additional one\" in Subsection D.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective November 15, 1993, substituted \"As used in this section, 'Total vote' means the sum of all votes cast for all of\" for \"The basis of percentage for the votes of the party in each instance referred to in this section shall be the total vote for\" at the beginning of Subsection A, deleted \"provided that in determining the total vote of the party on the nominating petition for a candidate for member of the legislature, absentee votes shall be excluded\" at the end of Subsection C, and added Subsections D and E.\n\nNominating petition signature requirement not violative of equal protection.— States may impose on minor political parties the precondition of demonstrating the existence of some reasonable quantum of voter support by requiring such parties to file petitions for a place on the ballot signed by a percentage of those who voted in a prior election. Consequently, this section is not repugnant to the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment, since the percentage requirements are identical for the different political parties, all candidates of the same party running for the same office must acquire the same number of signatures, and any disparity in the number of signatures required as between the different parties merely accentuates the basic fairness of the procedure in recognizing the variation in the number of registered voters affiliated with the numerous parties in this state.Dillon v. King, 1974-NMSC-096, 87 N.M. 79, 529 P.2d 745.\n\nSignature requirement discourages \"laundry list\" ballots.— \"Laundry list\" ballots discourage voter participation and confuse and frustrate those who participate. Rational results within the framework of our system are not likely to be reached if the ballot for a single office must list a dozen or more aspirants who are relatively unknown or have no prospects for success. Our electoral history vividly demonstrates that unrestricted primaries foster a rank and verdant growth of candidates.Dillon v. King, 1974-NMSC-096, 87 N.M. 79, 529 P.2d 745.\n\nLegitimate state interest.— Free and open elections do not require a total lack of restraint on the number of political parties and nominees entitled to placement on the ballot. The state has a legitimate interest in trying to determine some degree of good faith on the part of electors who sign nominating petitions, in assuring at least a modicum of support for a political party and its nominees whose names are placed on the general election ballot, and in regulating the size of the ballot so as to minimize voter confusion and to prevent the overwhelming of voting machines.Dillon v. King, 1974-NMSC-096, 87 N.M. 79, 529 P.2d 745.\n\nOfficial canvass record used in determining number of signatures required.— In determining the number of signatures required under former 3-11-7, 1953 Comp. to be contained in a petition for nomination the official canvass is to be the record that is used. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-35.",
