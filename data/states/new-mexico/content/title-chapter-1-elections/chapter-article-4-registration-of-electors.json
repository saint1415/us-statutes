No. 59-170.\n\nSection to be construed liberally.— Registration is required in order to exercise the privilege to vote, and it is a well accepted principle that registration statutes should be construed liberally in favor of the franchise. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-169.\n\nPurpose of section to obtain complete registration.— It is the purpose of this section to obtain as complete a registration as possible. In keeping with this policy, the county clerks or registration officials have discretion in the matter of delivering affidavits of registration to responsible persons in order to effectuate a more complete registration of those entitled to vote. 1959 Op.
