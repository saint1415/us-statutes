1981, ch. 331, § 1; 1985, ch. 2, § 10; 1993, ch. 46, § 1; 1993, ch. 55, § 12; 1993, ch. 314, § 58; 1995, ch. 153, § 1; 1997, ch. 112, § 2; 2003, ch. 66, § 1; 2009, ch. 67, § 1; 2009, ch. 68, § 2; 2019, ch. 262, § 4;

added a new Subsection C and redesignated former Subsections C through J as Subsections D through K, respectively; added new Subsections L and M and redesignated former Subsections K through O as Subsections N through R, respectively; and added a new Subsection S and redesignated former Subsections P through V as Subsections T through Z, respectively.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective July 1, 2019, defined \"advertisement\", \"ballot question\", \"campaign expenditure\", \"coordinated expenditure\", \"independent expenditure\", \"legislative caucus committee\", and \"political party\", and revised and removed the definitions of certain terms, as used in the Campaign Reporting Act; deleted former Subsection A, which defined \"advertising campaign\", and added a new Subsection A; added a new Subsection C and redesignated former Subsections C and D as Subsections D and E, respectively; in Subsection D, after \"financial institution\", deleted \"located in New Mexico\" and added \"regulated by the United States or a state of the United States\"; in Subsection E, after \"authorized by a candidate to\", deleted \"raise, collect or expend contributions\" and added \"act\", and after \"office;\", added \"provided that a candidate shall not authorize more than one campaign committee\"; added a new Subsection F and redesignated former Subsections E and F as Subsections G and H, respectively; in Subsection G, in the introductory clause, after \"declaration of candidacy\" deleted \"or nominating petition\" and added \"and has not subsequently filed a statement of withdrawal\", in Paragraph G(2), after \"made expenditures of\", deleted \"two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500)\", after \"more\", added \"than three thousand dollars \"($3,000)\", after \"make expenditures of\", deleted \"two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500)\", and after \"more\", added \"than three thousand dollars ($3,000)\"; in Subsection H, added paragraph designations \"(1)\" and \"(3)\" and Paragraphs H(2) and H(4); added a new Subsection I and redesignated former Subsections G through J as Subsections J through M, respectively; in Subsection M, after \"pre-primary convention\", deleted \"but does not include the administrative or solicitation expenses of a political committee that are paid by an organization that sponsors the committee\"; added new Subsections N and O and redesignated former Subsections K and L as Subsections P and Q, respectively; in Subsection Q, after \"means\", deleted the remainder of the introductory clause, deleted former Paragraphs (1) through (3), and added new Paragraphs Q(1) through Q(4);

inserted \"political committee\" near the end of Subsection L; added designations Paragraphs L(1) to L(3); deleted \"provided that a political committee includes\" at the end of Paragraph L(1); substituted \"five hundred dollars ($500)\" for \"two thousand dollars ($2,000)\" in Paragraph L(3);

and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, rewrote the section to the extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nCampaign Reporting Act's \"appeal to vote\" definition is neither overbroad nor unconstitutionally vague.— Plaintiffs, arguing that the Campaign Reporting Act's definition of \"independent expenditure\" as an expenditure for an advertisement \"susceptible to no other reasonable interpretation than as anappeal to votefor or against a clearly identified candidate or ballot question\" was overbroad and vague, failed to establish that the definition in NMSA 1978, § 1-19-26(N)(3)(b) prohibited a substantial amount of protected speech. The Campaign Reporting Act's definition of \"appeal to vote\" in § 1-19-26(N)(3)(b), therefore, is neither overbroad nor unconstitutionally vague.Republican Party of N.M. v. Torrez, ___ F.Supp.3d ___ (D. N.M. 2023).\n\nCampaign Reporting Act's \"electioneering communication\" definition is neither overbroad nor unconstitutionally vague.— Where plaintiffs challenged as overbroad and vague the Campaign Reporting Act's definition of \"independent expenditure\" as an expenditure for an advertisement that \"refers to a clearly identified candidate or ballot question and is published and disseminated to the relevant electorate in New Mexico within thirty days before the primary election or sixty days before the general election at which the candidate or ballot question is on the ballot\", and where plaintiffs argued that this definition, in NMSA 1978, 1-19-26(N)(3)(c), requires disclosure of all communications about a candidate or a ballot measure that are made close to an election, regardless of whether the speech qualifies as express advocacy and regardless of whether the communication is cabined in terms of medium and number of viewers targeted, plaintiffs failed in their burden of showing a substantial number of applications of the Campaign Reporting Act's definition of \"independent expenditure\" are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep. The Campaign Reporting Act's definition of \"electioneering communication\" in § 1-19-26(N)(3)(c), therefore, is neither overbroad nor unconstitutionally vague.Republican Party of N.M. v. Torrez, ___ F.Supp.3d ___ (D. N.M. 2023).\n\nDefining political committee.— The secretary of state cannot regulate as political committees those organizations which do not engage in express advocacy or the functional equivalent of advocacy for the election or defeat of candidates. New Mexico Youth Organized v. Herrera, No. 09-2212 (10th Cir. June 30, 2010).\n\nExpenditures for political purposes independently of a candidate.— An expenditure of funds for political purposes separately and independently of a candidate is not, by itself, an in-kind contribution to the candidate. If, however, the person gives the goods, services or other product of the expenditure to the candidate, the goods, services or other product will constitute an in-kind contribution. 2010 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 10-03.\n\nA political committee that makes contributions to candidates may solicit unlimited contributions from allowable persons on behalf of political committees that only make \"independent expenditures\".— The Campaign Reporting Act, §§ 1-19-25 to 1-19-36 NMSA 1978, limits the amounts persons may contribute to candidates, candidates' campaign committees, and political committees during primary and general election cycles, and further prohibits persons, including political committees, from knowingly soliciting or accepting contributions from other persons, including political committees, that exceed these limits, § 1-19-34.7(A)(1), (E), but § 1-19-34.7(I) provides that these limits and prohibitions do not apply to political committees that make \"independent expenditures\" only, and therefore a political committee that only makes independent expenditures may indirectly solicit unlimited contributions through a political committee that makes contributions to candidates, and further, a political committee that makes contributions to candidates may solicit unlimited contributions on behalf of a political committee that only makes independent expenditures. For similar reasons, an officeholder and a candidate may request third-party donors to contribute at any amount to a political committee that only makes independent expenditures. 2022 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2022-05.\n\nA candidate may not solicit unlimited contributions for a political committee that makes expenditures to support the candidate's election.— The Campaign Reporting Act's prohibitions on fundraising do not apply to political committees that only make \"independent expenditures\", but if a candidate solicits contributions to be given to a political committee, and the political committee uses contributions to pay for advertisements supporting the candidate's election, then the political committee is not making an \"independent expenditure\", but is making a \"coordinated expenditure\", which is prohibited by 1-19-34.7(E) NMSA 1978. 2022 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2022-05.\n\nEnergy company's payment of legislators' expenses incidental to an educational tour need not be reported as in-kind donations.— Payments from an energy company that is proposing to build a nuclear waste storage facility in southeastern New Mexico for members of the New Mexico legislature to attend a series of educational programs at the company's Missouri nuclear generating station are not required to be reported by legislators on their filings with the secretary of state, because the energy company's payment of reasonable expenses for flights, meals, refreshments, and lodging incidental to the educational tour are not given for a political purpose and therefore are not contributions under 1-19-26(H)(1) NMSA 1978. 2020 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2020-03.\n\nThe Campaign Reporting Act does not apply to federal elections.— Members of the New Mexico legislature and certain other elected officials are prohibited from knowingly soliciting contributions governed by the Campaign Reporting Act between January 1 and the adjournment of any regular legislative session and between the proclamation and adjournment of any special session, 1-19-34.1 NMSA 1978, but the Campaign Reporting Act only applies to candidates in primary, general or statewide special elections in New Mexico and excludes federal elections from the application of the act, and therefore a New Mexico state legislator who solicited campaign contributions for the federal office of United States Representative during a state legislative session did not violate the Campaign Reporting Act. 2021 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2021-05.\n\nFederal election law expressly preempts state election law with respect to election to federal office.— The Federal Election Campaign Act, 52 U.S.C. §§ 30101 et seq., expressly provides that it, and the rules prescribed under it, supersede and preempt any provision of state law with respect to election to federal office, and would therefore preempt any interpretation or application of New Mexico's Campaign Reporting Act (act), 1-19-25 to 1-19-36 NMSA 1978, that would prevent a state candidate from donating campaign funds to a candidate for federal office. As a result, the New Mexico secretary of state does not have the authority under the act to restrict donations from a state candidate's campaign funds to federal candidates.Campaign Reporting Act(9/2/21), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2021-11.\n\nThe Campaign Reporting Act (CRA) does not prohibit candidates for local elected office from using contributions received in local elections to support the candidate's subsequent campaign for an office covered by the CRA.— The Campaign Reporting Act (CRA) excludes municipal and special district offices from its definition of \"election\" thereby excepting candidates seeking municipal or special district elected office from the CRA's requirements concerning registration, disclosure, contributions, and expenditures, and the School District Campaign Reporting Act, §§ 1-22A-1 to 1-22A-10 NMSA 1978, permits the use of contributions for a candidate's election to any public office, including a public office subject to the CRA, and therefore a candidate for municipal, school district, or special district elected office is not prohibited by the CRA from using contributions to that candidacy to support the candidates subsequent campaign for an office covered by the CRA. Municipalities and special districts, however, may limit contributions or impose restrictions on the permissible use of those contributions by candidates for municipal or special district elected office. 2022 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2022-02.",

A political committee that has not received any contributions or made any coordinated or independent expenditures for a continuous period of at least one year may cancel its registration as a political committee by submitting an appropriate request in writing to the secretary of state. The committee shall retain the obligation to submit a new registration pursuant to Section 1-19-26.1 NMSA 1978 in the event that its future activities meet the requisites for registration under that section.\n\nH.

Whether an advertisement refers to a ballot question is immaterial to its classification as a coordinated or independent expenditure. For the coordinated expenditure, however, the political committee would be subject to contribution limits and disclosure requirements. 2022 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2022-08.",

It is unlawful for a candidate or the candidate's agent to make an expenditure of contributions received, except for the following purposes or as otherwise provided in this section:\n\n(1) expenditures of the campaign;\n\n(2) expenditures of legislators that are reasonably related to performing the duties of the office held, including mail, telephone and travel expenditures to serve constituents, but excluding personal and legislative session living expenses;\n\n(3) donations to the state general fund;\n\n(4) donations to an organization to which a federal income tax deduction would be permitted under Subparagraph (A) of Paragraph (1) of Subsection (b) of Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;\n\n(5) expenditures to eliminate the campaign debt of the candidate for the office sought or expenditures incurred by the candidate when seeking election to another public office covered by the Campaign Reporting Act;\n\n(6) donations to a political committee or to another candidate seeking election to public office; or\n\n(7) disbursements to return unused funds pro rata to the contributors if no campaign debt exists.\n\nB.

Gonzales, Memorandum Opinion and Order, Cv. No. 93-1135 JP (U.S. Dist. Ct. D. N.M. filed August 2, 1996).\n\nRipeness of challenge on first amendment grounds.— Although the congressman had not officially declared a candidacy for state office, this section's prohibition against using funds raised during a federal campaign for a statewide race created a direct and immediate dilemma for the congressman, and he should not have had to risk prosecution under this section before his challenge on first amendment grounds was ripe for judicial action.New Mexicans for Bill Richardson v. Gonzales, 64 F.3d 1495 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\nA candidate for an office covered by the Campaign Reporting Act is not prohibited from donating campaign funds to a candidate for a municipal, school board, or special district election.— Although the Campaign Reporting Act excludes from its definition of \"election\", any municipal, school board or special district election, 1-19-29.1(A)(6) NMSA 1978 permits donations to another candidate seeking election to \"public office,\" a position whose occupant has legal authority to exercise a government's sovereign powers for a fixed period, and municipal, school board, or special district offices meet this definition. Accordingly, 1-19-29.1(A)(6) NMSA 1978 permits donations of contributions received to candidates for public offices, including municipal, school board, and special district offices. 2021 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2021-11.\n\nThe Campaign Reporting Act does not prohibit a state campaign committee from making a donation to a municipal candidate.— Subsection 1-19-29.1(A)(6) NMSA 1978 of the Campaign Reporting Act permits the use of campaign contributions to make \"donations to a political committee or to another candidate seeking election to public office\"; the Campaign Reporting Act does not make a distinction between a federal, state or local candidate, and a plain reading of the law is that a donation to a candidate for any public office, federal, state or local, is permissible. It is permissible, therefore, under the New Mexico Campaign Reporting Act, for a state campaign committee to make a donation to a municipal candidate or local committee advocating for a municipal candidate.Restrictions of Campaign Committee Contributions to a Municipal Measure Finance Committee(6/17/20), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2020-06.\n\nA candidate for judicial office is prohibited from using contributions in a subsequent campaign for other public office.— Under the Campaign Reporting Act (CRA), a candidate for judicial office may solicit and accept campaign funds but must return unused funds in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct, and likewise, 21-404(B) NMRA of the Code of Judicial Conduct permits candidates for elective judicial office to accept contributions to support a campaign for judicial office, but prohibits the retention of contributions received after the election takes place, and therefore the CRA, which incorporates the Code of Judicial Conduct by reference, prohibits a municipal judge who intends to run for county office in 2022 from transferring unexpended contributions received as a candidate for judicial office to a newly-formed campaign committee that supports his candidacy for county office. Moreover, 21-405 NMRA of the Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits a judge seeking appointment or election to a public, nonjudicial office from soliciting or accepting funds, either personally or through a committee, to support the candidacy. 2022 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2022-02.\n\nA candidate may contract with a family member for bona fide goods or services to the candidate's campaign.— The Campaign Reporting Act, NMSA 1978, §§ 1-19-25 to -37, provides that a candidate may make an expenditure of campaign contributions for campaign expenses, and regulations promulgated by the secretary of state implementing the Campaign Reporting Act prohibit personal use of campaign funds, including payments to a candidate's family, but the regulations except from this prohibition situations where the family member is providing a bona fide service to the campaign and further specifies that any salary in excess of the fair market value of the services provided is personal use, and therefore a candidate may make payments to a member of the candidate's family so long as the family member provides bona fide goods or services to the campaign and is not being paid in excess of the fair market value for those goods or services. 2023 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2023-09.\n\nA candidate must report the expenditure of personal funds for campaign expenditures, and may be reimbursed for those expenditures if they are a loan to the campaign.— Regulations promulgated by the secretary of state implementing the Campaign Reporting Act require candidates to report the use of personal funds for campaign expenditures. If a candidate expends personal funds on goods or services for the candidate's campaign, the expenditure must be reported either as a contribution or as a loan; if the expenditure is a loan, the candidate may be reimbursed for the expenditure so long as the campaign committee properly itemizes and reports the expenditures. 2023 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2023-09.\n\nExpenditures for conferences and courses reasonably related to performing the duties of legislative office are permissible.— The Campaign Reporting Act, NMSA 1978, §§ 1-19-25(A)(2), provides that permissible uses of campaign funds includes expenditures of legislators that are reasonably related to performing the duties of the office held to serve constituents, and therefore a legislator may use campaign funds to pay for registration and associated travel to conferences and courses reasonably related to the elected legislative office. \"Reasonably related\" requires some degree of meaningful connection between the training and the legislative office held, and the use of campaign funds cannot be used for personal uses, which includes the use of campaign funds for personal travel, or travel associated with a training that is so broad or generalized it is not directly connected to the position of the legislative office held. 2024 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2024-02.\n\nFederal election law expressly preempts state election law with respect to election to federal office.— The Federal Election Campaign Act, 52 U.S.C. §§ 30101et seq., expressly provides that it, and the rules prescribed under it, supersede and preempt any provision of state law with respect to election to federal office, and would therefore preempt any interpretation or application of New Mexico's Campaign Reporting Act (act), 1-19-25 to 1-19-36 NMSA 1978, that would prevent a state candidate from donating campaign funds to a candidate for federal office. As a result, the New Mexico secretary of state does not have the authority under the act to restrict donations from a state candidate's campaign funds to federal candidates.Campaign Reporting Act(9/2/21), Att'y Gen.

At any time, the secretary of state may refer a matter to the state ethics commission for a civil injunctive or other appropriate order or to the attorney general or a district attorney for criminal enforcement.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 1-19-34.4, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 46, § 15; 1995, ch. 153, § 15; 1997, ch. 112, § 4; 2021, ch. 109, § 3.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective July 1, 2021, revised administrative and enforcement duties of the state ethics commission and the secretary of state under the Campaign Reporting Act, modified the complaint procedure under the Campaign Reporting Act, removed provisions related to binding arbitration following a notice of final action, and removed provisions allowing the secretary of state to refer violations of the Campaign Reporting Act to the attorney general or a district attorney for enforcement; in the section heading, after \"investigations\", deleted \"binding arbitration\"; in Subsection A, after \"statements of\", deleted \"exception\" and added \"no activity\", after the next occurrence of \"The\", deleted \"secretary of state, in consultation with the attorney general\" and added \"state ethics commission, in consultation with the secretary of state\", and after \"concerning the act\", deleted \"All prescribed forms prepared shall be clear and easy to complete.\"; in Subsection B, after \"The secretary of state may\", added \"conduct examinations of reports filed pursuant to Section 1-19-29 NMSA 1978 and the state ethics commission may\", and after \"has been violated\", deleted the remainder of the subsection; added a new Subsection C and redesignated former Subsection C as Subsection D; in Subsection D, after \"The secretary of state\", added \"and the state ethics commission\", after \"Campaign Reporting Act.\", deleted the remainder of the subsection; deleted former Subsections D through F and redesignated former Subsection G as Subsection E; and in Subsection E, after \"may refer a matter to the\", deleted \"attorney general or a district attorney\" and added \"state ethics commission\", and after \"appropriate order or\", added \"to the attorney general or a district attorney\".\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective June 20, 1997, in Subsection A, substituted \"that\" for \"the Campaign Reporting\"; made minor stylistic changes in Subsection B; and rewrote Subsections D, E and F.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, inserted \"statements of exception\" at the end of the second sentence in Subsection A, inserted \"any provision of\" preceding \"the Campaign Reporting Act\" and made a related change in Subsection B, rewrote Subsections C through E, and in Subsection F, added the first sentence and inserted \"and filed with the secretary of state\" following \"shall be issued\" in the fifth sentence.\n\nConstitutionality.— Provision of this section providing for binding arbitration of alleged violations of the Campaign Reporting Act, 1-19-25 through 1-19-36 NMSA 1978, for which a penalty has been imposed is not unconstitutional, because the act specifically requires that the arbitration procedures be governed by the Uniform Arbitration Act, 44-7-1 through 44-7-22 [44-7A-1 to 44-7A-32] NMSA 1978, which expressly authorizes judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. 2002 Op.

For purposes of this subsection, \"campaign committee\" includes a candidate committee regulated by the federal election commission.\n\nL. The members of a political party in a chamber of the legislature shall not maintain more than one legislative caucus committee in each chamber.\n\nHistory:Laws 2009, ch. 68, § 1; 2019, ch. 262, § 12.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2019, ch. 262, § 16 provided that the secretary of state, in consultation with the attorney general, shall promulgate rules to implement the amendatory provisions of this act by August 1, 2019.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective July 1, 2019, set a flat limit on contributions to all candidates and political committees of $5,000 per election cycle, provided that a primary election candidate who does not move on to the general election shall remain subject to the primary election cycle contribution limits and shall not accept a contribution from a person who has contributed the maximum allowable amount during the primary election cycle to pay for primary election expenditures, provided that a person, including a political committee, shall not make a contribution to a candidate committee authorized for the purpose of electing a candidate for governor in an amount that will cause that person's total contributions to the committee to exceed two times the limit imposed by the section during a primary or a general election cycle, prohibited contributions to a political party or legislative caucus committee that will cause the contributor's total contributions to the political party or legislative caucus committee to exceed five times the limit imposed by the section during a primary or a general election cycle, changed the date on which contribution limits are increased, provided that the limitation on contributions to candidates or campaign committees do not apply to the value of in-kind contributions from political parties or legislative caucus committees to candidates nominated by the parties in the general election, excluded contributions from candidates or campaign committees from the limitations on contributions to political parties or legislative caucus committees, and limited a political party caucus to one legislative caucus committee in each chamber of the legislature; deleted former Subsection A, added new Subsections A through C and redesignated former Subsections B through F as Subsections D through H, respectively; in Subsection F, after \"On\", deleted \"the day\" and added \"January 1\", and after \"shall take effect the\", deleted \"day after the\" and added \"January 1\"; and deleted former Subsection G and added Subsections I through L.\n\nSeverability.— Laws 2009, ch. 68, § 5 provided that if any part or application of this act is held invalid, the remainder or its application to other situations or persons shall not be affected.\n\nConstitutionality.— For a contribution limit to survive, a state must first show a sufficiently important interest in that limit, and that the challenged contribution limits are closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgement of associational freedoms.Republican Party of N.M. v. Torrez, ___ F.Supp.3d ___ (D. N.M. 2023).\n\nCampaign Reporting Act's limit on contributions from persons and political committees to state political parties is constitutional.— The state has established that it has a sufficiently important interest in limiting contributions to political parties to prevent circumvention of other valid contribution limits and actual or apparentquid pro quocorruption, and the Campaign Reporting Act's limits on contributions to parties are closely drawn to the state's interest in preventing circumvention and actual or apparentquid pro quocorruption.Republican Party of N.M. v. Torrez, ___ F.Supp.3d ___ (D. N.M. 2023).\n\nCampaign Reporting Act's limit on contributions from state to county political parties is unconstitutional.— The state has failed to put forth evidence that there is a serious risk of donors circumventing valid contribution limits by donating money to a state party with the intention that the money be donated to a county party so that the money can ultimately be donated to a candidate in exchange for aquid pro quoarrangement or the appearance of one. The limit on contributions from state to county parties, therefore, is too attenuated from the root concern ofquid pro quocorruption between individuals and candidates.Republican Party of N.M. v. Torrez, ___ F.Supp.3d ___ (D. N.M. 2023).\n\nCampaign Reporting Act's limit on contributions from state political parties to nongubernatorial candidates and gubernatorial candidates is unconstitutional.— The state has established that it has a sufficiently important interest in limiting contributions from state parties to candidates to prevent circumvention of other valid contribution limits, but the Campaign Reporting Act's limits on contributions by state parties to candidates are substantially lower than limits previously upheld by the United States supreme court and are substantially lower than comparable limits in other states, and the state has failed to show that it tailored its contribution limits to how much it costs to run a competitive statewide and local campaign, which demonstrates that the limits on contributions from state parties to candidates are not closely drawn to the state's interest in preventing circumvention of other valid contribution limits.Republican Party of N.M. v. Torrez, ___ F.Supp.3d ___ (D. N.M. 2023).\n\nA political committee that makes contributions to candidates may solicit unlimited contributions from allowable persons on behalf of political committees that only make \"independent expenditures\".— The Campaign Reporting Act, §§ 1-19-25 to 1-19-36 NMSA 1978, limits the amounts persons may contribute to candidates, candidates' campaign committees, and political committees during primary and general election cycles, and further prohibits persons, including political committees, from knowingly soliciting or accepting contributions from other persons, including political committees, that exceed these limits, § 1-19-34.7(A)(1), (E), but § 1-19-34.7(I) provides that these limits and prohibitions do not apply to political committees that make \"independent expenditures\" only, and therefore a political committee that only makes independent expenditures may indirectly solicit unlimited contributions through a political committee that makes contributions to candidates, and further, a political committee that makes contributions to candidates may solicit unlimited contributions on behalf of a political committee that only makes independent expenditures. For similar reasons, an officeholder and a candidate may request third-party donors to contribute at any amount to a political committee that only makes independent expenditures. 2022 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2022-05.\n\nA candidate may not solicit unlimited contributions for a political committee that makes expenditures to support the candidate's election.— The Campaign Reporting Act's prohibitions on fundraising do not apply to political committees that only make \"independent expenditures\", but if a candidate solicits contributions to be given to a political committee, and the political committee uses contributions to pay for advertisements supporting the candidate's election, then the political committee is not making an \"independent expenditure\", but is making a \"coordinated expenditure\", which is prohibited by 1-19-34.7(E) NMSA 1978. 2022 Op. Ethics Comm'n No. 2022-05.\n\nContributions by national committees of political parties.— The Campaign Reporting Act prohibits the national committee of a political party from contributing to its state political party in an amount greater than five thousand dollars ($5,000) during a primary election or during a general election. 2010 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 10-03.\n\nContributions by an individual and through a corporation owned by the individual.— The campaign Reporting Act does not prohibit an individual and a corporation controlled by the individual from making separate contributions in their own names up to the limits of the act. If, however, instead of separate contributions by the individual and the corporation, the individual makes a personal contribution and transfers funds to the corporation for purposes of making another contribution, the act would attribute both contributions to the individual for purposes of the act's contribution limits and if the contributions, in the aggregate exceed the contribution limits for either a primary or a general election, the contributions would be a violation of the act, even if the violation was not intentional. 2010 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 10-03.",
