Miera, 1923-NMSC-018, 28 N.M. 565, 215 P. 968.\n\nEffect of mere irregularities.— Elections conducted fairly and honestly will not be set aside for mere irregularity in the appointment of election officers or in conduct of the election where no fraud or illegal voting is shown.Carabajal v. Lucero, 1916-NMSC-045, 22 N.M. 30, 158 P. 1088.\n\nNo ballots received after 7:00 p.m. regardless of voter position.— From and after 7:00 p.m. no ballots shall be received by the officials, irrespective of whether voting machines or the ordinary type of balloting is employed. Thus it makes no difference that the person is in line outside the polling place and has not announced his name to the poll clerk, or that a person is inside the polling place and has not yet announced his name to the poll clerk or that he has announced his name to the poll clerk but has not yet gone into the voting machine to vote. At 7:00 p.m. the machine should be locked where voting machines are used, and where ordinary balloting is employed the officials must not allow the deposit of any ballots in the ballot boxes after this time. 1956 Op.

It is reasonably related to New Mexico's interests in protecting voters from intimidation at the polls and from preventing disruptions that might undermine the integrity of state elections. The statute is viewpoint neutral, and does not depend on the nature of or the reason for the disruption a particular citizen's presence at the polling place might cause.Ramos v. Carbajal, 508 F. Supp. 2d 905 (10th Cir. 2007).",

Unless the ballot box, election returns and materials are delivered to the county clerk within twenty-four hours after the polls are closed, the vote in the precinct shall not be canvassed or made a part of the final election results except upon order of the district court after finding that the delay in the delivery of materials was due to forces beyond the control of the precinct board [election board].\n\nB. In precincts not more than thirty-five miles distant from the county clerk's office, the delivery of the ballot box and election returns and materials shall be made by the presiding judge in person.\n\nC. In precincts more than thirty-five miles distant from the county clerk's office, the delivery of the ballot box, election returns and materials may be made by special messenger selected by the presiding judge and the election judges.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 3-12-56, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 240, § 292; 1987, ch. 249, § 38.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nLaws 2019, ch. 212, § 283, effective April 3, 2019, provided that references in the Election Code to \"precinct board\", shall be deemed to be references to \"election board\", as that term is defined in Section 1-1-13 NMSA 1978.\n\nCross references.— For messengers,see1-2-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nReturns recognized when delay beyond control.— Delayed returns are entitled to recognition when forces beyond control of election officials are responsible; such forces need not be acts of God or physical forces.Valdez v. Herrera, 1944-NMSC-013, 48 N.M. 45, 145 P.2d 864.\n\nReturns counted in absence of tampering.— Returns delayed beyond the statutory 24 hours due to faulty instructions were counted in absence of tampering with the ballots and pollbooks, the delay being considered beyond control of election officials.Valdez v. Herrera, 1944-NMSC-013, 48 N.M. 45, 145 P.2d 864.\n\nConstitutional mandate and principle controlling.— While former provision that election returns be filed with county clerk within 24 hours was probably mandatory, the constitutional mandate that person receiving highest number of votes be elected and the principle that voters must not be denied their rightful voice in government, unless public interest would not be served by preserving validity of election, were controlling.Valdez v. Herrera, 1944-NMSC-013, 48 N.M. 45, 145 P.2d 864.\n\nCourt will not view challenge in absence of fraud, etc.— In absence of any bad faith, fraud or reasonable opportunity for fraud, supreme court will view unsympathetically any challenge to right of a large number of persons to participate in an election.Valdez v. Herrera, 1944-NMSC-013, 48 N.M. 45, 145 P.2d 864.\n\nCourt could compel board to recanvass where returns incomplete.— When canvassing board proceeded to canvass votes without waiting for returns from one precinct which were unavoidably 25 hours late, court was authorized to compel board to reconvene, and recanvass the votes, and cancel certificates of election issued, without making holders of certificates parties.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Chavez, 1937-NMSC-022, 41 N.M. 300, 67 P.2d 1007.\n\nCustodians so remiss to create doubt.— If custodian of ballots has been so remiss in their preservation as to suggest probability of tampering or to create doubt as to their integrity, then none of the ballots, nor a recount thereof, may be relied on to overcome the official returns.Madrid v. Sandoval, 1932-NMSC-052, 36 N.M. 274, 13 P.2d 877.\n\nMere irregularity does not destroy election validity.— In absence of statute, mere irregularities in manner of conducting election, or making returns thereof, will not destroy validity of such election.Gallegos v. Miera, 1923-NMSC-018, 28 N.M. 565, 215 P. 968.\n\nStrict compliance not required for ballot preservation.— Departure from strict letter of statute as to preservation of ballots will not warrant their rejection, in absence of fraud or suspicion of fraud.Montoya v. Ortiz, 1918-NMSC-114, 24 N.M. 616, 175 P. 335).",
