      "text": "Every gardener, farmer, planter or other person having lands or crops that would be injured by trespassing animals, shall make a sufficient fence about his land in cultivation, or other lands that may be so injured, the same to correspond with the requirements of the laws of this state prescribing and defining a legal fence.\n\nHistory:Laws 1909, ch. 70, § 1; Code 1915, § 2340; C.S. 1929, § 50-101; 1941 Comp., § 49-1801; 1953 Comp., § 47-17-1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For fences along exterior of herd law districts,see77-12-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor fences within irrigation districts,see77-14-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor unlawful fences,see77-16-4, 77-16-6 and 77-16-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nOrdinance conflicted with free range of livestock management.— Where the county filed a criminal complaint against defendant for allowing defendant's cattle to run at large in violation of a county ordinance that made it unlawful for a person to allow or permit an animal to run at large; and the land in question was not within the boundary of a municipality, a conservancy district, or a military base, the metropolitan court properly dismissed the criminal complaint because the ordinance conflicted with New Mexico's free range or \"fence out\" approach to livestock management as expressed in Subsection C of Section 66-7-363 NMSA 1978 and Section 77-16-1 NMSA 1978, and the county did not have general authority to disallow the free running of livestock in unincorporated or open areas of their jurisdiction.Bernalillo Bd. of Co. Comm'rs v. Benavidez, 2013-NMCA-015, 292 P.3d 482, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-012.\n\nOwner's duty to enclose property.— Where the running of livestock is lawful, it is the duty of the owner of property to effectively enclose it should he desire to keep roaming stock off his premises.Stewart v. Oberholtzer, 1953-NMSC-042, 57 N.M. 253, 258 P.2d 369.\n\nLegal fence not necessary for landowner's recovery for damages.— Recovery of damages caused by trespassing animals and the award of injunctive relief is not barred by failure to have lands enclosed by a legal fence, where trespass complained of is proven to have been willfully committed.Frostenson v. Marshall, 1919-NMSC-010, 25 N.M. 215, 180 P. 287.\n\nRecovery for willful trespass may be had regardless of the existence of a statutory fence.Gallegos v. Allemand, 1945-NMSC-012, 49 N.M. 97, 157 P.2d 493.\n\nRelief as against willful trespass is not dependent upon the existence of the statutory fence.Wright v. Atkinson, 1935-NMSC-047, 39 N.M. 307, 46 P.2d 667;Carnes v. Withers, 1934-NMSC-059, 38 N.M. 441, 34 P.2d 1092;Vanderford v. Wagner, 1918-NMSC-099, 24 N.M. 467, 174 P. 426;Hill v. Winkler, 1915-NMSC-077, 21 N.M. 5, 151 P. 1014.\n\nLandowner's burden of proof.— Since landowner did not have a legal fence, before he may recover, it must be shown that the claimed trespasser drove his animals upon the lands of the injured party or willfully turned them loose upon other lands knowing that they would necessarily enter the lands of the injured party, and intended that they should do so.Woofter v. Lincoln, 1957-NMSC-031, 62 N.M. 297, 309 P.2d 622.\n\nA plaintiff, to recover damages from a defendant for willfully permitting cattle to trespass on his land, is required to prove that defendant turned cattle loose upon other's land, cognizant that the cattle would inevitably enter upon lands belonging to plaintiff and that such result was intended to follow.Gallegos v. Allemand, 1945-NMSC-012, 49 N.M. 97, 157 P.2d 493.\n\nNo recovery by landowner without willfulness or legal fence.— Where there was no \"willful trespass\" in action for damages to land by defendant's sheep, and lands were not shown to be in locality governed by the Herd Law (77-12-1 to 77-12-12 NMSA 1978), and where the lands of plaintiff and defendant were separated by a fence which was not a lawful fence as contemplated by 77-16-1 to 77-16-4 NMSA 1978, no damages were recoverable.Carnes v. Withers, 1934-NMSC-059, 38 N.M. 441, 34 P.2d 1092.\n\nOwner of unfenced lands cannot recover damages for the injury occasioned by trespassing animals thereon, where such animals are lawfully at large and the trespass is not willful.Carnes v. Withers, 1934-NMSC-059, 38 N.M. 441, 34 P.2d 1092;Vanderford v. Wagner, 1918-NMSC-099, 24 N.M. 467, 174 P. 426.\n\nNo right to retain trespassing animals.— No person has a lien or right to retain possession of any animals trespassing on his lands unless they are fenced by not less than four wires firmly fastened to posts.Candelaria v. Gutierrez, 1924-NMSC-070, 30 N.M. 195, 230 P. 436.\n\nEffect of this sectionis to deny a defendant the right to exercise force in expelling trespassing livestock from his premises, unless the trespass is willful.Stewart v. Oberholtzer, 1953-NMSC-042, 57 N.M. 253, 258 P.2d 369.\n\nLandowner may recover for damages.— Where animals have been turned out by their owners with the certainty that they will go upon the unfenced lands owned by another, the landowner can recover damages even though his land is not fenced. 1915 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 15-1561, 1915 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 15-1649, and 1916 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 16-1769.\n\nThis section does not repeal 77-14-3 NMSA 1978.1915 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 15-1567.\n\nAm.

Every railroad in this state whose lines of road, or any part thereof, are open for use and every railroad company formed or to be formed shall, within six months after the lines of the railroad or any part thereof are open, erect and thereafter maintain fences on the sides of the railroad or the part thereof so open for use, suitably and amply sufficient to prevent cattle, horses, sheep, mules, burros and hogs from getting on the railroad, except at the crossings of public roads and highways and within the limits of municipalities and shall also construct, where not already done, and maintain at all public road crossings now existing or hereafter established cattle guards suitable and sufficient to prevent cattle, horses, sheep, burros, mules and hogs from getting onto the railroad. If any railroad fails to construct and maintain fences and cattle guards as directed in this section, the railroad shall be liable to the owner for all damages resulting from injury or death caused to any livestock, including reasonable attorney fees, on order of the court should legal proceedings be commenced by the owner. Should the New Mexico livestock board be unable to determine ownership of livestock crippled or killed by the railroad within thirty days of the date it first receives notice of such injury or death, by report or otherwise, then the board may institute legal proceedings in the name of the unknown owner in any court of competent jurisdiction and recover damages as provided in this section, and the proceeds shall be disposed of as provided for under the laws pertaining to estrays.\n\nB. In the event that a fence is in a condition of neglect, disrepair or nonexistence, the adjacent landowner may contact the railroad supervisor or the owner of the right of way by certified mail, return receipt requested, and demand repair or construction to the legal standard provided in Section 77-16-17 NMSA 1978. Within thirty days thereafter, the railroad shall commence construction or provide proof of intent to comply, and after ten more days, if the railroad has failed to commence construction or to comply with agreed-upon terms of construction or repair, the adjacent landowner may repair, construct or cause to be repaired or constructed the fence at the expense of the railroad calculated at the cost of commercial rates common to the area. If the railroad fails to comply within thirty days of presentation of proof of cost, the landowner shall be compensated in an amount equal to two times the amount of the presented proof plus any cost of litigation, including attorney fees.\n\nC.
