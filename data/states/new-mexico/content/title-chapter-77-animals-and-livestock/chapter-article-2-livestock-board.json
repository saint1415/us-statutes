The livestock board, as the law enforcement agency for livestock inspectors, however, may set appropriate policies for the carrying of firearms, including policies dictating when livestock inspectors should or should not carry firearms while performing their responsibilities for enforcing the Livestock Code and criminal laws relating to livestock.Authority of Livestock Inspectors(11/13/18), Att'y Gen.

Att'y Gen. No. 68-46.\n\nBoard may adopt federal regulations.— Although the [New Mexico] livestock board is without power to enforce federal regulations respecting meat inspection, the board may adopt the federal regulations as a part of the rules and regulations of the board. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-46.\n\nBoard may not adopt some rules and regulations.— The [New Mexico] livestock board may not adopt rules and regulations involving: (1) control of ingredients of meat and meat products, unless such ingredients affect the wholesomeness of the meat; (2) labeling or misbranding of meat and meat products; (3) adulteration of meat and meat products, unless the adulteration affects the meat wholesomeness; (4) weights and measures for meat and meat products; (5) fraudulent advertising of meat and meat products or (6) deceptive fill of containers for meat and meat products. The above matters are within the purview of the powers granted to the state health department (now department of health). 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-46.\n\nLivestock inspector's law enforcement authority.— The law enforcement authority of a livestock inspector is limited to the power and authority expressly granted or necessarily implied in statute; certified livestock inspectors employed by the livestock board have the same powers as any other peace officer for enforcement of the Livestock Code and other criminal laws relating to livestock. Livestock inspectors, therefore, may not act as law enforcement officers or assist other law enforcement agencies to enforce criminal laws outside the inspector's specific statutory authority.Authority of Livestock Inspectors(11/13/18), Att'y Gen.

Ltr. 2018-08.\n\nLivestock inspectors are not statutorily required to carry a firearm while on duty.— This section provides that all livestock inspectors appointed by the board shall have the same powers as any other peace officer in the enforcement of that code, and 30-7-2(A)(3) NMSA 1978, permits certified law enforcement officers, including livestock inspectors to carry a firearm, but there is no statute that requires livestock inspectors to carry a firearm while on duty or otherwise. The livestock board, as the law enforcement agency for livestock inspectors, however, may set appropriate policies for the carrying of firearms, including policies dictating when livestock inspectors should or should not carry firearms while performing their responsibilities for enforcing the Livestock Code and criminal laws relating to livestock.Authority of Livestock Inspectors(11/13/18), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2018-08.\n\nBoard may not require approval of slaughterhouse construction.— The design and construction of slaughterhouses and meat establishments is not sufficiently related to protecting the public from unwholesome meat so as to allow the [New Mexico] livestock board to require approval of plans of construction of slaughterhouses and meat establishments without specific statutory power. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-115.\n\nAlthough some regulations reasonably related to power of board.— The health of slaughterhouse employees, the sanitation of slaughterhouses, meat establishments and transportation vehicles and the maintenance of slaughterhouses and meat establishments are all reasonably related to powers of the [New Mexico] livestock board. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-115.\n\nHealth department also to determine wholesomeness of meat.— The fact that the [New Mexico] livestock board may be inspecting meats to determine if they are unwholesome in no way limits the powers of the health department to independently determine whether the meat is unwholesome. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-115.",
