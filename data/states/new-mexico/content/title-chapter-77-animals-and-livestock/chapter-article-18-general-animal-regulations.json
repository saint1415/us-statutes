      "text": "A. If a livestock inspector or other peace officer has reason to believe that livestock are being cruelly treated, the inspector or peace officer may apply to a court in the county where the livestock are located for a warrant to seize the allegedly cruelly treated livestock.\n\nB. On a showing of probable cause to believe that the livestock are being cruelly treated, the court shall issue a warrant for the seizure of the livestock and set the matter for hearing as expeditiously as possible within thirty days unless good cause for a later time is demonstrated by the state. Seizure as authorized by this section shall be restricted to only those livestock allegedly being cruelly treated. The board by rule shall establish procedures for preserving evidence of alleged cruel treatment of livestock.\n\nC. If criminal charges are filed against the owner, the court shall, upon proper petition, proceed to determine if security is required to be posted pursuant to Section 30-18-1.2 NMSA 1978. Otherwise, the judge or magistrate executing the warrant shall notify the board, have the livestock impounded and give written notice to the owner of the livestock of the time and place of a hearing to determine disposition of the livestock. All interested parties, including the district attorney, shall be given an opportunity to present evidence at the hearing.\n\nD. For livestock that is not an equine:\n\n(1) if the court finds that the owner has cruelly treated the livestock, the court shall order the sale of the livestock at fair market value or order humane destruction; provided that if the livestock are ordered sold, the sale shall occur within ten days of the order; and further provided that if the court does not find that the owner has cruelly treated the livestock, the court shall order the livestock returned to the owner;\n\n(2) if the court orders the sale of the livestock, the board shall take proper action to ensure that the livestock are sold at fair market value, including acceptance of reasonable bids or sale at auction; provided that a bid by the owner of the livestock or the owner's representative shall not be accepted; and\n\n(3) proceeds from the sale of the livestock shall be forwarded to the court ordering the sale; provided that from these proceeds, the court shall pay all expenses incurred in caring for the livestock while they were impounded and any expenses involved in their sale; and further provided that any excess proceeds of the sale shall be forwarded to the former owner; and further provided that if the expenses incurred in caring for and selling the livestock exceed the amount received from the sale, the court shall order the former owner to pay the additional cost.\n\nE. For livestock that is an equine:\n\n(1) if the court finds that the owner has cruelly treated the equine, the court shall give a registered equine rescue or retirement facility the right of first refusal to purchase the equine for an ownership transfer fee equal to all actual costs incurred by the impounding agency in caring for the equine while the equine was impounded; provided that:\n\n(a) the board shall provide a bill of sale to the registered equine rescue or retirement facility that purchases the equine; and\n\n(b) the bill of sale shall be legal evidence of the ownership of the equine by the registered equine rescue or retirement facility and shall be legal title to the equine;\n\n(2) if the court finds that the owner has cruelly treated the equine and a registered equine rescue or retirement facility has been given the right of first refusal but the registered equine rescue or retirement facility is unable or unwilling to purchase the equine:\n\n(a) the board shall auction the equine through a sealed-bid process administered by the board and established by rule;\n\n(b) any proceeds from the sale less expenses incurred in caring for the equine while the equine was impounded shall be forwarded to the former owner;\n\n(c) if the expenses incurred in caring for the equine exceed the proceeds from the sale, the court shall order the former owner to pay the additional costs; and\n\n(d) if the equine is not purchased through the sealed-bid process, the board may pursue an alternative placement for care with a last resort option to humanely euthanize the equine by a licensed veterinarian; and\n\n(3) if the court does not find that the owner cruelly treated the equine, the court shall order the equine returned to the owner.\n\nHistory:Laws 1987, ch. 151, § 1; 1999, ch. 282, § 102; 2009, ch. 43, § 3; 2023, ch. 45, § 11.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective July 1, 2023, revised procedures for seizure and disposition of equine that have been cruelly treated; in Subsection C, added \"All interested parties, including the district attorney, shall be given an opportunity to present evidence at the hearing.\"; in Subsection D, deleted \"All interested parties, including the district attorney, shall be given an opportunity to present evidence at the hearing, and\" and added \"For livestock that is not an equine\", and redesignated former Subsections E and F as Paragraphs D(2) and D(3), respectively; and added a new Subsection E.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective June 19, 2009, in Subsection A, changed \"magistrate court\" to \"court\"; in Subsection C, added the first sentence; in Subsection D, added \"including the district attorney\"; and in Subsections E and F, changed \"magistrate court\" to \"court\".\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, deleted \"by depriving them of necessary sustenance\" following 'cruelly treated\" in Subsections A and B, and made a similar deletion in Subsection D; in Subsection A, inserted \"or other peace officer\" near the beginning and\"allegedly\" near the end; in Subsection B, substituted \"the matter for hearing as expeditiously as possible within thirty days unless good cause for a later time is demonstrated by the state\" for \"a time within ten days of the seizure for a hearing to determine whether the livestock are being so cruelly treated\" in the first sentence, and added the last sentence; added the Subsection C and D designations, redesignating the subsequent subsections accordingly; in Subsection D, substituted \"the sale of the livestock at fair market value or order humane destruction. If the livestock is ordered sold, the sale shall occur within ten days of the order\" for \"a public sale of the livestock to be held at the next scheduled sale or within ten days, and the court shall have the livestock delivered to a licensed sales ring for public auction\"; in the first sentence of Subsection E, inserted \"magistrate\", and substituted \"the board shall take proper action to ensure the livestock is sold at fair market value, including acceptance of reasonable bids or sale at auction\" for \"by auction, notice of the auction shall be posted on a public bulletin board where other public notices are posted for the city, town or county\"; in Subsection F, substituted \"former owner\" for \"owner convicted of so cruelly treating the livestock\" in the second sentence, and added the last sentence; deleted former Subsection E, which defined \"livestock\"; and made stylistic changes throughout the section.",

      "text": "A. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"public land\" does not include federal land controlled by the bureau of land management, the forest service or state trust land controlled by the state land office;\n\n(2) \"range\" means the amount of land necessary to sustain a herd of wild horses, which does not exceed its known territorial limits;\n\n(3) \"Spanish colonial horse\" means a wild horse that is descended from horses of the Spanish colonial period; and\n\n(4) \"wild horse\" means an unclaimed horse on public land that is not an estray.\n\nB. A wild horse that is captured on public land shall have its conformation, history and deoxyribonucleic acid tested to determine if it is a Spanish colonial horse. If it is a Spanish colonial horse, the wild horse shall be relocated to a state or private wild horse preserve created and maintained for the purpose of protecting Spanish colonial horses. If it is not a Spanish colonial horse, it shall be returned to the public land, relocated to a public or private wild horse preserve or put up for adoption by the agency on whose land the wild horse was captured.\n\nC. If the mammal division of the museum of southwestern biology at the university of New Mexico determines that a wild horse herd exceeds the number of horses that is necessary for preserving the genetic stock of the herd and for preserving and maintaining the range, it may cause control of the wild horse population through the use of birth control and may cause excess horses to be:\n\n(1) humanely captured and relocated to other public land or to a public or private wild horse preserve;\n\n(2) adopted by a qualified person for private maintenance; or\n\n(3) euthanized; provided that this option applies only to wild horses that are determined by a veterinarian to be crippled or otherwise unhealthy.\n\nHistory:Laws 2007, ch. 216, § 1.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2007, ch. 216 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 23, was effective June 15, 2007, 90 days after the adjournment of the legislature.\n\nDuty of the livestock board to test and relocate horses pursuant to this section.— The legislature intended to require the livestock board to test and relocate wild horses captured on public land as provided in 77-18-5(B) NMSA 1978.Wild Horse Observers Ass'n, Inc. v. N.M. Livestock Bd., 2016-NMCA-001, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-010.\n\nWhere the wild horse observers association (association) filed a complaint for declaratory relief, claiming that the New Mexico livestock board unlawfully treated a group of undomesticated, unowned, free-roaming horses in Placitas, New Mexico as \"livestock\" and \"estray\" rather than as wild horses under the Livestock Code, 77-2-1 to 77-18-6 NMSA 1978, the district court's dismissal for failure to state a claim was improper where the association averred that the Placitas horses are not domesticated, that they are not owned and never have been owned, that the horses are unbranded, unclaimed, and free-roaming, that the livestock board has captured and auctioned at least twenty-five horses and that the auctioned horses were taken from public land, and that the horses have not been tested to confirm whether they are Spanish colonial horses, as required by 77-18-5(B) NMSA 1978. These facts, taken as true, adequately state a claim that the Placitas horses fit the criteria of \"wild horses\" under 77-18-5 NMSA 1978, and that the livestock board unlawfully failed to test and relocate the wild horses it captured.Wild Horse Observers Ass'n, Inc. v. N.M. Livestock Bd., 2016-NMCA-001, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-010.\n\nWild horses captured on private land.— Where the New Mexico livestock board (board) sought to classify certain horses corralled by a private citizen onto private property as estray livestock, rather than as wild horses, and where plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory relief and emergency injunctive relief, asserting that the board exceeded its authority and unlawfully treated the subject horses as estray livestock, a petition for declaratory relief seeking an order declaring the subject horses to be wild horses, and a temporary restraining order preventing the board from impounding or selling the subject horses, and where the district court found that the board failed to comply with its statutory duties under § 77-18-5(B) NMSA 1978, the district court did not err in concluding that the subject horses were wild horses, because the subject horses were not and were never domesticated, and wild horses whose habitat includes public lands do not lose their wild status when captured on private lands, but the district court erred in concluding that when the board wrongfully took possession of the subject horses on private land, the board should have exercised its duties under this section; the board's duty to test the conformation, history, and DNA of a wild horse is only applicable where a wild horse is captured on public land. The board's duty was to return the subject horses to the public land they inhabit.Wild Horse Observers Ass'n v. N.M. Livestock Bd., 2022-NMCA-061.",
