      "text": "\"Local public body\" means every political subdivision of the state that expends public money from whatever source derived, including counties, county institutions, boards, bureaus or commissions; incorporated cities, towns or villages; drainage, conservancy, irrigation or other districts; charitable institutions for which an appropriation is made by the legislature; and every office or officer of any of the above. \"Local public body\" does not include a mutual domestic water consumers association, a land grant, an incorporated municipality or a special district with an annual revenue, exclusive of capital outlay funds, federal or private grants or capital outlay funds disbursed directly by an administrating agency, of less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), nor county, municipal, consolidated, union or rural school districts and their officers or irrigation districts organized under Sections 73-10-1 through 73-10-47 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 11-2-56, enacted by Laws 1957, ch. 250, § 1; 1961, ch. 207, § 1; 2009, ch. 283, § 1; 2017, ch. 146, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Senate Bill 222, enacted by the Fifty-Third Legislature, First Session, 2017, was vetoed by the governor on March 15, 2017. Pursuant to the First Judicial District Court's decision in State ex rel. New Mexico Legislative Council v. Honorable Susana Martinez, Governor of the State of New Mexico et al., D-101-CV-2017-01550, and affirmed by S.Ct. Order No. S-1-SC-36731, on April 25, 2018, which held that Article IV, Section 22 of the New Mexico Constitution requires that objections must accompany a returned bill, Senate Bill 222 was chaptered into law by the Secretary of State.\n\nThe 2017 amendment,effective July 1, 2017, raised the threshold for being exempt from the definition of \"local public body\"; in the first sentence, after \"including\", deleted \"but not limited to\"; and in the second sentence, after \"of less\", changed \"then\" to \"than\", and deleted \"ten thousand dollars ($10,000)\" and added \"fifty thousand dollars ($50,000)\".\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2010, in the second sentence, between \"does not include\" and \"county, municipal\", added new language and changed the statutory reference from Sections 75-23-1 through 75-23-45 NMSA 1978 to Sections 73-10-1 through 73-10-47 NMSA 1978.\n\nDFA control over expenditures.— The articles on financial control (Section 6-5-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.) and local government finances (Section 6-6-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.) make it clear that the legislature intended the department of finance and administration to have significant control over the expenditure of public monies.Joseph E. Montoya & Assocs. v. State, 1985-NMSC-074, 103 N.M. 224, 704 P.2d 1100.\n\nValidity of 6-6-1 to 6-6-6 NMSA 1978.— Sections 6-6-1 to 6-6-6 NMSA 1978 constitute an independent statute, the meaning of which is reasonably clear from an examination of the statute itself, and it does not constitute \"blind legislation\" prohibited by the constitution. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-85.\n\nThe middle Rio Grande conservancy district is a \"local public body\"as defined by this section. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-209.",

      "text": "The local government division of the department of finance and administration has the power and duty in relation to local public bodies to:\n\nA. require each local public body to furnish and file with the division, on or before June 1 of each year, a proposed budget for the next fiscal year;\n\nB. examine each proposed budget and, on or before July 1 of each year, approve and certify to each local public body an operating budget for use pending approval of a final budget;\n\nC. hold public hearings on proposed budgets;\n\nD. make corrections, revisions and amendments to the proposed budgets as may be necessary to meet the requirements of law;\n\nE. certify a final budget for each local public body to the appropriate governing body prior to the first Monday in September of each year. The budgets, when approved, are binding upon all tax officials of the state;\n\nF. require periodic financial reports, at least quarterly, of local public bodies.

In case of a need necessitating the expenditure for an item not provided for in the budget, upon approval of the secretary of finance and administration, the budget may be revised to authorize the expenditures;\n\nI. with written approval of the secretary of finance and administration, increase the total budget of any local public body in the event the local public body undertakes an activity, service, project or construction program that was not contemplated at the time the final budget was adopted and approved and which activity, service, project or construction program will produce sufficient revenue to cover the increase in the budget or the local public body has surplus funds on hand not necessary to meet the expenditures provided for in the budget with which to cover the increase in the budget; provided, however, that the attorney general shall review legal questions identified by the secretary arising in connection with such budget increase requests;\n\nJ. supervise the disbursement of funds to the end that expenditures will not be made in excess of budgeted items or for items not budgeted and that there will not be illegal expenditures;\n\nK. prescribe the form for all budgets, books, records and accounts for local public bodies; and\n\nL. with the approval of the secretary of finance and administration, make rules relating to budgets, records, reports, handling and disbursement of public funds or in any manner relating to the financial affairs of the local public bodies.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 11-2-57, enacted by Laws 1957, ch. 250, § 2; 1976 (S.S.), ch. 28, § 1; 1977, ch. 247, § 112; 1987, ch. 261, § 1; 2003, ch. 273, § 11; 2011, ch. 106, § 2.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2023, ch. 2, § 1, effective February 20, 2023, provided that:\n\nA. The local government division of the department of finance and administration, in consultation with the homeland security and emergency management department, shall provide zero-interest reimbursable loans to political subdivisions of the state that have been approved for federal public assistance funding for projects to replace or repair public infrastructure damaged by fire, flooding or debris flows caused by or stemming from the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon fire. The local government division shall require a contract for reimbursement from a political subdivision of the state receiving a loan pursuant to this section. The contract shall specify:\n\n(1) that the political subdivision shall pay the loan using first dollars received from the approved federal public assistance funding that serves as the basis for the loan;\n\n(2) the political subdivision shall repay the loan within thirty days of having received the approved federal public assistance funding;\n\n(3) such notice or reporting requirements that the local government division deems necessary to be sufficiently informed regarding compliance with Paragraphs (1) and (2) this subsection; and\n\n(4) that upon failure to meet a requirement of this subsection, the loan shall be repaid at current market interest rates.\n\nB. All loan repayments made pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the general fund.\n\nC. The secretary of finance and administration shall take any and all legal actions necessary to enforce the terms of contracts entered into pursuant to this section.\n\nD. On or before April 1, 2023, and every three months thereafter, the local government division shall provide a report to the legislative finance committee and the governor regarding the loans made pursuant to this section, including: the projects for which loan contracts have been made, the dollar amounts of those contracts, the repayments made pursuant to contracts, any breaches of contract and subsequent enforcement actions pursuant to this section. Reports pursuant to this subsection shall cease upon the final repayment on a contract pursuant to this section.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2019, ch. 231, § 1, effective June14, 2019, provided:\n\nA. The local government division of the department of finance and administration shall:\n\n(1) conduct an analysis and feasibility study of the siting, planning, design and construction of a library and multi-use complex to provide for the health and well-being of the residents of Chaparral; and\n\n(2) recommend an implementation schedule for the siting, planning, design and construction of such facility.\n\nB. The feasibility study shall assess:\n\n(1) the needs of the community that can be met by the construction of a library and multi-use complex, including:\n\n(a) library resources, including reading material, audiobooks and access to computer and internet services and multimedia technology;\n\n(b) temporary facilities for public agencies to provide services and support to local residents;\n\n(c) office and meeting spaces for nonprofit organizations to offer health and well-being services, including physical health and dental services, domestic violence and sexual assault counseling, legal aid clinics, taxpayer assistance, financial literacy classes, fitness and nutritional support, entrepreneurial and small business advising and resume and job skills training; and\n\n(d) public space for town halls and other community meetings;\n\n(2) whether the library and multi-use complex should be constructed separately or as a single facility; and\n\n(3) options for siting of the facility or facilities, including a cost-benefit analysis of each option. The cost-benefit analysis shall consider:\n\n(a) convenience for the residents of Chaparral;\n\n(b) safe and secure access and visibility;\n\n(c) opportunities to leverage public or private property and resources for cost saving; and\n\n(d) availability of appropriate property and any legal or physical siting constraints.\n\nC. In conducting the feasibility study, the division shall consider input from residents of Chaparral and elected officials representing the community at the local, state and federal levels.\n\nD. The implementation schedule shall recommend time line and budget phases for all aspects of the project, including siting, planning, design and construction.\n\nE. The study is contingent on funding received through legislative appropriation.\n\nThe 2011 amendment,effective July 1, 2012, required the local government division to notify the secretary of finance and administration if a municipality or a county failed to submit two consecutive financial reports.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, in Subsection F, inserted \"at least quarterly\" following \"financial reports\", deleted \"but not limited to\" following \"grants-in-aid received, including\"; inserted \"exists\" following \"and a need\" in Subsection G; and deleted \"and regulations\" following \"rules\" in Subsection K.\n\nCity may spend revenues where approval should have been granted.— Where a city properly meets the standards set out in Subsection H of this section and approval by the attorney general and the department of finance and administration should be granted, the city will not be precluded from using the revenues in question.Apodaca v. Wilson, 1974-NMSC-071, 86 N.M. 516, 525 P.2d 876 (decided under prior law).\n\nCity bound by budget resolution requesting approval.— Where a home-rule city passes a budget resolution which, by its very terms, requests approval of the attorney general and the department of finance and administration under Subsection H of this section, the city is bound by its own resolution in requesting such approval, and cannot later contend that it may act without regard to state approval.Apodaca v. Wilson, 1974-NMSC-071, 86 N.M. 516, 525 P.2d 876 (decided prior to 1987 amendment).\n\nLocal government division may suspend public hearing on proposed budgetat any time for good cause. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-77.\n\nProrating of funds when insufficient funds available for payment of salaries.— Where funds are not available for the payment of salaries, the Bateman Act (Sections 6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) requires that available funds be distributed pro rata to the elected county officials so long as they last. The local government division cannot use the guise of forcing a large line item figure in a budget to justify cutting of salaries. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-77.\n\nBudget line transfer authorized where clerical error results in budget line deficit.— Where a clerical error results in a budget line deficit, an authorized budget line transfer may be accomplished by the director (secretary) of the department of finance and administration with or without request of the local authorities. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-09.\n\nDivision has authority to correct, revise and amend local budgets.— The local government division of the department of finance and administration has the authority under this section to correct, revise and amend the budget of a subdivision of a state and to certify a final budget prior to the first Monday in September of each year. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-09.\n\nLocal agency may not maintain separate account where county treasurer is agency's disbursing agent.— Where the county treasurer is the disbursing agent for normal transactions handled by a local county civil defense agency, the latter may not maintain a separate checking account for public funds of such agency. 1965 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-51.\n\nBoard of county commissioners, acting as a board of finance, may not delegate to a financial advisor duties that are statutorily delegated to either the county treasurer or the board.— Where the Sandoval county board of county commissioners hired a contractor to formulate an investment policy for the county and to advise the Sandoval county treasurer and the board of financial matters, the contractor may aid the county commissioners, acting as the board of finance, in the formulation of an investment policy, but the contractor may not be delegated the statutory authority to supervise, demand or oversee the roles and responsibilities of the county treasurer. New Mexico courts have confirmed that a board of county commissioners may delegate its \"advice and consent\" authority to the county treasurer through the adoption of a county investment policy; yet, it may not delegate its statutory \"advice and consent\" authority to a contractor.Sandoval County Treasurer(5/17/16), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2016-04.\n\nDivision may not substitute its judgment for that of local officials.— Subsection D of this section, giving the local government division the power to make corrections, revisions and amendments to proposed budgets, does not give that division a bludgeon to be held over the governing board of a local body to force them to exercise their discretion in accordance with the views of the officials in control of the department of finance and administration. The amount of money deemed necessary to repair a court house should be left to the exercise of sound discretion by the board of county commissioners. A line item within a budget for repair of the court house is not such an expenditure as is necessary to meet the requirements of law within the meaning of Subsection D of this section, insofar as fixing the amount necessary is concerned. The local government division cannot arbitrarily force the board of county commissioners to establish a line item in a budget at a sum which, in the judgment of the board of county commissioners, is excessive to meet the needs of that item. As a consequence thereto, the local government division does not have the power to order suspension of all disbursements by a county merely because the county has not provided a sum of money for a line item which the local government division feels is necessary. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-77.",

Any officer of any county, municipality, school district or local school board, who shall issue any certificate or other form of approval of indebtedness separate from the account filed in the first place or who shall at any time use the fund belonging to any current year for any other purpose than paying the current expenses of that year, or who shall violate any of the provisions of this section, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nHistory:Laws 1897, ch. 42, § 15; C.L. 1897, § 299; Code 1915, § 1227; C.S. 1929, § 33-4241; 1941 Comp., § 7-607; 1953 Comp., § 11-6-6; Laws 1968, ch. 72, § 7.\n\nCross references.— For budgets of local public bodies,see6-6-2 to 6-6-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The Bateman Act, which provided for funding the floating indebtedness of counties, boards of education, municipal corporations and school districts, was enacted by Laws 1897, ch. 42. Only the presently operative portions thereof, §§ 15 to 21 (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978), were retained in the 1915 Code and subsequent compilations.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nBateman Act not repealed by later enactments.— The Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) was not repealed by § 1339, 1915 Code (since repealed) relating to tax levies for judgments for current expenses.James v. Board of Comm'rs, 1918-NMSC-106, 24 N.M. 509, 174 P. 1001.\n\nThe Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) was not repealed by Laws 1915, ch. 12 (since repealed) which fixed salaries for county officers.James v. Board of Comm'rs, 1918-NMSC-106, 24 N.M. 509, 174 P. 1001.\n\nThe Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978), limiting county expenses to current funds, was not repealed by a statute permitting levy of taxes for judgments for current expenses.Optic Publ'g Co. v. Board of Comm'rs, 1921-NMSC-088, 27 N.M. 371, 202 P. 124.\n\nThe Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) was not repealed by Acts 1919, ch. 16 (since repealed), providing for the payment of salaries of county officers.Baca v. Board of Comm'rs, 1924-NMSC-073, 30 N.M. 163, 231 P. 637.\n\nPurpose.— The purpose of the Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) is to prevent counties and municipalities from contracting debts they are not able to pay.Treloar v. County of Chaves, 2001-NMSC-074, 130 N.M. 794, 32 P.3d 803, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 64, 33 P.3d 284 (2001).\n\nIntent of Bateman Act.— The Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) was designed to require municipalities to live within their annual incomes.City of Hobbs v. State ex rel. Reynolds, 1970-NMSC-133, 82 N.M. 102, 476 P.2d 500.\n\nPolicy adopted by legislature.— The legislature adopted as a policy the plan that counties and other municipal subdivisions should be compelled to limit their expenses to their respective incomes, and that their debts insofar as they exceeded such income should be void, except for the purposes of entitling the creditor to his pro rata of moneys coming in from deferred taxes.Johnston v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1904-NMSC-018, 12 N.M. 237, 78 P. 43.\n\nThis statute does not exempt villages.Campbell v. Village of Green Tree, 1955-NMSC-030, 59 N.M. 255, 282 P.2d 1101.\n\nII. APPLICABILITY.\n\nBateman Act applicable to debts for necessities.— The Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) applies to debts created for necessities such as water and lights for use at a courthouse or others which may be arbitrarily placed against a county, as well as those of voluntary creation.Santa Fe Water & Light Co. v. Santa Fe Cnty., 1924-NMSC-028, 29 N.M. 538, 224 P. 402.\n\nCounty indebtedness for publication of delinquent tax list.— Indebtedness incurred by county for publication of delinquent tax list is within the provisions and limitations of the Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978).Sena v. Board of Comm'rs, 1921-NMSC-094, 27 N.M. 461, 202 P. 984.\n\nInapplicable to indebtedness to state.— The Bateman Act (Sections 6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) does not apply to indebtedness to the state.State ex rel. Wilson v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1957-NMSC-005, 62 N.M. 137, 306 P.2d 259;State v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1928-NMSC-026, 33 N.M. 340, 267 P. 72.\n\nContracts for services of attorney.— The Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) does not apply to contracts for services of an attorney. An attorney rendering services is entitled to payment from taxes collected that year, but not used, and in the next tax levy, if necessary.Neal v. Board of Educ., 1935-NMSC-093, 40 N.M. 13, 52 P.2d 614.\n\nBateman Act not applicable to special funds.— The Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) has no application to special funds created for special purposes.San Juan Water Comm'n v. Taxpayers & Water Users of San Juan Cnty., 1993-NMSC-050, 116 N.M. 106, 860 P.2d 748.\n\nSpecial funds for special services.— If a special fund for a special purpose is created, the Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) is not applicable.City of Hobbs v. State ex rel. Reynolds, 1970-NMSC-133, 82 N.M. 102, 476 P.2d 500.\n\nIII. EXPENDITURES AND INDEBTEDNESS.\n\nSpecial fund available to pay contract.— The Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978)was not applicable to defeat a physician's claim for monies due following the termination of his employment with a county hospital since the county's setting aside several million dollars for contingencies from the sale of the hospital created a special fund from which the claim could be paid.Treloar v. County of Chaves, 2001-NMCA-074, 130 N.M. 794, 32 P.3d 803, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 64, 33 P.3d 284.\n\nJoint powers agreement to fund water acquisition.— A joint powers agreement entered in to with the U.S. bureau of reclamation pursuant to the Joint Powers Agreement Act was intended to create a specific general fund funded by a specific mill levy to pay for the acquisition of water rights and thus did not violate the Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978).San Juan Water Comm'n v. Taxpayers & Water Users of San Juan Cnty., 1993-NMSC-050, 116 N.M. 106, 860 P.2d 748.\n\nTerminated physician's claim against county hospital.— The Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) did not defeat a physician's claim for monies allegedly due following the involuntary termination of his employment with a county hospital since there was no indication that, if the hospital had continued as a county hospital, it would not have been able to pay the severance payments out of the funds it collected in the year the physician's services were terminated.Treloar v. County of Chaves, 2001-NMCA-074,130 N.M. 794, 32 P.3d 803, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 64, 33 P.3d 284.\n\nBateman Act does not excuse payment of debts which could have been paid.— The Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) makes void debts which are not and cannot be paid, but where the debt was not paid, although it could have been paid, the statute is not applicable.Cathey v. City of Hobbs, 1973-NMSC-042, 85 N.M. 1, 508 P.2d 1298.\n\nPayments for water supply financed by water charges sufficient to meet payments not general obligations.— Where a municipality enacts an ordinance to obtain, supplement and pay for its water supply and to adopt and enforce water charges sufficient to meet the required payments, such payments are not general obligations or indebtednesses within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provisions.City of Hobbs v. State ex rel. Reynolds, 1970-NMSC-133, 82 N.M. 102, 476 P.2d 500.\n\nMaterials for school district are direct charge item for which only that district is liable.— Obligation to pay for roofing material sold to county board of education as agent for a particular school district is a direct charge item for which only the district for which it is allocated is liable, and even then is recoverable only in the event that current revenues sufficient in amount to pay the bill are collected.McAtee v. Gutierrez, 1944-NMSC-001, 48 N.M. 100, 146 P.2d 315.\n\nLimitation on funds from which judgments may be paid.— A judgment rendered in one year for fees, salaries or perquisites of an officer for a preceding year cannot be paid out of any funds except the taxes collected for the current year in which the services are rendered or the fees and perquisites become due.Territory ex rel. Adair v. Beall, 1904-NMSC-007, 12 N.M. 131, 75 P. 38.\n\nIrregular issuance of certificates of indebtedness.— An irregular issue of certificates of indebtedness far exceeding anticipated proceeds of tax levy for the year does not show conscious wrongdoing preventing certificate holders from proceeding against the buildings for the erection of which the certificates were issued.Shaw v. Board of Educ., 1934-NMSC-031, 38 N.M. 298, 31 P.2d 993.\n\nCity indebtedness for swimming pool construction over two-year period.— Indebtedness incurred for swimming pool construction over two-year period is void by reason of the provisions of this section.McMurtry v. City of Raton, 1959-NMSC-096, 66 N.M. 277, 347 P.2d 168.\n\nCity employees may not recover back wages under invalid minimum wage ordinance.— A city has no authority to delegate to the state labor commissioner power to establish minimum wages for city employees, and city employees may not recover wages for past years that would have been payable under such an invalid standard.Adams v. City of Albuquerque, 1957-NMSC-006, 62 N.M. 208, 307 P.2d 792.\n\nIV. PLEADING AND PRACTICE.\n\nAnswer.— In action for mandamus to compel levy of tax to satisfy judgment, the respondents, relying on the alleged fact that the town's certificates of indebtedness were issued for current indebtedness, should have raised the issue by answer, instead of demurring to alternative writ of mandamus.State ex rel. Chesher v. Beall, 1937-NMSC-079, 41 N.M. 652, 73 P.2d 329.\n\nAvailability of mandamus.— If previous special levies produced a sufficient amount to satisfy a judgment against a town, and portions thereof were unlawfully diverted to other purposes, the Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) would not bar application for mandamus to compel a new levy.State ex rel. Chesher v. Beall, 1937-NMSC-079, 41 N.M. 652, 73 P.2d 329.\n\nConstitutional questions.— In a mandamus proceeding to compel levy of a tax to pay a judgment, in absence of evidence to show that combined tax rate for state and local purposes would exceed the constitutional limitation, no constitutional question is presented, for neither the statutory limitation nor the prohibitions of the Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) will shield the county from a forced levy to satisfy a tort judgment, and the holder of such judgment is entitled to mandamus against the state tax commission to approve levy of taxes for its payment.State ex rel. Martin v. Harris, 1941-NMSC-032, 45 N.M. 335, 115 P.2d 80.\n\nAllegation of violation of Bateman Act held premature.— Prior to approval by the state engineer of a municipality's applications to appropriate underground water, it is premature to allege that a contract involving a municipal water supply violates the Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978).City of Hobbs v. State ex rel. Reynolds, 1970-NMSC-133, 82 N.M. 102, 476 P.2d 500.\n\nWhere a municipality files applications with the state engineer to appropriate underground water, only if such applications are approved will any type of purchase financing be required and only subsequent to such approval could the amount of the obligation be ascertainable, in which event such financing might be accomplished by means which would satisfy the requisites of either 3-27-5 NMSA 1978 or this section.City of Hobbs v. State ex rel. Reynolds, 1970-NMSC-133, 82 N.M. 102, 476 P.2d 500.\n\nExhaustion of current funds is defense.— This section does not permit the rendition of a judgment against a county for current expenses where the complaint shows on its face that the claim on which judgment is sought has been allowed by the county commissioners, and the payment denied or refused for want of funds.Optic Publ'g Co. v. Board of Comm'rs, 1921-NMSC-088, 27 N.M. 371, 202 P. 124.\n\nInsufficient funds defense.— No judgment can be rendered against a county on a claim for current indebtedness arising out of the publication of the delinquent tax list where such claim has been presented and allowed, and payment thereon refused or denied on account of insufficient funds with which to pay it.Sena v. Board of Comm'rs, 1921-NMSC-094, 27 N.M. 461, 202 P. 984.\n\nInsufficient funds defense not applicable where due to unlawful diversion of funds.— A county creditor whose claim cannot be paid because of exhaustion of appropriate fund of the current year must bear the loss, except for his right to participate with other creditors in subsequent collections of revenue belonging to that year; but such exhaustion is no defense if it was due to an unlawful diversion.Las Vegas Indep. Publ'g Co. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1931-NMSC-033, 35 N.M. 486, 1 P.2d 564.\n\nBateman Act not defense where funds from special tax levy diverted to other purposes.— The Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) is no defense to an action to recover judgment on certificates of indebtedness issued by a county in anticipation of the collection of a special tax levy, and payable from the proceeds of that levy, where the levy produced sufficient funds to pay the certificates, but the funds were diverted to other purposes.Capital City Bank v. Board of Comm'rs, 1921-NMSC-112, 27 N.M. 541, 203 P. 535.\n\nViolation of Bateman Act must be pleaded and proved.— A violation of the Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) in the employment of teachers for a municipal school is a defensive matter which must be pleaded and proved in an action for breach of contract for discharge of a teacher.Landers v. Board of Educ., 1941-NMSC-039, 45 N.M. 446, 116 P.2d 690.\n\nPleading affirmative defense of violation of act.— The Bateman Act (Sections 6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded and proven with the burden upon the party asserting it to so prove its application. Where city had not shown that required funds were unavailable at the time that resolution in question was duly passed by the city council to pay for the contractual services of the plaintiff, the act was not applicable.National Civil Serv. League v. City of Santa Fe, 370 F. Supp. 1128 (D.N.M. 1973).\n\nBurden of proof of applicability of Act.— A party relying upon the Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) has the burden of pleading and proving its application.McAtee v. Gutierrez, 1944-NMSC-001, 48 N.M. 100, 146 P.2d 315.\n\nDevelopment agreements.— A home rule municipality has the authority to enter into a contract with a private developer in order to facilitate the construction of retail business establishments, which contract provides for the reimbursement or forgiveness of impact fees, so long as the reimbursement comes from a special fund dedicated for that special purpose. 2002 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 02-02.\n\nContract for salary during second year of contract term.— A contract between a local school board and a school administrator may provide for a specific salary during the second year of the contract term without violating the Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) but only if the board commits funds from the fiscal year of contracting to pay the salaries for both years and funds from any other fiscal year are not necessary to pay the salaries. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-55.\n\nContract paying monthly sum for 25 years.— A contract that would pay a contractor a certain sum each month for the next 25 years for privately operating a prison violates the Bateman Act, (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978), in that it presently obligates unconditional future payments of money for future services to be rendered. 1983 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 83-05.\n\nContracts for school yearbooks which extend beyond current year.— Since the money for school yearbooks is not collected except for the current year, it is a violation of the Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) for a school district to continue with contracts for their publication which extend beyond the current year. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-17.\n\nLong-term leases.— The Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) does not prohibit a school district from entering into long-term leases. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-23.\n\nContracts, as well as actual indebtedness, are covered by this section.— The prohibition of this section relates not only to becoming indebted, but also to the contracting of debts which are not or cannot be paid out of money actually collected and belonging to the current year. 1965 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-53.\n\nCollections not payable on indebtedness of another year.A municipal corporation may not pay from funds of the current fiscal year several old accounts payable, even though current funds are sufficient to pay such obligations. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-41.\n\nDate of abandonment of project determines year in which obligation payable.— Where a contract for engineering was made in 1954 and formal abandonment of the project was made in 1956, the town could make payment out of current funds for these services, as the act of abandonment created the obligation to pay for the services under the terms of the contract. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6535.\n\nVacation time for county employees cannot be accumulated beyond current yearand be paid for out of the succeeding year's budget. County officers and employees are entitled to a lawful vacation period, but if they waive the same and elect to work during their vacation period, they may not be paid an additional amount for such work. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6121.\n\nIndebtedness to federal government.— The Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) does not apply to an indebtedness of a municipality to the federal government. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6483.\n\nContract prohibited if not payable in current year.— This section prohibits a county board of education from entering into a contract which cannot be paid out of the money actually collected and belonging to that current year. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6443.\n\nLater collections for current year may be distributed pro rata among creditors.— County obligations must be paid from revenues available for year or be null and void except that moneys collected later belonging to such year may be distributed pro rata among creditors. 1937 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 37-1705.\n\nReduction of salaries of deputy county officers.— The board of county commissioners of a second class county has no authority to reduce salaries of deputy county officers below amount provided by law, especially where full amount of such salaries for year was duly budgeted, although all county officers have to bear pro rata reduction in order to limit expenditures of year to its income. 1937 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 37-1649.\n\nFailure by county commission to levy tax to pay interest on school district bonds.— A school district cannot borrow money to pay interest on its bonds, which were issued validly, when county commissioners fail to levy tax for such purpose, and one district cannot loan money to another for such purpose out of moneys in its sinking fund. 1931 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 31-81.\n\nCollections for particular current year may be applied on indebtedness for that year,regardless of when such collections are made. 1932 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 32-383.\n\nCollections not payable on indebtedness of another year.— Collections made during any current year, for such year, cannot be applied on indebtedness for another year. 1932 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 32-383.\n\nCounty board of education may borrow money to pay warrants of school teachersto avoid the necessity of discounting the warrants. 1921 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 21-2785.\n\nSchool expenditures.— The Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978) applies to school expenditures as well as to all others. 1921 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 21-3186.\n\nWarrants limited by tax levy and not by amount of money actually collected.— A county board of education may lawfully issue warrants to the amount of the levy for the year in which said warrants are issued, and they are not limited to the amount of money actually collected. 1919 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 19-2430.\n\nMoney need not be on hand when warrants issued if warrants limited to current year funds.— School district warrants may be approved, even though the funds may not be on hand to meet them, provided the warrants so drawn will not run beyond what can be paid from the funds of the current year. 1915 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 15-1505.\n\nFloating indebtedness prohibited.— There can be no outstanding floating indebtedness in excess of current revenue collections for the same year under the Bateman Act (6-6-11 and 6-6-13 to 6-6-18 NMSA 1978). 1913 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13-1137.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —56 Am. Jur. 2d Municipal Corporations, Counties, and Other Political Subdivisions § 594; 68 Am.
