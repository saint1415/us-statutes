The council may hire investment management or consulting firms to advise the council with respect to the council's investment decisions for the investment of funds managed by the investment office and pay reasonable compensation for such management or consulting services from the assets of the applicable funds, subject to budgeting and appropriation by the legislature. The terms of any such investment management or consulting services contract shall incorporate the statutory requirements for investment of funds under the council's jurisdiction. Prior to being hired, a prospective investment management, advisory or consulting services firm shall submit to the council a disclosure detailing all campaign contributions made within the last two years by the firm or the principals of the firm to any member of the council, or to a political committee or other entity that is intended to aid or promote the nomination or election of any council member to a political office.\n\nD.

Notwithstanding any statutory provision governing state agency investments, the council may invest funds available from a state agency pursuant to a joint powers agreement in any type of investment permitted for the land grant permanent funds under the prudent investor rule. In performing investment services for a state agency, the council and the state investment officer and investment office staff are exempt from the New Mexico Uniform Securities Act [58-13C-101 to 58-13C-701 NMSA 1978].

The contract did not delegate nondelegable duties to the advisor, and the advisor was therefore estopped to assert that doctrine as a bar to suit on the contract.State ex rel. Udall v. Colonial Penn Ins. Co., 1991-NMSC-048, 112 N.M. 123, 812 P.2d 777.\n\nInvestment officer has only powers granted by constitution or statute.— The investment officer is a creature of statute, being unknown at common law, and has only those powers and rights granted to him by the constitution and legislative enactment. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-49.\n\nRequirements for exchange of securities.— The requirement of this section, as it pertains to an exchange, is that the securities which are to be received in the exchange must have an aggregate price which is equal to or in excess of the market price of the securities which are to be given by the state. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-09.\n\nDetermination of \"market price\".— The generally accepted definition or meaning of the term \"market price\" indicates that the words imply price or value in an open market where one desires but is not compelled to buy and one is willing but not compelled to sell. In order for an item to have a market price, the same or similar items must have been sold enough times so that the items obtain a somewhat fixed price or value to purchasers. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-09.\n\nMere combining of funds from several trusts for investmentdoes not violate intermingling rule. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-09.\n\nInvestment officer may sell or exchange securities held in portfolio.— This section confers upon the investment officer the power to sell and exchange securities originally held in the state portfolio. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-09.\n\nInvestment not limited to current funds.— The primary purpose for the creation of the investment council was to improve the position of the permanent fund in regard to its investments generally, and specifically, its return on the funds invested, keeping in mind the preservation of the principal. This goal could not be accomplished if the powers of the council were limited to investing only current funds. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-09.\n\nCapital gains from sale of common stock may not be used to offset loss on sale of fixed-income security.— Since the 1965 amendment to N.M. Const., art. XII, § 7, the state investment council has not had the power to sell common stocks realizing a capital gain and use such gain to offset a loss taken on the sale of a fixed-income security. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-116.\n\nSale at loss which cannot be made up by increased interest income.— The state investment officer has the power and the duty to sell fixed income securities at less than their original acquisition cost and take a loss which cannot be made up by increased interest income where, in his discretion, such action is consistent with the protection and preservation of the permanent fund. While the loss must be reimbursed, it is up to the legislature to effect it; accordingly, in the event of a loss, the state investment council should inform the legislature thereof. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-19.\n\nCommitment for purchase prior to actual investment.— Investment council can make definite commitment for purchase of Capehart mortgages prior to actual investment in them. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-160.\n\nEmployment of management company constitutes unlawful delegation of powers.— If a management company is to be of any real value to the investment council, it must by the very nature of its duties possess a portion of the decision-making powers of the investment officer. This is an unlawful delegation of the investment power of the investment officer. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-49.",
