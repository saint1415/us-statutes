      "text": "A. It is found and declared that there exists a substantial financial market for a public body's public securities structured for short-term interest rates which traditionally bear a lesser rate of interest than long-term public securities; that public bodies of this state have not been provided with statutory authority to take advantage of such lower interest rates which has resulted in public bodies paying higher interest rates on their public securities, exacting an unnecessary financial premium from the public bodies and the residents of this state, and impairing the public bodies' ability to obtain responsible, low cost financing for the promotion of the health, safety, security and general welfare of the citizens of the public bodies and of the peoples of the state of New Mexico; that it is a matter of state policy and concern that public bodies shall not continue to pay interest on their public securities at rates higher than those available on bonds issued under the Public Securities Short-Term Interest Rate Act, and that unnecessary consumption of the public bodies' revenue be prevented.\n\nB. It is a matter of state policy and concern that public bodies be provided flexibility in structuring their public securities to take advantage of lower interest rates offered in financial markets for all types and kinds of public securities; that public bodies be authorized and empowered to issue public securities which provide for short-term interest rates, variable interest rates, renewals and refundings of such securities, giving holders the right to put the public security for repurchase before maturity, with related accompanying provisions, and other features which will enhance the marketability of public securities and result in a lower interest cost to the public body.\n\nC. The legislature finds that the ability to take advantage of lower interest rates accorded to public securities structured for short-term interest rates is appropriate for the public bodies of this state because of the size and magnitude of the financing required to support the public bodies. The legislature further finds and declares that the strategies and methods for solving the financing problems of public bodies differ from those in other counties, cities, towns and villages of the state, and it is necessary to authorize public bodies additional powers and flexibility because of the nature and size of their problems and because the governments and governing bodies of such public bodies have sufficient staff to meet and deal with those problems.\n\nHistory:Laws 1983, ch. 161, § 2; 1986, ch. 60, § 2.",

Subject to any applicable limitations on indebtedness, with respect to refunding bonds, there may be included in the principal amount, and paid from the proceeds, of bonds issued pursuant to the Public Securities Short-Term Interest Rate Act capitalized interest for three years or such longer period as may otherwise be authorized by law. The proceeds of any levy of property taxes to the extent levied for interest on indebtedness for any period of time covered by such capitalized interest may be used to reimburse the improvement fund for the previous payment of interest from such fund.\n\nB. To the extent that bonds issued pursuant to the Public Securities Short-Term Interest Rate Act constitute indebtedness, the officials now or hereafter charged by law with the duty of levying general (ad valorem) taxes for the payment of bonds and interest shall, in the manner provided by law, make an annual levy sufficient to meet the payments of principal and interest on such bonds maturing. Nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to prevent the municipal corporation from applying any other funds that may be in the treasury or investment income actually received from sinking fund investments and available for that purpose, or the proceeds of renewal or refunding bonds or any other funds lawfully available therefor to the payment of the interest on or the principal of or any prior redemption premium in connection with such bonds as the same become due; and the levy or levies of taxes may be diminished to the extent such other revenues are or will be available for the payment of principal and interest of the bonds. Any levy of property taxes for interest on indebtedness for any year may be for the maximum interest that may be payable under the applicable bond legislation in the year in which such levy is collected. If, after provision for payment of interest in that year, there is any amount remaining from the collection of property taxes levied for such interest, it shall be used in succeeding years for the payment of interest on the bonds, and the levy for the succeeding years to provide money for the payment of principal of and interest on the bonds shall be reduced accordingly, except that any such remainder may be used at any time for payment of principal of the bonds if and to the extent permitted by the bond proceedings, provided that the bond legislation shall permit the eventual application of all money collected from such levies to the payment of principal of and interest on indebtedness.\n\nHistory:Laws 1983, ch. 161, § 12.",
