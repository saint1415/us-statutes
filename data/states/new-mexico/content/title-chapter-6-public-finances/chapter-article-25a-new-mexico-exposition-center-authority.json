The appointed members shall serve at the pleasure of the governor.\n\nC. The appointed members of the authority shall be appointed to four-year terms. The initial members shall be appointed to staggered terms of four years or less, so that the term of at least one member expires on January 1 of each year. Vacancies shall be filled by appointment by the governor for the remainder of the unexpired term. An appointed member shall continue to serve beyond the expiration of the member's term until a new member is appointed. Any member shall be eligible for reappointment.\n\nD. Each appointed member before entering upon the member's duties shall take an oath of office to administer the duties of office faithfully and impartially. A record of the oath shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state.\n\nE. The governor shall designate an appointed member of the authority to serve as chair. The authority shall elect annually one of its members to serve as vice chair. The authority shall appoint and prescribe the duties of such other officers, who need not be members, as the authority deems necessary or advisable, including an executive director and a secretary, who may be the same person. The authority may delegate to one or more of its members, officers, employees or agents such powers and duties as it may deem proper and consistent with the New Mexico Exposition Center Authority Act.\n\nF. The executive director of the authority shall direct the affairs and business of the authority, subject to the policies, control and direction of the authority.

Meetings of the authority shall be held at the call of the chair or whenever three members shall so request in writing. A majority of members then serving constitutes a quorum for the transaction of any business. The affirmative vote of at least a majority of a quorum present shall be necessary for any action to be taken by the authority.

No vacancy in the membership of the authority shall impair the right of a quorum to exercise all rights and perform all duties of the authority.\n\nH.

No part of the revenues or assets of the authority shall benefit or be distributable to its members, officers or other private persons.

The authority shall not be subject to the supervision or control of any other board, bureau, department or agency of the state except as specifically provided in the New Mexico Exposition Center Authority Act. No use of the terms \"state agency\" or \"instrumentality\" in any other law of the state shall be deemed to refer to the authority unless the authority is specifically referred to in the law.\n\nK.
