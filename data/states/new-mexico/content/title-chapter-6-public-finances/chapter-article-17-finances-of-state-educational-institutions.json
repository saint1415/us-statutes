Each such board is hereby authorized to enter into agreements with the United States whereby it or an institution under its control is to receive such payments. Any board of regents may, notwithstanding any other provisions of these sections, pledge to the payment of the bonds the gross revenues to be derived from the operation of any buildings and facilities, the revenues of which are otherwise authorized to be pledged. The board of regents may also pledge to the payment of the bonds any of its revenues derived from sources other than the proceeds of ad valorem taxes, including land grant revenues, income from the permanent fund of the institution and income of the institution derived from the lease or rental of lands or other property of the institution. If gross revenues are so pledged, and if the revenues do not include land grant revenues or income from the permanent fund or income from leases and rentals, the board of regents may apply all or any part of these unpledged sources of revenue to the payment of the expense of maintaining and operating the buildings and facilities, the gross revenues of which are pledged, and may, in the proceedings authorizing the bonds, agree to apply to the payment of the maintenance and operation expenses as much of the revenues as is necessary for these purposes, or as is specified in the proceedings.\n\nB. Where revenues are pledged under this section, the determination required by Section 6-17-2 NMSA 1978 need not be made. References appearing elsewhere in Chapter 73, Article 29 NMSA 1953, to the net revenues or income from buildings, facilities or improvements shall be construed to refer to all revenues pledged under the provisions of the proceedings authorizing the bonds.\n\nC.

In addition to all other powers granted, any board of education or board of regents may issue bonds for the purpose of refunding, for not less than the principal amount of any bonds issued by it under Chapter 73, Article 29 NMSA 1953, or under any other law. The board may also issue bonds in part for the purpose of refunding the bonds and in part for the purpose of providing additional funds to acquire or construct any building, facility, improvement, alteration, addition or extension or any combination, including furnishings and equipment, for which bonds are authorized to be issued by the board. Except as provided in this section, the bonds shall mature, bear interest, have such details and be authorized and issued in the manner provided for the authorization and issuance of other bonds. Refunding bonds issued may carry forward for the benefit of the refunding bonds the security and sources of payment as were pledged to the payment of the bonds refunded, or may make changes in security and sources of payment deemed advisable by the board. There shall not be pledged to the payment of the bonds any source of revenue not authorized in Chapter 73, Article 29 NMSA 1953, to be pledged to the payment of bonds issued under that chapter.\n\nB. Any bonds issued for refunding purposes may be delivered in exchange for the outstanding bonds authorized to be refunded, or sold at public or private sale for not less than the par value of the bonds, or sold in part and exchanged in part. If sold, the proceeds shall be immediately applied to the retirement of the bonds to be refunded, or the proceeds, or the obligations in which they are invested as permitted by law, shall be placed in escrow to be held and applied to payment of the bonds to be refunded.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 73-29-14.1, enacted by Laws 1957, ch. 245, § 3; 1963, ch. 297, § 2.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Chapter 73, Article 29 NMSA 1953 is now compiled as 6-17-1, 6-17-2 to 6-17-19, 21-1-26 and 21-1-27 to 21-1-33 NMSA 1978.",

Where refunding bonds are sold, the net proceeds may, in the discretion of the issuing board, be invested in obligations of the United States or any of its agencies, or in obligations fully guaranteed by the United States, but the obligations purchased must have maturities and bear rates of interest payable at times to ensure the existence of money sufficient to pay the bonds to be refunded when due or when redeemed pursuant to call for redemption, together with interest and redemption premiums, if any.\n\nE. As used in this section, \"net proceeds\" means the gross proceeds of the bonds after deduction of all accrued interest and expenses incurred in connection with the authorization and issuance of the bonds and the refunding of the outstanding bonds, including fiscal agent fees and commissions and all discounts incurred in the resale of the refunding bonds by the original purchaser.\n\nF. All obligations purchased with refunding bond proceeds shall be deposited in trust with a bank doing business in this state and a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation, to be held, liquidated and the proceeds of the liquidation paid out for payment of the bonds to be refunded, along with interest and redemption premiums, as the refunded bonds become due or subject to redemption under call for redemption previously made, or upon earlier voluntary surrender with the consent of the issuing board.\n\nG.
