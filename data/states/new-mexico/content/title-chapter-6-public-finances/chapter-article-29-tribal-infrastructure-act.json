The legislature finds that:\n\n(1) tribes lack basic infrastructure resulting in poor social, health and economic conditions of tribal communities;\n\n(2) adequate infrastructure such as water and wastewater systems, major water systems, electrical power lines, communications, roads, health and emergency response facilities and infrastructure needed for economic development are essential to improved health, safety and welfare of all New Mexicans, including residents of tribal communities;\n\n(3) local tribal efforts and resources have been insufficient to develop and maintain a consistent and adequate level of infrastructure in tribal communities;\n\n(4) addressing the urgent need of replacing, improving and developing tribal infrastructure through the use of an alternative financing mechanism is a long-term cost savings benefit to both the state and the tribes; and\n\n(5) adequate infrastructure development on tribal land will allow tribal members to achieve the basic conditions necessary to improve the quality of their lives.\n\nB. The purposes of the Tribal Infrastructure Act are to:\n\n(1) ensure adequate financial resources for infrastructure development for tribal communities;\n\n(2) provide for the planning and development of infrastructure in an efficient and cost-effective manner; and\n\n(3) develop infrastructure in tribal communities to improve the quality of life and encourage economic development.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 9-21-18, enacted by Laws 2005, ch. 146, § 2; recompiled as § 6-29-2 by Laws 2008, ch. 81, § 4.",
