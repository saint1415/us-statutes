The department of finance and administration shall select a qualified arbitrator to arbitrate for zoning conflicts between the land grant-merced and neighboring municipalities and counties.\n\nHistory:Laws 2007, ch. 145, § 4.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2007, ch. 145, § 22 made Laws 2007, ch. 145, § 4 effective July 1, 2007.\n\nPower to sue and be sued.— The Chilili land grant board of trustees has the power to sue and be sued, which is necessarily implied from the express legislative grant of authority to pass ordinances and to sell and convey real property.Shearton Dev. Co. v. Town of Chilili Land Grant, 2003-NMCA-120, 134 N.M. 611, 78 P.3d 525, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-001, 134 N.M. 611, 81 P.3d 554 (decided under prior law).\n\nAuthority to sell and convey common lands.— Board of trustees of Chilili land grant was creature of legislature, and had only such powers as were conferred upon it, and no authority to sell the common land.Merrifield v. Buckner, 1937-NMSC-045, 41 N.M. 442, 70 P.2d 896 (decided under prior law).\n\nDeed, executed by board of trustees of Chilili land grant, purporting to convey common land, was void for want of authority in the board to sell the common land, and grantees and their successors, in absence of adverse possession, were without title.Merrifield v. Buckner, 1937-NMSC-045, 41 N.M. 442, 70 P.2d 896 (decided under prior law).\n\nPlaintiff's claim that several authorizations and requests purportedly signed by a number of residents of the town, authorizing the board of trustees to convey all grant lands to the defendant association, were fraudulent and granted no authority to the board of trustees is of no significance, since the 1943 amendment to this section empowered the board of trustees to sell and convey common lands of the grant without the approval of the residents of the town and the deed from the board was dated subsequent to the effective date of the 1943 amendment.Moya v. Chilili Coop. Ass'n, 1974-NMSC-100, 87 N.M. 99, 529 P.2d 1220, cert. denied, 421 U.S. 965, 95 S. Ct. 1954, 44 L. Ed. 2d 452 (1975) (decided under prior law).\n\nNo failure or inadequacy of consideration or construction fraud.— Where prior to the conveyance of the grant lands to a cooperative association for $1.00 the whole of the grant lands had been deeded to the state for delinquent taxes, and the farmers home loan administration, as a condition precedent to making a loan with which to redeem the lands, required the formation of the association and the conveyance to it of the grant lands, so that the lands were deeded to the association, the loan was obtained by the association, the delinquent taxes were paid and the lands redeemed by the association, there was no failure or inadequacy of consideration or constructive fraud on the part of the board.Moya v. Chilili Coop. Ass'n, 1974-NMSC-100, 87 N.M. 99, 529 P.2d 1220, cert. denied, 421 U.S. 965, 95 S. Ct. 1954, 44 L. Ed. 2d 452 (1975) (decided under prior law).\n\nNo reason for board's existence after conveyance.— The governing authority of boards of trustees of land grants is in the nature of that exercised by quasi-municipal corporations whose principal, if not only, function is to hold title to and manage common lands. Since the board had authority to sell and convey any or all of the grant's common lands, when these lands were conveyed to the association, the right of the \"heirs\" of the grant to elect a board of trustees was not directly destroyed, but there was no reason for the board's continued existence. The loss of the reason for the existence of the board resulted from the exercise by the board of its legitimate authority and power.Moya v. Chilili Coop. Ass'n, 1974-NMSC-100, 87 N.M. 99, 529 P.2d 1220, cert. denied, 421 U.S. 965, 95 S. Ct. 1954, 44 L. Ed. 2d 452 (1975) (decided under prior law).",
