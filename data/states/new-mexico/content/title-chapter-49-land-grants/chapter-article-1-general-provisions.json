Wells Fargo Bank N.M., N.A., 2008-NMCA-005, 143 N.M. 269, 175 P.3d 937,aff'd, 2010-NMSC-017, 148 N.M. 127, 231 P.3d 108.\n\nThird party claim.— The district court did not have jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs' claim of title to a portion of the Tecolote land grant under the provisions of the congressional confirmation and patent, which provided that they \"shall not affect any adverse valid rights\" where plaintiffs' predecessors in interest had participated in proceedings to challenge the issuance of the patent as a community grant and lost, plaintiffs' claim sought to convert a portion of the land grant from a community land grant into private property and the grant to plaintiff's predecessors in title had not been confirmed.Montoya v. Tecolote Land Grant, 2008-NMCA-014, 143 N.M. 413, 176 P.3d 1145, cert. quashed, 2008-NMCERT-010, 145 N.M. 524, 201 P.3d 855.\n\nApplication of Montoya v. Tecolote Land Grant, 2008-NMCA-014, to land covered by a stipulated order granting title to Montoya.— Where, in 1999, Montoya filed an action against the land grant to quiet title to 19,320 acres within the land grant; the land grant counterclaimed to quiet title against Montoya; the land grant claimed no common lands within the property known as the \"Montoya ranch\" which consisted of approximately 5,000 acres within the larger 19,320 acre tract and the district court entered a stipulated judgment that Montoya had title against the land grant to the Montoya ranch; in 2008, in Montoya v. Tecolote Land Grant, 2008-NMCA-014, the court of appeals held that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to determine title because the district court had no authority to alter the terms of the congressional confirmation of the United States patent to the land grant as a community land grant; and in 2010, the land grant sued Montoya alleging that underMontoya, the district court did not have jurisdiction to enter the stipulated judgment confirming title to the Montoya ranch inMontoya, the district court had subject matter jurisdiction in the 1999 case over the land grant's counterclaim and jurisdiction to confirm the party's agreement by entering the stipulated judgment quieting title to the Montoya ranch inMontoya, the stipulated judgment removed the issue of the ownership of the Montoya ranch from the litigation,Montoyawas limited to the dispute over the remaining portion of the 19,320 acres, excluding the Montoya ranch, and given the agreement that the Montoya ranch was not land grant common land, the stipulated judgment did not result in an impermissible alteration or alter the origin, nature, character, or size of the land grant.Tecolote Land Grant v.

Town of Cubero Land Grant, 1958-NMSC-137, 65 N.M. 103, 332 P.2d 1020.\n\nEstoppel from questioning land interests.— Where those under whom plaintiffs claim interest in common lands of Atrisco land grant procured incorporation of the town of Atrisco on the claim the grant was communal and procured decree of the court of private land claims similarly holding the grant to be communal, they have participated in its operation as such a grant for too long a time now to question their interest.Armijo v. Town of Atrisco, 1951-NMSC-085, 56 N.M. 2, 239 P.2d 535.\n\nCongressional act conclusive.— Where congress has confirmed grant as a private land grant, without qualification or limitation, the confirmatory act of congress is final and conclusive and court may not go behind that act and determine the character or nature of the grant from antecedent documents.Martinez v. Rivera,196 F.2d 192 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 828, 73 S. Ct. 30, 97 L. Ed. 644 (1952).\n\nCorporation rules applicable to grants.— While a grant organized under this section would not be a corporation, it would be so nearly a corporation in its nature that the same rules should apply. 1944 Op.

It is an authorization and direction for the creation of the machinery to perform such a function. The elective process therein involved does not change its character. There is no continuing supervision or control by the state over the trustees or what they do, nor is there a continuing relationship.Mondragon v. Tenorio, 554 F.2d 423 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 905, 98 S. Ct. 305, 54 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1977).\n\nPower of board of trusteescomes from the statutes providing for its creation. Where the mode of exercising this power is prescribed by the statutes, there must be substantial compliance therewith.Bibo v. Town of Cubero Land Grant, 1958-NMSC-137, 65 N.M. 103, 332 P.2d 1020.\n\nLack of standing in quiet title suit.— Where a land grant association's board of trustees had not called an election by its members or the trustees as required by law and had not identified the persons having an interest in the lands claimed by the association who had a right to vote at an election and the treasurer had not furnished a surety bond, the association lacked standing as a land grant community or board to assert a claim of title to lands at issue in a suit to quiet title.Cordova v.

Town of Cubero Land Grant, 1958-NMSC-137, 65 N.M. 103, 332 P.2d 1020.\n\nGrant lands which are subject to taxation cannot be sold without approval of the boardexcept in proceedings to enforce the payment of taxes.Cebolleta Land Grant ex rel. Bd. of Trustees v. Romero, 1982-NMSC-043, 98 N.M. 1, 644 P.2d 515.\n\nNoncomplying lease void.— A written lease of a portion of the common lands of the grant for a period of five years with an option to renew for five more years was void in the absence of compliance with the provisions of this section.Bibo v. Town of Cubero Land Grant, 1958-NMSC-137, 65 N.M. 103, 332 P.2d 1020.\n\nII. DISTRICT COURT APPROVAL.\n\nPurpose of 1913 amendment.— The history of this section reveals that the 1913 amendment to the original provision substituted the requirement of the approval of the district court for that of the approval of a majority of the qualified voters of such grant, the purpose no doubt being for the protection of the owners of common interests in the land grant against fraud, collusion, mistake or inequities, as well as for the convenience of the board in carrying on business for the grant owners.Bibo v. Town of Cubero Land Grant, 1958-NMSC-137, 65 N.M. 103, 332 P.2d 1020.\n\nDistrict court's duties.— This section authorizes the district judge to make certain that a board of trustees complies with the formalities of issuance of a lease it has authorized and to require the board to apply its standards in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner.Maestas v. Board of Trustees, 1985-NMSC-068, 103 N.M. 77, 703 P.2d 174.\n\nApproval of district court is essentialto the validity of a transaction coming within this provision just as the approval of a majority of the qualified voters would have been under the old provision.Bibo v. Town of Cubero Land Grant, 1958-NMSC-137, 65 N.M. 103, 332 P.2d 1020.\n\nApproval contemplated in sectiondoes not extend to anything more than the final act of the trustees, and in no way to the manner in which they arrived there. There is no indication in the statute that the district judge is to do anything more than to see that the formalities of issuance are observed. The requirement for approval does not extend to an approval of the matters and considerations leading up to the execution of the lease by the trustees, nor to standards, nor to rental. The action of the district court is on leases already issued, and not as to the rejection of applications to lease.Mondragon v. Tenorio, 554 F.2d 423 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 905, 98 S.
