      "text": "That all corporations organized and incorporated under the provisions of an act of the legislative assembly of the territory of New Mexico, approved February 26, 1891, and published as Chapter 86 of the Session Laws of 1891, or under the provisions of an act of the legislative assembly of the territory of New Mexico, approved March 18, 1897, and published as Chapter 54 of the Session Laws of 1897, shall have the powers granted by this act for the purposes hereinafter mentioned.\n\nHistory:Laws 1917, ch. 3, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 29-201; 1941 Comp., § 9-201; 1953 Comp., § 8-2-1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 1891, ch. 86 and Laws 1897, ch. 54, referred to in this section, are repealed by Laws 1917, ch. 3, § 19.See\"Saving clauses\" in notes to 49-2-17 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe term \"this act\" refers to Laws 1917, ch. 3, §§ 1 to 20, compiled as 49-2-1 to 49-2-17 NMSA 1978.\n\nConstitutional violation by distribution plan.— The plan of distribution of community grant land proposed disclosed a pronounced absence of primary and elemental concepts of due process and equal protection of the laws, in violation of constitutional guaranties existing in favor of owners of the beneficial interest in the common lands of the grant, where interests in land were to be determined by drawings in a lottery and where it was uncertain how it was to be determined by the special master, who were the owners of beneficial interests in the common lands eligible for participation in the lottery.Armijo v. Town of Atrisco, 1957-NMSC-045, 62 N.M. 440, 312 P.2d 91.\n\nDistribution plan contrary to law.— The means to be employed for making a distribution of the lands of the grant not only amounted to a violation of the statute law of this state prohibiting lotteries, but as well amounted to a dissipation of the assets of the corporation, contrary to law, where interests in land were to be determined by drawings in a lottery and where it was uncertain how it was determined, by the special master, who were the owners of beneficial interests in the common lands, eligible for participation in the lottery.Armijo v. Town of Atrisco, 1957-NMSC-045, 62 N.M. 440, 312 P.2d 91.\n\nConstitutional prohibitions against special legislation held inapplicable.— In view of the difference in the nature and origin of the different community land grants; in view of the long legislative history of enactments relating to the control, or management, of the lands of specific grants; in view of the fact that there is some discretion in the legislature to determine in which cases special laws should be passed; and in view of the presumptions indulged in favor of the validity of legislation, supreme court held that the prohibitions against special legislation as contained in the Springer Act, former 48 U.S.C. § 1471, and in N.M. Const., art. IV, § 24, were not applicable to enactments relating to the governing or managing bodies of the Las Vegas grant or any specific community land grants, or to the manner in which these bodies exercise their powers of control, management and disposition over grant lands.Board of Trustees v. Montano, 1971-NMSC-025, 82 N.M. 340, 481 P.2d 702.\n\nCommunity land grant is in the nature of a quasi-municipal corporationand is governed by the rules of law applicable thereto. The power of the board of trustees comes from the statutes providing for its creation.Apodaca v. Tome Land & Improvement Co., 1978-NMSC-018, 91 N.M. 591, 577 P.2d 1237.\n\nComptroller's jurisdiction.— The San Antonio de las Huertas grant and water commission is a public grant, and the state comptroller, consequently, has jurisdiction over it under this article. 1952 Op.

Const., art. VIII, § 7.Board of Trustees v. Sedillo, 1922-NMSC-027, 28 N.M. 53, 210 P. 102).\n\nPresumption is that public officials perform their duties.Davis v. Westland Dev. Co., 1970-NMSC-039, 81 N.M. 296, 466 P.2d 862.\n\nLack of standing in quiet title suit.— Where a land grant association's board of trustees had not called an election by its members or the trustees as required by law and had not identified the persons having an interest in the lands claimed by the association who had a right to vote at an election and the treasurer had not furnished a surety bond, the association lacked standing as a land grant community or board to assert a claim of title to lands at issue in a suit to quiet title.Cordova v. Broadbent, 1988-NMSC-042, 107 N.M. 215, 755 P.2d 59.\n\nIrrelevant proof as to deed.— Proof that deeds relied upon by grantees of town property were signed by different people and that grantees were not heirs of land grant was irrelevant on question of forgery and inadequacy of description.Davis v. Westland Dev. Co., 1970-NMSC-039, 81 N.M. 296, 466 P.2d 862.\n\nValid heirs hold title as tenants in common.— All the valid heirs to a community land grant are considered to hold title as tenants in common.Apodaca v.

Bd. of Trustees v. Romero, 1982-NMSC-043, 98 N.M. 1, 644 P.2d 515.\n\nDistribution of proceeds of sale.— Once a town relinquishes its proprietary interest in the common lands by virtue of a sale, the proceeds must necessarily be divided proportionately among the rightful heirs.Apodaca v.

To hold otherwise would produce the absurd implication that a land grant corporation could have been converted into a domestic stock corporation by this section even before the enactment of 49-2-18 NMSA 1978.

      "text": "Twenty or more owners and proprietors of record of a corporation organized under Laws 1891, Chapter 86 may prepare proposed articles of incorporation and bylaws and a plan of conversion for the purpose of converting the existing corporation into a corporation organized under the general corporation law of this state. Upon notice, the proposers shall call a meeting of all owners and proprietors of record entitled to vote in the affairs of the existing corporation. The notice shall be published in English in a newspaper of general circulation in a county in which the existing corporation is located, once a week for three consecutive weeks, the last publication to be not more than thirty days prior to the date set for the meeting. Similar publication shall also be made in Spanish if there is a Spanish language newspaper of general circulation in the county. The proposed articles of incorporation and bylaws and the plan of conversion shall be presented at the meeting, and, if approved by a vote of the majority of the owners and proprietors of record present at the meeting, then, upon the filing of the articles of incorporation and bylaws with the secretary of state and the issuance of a certificate of incorporation, the corporation organized under Laws 1891, Chapter 86 is converted into a domestic corporation authorized to do business and entitled to all privileges and immunities of a domestic corporation organized under the general corporation laws of this state.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 8-2-19, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 43, § 1; 2013, ch. 75, § 14.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 1891, ch. 86, referred to in this section, was repealed by Laws 1917, ch. 3, § 19.See\"Repealing saving clauses\" note to 49-2-17 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective July 1, 2013, required the corporation to file its articles of incorporation and bylaws with the secretary of state; and in the fifth sentence, after \"filing of the articles of incorporation and bylaws with the\", deleted \"state corporation commission\" and added \"secretary of state\".\n\nSection held not to violate due process.— Argument that this section lacked due process because of its failure to require personal service or mailing of written notice of the meeting and failure to provide for absentee voting was without merit since there is no inherent right in a stockholder of a corporation to vote by proxy, and since reasonable notice and a fair opportunity were given to the \"owners and proprietors\" of the grant to attend the meeting at which the proposed corporation was considered.Westland Dev. Co. v. Saavedra, 1969-NMSC-123, 80 N.M. 615, 459 P.2d 141.\n\nWhatever is meant by \"sale\" and \"conveyance\" in 49-2-7 NMSA 1978 does not include the procedure enacted to change the character of the corporation itself. To hold otherwise would produce the absurd implication that a land grant corporation could have been converted into a domestic stock corporation by 49-2-7 NMSA 1978 even before the enactment of this section. It would also produce a rather unexplainable conflict between the two provisions. Therefore, due process was not denied for failure to follow Section 49-2-7 NMSA 1978 since this section was the applicable statute.Westland Dev. Co. v. Saavedra, 1969-NMSC-123, 80 N.M. 615, 459 P.2d 141.\n\nPower of state to alter or amend corporate charter.— Argument that a statute which attempted to change character of a legal entity from that of a corporation for the management of a community land grant to that of a domestic stock corporation was in violation of N.M. Const., art. II, § 18, in that it was an attempt by the legislature to divest the town of its vested rights without due process of law, was without merit since a state, through its police power, could make reasonable regulations of corporations, including alteration or amendment of corporate charters if that power had been duly reserved by the state, as was done in New Mexico.Westland Dev. Co. v. Saavedra, 1969-NMSC-123, 80 N.M. 615, 459 P.2d 141.\n\nIncorrect finding of incorporation.— Since this section was not enacted until 1967, it is obvious that a trial court's finding, before that time, that a community land grant corporation was lawfully qualified as a domestic corporation is incorrect and cannot remain undisturbed.Apodaca v. Tome Land & Improvement Co., 1978-NMSC-018, 91 N.M. 591, 577 P.2d 1237.\n\nVoid private land grant corporation has no right to proceeds from a land saleand no authority to pay such proceeds to its \"shareholders.\" Conversion is present where the \"shareholders\" claim and erroneously receive proceeds of the sale. The party aggrieved cannot be deemed to have discovered she has a cause of action for conversion until the date of the judicial opinion which declares the company in question to be a void corporation.Apodaca v. Unknown Heirs of Tome Land Grant, 1982-NMSC-100, 98 N.M. 620, 651 P.2d 1264.",
