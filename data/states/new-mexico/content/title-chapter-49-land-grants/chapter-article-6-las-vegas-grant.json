Const., art. VIII, § 3, exempting such towns, cities and other municipal corporations from taxation.Davy v. McNeill, 1925-NMSC-040, 31 N.M. 7, 240 P. 482;State v. Board of Trustees, 1922-NMSC-029, 28 N.M. 237, 210 P. 101.\n\nWhere the Las Vegas grant previously had been held for tax purposes not to be a town, city or other municipal corporation within the contemplation of N.M. Const., art. VIII, § 3, such holding was equally applicable within the contemplation of the provisions of the Springer Act, former 48 U.S.C. § 1471, and of N.M. Const., art. IV, § 24.Board of Trustees v. Montano, 1971-NMSC-025, 82 N.M. 340, 481 P.2d 702.\n\nSpecial legislation provisions inapplicable.— In view of the difference in the nature and origin of the different community land grants; in view of the long legislative history of enactments relating to the control, or management, of the lands of specific grants; in view of the fact that there is some discretion in the legislature to determine in which cases special laws should be passed and in view of the presumptions indulged in favor of the validity of legislation, supreme court held that the prohibitions against special legislation as contained in the Springer Act, former 48 U.S.C. § 1471, and in N.M. Const., art. IV, § 24, were not applicable to enactments relating to the governing or managing bodies of the Las Vegas grant or any specific community land grants, or to the manner in which these bodies exercise their powers of control, management and disposition over grant lands.Board of Trustees v. Montano, 1971-NMSC-025, 82 N.M. 340, 481 P.2d 702.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —73B C.J.S. Public Lands § 205.",
