      "text": "In any action where an insured prevails against an insurer who has not paid a claim on any type of first party coverage, the insured person may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and costs of the action upon a finding by the court that the insurer acted unreasonably in failing to pay the claim.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 58-8-36, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 113, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For appellate costs,see39-3-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor no costs being taxed against person seeking reinstatement in employment after leaving armed forces, see 28-15-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor fees collected by supreme court clerk,see34-2-5 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor fees and costs in magistrate courts,see35-6-1 to 35-6-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor costs and attorney fees in garnishment proceedings,see35-12-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor costs paid by county of origin in change of venue,see38-3-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor costs in suit brought by representatives of infant,see38-4-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor costs paid by guardians ad litem,see38-4-17 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor witness fees,see38-6-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor allocation of costs in partition action,see42-5-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor costs in quieting title,see42-6-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor bond for costs in habeas corpus proceeding,see44-1-32 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor costs in quo warranto proceedings,see44-3-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor costs of surety bonds,see46-6-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor costs and attorney fees for prevailing party in suit under Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act,see47-8-48 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor costs and attorney fees in joinder of parties in action for mechanics' and materialmen's liens,see48-2-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor each party paying own costs in review of public service commission orders,see62-13-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor costs and attorney fees in joinder of action for liens on oil and gas wells and pipelines,see70-4-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor costs in special proceedings determining validity of irrigation district bonds,see73-9-59 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor jury fees,seeRule 1-038 NMRA.\n\nFor costs on previously dismissed action,seeParagraph D of Rule 1-041 NMRA.\n\nFor costs of judgments,seeParagraph D of Rule 1-054 NMRA.\n\nFor magistrate court civil trial costs,seeRule 2-701 NMRA.\n\nFor judgment costs in criminal cases,seeRule 5-701 NMRA.\n\nFor costs on appeal,seeRule 12-403 NMRA.\n\nThe purpose of this sectionis to encourage insurers to pay out injury or damage claims promptly without placing on their insureds the unreasonable burden of having to bring a lawsuit to collect what they are entitled to under the policy in order to make themselves whole; however, it is not aimed at holding out the threat of an award of attorney's fees any time an insurer challenges any issue, and is simply designed to encourage insurers to resolve any doubt in favor of the insured and to pay off the claim quickly in order to make the insured whole after a loss.Amica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Maloney, 1995-NMSC-059, 120 N.M. 523, 903 P.2d 834.\n\nThe term \"first party coverage\"applies to the underlying claim for coverage under a policy and not to a subsequent dispute over the amount of subrogation interest which the insurer is entitled to receive.Amica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Maloney, 1995-NMSC-059, 120 N.M. 523, 903 P.2d 834.\n\nFee award on appeal.— This section does not limit the award of attorney's fees to the insured who prevails at trial only, but also includes a fee award for successful defense on appeal.Stock v. Adco Gen. Corp., 1981-NMCA-075, 96 N.M. 544, 632 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 96 N.M. 543, 632 P.2d 1181.\n\nThis section does not limit an award of attorney fees and costs only to trial. In the appropriate case, a first party insured who prevails on appeal may be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs for the appeal.Jessen v. Nat'l Excess Ins. Co., 1989-NMSC-040, 108 N.M. 625, 776 P.2d 1244.\n\nAward of attorney fees and costs on appeal of bad faith claim.— Where the insured was awarded judgment against the insurer because the insurer acted in bad faith in denying coverage and the court of appeals affirmed the judgment, the insured was entitled to attorney fees and costs because Rule 12-403 NMRA allows the court of appeals to award attorney fees for services rendered on appeal in cases where an award of attorney fees is permitted by law, and Section 39-2-1 NMSA 1978 permits a court to award attorney fees in cases in which the court finds that the insurer acted unreasonably in failing to pay a claim.Am. Nat'l. Prop. & Cas. Co. v. Cleveland, 2013-NMCA-013, 293 P.3d 954.\n\nNot unreasonable failure to pay where amount of claimed damages is questionable.— Although an insurer may have unreasonably failed to acknowledge coverage under a policy, since the insurer had a reasonable basis for questioning the amount of claimed damages, it did not act \"unreasonably in failing to pay the claim.\"United Nuclear Corp. v. Allendale Mut. Ins. Co., 1985-NMSC-090, 103 N.M. 480, 709 P.2d 649.\n\nDenial of insurance claim was not unreasonable.— Where insurance company's denial of the insured's claim was not in bad faith, but was based upon evidence accumulated after a reasonable investigation, the insurance company's denial of the insured's claim was not unreasonable and the award of attorney's fees to the insured was not proper.Suggs v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, 833 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1007, 108 S.Ct. 1732, 100 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1988).\n\nStatutory attorney's fees are authorized in favor of insuredupon a finding that the insurance company has acted in bad faith.Yumukoglu v. Provident Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 131 F.Supp. 2d 1215 (D.N.M. 2001).\n\nRequest for attorney fees was timelyeven though the fees were never pled or requested under this section until after the case was disposed of on summary judgment.Sipp v. UNUM Provident Corp., 107 Fed. Appx. 867 (10th Cir 2004).\n\nAward of attorney's fees was improperwhere the insurer's denial of a claim was not in bad faith, but was instead based upon evidence accumulated after a reasonable investigation.Suggs v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 833 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1007, 108 S. Ct. 1732, 100 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1988).\n\nInsurer's duty to investigate.— Beyond comparing the pleadings of the underlying litigation with the coverage provisions of the policy, an insurer did not have the duty of investigating third-party claims before making the determination whether to defend its insured. Valley ImprovementAss'n v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Corp., 129 F.3d 1108 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\nJury verdict supports award of fees.— Insured's entitlement to attorney's fees was established by the factual determinations implicit in the jury's award of punitive damages.O'Neel v. USAA Ins. Co., 2002-NMCA-028, 131 N.M. 630, 41 P.3d 356, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 737, 42 P.3d 842 (2002).\n\nDenial of attorney's fees not improper.— The trial court's refusal to award attorney's fees to an insured in a suit against her insurance company for the payment of proceeds was not error because the insurance company's denial of the claim for failure to comply with conditions precedent was both nonfrivolous and reasonable, even though the denial turned out ultimately to have been in error.Jackson Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. Receconi, 1992-NMSC-019, 113 N.M. 403, 827 P.2d 118.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 20 Am. Jur. 2d Costs § 63 et seq.; 44 Am. Jur. 2d Insurance § 1772; 46 Am.

      "text": "In any civil action involving liability for a deficiency pursuant to Section 55-9-504 or 58-19-7 NMSA 1978, the debtor, if prevailing, may in the discretion of the court be allowed a reasonable attorney fee set by the court and taxed and collected as costs.\n\nHistory:Laws 1981, ch. 10, § 3.\n\nAward of attorney fees allowed in actions arising from defaults on automobile purchase contracts.— In an action to recover a deficiency in a motor vehicle installment contract following the repossession and sale of the vehicle subject to the installment contract, where plaintiff filed the lawsuit more than four years after the defendant breached the installment contract, but where plaintiff argued that its complaint was timely because, pursuant to § 37-1-16 NMSA 1978, defendant's partial payments made after the initial breach tolled the four-year statute of limitations set forth in § 55-2-725 NMSA 1978, and where the district court held that the lawsuit was barred by the applicable four-year statute of limitations and awarded attorney fees to defendant, the district court did not err in awarding attorney fees because the plain language and purpose of this section indicate that the legislature intended to allow an award of attorney fees in deficiency actions arising from defaults on automobile purchase contracts.Autovest v. Agosto, 2021-NMCA-053, cert. granted.\n\nReplevin counterclaimwas not a civil action \"involving liability for a deficiency pursuant to Section 55-9-504\" for which the court could allow a reasonable attorney fee to the debtor.Green Tree Acceptance, Inc. v.

      "text": "In any civil action in the district court, small claims court or magistrate court to recover on an open account, the prevailing party may be allowed a reasonable attorney fee set by the court, and taxed and collected as costs.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 18-1-37, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 125, § 1; 1967, ch. 164, § 1; 1975, ch. 147, § 1; 1978 Comp., § 36-2-39, recompiled as 1978 Comp. § 39-2-2.1.\n\nRecompilations.— Former 36-2-39 NMSA 1978 was recompiled as this section pursuant to an order of the New Mexico compilation commission.\n\nSection was designed to prevent the threat of litigation as a tacticeither to avoid paying just debts or to enforce false claims.Cutter Flying Serv., Inc. v. Straughan Chevrolet, Inc., 1969-NMSC-132, 80 N.M. 646, 459 P.2d 350.\n\n\"Open account\" defined.— As used in this section, \"open account\" does not mean an amount owed on a single transaction or an account stated. It is a written account concerning a related series of debit and credit entries of reciprocal charges and allowances kept upon until it shall suit the convenience of either party to settle and close the account. It gives rise to a single liability determined at the time of settlement.S. Union Exploration Co. v. Wynn Exploration Co., 1981-NMCA-006, 95 N.M. 594, 624 P.2d 536, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 593, 624 P.2d 535 (1981), and cert. denied, 455 U.S. 920, 102 S. Ct. 1276, 71 L. Ed. 2d 461 (1982);Martinez v. Albuquerque Collection Servs., Inc., 867 F. Supp. 1495 (D.N.M. 1994).\n\nBreaking continuity of open account.— The continuity of an open account is broken if the relationship of the parties changes or if the account has remained dormant.Martinez v. Albuquerque Collection Servs., Inc., 867 F. Supp. 1495 (D.N.M. 1994).\n\n\"Account stated\" and \"open account\" distinguished.— Where the evidence shows a single transaction and that one party made a partial payment while acknowledging, in writing, the remaining amount owed, this is a finding of an \"account stated\" and not an \"open account,\" which requires evidence of a connected series of debit and credit entries or a continuation of a related series of transactions; therefore, attorney's fees are not recoverable under this section.Tabet Lumber Co. v. Chalamidas, 1971-NMCA-140, 83 N.M. 172, 489 P.2d 885,distinguished inHunt Process Co. v. Anderson, 455 F.2d 700 (10th Cir. 1972).\n\nNo attorney's fees for defending counterclaim on \"account stated\".— While this section clearly authorized attorney's fees to an attorney if he prevailed in his action on an open account, this section did not authorize attorney's fees for defending against counterclaims that were resolved on the basis of \"account stated\".Hinkle, Cox, Eaton, Coffield & Hensley v. Cadle Co. of Ohio, Inc., 1993-NMSC-010, 115 N.M. 152, 848 P.2d 1079.\n\nRetrospective application of section.— Because action was filed after the effective date of the statute, the statute applied to the parties only propspectively.Cutter Flying Serv., Inc., v. Straughan Chevrolet, Inc., 1969-NMSC-132, 80 N.M. 646, 459 P.2d 350.\n\nProfessional surveyor not entitled to attorney's fees.— A professional surveyor, hired to survey an entire ranch perimeter, to establish a new boundary on one side of the ranch and to survey an 80-acre parcel in one corner of the tract, entered into a single transaction composed of three parts and not an \"open account,\" which would involve a connected series of debit and credit entries or a series of related transactions, and, therefore, was not entitled to attorney's fees upon recovery of the amount owed him.Lujan v. Merhege, 1974-NMSC-014, 86 N.M. 26, 519 P.2d 122.\n\nSection is discretionary in nature,not mandatory, even assuming that the claim be one to recover on an open account.Audio-Visual Mktg. Corp. v. Omni Corp., 545 F.2d 715 (10th Cir. 1976).\n\nAwarding of an attorney's fee is a matter for the court,and not one to be resolved by a jury.Audio-Visual Mktg. Corp. v. Omni Corp., 545 F.2d 715 (10th Cir. 1976);Leon, Ltd. v. Carver, 1986-NMSC-015, 104 N.M. 29, 715 P.2d 1080.\n\nReasonableness of fee amount not questioned to trial court.— Where the question of reasonableness of the amount of attorney fees was not brought to the attention of the trial court, it cannot be raised on appeal.N.M. Feeding Co. v. Keck, 1981-NMSC-034, 95 N.M. 615, 624 P.2d 1012.\n\nSection allows fees on appeal.— This section allows reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party on appeal as well as at trial.Superior Concrete Pumping, Inc. v. David Montoya Constr., Inc., 1989-NMSC-023, 108 N.M. 401, 773 P.2d 346,overrulingOtis Engg'r Corp. v. Grace, 1974-NMSC-076, 86 N.M. 727, 527 P.2d 322, andSw. Portland Cement v.
