      "text": "The party in whose favor any judgment, order or decree in any court may be returned, shall have execution therefor in conformity to the order, judgment or decree. Said execution may be issued to the sheriff of any county of the state, and levy and sale made in any county wherein the judgment debtor may have property subject to execution.\n\nThe court where the judgment or decree was rendered shall have jurisdiction over all matters growing out of the levy or sale under any execution.\n\nHistory:Kearny Code, Executions, § 1; C.L. 1865, ch. 34, § 1; C.L. 1884, § 2157; C.L. 1897, § 3105; Code 1915, § 2190; Laws 1919, ch. 60, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 46-101; 1941 Comp., § 21-101; 1953 Comp., § 24-1-1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For provisions that execution not issue against county commissioner or municipality,seeN.M. Const., art. VIII, § 7.\n\nFor sheriff's fees for levy and sale,see4-41-16 and 4-41-17 NMSA 1978, respectively.\n\nFor levy to collect contributions due under Unemployment Compensation Law,see51-1-36 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor rule relating to stay of proceedings to enforce a judgment,seeRule 1-062 NMRA.\n\nFor rule relating to examination of judgment debtor or others,seeRule 1-069 NMRA.\n\nExclusive jurisdiction.— The jurisdiction clause at the end of the section vests exclusive jurisdiction over \"matters growing out of the levy or sale under any execution\" in the court rendering the judgment.Heimann v. Adee, 1996-NMSC-053, 122 N.M. 340, 924 P.2d 1352.\n\nEffect on equity powers of court.— This section, though giving execution for money decrees in equity, does not abrogate equity power to enforce by attachment as for contempt its decree for monthly payments for support of children.Ex parte Sedillo, 1929-NMSC-038, 34 N.M. 98, 278 P. 202.\n\nJudgment and execution for contract breach.— Where, after labor, material and money, sufficient to build a house, was voluntarily furnished, and the house was built on furnishee's lot, the furnishee and his wife, in consideration for such furnishing, verbally agreed with furnisher to board him for life, and, upon his death, to provide him a suitable burial, and, after the death of furnishee's wife, the furnishee breached the agreement, the furnisher was not entitled to equitable relief, but was entitled to remedy by judgment at law and execution thereon, or by attachment, or by judgment, execution and supplementary proceedings subsequent to execution.Van Sickle v. Keck, 1938-NMSC-041, 42 N.M. 450, 81 P.2d 707.\n\nSales by IRS distinguished.— Sales on execution or foreclosure are sales conducted under the auspices of the courts following entry of a judgment, order or decree, unlike sales under the Internal Revenue Code following administrative levy or seizure, which latter sales could not serve purchaser as basis of statutory action for forcible entry and detainer.Henderson v. Gibbany, 1966-NMSC-172, 76 N.M. 674, 417 P.2d 807.\n\nSheriff as agent of law.— The sheriff in execution of writs of execution is acting as an officer of, or as an agent of, the law, not necessarily as agent of the party who procures service of the writ, and in such capacity he is merely a nominal party.Riggs v. Gardikas, 1967-NMSC-120, 78 N.M. 5, 427 P.2d 890.\n\nOrder for sale modifiable.— Although, order for judicial sale may not initially be in accord with the statute, as an interlocutory order it may be modified, and is valid provided that the sale is conducted lawfully.Speckner v. Riebold, 1974-NMSC-029, 86 N.M. 275, 523 P.2d 10.\n\nDuties of sheriff.— Proceeding in aid of execution statutes, a sheriff must first reduce the property to possession, next he must advertise it for sale, then he must determine its value before sale and, in case exemption is claimed in lieu of homestead, he must not levy on such property to the amount of the exemption. 1944 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 44-4538.\n\nExecution out of supreme court.— When writ of execution issues out of supreme court the same procedure should be followed as when writ issues from the district court. 1944 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 44-4538.\n\nSection was not applicable to justice of peace courts(now magistrate courts) as former 36-6-9, 1953 Comp., the more specific statute, was controlling. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen.

The bracketed material was not enacted by the legislature and is not part of the law.\n\nProperty affected by execution.— The execution provided for in this section and 39-4-1 NMSA 1978 is one which may run against the property of the defendant generally, and is not one for the enforcement of liens upon specific property, such as mortgages and the like.Crowell v. Kopp, 1919-NMSC-065, 26 N.M. 146, 189 P. 652.\n\nLien not necessary.— The existence of a lien is not a prerequisite to a sheriff's levy and sale of real property.Heimann v. Adee, 1996-NMSC-053, 122 N.M. 340, 924 P.2d 1352.\n\nLiquor license.— As between the state and the licensee, a liquor license is a mere revocable privilege vesting no property rights in the licensee, but, as between the licensee and any other individual, such license is property and as such is subject to levy and sale under execution.Nelson v. Naranjo, 1964-NMSC-209, 74 N.M. 502, 395 P.2d 228.\n\nProcess by attachment as for contempt is not executionin contemplation of this section.In re Jaramillo, 1896-NMSC-023, 8 N.M. 598, 45 P. 1110.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part II,\" see 2 Nat.

      "text": "When any execution shall be placed in the hands of any officer for collection, he shall call upon the defendant for payment thereof, or to show him sufficient goods, chattels, effects and lands, whereof the same may be satisfied; and if the officer fail to find property sufficient to make the same he shall notify all persons who may be indebted to said defendant not to pay said defendant, but to appear before the court, out of which said execution issued, and make true answers, on oath, concerning his indebtedness, and the like proceedings shall be had as in cases of garnishees, summoned in suits originating by attachments.\n\nHistory:Kearny Code, Executions, § 3; C.L. 1865, ch. 34, § 3; C.L. 1884, § 2159; C.L. 1897, § 3107; Laws 1901, ch. 49, § 1; Code 1915, § 2192; C.S. 1929, § 46-103; 1941 Comp., § 21-103; 1953 Comp., § 24-1-3.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For taxing of bill of costs against defendant in execution,see39-2-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor garnishment,see35-12-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor attachment,see42-9-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor rule regarding proceedings supplementary to judgment,seeRule 1-069 NMRA.\n\nConstitutionality.— The part of the section allowing, in effect, a writ of garnishment to be signed by the sheriff is not unconstitutional, as process not signed and attested by the court clerk, as this notice is merely in aid of the execution in the hands of the sheriff, and has the effect of tying up any money the garnishee may owe the defendant.Hinds v. Velasquez, 1957-NMSC-092, 63 N.M. 282, 317 P.2d 899.\n\nNo implicit repeal.— Laws 1909, ch. 63 (former 26-2-1, 1953 Comp., et seq.), regarding garnishment, did not repeal the garnishment feature of this section.Hinds v. Velasquez, 1957-NMSC-092, 63 N.M. 282, 317 P.2d 899.\n\nProvisions not inconsistent.— There was no inconsistency between former general garnishment statute (26-2-1, 1953 Comp. et seq.) and that part of this section which is to be used in aid of execution.Hinds v. Velasquez, 1957-NMSC-092, 63 N.M. 282, 317 P.2d 899.\n\nStrict construction.— This section is in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed.Hinds v. Velasquez, 1957-NMSC-092, 63 N.M. 282, 317 P.2d 899.\n\nSection directory.— This section means that it is the duty of the sheriff to make demand for the payment of the debt upon the debtor, but it is directory.Inman v. Brown, 1955-NMSC-018, 59 N.M. 196, 281 P.2d 474.\n\nNo demand is contemplated where debtor is without sheriff's jurisdictionor otherwise so situated that a demand cannot readily be made upon him.Inman v. Brown, 1955-NMSC-018, 59 N.M. 196, 281 P.2d 474.\n\nNo demand is necessary where the debtor lives outside the jurisdiction of the sheriff, and no authorized agent of the debtor is known to the sheriff or can be ascertained with reasonable diligence.Pecos Valley Lumber Co. v. Friedenbloom, 1917-NMSC-067, 23 N.M. 383, 168 P. 497.\n\nNotice ineffectual.— A notice to trustee of notice of levy without notice to appear and answer execution is ineffectual.Citizens' Nat'l Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, 1924-NMSC-011, 29 N.M. 273, 222 P. 935.\n\nSale not invalid.— Where owner of a barber shop, fixtures of which were to be sold under execution, had left a man in charge whom he regarded as his agent, but who failed to act as agent and did not transmit to the owner notice of proposed sale, such facts did not invalidate the sale.Pecos Valley Lumber Co. v. Friedenbloom, 1917-NMSC-067, 23 N.M. 383, 168 P. 497.\n\nEffect of variance.— A variance between the amount of the execution and the amount of the judgment does not render the execution void, but voidable. It may be amended at any time, even on the return day, or after its return, to conform; and such variance is no defense to the action.Bachelder Bros. v. Chaves, 1891-NMSC-007, 5 N.M. 562, 25 P. 783.\n\nPrerequisites for jurisdiction in garnishment.— In garnishment proceedings, the plaintiff cannot subject the third party to the jurisdiction of the court unless he has complied with the statutory prerequisites.Garland v. Sperling Bros., 1892-NMSC-027, 6 N.M. 623, 30 P. 925,aff'd, 1893-NMSC-011, 7 N.M. 121, 32 P. 499.\n\nA district court does not have jurisdiction of an escrow fund allegedly held by a title company for the benefit of a defendant unless the record supports the conclusion that the title company was indebted to the defendants within the meaning of this section, and unless the sheriff first made demand on the judgment debtor.Title Guar. & Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 1987-NMCA-107, 106 N.M. 272, 742 P.2d 8.\n\nExisting and absolute debt essential.— In garnishment, in aid of execution, it is essential that the garnishee's debt to the judgment debtor be in existence at the time of the serving of the garnishment summons, absolutely and unconditionally owing and payable at the present or some future time.Garland v. Sperling Bros., 1892-NMSC-027, 6 N.M. 623, 30 P. 925,aff'd, 1893-NMSC-011, 7 N.M. 121, 32 P. 499.\n\nIssues in garnishment proceedings.— In garnishment proceedings by judgment creditor, under execution issued upon the judgment against a debtor of defendant, where garnishee's answer denied the indebtedness and denied fraud, the issue was not only as to the facts of indebtedness and fraud, but also as to the amount of indebtedness, and verdict that the answer was not true was a finding on only part of the issue, insufficient to support a judgment.Perea v. Colorado Nat'l Bank, 1891-NMSC-015, 6 N.M. 1, 27 P. 322.\n\nStatus of garnishee.— A garnishee stands, as nearly as possible, in the same position he would occupy if sued at law by his creditor.Field v. Sammis, 1903-NMSC-013, 12 N.M. 36, 73 P. 617.\n\nMeasure of garnishee's liability.— Garnishee's liability, legal and equitable, to the principal debtor is the measure of his liability.Field v. Sammis, 1903-NMSC-013, 12 N.M. 36, 73 P. 617.\n\nAnswer of garnishee was prima facie evidence of facts thereinset forth, so that burden of proof was on plaintiff, and evidence offered to controvert the answer presented an issue of fact for the jury; the court therefore erred in directing a verdict for the plaintiff.Perea v. Colorado Nat'l Bank, 1891-NMSC-015, 6 N.M. 1, 27 P. 322.\n\nMortgagee.— Mortgagee in possession, with right to buy if mortgagor did not pay by specified time, was not subject to garnishment, in aid of execution, at instance of mortgagor's judgment creditor.Garland v. Sperling Bros., 1892-NMSC-027, 6 N.M. 623, 30 P. 925,aff'd, 1893-NMSC-011, 7 N.M. 121, 32 P. 499.\n\nThird party may intervene in garnishment proceeding arising under execution,and set up rights legal or equitable, in the funds sought to be recovered.Field v. Sammis, 1903-NMSC-013, 12 N.M. 36, 73 P. 617.\n\nJudgment against garnishee void.— As there is no provision, whatever, allowing a court to render judgment against a garnishee for more than could be recovered against him by the principal debtor, and none for judgment solely because of default, it follows that judgment rendered against the garnishee because he failed to answer within the time required by law and not upon a showing of actual indebtedness owed by the garnishee to the defendant was void on the face of the record.Hinds v. Velasquez, 1957-NMSC-092, 63 N.M. 282, 317 P.2d 899.\n\nExemption.— The $500 exemption in lieu of homestead may be claimed out of current wages which have been garnished.McFadden v. Murray, 1927-NMSC-039, 32 N.M. 361, 257 P. 999.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 30 Am.

Const., art. IV, § 16, was without merit.Ballew v. Denson, 1958-NMSC-002, 63 N.M. 370, 320 P.2d 382.\n\nEnactment of procedure by reference valid.— Laws 1933, ch. 7 (39-4-13 to 39-4-16 NMSA 1978) does not contravene N.M. Const., art. IV, § 18 by attempting to revise, amend and extend substantive law by reference; the act grants an optional procedure for the enforcement of judgment liens, and procedural law may be adopted by reference.Ballew v. Denson, 1958-NMSC-002, 63 N.M. 370, 320 P.2d 382.\n\nJudgment lien on real estate is right established by statuteand did not exist at common law.Curtis Mfg. Co. v. Barela, 1966-NMSC-112, 76 N.M. 392, 415 P.2d 361.\n\nSubstantive and remedial rights.— Holder of a judgment lien on real estate has two or more rights, i.e., the right to the lien, which is a sort of substantive or property right, and a right to the remedies to enforce the lien.Pugh v. Heating & Plumbing Fin. Corp., 1945-NMSC-031, 49 N.M. 234, 161 P.2d 714.\n\nManner of conducting ordinary suits for mortgage foreclosures.— There are no statutes prescribing the manner in which ordinary suits for the foreclosure of mortgages are to be conducted, so the reference in this section to the manner of conducting such suits must be to the general practice in prosecuting all suits, both legal and equitable, under our Rules of Civil Procedure.Armstrong v. Csurilla, 1991-NMSC-081, 112 N.M. 579, 817 P.2d 1221.\n\nLien on equitable interest.— As neither this section nor 39-1-6 NMSA 1978 makes any distinction between legal and equitable interests in real estate, both sections allow a judgment lien to attach to an equitable interest.Mutual Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Collins, 1973-NMSC-113, 85 N.M. 706, 516 P.2d 677.\n\nBoth 39-1-6 NMSA 1978 and this section broadly refer to \"real estate\" of the judgment debtor and, therefore, are broad enough to include equitable interests within their purview.Marks v. City of Tucumcari, 1979-NMSC-045, 93 N.M. 4, 595 P.2d 1199.\n\nInterest retained by vendor under executory contract of sale is personaltyand not real estate.Marks v. City of Tucumcari, 1979-NMSC-045, 93 N.M. 4, 595 P.2d 1199.\n\nWife's moiety in community real property is subject to foreclosureunder a judgment lien against the wife arising from a tort during the marriage resulting from the negligent operation of a separately owned automobile.McDonald v. Senn, 1949-NMSC-020, 53 N.M. 198, 204 P.2d 990.\n\nJudgment lien and judgment.— Judgment lien and judgment, though related, are separate rights, and thus are separate causes of action.Curtis Mfg. Co. v. Barela, 1966-NMSC-112, 76 N.M. 392, 415 P.2d 361.\n\nCross claim to enforce a judgment lien.— Dismissal of a cross claim to enforce a judgment lien against real estate was not a bar to suit on the small claims court judgment, as the issue in the cross claim was the judgment lien and the small claims court judgment was not an issue therein.Curtis Mfg. Co. v. Barela, 1966-NMSC-112, 76 N.M. 392, 415 P.2d 361.\n\nIrregularities ratified by debtor.— Where debtor was in possession at the time and was personally served with process but allowed judgment to go against him by default, remaining in possession as tenant under lease from purchaser at special master's sale, the court did not lack jurisdiction because of alleged irregularities in judgment; as debtor made no objection to foreclosure proceedings and outstanding judgments against him were partially reduced from proceeds of sale, he was deemed to have ratified the allegedly irregular proceedings.Ballew v. Denson, 1958-NMSC-002, 63 N.M. 370, 320 P.2d 382.\n\nLien extinguished.— A judgment lien was extinguished and nonenforceable under a counterclaim in a suit to quiet title, where the time within which execution would normally issue on judgment lien had long expired and no steps for enforcement of the judgment had been taken.Pugh v. Heating & Plumbing Fin. Corp., 1945-NMSC-031, 49 N.M. 234, 161 P.2d 714.\n\nSales by Internal Revenue Service distinguished.— Sales on execution or foreclosure are sales conducted under the auspices of the courts following entry of a judgment, order or decree, unlike sales conducted by the Internal Revenue Service after levy and seizure.Henderson v. Gibbany, 1966-NMSC-172, 76 N.M. 674, 417 P.2d 807.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— Oil and gas royalty as real or personal property, 56 A.L.R.4th 539.\n\n49 C.J.S. Judgments § 502.",
