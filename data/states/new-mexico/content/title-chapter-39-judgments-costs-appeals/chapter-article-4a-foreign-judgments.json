      "heading": "Filing and status of foreign judgments.",
      "text": "A. A copy of any foreign judgment authenticated in accordance with an act of congress or the statutes of this state may be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court of any county of this state in which the judgment debtor resides or has any property or property rights subject to execution, foreclosure, attachment or garnishment. The clerk shall treat the foreign judgment in the same manner as a judgment of the district court of this state. A judgment so filed shall have the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses and proceedings for reopening, vacating, staying, enforcing or satisfying as a judgment of the district court of this state and may be enforced or satisfied in like manner, except as provided in Subsection B of this section.\n\nB. All property in this state of a judgment debtor is exempt from execution issuing from a foreign judgment filed pursuant to Subsection A of this section that is in favor of any state for failure to pay that state's income tax on benefits received from a pension or other retirement plan.\n\nHistory:Laws 1989, ch. 256, § 3; 1994, ch. 48, § 2.\n\nThe 1994 amendment,effective May 18, 1994, designated the previously undesignated language as Subsection A and added the exception clause at the end of the last sentence thereof; and added Subsection B.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 1994, ch. 48, § 3 makes the act applicable to judgments filed with a court in New Mexico on or after the effective date of the act.\n\nFull faith and credit not diminished.— The Foreign Judgments Act does not diminish the full faith and credit obligations due the final judgments of sister states.Conglis v. Radcliffe, 1995-NMSC-004, 119 N.M. 287, 889 P.2d 1209.\n\nForeign judgments must be given full faith and credit so long as they meet New Mexico procedural requirements.— Where a Nevada state court entered a judgment against defendants, and where, in the same year, plaintiff's predecessor in interest registered the Nevada judgment in California pursuant to California's Sister State Money Judgments Act, and where plaintiff was then assigned the rights to collect on the judgment by its predecessor in interest, and where, in July 2020, plaintiff renewed the California judgment in a California court, extending the enforceability of the judgment in California for an additional ten years, and, in November 2020, plaintiff brought a common law action to domesticate and enforce the California judgment in New Mexico district court, and where the district court determined that plaintiff could not domesticate and enforce a California state court judgment against defendant in New Mexico because the judgment was a ministerial registration of a Nevada state court money judgment and thus not entitled to full faith and credit in New Mexico, and that the original Nevada judgment expired and could not be registered in New Mexico, the district court erred in determining that plaintiff could not domesticate the California judgment, because foreign judgments registered in California are valid California judgments under New Mexico and California law, and New Mexico courts must give full faith and credit to them so long as they meet New Mexico procedural requirements; the California judgment is a valid and enforceable judgment in California, is not barred by New Mexico's statute of limitations, and is thus a valid and enforceable judgment in New Mexico.WV 23 Jumpstart, LLC v. Mynarcik, 2024-NMCA-027.\n\nRelief-from-judgment rule not applicable to foreign judgments.— New Mexico courts may not apply Rule 1-060 NMRA (relief from judgment or order) to foreign judgments in the same manner as the rule is applied to judgments of the courts of this state. The full faith and credit clause of the federal constitution limits the power of a court to reopen or vacate a foreign judgment, and foreign judgments cannot be collaterally attacked on the merits.Jordan v. Hall, 1993-NMCA-061, 115 N.M. 775, 858 P.2d 863.\n\nEntitlement to full faith and credit.— A foreign divorce decree and subsequent child support orders were entitled to full faith and credit.Thoma v. Thoma, 1997-NMCA-016, 123 N.M. 137, 934 P.2d 1066, cert. denied, 122 N.M. 808, 932 P.2d 498.\n\nCommunity property law.— New Mexico community property law controls enforcement of separate Arizona debt of a husband in New Mexico courts.Nat'l Bank of Arizona v. Moore, 2005-NMCA-122, 138 N.M. 496, 122 P.3d 1265, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-010, 138 N.M. 494, 122 P.3d 1263.\n\nChallenge of foreign judgment.— The Foreign Judgments Act permits a judgment debtor to challenge a foreign judgment on the basis of the lack of jurisdiction.Mueller v. Sample, 2004-NMCA-075, 135 N.M. 748, 93 P.3d 769.\n\nRevival of foreign judgment.— When a judgment by a federal bankruptcy court is domesticated in a district court in New Mexico, that court has jurisdiction to address and resolve issues concerning the judgment, including revival thereof; however, the district court lacks jurisdiction if the judgment has not been properly domesticated pursuant to this section.Walter E. Heller W., Inc. v. Ditto, 1998-NMCA-068, 125 N.M. 226, 959 P.2d 560, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 147, 958 P.2d 105.\n\nTexas judgment reached the assets of the decedent's estate in New Mexico.— Where plaintiff, who was a beneficiary of the decedent's testamentary trust, obtained a Texas judgment against defendant individually and as the executor of decedent's estate and trustee of decedent's testamentary trust; the judgment provided that the award to plaintiff exhausted plaintiff's rights to inherit from the estate; plaintiff domesticated the judgment in New Mexico and obtained a writ of execution to satisfy the judgment from property owned by the estate in New Mexico; and defendant claimed that because plaintiff sued defendant for malfeasance, defendant was personally liable to plaintiff and the judgment did not lie against the estate, the judgment lay against the estate, trust and defendant personally and reached assets owned by the estate in New Mexico.Williams v. Crutcher, 2013-NMCA-044, 298 P.3d 1184.",

The notice shall include the name and address of the judgment creditor and his attorney, if any, in this state. In addition, the judgment creditor shall mail a notice of the filing of the judgment to the judgment debtor, certified mail, and shall file proof of the mailing with the clerk.\n\nC.

If the judgment debtor shows the district court sufficient grounds upon which enforcement of a judgment of any district court of this state would be stayed, the court shall stay enforcement of the foreign judgment for an appropriate period, upon requiring the same security for satisfaction that is required in this state.\n\nHistory:Laws 1989, ch. 256, § 5.",
