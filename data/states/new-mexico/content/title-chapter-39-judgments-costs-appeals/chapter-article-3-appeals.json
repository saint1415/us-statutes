      "text": "All appeals from inferior tribunals to the district courts shall be tried anew in said courts on their merits, as if no trial had been had below, except as otherwise provided by law.\n\nHistory:Laws 1917, ch. 43, § 59; C.S. 1929, § 105-2533; 1941 Comp., § 19-1001; 1953 Comp., § 21-10-1; Laws 1955, ch. 68, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For costs on appeal,see39-2-5 and 39-2-6 NMSA 1978, and Rule 12-403 NMRA.\n\nFor free process on indigent appeals,see39-3-12 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor constitutional provision as to appeals from probate courts and other inferior courts,seeN.M.

If an appeal is on record, the district court acts as a typical appellate court reviewing the record of the lower court's trial for legal error. In a de novo appeal, in contrast to appeals on the record, the district court conducts a new trial as if the trial in the lower court had not occurred.State v. Foster, 2003-NMCA-099, 134 N.M. 224, 75 P.3d 824, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 179, 74 P.3d 1071 (2003).\n\nAppeal of guilty plea.— A defendant is not entitled, as a matter of right, to a trial de novo in district court following judgment against him on his guilty plea and disposition agreement in the metropolitan court.State v. Bazan, 97 N.M. 531, 641 P.2d 1078 (Ct. App.), cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039 (1982),overruled in part by State v. Ball, 104 N.M. 176, 718 P.2d 686 (1986)\n\nDistrict court erred in dismissing defendant's de novo appeal.— Where defendant was charged with criminal damage to property of a household member, and where, at arraignment in magistrate court, defendant asked to be represented by a public defender, and where the magistrate court judge entered an order conditionally appointing the Law Offices of the Public Defender (LOPD), finding that \"the defendant was unable to obtain counsel and desires representation by the LOPD\", and where, in that same proceeding while defendant stood accused of a crime and had requested but had not yet received legal representation, the magistrate court judge accepted defendant's plea of no contest and adjudicated defendant's guilt, and where on de novo appeal to the district court, the district court judge dismissed the appeal for lack of prosecution, finding that defendant had not taken action on the case in more than 180 days, the district court erred in dismissing defendant's de novo appeal, because the district court effectively shifted the burden on defendant to bring himself to trial. While a defendant has the burden to file a de novo appeal according to applicable rules of procedure, the defendant does not have the burden to move the case forward thereafter.State v. Cruz, 2021-NMSC-015,rev'gA-1-CA-37581, mem. op. (May 24, 2019) (non-precedential).\n\nCounty in which appeal should be heard.— An appeal of hearing officer's decision for bids for a campus electrical distribution upgrade project must be taken in the district court of the county in which the agency maintains its principal office or the district court of any county in which a hearing on the matter was conducted. Use of the word \"may\" in Section 39-3-1.1C NMSA 1978 does not permit an administrative appeal to be brought in any district court. The appeal itself is permissive and not mandatory.State ex rel ENMU Regents v. Baca, 2008-NMSC-047, 144 N.M. 530, 189 P.3d 663.\n\nAppeal premature.— The petitioner's appeal of the human services department's [health care authority department's] administrative decision establishing a claim for overpayment of food stamp benefits was premature where the department failed to exercise its authority under federal law to settle, adjust, or compromise the department's overpayment claim.Waters-Haskins v. N.M. Human Services Dept., 2008-NMCA-127, 144 N.M. 853, 192 P.3d 1230, cert. granted, 2008-NMCERT-009, 145 N.M. 257, 196 P.3d 488,rev'd, 2009-NMSC-031, 146 N.M. 391, 210 P.3d 817.\n\nDistrict court must try case de novo.— District court, in prosecution for assault and battery, must try the case de novo, as other criminal cases.Territory v. Lowitski, 6 N.M. 235, 27 P. 496 (1891) (decided under former law).\n\nWhere appellant interposed a plea to the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace (now magistrate), which was overruled, and he declined to plead further and judgment was rendered against him, and on appeal to the district court appellant conceded the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace but appellee's motion for affirmance of the judgment was overruled, the latter ruling was proper because the case is triable de novo in the district court, upon the merits, under our statute.Rogers v. Kemp Lumber Co., 18 N.M. 300, 137 P. 586 (1913) (decided under former law).\n\nTrial de novo is trial \"anew,\"as if no trial whatever had been had in the municipal court.City of Farmington v. Sandoval, 90 N.M. 246, 561 P.2d 945 (Ct. App. 1977).\n\nDistrict court does not review correctness of proceedings in municipal court;the district court trial is as if no trial had been held in the municipal court.City of Farmington v. Sandoval, 90 N.M. 246, 561 P.2d 945 (Ct. App. 1977).\n\nIn an appeal from the magistrate court, the district court's review is not for legal error.— Where defendant was charged in magistrate court with one misdemeanor traffic violation and three petty misdemeanor violations, and where, two days before trial, defendant requested copies of jury questionnaires from the magistrate court clerk, who informed defendant that the magistrate court required a copying fee for copies of the jury questionnaires, and where, the day before trial, defendant filed a verified application for free process for indigency, along with a motion to continue his trial, and where, the next morning, with the jury panel already in the courtroom for jury selection, the magistrate court orally denied defendant's motion to continue, and where, following a jury trial, defendant was convicted on all four counts, and where defendant appealed to the district court and filed a pretrial motion requesting appellate review of the magistrate court clerk's refusal to provide him free copies of the jury questionnaires and of the magistrate court's denial of his motion to continue, and where the district court denied defendant's pretrial motion and held a de novo jury trial, after which, defendant was again convicted on all four counts, and where, on appeal, defendant claimed that the district court should have remanded his case to the magistrate court for a new trial, the district court did not err in providing defendant with a trial de novo, because the district court's review in an appeal from the magistrate court is not for legal error. Defendant's claims of error can only be remedied by a trial de novo in the district court, and no rule permits the district court to remand or otherwise transfer jurisdiction back to the magistrate court for a new trial.State v. Lucero, 2022-NMCA-020, cert. denied.\n\nTrial de novo on alternative means of committing offense did not violate double jeopardy.— When a defendant is convicted based on one of two alternative means of committing a single crime, there is not an implied acquittal of the other alternative unless the conviction logically excludes guilt of the other alternative; if there is no implied acquittal, there is no constitutional prohibition against retrial of both alternatives after a conviction is set aside.State v. Ben, 2015-NMCA-118, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-011.\n\nWhere defendant was charged in magistrate court with multiple means of committing DWI, per se DWI and impaired to the slightest degree, and was convicted on the per se theory of DWI, defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated when he was retried de novo on the impaired theory in the district court, because his conviction on the per se theory of DWI was not logically inconsistent with a finding of impaired DWI.State v. Ben, 2015-NMCA-118, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-011.\n\nAgency's interpretation of intellectual disability and related condition was reasonable.— Where applicant, a young man diagnosed with cervical spina bifida, was screened for admission to plaintiff's nursing facility pursuant to a preadmission screening and annual resident review program (PASARR), which is required by federal and New Mexico regulations to identify individuals with mental illness or intellectual disability applying to and residing in medicaid-certified nursing facilities, and where plaintiff decided not to forward applicant's level I screening for a level II screening despite applicant's spina bifida diagnosis, based on a determination that applicant did not have an impairment of intellectual functioning similar to those of intellectually disabled persons, and where the New Mexico human services department (HSD) [health care authority department] initiated a recoupment action against the nursing facility to recover the medicaid funds the nursing facility received for care of applicant to which plaintiff was not entitled because it failed to comply with the PASARR screening regulations, which required it to initiate a level II screening prior to applicant's admission, and where the district court upheld the agency recoupment action, finding that plaintiff breached its duty to report applicant's condition to the department of health, and where the New Mexico court of appeals reversed the district court, finding that the screening forms and instructions did not have the force and effect of law and cannot serve as the basis for an HSD enforcement action, the New Mexico supreme court held that the court of appeals was correct in determining that the level I screening form and instructions were interpretive rules and not legislative rules, but erred in holding that plaintiff did not violate the law by determining applicant did not have an intellectual disability and declining to initiate a level II screening, because that determination is the sole province of the state mental health and intellectual disability authority.Princeton Place v. N.M. Hum. Servs. Dep't, 2022-NMSC-005,rev'g2018-NMCA-036, 419 P.3d 194.\n\nReview of Medicaid recoupment action.— Where petitioner, a nursing home, appealed the district court's decision upholding the decision of the director of the New Mexico Human services department [health care authority department], medical assistance division, (HSD/MAD) to recoup medicaid payments made to petitioner on the basis that petitioner was not entitled to medicaid payments for services to a certain resident because petitioner did not comply with New Mexico department of health (DOH) nursing home preadmission screening regulations before it admitted the resident, the district court erred in determining that petitioner improperly performed or otherwise failed to complete the screening process, because petitioner's admission coordinator correctly completed the screening form provided by DOH and, because the screening form and instructions provided by DOH were not promulgated according to the New Mexico Administrative Procedures Act, they do not have the force and effect of law and cannot serve as the basis for a HSD/MAD enforcement action.Princeton Place v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 2018-NMCA-036, cert. granted.\n\nLate filing of appeal.— Because timely filing of an appeal is a mandatory precondition rather than an absolute jurisdictional requirement, a trial court may, under unusual circumstances, use its discretion and entertain an appeal even though it is not timely filed. The decision to dismiss an appeal is extreme and must be determined on a case-by-case basis.Trujillo v. Serrano, 117 N.M. 273, 871 P.2d 369 (1994).\n\nCourt error may excuse late appeal.— One unusual circumstance that would warrant permitting an untimely appeal is if the delay is a result of judicial error. To deny a party the constitutional right to an appeal because of a mistake on the part of the court runs against the most basic precepts of justice and fairness.Trujillo v. Serrano, 117 N.M. 273, 871 P.2d 369 (1994).\n\nDistrict court not to review probate court determination on certiorari.— The district court is in error in reviewing the probate court's determination on writ of certiorari as certiorari is available only if the probate court lacked jurisdiction in the case or if no right of appeal existed.Jones v. Seaton, 80 N.M. 210, 453 P.2d 380 (1969).\n\nEven if determination erroneous.— The determination of the intention of the testator, even though erroneous, does not oust the probate judge of jurisdiction. The remedy for a claimed error is by appeal, not by certiorari.Jones v. Seaton, 80 N.M. 210, 453 P.2d 380 (1969).\n\nDistrict court not to take jurisdiction unless inferior court had same.— District court cannot, on appeal, take jurisdiction, except for purpose of dismissal, unless the inferior court had acquired jurisdiction.Chaves v. Perea, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 89, 2 P. 73 (1884) (decided under former law).\n\nAppeal held not to operate as stay of execution.— The taking of an appeal or suing out a writ of error does not operate as a stay of execution, and a judgment plaintiff has a right to issue execution upon such judgment, or take such other proceedings as the law contemplates, in the absence of a supersedeas bond approved and filed in accordance with law.Llewellyn v. First State Bank, 22 N.M. 358, 161 P. 1185 (1916) (decided under former law).\n\nState has no right to appeal from judgmentof the district court sustaining in part a demurrer (now motion to dismiss) to an information charging defendant with trespassing on a school section.State v. Dallas, 22 N.M. 392, 163 P. 252 (1917).\n\nThere is no statutory authority authorizing an appeal by the state from a judgment sustaining a plea in abatement to an indictment.Ex parte Carrillo, 22 N.M. 149, 158 P. 800 (1916) (decided under former law).\n\nDistrict court controlled by rules of practice.— Appeals from inferior tribunals to the district court must be tried upon their merits as if they were new actions in such court, which is not to be trammeled in its mode of proceeding by the irregular, untechnical acts of the justice of the peace (now magistrate), but the proceedings are to be controlled by its enlarged rules of practice which permit amendments to show jurisdiction of such justice of the peace.Sanchez y Contreas v. Candelaria, 5 N.M. 400, 23 P. 239 (1890) (decided under former law).\n\nAmendment of complaint on appeal permitted.— On appeal from a justice of the peace (now magistrate), the district court may permit an amendment to the complaint to remedy deficiencies in the justice court, and it is error to refuse such amendment. Romero v. Luna, 6 N.M. 440, 30 P. 855 (1892);Sanchez y Contreas v. Candelaria, 5 N.M. 400, 23 P. 239 (1890) (decided under former law).\n\nRight of appeal governed by statute when judgment rendered.— As a general rule, the right of appeal is governed by the statute in force when final judgment is rendered, and, unless the statute which changes the right of appeal clearly intends a retrospective effect, it has no application to causes in which final judgment was rendered prior to its passage.Jackman v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry., 22 N.M. 422, 163 P. 1084 (1917).\n\nComputation of time for taking appeal.— The time for taking an appeal or writ of error is computed from the date of the denial of the motion for new trial and not from the date of the entry of judgment, the motion for a new trial having been filed within the specified time.Romero v. McIntosh, 19 N.M. 612, 145 P. 254 (1914) (decided under former law).\n\nDelay in conducting appeal de novo.— A delay in conducting an appeal de novo in district court following a conviction in municipal court did not establish a deprivation of the defendant's constitutional rights since the defendant had a responsibility to try to keep the case from slipping through the cracks.Town of Bernalillo v. Garcia, 118 N.M. 610, 884 P.2d 501 (Ct. App.), cert. denied, 118 N.M. 585, 883 P.2d 1282 (1994).\n\nOrganic Act prohibited appeals other than from final judgments.— The Organic Act, establishing the territory of New Mexico, prohibited the entertaining of appeals from any class of decisions other than final judgments.Weaver v. Weaver, 15 N.M. 333, 107 P. 527 (1910) (decided under former law).\n\nJudgment vacating previous voidable judgment as final.— A judgment of a district court purporting to vacate a previous judgment which was voidable, but not void, is a final judgment and appealable.Weaver v. Weaver, 16 N.M. 98, 113 P. 599 (1911) (decided under former law).\n\nViolation of injunction as final judgment.— Appeals do not lie to the supreme court from judgments of district courts which commit persons to jail for the willful violation of an injunction, for this statute only confers jurisdiction to review by appeal final judgments rendered upon indictments in criminal cases.Marinan v. Baker, 12 N.M. 451, 78 P. 531 (1904) (decided under former law).\n\nFiduciaries are entitled to supersede judgmentagainst them, as such, only when they have sued out an appeal or writ of error within 60 days from the date of final judgment.Sakariason v. Mechem, 20 N.M. 307, 149 P. 352 (1915) (decided under former law).\n\nAppeal of contested election.— The district court had appellate jurisdiction from judgments and orders of the prefects and alcaldes in all cases not prohibited by law, including contested election cases for justice of the peace (now magistrate).Quintana v. Tompkins, 1 N.M. 29 (1853),overruled Arellano v. Chacon, 1 N.M. 269 (1859), holding that no appeal lie from probate court judgment in case of contested election for office of justice of the peace (decided under former law).\n\nAppeals from probate court.— Appeals may be taken from judgments relating to revenue of probate courts, in which the causes originated, to the district and not to the supreme court, provided they are taken on the day of trial; so that the district and not the supreme court is by law the appropriate appellate tribunal from the judgment of the probate court.Territory v. Ortiz, 1 N.M. 5 (1852) (decided under former law).\n\nWhere judgment of probate court is not final,but merely an interlocutory order, it is error to compel an appeal to the district court by mandamus.Territory ex rel. Lee v. Hubbell, 9 N.M. 560, 58 P. 344 (1899) (decided under former law).\n\nTo allow interlocutory appeal of order of suppression from magistrate courtwould impermissibly expand the appellate jurisdiction of the district court to hear matters beyond those currently allowed.State v. Heinsen, 2004-NMCA-110, 136 N.M. 295, 97 P.3d 627,aff'd2005-NMSC-035, 138 N.M. 441, 121 P.3d 1040.\n\nThe state does not have the statutory authority or constitutional right to immediately appeal a magistrate court order suppressing evidence to the district court.State v. Heinsen, 2004-NMCA-110, 136 N.M. 295, 97 P.3d 627,aff'd2005-NMSC-035, 138 N.M. 441, 121 P.3d 1040.\n\nAction outside scope of district court's appellate jurisdiction.— Where in a de novo motion hearing the district court took testimony of the same witnesses heard in the magistrate court, entered specific findings concerning those witnesses' credibility, reversed the magistrate's order and remanded the case to the magistrate for trial, this action is clearly outside the scope of the district court's appellate jurisdiction, which only provides an appeal by a full trial de novo as if the trial below had not happened in the magistrate court.State v. Heinsen, 2004-NMCA-110, 136 N.M. 295, 97 P.3d 627,aff'd2005-NMSC-035, 138 N.M. 441, 121 P.3d 1040.\n\nAppeal from hearing officer's decision.— \"Inferior tribunals,\" as used in this section, does not include a county personnel board or hearing officer; county was not entitled to de novo review of an adverse personnel decision by a hearing officer.Bd. of Cnty.

      "heading": "Appeal of final decisions by agencies to district court; application; scope of review; review of district court decisions.",
      "text": "A. The provisions of this section shall apply only to judicial review of agency final decisions that are placed under the authority of this section by specific statutory reference.\n\nB. Upon issuing a final decision, an agency shall promptly:\n\n(1) prepare a written decision that includes an order granting or denying relief and a statement of the factual and legal basis for the order;\n\n(2) file the written decision with the official public records of the agency; and\n\n(3) serve a document that includes a copy of the written decision and the requirements for filing an appeal of the final decision on:\n\n(a) all persons who were parties in the proceeding before the agency; and\n\n(b) every person who has filed a written request for notice of the final decision in that particular proceeding.\n\nC. Unless standing is further limited by a specific statute, a person aggrieved by a final decision may appeal the decision to district court by filing in district court a notice of appeal within thirty days of the date of filing of the final decision. The appeal may be taken to the district court for the county in which the agency maintains its principal office or the district court of any county in which a hearing on the matter was conducted. When notices of appeal from a final decision are filed in more than one district court, all appeals not filed in the district court in which the first appeal was properly filed shall be dismissed without prejudice. An appellant whose appeal was dismissed without prejudice pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall have fifteen days after receiving service of the notice of dismissal to file a notice of appeal in the district court in which the first appeal was properly filed.\n\nD. In a proceeding for judicial review of a final decision by an agency, the district court may set aside, reverse or remand the final decision if it determines that:\n\n(1) the agency acted fraudulently, arbitrarily or capriciously;\n\n(2) the final decision was not supported by substantial evidence; or\n\n(3) the agency did not act in accordance with law.\n\nE. A party to the appeal to district court may seek review of the district court decision by filing a petition for writ of certiorari with the court of appeals, which may exercise its discretion whether to grant review. A party may seek further review by filing a petition for writ of certiorari with the supreme court.\n\nF. The district court may certify to the court of appeals a final decision appealed to the district court, but undecided by that court, if the appeal involves an issue of substantial public interest that should be decided by the court of appeals. The appeal shall then be decided by the court of appeals.\n\nG. The procedures governing appeals and petitions for writ of certiorari that may be filed pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be set forth in rules adopted by the supreme court.\n\nH. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"agency\" means any state or local public body or officer placed under the authority of this section by specific statutory reference;\n\n(2) \"final decision\" means an agency ruling that as a practical matter resolves all issues arising from a dispute within the jurisdiction of the agency, once all administrative remedies available within the agency have been exhausted. The determination of whether there is a final decision by an agency shall be governed by the law regarding the finality of decisions by district courts. \"Final decision\" does not mean a decision by an agency on a rule, as defined in the State Rules Act [Chapter 14, Article 4 NMSA 1978]; and\n\n(3) \"hearing on the matter\" means a formal proceeding conducted by an agency or its hearing officer for the purpose of taking evidence or hearing argument concerning the dispute resolved by the final decision.\n\nHistory:Laws 1998, ch. 55, § 1; 1999, ch. 265, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For appeals

for \"all parties whose rights are adjudged by the final decision; and\", added Subsection F, and redesignated the subsequent subsections accordingly.\n\nMeaning of the word \"may\".— The use of the word \"may\" in Subsection C of Section 39-1-1.1 NMSA 1978 does not permit an administrative appeal to be brought in any district court. It means that the appeal itself is permissive and not mandatory.State ex rel. ENMU Regents v. Baca, 2008-NMSC-047, 144 M.M. 530, 189 P.3d 663.\n\nRequirements of written decision.— Section 39-3-1.1 NMSA 1978, at least as it applies to legislative bodies, plainly requires a document that adequately informs the affected parties of the action of the policymaking body and alerts the parties that they may proceed with an appeal of the legislative order. Village resolutions were officially adopted at public meetings after a lengthy and public process mandated by the Improvement Districts Act. Each contained an order in the form of resolutions, and each contained both facts and law. The resolutions cited Sections 3-33-1 through -43 NMSA 1978 as legal authority for deciding the resolution, and included facts such as the approximate cost of the project and the names of the engineers who completed the study. They outlined the procedure that the village followed in arriving at the resolutions. They also contained a statement confirming that the village council examined the plans, costs, and plat, and accepted them. It incorporated those plans in the resolution, noting that the plans were available for public examination. They included information about the village's consideration of all protests, including a finding that some were without merit while others had merit, and its confirmation of the revised assessment roll, noting that the roll was available for public examination. Both resolutions included written notification of a right to appeal the decisions therein to the district court. This is sufficient to meet the requirements of Section 39-3-1.1B(1) NMSA 1978.Angel Fire v. Wheeler, 2003-NMCA-041, 133 N.M. 421, 63 P.3d 524, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 413, 63 P.3d 516.\n\nFactual and legal basis of decision required.— The district court exercising appellate jurisdiction under Section 39-1-1.1 NMSA 1978 is not a fact-determining body. Where a governing body is required by statute to provide a written factual and legal basis for its decision, and a decision turnson factual questions that the governing body failed to resolve, the district court must remand for further proceedings. VanderVossen v. City of Espanola, 2001-NMCA-016, 130 N.M. 287, 24 P.3d 319, cert. quashed, 131 N.M. 221, 34 P.3d 610.\n\nWritten basis for decision not required.— Even though statute does not explicitly state that the commission must provide a written factual and legal basis for its decision, administrative agencies must provide written factual and legal basis for their decisions in order to permit an effectual and meaningful review.Gila Res. Info. Project v. N.M. Water Quality Comm'n, 2005-NMCA-139, 138 N.M. 625, 124 P.3d 1164, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-009, 138 N.M. 439, 120 P.3d 1182.\n\nConstitutionality.— Subsection E, vesting the court of appeals with discretionary review authority of appeals to district court does not violate Article 6, Section 2 of the New Mexico constitution, because that section only applies to appeals of a district court's original jurisdiction cases and not to review of the district court acting in an appellate capacity.VanderVossen v. City of Espanola, 2001-NMCA-016, 130 N.M. 287, 24 P.3d 319, cert. quashed, 131 N.M. 221, 34 P.3d 610.\n\nIssue is one of \"substantial public interest\"when it raises a question of first impression that is likely to recur, and when the need for uniformity is great.Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rio Arriba County Assessor, 2004-NMCA-055, 135 N.M. 630, 92 P.3d 642, rev'd on other grounds, 2004-NMSC-035, 136 N.M. 630, 103 P.3d 554.\n\nRule 12-505 A(1) NMRA is consistent with language in this sectionthat directs review of district court decisions by an appellate court.Dixon v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2004-NMCA-044, 135 N.M. 431, 89 P.3d 680.\n\nRule 12-505 NMRA governs procedure by which aggrieved party may seek reviewin the court of appeals of a district court's determination based on a Rule 1-074 NMRA appeal authorized by this section.Dixon v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2004-NMCA-044, 135 N.M. 431, 89 P.3d 680.\n\nSections 66-8-112 and 66-5-35 NMSA 1978 are not read to preclude application of this section;on the contrary, they can be read together harmoniously with 66-5-36 NMSA 1978 to effect the legislature's intent to standardize the method for obtaining judicial review of final decisions of certain administrative agencies.Dixon v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2004-NMCA-044, 135 N.M. 431, 89 P.3d 680.\n\nStandard of review for court of appeals.— After the enactment of this section, the standard of review for the court of appeals upon the review of a district court decision of an appeal from an administrative agency is based upon the criteria for a writ of certiorari as outlined in Rule 12-505 NMRA, and no longer may the court of appeals review the district court decision under the administrative standard.C.F.T. Dev., LLC v. Board of County Comm'rs, 2001-NMCA-069, 130 N.M. 775, 32 P.3d 784,overruled on other grounds byRio Grand Chapter of Sierra Club v. N.M. Mining Comm'n, 2003-NMSC-005, 113 N.M. 97, 61 P.3d 806.\n\nInsurance company's decision to deny coverage was supported by substantial evidence.— Where respondent's daughter suffered a severely disabling anoxic brain injury which resulted from an incident of cardiac arrest and stroke, and where the insurance company denied coverage for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), the district court erred in reversing the insurance company's decision because the HBOT treatments were not only specifically not covered treatments under the health plan into which the insurance company and respondent contracted, they were specifically excluded, and because substantial evidence supported the insurance company's determination that the HBOT treatments were not medically necessary to treat the medical condition under the Insurance Code, based on a lack of evidence that HBOT improved the injury and the lack of evidence establishing a causal linkage between any alleged improvements of the injury and HBOT treatment.Rodarte v. Presbyterian Ins. Co., 2016-NMCA-051, cert. denied.\n\nStandard of review for district courts.— District court exceeded the limited review that characterized an administrative appeal by entertaining an issue that had not been raised below.N.M. State Bd. of Psychologist Exam'rs v. Land, 2003-NMCA-034, 133 N.M. 362, 62 P.3d 1244, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 413, 63 P.3d 516.\n\nDistrict court acted outside its capacity as an appellate court by engaging in fact-finding when it determined, contrary to the determination of the county board of commissioners, that the administrative record supported a conclusion that a landfill was in a critical area as defined in the county ground water policy.Cadena v. Bernalillo Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 2006-NMCA-036, 139 N.M. 300, 131 P.3d 687.\n\nProceedings prior to effective date of section.— Final district court orders following appeals of decisions of administrative agencies were entered after the effective dates of this section and Rule 12-505 NMRA. Therefore, cases before the court of appeals for review were not \"pending\" cases within the meaning of N.M. const., art. IV, § 34.Hyden v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 2000-NMCA-002, 128 N.M. 423, 993 P.2d 740.\n\nTime for filing notice of appeal.— Even though appellants failed to comply with the 20-day time limit imposed by Rule 12-505 NMRA for seeking review on certiorari, extensions were granted where they were sought because of confusion surrounding the enactment and publication of the rule.Hyden v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 2000-NMCA-002, 128 N.M. 423, 993 P.2d 740.\n\nTolling of time to appeal.— Where the developer sought review in federal court of the municipality's denial of the developer's preliminary plat within twenty-eight days after the municipality issued its final decision; while the developer's federal action was pending, the municipality filed an action in state district court to quiet title to the land; and after the federal court dismissed the federal action, the developer timely filed a counterclaim against the municipality in the state district court action to review the municipality's action denying the preliminary plat, the federal action tolled the limitations period to appeal and the developer's appeal for review in state district court was timely.City of Rio Rancho v. Amrep Sw., Inc., 2011-NMSC-037, 150 N.M. 428, 260 P.3d 414,aff'g in part,rev'g in part,2010-NMCA-075, 148 N.M. 542, 238 P.3d 911.\n\nSubsection C details appeal process to the district court.Paule v. Santa Fe County, 2005-NMSC-021, 138 N.M.82, 117 P.3d 240.\n\nA county's approval or disapproval of a preliminary plat is a final, appealable decision for purposes of Section 47-6-15 NMSA 1978.Zuni Indian Tribe v. McKinley Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 2013-NMCA-041, 300 P.3d 133.\n\nA county's decision on a preliminary plat is appealable.— Where the county disapproved the applicant's preliminary plat in the form of a written resolution which incorporated the final findings and recommendations of the county planning commission; the resolution followed input by state agencies and other interested parties and public hearings before the planning commission; interested parties submitted proposed findings and recommendations after the hearings; and the findings and recommendations adopted by the county commission included important aspects of the subdivision development and review process, such as water availability, waste disposal and access, given the nature of the county commission's resolution and the procedural history that preceded its passage, the county commission's resolution constituted a \"decision\" under Section 47-6-15 NMSA 1978 and was appealable.Zuni Indian Tribe v. McKinley Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 2013-NMCA-041, 300 P.3d 133.\n\nA timely filed appeal from a decision on a preliminary plat application is not rendered mootby the county's decision to approve the final subdivision plat application during the pendency of the appeal.Zuni Indian Tribe v. McKinley Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 2013-NMCA-041, 300 P.3d 133.\n\nTime for filing notice of appeal.— The time for filing an administrative appeal to the district court under Subsection B of this section begins to run on the date the final decision or order is filed.Paule v. Santa Fe County, 2005-NMSC-021, 138 N.M. 82, 117 P.3d 240.\n\nFinal decision.— A \"final decision\" for purposes of this section is an agency ruling that as a practical matter resolves all issues arising from a dispute within the jurisdiction of the agency.Paule v. Santa Fe County, 2005-NMSC-021, 138 N.M. 82, 117 P.3d 240.\n\nDecision revoking license or denying limited license.— A party should file a petition for certiorari when that party is seeking review in the Court of Appeals of a district court's determination on appeal from a motor vehicles division decision revoking a license or denying a limited license.Dixon v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2004-NMCA-044, 135 N.M. 431, 89 P.3d 680.\n\nRule 1-074 NMRA review in license revocation and denial of limited license cases is authorized by this section.Dixon v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2004-NMCA-044, 135 N.M. 431, 89 P.3d 680.\n\nAppeals from motor vehicles division hearings.— The legislature has designated the district court as the exclusive forum for appeals from motor vehicles division hearings.Maso v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2004-NMCA-025, 135 N.M. 152, 85 P.3d 276, aff'd., 2004-NMSC-028, 136 N.M. 161, 96 P.3d 286.\n\nSpecial use permit.— Where plaintiff properly sought a special use permit, it was reasonable for her to attempt an administrative resolution before proceeding to court, and a review pursuant to this section and Rule 1-074 NMRA would have been limited to the narrow matter of the special use permit.Takhar v. Town of Taos, 2004-NMCA-072, 135 N.M. 741, 93 P.3d 762, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-006, 135 N.M. 788, 93 P.3d 1292.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Jurisdiction as May Be Provided by Law: Some Issues at Appellate Jurisdiction in New Mexico,\" see 36 N.M.L.

      "text": "Within thirty days from the entry of any final judgment or decision, any interlocutory order or decision which practically disposes of the merits of the action, or any final order after entry of judgment which affects substantial rights, in any civil action in the district court, any party aggrieved may appeal therefrom to the supreme court or to the court of appeals, as appellate jurisdiction may be vested by law in these courts.\n\nHistory:Laws 1917, ch. 43, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 105-2501; 1953 Comp., § 21-10-2; Laws 1966, ch. 28, § 35.\n\nCross references.— For supreme court jurisdiction,seeN.M. Const., art. VI, § 2; 39-3-3, 39-3-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor court of appeals jurisdiction,seeN.M. Const., art. VI, § 29; 39-5-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act,seeChapter 39, Article 7 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor when appeals taken,seeRules 12-201 and 12-203 NMRA.\n\nFor how appeals taken,seeRule 12-202 NMRA.\n\nFor procedure on certiorari to review decision of court of appeals,seeRule 12-502 NMRA.\n\nFor procedure on certification from court of appeals,seeRule 12-606 NMRA.\n\nProvisions not applicable to election contests.— Laws 1917, ch. 43, § 1 (this section), § 2 (39-3-15 NMSA 1978), and § 4 (39-3-5 NMSA 1978) did not apply to review of election contest cases.Hannett v. Mowrer, 1927-NMSC-018, 32 N.M. 231, 255 P. 636.\n\nCreation of right of appeal is matter of substantive lawand not within the rule-making power of the supreme court.State v. Arnold, 1947-NMSC-043, 51 N.M. 311, 183 P.2d 845.\n\nTimely filing of the notice of appeal is jurisdictional.Rivera v. King, 1988-NMCA-093, 108 N.M. 5, 765 P.2d 1187, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 785, 765 P2d 758.\n\nLate filing of appeal.— Because timely filing of an appeal is a mandatory precondition rather than an absolute jurisdictional requirement, a trial court may, under unusual circumstances, use its discretion and entertain an appeal even though it is not timely filed. The decision to dismiss an appeal is extreme and must be determined on a case-by-case basis.Trujillo v. Serrano, 1994-NMSC-024, 117 N.M. 273, 871 P.2d 369.\n\nCourt error may excuse late appeal.— One unusual circumstance which would warrant permitting an untimely appeal is if the delay is a result of judicial error. To deny a party the constitutional right to an appeal because of a mistake on the part of the court runs against the most basic precepts of justice and fairness.Trujillo v. Serrano, 1994-NMSC-024, 117 N.M. 273, 871 P.2d 369.\n\nWithin rule-making power to reduce appeal time.— It was within the rule-making power of the supreme court to reduce the time for taking an appeal from six to three months once the legislature had authorized appeal, since the regulation of the manner and time for taking appeal were procedural matters.State v. Arnold, 1947-NMSC-043, 51 N.M. 311, 183 P.2d 845.\n\nDetermination to be final before supreme court review.— The supreme court cannot exercise appellate jurisdiction by appeal or writ of error to review any determination in an inferior tribunal, unless such determination be the final judgment of a court as prescribed by law.Staab v. Atl. & Pac. R.R. Co., 1886-NMSC-015, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 606, 9 P. 381 (decided under former law).\n\nTest of whether judgment is final,so as to permit the taking of an immediate appeal, lies in the effect the judgment has upon the rights of some or all of the parties.Bralley v. City of Albuquerque, 1985-NMCA-043, 102 N.M. 715, 699 P.2d 646.\n\nJudgment lacking decretal language not final.— Court \"order\" that made numerous findings of fact and rulings of law, including a finding that mother was entitled to child support payments and costs from father, but which failed to specifically order that judgment be entered for mother, and did not contain the signatures or initials of the parties' attorneys, was not a final, appealable order because of its lack of decretal language.Khalsa v. Levinson, 1998-NMCA-110, 125 N.M. 680, 964 P.2d 844.\n\n\"Order\" is not final where all parties and the court consider it a non-final order.Hernandez v. Home Educ. Livelihood Program, Inc., 1982-NMCA-079, 98 N.M. 125, 645 P.2d 1381, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794.\n\nReport of grand jury.— Since no parties are involved, and no facts are found nor issues of law decided, the report of a grand jury is not a judgment. Therefore, that report does not constitute a final, appealable order.McKenzie v. Fifth Judicial Dist. Court, 1988-NMCA-085, 107 N.M. 778, 765 P.2d 194, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 785, 765 P2d 758.\n\nOrder deemed \"final\".— An order of dismissal \"without prejudice\" for failure to exhaust administrative remedies was a final order necessitating a timely appeal in order to preserve appellate review.Bralley v. City of Albuquerque, 1985-NMCA-043, 102 N.M. 715, 699 P.2d 646.\n\nAn order dismissing a party's entire complaint, without authorizing or specifying a definite time for leave to file an amended complaint, is a final order for purposes of appeal.Bralley v. City of Albuquerque, 1985-NMCA-043, 102 N.M. 715, 699 P.2d 646.\n\nA ruling of a land use authority granting an application for a special use permit, subject to certain specified conditions, and the district court's affirmance of it were final orders for the purpose of allowing an aggrieved party to seek appellate review.West Gun Club Neighborhood Ass'n v. Extraterritorial Land Use Auth., 2001-NMCA-013, 130 N.M. 195, 22 P.3d 220, cert. denied, 130 N.M. 558, 28 P.3d 1099.\n\nOrders under Uniform Arbitration Act.— Reading this section and 44-7-19(B) NMSA 1978 together because they are in pari materia, the plain meaning of the language indicates that the legislature intended that orders made under the Uniform Arbitration Act of 1971 be no more or less appealable than any other orders in civil actions.Collier v. Pennington, 2003-NMCA-064, 133 N.M. 728, 69 P.3d 238.\n\nOrder compelling arbitrationwas a final order from which defendants were obligated to appeal within 30 days.Lyman v. Kern, 2000-NMCA-013, 128 N.M. 582, 995 P.2d 504, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 688, 997 P.2d 820.\n\nAppellants' claim that nonattorney police court judge was not constitutionally qualifiedto hear their criminal cases was properly taken directly from the district court to the supreme court; the court of appeals did not have jurisdiction thereof.Tsiosdia v. Rainaldi, 1976-NMSC-011, 89 N.M. 70, 547 P.2d 553.\n\nOrder opening up judgment in workmen's compensation case is not final order,but merely interlocutory and not appealable.Davis v. Meadors-Cherry Co., 1957-NMSC-093, 63 N.M. 285, 317 P.2d 901.\n\nOrder opening up judgment is not order vacating judgment.— The order reopening the judgment in workmen's compensation case was not, in effect, an order vacating the judgment.Davis v. Meadors-Cherry Co., 1957-NMSC-093, 63 N.M. 285, 317 P.2d 901.\n\nOrder setting aside default judgment not final.— A district court order setting aside a default judgment in subsequent writ of garnishment stemming from a tort action merely vacated the judgment, leaving the case pending for further determination, and thus was not appealable.Hall v. Hall, 1993-NMCA-038, 115 N.M. 384, 851 P.2d 506.\n\nRemand of zoning decision not final.— A district court's remand of a zoning matter to the city council is not a final, appealable order; before a party would have the right to challenge that order on appeal to the Court of Appeals, it would have to await the council decision on remand, obtain review of the council decision in district court, and then appeal the district court judgment.High Ridge Hinkle Joint Venture v. City of Albuquerque, 1994-NMCA-139, 119 N.M. 29, 888 P.2d 475, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 20, 888 P.2d 466 (1994),aff'd, 1997-NMCA-046, 123 N.M. 394, 940 P.2d 1189,rev'd on other grounds, 1998-NMSC-050, 126 N.M. 413, 970 P.2d 599.\n\nOrder remanding to administrative agency final.— An order by the district court finding a state statute unconstitutional and remanding the case to an administrative agency was final and appealable since, if the agency proceeded under the remanded order, the constitutional question would become moot and would be effectively unreviewable.Bustamante v. De Baca, 1995-NMCA-036, 119 N.M. 739, 895 P.2d 261.\n\nCourt letter classifying marital property not final, appealable order.— Trial court's letter informing the parties that the husband's certified public accountant business would be characterized as a community asset was not a final order from which the husband could appeal.Mitchell v. Mitchell, 1986-NMCA-028, 104 N.M. 205, 719 P.2d 432, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 84, 717 P.2d 60.\n\nDenial of motion for protective order held not appealable.— Doctors' appeal from order denying motion for protective order, which sought to have court order a stay in taking of deposition of patient seeking to perpetuate testimony until such time as court first determined competency of patient as witness, was not an appealable final judgment and was not appealable as interlocutory order where order did not comply with 39-3-4 NMSA 1978.In re Bartow, 1984-NMCA-074, 101 N.M. 532, 685 P.2d 387.\n\nDenial of immunity claim not immediately appealable.— Since 41-4-4A NMSA 1978 of the Tort Claims Act provides a defense to liability, and not absolute immunity from suit, a denial of a claim of immunity under that section does not meet the requirements for immediate appellate review under the collateral order exception to the traditional requirement of finality.Allen v. Board of Educ., 1987-NMCA-152, 106 N.M. 673, 748 P.2d 516.\n\nReview of governmental immunity determination.— As a general matter, the limited exception to the rule of finality known as the collateral order doctrine applies to district court determinations regarding governmental immunity under 37-1-23A NMSA 1978, and such determinations are subject to review by writ of error.Handmaker v. Henney, 1999-NMSC-043, 128 N.M. 328, 992 P.2d 879.\n\nWhen property judgment in divorce proceeding not final for appellate review.— A final property judgment in a petition for dissolution of marriage is not final so as to allow appellate review where the court has failed to determine the parties' rights to custody, support and visitation of minor children, as requested by the pleadings, and has failed to determine that there is no just reason for delay before its decision is final enough to allow appellate review.Thornton v. Gamble, 1984-NMCA-093, 101 N.M. 764, 688 P.2d 1268.\n\nOpen damages award not appealable.— District court's ruling of liability pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 44-6-1 to -15 NMSA 1978, was not a final, appealable judgment since it left open for future resolution the amount of a damages award including attorney's fees.Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Straus, 1993-NMSC-058, 116 N.M. 412, 863 P.2d 447.\n\nIssuance of subpoenas duces tecum to a non-party was a collateral order reviewable by writ of error.— Where plaintiff sued defendants for employment discrimination; plaintiff's spouse, who was not a party to the action, maintained a private law practice; plaintiff alleged that upon filing the complaint, defendants retaliated against plaintiff by asserting irregularities with regard to the gross receipts tax records and returns of the spouse's private law practice; the district court issued subpoenas duces tecum to the spouse and to defendant taxation and revenue department for the spouse's gross receipts tax records and returns; the spouse moved to quash the subpoenas on the grounds that the gross receipts tax information was confidential and privileged; the district court denied the motion; the order denying the motion to quash practically disposed of all issues raised by the spouse; the issue of the spouse's rights and privilege concerning the confidentiality of the gross receipt tax information had nothing to do with the merits of plaintiff's action; and the district court's order was not a final order disposing of the merits of the underlying case and was effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment because the spouse was not a party to the action, the district court's order authorizing the subpoenas was reviewable by writ of error under the collateral order doctrine.Breen v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2012-NMCA-101, 287 P.3d 379.\n\nNonparty attorney's standing to appeal a district court's order striking the attorney's entry of appearance.— Where a court-appointed guardian for an incapacitated person, without the permission of the district court or approval of the conservator for the incapacitated person, hired an attorney to represent the incapacitated person, and where the district court struck the attorney's entry of appearance, holding that the guardian did not have the authority to hire an attorney for the incapacitated person, the nonparty attorney had the right to appeal on his own behalf because he participated in certain court proceedings as an attorney hired to represent the incapacitated person initiated by the court-appointed guardian's request that the district court determine whether the guardianship continued to be necessary, and the district court's order striking the attorney's entry of appearance and barring him from further contact with the incapacitated person directly and sufficiently aggrieved the attorney such that this section affords him the right to appeal that order, even though he did not participate as a party below.Richards v. McEachern, 2020-NMCA-023.\n\nArbitrator's right to appeal district court order vacating arbitration award.— Where husband and wife dissolved their marriage by stipulated judgment, and where, following a dispute over the implementation of the stipulated judgment, husband and wife entered into a settlement agreement that required the parties to submit all disputes or claims to final and binding arbitration, and where the district court vacated the arbitrator's arbitration award and disqualified the arbitrator from serving as arbitrator, finding that the arbitrator demonstrated evident partiality, the arbitrator had the right to appeal the district court's order because the arbitrator was a party under the settlement agreement and the district court's order directly and sufficiently aggrieved the arbitrator such that he had a right to appeal the order.Rogers v. Red Boots Invs., 2020-NMCA-028, cert. denied.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Jurisdiction as May Be Provided by Law: Some Issues at Appellate Jurisdiction in New Mexico,\" see 36 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. By the defendant. In any criminal proceeding in district court an appeal may be taken by the defendant to the supreme court or court of appeals, as appellate jurisdiction may be vested by law in these courts:\n\n(1) within thirty days from the entry of any final judgment;\n\n(2) within ten days after entry of an order denying relief on a petition to review conditions of release pursuant to the Rules of Criminal Procedure [Rule 5-101 NMRA]; or\n\n(3) by filing an application for an order allowing an appeal in the appropriate appellate court within ten days after entry of an interlocutory order or decision in which the district court, in its discretion, makes a finding in the order or decision that the order or decision involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from such order or decision may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\n\nB. By the state. In any criminal proceeding in district court an appeal may be taken by the state to the supreme court or court of appeals, as appellate jurisdiction may be vested by law in these courts:\n\n(1) within thirty days from a decision, judgment or order dismissing a complaint, indictment or information as to any one or more counts;\n\n(2) within ten days from a decision or order of a district court suppressing or excluding evidence or requiring the return of seized property, if the district attorney certifies to the district court that the appeal is not taken for purpose of delay and that the evidence is a substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.\n\nC. No appeal shall be taken by the state when the double jeopardy clause of the United States constitution or the constitution of the state of New Mexico prohibits further prosecution.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 21-10-2.1, enacted by Laws 1972, ch. 71, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For supreme court jurisdiction,seeN.M. Const., art. VI, § 2; 38-3-2, 39-3-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor court of appeals jurisdiction,seeN.M. Const., art. VI, § 29; 34-5-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act,seeChapter 39, Article 7 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor how and when appeal as of right taken,seeRule 12-201 NMRA.\n\nFor interlocutory appeals by permission,seeRule 12-203 NMRA.\n\nFor appeals from orders regarding release entered prior to a judgment of conviction,seeRule 12-204 NMRA.\n\nFor procedure on certiorari to review decision of court of appeals,seeRule 12-502 NMRA.\n\nFor procedure on certification from court of appeals,seeRule 12-606 NMRA.\n\nState's appeal was proper where district court's ruling adversely impacted the state's capacity to present evidence.— Where defendant was charged with homicide by vehicle and driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, the state's appeal of the district court's pretrial ruling prohibiting one of the state's witnesses from testifying as an expert was proper under this section, because the district court's ruling adversely impacted the state's capacity to present evidence that went to the heart of the proof required to establish the element of causation.State v. Ruffin, 2019-NMCA-009.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1972, ch. 71, § 2 repealed 21-10-2.1, 1953 Comp., relating to allowing appeals to defendants, and enacted a new section.\n\nDismissal of charges was not an acquittal and was subject to appeal.— Where defendant's codefendant was acquitted in a separate trial of the identical charges that had been filed against defendant and the trial court adjudged defendant not guilty based on the codefendant's acquittal and dismissed the charges against defendant before defendant's trial had begun, the order of dismissal was not an acquittal of defendant and was appealable by the state.State v. Arevalo, 2002-NMCA-062, 132 N.M. 306, 47 P.3d 866.\n\nDouble jeopardy did not bar state appeal.— Where defendant moved to dismiss the charges for lack of venue at jury selection and the trial court reserved a ruling until the close of the state's case in chief where the trial court granted defendant's motion, and double jeopardy had attached, double jeopardy did not bar the state's appeal.State v. Roybal, 2006-NMCA-043, 139 N.M. 341, 132 P.3d 598, cert. denied, 2006-NMCER-003, 139 N.M. 353, 132 P.3d 1039.\n\n\"Sufficiently aggrieved\" rationale of finality rule.— One exception to the general rule that an appeal lies only from a final judgment, or a practical construction of the term \"finality\", exists when the consequences of an order that is not the last contemplated order in the case are sufficiently severe that the aggrieved party should be granted a right to appeal to alleviate hardship that would otherwise accrue if the appeal were delayed.State v. Durant, 2000-NMCA-066, 129 N.M. 345, 7 P.3d 495.\n\n\"Sufficiently aggrieved\" rationale allows appeal.— Where a jury convicted defendant of felony charges, the trial court entered a conditional discharge order pursuant to Section 31-20-13 NMSA 1978, which provided that without adjudication of guilt, further proceedings would be deferred and ordered defendant to be placed on probation, complete supervision required by the probation authorities, and complete alcohol treatment, defendant had a right to appeal the conditional discharge order because, unless defendant is permitted to appeal the order, the order could be used to enhance the sentence under Section 31-18-17 NMSA 1978.State v. Durant, 2000-NMCA-066, 129 N.M. 345, 7 P.3d 495.\n\nWhere a juvenile was sentenced to six months probation pursuant to a conditional consent decree, the juvenile was sufficiently aggrieved by the decree to allow an appeal even though the consent decree was not the last order contemplated in the case, because even though the charges against the juvenile may be dismissed, the fact of the charges and the consent decree may be considered if other charges arise while the juvenile is a child.State v. Crystal B., 2001-NMCA-010, 130 N.M. 336, 24 P.3d 771.\n\nState's appeal of granting of suppression order.— The state cannot appeal the exclusion of an inadmissible blood alcohol report under Section 39-3-3B(2) NMSA 1978, and double jeopardy precludes the state from trying defendant again because the state refused to present any evidence to satisfy the elements of the charged offense after the jury was impaneled.State v. Gomez, 2006-NMCA-132, 140 N.M. 586, 144 P.3d 145.\n\nSupreme court jurisdiction.— The legislature intended the supreme court to have jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals in situations where a defendant may possibly be sentenced to life imprisonment or death.State v. Smallwood, 2007-NMSC-005, 141 N.M. 178, 152 P.3d 821.\n\nThe supreme court has exclusive jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals from pretrial release ordersin cases where the defendant faces a possible sentence of life imprisonment or death.State v. Brown, 2014-NMSC-038.\n\nChildren's court cases.— Because juvenile delinquency proceedings are sufficiently similar to criminal proceedings, Section 39-3-3B(2) NMSA 1978 governs in the circumstances of interlocutory appeals of suppression orders from a children's court.State v. Jade G., 2007-NMSC-010, 141 N.M. 284, 154 P.3d 659.\n\nAppellate jurisdiction over a district court's decision in an on-record appeal from metropolitan court.— This section does not distinguish the appeal of a judgment in a criminal case originating in the district court from one originating in the metropolitan court, nor does it distinguish the appeal of a district court's on-record review from the appeal of a district court's de novo trial, and therefore the New Mexico court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction to review decisions made in on-record appeals to the district court from the metropolitan court.State v. Armijo, 2016-NMSC-021,aff'g2014-NMCA-013, 316 P.3d 902.\n\n\"Criminal proceeding\" includes on-record appellate decisions of the district court.— This section provides defendants in \"any criminal proceeding\" with the right to appeal a final judgment of the district court to the court of appeals, a reasonable interpretation of which includes a defendant's right to appeal a district court's review of an on-record metropolitan court decision.State v. Carroll, 2015-NMCA-033, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of DWI following a bench trial in metropolitan court, appealed the conviction to the district court for on-record review, which was affirmed by the district court, and then appealed the district court's decision to the court of appeals, the state's claim that there is no express right to appeal a district court's on-record appellate review of a metropolitan court conviction for DWI was in error; a reasonable interpretation of \"criminal proceeding\" includes a district court's on-record review of a metropolitan court decision; therefore a defendant has the right to appeal a district court's review of an on-record metropolitan court decision.State v. Carroll, 2015-NMCA-033, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nDistrict court jurisdiction over issues not included in appeal.— Where defendant was indicted by two separate grand juries; the two indictments were joined for trial; defendant was convicted of violating an order of protection; the district court declared a mistrial on the remaining charges, because the jury was unable to reach a verdict; defendant appealed the conviction of violating an order of protection; and during the pendency of defendant's appeal, defendant was retried and convicted on the mistrial charges, defendant's appeal was limited to only the conviction of violating an order of protection and the district court retained jurisdiction to retry the unresolved charges.State v. Gutierrez, 2011-NMCA-088, 150 N.M. 505, 263 P.3d 282, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-008, 268 P.3d 513.\n\nAppeal of exclusion of statements made during a SANE examination.— Where the trial court excluded the victim's statements to a sexual assault nurse examiner on the morning of trial; the jury had been impaneled, but not sworn; the victim's statements identified the defendant as the perpetrator and described the criminal acts; and the victim was available to testify, the state's appeal was timely and the evidence was sufficiently material to support an appeal.State v. Mendez, 2009-NMCA-060, 146 N.M. 409, 211 P.3d 206,rev'd on other grounds, 2010-NMSC-044, 148 N.M. 761, 242 P.3d 328.\n\nAppeal of exclusion of prior convictions in the penalty phase of a capital felony case.— In a capital felony case, the state has a statutory right to an interlocutory appeal of the district court's pre-trial order excluding the per se introduction of the defendant's prior convictions during the penalty phase of the defendant's trial when the evidence is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.State v. Sanchez, 2008-NMSC-066, 145 N.M. 311, 198 P. 3d 337.\n\nAn order denying and dismissing a petition to revoke probationis not an order from which an appeal can be taken under this section.State v. Grossetete, 2008-NMCA-088, 144 N.M. 346, 187 P.3d 692, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-005, 144 N.M. 331, 187 P.3d 677.\n\nHistory of section.State v. Santillanes, 1980-NMCA-183, 96 N.M. 482, 632 P.2d 359, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 426, 622 P.2d 1046,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 1981-NMSC-064, 96 N.M. 477, 632 P.2d 354.\n\nComputation of time period.— Rule 12-308A NMRA governs the computation of the ten-day period under Paragraph B(2).State v. Fernandez, 1999-NMCA-128, 128 N.M. 111, 990 P.2d 224.\n\nLate filing of appeal.— Because timely filing of an appeal is a mandatory precondition rather than an absolute jurisdictional requirement, a trial court may, under unusual circumstances, use its discretion and entertain an appeal even though it is not timely filed. The decision to dismiss an appeal is extreme and must be determined on a case-by-case basis.Trujillo v. Serrano, 1994-NMSC-024, 117 N.M. 273, 871 P.2d 369.\n\nCourt error may excuse late appeal.— One unusual circumstance that would warrant permitting an untimely appeal is if the delay is a result of judicial error. To deny a party the constitutional right to an appeal because of a mistake on the part of the court runs against the most basic precepts of justice and fairness.Trujillo v. Serrano, 1994-NMSC-024, 117 N.M. 273, 871 P.2d 369.\n\nSupreme court has authority to issue writs of certioraridirected to the court of appeals in a criminal case where the conditions of 34-5-14 NMSA 1978 are met, and the court's original jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari, as provided for in N.M. Const., art. VI, § 3, leaves no doubt as to the power of the court to issue such writs.State v. Gunzelman, 1973-NMSC-055, 85 N.M. 295, 512 P.2d 55,overruled on other grounds byState v. Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, 113 N.M. 780, 833 P.2d 1146.\n\nEntry of judgment.— An appeal can be taken only after entry of judgment.State v. Edmondson, 1991-NMCA-069, 112 N.M. 654, 818 P.2d 855, cert. quashed, 112 N.M. 641, 818 P.2d 419.\n\nFinal order.— An order is final if all issues of law and fact necessary to be determined have been determined and the case has been completely disposed of to the extent that the court has power to dispose of it.State v. Webb, 1990-NMCA-077, 111 N.M. 78, 801 P.2d 660, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 164, 803 P.2d 253.\n\nInitial orders not final.— Where the trial court had made only the initial orders in a multi-part proceeding to determine defendant's competency to stand trial for murder, the orders finding defendant dangerous and incompetent to stand trial from which he appealed were not final orders subject to appellate review.State v. Webb, 1990-NMCA-077, 111 N.M. 78, 801 P.2d 660, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 164, 803 P.2d 253.\n\nOrder allowing withdrawal of a plea agreement is not a final orderfor purpose of filing an appeal under Subsection B(1) of this section.State v. Griego, 2004-NMCA-107, 136 N.M. 272, 96 P.3d 1192.\n\nWhere the district court specifically found that the state presented no witnesses or evidence to substantiate its claim that its case would be prejudiced by a loss of witnesses or evidence if the plea was withdrawn, without a factual basis in the record, the state=s bare assertions of prejudice gives no reason to find such a substantial interest so as to create an exception to the rule requiring appeals be taken only from final orders.State v. Griego, 2004-NMCA-107, 136 N.M. 272, 96 P.3d 1192.\n\nMagistrate court orders suppressing evidence were not final ordersin either an actual or practical sense.State v. Heinsen, 2004-NMCA-110, 136 N.M. 295, 97 P.3d 627,aff'd, 2005-NMSC-035, 138 N.M. 441, 121 P.3d 1040.\n\nOrder disqualifying counsel.— A trial court order disqualifying defendant's counsel is not a final, appealable order.State v. Pacheco, 1993-NMCA-033, 115 N.M. 325, 850 P.2d 1028.\n\nReview of disqualification of prosecutor.— On appeal from an order dismissing an indictment the appellate courts may also review a second portion of the order that disqualifies the prosecutor on grounds related to those supporting the dismissal of the indictment.State v. Armijo, 1994-NMCA-136, 118 N.M. 802, 887 P.2d 1269.\n\nAllowance of interlocutory appeal is discretionarywith the appellate court.State v. Hernandez, 1980-NMCA-138, 95 N.M. 125, 619 P.2d 570, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 299, 621 P.2d 516.\n\nTrial court does not have authority to grant interlocutory appeal.State v. Garcia, 1977-NMCA-116, 91 N.M. 131, 571 P.2d 123.\n\nWhen permission to appeal from interlocutory order is denied,the appellate court never assumes jurisdiction of the matter, consequently, jurisdiction remains in the trial court and there is nothing to prevent the trial court from proceeding to try the pending case.State v. Hernandez, 1980-NMCA-138, 95 N.M. 125, 619 P.2d 570, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 299, 621 P.2d 516.\n\nCourt of appeals granted interlocutory appeal on denied motion to dismiss.— Where on the basis of the municipal court convictions defendant moved that the indictment be dismissed, claiming the district court prosecution was barred by the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy which the district court denied, the court of appeals granted an interlocutory appeal pursuant to this section.State v. Tanton, 1975-NMCA-054, 88 N.M. 5, 536 P.2d 269,rev'd on other grounds, 1975-NMSC-057, 88 N.M. 333, 540 P.2d 813.\n\nExceptions to dismissal of indictment or information.— Although Subsection B(1) of this section requires that the order dismiss the indictment or information, there are exceptions to this general rule.State v. Griego, 2004-NMCA-107, 136 N.M. 272, 96 P.3d 1192.\n\nNo appeal from denial of motion to suppress.— Where defendant filed a motion to suppress which was denied by the trial court, and defendant attempted to appeal from that order, relying on language of the trial court attempting to grant an interlocutory appeal, there was no final judgment in this case or any matter involving conditions of release, and the appeal did not come within this section.State v. Garcia, 1977-NMCA-116, 91 N.M. 131, 571 P.2d 123.\n\nAppeal from suppression order.— Since the state has no constitutional appeal as of right from a suppression order, the time for filing such an appeal is governed by the ten-day limit in Paragraph B(2) of this section and not the thirty-day limit provided for in Rule 12-201A NMRA.State v. Alvarez, 1991-NMCA-115, 113 N.M. 82, 823 P.2d 324, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 23, 821 P.2d 1060.\n\nBecause the state did not intend to use at trial any of the physical evidence seized or statements made as the result of a stop, the state would have been unable to, and indeed was not required, to appeal the suppression order within ten days after the trial court's ruling.State v. Harris, 1993-NMCA-115, 116 N.M. 234, 861 P.2d 275.\n\nThe right of the state to appeal orders of suppression from the district court is created by statute as set forth in Subsection B of this section, which has been held not to be a statutory codification of the state's constitutional right to appeal.State v. Heinsen, 2004-NMCA-110, 136 N.M. 295, 97 P.3d 627,aff'd, 2005-NMSC-035, 138 N.M. 441, 121 P.3d 1040.\n\nThe state may obtain judicial review of a suppression order of a magistrate court by filing a nolle prosequi to dismiss some or all of the charges in the magistrate court after the suppression order is entered, and refiling in the district court for a trial de novo.State v. Heinsen, 2005-NMSC-035, 138 N.M. 441, 121 P.3d 1040.\n\nTimeliness of appeal.— Where the suppression orders were filed on January 15, 2003, and the notice of appeal was filed on January 24, 2003, it was timely under Subsection B(2) of this section.State v. Jade G., 2005-NMCA-019, 137 N.M. 128, 108 P.3d 534,aff'd, 2007-NMSC-010, 141 N.M. 284, 154 P.3d 659.\n\nTolling of appeal period.— Motions to reconsider filed within the permissible appeal period suspend the finality of an appealable order or judgment and toll the time to appeal until the district court has ruled on the motion.State v. Suskiewich, 2014-NMSC-040.\n\nUntimely notice of appeal.— Where state's motion to reconsider district court's order suppressing evidence was filed outside the permissible ten-day appeal period set forth in Subsection B(2) of this section, the motion did not toll the appeal period, and the state's notice of appeal, filed nine days after the denial of the motion to reconsider, was untimely.State v. Suskiewich, 2014-NMSC-040.\n\nDocketing statement treated as application for interlocutory appeal.— Where the docketing statement proceeded on the basis that the appeal was as of right, and it was not, the court of appeals treated the docketing statement as an application for an interlocutory appeal, and denied it.State v. Garcia, 1977-NMCA-116, 91 N.M. 131, 571 P.2d 123.\n\nState's right to appeal independent of statutory authority.— Where the district court dismissed the state's motion to revoke defendant's probation on the ground that the adjudicatory hearing on the motion did not occur within 100 days after defendant was arrested contrary to the requirement of Rule 5-805 NMRA, the district court acted as a matter of law and the state's right to appeal stemmed from N.M. const., art. IV, § 2 and was independent of Section 39-3-3 NMSA 1978.State v. Montoya, 2011-NMCA-009, 149 N.M. 242, 247 P.3d 1127, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-001, 150 N.M. 558, 263 P.3d 900.\n\nState's constitutional right to appeal.— This section recognizes the state's constitutional right to appeal, identifies circumstances permitting ordinary and interlocutory appeals and affirms the constitutional prohibition against appeals that would violate double jeopardy principles.State v. Santillanes, 1980-NMCA-183, 96 N.M. 482, 632 P.2d 359,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 1981-NMSC-064, 96 N.M. 477, 632 P.2d 354.\n\nThe state has a constitutional right to appeal an order of the trial court which struck the enhancement portion of an indictment and dismissed the enhancement proceeding, with prejudice.State v. Santillanes, 1980-NMCA-183, 96 N.M. 482, 632 P.2d 359,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 1981-NMSC-064, 96 N.M. 477, 632 P.2d 354.\n\nCertification is neither a jurisdictional limitation nor a mandatory precondition.— New Mexico law does not bar appellate review when the state timely files its notice of appeal but fails to make the necessary certification to the district court or attach a copy of the certification to the notice of appeal. Section 39-3-3(B)(2) NMSA 1978 does not limit the court of appeal's general subject matter jurisdiction either expressly or implicitly. Rule 12-202(D) NMRA does not establish a mandatory precondition to an appeal.State v. Vasquez, 2014-NMSC-010, rev'g 2012-NMCA-107.\n\nRemedy for failure to file a certification.— When the prosecutor files an interlocutory appeal and fails to make a timely certification to the district court or fails to attach a copy of the certification to the notice of appeal, the interlocutory appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Instead of summarily dismissing an appeal that may affect a defendant's substantive rights, the better policy is to assess the circumstances of each case and hear the appeal when (1) the intent to appeal a specific judgment can be fairly inferred, and (2) the defendant is not prejudiced by any technical error or mistake. Sanctions are an appropriate means to ensure compliance with Rule 12-202 NMRA.State v. Vasquez, 2014-NMSC-010,rev'g2012-NMCA-107.\n\nFailure to file a certification.— Where defendant was charged with criminal sexual contact of a minor child; the district court excluded the testimony of the child and the parent of the child because the defense had not been able to interview them; the state filed an interlocutory appeal that did not contain the district attorney's certification to the district court as provided for in 39-3-3(B)(2) NMSA 1978; and a year after filing the interlocutory appeal and before the court of appeals heard the appeal, the state filed an amended notice of appeal that included the certification language and stated that the notice of appeal related back to the original notice of appeal; and the state's intent to appeal the exclusion of the two critical witnesses could be fairly inferred from the record and defendant was not prejudiced by the state's failure to attach a copy of the certification to the notice of appeal, the court of appeals erred in dismissing the interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction.State v. Vasquez, 2014-NMSC-010,rev'g2012-NMCA-107.\n\nCertification language is mandatory.— Filing a timely appeal and the inclusion of the certification that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay and that the evidence that has been suppressed is a substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding in the state's notice of appeal are mandatory preconditions to the exercise of the court of appeals' jurisdiction to hear the state's appeal and the court of appeals will not exercise its discretion to hear the state's appeal when the certification is lacking, absent a showing of exceptional circumstances.State v. Vasquez, 2014-NMSC-010,rev'g2012-NMCA-107.\n\nWhere the district court excluded the testimony of the alleged victim and the victim's parent in a case of sexual contact of a minor, kidnapping and bribery of a witness; the state filed a timely notice of appeal, but failed to certify that the appeal was not taken for purposes of delay and that the excluded evidence was substantial proof of a material fact in the case; the state filed an amended notice of appeal almost one year later which included the required certification; the state never requested leave to amend the notice of appeal or an extension of the filing deadline; and the state explained the failure to include the certification in the notice of appeal as an inadvertent omission, the court of appeals did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the state failed to show exceptional circumstances to justify its failure to file a notice of appeal that complied with the mandatory statutory requirements and the amended notice of appeal did not relate back to the filing of the original notice of appeal.State v. Vasquez, 2014-NMSC-010,rev'g2012-NMCA-107.\n\nAppeals by state.— Although the state may appeal an order granting a new trial in a criminal case, an immediate appeal is limited to an order in which it is claimed: (1) the grant of a new trial was based on an erroneous conclusion; (2) prejudicial legal error occurred during the trial; or, (3) newly-discovered evidence warrants a new trial. Thus, an immediate appeal by the state of an order granting a new criminal trial is limited to issues of law.State v. Griffin, 1994-NMSC-061, 117 N.M. 745, 877 P.2d 551.\n\nThe state may appeal any order dismissing one or more counts of a complaint, indictment, or information, regardless of whether the dismissal is with prejudice.State v. Armijo, 1994-NMCA-136, 118 N.M. 802, 887 P.2d 1269.\n\nThe state has the right to appeal a ruling excluding the state's witness where the ruling was based on an interpretation of the contributing to the delinquency of a minor statute that controls the course of the presentation of material evidence in the case.State v. Romero, 2000-NMCA-029, 128 N.M. 806, 999 P.2d 1038.\n\nAppellate jurisdiction over a district court's order that was functionally equivalent to a dismissal of a charged offense.— Where defendant was charged with second-degree murder and the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter, and where the district court judge found that there was no probable cause to bind defendant over for trial on second-degree murder and entered an order binding defendant over for trial on voluntary manslaughter alone, and where defendant argued that the New Mexico court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider the state's appeal, claiming that the district court did not \"dismiss\" the state's second-degree murder count, but rather merely \"diminished\" the count to the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter, the court of appeals had jurisdiction to review the district court's order because the district court's order binding defendant over only on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter, when both second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter were charged in the state's criminal information, was functionally equivalent to a dismissal of the second-degree murder charge, and the state is authorized in a criminal case to appeal any order dismissing one or more counts of a complaint, indictment or information, regardless of whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice.State v. Benedict, 2022-NMCA-030, cert. granted.\n\nState's right to appeal.— Where the district court dismissed the state's case without prejudice after a finding that the state was not ready to proceed to trial after substitute counsel indicated that the state would be ready to proceed, the order of dismissal was appealable pursuant to this section regardless of whether the dismissal was without prejudice, because the legislature intended to permit the state to appeal any order dismissing one or more counts of a complaint, indictment, or information, regardless of whether the dismissal is without prejudice.State v. Lucero, 2017-NMCA-079, cert. denied.\n\n\"Substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding\" construed.— The state may appeal pursuant to Subsection B of this section when the excluded evidence is important or significant, as opposed to evidence of minor consequence.State v. Adams, 2019-NMCA-043, 447 P.3d 1142,aff'd by2022-NMSC-008.\n\nState had the right to appeal the exclusion of important or significant evidence.— Where defendant was arrested for DWI, and where the district court excluded the results of defendant's blood test on the basis that the emergency medical technician who drew defendant's blood was not authorized to do so under the Implied Consent Act, 66-8-105 to 66-8-112 NMSA 1978, the state had the right to appeal the exclusion of evidence because while the test results did not register any blood alcohol content, defendant's blood tested positive for marijuana-related metabolites, benzodiazepines, and synthetic opioids, and the test results were necessary to prove the amount of drugs remaining in defendant's system at the time of arrest in order to show that he was still impaired. Defendant's blood test results were \"important or significant\" under the circumstances of this case, and therefore constitute substantial proof of a fact material sufficient to allow an interlocutory appeal.State v. Adams, 2019-NMCA-043, 447 P.3d 1142,aff'd by2022-NMSC-008.\n\nAppeal after remand to magistrate.— District court's order remanding defendant's misdemeanor DWI trial to magistrate court was, in effect, a dismissal of the charges against defendant; thus, under the doctrine of practical finality, the appellate court had jurisdiction to review the state's appeal. State v. Ahasteen, 1998-NMCA-158, 126 N.M. 238, 968 P.2d 328, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 532, 972 P.2d 351.\n\nRule restricting state's bases for appeal retracted.— Restrictive nature of Rule 71(b), N.M.R.P. Metro. Cts. (now Rule 7-703B), in providing only two bases for appeal by the state, unconstitutionality of statute and insufficiency of complaint, limits the state's substantive right to appeal provided by the New Mexico constitution and is therefore invalid and retracted.Smith v. Love, 1984-NMSC-061, 101 N.M. 355, 683 P.2d 37 (decided under prior law).\n\nPost-conviction proceedings must be invoked before habeas corpus may be sought.In re Martinez, 1982-NMSC-115, 99 N.M. 198, 656 P.2d 861.\n\nFederal habeas review denied.— Because of the petitioner's default in not appealing his convictions and sentences directly in state court, federal habeas review of his claims is barred unless the petitioner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation; the petitioner would have to show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded his efforts to comply with the state's procedural rule.Lepiscopo v. Tansy, 38 F.3d 1128 (10th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1025, 115 S. Ct. 1376, 131 L. Ed. 2d 230 (1995).\n\nPresumption of ineffective assistance of counsel.— The conclusive presumption of ineffective assistance of counsel established in State v. Duran, 1986-NMCA-125, 105 N.M. 231, 731 P.2d 374 applies to appeals from a de novo trial in district court following a conviction in magistrate or municipal court.State v. Cannon, 2014-NMCA-058, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-006.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of aggravated DWI by a jury in magistrate court; defendant timely appealed the conviction to district court and filed a demand for a jury trial; the district court denied defendant's request for a jury trial; at a bench trial, the district court found defendant guilty of DWI; and defendant filed an untimely notice of appeal with the district court, defense counsel was conclusively presumed to be ineffective.State v. Cannon, 2014-NMCA-058, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-006.\n\nPresumption of ineffective assistance of counsel applies to failure to file timely notice of appeal.— A criminal defendant, whose counsel files an untimely notice of appeal from the district court's on-record review of a metropolitan court decision, is entitled to a conclusive presumption of ineffective assistance of counsel.State v. Vigil, 2014-NMCA-096, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-009.\n\nPresumption of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to timely file a notice of appeal still applies after four years of inaction.— The first and foremost reason that the passage of time alone does not prevent application of the presumption of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to timely file a notice of appeal is based on the fundamental premise that the rights implicated by the presumption, the right to appeal and the right to effective assistance of counsel, protect a defendant's fundamental liberty interest in a fair trial. This interest is no less significant after the deadline for appeal than it was before the deadline, nor does it diminish over time, and therefore where defendant appealed from a stipulated corrected sentence that was entered four years after the original judgment and sentence, after which defendant filed neither an appeal nor an affidavit of waiver, the presumption of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to file a timely notice of appeal still applied.State v. Dorais, 2016-NMCA-049, cert. denied.\n\nUntimely notice waived where counsel ineffective.— Where defendant's counsel filed a notice of appeal sixty-two days after the entry of an order revoking defendant's probation and failed to timely file a motion for an extension of time; the court of appeals determined that defendant had a right to counsel at the probation revocation hearing because defendant raised issues that required assistance of counsel, the filing of the notice of appeal was defendant's counsel's responsibility because it is only after the filing of the docketing statement that trial counsel's responsibility to the client ceases, defendant had a fundamental liberty interest at stake in the revocation of defendant' probation that entitled defendant to minimal due process, and defendant had a right to appeal the revocation which defendant had not waived, the court of appeals presumed that defendant's counsel's failure to timely file a notice of appeal was per se ineffective assistance of counsel and considered defendant's appeal as if timely filed.State v. Leon, 2013-NMCA-011, 292 P.3d 493, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-012.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Survey of New Mexico Law, 1979-80: Criminal Law and Procedure,\" see 11 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. In any civil action or special statutory proceeding in the district court, when the district judge makes an interlocutory order or decision which does not practically dispose of the merits of the action and he believes the order or decision involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order or decision may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in the order or decision.\n\nB. The supreme court or court of appeals has jurisdiction over an appeal from such an interlocutory order or decision, as appellate jurisdiction may be vested in those courts. Within fifteen days after entry of the order or decision, any party aggrieved may file with the clerk of the supreme court or court of appeals an application for an order allowing an appeal, accompanied by a copy of the interlocutory order or decision.\n\nC. Application under this section for an order allowing appeal does not stay proceedings in the district court unless so ordered by the district judge or a judge or justice of the court to which application is made.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 21-10-3, enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 40, § 1; 1999, ch. 80, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For appellate jurisdiction of supreme court,seeN.M. Const., art. VI, § 2; 39-3-2, 39-3-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor jurisdiction of court of appeals,seeN.M. Const., art. VI, § 29.\n\nFor Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act,seeChapter 39, Article 7 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor appellate jurisdiction of court of appeals,see34-5-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor when appeals taken,seeRules 12-201 and 12-203 NMRA.\n\nFor procedure on certiorari to review decision of court of appeals,seeRule 12-502 NMRA.\n\nFor procedure on certification from court of appeals,seeRule 12-606 NMRA.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, in Subsection B, substituted \"fifteen days\" for \"ten days\" in the second sentence, and deleted the former last sentence, which read \"If an application has not been acted upon within twenty days, it shall be deemed denied\", and made a minor stylistic change.\n\nFinal order as to one plaintiff.— Where both plaintiffs were parties to counts I through III of the complaint; plaintiff Bigbyte was not a party to count IV; the parties dismissed count III; the district court granted summary judgment against plaintiffs on counts I and II; count IV remained pending before the district court; and the district court's summary judgment provided that the summary judgment did not practically dispose of the merits of the case, but did finally dispose of the claims raised in counts I and II; that the summary judgment involved a controlling question of law as to which there was a substantial ground for differences of opinion, and \"an immediate appeal from the summary judgment may materially advance the ultimate termination of litigation and there is no just cause for delay\"; the summary judgment was a final judgment as to Bigbyte because all of Bigbyte's claims had been disposed of and the summary judgment did not contain express language stating that the summary judgment was not a final order as to Bigbyte.Santa Fe Pacific Trust, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 2012-NMSC-028, 285 P.3d 595.\n\nAppeal of barred issues.— An application for interlocutory appeal will not be granted where the controlling questions of law advanced by the appellant relate to issues that the district court, in its partial judgment, barred as untimely raised.Ellis v. Cigna Prop. & Cas. Cos., 2007-NMCA-123, 142 N.M. 497, 167 P.3d 945, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-009, 142 N.M. 715, 169 P.3d 408.\n\nJurisdiction over interlocutory appeal.— Court of appeals had jurisdiction to entertain petitioner's application for interlocutory appeal, even though the application was granted more than 20 days after it was filed.Lovelace Med. Ctr. v. Mendez, 1991-NMSC-002, 111 N.M. 336, 805 P.2d 603.\n\nThe legislature did not intend the 20-day requirement in this section to be a limitation on the appellate courts' jurisdiction, conferred by that section, over interlocutory appeals. The requirement, in other words, was intended to assist the courts with the management of their cases in the absence of some other provision, not to limit the courts' jurisdiction.Lovelace Med. Ctr. v. Mendez, 1991-NMSC-002, 111 N.M. 336, 805 P.2d 603.\n\nAllowance of interlocutory appeal is discretionarywith the appellate court.State v. Hernandez, 1980-NMCA-138, 95 N.M. 125, 619 P.2d 570, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 299, 621 P.2d 516.\n\nRequirements of interlocutory appeals.— Interlocutory appeals require the existence of a substantial difference of opinion on a controlling issue of law. Starko, Inc., et al. v. Cimarron Health Plan, Inc., 2005-NMCA-040, 137 N.M. 310, 110 P.3d 526, cert denied, 2005-NMCERT-004, 137 N.M. 454, 112 P.3d 1111.\n\nAllowance of appeal not subject to challenge.— The acceptance of an appeal by the court of appeals when there has been compliance with Subsection A of this section, is not subject to challenge.Salazar v. St. Vincent Hosp., 1980-NMCA-095, 96 N.M. 409, 631 P.2d 315,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 1980-NMSC-124, 95 N.M. 147, 619 P.2d 823.\n\nWhen permission to appeal from interlocutory order is denied,the appellate court never assumes jurisdiction of the matter; consequently, jurisdiction remains in the trial court and there is nothing to prevent the trial court from proceeding to try the pending case.State v. Hernandez, 1980-NMCA-138, 95 N.M. 125, 619 P.2d 570, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 299, 621 P.2d 516.\n\nExtension of time for interlocutory appeal.— Absent statutory authority or supreme court rule, appellate courts may not extend the time for an interlocutory appeal, even to relieve against mistake, inadvertence or accident. However, in appropriate circumstances, the district court may reconsider the issue and enter a second interlocutory order from which application for a timely interlocutory appeal may be made.Candelaria v. Middle Rio Grande Conservancy Dist., 1988-NMCA-065, 107 N.M. 579, 761 P.2d 457.\n\nSection gives jurisdiction to appellate court to deny motion for summary judgment.— This section, along with 34-5-8 NMSA 1978, gives court of appeals jurisdiction over interlocutory appeal from an order or decision which does not practically dispose of the merits of the case. Therefore court could hear appeal of defendant whose motion for summary judgment in medical malpractice suit was denied.Vaca v. Whitaker, 1974-NMCA-011, 86 N.M. 79, 519 P.2d 315.\n\nSection does not give jurisdiction to appellate court to grant motion to dismiss.— Where an order denying defendant's motion to dismiss was a part of the main action, no final judgment or interlocutory order which practically disposed of the merits having been entered, and the order did not contain the requisite finding on which to base an application for an interlocutory appeal under this section, the argument that a decision whether to make the requisite finding should only have been made by the judge who held the motion hearing and could not have properly been made by a different judge was not an issue in the appeal because the order denying the motion to dismiss was not an appealable order.Miller v. City of Albuquerque, 1975-NMCA-099, 88 N.M. 324, 540 P.2d 254, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 319, 540 P.2d 249.\n\nOrder disqualifying counsel.— Although an order disqualifying counsel may not be properly appealed under the collateral order doctrine, an appellate court may hear the issue if it is certified by the trial court for interlocutory appeal.Sanders v.

Said bond shall be conditioned to prosecute the appeal with effect and pay all damages and costs that may result to the appellee, if said appeal or writ of error be dismissed or the judgment or decree appealed from shall be affirmed. In case the title to or possession of real estate is involved in such action, the rental value, and all damages to improvements and waste, shall be considered elements of damages.\n\nHistory:Laws 1933, ch. 6, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 19-1006; 1953 Comp., § 21-10-6.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For supersedeas and stay in civil action,see39-3-22 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor supersedeas and stay,seeRule 12-207 NMRA.\n\nNot applicable as bond for value of property sought.— This section was not considered to be applicable as a bond for the value of the property of which possession was sought.Burroughs v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co., 1964-NMSC-244, 74 N.M. 618, 397 P.2d 10,overruled on other grounds byQuintana v. Knowles, 1992-NMSC-016, 113 N.M. 382, 827 P.2d 97.\n\nSupersedeas bond not required in adjudication of title.— Where party out of possession of real estate appeals from an adverse judgment, decreeing title in party in possession, supersedeas bond is not required.Higgins v. Fuller, 1943-NMSC-033, 48 N.M. 215, 148 P.2d 573.\n\nSelf-executing judgment not encompassed by section.— Supersedeas bond is not required where, under judgment from which appeal is made, there would be no judgment to stay nor any change as to status of the parties regarding either title or possession, as a self-executing judgment, order or decree which does not command or permit performance of an act or which cannot be actively enforced by execution, etc., is not encompassed by the section.Higgins v. Fuller, 1943-NMSC-033, 48 N.M. 215, 148 P.2d 573.\n\nThe posting of a supersedeas bond is necessary to maintain the status quo when appealing from a judgment decreeing ownership of realty in a party not in possession thereof; however, such a bond is not required where, under the judgment appealed from, there exists no judgment to stay, no change in the ownership or possession of the property, and such a bond would serve no purpose. Thus, a self-executing judgment or order which does not command or permit that any act be done, or is not of a nature to be actively enforced by execution or otherwise, is not within this section.Salas v. Bolagh, 1987-NMCA-138, 106 N.M. 613, 747 P.2d 259.\n\nIf status quo to be maintained, bond to be provided.— This section is nothing more than a provision that if the status quo is to be maintained a supersedeas bond must be provided in such an amount as will \"indemnify the appellee, from all damages that may result from such supersedeas,\" the amount to be fixed by the court. Absent an order of the court and a bond, the judgment remains in effect and may be enforced.Gregg v. Gardner, 1963-NMSC-223, 73 N.M. 347, 388 P.2d 68.\n\nWhere posting of supersedeas bond not prerequisite to appeal.— As a precondition to operation of this section, the appellant must have moved for supersedeas, and the trial court must have granted the motion. Nothing in this section requires the appellant to post a supersedeas bond when supersedeas has not been sought and granted. Where no stay has been sought, a trial court, under this section, cannot order the appellant to post a bond.Quintana v. Knowles, 1992-NMSC-016, 113 N.M. 382, 827 P.2d 97.\n\nAmount of supersedeas bond was not excessive.— Where the appraised value of defendant's home was $206,000; the property sold for $100,000 or 48.7% of appraised value at the foreclosure sale; the purchaser purchased the property for a potential profit of $106,000 if the property were resold; the district court considered the lost rental value, interest on the money paid to purchase the property, and the potential for damages and waste to the property while the appeal was pending, the district court did not abuse its discretion in setting the supersedeas bond at $150,000, regardless of the fact that defendant could afford to post only a $50,000 supersedeas bond.Charter Bank v.

Any person convicted of criminal contempt of the court of appeals, except criminal contempt committed in the presence of the court of appeals, may appeal to the supreme court within thirty days from the judgment of conviction. In any case of criminal contempt, the taking of an appeal operates to stay execution of the judgment without bond.\n\nB. In habeas corpus proceedings, where the petitioner is held upon an order, warrant or commitment of any court, and is ordered discharged and released from custody by any district court, the officer having custody of the petitioner, or the district attorney of the district wherein the proceedings are instituted, on behalf of the state, may appeal within thirty days from the order of discharge to the supreme court or the court of appeals, as appellate jurisdiction may be vested by law in these courts. The appeal shall not operate as a stay of execution.

The bond shall be conditioned for the payment of the judgment and all costs that may be finally adjudged against the appellant or plaintiff in error if the appeal or writ of error is dismissed or the judgment or decision of the district court is affirmed. The district court, for good cause shown, may grant the appellant not to exceed thirty days' additional time within which to file the bond, and a like extension of time may be granted by the supreme court in cases of writs of error upon a like showing.\n\nB. If the decision appealed from, or from which a writ of error is sued out, is for a recovery other than a fixed amount of money, the amount of the bond, if any, shall be fixed by the district court if an appeal is taken or, in case of a writ of error, by the chief justice or any justice of the supreme court, conditioned that the appellant or plaintiff in error shall prosecute the appeal or writ of error with diligence and that if the decision of the district court is affirmed or the appeal or writ of error is dismissed, the appellant or plaintiff in error will comply with the judgment of the district court and pay all damages and costs finally adjudged against the appellant or plaintiff in error in the district court and in the supreme court or court of appeals on the appeal or writ of error, including any legal damages caused by taking the appeal, whether the damages are assessed upon motion in the cause or in a civil action on the bond.\n\nC.

Rule 1-062(D) NMRA provides for factors that must be considered by the court in determining the amount of a bond that will protect a judgment holder who must delay execution of the judgment pending appeal. Section 39-3-22 NMSA 1978 expands upon the purpose of Rule 1-062(D) NMRA by providing an alternative mechanism for enduring that the holder of a judgment is adequately protected from any damage that may result from a stay of the judgment pending appeal.Grassie v. Roswell Hosp. Corp., 2008-NMCA-076, 144 N.M. 241, 185 P.3d 1091, cert. quashed, 2009-NMCERT-005, 146 N.M. 728, 214 P.3d 793.\n\nTime period to seek supersedeas bond.— The time period specified in Paragraph D of Rule 1-062 NMRA in which an appellant may seek a supersedeas bond prevails over the time period specified in Subsection A of Section 39-3-22 NMSA 1978.Jones v. Harris News, Inc., 2010-NMCA-088, 148 N.M. 612, 241 P.3d 613.\n\nTime limitations must be complied with.— Although a district court has the inherent power to stay execution of a judgment rendered, the party must show the existence of exceptional, equitable grounds justifying the granting of a stay when the statute or rule does not otherwise provide for such relief. A party may not, however, disregard the time limitations of Subsection A and Rule 1-062D NMRA, and then post a supersedeas bond or obtain a stay of execution.Long v. Continental Divide Elec.

State Police Dep't, 1988-NMSC-102, 108 N.M. 72, 766 P.2d 916.\n\nCircumventing prohibitions against summary execution.— The prevailing party at trial may not circumvent prohibitions against summarily executing upon his judgment until the time for permitting the trial court to act upon motions for obtaining supersedeas has expired.Devlin v. State ex rel. N.M. State Police Dep't, 1988-NMSC-102, 108 N.M. 72, 766 P.2d 916.\n\nAppellant not allowed to correct imperfect bond.— Where an imperfect supersedeas bond has been filed, which was nevertheless sufficient as a cost bond, appellant may not correct the record by filing another supersedeas bond, after the time allowed, since to do so would prejudice the rights of appellee.Mundy v. Irwin, 1914-NMSC-043, 19 N.M. 170, 141 P. 877 (decided under former law).\n\nBond can act as cost bond.— A bond filed 37 days after appeal, purporting to be a supersedeas bond which was ineffective for that purpose, because conditioned only for the payment of costs, is nevertheless sufficient as a cost bond, having been filed before any advantage was taken of the failure to file within 30 days.Mundy v. Irwin, 1914-NMSC-043, 19 N.M. 170, 141 P. 877 (decided under former law).\n\nFailure to post a supersedeas bond to stay a foreclosure salepending review does not bar restitution if the district court's judgment is reversed.Bank of Santa Fe v.

The allowable costs are specified. Absent objection or a court order to the contrary, the clerk is to tax the costs in question.\n\nDiscretion of court.— The assessment of costs is entrusted to the sound discretion of the court, and absent a showing of an abuse of discretion, a reviewing court will not interfere with such discretion.In re Adoption of Stailey, 1994-NMCA-015, 117 N.M. 199, 870 P.2d 161.\n\nThe district court abused its discretion in denying the award of costs to the prevailing party.— Where plaintiffs sued the department of transportation (DOT) for personal injuries and loss of consortium following a vehicle collision on New Mexico highway 599 (NM 599) in Santa Fe county, New Mexico that resulted in one death and severe injuries to plaintiff, alleging that DOT's inadequate traffic controls and warnings caused the collision, and where, following a three-day jury trial, the jury rendered its verdict in favor of DOT, and where, following the entry of the verdict, the district court denied DOT's bill of costs, the district court abused its discretion in denying the award of costs to DOT, because if the district court, in the exercise of its discretion, does not award costs to the prevailing party, it should specify the reasons for its denial unless the basis for denying costs is clear from the record, and, in this case, the district court did not explain the basis for its decision to deny costs.Garcia v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2023-NMCA-066, cert. denied.\n\nReducing award of costs based on financial disparity between parties.— The district court abused its discretion when, without evidence, it reduced a cost award to defendant because of the financial disparity between the parties, plaintiff's perceived inability to pay all of defendant's costs, and the chilling effect that a large cost award would have on future litigation under the Motor Vehicle Dealers Franchising Act.Key v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 2000-NMSC-010, 128 N.M. 739, 998 P.2d 575.\n\nExpenses not costs.— Expenses for photocopies, telephone, facsimile, courier, mileage, travel, and per diem, and a large expense paid for obtaining plaintiff's own medical records, were not properly recoverable as costs.Gillingham v.

Martinez, 1997-NMCA-096, 123 N.M. 816, 945 P.2d 1034.\n\nCosts need not be awarded.— Where the district court imposed the sanction of dismissal against plaintiff for discovery violations, it did not abuse its discretion in viewing the assessment of costs as an additional sanction and, thus, grounds for refusing to award defendant its costs.Reed v. Furr's Supermarkets, Inc., 2000-NMCA-091, 129 N.M. 639, 11 P.3d 603, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 599, 11 P.3d 563.\n\nCosts may be recovered against state.— The legislature, in this section, gives express authority, without exception, to the recovery of costs against any losing party, including the state.Kirby v.

Hudson, 2003-NMCA-139, 134 N.M. 564, 80 P.3d 501.\n\nDecision to award costs on appeal is within discretion of supreme courtand is final.Spingola v.

Found. Reserve Ins. Co., 1988-NMSC-052, 107 N.M. 322, 757 P.2d 792.\n\nAction under Children's Code.— A specific Children's Code provision for assessing costs, former 32-1-41 NMSA 1978, controlled, in a child abuse and neglect proceeding, over this general statute.State ex rel.

Absent a finding of bad faith or misconduct by a prevailing party during litigation, neither Rule 1-054E NMRA nor this section authorizes a court to award costs against a prevailing party.In re Adoption of Stailey, 1994-NMCA-015, 117 N.M. 199, 870 P.2d 161.\n\nCosts awarded to party supporting valuation determined by court.— Where central issue is valuation of plaintiff's interest in an LLC, and where trial court entered judgment for plaintiff on the amount defendant agreed was the value of plaintiff's interest rather than on higher amount claimed by plaintiff, defendant was the prevailing party for purpose of awarding costs to defendant.Mayeux v. Winder, 2006-NMCA-028, 139 N.M. 235, 131 P.3d 85.\n\nMediation costs not recoverable.— Where mediation is conducted pursuant to agreement of the parties, not by order of the court, the expense of the mediator's fee should not be a recoverable cost, absent an enforceable agreement permitting such award.Smith v.
