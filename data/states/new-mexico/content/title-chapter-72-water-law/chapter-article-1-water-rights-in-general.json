      "text": "All natural waters flowing in streams and watercourses, whether such be perennial, or torrential, within the limits of the state of New Mexico, belong to the public and are subject to appropriation for beneficial use. A watercourse is hereby defined to be any river, creek, arroyo, canyon, draw or wash, or any other channel having definite banks and bed with visible evidence of the occasional flow of water.\n\nHistory:Laws 1907, ch. 49, § 1; Code 1915, § 5654; C.S. 1929, § 151-101; Laws 1941, ch. 126, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 77-101; 1953 Comp., § 75-1-1.\n\nCross references.— For appropriation of water,seeN.M. Const., art. XVI, § 2.\n\nPurpose of Water Code.— Water Code of 1907 had for its purpose the conservation, protection and development of public waters of state and their application to beneficial uses.State ex rel. Red River Valley Co. v. District Ct., 1935-NMSC-085, 39 N.M. 523, 51 P.2d 239.\n\nWater Code of 1907 was merely declaratory of lawas it had already been established in this jurisdiction by repeated judicial decisions, except that by those decisions the time within which the application was to be made was not any definite period, but a reasonable time, depending, to some extent, on the circumstances of the particular case.Hagerman Irrigation Co. v. McMurry, 1911-NMSC-021, 16 N.M. 172, 113 P. 823.\n\nWater Code of 1907 was merely declaratory of law.— Section was merely declaratory of existing law.Yeo v. Tweedy, 1929-NMSC-033, 34 N.M. 611, 286 P. 970.\n\nNew Mexico has comprehensive system for adjudication of water rights.U.S. ex rel. Acoma & Laguna Indian Pueblos v. Bluewater-Toltec Irrigation Dist., 580 F. Supp. 1434 (D.N.M. 1984), aff'd, 806 F.2d 986 (10th Cir. 1986).\n\nArid-region doctrine, regarding appropriation of water, was modifiedby Water Code of 1907, so that here the right to use of water, both as to volume and periods of annual use, was regulated either by permit of state engineer or decrees of the courts.Harkey v. Smith, 1926-NMSC-011, 31 N.M. 521, 247 P. 550.\n\nWaters affected.— This section expressly limits the operation of chapter 49, Laws 1907, to natural public waters within the territory which are flowing in streams and watercourses; it excludes seepage water.Vanderwork v. Hewes, 1910-NMSC-031, 15 N.M. 439, 110 P. 567.\n\nState controls water use because it does not part with ownership;it only allows a usufructuary right to water.Jicarilla Apache Tribe v. U.S., 657 F.2d 1126 (10th Cir. 1981).\n\n\"Public waters\".— Natural waters flowing in streams and watercourses in New Mexico are public waters subject to adjudication and waters flowing into New Mexico via interstate streams and diverted in New Mexico are public waters of this state.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Luna Irrigation Co., 1969-NMSC-111, 80 N.M. 515, 458 P.2d 590.\n\nSurface waters entering New Mexico after impoundment and subsequent release by Arizona irrigation company were public waters.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Luna Irrigation Co., 1969-NMSC-111, 80 N.M. 515, 458 P.2d 590.\n\nSeasonal flow through ravine.— Where surface water in hilly region or high bluffs seeks outlet through gorge or ravine during rainy season, and by its flow assumes definite and natural channel, such accustomed channel through which water flows possesses attributes of natural watercourse; flow of water need not be continuous, and size of stream is immaterial.Jaquez Ditch Co. v. Garcia, 1912-NMSC-018, 17 N.M. 160, 124 P. 891.\n\nApplicability of adjudication provisions to other waters.— Other waters than those mentioned in this section may be and are public waters, and rights not brought immediately within the administrative provisions of this Water Code may still be subject to its adjudication provisions.El Paso & R.I. Ry. v. District Ct., 1931-NMSC-055, 36 N.M. 94, 8 P.2d 1064.\n\nEstablishment of an existing water right.— To establish an existing water right, a claimant must demonstrate his intent to appropriate the water and show that he has actually diverted the water and applied it to beneficial use.Estate of Boyd v. United States, 2015-NMCA-018, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere plaintiff who claimed an existing water right was not currently diverting or using water to which he claimed a right, but rather based his claim to water rights on the water rights and irrigation work from his predecessor in interest, who diverted irrigation water over one hundred years prior to the existing cause of action, plaintiff failed to establish an existing water right by failing to show that he had actually diverted the water and applied it to beneficial use.Estate of Boyd v. United States, 2015-NMCA-018, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nArtificial waters are not subject to appropriation.Hagerman Irrigation Co. v. East Grand Plains Drainage Dist., 1920-NMSC-008, 25 N.M. 649, 187 P. 555.\n\nAct does not regulate community acequias constructed prior to passagethereof, as to right to change point of diversion from stream into acequias.Pueblo of Isleta v. Tondre, 1913-NMSC-067, 18 N.M. 388, 137 P. 86.\n\nInterstate irrigation project.— Irrigation project upon waters of natural stream running from Colorado into New Mexico, when point of diversion, head gate and about six miles of irrigation ditch were in Colorado, was not within jurisdiction of territorial engineer of New Mexico.Turley v. Furman, 1911-NMSC-030, 16 N.M. 253, 114 P. 278.\n\nRight to take water in individual user.— Right of water user to take water from public stream is a several right owned and possessed by the individual user, although ditch may have been constructed by joint labor.Snow v. Abalos, 1914-NMSC-022, 18 N.M. 681, 140 P. 1044.\n\nProperty right.— Water right is property and held to be real property by most authorities, and ten-year statute of limitations controls actions regarding such right.N.M. Prods. Co. v. N.M. Power Co., 1937-NMSC-04842 N.M. 311, 77 P.2d 634.\n\nStream and underground water rights identical.— Legislature has provided somewhat different administrative procedure for securing appropriator's rights to stream water and underground water, but substantive rights, when obtained, are identical.City of Albuquerque v. Reynolds, 1962-NMSC-173, 71 N.M. 428, 379 P.2d 73.\n\nClaim under Water Code.— Right of one claiming right to use of water for irrigation purposes under Water Code of 1907 does not relate back to earlier date than filing of application, as required by said act.Farmers Dev. Co. v. Rayado Land & Irrigation Co., 1923-NMSC-004, 28 N.M. 357, 213 P. 202.\n\nInitiation of rights prior to passage of Water Code.— Where individual had initiated rights under general law and was prosecuting the same with diligence when the 1907 law went into effect, such right was recognized by and excluded from operation of the 1907 act.Farmers Dev. Co. v. Rayado Land & Irrigation Co., 1923-NMSC-004, 28 N.M. 357, 213 P. 202.\n\nDetermination of beneficial use is a question of fact.Jicarilla Apache Tribe v. U.S., 657 F.2d 1126 (10th Cir. 1981).\n\nBeneficial uses may include recreation, fish and wildlife purposes.— The holding ofJicarilla Apache Tribe v. U.S., 657 F.2d 1126 (10th Cir. 1981), does not broadly stand for the proposition that using San Juan Chama Project water for recreation, fish and wildlife purposes is not \"beneficial\" under federal and state law.Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. Keys, 333 F.3d 1109 (10th Cir. 2003).\n\nProtection of endangered species is a beneficial use.— Diverting San Juan Chama Project water to prevent jeopardy to an endangered species of minnow is a \"beneficial\" use under New Mexico law.Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. Keys, 333 F.3d 1109 (10th Cir. 2003).\n\nEquitable apportionment is the doctrine of federal common law that governs disputes between statesconcerning their rights to use the water of an interstate stream. When both states recognize the doctrine of prior appropriation, priority becomes the \"guiding principle\" in an allocation between competing states, but state law is not controlling.Colo. v. N.M., 459 U.S. 176, 103 S. Ct. 539, 74 L. Ed. 2d 348 (1982),reh'g denied, 459 U.S. 1229, 103 S. Ct. 1418, 75 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1983).\n\nIn the determination of an equitable apportionment of the water of the Vermejo river between Colorado and New Mexico the rule of priority is not the sole criterion. While the equities supporting the protection of established, senior uses are substantial, it is also appropriate to consider additional factors relevant to a just apportionment, such as the conservation measures available to both states and the balance of harm and benefit that might result from a diversion sought by Colorado.Colo. v. N.M., 459 U.S. 176, 103 S. Ct. 539, 74 L. Ed. 2d 348 (1982),reh'g denied, 459 U.S. 1229, 103 S. Ct. 1418, 75 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1983).\n\nEquitable apportionment applies to claim of diversion for future uses.— The flexible doctrine of equitable apportionment clearly extends to a state's claim to divert water for future uses. Whether such a diversion should be permitted will turn on an examination of all factors relevant to a just apportionment.Colo. v. N.M., 459 U.S. 176, 103 S. Ct. 539, 74 L. Ed. 2d 348 (1982),reh'g denied, 459 U.S. 1229, 103 S. Ct. 1418, 75 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1983).\n\nPueblo rights doctrine.— The \"pueblo rights doctrine,\" providing that any municipality tracing its origins to a Spanish or Mexican pueblo grant, particularly after 1789, has a prior and paramount right to all waters of nonnavigable streams flowing through or by the pueblo to the extent necessary to serve its future growth, is invalid.Cartwright v. Pub. Serv. Co., 1958-NMSC-134, 66 N.M. 64, 343 P.2d 654,overruled byState ex rel. Martinez v. City of Las Vegas, 2004-NMSC-009, 135 N.M. 375, 89 P.3d 47.\n\nWhat law governs water rights.— Provisions of New Mexico constitution, statutory law of New Mexico and case law of federal, territorial and state courts govern acquisition of water rights of all parties including federal government, state game commission and individual defendants.U.S. v. Ballard, 184 F. Supp. 1 (D.N.M. 1960).\n\nJurisdiction of suit.— Where water rights of stream system had not been adjudicated under Water Code of 1907, but were more than twenty years old when code was enacted, district court had jurisdiction of suit for obstruction of flow and appropriation of waters of creek.N.M. Prods. Co. v. N.M. Power Co., 1937-NMSC-048, 42 N.M. 311, 77 P.2d 634.\n\nTrial court erred in dismissing suitfor failure to exhaust administrative remedies, where parties sought adjudication of their respectively claimed rights to use of waters of a draw; fact that neither party had secured a permit from state to beneficially use the waters did not necessarily prevent acquisition by either or both of rights to beneficial use by appropriation, nor did it necessarily prevent acquisition of rights to use of these waters by either as against the other. If claimed rights were acquired pursuant to common-law appropriations prior to the enactment of state's first water code, those rights were in no way dependent on existence of application to or permit from state engineer.May v. Torres, 1974-NMSC-018, 86 N.M. 62, 519 P.2d 298.\n\nEffect of former law.— General law for appropriation of water for the arid states was not affected by the enactment of Laws 1905, chs. 102 and 104 (now repealed and superseded).Farmers Dev. Co. v. Rayado Land & Irrigation Co., 1923-NMSC-004, 28 N.M. 357, 213 P. 202.\n\nLaws 1905, ch. 104 (now superseded) was permissive in character, applying only to such claims to the right of use of water as were initiated under it; it was not exclusive and did not preclude a claim under the general law, nor deprive a claimant of the doctrine of relation.Farmers Dev. Co. v. Rayado Land & Irrigation Co., 1923-NMSC-004, 28 N.M. 357, 213 P. 202, explainedState ex rel. Reynolds v. Mendenhall, 1961-NMSC-083, 68 N.M. 467, 362 P.2d 998.\n\nAccess to public waters.— A private landowner cannot prevent persons from fishing in a public stream that flows across the landowner's property, provided the public stream is accessible without trespass across privately owned adjacent lands. 2014 Op. Att'y Gen. 14-04.\n\nTaking of sand.— If state or its contractor takes sand from sand bar in middle of Chama river near highway project, it should obtain consent of abutting property owners. 1938 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 38-1902.\n\nActual appropriation as better right.— Prior actual appropriation of water to beneficial use, open and visible, will give better right to the water than could be obtained under approved application to state engineer for right to appropriate. 1914 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 14-1271.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"An Institutional Framework for a Water Market in the Elephant Butte Irrigation District,\" see 49 Nat.

      "text": "Beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure and the limit of the right to the use of water, and all waters appropriated for irrigation purposes, except as otherwise provided by written contract between the owner of the land and the owner of any ditch, reservoir or other works for the storage or conveyance of water, shall be appurtenant to specified lands owned by the person, firm or corporation having the right to use the water, so long as the water can be beneficially used thereon, or until the severance of such right from the land in the manner hereinafter provided in this article. Priority in time shall give the better right. In all cases of claims to the use of water initiated prior to March 19, 1907, the right shall relate back to the initiation of the claim, upon the diligent prosecution to completion of the necessary surveys and construction for the application of the water to a beneficial use. All claims to the use of water initiated thereafter shall relate back to the date of the receipt of an application therefor in the office of the territorial or state engineer, subject to compliance with the provisions of this article, and the rules and regulations established thereunder.\n\nHistory:Laws 1907, ch. 49, § 2; Code 1915, § 5655; C.S. 1929, § 151-102; 1941 Comp., § 77-102; 1953 Comp., § 75-1-2.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The term \"this article,\" as used by the 1915 Code compilers, presumably refers to Code 1915, ch. 114, art. I, the provisions of which are presently compiled as 19-7-26, 72-1-1, 72-1-2, 72-1-5, 72-2-1 to 72-2-7, 72-2-9, 72-2-10, 72-3-1 to 72-3-5, 72-4-1, 72-4-13, 72-4-15, 72-4-17 to 72-4-19, 72-5-1 to 72-5-4, 72-5-6 to 72-5-24, 72-5-26 to 72-5-31, 72-5-33, 72-7-1 to 72-7-3, 72-8-1 to 72-8-6 and 72-9-1 to 72-9-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nCross references.— For severing of water rights from land,see72-5-23 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor beneficial use of water in streams,seeN.M. Const., art. XVI, §§ 1 to 3.\n\nDeed silent as to water rights.— Where grantor divided a parcel of land into fifteen adjoining lots and conveyed a lot to each of grantor's children; each deed granted the grantee the right to water from a well located on one of the lots; defendant acquired title to one of the lots from an heir of grantor; the deed to defendant contained no language regarding water rights or the well; and there was no evidence that the land acquired by defendant was used for irrigation, defendant did not have a right to use water from the well because the deed to defendant did not expressly grant water rights.Roybal v. Lujan de la Fuente, 2009-NMCA-114, 147 N.M. 193, 218 P.3d 879.\n\nWater right developed under mining lease.— Where a mining lease was silent on the subject of the ownership of water rights developed under the lease and on the subject of whether the lessee was the agent of the lessor for purposes of developing water rights, water rights developed by the lessee were owned by the lessee.Hydro Res. Corp. v. Gray, 2007-NMSC-061, 143 N.M. 142, 173 P.3d 749.\n\nWater rights are separate and distinct from the ownership of landand, except for irrigation water rights, are not appurtenant to land.Hydro Res. Corp. v. Gray, 2007-NMSC-061, 143 N.M. 142, 173 P.3d 749.\n\nProperty rights incident to water rights.— New Mexico does not recognize a limited livestock forage right implicit in a vested water right or a limited livestock forage right implicit in a right-of-way for the maintenance and enjoyment of a vested water right.Walker v. United States, 2007-NMSC-038, 142 N.M. 45, 162 P.3d 882.\n\nEffect of state engineer's denial of protest.— Service of decision denying protest on attorney rather than on protestant, where protestant's well was mentioned in application to change use of existing rights, did not adjudicate protestant's rights to the well.Garbagni v. Metro. Inv., Inc., 1990-NMCA-070, 110 N.M. 436, 796 P.2d 1132, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 330, 795 P.2d 1022.\n\nSection incorporated doctrine of relation into statutory lawaffecting surface waters.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Mendenhall, 1961-NMSC-083, 68 N.M. 467, 362 P.2d 998.\n\nDoctrine of relation.— The doctrine of relation, as it applies to claims to water under the western concept of prior appropriation embodies two features: (1) embarking in good faith on a project to appropriate water; and (2) consummating the project without unnecessary delay by exercising reasonable diligence in constructing facilities, diverting water, and completing the appropriation by applying the water to beneficial use. Meeting these requirements, a would-be appropriator attains a vested right to use the water with a priority date measured as of the time the project commenced.State ex rel. Office of State Eng'r v. Gray, 2021-NMCA-066.\n\nDoctrine of relation applied.— In a case that arose as an inter se proceeding within the Lower Rio Grande general stream adjudication initiated by the state of New Mexico in 1996, and where, in 2014, cross-appellants asked the adjudication court to establish an expedited inter se proceeding to address water rights claimed by appellants at the copper flat mine (the mine) near Hillsboro, New Mexico, and where appellants, after the expedited inter se proceeding was established, filed their statement of claims asserting that their predecessors in interest had placed 1,019 acre-feet of water to beneficial use before the mine became operational and an additional 1,267 acre-feet of water during the time the mine was in operation and requested entry of an order recognizing a vested interest in approximately 2,300 acre-feet with priority dates starting in 1975 and, alleging that certain appellants intended to recommence operations at the mine as soon as all permit and regulatory requirements were met, asked the adjudication court to declare that they were entitled to a reasonable amount of time to develop an additional 5,200 acre-feet of water rights in accordance with the mining plan created by their predecessors in interest, the adjudication court did not err in refusing to recognize appellants' claimed right underMendenhall, because the facts and circumstances of the case support the adjudication court's legal conclusion that the predecessors' actions extinguished any inchoate water rights underMendenhall, and, after buying their predecessors' interest in water rights, appellants did essentially nothing to put any water to beneficial use. Under the doctrine of relation, it was appellants' obligation to put water to beneficial use within a reasonable time, but the decades-long delay in putting the claimed water to beneficial use extinguished any inchoate water rights appellants may have owned.State ex rel. Office of State Eng'r v. Gray, 2021-NMCA-066.\n\nFailure to prove abandonment of vested water rights in inter se proceeding.— In a case that arose as an inter se proceeding within the Lower Rio Grande general stream adjudication initiated by the state of New Mexico in 1996, and where, in 2014, cross-appellants asked the adjudication court to establish an expedited inter se proceeding to address water rights claimed by appellants at the copper flat mine (the mine) near Hillsboro, New Mexico, and where appellants, after the expedited inter se proceeding was established, filed their statement of claims asserting that their predecessors in interest had placed 1,019 acre-feet of water to beneficial use before the mine became operational and an additional 1,267 acre-feet of water during the time the mine was in operation and requested entry of an order recognizing a vested interest in approximately 2,300 acre-feet with priority dates starting in 1975 and, alleging that certain appellants intended to recommence operations at the mine as soon as all permit and regulatory requirements were met, asked the adjudication court to declare that they were entitled to a reasonable amount of time to develop an additional 5,200 acre-feet of water rights in accordance with the mining plan created by their predecessors in interest, the adjudication court did not err in concluding that appellants did not abandoned their vested rights in the water attributable to the mining project, because the facts of the case support the adjudication court's finding that appellants sought to revive the mine and protect the vested rights they purchased from their predecessors in interest.State ex rel.

In the event the interstate stream commission determines that the total Pecos river rights it has purchased with appropriations made by the legislature for that purpose are in excess of those rights permanently needed for compliance with New Mexico's obligations under the Pecos River Compact, then the commission shall offer the excess land with appurtenant water rights or rights to the delivery of water first to the original owner at the original point of diversion and for the original place and purpose of use. Lands shall be offered for sale in the order in which they were acquired by:\n\n(1) sending a written offer to sell to the last known address of the owner by certified mail, which offer shall remain open for at least sixty days from the date of the mailing;\n\n(2) including in the offer to sell a notice that if the offer is not accepted by the original owner within a stated time pursuant to this subsection, the offer will be deemed rejected and automatically withdrawn and made available for purchase at the current market price; and\n\n(3) depositing the revenue from sales into the New Mexico irrigation works construction fund.\n\nHistory:Laws 2002, ch. 94, § 2.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2002, ch. 94 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M.

In addition to the land with appurtenant water rights or rights to the delivery of water acquired pursuant to the provisions of Section 72-1-2.4 NMSA 1978, the interstate stream commission may expend funds for the purchase of water rights or rights to the delivery of water without acquiring the surface of the land to which the water rights or rights to the delivery of water are appurtenant. No such expenditure shall be made unless the commission has entered into contracts with the governing bodies of the Carlsbad irrigation district, the Pecos valley artesian conservancy district and the Fort Sumner irrigation district that specify the actions the parties agree will be taken or avoided to ensure that the expenditures will be effective toward permanent compliance with New Mexico's obligations under the Pecos River Compact pursuant to Section 72-15-19 NMSA 1978 and the amended decree.\n\nB.

If the interstate stream commission determines that ownership of all or any part of the surface of land acquired by the commission pursuant to Section 72-1-2.4 NMSA 1978 is not necessary or desirable, the commission may offer the land for sale, in accordance with state law. The land may be offered for sale by sending a written offer to sell, by certified mail, to the party from whom the commission purchased the land at the party's last known address. The offer shall remain open for at least sixty days from the date of mailing. The offer shall include a notice that, if the offer is not accepted by the prior owner within the time stated pursuant to this section, the offer will be deemed rejected and automatically withdrawn and the land may be made available for purchase by third parties in accordance with state law.

State Engineer v. San Juan Agricultural Water Users Ass'n, 2018-NMCA-053, cert. granted.\n\nThe district court did not err in determining the proper measure of reservation water.— Where the Navajo Nation, the United States, and the state of New Mexico reached an agreement settling the Navajo Nation's claims to water in the San Juan river basin, and where federal legislation to approve and implement the settlement agreement was enacted by congress, and where the New Mexico legislature appropriated funds to pay New Mexico's cost of the settlement agreement and authorized the New Mexico state engineer to seek judicial approval regarding the state's share of the water, and where the district court approved the settlement agreement, concluding that the settlement agreement was fair, adequate, reasonable, and consistent with the public interests as well as all applicable laws, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the proper measure of reservation water should not be limited to only an amount of water sufficient to support the pastoral life often contemplated in the nineteenth century, but rather, but should be calculated to provide the tribes with water in quantities sufficient to promote survival and the success of the reservations.State ex rel.
