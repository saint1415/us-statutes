The legislature hereby determines that:\n\n(1) the production of minerals in New Mexico at times requires the diversion and associated treatment of large quantities of water;\n\n(2) the diversion of water to permit mineral production is affected with a public interest;\n\n(3) existing principles of prior appropriation, beneficial use and impairment of water rights, when applied to the diversion of water to permit mineral production, may cause severe economic hardship and impact to persons engaged in mineral production, to the owners of water rights and to the citizens of New Mexico;\n\n(4) such hardship and impact are threats to the public health, safety and welfare and can be averted or minimized through the operation of the Mine Dewatering Act; and\n\n(5) state regulation in matters relating to the diversion of water to implement mineral production is necessary to avert or minimize such threats to the public health, safety and welfare.\n\nB. The purpose of the Mine Dewatering Act is to promote maximum economic development of mineral resources while ensuring that such development does not impair existing water rights.\n\nHistory:Laws 1980, ch. 148, § 2.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"New Mexico's Mine Dewatering Act: The Search for Rehoboth,\" see 20 Nat.
