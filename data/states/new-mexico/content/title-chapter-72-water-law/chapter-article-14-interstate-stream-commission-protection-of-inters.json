An appointed member of the interstate stream commission shall not have changed party registration in the two years preceding the member's appointment in such a manner that the member's prior party registration would cause one political party to have more than five members. A member of the commission shall not continue to serve on the commission if the member changes party registration after the date of appointment in such a manner as to cause one political party to have more than five members.\n\nD. The appointed members shall serve for staggered terms of four years; provided that of the initial members, two members shall serve for one year, two members shall serve for two years, two members shall serve for three years and two members shall serve for four years. Initial terms shall be decided by drawing lots.\n\nE.

Current members who meet the qualifications of the positions specified in Section 72-14-1 NMSA 1978 may be appointed for new terms. A member appointed before January 1, 2024 pursuant to this act shall take office immediately, serve the remainder of the year and serve for a term beginning January 1, 2024 and ending December 31 in the year for that position as determined by lot in accordance with Section 72-14-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, inserted the third sentence.\n\nThe 1982 amendmentdeleted the former last sentence, which read \"The commission shall, for purposes of administration, execute all functions vested in it within the division of water resources.\"\n\nConstruction in pari materia.— This section creates an agency with authority to institute, in the name of the state, legal proceedings invoking state's power of eminent domain for conservation, protection and development of public waters of the state, and their application to beneficial uses and because the Water Code (Section 72-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.) had the latter purposes, the statutes must be deemed in pari materia.State ex rel. Red River Valley Co. v. Dist. Ct., 1935-NMSC-085, 39 N.M. 523, 51 P.2d 239.\n\nPublic use of private property.— Taking private property by commission for impounding waters of river by dam or reservoir is for public use.State ex rel. Red River Valley Co. v. Dist. Ct., 1935-NMSC-085, 39 N.M. 523, 51 P.2d 239.\n\nRemedying past failures to perform.— There is nothing in the nature of compacts generally or of this compact in particular that counsels against rectifying a failure to perform in the past as well as ordering future performance called for by the 1949 Pecos River Compact.Tex. v. N.M., 482 U.S. 124, 107 S. Ct. 2279, 96 L. Ed. 2d 105 (1987).\n\nThe matter of remedying past water shortages caused by New Mexico's underdeliveries was returned to a special master for such further proceedings as he deemed necessary and for his ensuing recommendation as to whether New Mexico should be allowed to elect a monetary remedy and, if so, to suggest the size of the payment and other terms that the state must satisfy.Tex. v. N.M., 482 U.S. 124, 107 S. Ct. 2279, 96 L. Ed. 2d 105 (1987).\n\nGood faith belief in compliance.— New Mexico's good faith belief that it was complying with the 1949 Pecos River Compact would not permit the state to escape liability for what had been adjudicated to be past failures to perform its duties under the compact.Tex. v. N.M., 482 U.S. 124, 107 S. Ct. 2279, 96 L. Ed. 2d 105 (1987).\n\nCommission is empowered to take over and maintain Conchas dam project.1936 Op. Att'y Gen.

Red River Valley Co. v. Dist. Ct., 1935-NMSC-085, 39 N.M. 523, 51 P.2d 239.\n\nThis section gives extremely broad powers to commissionto carry out programs designed to meet the purposes of developing, conserving or protecting water and stream systems of this state. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-184.\n\nAuthority of commission and use of funds appropriated to it.— Laws 1959, ch. 349, appropriates to the commission a sum of money for, among other things, acquisition of rights-of-way to carry out programs for alleviation of salinity conditions prevailing in the Pecos river, authorized by the congress of United States to be carried out by the secretary of the interior. Part of this legislation was that New Mexico must provide rights-of-way needed for carrying out the work proposed. It must be assumed that the legislature knew the purpose and effect of the federal legislation and with such knowledge authorized expending sums necessary within available appropriations for acquisition of needed rights-of-way. Commission has authority to enter into an agreement with the state of Texas or its agency, looking toward repayment to commission of a part or all of the costs of such rights-of-way. Upon receipt of such repayment, however, under existing legislation, funds received must be deposited in the general fund. Commission may accept funds from either the state of Texas or a subordinate agency or instrumentality thereof for the purpose of acquisition of rights-of-way, but such funds would be in the nature of advance reimbursement; that is to say, such funds would have to be deposited in the general fund and the appropriated funds available to commission actually used for the purchase. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-184.\n\nPurchase of building for state engineer.— Where contemplated purchase will house entire state engineer's office in Roswell and will result in administrative benefits directly to state engineer's office, proposal to purchase building for the state engineer's office would be diverting funds, at least in part, for purposes other than those for which the grant was originally made. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-112.\n\nAppointment of legislator denied.— Position of commissioner on Pecos river compact commission is civil office within terms of state constitution and, therefore, legislator may not be appointed to that office during term of his legislative position. 1969 Op.

The interstate stream commission shall ensure that public participation and public input are integrated throughout the planning process. The interstate stream commission shall convene water planners and stakeholders from diverse constituencies to advise it and the office of the state engineer on the state water plan, including statewide policies, priorities, goals and objectives for the plan, issues of statewide concern and strategies for implementation of the plan. The interstate stream commission shall also ensure that representatives of the stakeholder groups affected by various plan components will participate in the development of those plan components. Members of the interstate stream commission and water trust board shall be notified of and are welcome to participate in all aspects of the planning process.\n\nG. After public review and comment, the state water plan developed in conformance with this section is subject to adoption by the interstate stream commission. Following its adoption, the state water plan shall be presented to the interim legislative committee that studies water and natural resources.\n\nH. The state water plan shall be periodically reviewed, updated and amended in response to changing conditions. At a minimum a review shall be undertaken every five years.\n\nI. Nothing in the state water plan shall be construed to permit the granting or the condemnation of water rights.\n\nJ. Nothing in the state water plan shall be construed to determine, abridge or affect the water rights of Indian nations, tribes or pueblos.\n\nHistory:Laws 2003, ch. 131, § 1 and Laws 2003, ch. 137, § 1.\n\nDuplicate laws.— Laws 2003, ch. 131, § 1 and Laws 2003, ch. 137, § 1, both effective June 20, 2003, enacted identical new sections.\n\nCross references.— For the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973,see16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.\n\nPueblo rights doctrine unduly interfereswith the state's regulation of water rights.State ex rel.

The principal of and interest on revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund to be provided for such payment. Revenue bonds shall mature at such time, not more than fifty years from their date, as may be fixed by the resolution, but may be made redeemable before maturity at the option of the state, to be exercised by the commission, at such price and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the commission prior to the issuance of the bonds. The commission shall determine the rate of interest not in excess of the maximum net effective interest rate permitted by the Public Securities Act [6-14-1 to 6-14-3 NMSA 1978] or the Public Securities Short-Term Interest Rate Act [6-18-1 to 6-18-16 NMSA 1978] on such bonds, the time of payment of such interest, the form of the bonds and the manner of executing the bonds, and shall fix the denomination of the bonds and the place of payment of principal and interest thereof.\n\nB.

In case any of the officers whose signatures appear on the bonds cease to be officers before the delivery of the bonds, the signatures shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, as if the officers had remained in office until delivery. All the bonds are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments. The bonds shall not constitute or be a debt, liability or obligation of the state, and shall be secured only by the revenues of such works and the funds received from the sale or disposal of water and from the operation, lease, sale or other disposition of the works, property and facilities to be acquired out of the proceeds of such bonds and, if so pledged by the commission, from income credited to the permanent reservoirs for irrigation purposes income fund and the improvement of Rio Grande income fund.\n\nC. Provisions may be made for the registration of any of the bonds in the resolution authorizing the bonds.

The state investment officer is authorized to invest the permanent funds of the state in the bonds. The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of a project and shall be used in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the commission may provide.\n\nD. If the proceeds of the bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, are less than the cost of the project, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the bonds, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same project. If the proceeds of bonds issued for any such project exceed the cost of the project, the surplus shall be paid into the debt service fund provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the commission may issue temporary bonds exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. Such bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified and required by Sections 72-14-9 through 72-14-28 NMSA 1978 or by the constitution of New Mexico.\n\nE. Each resolution providing for the issuance of bonds shall set forth a project for which the bonds are to be issued, and the bonds authorized by each such resolution shall constitute a separate series. The bonds of each series shall be identified by a series number or letter and may be sold and delivered at one time or from time to time.\n\nF. Revenue bonds issued by the commission for obtaining hydrographic surveys used by the state engineer shall mature not later than ten years from their date of issuance. The commission shall issue bonds for hydrographic surveys in a total amount not exceeding four million dollars ($4,000,000) and in amounts not to exceed two million dollars ($2,000,000) in any fiscal year commencing July 1, 1998.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 75-34-13, enacted by Laws 1955, ch. 266, § 5; 1957, ch. 63, § 1; 1997, ch. 241, § 6; 1997, ch. 246, § 6.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective June 20, 1997, rewrote this section to the extent that a detailed comparison is impracticable.\n\nLaws 1997, ch. 241, § 6 and Laws 1997, ch. 246, § 6, both effective June 20, 1997, enacted identical amendments to this section.

To view the session laws in their entirety,seethe 2019 session laws onNMOneSource.com.\n\nThe nature of the difference between the amendments is that Laws 2019, ch. 62, § 9, made a distribution from the New Mexico irrigation works construction fund to the forest land protection revolving fund, and revised certain statutory citations, and Laws 2019, ch. 169, § 2, required an annual distribution of two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000) from the New Mexico irrigation works construction fund to the acequia and community ditch infrastructure fund, and made certain technical and conforming amendments.\n\nLaws 2019, ch. 62, § 9,effective June 14, 2019, made a distribution from the New Mexico irrigation works construction fund to the forest land protection revolving fund, and revised certain statutory citations; added Subsection B and new subsection designations \"C\" and \"D\"; and in Subsection D, after \"project from\", added \"the New Mexico irrigation works\", and after \"for the purposes provided\", added \"in Sections 72-14-9 through 72-14-28 NMSA 1978\".\n\nLaws 2019, ch. 169, § 2,effective July 1, 2020, required an annual distribution of two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000) from the New Mexico irrigation works construction fund to the acequia and community ditch infrastructure fund, and made certain technical and conforming amendments; added new subsection designation \"A.\"; in Subsection A, after \"Section\", deleted \"75-34-19 New Mexico Statutes Annotated, 1953 Compilation, (being Laws 1955, Chapter 266, Section 11)\" and added \"72-14-19 NMSA 1978\"; added new Subsection B and new subsection designations \"C.\" and \"D.\"; in Subsection C, after \"Section\", deleted \"75-34-11 New Mexico Statutes Annotated, 1953 Compilation, (being Laws 1955, Chapter 266, Section 3)\" and added \"72-14-11 NMSA 1978\", and after \"Sections\", deleted \"75-34-9 to 75-34-27 New Mexico Statutes, 1953 Compilation (being Laws 1955 Chapter 266, Sections 1 to 19)\" and added \"72-14-19 through 72-14-28 NMSA 1978\"; and in Subsection D, after \"any project from\", deleted \"said\" and added \"the New Mexico irrigation works\", and after \"provided\", added \"in Sections 72-14-9 through 72-14-28 NMSA 1978\".\n\nConstruction of \"reservoir,\" \"establishment\".— Irrigating lands of New Mexico is the prime objective. To this end, establishment of artificial reservoirs and utilization of water stored naturally is necessary. The grant was not intended to restrict word \"establish\" to construction of reservoirs or to qualify word \"reservoirs\" by adjective \"artificial\" as opposed to the utilization of waters stored naturally. There is no reason for distinguishing between waters stored naturally and waters taken directly from their natural source. A reasonable meaning of the restriction in the grant is that it is to provide funds for establishment of permanent sources of water for irrigation purposes. The term \"establishment\" as used in the Ferguson Act of June 21, 1898, 30 Stat. 434, includes permanent regulation of use of water stored naturally or coming directly from natural sources, as well as establishment of other permanent reservoirs.State ex rel. Interstate Stream Comm'n v. Reynolds, 1963-NMSC-023, 71 N.M. 389, 378 P.2d 622.\n\nIrrigation funds.— Under Sections 19-1-17 and 19-1-18 NMSA 1978, there were established permanent reservoirs for irrigation purposes, permanent fund, and permanent reservoirs for irrigation purposes, income fund. Subsequently, this section establishes the New Mexico irrigation works construction fund, to consist of the income creditable to the income fund above noted and such other moneys as may be appropriated thereto by the state legislature.State ex rel. Interstate Stream Comm'n v. Reynolds, 1963-NMSC-023, 71 N.M. 389, 378 P.2d 622.\n\nAppropriations out of trust lands income fund.— Appropriations made to state engineer from irrigation works construction fund which consisted solely of moneys from the permanent reservoirs for irrigation purposes income fund accruing from the trust lands set aside by congress under the Ferguson Act of June 21, 1898, 30 Stat. 434, are within fundamental purpose and reasonable meaning of the trust grant \"for the establishment of permanent water reservoirs for irrigation purposes.\"State ex rel. Interstate Stream Comm'n v. Reynolds, 1963-NMSC-023, 71 N.M. 389, 378 P.2d 622.\n\nUse of underground water for irrigation.— Congress has expressed no preference for surface reservoir as against one underground. If underground water can, by pumping or by utilizing artesian pressure, be made to serve the ends of irrigation, such water comes within the language of the trust as the waters of surface streams. If it were proposed to construct a huge surface reservoir, to be supplied wholly by pumping from underground sources, the practicability of the scheme might be doubted; but it would be difficult to show its illegality - the only respect in which it may be questioned. To discover and make available an underground basin serves the same purpose, is practicable and is well within the broad meaning of establishment. The same practical methods of making available waters of the Pecos river to serve the ends of irrigation apply as well to the utilization of surface waters from their sources and come within the broad meaning of establishment.State ex rel.

Reynolds, 1963-NMSC-023, 71 N.M. 389, 378 P.2d 622.\n\nLoan to an artesian conservancy districtof funds which would in turn be loaned to landowners for water conservation work within district is authorized under this act. 1958 Op.
