      "heading": "Appointment; removal; qualifications; duties; office; private practice prohibited",
      "text": "There shall be a \"state engineer\" who shall be a technically qualified and registered professional engineer under the Engineering and Land Surveying Practice Act [Chapter 61, Article 23 NMSA 1978] and shall be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the senate. He shall hold office for the term of two years or until his successor has been appointed and has qualified. He is subject to removal only for cause. He has general supervision of waters of the state and of the measurement, appropriation, distribution thereof and such other duties as required. The salary of the state engineer shall be set by the governor, and he shall receive necessary traveling expenses while away from his office in the discharge of official duties pursuant to the provisions of the Per Diem and Mileage Act [10-8-1 to 10-8-8 NMSA 1978]. The office of the state engineer shall be located at the seat of government. He shall not engage in any private practice.\n\nHistory:Laws 1907, ch. 49, § 4; Code 1915, § 5657; Laws 1919, ch. 46, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 151-104; Laws 1937, ch. 178, § 1; 1947, ch. 142, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 77-201; 1953 Comp., § 75-2-1; Laws 1971, ch. 234, § 10; 1977, ch. 254, § 92; 1982, ch. 10, § 3.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 2005, ch. 114, § 1, effective June 17, 2005, provided that the $100,000 appropriated in Item (75) of Section 5 of Chapter 114 of Laws 2004 from the game protection fund to the state engineer for administration of Eagle Nest lake and reservoir shall not be expended for that purpose but shall revert to the game protection fund.\n\nCross references.— For right of state engineer to enter private property,see72-8-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor investigation of water supply for state lands,see19-5-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor reports from electrical irrigation districts,see73-12-12 NMSA 1978.\n\nSubject matter jurisdiction.— The state engineer has subject matter jurisdiction to review an application irrespective of the applicant making specific reference to, or invocation of, any statutory section in the application, so long as the application seeks permission to do something within the statutory and regulatory authority of the state engineer. It is not the invocation of a statute that confers the right of the state engineer to review an application, but that the statute creates a procedure by which proposed actions are reviewed in specific ways and for specific purposes.\n\nApplicants have the burden to fulfill the statutory requirements for completing an adequate application and notice of intent to divert, but are not required to invoke a specific statute.Carangelo v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth., 2014-NMCA-032, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-002.\n\nImposition of conditions for grant lawful.— Adoption by state engineer of the only known plan to avoid impairment of existing rights by requiring that surface rights be retired to the extent necessary to protect prior stream appropriators as a condition of the granting city's application to appropriate underground water from the Rio Grande basin, was within his lawful power and authority, and was not an attempt to exercise jurisdiction over Rio Grande stream water.City of Albuquerque v. Reynolds, 1962-NMSC-173, 71 N.M. 428, 379 P.2d 73.\n\nEngineer's jurisdiction does not extend to seepage waterfrom unknown sources.Vanderwork v. Hewes, 1910-NMSC-031, 15 N.M. 439, 110 P. 567.\n\nEngineer's action presumed correct.— On appeal supreme court would presume state engineer's action in declaring Rio Grande valley from Colorado line to Elephant Butte Dam and underground water basin was correct.State v. Myers, 1958-NMSC-059, 64 N.M. 186, 326 P.2d 1075.\n\nCourts not ousted of jurisdiction.— State statutes which confer upon state engineer general supervision over state waters and their appropriation and distribution do not oust courts of jurisdiction to protect individual rights in use of water; hence, court retained jurisdiction of suit by irrigation district for injunction against unlawful appropriation of water by riparian owners above district's works and reservoirs.Carlsbad Irrigation Dist. v. Ford, 1942-NMSC-042, 46 N.M. 335, 128 P.2d 1047.\n\nAdjudication suit to determine all claims to water's use in given stream system.— The object of an adjudication suit is to determine all claims to the use of the water in a given stream system in order to facilitate the administration of unappropriated waters and to aid in the distribution of waters already appropriated.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Pecos Valley Artesian Conservancy Dist., 1983-NMSC-044, 99 N.M. 699, 663 P.2d 358.\n\nDecree not erroneous.— Where decree enjoined riparian owners from appropriating waters above irrigation district's reservoirs and works but also provided that nothing should prevent such owners from applying to state engineer for water rights, it indicated sufficiently that upon a proper showing owners' application for modification of the decree would be heard by the court, and was not erroneous under contention that it prevented any use of flood waters.Carlsbad Irrigation Dist. v. Ford, 1942-NMSC-042, 46 N.M. 335, 128 P.2d 1047.\n\nRecusal was not necessary.— Where applicant applied for a permit to divert native Rio Grande water, to which applicant had no appropriative right, to enable applicant to carry its San Juan-Chama water into the applicant's water treatment plant for processing and distribution through applicant's drinking water project; the state engineer, prior to the state engineer's appointment as state engineer, acting as a district director in the office of the state engineer, attended an information meeting about the application; after the application was filed, the state engineer and the staff in the office of the state engineer assisted applicant in drafting a public notice of the application, but did not assist in the drafting of the application; the state engineer reviewed the findings and recommendations of the hearing officer in the state engineer's capacity as state engineer and authorized the issuance of a permit to applicant; and there was no evidence that the state engineer prejudged the merits of the application, recusal by the state engineer was not necessary.Carangelo v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth., 2014-NMCA-032, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-002.\n\nDeclaration of underground waters as public.— Once state engineer determines that waters mentioned in Section 72-12-1 NMSA 1978 have reasonably ascertainable boundaries he may declare by rule that same are public waters subject to administrative jurisdiction of his office. 1949 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 49-5185.\n\nOrdering distribution by mayordomo.— Under this section the state engineer has authority to order any mayordomo who is not fairly and equitably distributing purchased water to desist from doing so and, if necessary, to go into court to force him to do so in case the user cannot afford to take such legal action. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5734.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment onMathers v. Texaco, Inc.,77 N.M. 239, 421 P.2d 771 (1966), see 7 Nat.

Retroactive approval by the state engineer of applications for extension of time is permissible.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Aamodt, 1990-NMSC-099, 111 N.M. 4, 800 P.2d 1061.\n\nPassing upon appropriation applications.— With respect to protest to applications to appropriate water, required by regulations of state engineer, no distinction should be made between the government reclamation service and other persons in the practice as to passing upon such applications. 1915 Op.

      "text": "A. The legislature recognizes that the adjudication process is slow, the need for water administration is urgent, compliance with interstate compacts is imperative and the state engineer has authority to administer water allocations in accordance with the water right priorities recorded with or declared or otherwise available to the state engineer.\n\nB. The state engineer shall adopt rules for priority administration to ensure that authority is exercised:\n\n(1) so as not to interfere with a future or pending adjudication;\n\n(2) so as to create no impairment of water rights, other than what is required to enforce priorities; and\n\n(3) so as to create no increased depletions.\n\nC. The state engineer shall adopt rules based on the appropriate hydrologic models to promote expedited marketing and leasing of water in those areas affected by priority administration. The rules shall be consistent with the rights, remedies and criteria established by law for proceedings for water use leasing and for changes in point of diversion, place of use and purpose of use of water rights. The rules shall not apply to acequias or community ditches or to water rights served by an acequia or community ditch.\n\nD. Nothing in this section shall affect the partial final decree and settlement agreement as may be entered in the Carlsbad irrigation district project offer phase ofState of New Mexico ex rel. State Engineer v. Lewis, et al., Nos. 20294 and 22600 (N.M. 5th Jud. Dist.).\n\nHistory:Laws 2003, ch. 63, § 1.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2003, ch. 63 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 23, was effective June 20, 2003, 90 days after adjournment of the legislature.\n\nPriority administration regulations are constitutional.— The state engineer's active water resources management regulations, 19.25.13.1-.50 (12/30/2004), which provide for the administration of water resources according to administrative interim priority determinations, do not violate constitutional separation of powers principles or due process and are not impermissibly vague.Tri-State Gen. & Trans. Ass'n., Inc., v. D'Antonio, 2012-NMSC-039, 289 P.3d 1232,rev'g, 2011-NMCA-015, 149 N.M. 394, 249 P.3d 932.\n\nDelegation of new authority to the state engineer.— Section 72-2-9.1 NMSA 1978 is a delegation of new regulatory authority to the state engineer to carry out priority administration responsibilities and is not limited by the state engineer's existing authority in Section 72-2-9 NMSA 1978.Tri-State Gen. & Trans. Ass'n., Inc., v. D'Antonio, 2012-NMSC-039, 289 P.3d 1232,rev'g, 2011-NMCA-015, 149 N.M. 394, 249 P.3d 932.\n\nPriority administration regulations do not conflict with the judiciary in inter se adjudications.— The state engineer's active water resources management regulations, 19.25.13.1-.50 (12/30/2004), which provide for the administration of water resources according to administrative interim priority determinations, do not conflict with the role of the judiciary in inter se adjudications of water priorities because nothing in the New Mexico Constitution establishes a right to an inter se adjudication of priority and the New Mexico water adjudication statutes do not preclude the administration of water rights prior to the filing of a final decree adjudicating priorities.Tri-State Gen. & Trans. Ass'n., Inc., v. D'Antonio, 2012-NMSC-039, 289 P.3d 1232,rev'g, 2011-NMCA-015, 149 N.M. 394, 249 P.3d 932.\n\nRegulation of the use of a water right is not a deprivation of that right.— A water right entitles its holder to only the use of water according to priority. A regulation of that use by the state does not amount to a deprivation of that right in violation of due process.Tri-State Gen. & Trans. Ass'n., Inc., v. D'Antonio, 2012-NMSC-039, 289 P.3d 1232.\n\nRegulations provide adequate notice of the evidence the state engineer will consider.— The state engineer's active water resources management regulations, 19.25.13.1-.50 (12/30/2004), which requires the state engineer to determine the elements of each user's administrable water right based on an express hierarchy of the types of publically available evidence the state engineer can consider, provides sufficient notice to water rights holders about the types of evidence the state engineer will consider when making water priority determinations and is not unconstitutionally vague.Tri-State Gen. & Trans. Ass'n., Inc., v. D'Antonio, 2012-NMSC-039, 289 P.3d 1232.\n\nPowers of state engineer. — Based upon the statutory language and the historical authority of the state engineer, the legislature did not intend Section 72-2-9.1 NMSA 1978 to provide the state engineer with the additional power of determining water right priorities as among water rights owners and to curtail water usage based upon such administrative determinations.

A non-consumptive beneficial use piggy-backed onto a fully appropriated basin can, under certain appropriate circumstances, be a legitimate appropriation.Carangelo v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty.

An applicant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing in every circumstance; a party only has a statutory right to a post-decision hearing if certain preconditions are met and if an adverse decision was entered without a prior hearing.Augustin Plains Ranch v. D'Antonio, 2023-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nConstitutionality.— Proviso added by 1967 amendment to this section (since rewritten), stating that section was to have no application to hearings relating to underground waters required to be held in district court, was unconstitutional as a violation of separation of powers doctrine of state constitution; nor was it validated by subsequent adoption of N.M. Const., art. XVI, § 5, relating to appeals in matters concerning water rights, since hearings contemplated by the proviso were original proceedings in district court.Fellows v. Shultz, 1970-NMSC-071, 81 N.M. 496, 469 P.2d 141.\n\nAggrieved party's right to a post-decision hearing.— The state engineer was required to grant property owner's request for a post-decision hearing because no pre-decision hearing had been held.Derringer v. Turney, 2001-NMCA-075, 131 N.M. 40, 33 P.3d 40, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 64 , 33 P.3d 284.\n\nNature of state engineer's findings.— Even though state engineer is required under legislative mandate to determine facts to which law, as set forth by legislature, is to be applied, in so doing he is nevertheless acting in an administrative capacity, and his findings are not judicial determinations.Fellows v. Shultz, 1970-NMSC-071, 81 N.M. 496, 469 P.2d 141.\n\nExhaustion of administrative remedies is required.— Where plaintiff, who claimed to own water rights, filed an application to change the point of diversion and place and purpose of use; the state engineer denied the application on the ground that plaintiff possessed no valid water rights to transfer; plaintiff requested an administrative hearing; and prior to the administrative hearing, plaintiff filed a petition in district court seeking a declaratory judgment to establish plaintiff's water rights, the district court properly dismissed the declaratory judgment action, because plaintiff was required to proceed with the administrative process to pursue relief from the state engineer's determination.Headen v. D'Antonio, 2011-NMCA-058, 149 N.M. 667, 253 P.3d 957.\n\nAppeal of decision to adopt regulations.— Section 72-2-16 NMSA 1978 addresses water adjudications in the context of a specific dispute and to create a statutory right to a hearing when certain conditions are met. It does not create a right of appeal challenging the state engineer's decision to adopt active water resource management regulations.Tri-State Generation & Transmission Ass'n, Inc. v. D'Antonio, 2011-NMCA-014, 149 N.M. 386, 249 P.3d 924, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-002, 150 N.M. 617, 264 P.3d 129.\n\nStay of administrative proceeding pending declaratory judgment action did not constitute waiver of exhaustion of administrative remedies.— Where plaintiff, who claimed to own water rights, requested an administrative hearing after the state engineer determined that plaintiff possessed no valid water rights; prior to the administrative hearing, plaintiff filed a petition in district court seeking a declaratory judgment to establish plaintiff's water rights; and the state engineer stipulated that the state engineer would take no further action in the administrative proceeding until the petition for declaratory judgment had been heard and decided by the district court, the stipulation did not constitute a waiver of exhaustion of administrative remedies.Headen v. D'Antonio, 2011-NMCA-058, 149 N.M. 667, 253 P.3d 957.\n\nState engineer's decision does not bar subsequent litigation.— While the decision of the state engineer in granting a permit has the force and effect of a judicial judgment, where the depth of an applicant's well and the diameter of the pipe and the amount of water are not in issue and not essential to a prior decision, the state engineer's determination does not bar subsequent litigation of those issues.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Rio Rancho Estates, Inc., 1981-NMSC-017, 95 N.M. 560, 624 P.2d 502.\n\nCourt erred in permitting introduction of new or additional evidenceon appeal from state engineer's decision denying application for permit to change partial point of diversion.Derrick v. Reynolds, 1964-NMSC-085, 74 N.M. 181, 392 P.2d 13.\n\nOnly courts have power and authority to adjudicate water rights.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Lewis, 1973-NMSC-035, 84 N.M. 768, 508 P.2d 577.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"New Mexico State Engineer Issues Orders on Mine Dewatering,\" see 20 Nat. Resources J. 359 (1980).\n\nAm.

When a person, pursuant to a finding of fact, violates a requirement or prohibition of Chapter 72 NMSA 1978, a regulation, code, order or special order adopted by the state engineer pursuant to Section 72-2-8 NMSA 1978, a condition of a permit or license issued by the state engineer pursuant to law or an order entered by a court adjudicating a water right, the state engineer may, in addition to any other remedies available under law, issue a compliance order stating with reasonable specificity the nature of the violation and requiring compliance within a specified time period. A compliance order shall not be effective against any party other than the person against whom the compliance order is issued.\n\nB. This section shall not be construed to affect or interfere with any jurisdiction of an irrigation district, conservancy district, a state court, a federal court or an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo to enforce its orders and decrees pertaining to water rights.\n\nC. A compliance order may include an order to cease the violation of a requirement or prohibition of Chapter 72 NMSA 1978, a directive issued in accordance with the provisions of Section 72-2-8 NMSA 1978, a condition of a permit or license issued by the state engineer or an order entered by a court adjudicating a water right.\n\nD. The state engineer shall provide an opportunity for the person named in the compliance order to have a hearing on the alleged violation pursuant to Section 72-2-16 NMSA 1978. A hearing shall be held if a written request is made to the state engineer within thirty days after receipt of the notice of the compliance order sent by certified mail. A compliance order issued pursuant to this section shall become final unless the person named in the order submits a written request for a hearing to the state engineer within thirty days of receipt of the order. A compliance order shall be enforceable only upon becoming final. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the person named in the order from pursuing an informal resolution of the matter after a timely request for hearing has been made.\n\nE. A compliance order may require repayment of water that was overdiverted or illegally diverted. Repayment of water may be up to double the amount of the overdiversion or illegal diversion. In determining the repayment of water beyond the amount overdiverted or illegally diverted, the state engineer shall take into consideration the seriousness of the violation, any good faith efforts to comply with the applicable requirements and any other relevant factors. Any requirement to repay water shall not be enforceable until the compliance order becomes final. Installation of a measuring device may be required prior to any future diversion of water.\n\nF. Any appeal to district court shall be conducted pursuant to Chapter 72, Article 7 NMSA 1978 and shall not stay enforcement of the compliance order unless ordered by the district court.\n\nG. After a compliance order becomes final, the state engineer may assess a civil penalty of up to one hundred dollars ($100) per day for violation of the compliance order. Any civil penalty assessed shall accrue from the date of assessment of the penalty.\n\nH. If a person does not comply with a compliance order, the state engineer may file a civil action to enforce the compliance order and receive any of the remedies provided in this section, including injunctive relief.\n\nHistory:Laws 2001, ch. 143, § 1; 2007, ch. 82, § 1.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, provided that compliance orders are effective only against the party against whom it is issued; that this section does not affect the jurisdiction of conservancy districts and state courts; that compliance orders may include orders to cease violations of Chapter 72 NMSA 1978, a directive issued pursuant to Section 72-2-8 NMSA 1978, a condition of a permit or license or court order; that persons named in compliance orders may request a hearing of alleged violations; that a compliance order may require repayment of overdiverted or illegally diverted water; and that appeals to the district court do not stay enforcement of the compliance order unless otherwise ordered by the district court.",
