      "text": "The state of New Mexico does hereby ratify, approve and adopt the compact aforesaid, which is as follows:\n\nCANADIAN RIVER COMPACT\n\nThe state of New Mexico, the state of Texas, and the state of Oklahoma, acting through their commissioners, John H. Bliss, for the state of New Mexico, E. V. Spence for the state of Texas, and Clarence Burch for the state of Oklahoma, after negotiations participated in by Berkeley Johnson, appointed by the president as the representative of the United States of America, have agreed respecting Canadian river as follows:\n\nThe major purposes of this compact [this section] are to promote interstate comity; to remove causes of present and future controversy; to make secure and protect present developments within the states; and to provide for the construction of additional works for the conservation of the waters of Canadian river.\n\nAs used in this compact:\n\n(a) the term \"Canadian river\" means the tributary of Arkansas river which rises in northeastern New Mexico and flows in an easterly direction through New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma and includes North Canadian river and all other tributaries of said Canadian river;\n\n(b) the term \"North Canadian river\" means that major tributary of Canadian river officially known as North Canadian river from its source to its junction with Canadian river and includes all tributaries of North Canadian river;\n\n(c) the term \"commission\" means the agency created by this compact for the administration thereof;\n\n(d) the term \"conservation storage\" means that portion of the capacity of reservoirs available for the storage of water for subsequent release for domestic, municipal, irrigation and industrial uses, or any of them, and it excludes any portion of the capacity of reservoirs allocated solely to flood control, power production and sediment control, or any of them.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nAll rights to any of the waters of Canadian river which have been perfected by beneficial use are hereby recognized and affirmed.\n\n(a) New Mexico shall have free and unrestricted use of all waters originating in the drainage basin of Canadian river above Conchas dam.\n\n(b) New Mexico shall have free and unrestricted use of all waters originating in the drainage basin of Canadian river in New Mexico below Conchas dam, provided that the amount of conservation storage in New Mexico available for impounding these waters which originate in the drainage basin of Canadian river below Conchas dam shall be limited to an aggregate of 200,000 acre-feet.\n\n(c) The right of New Mexico to provide conservation storage in the drainage basin of North Canadian river shall be limited to the storage of such water as at the time may be unappropriated under the laws of New Mexico and of Oklahoma.\n\nTexas shall have free and unrestricted use of all waters of Canadian river in Texas, subject to the limitations upon storage of water set forth below:\n\n(a) the right of Texas to impound any of the waters of North Canadian river shall be limited to storage on tributaries of said river in Texas for municipal uses, for household and domestic uses, livestock watering, and the irrigation of lands which are cultivated solely for the purpose of providing food and feed for the householders and domestic livestock actually living or kept on the property;\n\n(b) until more than 300,000 acre-feet of conservation storage shall be provided in Oklahoma, exclusive of reservoirs in the drainage basin of North Canadian river and exclusive of reservoirs in the drainage basin of Canadian river east of the 97th meridian, the right of Texas to retain water in conservation storage, exclusive of waters of North Canadian river, shall be limited to 500,000 acre-feet; thereafter the right of Texas to impound and retain such waters in storage shall be limited to an aggregate quantity equal to 200,000 acre-feet plus whatever amount of water shall be at the same time in conservation storage in reservoirs in the drainage basin of Canadian river in Oklahoma, exclusive of reservoirs in the drainage basin of North Canadian river and exclusive of reservoirs east of the 97th meridian; and for the purpose of determining the amount of water in conservation storage, the maximum quantity of water in storage following each flood or series of floods shall be used; provided, that the right of Texas to retain and use any quantity of water previously impounded shall not be reduced by any subsequent application of the provisions of this Paragraph (b);\n\n(c) should Texas for any reason impound any amount of water greater than the aggregate quantity specified in Paragraph (b) of this article, such excess shall be retained in storage until under the provisions of said paragraph Texas shall become entitled to its use; provided, that, in event of spill from conservation storage, any such excess shall be reduced by the amount of such spill from the most easterly reservoir on Canadian river in Texas; provided further, that all such excess quantities in storage shall be reduced monthly to compensate for reservoir losses in proportion to the total amount of water in the reservoir or reservoirs in which such excess water is being held; and provided further that on demand by the commissioner for Oklahoma the remainder of any such excess quantity of water in storage shall be released into the channel of Canadian river at the greatest rate practicable.\n\nOklahoma shall have free and unrestricted use of all waters of Canadian river in Oklahoma.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nThe commission may permit New Mexico to impound more water than the amount set forth in Article IV and may permit Texas to impound more water than the amount set forth in Article V; provided, that no state shall thereby be deprived of water needed for beneficial use; provided further that each such permission shall be for a limited period not exceeding twelve months; and provided further that no state or user of water within any state shall thereby acquire any right to the continued use of any such quantity of water so permitted to be impounded.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nEach state shall furnish to the commission at intervals designated by the commission accurate records of the quantities of water stored in reservoirs pertinent to the administration of this compact [this section].\n\n(a) There is hereby created an interstate administrative agency to be known as the \"Canadian river commission.\" The commission shall be composed of three commissioners, one from each of the signatory states, designated or appointed in accordance with the laws of each such state, and if designated by the president an additional commissioner representing the United States. The president is hereby requested to designate such a commissioner. If so designated, the commissioner representing the United States shall be the presiding officer of the commission, but shall not have the right to vote in any of the deliberations of the commission. All members of the commission must be present to constitute a quorum. A unanimous vote of the commissioners for the three signatory states shall be necessary to all actions taken by the commission.\n\n(b) The salaries and personal expenses of each commissioner shall be paid by the government which he represents. All other expenses which are incurred by the commission incident to the administration of this compact and which are not paid by the United States shall be borne equally by the three states and be paid by the commission out of a revolving fund hereby created to be known as the \"Canadian river revolving fund.\" Such fund shall be initiated and maintained by equal payments of each state into the fund in such amounts as will be necessary for administration of this compact. Disbursements shall be made from said fund in such manner as may be authorized by the commission. Said fund shall not be subject to the audit and accounting procedures of the states. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the commission shall be audited by a qualified independent public accountant at regular intervals and the report of the audit shall be included in and become a part of the annual report of the commission.\n\n(c) The commission may:\n\n(1) employ such engineering, legal, clerical and other personnel as in its judgment may be necessary for the performance of its functions under this compact;\n\n(2) enter into contracts with appropriate federal agencies for the collection, correlation and presentation of factual data, for the maintenance of records, and for the preparation of reports;\n\n(3) perform all functions required of it by this compact and do all things necessary, proper or convenient in the performance of its duties hereunder, independently or in cooperation with appropriate governmental agencies.\n\n(d) The commission shall:\n\n(1) cause to be established, maintained and operated such stream and other gaging stations and evaporation stations as may from time to time be necessary for proper administration of the compact, independently or in cooperation with appropriate governmental agencies;\n\n(2) make and transmit to the governors of the signatory states on or before the last day of March of each year, a report covering the activities of the commission for the preceding year;\n\n(3) make available to the governor of any signatory state, on his request, any information within its possession at any time, and shall always provide access to its records by the governors of the states, or their representatives, or by authorized representatives of the United States.\n\nNothing in this compact shall be construed as:\n\n(a) affecting the obligations of the United States to the Indian tribes;\n\n(b) subjecting any property of the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, to taxation by any state or subdivision thereof, or creating any obligation on the part of the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, by reason of the acquisition, construction or operation of any property or works of whatever kind, to make any payment to any state or political subdivision thereof, state agency, municipality or entity whatsoever, in reimbursement for the loss of taxes;\n\n(c) subjecting any property of the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, to the laws of any state to an extent other than the extent to which such laws would apply without regard to this compact;\n\n(d) applying to, or interfering with, the right or power of any signatory state to regulate within its boundaries the appropriation, use and control of water, not inconsistent with its obligations under this compact;\n\n(e) establishing any general principle or precedent applicable to other interstate streams.\n\nThis compact shall become binding and obligatory when it shall have been ratified by the legislature of each state and approved by the congress of the United States. Notice of ratification by the legislature of each state shall be given by the governor of that state to the governors of the other states and to the president of the United States. The president is hereby requested to give notice to the governor of each state of approval by the congress of the United States.\n\nIn witness whereof, the commissioners have executed four counterparts hereof, each of which shall be and constitute an original, one of which shall be deposited in the archives of the department of state of the United States, and one of which shall be forwarded to the governor of each state.\n\nDone at the city of Santa Fe, state of New Mexico, this 6th day of December, 1950.\n\n/s/ JOHN H. BLISSJohn H. BlissCommissioner for the state ofNew Mexico/s/ E. V. SPENCEE. V. SpenceCommissioner for the state ofTexas/s/ CLARENCE BURCHClarence BurchCommissioner for the state ofOklahomaAPPROVED:/s/ BERKELEY JOHNSON\n\nBerkeley Johnson\n\nRepresentative of the United\n\nStates of America\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 72-15-2, enacted by Laws 1951, ch. 4, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The first Canadian River Compact, which included the state of Arkansas, was ratified by Laws 1927, ch. 40, but was subsequently repealed by Laws 1937, ch. 32.\n\nArticle IV(b) limitation on stored water.— The Article IV(b) limitation on \"conservation storage\" applies to stored water, not physical reservoir capacity.Okla. v. N.M., 501 U.S. 221, 111 S. Ct. 2281, 115 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1991).\n\nWaters originating in the Canadian river basin above Conchas dam, but reaching the mainstream of the Canadian river below Conchas dam as a result of spills or releases from Conchas dam or seepage and return flow from the Tucumcari Project, are subject to the Article IV(b) limitation on stored water.Okla. v. N.M., 501 U.S. 221, 111 S. Ct. 2281, 115 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1991).\n\nIt does not necessarily follow that New Mexico's entitlement under Article IV(a) to all of the Canadian river water it can use from Conchas reservoir gives New Mexico the unrestricted right to store that water at any point downstream from Conchas dam. Any right New Mexico has to water spilling over Conchas dam arises by virtue of Article IV(b) under which New Mexico may store for its use 200,000 acre-feet of water originating belowConchas dam. Okla. v. N.M., 501 U.S. 221, 111 S. Ct. 2281, 115 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1991).\n\nThe question whether certain water stored in Ute Reservoir, water which New Mexico has designated a \"desilting pool\", is exempt from Article IV(b) limitation on New Mexico's conservation storage, because it allegedly serves a \"sediment control\" purpose within the meaning of Article II(d), was remanded to a special master for further proceedings and a recommendation on the merits. Okla. v. N.M., 501 U.S. 221, 111 S. Ct. 2281, 115 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1991).\n\nAdequacy of water storage rights.— The central purpose of the compact was to settle the respective rights of the states to Canadian river water, and the compact and its negotiating history plainly show that the parties agreed that no more than 200,000 acre-feet of storage rights would satisfy all of New Mexico's future needs for water below Conchas dam.

C.\n\nCOLORADO RIVER COMPACT\n\nThe states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, having resolved to enter into a compact under the act of the congress of the United States of America, approved August 19, 1921 (42 Statutes at Large, page 171) and the acts of legislatures of the said states, have, through their governors, appointed as their commissioners:\n\nW. S. Norveil for the state of Arizona,\n\nW. F. McClure for the state of California,\n\nDelph E. Carpenter for the state of Colorado,\n\nJ. G. Scrugham for the state of Nevada,\n\nStephen B. Davis, Jr., for the state of New Mexico,\n\nR. E. Caldwell for the state of Utah,\n\nFrank C. Emerson for the state of Wyoming,\n\nwho, after negotiations participated in by Herbert Hoover, appointed by the president as the representative of the United States of America, have agreed upon the following articles:\n\nThe major purposes of this compact [this section] are to provide for the equitable division and apportionment of the use of the waters of the Colorado river system; to establish the relative importance of different beneficial uses of water; to promote interstate comity; to remove causes of present and future controversies; and to secure the expeditious agricultural and industrial development of the Colorado river basin, the storage of its waters and the protection of life and property from floods. To these ends the Colorado river basin is divided into two basins, and an apportionment of the use of part of the water of the Colorado river system is made to each of them with the provision that further equitable apportionments may be made.\n\nAs used in this compact:\n\n(a) the term \"Colorado river system\" means that portion of the Colorado river and its tributaries within the United States of America;\n\n(b) the term \"Colorado river basin\" means all of the drainage area of the Colorado river system, and all other territory within the United States of America to which the waters of the Colorado river system shall be beneficially applied;\n\n(c) the term \"states of the upper division\" means the states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming;\n\n(d) the term \"states of the lower division\" means the states of Arizona, California and Nevada;\n\n(e) the term \"Lee Ferry\" means a point in the main stream of Colorado river one mile below the mouth of the Paria river;\n\n(f) the term \"upper basin\" means those parts of the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming within and from which waters naturally drain into the Colorado river system above Lee Ferry, and also all parts of said states located without the drainage area of the Colorado river system which are now or shall hereafter be beneficially served by waters diverted from the system above Lee Ferry;\n\n(g) the term \"lower basin\" means those parts of the states of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah within and from which waters naturally drain into the Colorado river system below Lee Ferry, and also all parts of said states located without the drainage area of the Colorado river system which are now or shall hereafter be beneficially served by waters diverted from the system below Lee Ferry;\n\n(h) the term \"domestic use\" shall include the use of water for household, stock, municipal, mining, milling, industrial and other like purposes, but shall exclude the generation of electrical power.\n\nARTICLE III\n\n(a) There is hereby apportioned from the Colorado river system in perpetuity to the upper basin and to the lower basin, respectively, the exclusive beneficial consumptive use of 7,500,000 acre-feet of water per annum, which shall include all water necessary for the supply of any rights which may now exist.\n\n(b) In addition to the apportionment in Paragraph (a), the lower basin is hereby given the right to increase its beneficial consumptive use of such waters by one million acre-feet per annum.\n\n(c) If, as a matter of international comity, the United States of America shall hereafter recognize in the United States of Mexico any right to the use of any waters of the Colorado river system, such waters shall be supplied first from the waters which are surplus over and above the aggregate of the quantities specified in Paragraphs (a) and (b); and if such surplus shall prove insufficient for this purpose, then, the burden of such deficiency shall be equally borne by the upper basin and the lower basin, and whenever necessary the states of the upper division shall deliver at Lee Ferry water to supply one-half of the deficiency so recognized in addition to that provided in Paragraph (d).\n\n(d) The states of the upper division will not cause the flow of the river at Lee Ferry to be depleted below an aggregate of 75,000,000 acre-feet for any period of ten consecutive years reckoned in continuing progressive series, beginning with the first day of October next succeeding the ratification of this compact.\n\n(e) The states of the upper division shall not withhold water, and the states of the lower division shall not require the delivery of water, which cannot reasonably be applied to domestic and agricultural uses.\n\n(f) Further equitable apportionment of the beneficial uses of the waters of the Colorado river system unapportioned by Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) may be made in the manner provided in Paragraph (g) at any time after October first, 1963, if and when either basin shall have reached its total beneficial consumptive use as set out in Paragraphs (a) and (b).\n\n(g) In any event of a desire for a further apportionment as provided in Paragraph (f) any two signatory states, acting through their governors, may give joint notice of such desire to the governors of the other signatory states and to the president of the United States of America, and it shall be the duty of the governors of the signatory states and of the president of the United States of America forthwith to appoint representatives, whose duty it shall be to divide and apportion equitably between the upper basin and lower basin the beneficial use of the unapportioned water of the Colorado river system as mentioned in Paragraph (f), subject to the legislative ratification of the signatory states and the congress of the United States of America.\n\n(a) Inasmuch as the Colorado river has ceased to be navigable for commerce and the reservation of its waters for navigation would seriously limit the development of its basin, the use of its waters for purposes of navigation shall be subservient to the uses of such waters for domestic, agricultural and power purposes. If the congress shall not consent to this paragraph, the other provisions of this compact shall nevertheless remain binding.\n\n(b) Subject to the provisions of this compact, water of the Colorado river system may be impounded and used for the generation of electrical power, but such impounding and use shall be subservient to the use and consumption of such water for agricultural and domestic purposes and shall not interfere with or prevent use for such dominant purposes.\n\n(c) The provisions of this article shall not apply to or interfere with the regulation and control by any state within its boundaries of the appropriation, use and distribution of water.\n\nThe chief official of each signatory state charged with the administration of water rights, together with the director of the United States reclamation service and the director of the United States geological survey shall cooperate, ex officio:\n\n(a) to promote the systematic determination and coordination of the facts as to flow, appropriation, consumption and use of water in the Colorado river basin, and the interchange of available information in such matters;\n\n(b) to secure the ascertainment and publication of the annual flow of the Colorado river at Lee Ferry;\n\n(c) to perform such other duties as may be assigned by mutual consent of the signatories from time to time.\n\nShould any claim or controversy arise between any two or more of the signatory states:\n\n(a) with respect to the waters of the Colorado river system not covered by the terms of this compact [this section];\n\n(b) over the meaning or performance of any of the terms of this compact;\n\n(c) as to the allocation of the burdens incident to the performance of any article of this compact or the delivery of waters as herein provided;\n\n(d) as to the construction or operation of works within the Colorado river basin to be situated in two or more states, or to be constructed in one state for the benefit of another state; or\n\n(e) as to the diversion of water in one state for the benefit of another state;\n\nthe governors of the states affected, upon the request of one of them, shall forthwith appoint commissioners with power to consider and adjust such claim or controversy, subject to ratification by the legislatures of the states so affected.\n\nNothing herein contained shall prevent the adjustment of any such claim or controversy by any present method or by direct future legislative action of the interested states.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nNothing in this compact shall be construed as affecting the obligations of the United States of America to Indian tribes.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nPresent perfected rights to the beneficial use of waters of the Colorado river system are unimpaired by this compact. Whenever storage capacity of 5,000,000 acre-feet shall have been provided on the main Colorado river within or for the benefit of the lower basin, then claims of such rights, if any, by appropriators or users of water in the lower basin against appropriators or users of water in the upper basin shall attach to and be satisfied from water that may be stored not in conflict with Article III.\n\nAll other rights to beneficial use of waters of the Colorado river system shall be satisfied solely from the water apportioned to that basin in which they are situate.\n\nNothing in this compact shall be construed to limit or prevent any state from instituting or maintaining any action or proceeding, legal or equitable, for the protection of any right under this compact or the enforcement of any of its provisions.\n\nThis compact may be terminated at any time by the unanimous agreement of the signatory states. In the event of such termination all rights established under it shall continue unimpaired.\n\nThis compact shall become binding and obligatory when it shall have been approved by the legislatures of each of the signatory states and by the congress of the United States. Notice of approval by the legislatures shall be given by the governor of each signatory state to the governors of the other signatory states and to the president of the United States, and the president of the United States is requested to give notice to the governors of the signatory states of approval by the congress of the United States.\n\nIn witness whereof, the commissioners have signed this compact in a single original, which shall be deposited in the archives of the department of state of the United States of America and of which a duly certified copy shall be forwarded to the governor of each of the signatory states.\n\nDone at the city of Santa Fe, New Mexico, this twenty-fourth day of November, A. D. one thousand nine hundred and twenty-two.\n\nW. S. NORVEIL.W. F. McCLURE.DELPH E. CARPENTER.J. G. SCRUGHAM.STEPHEN B. DAVIS, JR.R. E. CALDWELL.FRANK C. EMERSON.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 72-15-5, enacted by Laws 1923, ch. 6, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 1921, ch. 221, §§ 1 to 8, provided for the appointment of a New Mexico representative on the joint commission for negotiation of a compact and agreement on the distribution of waters of the Colorado river between the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. The executed Colorado River Compact, dated November 24, 1922, was ratified by New Mexico in Laws 1923, ch. 6, §§ 1 to 4; the text of the compact is set forth in § 1. The state of Arizona failed to ratify the compact and provisions as to ratification and approval contained in the original compact were required to be waived by the other signatory states.SeeLaws 1925, ch. 78, §§ 1 to 3. The Colorado River Compact was finally proclaimed effective by the president of the United States, June 25, 1929.\n\nArizona ratified in 1944.\n\nCross references.— For Colorado River Compact modified,see72-15-8, 72-15-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nRelation between Boulder Canyon Project and compact.— Boulder Canyon Project Act, 43 U.S.C. 617, by referring to the Colorado River Compact in several places, does make the compact relevant to a limited extent. The act explicitly approves the compact and thereby fixes a division of the waters between the basins which must be respected. The act also refers to terms contained in the compact. For example, § 12 of the act adopts the compact definition of \"domestic,\" and § 6 requires satisfaction of \"present perfected rights\" as used in the compact. Therefore, those particular terms, though originally formulated only for the compact's allocation of water between basins, are incorporated into the act and are made applicable to the project act's allocation among lower basin states.Ariz. v.

Ed. 2d 122 (1963).\n\nAuthority conferred in the Boulder Canyon Project Act is stated to be \"subject to the Colorado River Compact,\" and that instrument makes improvement of navigation subservient to all other purposes. But specific statement of primary purpose in the act governs the general references to the compact.Ariz. v. Cal., 283 U.S. 423, 51 S. Ct. 522, 75 L. Ed. 1154 (1931).\n\nBoulder Canyon Project Act also declares that secretary of interior and United States in construction, operation and maintenance of dam and other works and in the making of contracts shall be subject to and controlled by the compact. Such references, unlike explicit adoption of terms, were used only to show that the act and its provisions were in no way to upset, alter or affect compact's congressionally approved division of water between basins. They were not intended to make the compact and its provisions control or affect the act's allocation among and distribution of water within the states of the lower basin.Ariz. v. Cal., 373 U.S. 546, 83 S. Ct. 1468, 10 L. Ed. 2d 542,reh'g denied, 375 U.S. 892, 84 S. Ct. 144, 11 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1963).\n\nBy the Boulder Canyon Project Act, secretary of interior was authorized, subject to terms of the compact, to construct, operate and maintain a dam and incidental works at the present site of Boulder dam, with appurtenant hydro-electric plant, and to use and dispose of water stored above the dam for irrigation and for development of power.Ariz. v. Cal., 298 U.S. 558, 56 S. Ct. 848, 80 L. Ed. 1331 (1936).\n\nSecretary of interior and his permittees, licensees and contractees are subject to the compact, § 8(a), and therefore can do nothing to upset or encroach upon the compact's allocation of Colorado river water between the upper and lower basins. Ariz. v. Cal., 373 U.S. 546, 83 S. Ct. 1468, 10 L. Ed. 2d 542,reh'g denied, 375 U.S. 892, 84 S. Ct. 144, 11 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1963).\n\nArizona does not show that Article III(b) of the compact is relevant to an interpretation of § 4(a) of the Boulder Canyon Project Act, upon which she bases her claim of right. The act does not purport to apportion among states of the lower basin the waters to which the lower basin is entitled under the compact. The act merely places limits on California's use of waters under Article III(a) and of surplus waters; and it is \"such\" uses which are \"subject to the terms of said compact.\" Ariz. v. Cal., 292 U.S. 341, 54 S. Ct. 735, 78 L. Ed. 1298 (1934).\n\nThere can be no claim that Article III(b) of the compact is relevant in defining surplus waters under § 4(a) of the Boulder Canyon Project Act, for both Arizona and California apparently consider the waters under Article III(b) as apportioned.Ariz. v. Cal., 292 U.S. 341, 54 S. Ct. 735, 78 L. Ed. 1298 (1934).\n\nCompact immaterial to contemplated litigation.— The meaning of the compact, considered merely as a contract, can never be material in contemplated litigation, since Arizona refused to ratify the compact. Arizona rests her rights wholly upon the acts of congress and of California. Although Arizona claims that California's construction of § 4(a) of the Boulder Canyon Project Act, 45 Stat. 1057, would allow the latter state water which under the compact has been assigned to Arizona, and that a conflict is thus raised between statute and compact which the suggested testimony is competent to resolve, resolution of this alleged conflict can never be material to any case based on the compact considered as contract, since Arizona neither has nor claims any contractual right.Ariz. v. Cal., 292 U.S. 341, 54 S. Ct. 735, 78 L. Ed. 1298 (1934).\n\nApportionment of river between upper and lower basins.— By the compact entered into by defendant states and approved by congress, but to which Arizona is not a party, undepleted flow of water of Colorado river is apportioned between the upper basin and the lower basin of the river valley, the point of division being Lee ferry, 23 miles below the southern boundary of Utah. To each basin there is apportioned 7,500,000 acre feet per annum and lower basin has additional right to increase its \"beneficial consumptive use\" of water by 1,000,000 feet per annum.Ariz. v. Cal., 298 U.S. 558, 56 S. Ct. 848, 80 L. Ed. 1331 (1936).\n\nParagraph (a) of Article III of the compact apportions waters \"from the Colorado river system,\" i.e., the Colorado and its tributaries, and (b) permits additional use \"of such waters.\" The compact makes an apportionment only between the upper and lower basin, apportionment among states in each basin being left to later agreement.Ariz. v. Cal., 292 U.S. 341, 54 S. Ct. 735, 78 L. Ed. 1298 (1934).\n\nProvision of Article III(b) of the compact, like that of Article III(a) thereof, is entirely referable to the main intent of the compact, which was to apportion the waters as between the upper and lower basins. The effect of Article III(b) (at least in the event that the lower basin puts the 8,500,000 acre-feet of water to beneficial uses) is to preclude any claim by the upper basin that any part of the 7,500,000 acre-feet released at Lee ferry to the lower basin may be considered as \"surplus\" because of Arizona waters which are available to the lower basin alone. Ariz. v. Cal., 292 U.S. 341, 54 S. Ct. 735, 78 L. Ed. 1298 (1934).\n\nApportionment among states in lower basin.— Fact that waters are solely useful to Arizona, or fact that they have been appropriated by her, does not contradict intent clearly expressed in Paragraph (b) of Article III of the compact (nor the rational character thereof) to apportion 1,000,000 acre-feet to states of the lower basin and not specifically to Arizona alone.Ariz. v. Cal., 292 U.S. 341, 54 S. Ct. 735, 78 L. Ed. 1298 (1934).\n\nCongress apparently expected that a complete apportionment of the waters among states of the lower basin would be made by the sub-compact it authorized Arizona, California and Nevada to make. Ariz. v. Cal., 292 U.S. 341, 54 S. Ct. 735, 78 L. Ed. 1298 (1934).\n\nApportionment of the lower basin waters of the Colorado river is not controlled by either doctrine of equitable apportionment or by the compact.Ariz. v. Cal., 373 U.S. 546, 83 S. Ct. 1468, 10 L. Ed. 2d 542,reh'g denied, 375 U.S. 892, 84 S. Ct. 144, 11 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1963).\n\nCongress has provided its own method for allocating among lower basin states the mainstream water to which they are entitled under the compact. Where congress has so exercised its constitutional power over waters, courts have no power to substitute their own notions of \"equitable apportionment\" for apportionment chosen by congress.Ariz. v. Cal., 373 U.S. 546, 83 S. Ct. 1468, 10 L. Ed. 2d 542,reh'g denied, 375 U.S. 892, 84 S. Ct. 144, 11 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1963).\n\nNothing in the compact purports to divide water among lower basin states nor in any way to affect or control any future apportionment among those states or any distribution of water within a state.Ariz. v. Cal., 373 U.S. 546, 83 S. Ct. 1468, 10 L. Ed. 2d 542,reh'g denied, 375 U.S. 892, 84 S. Ct. 144, 11 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1963).\n\nIn Boulder Canyon Project Act, congress provides for apportionment among lower basin states of water allocated to that basin by the compact.Ariz. v. Cal., 373 U.S. 546, 83 S. Ct. 1468, 10 L. Ed. 2d 542,reh'g denied, 375 U.S. 892, 84 S. Ct. 144, 11 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1963).\n\nArizona's ownership rights of portion of river.— On stretch of Colorado between Arizona and California, Arizona owns part of river bed that is east of the thread of the stream. Her jurisdiction in respect of apportionment, use and distribution of equitable share of waters flowing therein is unaffected by the compact or federal reclamation law. But title of the state is held subject to power granted to congress by the commerce clause, and under that clause congress has power to cause to be built a dam across the river in aid of navigation.U.S. v. Ariz., 295 U.S. 174, 55 S. Ct. 666, 79 L. Ed. 1371 (1935).\n\nSettlement of Indian water rights did not require Indian tribes to prove immediate beneficial use to quantify their water rights.— Where the Navajo Nation, the United States, and the state of New Mexico reached an agreement settling the Navajo Nation's claims to water in the San Juan river basin, and where federal legislation to approve and implement the settlement agreement was enacted by congress, and where the New Mexico legislature appropriated funds to pay New Mexico's cost of the settlement agreement and authorized the New Mexico state engineer to seek judicial approval regarding the state's share of the water, and where the district court approved the settlement agreement, concluding that the settlement agreement was fair, adequate, reasonable, and consistent with the public interests as well as all applicable laws, appellants' claim that the Navajo Nation was required to prove immediate beneficial use to quantify their water rights and that beneficial use is an essential requirement of every federal law governing the allocation of water was without merit, because Indian water rights are proprietary rights that have a priority date, the date of the creation of the reservation, but they are not dependent on the application of water to beneficial use.State ex rel.

Stone, for Colorado\n\nThomas M. McClure, for New Mexico\n\nwho, after negotiations, have agreed upon these articles:\n\nThe major purposes of this compact [this section] are to provide for the equitable division and apportionment of the use of the waters of Costilla creek; to promote interstate comity; to remove causes of present and future interstate controversies; to assure the most efficient utilization of the waters of Costilla creek; to provide for the integrated operation of existing and prospective irrigation facilities on the stream in the two states; to adjust the conflicting jurisdictions of the two states over irrigation works and facilities diverting and storing water in one state for use in both states; to equalize the benefits of water from Costilla creek, used for the irrigation of contiguous lands lying on either side of the boundary, between the citizens and water users of one state and those of the other; and to place the beneficial application of water diverted from Costilla creek for irrigation by the water users of the two states on a common basis.\n\nThe physical and other conditions peculiar to the Costilla creek and its basin, and the nature and location of the irrigation development and the facilities in connection therewith, constitute the basis for this compact; and neither of the states hereby, nor the congress of the United States by its consent, concedes that this compact establishes any general principle or precedent with respect to any other interstate stream.\n\nAs used in this compact, the following names, terms and expressions are described, defined, applied and taken to mean as in this article set forth:\n\n(a) \"Costilla creek\" is a tributary of the Rio Grande which rises on the west slope of the Sangre de Cristo range in the extreme southeastern corner of Costilla county in Colorado and flows in a general westerly direction crossing the boundary three times above its confluence with the Rio Grande in New Mexico;\n\n(b) the \"canyon mouth\" is that point on Costilla creek in New Mexico where the stream leaves the mountains and emerges into the San Luis valley;\n\n(c) the \"Amalia area\" is that irrigated area in New Mexico above the canyon mouth and below the Costilla reservoir which is served by decreed direct flow water rights;\n\n(d) the \"Costilla-Garcia area\" is that area extending from the canyon mouth in New Mexico to a point in Colorado about four miles downstream from the boundary, being a compact body of irrigated land on either side of Costilla creek served by decreed direct flow water rights;\n\n(e) the \"Eastdale reservoir no. 1\" is that off-channel reservoir located in Colorado in sections 7, 8 and 18, township 1 north, range 73 west, and sections 12 and 13, township 1 north, range 74 west of the Costilla Estates survey, with a nominal capacity of three thousand four hundred sixty-eight (3,468) acre-feet and a present usable capacity of two thousand (2,000) acre-feet;\n\n(f) the \"Eastdale reservoir no. 2\" is that off-channel reservoir located in Colorado in sections 3, 4, 9 and 10, township 1 north, range 73 west, of the Costilla Estates survey, with a nominal capacity of three thousand forty-one (3,041) acre-feet;\n\n(g) the \"Costilla reservoir\" is that channel reservoir, having a nominal capacity of fifteen thousand seven hundred (15,700) acre-feet, located in New Mexico near the headwaters of Costilla creek. The present usable capacity of the reservoir is eleven thousand (11,000) acre-feet, subject to future adjustment by the state engineer of New Mexico. The condition of Costilla dam may be such that the state engineer of New Mexico will not permit storage above a determined stage except for short periods of time;\n\n(h) the \"Cerro canal\" is that irrigation canal which diverts water from the left bank of Costilla creek in New Mexico near the southwest corner of section 12, township 1 south, range 73 west, of the Costilla Estates survey, and runs in a northwesterly direction to the boundary near boundary monument no. 140;\n\n(i) the \"boundary\" is the term used herein to describe the common boundary line between Colorado and New Mexico;\n\n(j) the term \"Costilla reservoir system\" means and includes the Costilla reservoir and the Cerro canal, the permits for the storage of water in Costilla reservoir, the twenty-four and fifty-two hundredths (24.52) cubic feet per second of time of direct flow water rights transferred to the Cerro canal, and the permits for the diversion of direct flow water by the Cerro canal as adjusted herein to seventy-five and forty-eight hundredths (75.48) cubic feet per second of time;\n\n(k) the term \"Costilla reservoir system safe yield\" means that quantity of usable water made available each year by the Costilla reservoir system. The safe yield represents the most beneficial operation of the Costilla reservoir system through the use, first, of the total usable portion of the yield of the twenty-four and fifty-two hundredths (24.52) cubic feet per second of time of direct flow rights transferred to the Cerro canal, second, of the total usable portion of the yield of the direct flow Cerro canal permits, and third, of that portion of the water stored in Costilla reservoir required to complete such safe yield;\n\n(l) the term \"usable capacity\" is defined and means that capacity of Costilla reservoir at the stage above which the state engineer of New Mexico will not permit storage except for short periods of time;\n\n(m) the term \"temporary storage\" is defined and means the water permitted by the state engineer of New Mexico to be stored in Costilla reservoir for short periods of time above the usable capacity of that reservoir;\n\n(n) the term \"additional storage facilities\" is defined and means storage capacity which may be provided in either state to impound waters of Costilla creek and its tributaries in addition to the nominal capacity of Costilla reservoir and the Costilla creek complement of the Eastdale reservoir no. 1 capacity;\n\n(o) the term \"duty of water\" is defined as the rate in cubic feet per second of time at which water may be diverted at the headgate to irrigate a specified acreage of land during the period of maximum requirement;\n\n(p) the term \"surplus water\" is defined and means water which cannot be stored in operating reservoirs during the storage season or water during the irrigation season which cannot be stored in operating reservoirs and which is in excess of the aggregate direct flow rights and permits recognized by this compact;\n\n(q) the term \"irrigation season\" is defined and means that period of each calendar year from May 16 to September 30, inclusive;\n\n(r) the term \"storage season\" is defined and means that period of time extending from October 1 of one year to May 15 of the succeeding year, inclusive;\n\n(s) the term \"points of interstate delivery\" means and includes:\n\n(1) the Acequia Madre where it crosses the boundary;\n\n(2) the Costilla creek where it crosses the boundary;\n\n(3) the Cerro canal where it reaches the boundary; and\n\n(4) any other interstate canals which might be constructed with the approval of the commission at the point or points where they cross the boundary;\n\n(t) the term \"water company\" means the San Luis Power and Water Company, a Colorado corporation, or its successor;\n\n(u) the word \"commission\" means the Costilla Creek Compact commission created by Article VIII of this compact for the administration thereof.\n\nARTICLE III\n\n1. To accomplish the purposes of this compact, as set forth in Article I, the following adjustments in the operation of irrigation facilities on Costilla creek, and in the use of water diverted, stored and regulated thereby, are made:\n\n(a) the quantity of water delivered for use in the two states by direct flow ditches in the Costilla-Garcia area and by the Cerro canal is based on a duty of water of one cubic foot per second of time for each eighty (80) acres, to be applied in the order of priority; provided, however, that this adjustment in each instance is based on the acreage as determined by the court in decreeing the water rights for the Costilla-Garcia area, and in the case of the Cerro canal such basis shall apply to eight thousand (8,000) acres of land; and provided further that, in order to maintain a usable head, any ditch supplying water for the Costilla-Garcia area in Colorado shall be permitted to divert for beneficial consumptive use not less than one cubic foot per second of time under its water right;\n\n(b) there is transferred from certain ditches in the Costilla-Garcia area twenty-four and fifty-two hundredths (24.52) cubic feet per second of time of direct flow water rights, which rights of use are held by the water company or its successors in title, to the headgate of the Cerro canal. The twenty-four and fifty-two hundredths (24.52) cubic feet of water per second of time hereby transferred represents an evaluation of these rights after adjustment in the duty of water, pursuant to Subsection (a) of this article, and includes a reduction thereof to compensate for increased use of direct flow water which otherwise would have been possible under these rights by this transfer;\n\n(c) except for the rights to store water from Costilla creek in Eastdale reservoir no. 1 as hereinafter provided, all diversion and storage rights from Costilla creek for Eastdale reservoirs no. 1 and no. 2 are relinquished and the water decreed thereunder is returned to the creek for use in accordance with the plan of integrated operation effectuated by this compact;\n\n(d) the Cerro canal direct flow permit shall be seventy-five and forty-eight hundredths (75.48) cubic feet per second of time;\n\n(e) there is transferred to and made available for the irrigation of lands in Colorado a portion of the Costilla reservoir complement of the Costilla reservoir system safe yield in order that the storage of water in that reservoir may be made for the benefit of water users in both Colorado and New Mexico under the provisions of this compact for the allocations of water and the operation of facilities.\n\n2. Each state grants for the benefit of the other and its water users the rights to change the points of diversion of water from Costilla creek, to divert water from the stream in one state for use in the other and to store water in one state for the irrigation of lands in the other, insofar as the exercise of such rights may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this article and to comply with the terms of this compact.\n\n3. The water company has consented to and approved the adjustments contained in this article; and such consent and approval shall be evidenced in writing and filed with the commission.\n\nThe apportionment and allocation of the use of Costilla creek water shall be as follows:\n\n(a) there is allocated for diversion from the natural flow of Costilla creek and its tributaries sufficient water for beneficial use on meadow and pasture lands above Costilla reservoir in New Mexico to the extent and in the manner now prevailing in that area;\n\n(b) there is allocated for diversion from the natural flow of Costilla creek and its tributaries thirteen and forty-two hundredths (13.42) cubic feet of water per second of time for beneficial use on lands in the Amalia area in New Mexico;\n\n(c) in addition to allocations made in Subsections (c) [e], (f) and (g) of this article, there is allocated for diversion from the natural flow of Costilla creek fifty-one and forty-two hundredths (51.42) cubic feet of water per second of time for Colorado and eighty-eight and twenty-eight hundredths (88.28) cubic feet of water per second of time for New Mexico, subject to adjustment as provided in Article V (e), and such water shall be delivered for beneficial use in the two states in accordance with the schedules and under the conditions set forth in Article V;\n\n(d) there is allocated for diversion from the natural flow of Costilla creek sufficient water to provide each year one thousand (1,000) acre-feet of stored water in Eastdale reservoir no. 1, such water to be delivered as provided in Article V;\n\n(e) there is allocated for diversion to Colorado thirty-six and five-tenths percent (36.5%) and to New Mexico sixty-three and five-tenths percent (63.5%) of the water stored by Costilla reservoir for release therefrom for irrigation purposes each year, subject to adjustment as provided in Article V (e) and such water shall be delivered for beneficial use in the two states on a parity basis in accordance with the provisions of Article V. By \"parity basis\" is meant that neither state shall enjoy a priority of right of use;\n\n(f) there is allocated for beneficial use in each of the states of Colorado and New Mexico one-half of the surplus water, as defined in Article II (p), to be delivered as provided in Article V;\n\n(g) there is allocated for beneficial use in each of the states of Colorado and New Mexico one-half of any water made available and usable by additional storage facilities which may be constructed in the future.\n\nThe operation of the facilities of Costilla creek and the delivery of water for the irrigation of land in Colorado and New Mexico, in accordance with the allocations made in Article IV, shall be as follows:\n\n(a) diversions of water for use on lands in the Amalia area shall be made as set forth in Article IV (b) in the order of decreed priorities in New Mexico and of relative priority dates in the two states, subject to the right of New Mexico to change the points of diversion and places of use of any of such water to other points of diversion and places of use; provided, however, that the rights so transferred shall be limited in each instance to the quantity of water actually consumed on the lands from which the right is transferred;\n\n(b) deliveries to Colorado of direct flow water below the canyon mouth shall be made by New Mexico in accordance with the following schedule:\n\nDELIVERIES OF DIRECT FLOW TO COLORADO DURINGIRRIGATION SEASON\n\nUsable dischargeof creek atcanyon mouthgaging station(C.F.S.)\n\nIncrementalallocationsto Colorado(C.F.S.)\n\nPoint ofinterstatedelivery\n\nCumulativeallocationstoColorado(C.F.S.)\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAcequia Madre\n\nWhen the usable discharge of the creek is less than 25.00 C.F.S., deliver to Colorado 26.20 percent of usable discharge adjusted for transmission losses.\n\nCerro canal\n\nWhen the usable discharge of the creek is less than 25.00 C.F.S., deliver to Colorado 10.13 percent of usable discharge adjusted for transmission losses.\n\nAcequia Madre\n\nWhen the usable discharge of the creek is in excess of 25.38 C.F.S. and less than 36.88 C.F.S., deliver to Colorado 3.26 percent of usable discharge adjusted for transmission losses.\n\nCerro canal\n\nWhen the usable discharge of the creek is in excess of 25.38 C.F.S. and less than 36.88 C.F.S., deliver to Colorado 35.11 percent of usable discharge adjusted for transmission losses.\n\nWhen the usable discharge of the creek is in excess of 37.62 C.F.S. and less than 38.62 C.F.S., deliver to Colorado all of usable discharge adjusted for transmission losses.\n\nCerro canal\n\nWhen the usable discharge of the creek is in excess of 38.62 C.F.S. and less than 44.76 C.F.S., deliver to Colorado 36.5 percent of usable discharge adjusted for transmission losses.\n\nWhen the usable discharge of the creek is in excess of 44.91 C.F.S. and less than 50.91 C.F.S., deliver to Colorado all of usable discharge adjusted for transmission losses.\n\nCerro canal\n\nWhen the usable discharge of the creek is in excess of 55.35 C.F.S. and less than 56.48 C.F.S., deliver to Colorado 11.18 percent of usable discharge adjusted for transmission losses.\n\nWhen the usable discharge of the creek is in excess of 60.48 C.F.S. and less than 61.48 C.F.S., deliver to Colorado all of usable discharge adjusted for transmission losses.\n\nAt usable creek discharge of 64.22 C.F.S. the Cerro canal direct flow permit becomes operative after 1,000 acre-feet has been stored in Eastdale reservoir no. 1.\n\nCerro canal\n\nWhen the usable discharge of the creek is in excess of 64.22 C.F.S. and less than 139.70 C.F.S., deliver to Colorado 36.5 percent of usable discharge adjusted for transmission losses.\n\nThe actual discharges of Costilla creek at the canyon mouth gaging station at which the various blocks of direct flow water become effective shall equal the flows set forth in column (1) increased by the transmission losses necessary to deliver those flows to the headgates of the respective direct flow ditches.\n\nThe delivery of ditch water at the boundary shall equal the allocation set forth in column (2a) reduced by the transmission losses between the headgate of the ditch and the point where the ditch crosses the boundary. The allocations to be delivered to Colorado through the Cerro canal represent in each and all cases 36.5 percent of those blocks of direct flow water of the Costilla reservoir system which are subject to adjustment as provided in Subsection (e) of this article.\n\nThe delivery of water in the creek at the boundary shall equal the allocation set forth in column (2b) increased by the transmission losses between the boundary and the headgate of the Colorado ditch which is to receive the water.\n\nThe above table is compiled on the basis of the delivery to Colorado at the boundary of thirty-six and five-tenths percent (36.5%) of all direct flow water of the Costilla reservoir system diverted by the Cerro canal and the delivery at the boundary of all other direct flow water allocated to Colorado, in the order of priority, all such deliveries to be adjusted for transmission losses. In the event of change in the usable capacity of the Costilla reservoir, Colorado's share of Cerro canal diversions, to be delivered at the boundary and adjusted for transmission losses, shall be determined by the percentages set forth in column (4) of the table which appears in Subsection (e) of this article;\n\n(c) during the storage season, no water shall be diverted under direct flow rights unless there is water in excess of the demand of all operating reservoirs for water from Costilla creek for storage;\n\n(d) in order to assure the most efficient utilization of the available water supply, the filling of Eastdale reservoir no. 1 from Costilla creek shall be commenced as early in the spring as possible and shall be completed as soon thereafter as possible. The Cerro canal or any other ditch which may be provided for that purpose shall be used, insofar as practicable, to convey the water from the canyon mouth to Eastdale reservoir no. 1. During any season when the commission determines that there will be no surplus water, any diversions, waste or spill from any canal or canals supplying Eastdale reservoir no. 1 will be charged to the quantity of water diverted for delivery to said reservoir;\n\n(e) the commission shall estimate each year the safe yield of Costilla reservoir system and its component parts as far in advance of the irrigation season as possible, and shall review and revise such estimates from time to time as may be necessary.\n\nIn the event the usable capacity of the Costilla reservoir changes, the average safe yield and the equitable division thereof between the states shall be determined in accordance with the following table:\n\nDivision of Safe Yield\n\nof Costilla\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\n(acre-feet)\n\n(acre-feet)\n\n(acre-feet)\n\nIntermediate quantities shall be computed by proportionate parts.\n\nIn the event of change in the usable capacity of the Costilla reservoir, the Costilla reservoir complement of the Costilla reservoir system safe yield shall be divided between Colorado and New Mexico in accordance with the percentages given in columns 4 and 6, respectively, of the above table.\n\nEach state may draw from the reservoir in accordance with the allocations made herein, up to its proportion of the Costilla reservoir complement of the Costilla reservoir system safe yield and its proportion of temporary storage and no more. Colorado may call for the delivery of its share thereof at any of the specified points of interstate delivery.\n\nDeliveries of water from Costilla reservoir to the canyon mouth shall be adjusted for transmission losses, if any, between the two points. Deliveries to Colorado at the boundary shall be further adjusted for transmission losses from the canyon mouth to the respective points of interstate delivery.\n\nWater stored in Costilla reservoir and not released during the current season shall not be held over to the credit of either state but shall be apportioned when the safe yield is subsequently determined;\n\n(f) the Colorado apportionment of surplus water, as allocated in Article IV (f), shall be delivered by New Mexico at such points of interstate delivery and in the respective quantities, subject to transmission losses, requested by the Colorado member of the commission;\n\n(g) in the event that additional water becomes usable by the construction of additional storage facilities, such water shall be made available to each state in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the commission;\n\n(h) when it appears to the commission that any part of the water allocated to one state for use in a particular year will not be used by that state, the commission may permit its use by the other state during that year, provided that a permanent right to the use of such water shall not thereby be established.\n\nThe desirability of consolidating various of the direct flow ditches serving the Costilla-Garcia area, which are now or which would become interstate in character by consolidation, and diverting the water available to such ditches through a common headgate is recognized. Should the owners of any of such ditches, or a combination of them, desire to effectuate a consolidation and provide for a common headgate diversion, application therefor shall be made to the commission which, after review of the plans submitted, may grant permission to make such consolidation.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nThe commission shall cause to be maintained and operated a stream-gaging station, equipped with an automatic water-stage recorder, at each of the following points, to wit:\n\n(a) on Costilla creek immediately below Costilla reservoir;\n\n(b) on Costilla creek at or near the canyon mouth above the headgate of Cerro canal and below the Amalia area;\n\n(c) on Costilla creek at or near the boundary;\n\n(d) on the Cerro canal immediately below its headgate;\n\n(e) on the Cerro canal at or near the boundary;\n\n(f) on the intake from Costilla creek to the Eastdale reservoir no. 1, immediately above the point where the intake discharges into the reservoir;\n\n(g) on the Acequia Madre immediately below its headgate;\n\n(h) on the Acequia Madre at the boundary;\n\n(i) similar gaging stations shall be maintained and operated at such other points as may be necessary in the discretion of the commission for the securing of records required for the carrying out of the provisions of the compact.\n\nSuch gaging stations shall be equipped, maintained and operated by the commission directly or in cooperation with an appropriate federal or state agency, and the equipment, method and frequency of measurement at such stations shall be such as to produce reliable records at all times.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nThe two states shall administer this compact [this section] through the official in each state who is now or may hereafter be charged with the duty of administering the public water supplies, and such officials shall constitute the Costilla Creek Compact commission. In addition to the powers and duties hereinbefore specifically conferred upon such commission, the commission shall collect and correlate factual data and maintain records having a bearing upon the administration of this compact. In connection therewith, the commission may employ such engineering and other assistance as may be reasonably necessary within the limits of funds provided for that purpose by the states. The commission may, by unanimous action, adopt rules and regulations consistent with the provisions of this compact to govern its proceedings. The salaries and expenses of the members of the commission shall be paid by their respective states. Other expenses incident to the administration of the compact, including the employment of engineering or other assistance and the establishment and maintenance of compact gaging stations, not borne by the United States shall be assumed equally by the two states and paid directly to the commission upon vouchers submitted for that purpose.\n\nThe United States geological survey, or whatever federal agency may succeed to the functions and duties of that agency, shall collaborate with the commission in the correlation and publication of water facts necessary for the proper administration of this compact.\n\nThis compact shall become operative when ratified by the legislatures of each of the signatory states and consented to by the congress of the United States.\n\nIn witness whereof, the commissioners have signed this compact in triplicate original, one copy of which shall be deposited in the archives of the department of state of the United States of America, and one copy of which shall be forwarded to the governor of each of the signatory states.\n\nDone in the city of Santa Fe, New Mexico, on the 30th day of September, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and forty-four.\n\nCLIFFORD H.

The condition of Costilla dam may be such that the state engineer of New Mexico will not permit storage above a determined stage except for short periods of time;\n\n(h) the \"Cerro canal\" is that irrigation canal which diverts water from the left bank of Costilla creek in New Mexico near the southwest corner of section 12, township 1 south, range 73 west, of the Costilla Estates survey, and runs in a northwesterly direction to the boundary near boundary monument no. 140;\n\n(i) the \"boundary\" is the term used herein to describe the common boundary line between Colorado and New Mexico;\n\n(j) the term \"Costilla reservoir system\" means and includes the Costilla reservoir and the Cerro canal, the permits for the storage of water in Costilla reservoir, the twenty-four and fifty-two hundredths (24.52) cubic feet per second of time of direct flow water rights transferred to the Cerro canal, and the permits for the diversion of direct flow water by the Cerro canal as adjusted herein to seventy-five and forty-eight hundredths (75.48) cubic feet per second of time;\n\n(k) the term \"Costilla reservoir system safe yield\" means that quantity of usable water made available each year by the Costilla reservoir system. The safe yield represents the most beneficial operation of the Costilla reservoir system through the use, first, of the total usable portion of the yield of the twenty-four and fifty-two hundredths (24.52) cubic feet per second of time of direct flow rights transferred to the Cerro canal, second, of the total usable portion of the yield of the direct flow Cerro canal permits, and third, of that portion of the water stored in Costilla reservoir required to complete such safe yield;\n\n(l) the term \"usable capacity\" is defined and means that capacity of Costilla reservoir at the stage above which the state engineer of New Mexico will not permit storage except for short periods of time;\n\n(m) the term \"temporary storage\" is defined and means the water permitted by the state engineer of New Mexico to be stored in Costilla reservoir for short periods of time above the usable capacity of that reservoir;\n\n(n) the term \"additional storage facilities\" is defined and means storage capacity which may be provided in either state to impound waters of Costilla creek and its tributaries in addition to the nominal capacity of Costilla reservoir and the Costilla creek complement of the Eastdale reservoir no. 1 capacity;\n\n(o) the term \"duty of water\" is defined as the rate in cubic feet per second of time at which water may be diverted at the headgate to irrigate a specified acreage of land during the period of maximum requirement;\n\n(p) the term \"surplus water\" is defined and means water which cannot be stored in operating reservoirs during the storage season or water during the irrigation season which cannot be stored in operating reservoirs and which is in excess of the aggregate direct flow rights and permits recognized by this compact;\n\n(q) the term \"irrigation season\" is defined and means that period of each calendar year from May 16 to September 30, inclusive;\n\n(r) the term \"storage season\" is defined and means that period of time extending from October 1 of one year to May 15 of the succeeding year, inclusive;\n\n(s) the term \"points of interstate delivery\" means and includes:\n\n(1) the Acequia Madre where it crosses the boundary;\n\n(2) the Costilla creek where it crosses the boundary;\n\n(3) the Cerro canal where it reaches the boundary; and\n\n(4) any other interstate canals which might be constructed with the approval of the commission at the point or points where they cross the boundary;\n\n(t) the term \"water company\" means the San Luis Power and Water Company, a Colorado corporation, or its successor;\n\n(u) the word \"commission\" means the Costilla Creek Compact commission created by Article VIII of this compact for the administration thereof.\n\nARTICLE III\n\n1. To accomplish the purposes of this compact, as set forth in Article I, the following adjustments in the operation of irrigation facilities on Costilla creek, and in the use of water diverted, stored and regulated thereby, are made:\n\n(a) the quantity of water delivered for use in the two states by direct flow ditches in the Costilla-Garcia area and by the Cerro canal is based on a duty of water of one cubic foot per second of time for each eighty (80) acres, to be applied in the order of priority; provided, however, that this adjustment in each instance is based on the acreage as determined by the court in decreeing the water rights for the Costilla-Garcia area, and in the case of Cerro canal such basis shall apply to eight thousand (8,000) acres of land. In order to better maintain a usable head for the diversion of water for beneficial consumptive use the adjusted maximum diversion rate under the water right of each of the ditches supplying water for the Costilla-Garcia area in Colorado is not less than one cubic foot per second of time;\n\n(b) there is transferred from certain ditches in the Costilla-Garcia area twenty-four and fifty-two hundredths (24.52) cubic feet per second of time of direct flow water rights, which rights of use are held by the water company or its successors in title, to the headgate of the Cerro canal. The twenty-four and fifty-two hundredths (24.52) cubic feet of water per second of time hereby transferred represents an evaluation of these rights after adjustment in the duty of water, pursuant to Subsection (a) of this article, and includes a reduction thereof to compensate for increased use of direct flow water which otherwise would have been possible under these rights by this transfer;\n\n(c) except for the rights to store water from Costilla creek in Eastdale reservoir no. 1 as hereinafter provided, all diversion and storage rights from Costilla creek for Eastdale reservoirs no. 1 and no. 2 are relinquished and the water decreed thereunder is returned to the creek for use in accordance with the plan of integrated operation effectuated by this compact;\n\n(d) the Cerro canal direct flow permit shall be seventy-five and forty-eight hundredths (75.48) cubic feet per second of time;\n\n(e) there is transferred to and made available for the irrigation of lands in Colorado a portion of the Costilla reservoir complement of the Costilla reservoir system safe yield in order that the storage of water in that reservoir may be made for the benefit of water users in both Colorado and New Mexico under the provisions of this compact for the allocations of water and the operation of facilities.\n\n2. Each state grants for the benefit of the other and its water users the rights to change the points of diversion of water from Costilla creek, to divert water from the stream in one state for use in the other and to store water in one state for the irrigation of lands in the other, insofar as the exercise of such rights may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this article and to comply with the terms of this compact.\n\n3. The water company has consented to and approved the adjustments contained in this article; and such consent and approval shall be evidenced in writing and filed with the commission.\n\nThe apportionment and allocation of the use of Costilla creek water shall be as follows:\n\n(a) there is allocated for diversion from the natural flow of Costilla creek and its tributaries sufficient water for beneficial use on meadow and pasture lands above Costilla reservoir in New Mexico to the extent and in the manner now prevailing in that area;\n\n(b) there is allocated for diversion from the natural flow of Costilla creek and its tributaries thirteen and forty-two hundredths (13.42) cubic feet of water per second of time for beneficial use on lands in the Amalia area in New Mexico;\n\n(c) in addition to allocations made in Subsections (e), (f) and (g) of this article, there is allocated for diversion from the natural flow of Costilla creek fifty and sixty-two hundredths (50.62) cubic feet of water per second of time for Colorado and eighty-nine and eight hundredths (89.08) cubic feet of water per second of time for New Mexico, subject to adjustment as provided in Article V (e), and such water shall be delivered for beneficial use in the two states in accordance with the schedules and under the conditions set forth in Article V;\n\n(d) there is allocated for diversion from the natural flow of Costilla creek sufficient water to provide each year one thousand (1,000) acre-feet of stored water in Eastdale reservoir no. 1, such water to be delivered as provided in Article V;\n\n(e) there is allocated for diversion to Colorado thirty-six and five-tenths percent (36.5%) and to New Mexico sixty-three and five-tenths percent (63.5%) of the water stored by Costilla reservoir for release therefrom for irrigation purposes each year, subject to adjustment as provided in Article V (e) and such water shall be delivered for beneficial use in the two states on a parity basis in accordance with the provisions of Article V. By \"parity basis\" is meant that neither state shall enjoy a priority of right of use;\n\n(f) there is allocated for beneficial use in each of the states of Colorado and New Mexico one-half of the surplus water, as defined in Article II (p), to be delivered as provided in Article V;\n\n(g) there is allocated for beneficial use in each of the states of Colorado and New Mexico one-half of any water made available and usable by additional storage facilities which may be constructed in the future.\n\nThe operation of the facilities of Costilla creek and the delivery of water for the irrigation of land in Colorado and New Mexico, in accordance with the allocations made in Article IV, shall be as follows:\n\n(a) diversions of water for use on lands in the Amalia area shall be made as set forth in Article IV (b) in the order of decreed priorities in New Mexico and of relative priority dates in the two states, subject to the right of New Mexico to change the points of diversion and places of use of any of such water to other points of diversion and places of use; provided, however, that the rights so transferred shall be limited in each instance to the quantity of water actually consumed on the lands from which the right is transferred;\n\n(b) deliveries to Colorado of direct flow water below the canyon mouth shall be made by New Mexico in acocrdance [accordance] with the following schedule:\n\nDELIVERIES OF DIRECT FLOW TO COLORADO DURINGIRRIGATION SEASON\n\nUsable dischargeof creek atcanyon mouthgaging station(C.F.S.)\n\nIncrementalallocationsto Colorado(C.F.S.)\n\nPoint ofinterstatedelivery\n\nCumulativeallocationstoColorado(C.F.S.)\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAcequia Madre\n\nIncremental allocation is 4.2% of the usable discharge when usable discharge is less than 25.00 C.F.S.\n\nCerro canal\n\nIncremental allocation is 10.13% of the usable discharge when usable discharge is less than 25.00 C.F.S.\n\nCerro canal\n\nThis 4.70 C.F.S. is not a part of the Colorado allocation of the direct flow water of the Costilla reservoir system and is not subject to adjustment in the event of a change in the usable capacity of Costilla reservoir.

The allocations to be delivered to Colorado through the Cerro canal represent, except as otherwise indicated in column (5) of the table above, 36.5 percent of those blocks of direct flow water of the Costilla reservoir system which are subject to adjustment as provided in Subsection (e) of this article.\n\nThe provisions of Article III 1.(a) shall not be applicable to the Colorado allocation of 5.08 C.F.S. which is transferred from the Acequia Madre to the Cerro canal by this amendment to the Costilla Creek Compact and shall not be applicable to the 0.8 C.F.S. which is transferred from Colorado to New Mexico by this amendment to the Costilla Creek Compact.\n\nThe above table is compiled on the basis of the delivery to Colorado at the boundary of thirty-six and five-tenths percent (36.5%) of all direct flow water of the Costilla reservoir system diverted by the Cerro canal and the delivery at the boundary of all other direct flow water allocated to Colorado, in the order of priority, all such deliveries to be adjusted for transmission losses. In the event of change in the usable capacity of the Costilla reservoir, Colorado's share of all direct flow water of the Costilla reservoir system diverted by the Cerro canal, to be delivered at the boundary and adjusted for transmission losses, shall be determined by the percentages set forth in column (4) of the table which appears in Subsection (e) of this article;\n\n(c) during the storage season, no water shall be diverted under direct flow rights unless there is water in excess of the demand of all operating reservoirs for water from Costilla creek for storage;\n\n(d) in order to assure the most efficient utilization of the available water supply, the filling of Eastdale reservoir no. 1 from Costilla creek shall be commenced as early in the spring as possible and shall be completed as soon thereafter as possible. The Cerro canal or any other ditch which may be provided for that purpose shall be used, insofar as practicable, to convey the water from the canyon mouth to Eastdale reservoir no. 1. During any season when the commission determines that there will be no surplus water, any diversions, waste or spill from any canal or canals supplying Eastdale reservoir no. 1 will be charged to the quantity of water diverted for delivery to said reservoir;\n\n(e) the commission shall estimate each year the safe yield of Costilla reservoir system and its component parts as far in advance of the irrigation season as possible, and shall review and revise such estimates from time to time as may be necessary.\n\nIn the event the usable capacity of the Costilla reservoir changes, the average safe yield and the equitable division thereof between the states shall be determined in accordance with the following table:\n\nDivision of Safe Yield\n\nof Costilla\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\n(acre-feet)\n\n(acre-feet)\n\n(acre-feet)\n\nIntermediate quantities shall be computed by proportionate parts.\n\nIn the event of change in the usable capacity of the Costilla reservoir, the Costilla reservoir complement of the Costilla reservoir system safe yield shall be divided between Colorado and New Mexico in accordance with the percentages given in columns 4 and 6, respectively, of the above table.\n\nEach state may draw from the reservoir in accordance with the allocations made herein, up to its proportion of the Costilla reservoir complement of the Costilla reservoir system safe yield and its proportion of temporary storage and no more. Colorado may call for the delivery of its share thereof at any of the specified points of interstate delivery.\n\nDeliveries of water from Costilla reservoir to the canyon mouth shall be adjusted for transmission losses, if any, between the two points. Deliveries to Colorado at the boundary shall be further adjusted for transmission losses from the canyon mouth to the respective points of interstate delivery.\n\nWater stored in Costilla reservoir and not released during the current season shall not be held over to the credit of either state but shall be apportioned when the safe yield is subsequently determined;\n\n(f) the Colorado apportionment of surplus water, as allocated in Article IV (f), shall be delivered by New Mexico at such points of interstate delivery and in the respective quantities, subject to transmission losses, requested by the Colorado member of the commission;\n\n(g) in the event that additional water becomes usable by the construction of additional storage facilities, such water shall be made available to each state in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the commission;\n\n(h) when it appears to the commission that any part of the water allocated to one state for use in a particular year will not be used by that state, the commission may permit its use by the other state during that year, provided that a permanent right to the use of such water shall not thereby be established.\n\nThe desirability of consolidating various of the direct flow ditches serving the Costilla-Garcia area, which are now or which would become interstate in character by consolidation, and diverting the water available to such ditches through a common headgate is recognized. Should the owners of any of such ditches, or a combination of them, desire to effectuate a consolidation and provide for a common headgate diversion, application therefor shall be made to the commission which, after review of the plans submitted, may grant permission to make such consolidation.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nThe commission shall cause to be maintained and operated a stream-gaging station, equipped with an automatic water-stage recorder, at each of the following points, to wit:\n\n(a) on Costilla creek immediately below Costilla reservoir;\n\n(b) on Costilla creek at or near the canyon mouth above the headgate of Cerro canal and below the Amalia area;\n\n(c) on Costilla creek at or near the boundary;\n\n(d) on the Cerro canal immediately below its headgate;\n\n(e) on the Cerro canal at or near the boundary;\n\n(f) on the intake from Costilla creek to the Eastdale reservoir no. 1, immediately above the point where the intake discharges into the reservoir;\n\n(g) on the Acequia Madre immediately below its headgate;\n\n(h) on the Acequia Madre at the boundary;\n\n(i) similar gaging stations shall be maintained and operated at such other points as may be necessary in the discretion of the commission for the securing of records required for the carrying out of the provisions of the compact.\n\nSuch gaging stations shall be equipped, maintained and operated by the commission directly or in cooperation with an appropriate federal or state agency, and the equipment, method and frequency of measurement at such stations shall be such as to produce reliable records at all times.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nThe two states shall administer this compact [this section] through the official in each state who is now or may hereafter be charged with the duty of administering the public water supplies, and such officials shall constitute the Costilla Creek Compact commission. In addition to the powers and duties hereinbefore specifically conferred upon such commission, the commission shall collect and correlate factual data and maintain records having a bearing upon the administration of this compact. In connection therewith, the commission may employ such engineering and other assistance as may be reasonably necessary within the limits of funds provided for that purpose by the states. The commission may, by unanimous action, adopt rules and regulations consistent with the provisions of this compact to govern its proceedings. The salaries and expenses of the members of the commission shall be paid by their respective states. Other expenses incident to the administration of the compact, including the employment of engineering or other assistance and the establishment and maintenance of compact gaging stations, not borne by the United States shall be assumed equally by the two states and paid directly to the commission upon vouchers submitted for that purpose.\n\nThe United States geological survey, or whatever federal agency may succeed to the functions and duties of that agency, shall collaborate with the commission in the correlation and publication of water facts necessary for the proper administration of this compact.\n\nThis amended compact shall become operative when ratified by the legislatures of the signatory states and consented to by the congress of the United States; provided, that, except as changed herein, the provisions, terms, conditions and obligations of the Costilla Creek Compact executed on September 30, 1944, continue in full force and effect.\n\nIn witness whereof, the commissioners have signed this compact in triplicate original, one copy of which shall be deposited in the archives of the department of state of the United States of America, and one copy of which shall be forwarded to the governor of each of the signatory states.\n\nDone in the city of Santa Fe, New Mexico, on the 7th day of February, in the year of our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and sixty-three.\n\nJ.

Carpenter, for the state of Colorado; and\n\nStephen B. Davis, Jr., for the state of New Mexico;\n\nwho have agreed upon the following articles:\n\nThe state of Colorado, at its own expense, shall establish and maintain two permanent stream-gaging stations upon the La Plata river for the purpose of measuring and recording its flow, which shall be known as the Hesperus station and the Interstate station, respectively.\n\nThe Hesperus station shall be located at some convenient place near the village of Hesperus, Colorado. Suitable devices for ascertaining and recording the volume of all diversions from the river above Hesperus station, shall be established and maintained (without expense to the state of New Mexico), and whenever in this compact [this section] reference is made to the flow of the river at Hesperus station, it shall be construed to include the amount of the concurrent diversions above said station.\n\nThe Interstate station shall be located at some convenient place within one mile of, and above or below, the interstate line. Suitable devices for ascertaining and recording the volume of water diverted by the Enterprise and Pioneer canals, now serving approximately equal areas in both states, shall be established and maintained (without expense to the state of New Mexico), and whenever in this compact reference is made to the flow of the river at the Interstate station, it shall be construed to include one-half the volume of the concurrent diversions by such canals, and also the volume of any other water which may hereafter be diverted from said river in Colorado for use in New Mexico.\n\nEach of said stations shall be equipped with suitable devices for recording the flow of water in said river at all times between the 15th day of February and the 1st day of December of each year. The state engineers of the signatory states shall make provision for cooperative gaging at the two stations, for the details of the operation, exchange of records and data, and publication of the facts.\n\nThe waters of the La Plata river are hereby equitably apportioned between the signatory states, including the citizens thereof, as follows:\n\n1. at all times between the 1st day of December and the 15th day of the succeeding February, each state shall have the unrestricted right to the use of all water which may flow within its boundaries;\n\n2. by reason of the usual annual rise and fall, the flow of said river between the 15th day of February and the 1st day of December of each year, shall be apportioned between the states in the following manner:\n\n(a) each state shall have the unrestricted right to use all the waters within its boundaries on each day when the mean daily flow at the Interstate station is one hundred cubic feet per second, or more;\n\n(b) on all other days the state of Colorado shall deliver at the Interstate station a quantity of water equivalent to one-half of the mean flow at the Hesperus station for the preceding day, but not to exceed one hundred cubic feet per second;\n\n3. whenever the flow of the river is so low that in the judgment of the state engineers of the states, the greatest beneficial use of its waters may be secured by distributing all of its waters successively to the lands in each state in alternating periods, in lieu of delivery of water as provided in the second paragraph of this article, the use of the waters may be so rotated between the two states in such manner, for such periods, and to continue for such time as the state engineers may jointly determine;\n\n4. the state of New Mexico shall not at any time be entitled to receive nor shall the state of Colorado be required to deliver any water not then necessary for beneficial use in the state of New Mexico;\n\n5. a substantial delivery of water under the terms of this article shall be deemed a compliance with its provisions and minor and compensating irregularities in flow or delivery shall be disregarded.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nThe state engineers of the states by agreements, from time to time, may formulate rules and regulations for carrying out the provisions of this compact, which, when signed and promulgated by them, shall be binding until amended by agreement between them or until terminated by written notice from one to the other.\n\nWhenever any official of either state is designated to perform any duty under this compact [this section], such designation shall be interpreted to include the state official or officials upon whom the duties now performed by such official may hereafter devolve.\n\nThe physical and other conditions peculiar to the La Plata river and the territory drained and served thereby constitute the basis for this compact, and neither of the signatory states concedes the establishment of any general principle or precedent by the concluding of this compact.\n\nThis compact may be modified or terminated at any time by mutual consent of the signatory states and upon such termination all rights then established hereunder shall continue unimpaired.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nThis compact shall become operative when approved by the legislature of each of the signatory states and by the congress of the United States. Notice of approval by the legislatures shall be given by the governor of each state to the governor of the other state and the president of the United States is requested to give notice to governors of the signatory states of approval by the congress of the United States.\n\nIn witness whereof, the commissioners have signed this compact in duplicate originals, one of which shall be deposited with the secretary of state of each of the signatory states.\n\nDone at the city of Santa Fe, in the state of New Mexico, this twenty-seventh day of November, in the year of our Lord, one thousand nine hundred twenty-two.\n\nDELPH E.

state-line flows, quantities of water salvaged and quantities of unappropriated floodwaters shall be determined on the basis of three-year periods reckoned in continuing progressive series beginning with the first day of January next succeeding the ratification of this compact;\n\n(c) unless and until a more feasible method is devised and adopted by the commission the inflow-outflow method, as described in the report of the engineering advisory committee, shall be used to:\n\n(i) determine the effect of the state-line flow of any change in depletions by man's activities or otherwise, of the waters of the Pecos river in New Mexico;\n\n(ii) measure at or near the Avalon dam in New Mexico the quantities of waters salvaged;\n\n(iii) measure at or near the state line any water released from storage for the benefit of Texas as provided for in Subparagraph (d) of this article;\n\n(iv) measure the quantities of unappropriated floodwaters apportioned to Texas which have not been stored and regulated by reservoirs in New Mexico;\n\n(v) measure any other quantities of water required to be measured under the terms of this compact which are susceptible of being measured by the inflow-outflow method;\n\n(d) if unappropriated flood waters apportioned to Texas are stored in facilities constructed in New Mexico, the following principles shall apply:\n\n(i) in case of spill from a reservoir constructed in and operated by New Mexico, the water stored to the credit of Texas will be considered as the first water to spill;\n\n(ii) in case of spill from a reservoir jointly constructed and operated, the water stored to the credit of either state shall not be affected;\n\n(iii) reservoir losses shall be charged to each state in proportion to the quantity of water belonging to that state in storage at the time the losses occur;\n\n(iv) the water impounded to the credit of Texas shall be released by New Mexico on the demand of Texas;\n\n(e) water salvaged shall be measured at or near the Avalon dam in New Mexico and to the quantity thereof shall be added a quantity equal to the quantity of salvaged water depleted by man's activities above Avalon dam. The quantity of water salvaged that is apportioned to Texas shall be delivered by New Mexico at the New Mexico-Texas state line. The quantity of unappropriated floodwaters impounded under Paragraph (d) of this article, when released shall be delivered by New Mexico at the New Mexico-Texas state line in the quantity released less channel losses. The unappropriated floodwaters apportioned to Texas by this compact that are not impounded in reservoirs in New Mexico shall be measured and delivered at the New Mexico-Texas state line;\n\n(f) beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure and the limit of the right to use water.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nIn the event of importation of water by man's activities to the Pecos river basin from any other river basin the state making the importation shall have the exclusive use of such imported water.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nThe provisions of this compact [this section] shall not apply to, or interfere with, the right or power of either signatory state to regulate within its boundaries the appropriation, use and control of water, not inconsistent with its obligations under this compact.\n\nIn maintaining the flows at the New Mexico-Texas state line required by this compact, New Mexico shall in all instances apply the principle of prior appropriation within New Mexico.\n\nThe failure of either state to use the water, or any part thereof, the use of which is apportioned to it under the terms of this compact, shall not constitute a relinquishment of the right to such use, nor shall it constitute a forfeiture or abandonment of the right to such use.\n\nNothing in this compact shall be construed as:\n\n(a) affecting the obligations of the United States under the treaty with the United Mexican States (treaty series 994);\n\n(b) affecting any rights or powers of the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, in or to the waters of the Pecos river, or its capacity to acquire rights in and to the use of said waters;\n\n(c) subjecting any property of the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, to taxation by any state or subdivision thereof, or creating any obligation on the part of the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, by reason of the acquisition, construction or operation of any property or works of whatever kind, to make any payment to any state or political subdivision thereof, state agency, municipality or entity whatsoever, in reimbursement for the loss of taxes;\n\n(d) subjecting any property of the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, to the laws of any state to an extent other than the extent to which such laws would apply without regard to this compact.\n\nARTICLE XII\n\nThe consumptive use of water by the United States or any of its agencies, instrumentalities or wards shall be charged as a use by the state in which the use is made; provided, that such consumptive use incident to the diversion, impounding or conveyance of water in one state for use in the other state shall be charged to such latter state.\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\nThis compact shall not be construed as establishing any general principle or precedent applicable to other interstate streams.\n\nARTICLE XIV\n\nThis compact may be terminated at any time by appropriate action of the legislatures of both of the signatory states. In the event of such termination, all rights established under it shall continue unimpaired.\n\nThis compact shall become binding and obligatory when it shall have been ratified by the legislature of each state and approved by the congress of the United States. Notice of ratification by the legislature of each state shall be given by the governor of that state to the governor of the other state and to the president of the United States, and the president is hereby requested to give notice to the governor of each state of approval by the congress of the United States.\n\nIn witness whereof, the commissioners have executed three counterparts hereof each of which shall be and constitute an original, one of which shall be deposited in the archives of the department of state of the United States, and one of which shall be forwarded to the governor of each state.\n\nDone at the city of Santa Fe, state of New Mexico, this 3rd day of December, 1948.\n\n................................................................JOHN H. BLISSCommissioner for the state ofNew Mexico................................................................CHARLES H. MILLERCommissioner for the state of TexasAPPROVED............BERKELEY JOHNSONRepresentative of the United States of America\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 72-15-19, enacted by Laws 1949, ch. 6, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The first Pecos River Compact was ratified and approved, with reservations, by Laws 1933, ch. 166.\n\nIn Subparagraph (ii) of Paragraph (c) of Article IV of this compact, the words \" . . . water salvaged and appropriated floodwater . . . ' do not conform to the printed session laws of 1949. However, an error was made in the printing of the 1949 session laws. The word \"appropriated\" appears in the enrolled and engrossed bill which ratified this compact and should have appeared in the printed session laws instead of \"unappropriated.\" Thus, the language appearing in this section is correct.\n\nSettlement agreement is valid.— The settlement agreement among the United States, Carlsbad irrigation district, Pecos Valley artesian conservancy district, and the state of New Mexico, the governmental entities charged with responsibilities to administer and protect the valuable water resource provided by the Pecos river and its stream system, which establishes a managed water plan for the Pecos river, recognizes prior appropriation rights but subsumes individual interests to collective and representative bodies, and does not require a priority call, does not violate Article XVI, Section 2 of the New Mexico constitution or Article X of the Pecos River Compact.State ex rel. Office of the State Eng'r v. Lewis, 2007-NMCA-015, 141 N.M. 1, 150 P.3d 375.\n\nSupreme court's jurisdictionto resolve controversies between two states, U.S. Const., art. III, § 2, cl. 1, extends to a properly framed suit to apportion the waters of an interstate stream between states through which it flows, to a suit to enforce a prior apportionment, and to a suit by one state to enforce its compact with another state or to declare rights under a compact, such as thePecos River Compact. Tex. v. N.M., 462 U.S. 554, 103 S. Ct. 2558, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1983).\n\nReformation of compact is not within supreme court's equitable powers:It cannot appoint a tie-breaker or master to control the diversion of interstate waters on a day-to-day basis, even with the consent of the states involved.Tex. v. N.M., 462 U.S. 554, 103 S. Ct. 2558, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1983).\n\nRemedying past failures to perform.— There is nothing in the nature of compacts generally or of this compact in particular that counsels against rectifying a failure to perform in the past as well as ordering future performance called for by the compact.Tex. v. N.M., 482 U.S. 124, 107 S. Ct. 2279, 96 L. Ed. 2d 105 (1987).\n\nThe matter of remedying past water shortages caused by New Mexico's underdeliveries was returned to a special master for such further proceedings as he deemed necessary and for his ensuing recommendation as to whether New Mexico should be allowed to elect a monetary remedy and, if so, to suggest the size of the payment and other terms that the state must satisfy.Tex. v. N.M., 482 U.S. 124, 107 S. Ct. 2279, 96 L. Ed. 2d 105 (1987).\n\nGood faith belief in compliance.— New Mexico's good faith belief that it was complying with this compact would not permit the state to escape liability for what had been adjudicated to be past failures to perform its duties under the compact.Tex. v. N.M., 482 U.S. 124, 107 S. Ct. 2279, 96 L. Ed. 2d 105 (1987).\n\nDecree ordering state to comply with compact and appointing river master.Tex. v. N.M., 485 U.S. 388, 108 S. Ct. 1201, 99 L.

C. Hinderlider\n\nfor the state of New Mexico - Thomas M. McClure\n\nfor the state of Texas - Frank B. Clayton\n\nwho, after negotiations participated in by S. O. Harper, appointed by the president as the representative of the United States of America, have agreed upon the following articles, to wit:\n\n(a) The state of Colorado, the state of New Mexico, the state of Texas and the United States of America, are hereinafter designated \"Colorado,\" \"New Mexico,\" \"Texas\" and the \"United States,\" respectively.\n\n(b) \"The commission\" means the agency created by this compact [this section] for the administration thereof.\n\n(c) The term \"Rio Grande basin\" means all of the territory drained by the Rio Grande and its tributaries in Colorado, in New Mexico and in Texas above Fort Quitman, including the closed basin in Colorado.\n\n(d) The \"closed basin\" means that part of the Rio Grande basin in Colorado where the streams drain into the San Luis lakes and adjacent territory, and do not normally contribute to the flow of the Rio Grande.\n\n(e) The term \"tributary\" means any stream which naturally contributes to the flow of the Rio Grande.\n\n(f) \"Transmountain diversion\" is water imported into the drainage basin of the Rio Grande from any stream system outside of the Rio Grande basin, exclusive of the closed basin.\n\n(g) \"Annual debits\" are the amounts by which actual deliveries in any calendar year fall below scheduled deliveries.\n\n(h) \"Annual credits\" are the amounts by which actual deliveries in any calendar year exceed scheduled deliveries.\n\n(i) \"Accrued debits\" are the amounts by which the sum of all annual debits exceeds the sum of all annual credits over any common period of time.\n\n(j) \"Accrued credits\" are the amounts by which the sum of all annual credits exceeds the sum of all annual debits over any common period of time.\n\n(k) \"Project storage\" is the combined capacity of Elephant Butte reservoir and all other reservoirs actually available for the storage of usable water below Elephant Butte and above the first diversion to lands of the Rio Grande project, but not more than a total of 2,638,860 acre-feet.\n\n(l) \"Usable water\" is all water, exclusive of credit water, which is in project storage and which is available for release in accordance with irrigation demands, including deliveries in Mexico.\n\n(m) \"Credit water\" is that amount of water in project storage which is equal to the accrued credit of Colorado, or New Mexico, or both.\n\n(n) \"Unfilled capacity\" is the difference between the total physical capacity of project storage and the amount of usable water then in storage.\n\n(o) \"Actual release\" is the amount of usable water released in any calendar year from the lowest reservoir comprising project storage.\n\n(p) \"Actual spill\" is all water which is actually spilled from Elephant Butte reservoir, or is released therefrom for flood control, in excess of the current demand on project storage and which does not become usable water by storage in another reservoir;

in computing hypothetical spill the initial condition shall be the amount of usable water in project storage at the beginning of the calendar year following the effective date of this compact, and thereafter the initial condition shall be the amount of usable water in project storage at the beginning of the calendar year following each actual spill.\n\nThe commission shall cause to be maintained and operated a stream-gaging station equipped with an automatic water-stage recorder at each of the following points, to wit:\n\n(a) on the Rio Grande near Del Norte above the principal points of diversion to the San Luis valley;\n\n(b) on the Conejos river near Mogote;\n\n(c) on the Los Pinos river near Ortiz;\n\n(d) on the San Antonio river at Ortiz;\n\n(e) on the Conejos river at its mouth near Los Sauces;\n\n(f) on the Rio Grande near Lobatos;\n\n(g) on the Rio Chama below El Vado reservoir;\n\n(h) on the Rio Grande at Otowi bridge near San Ildefonso;\n\n(i) on the Rio Grande near San Acacio;\n\n(j) on the Rio Grande at San Marcial;\n\n(k) on the Rio Grande below Elephant Butte reservoir;\n\n(l) on the Rio Grande below Caballo reservoir.\n\nSimilar gaging stations shall be maintained and operated below any other reservoir constructed after 1929, and at such other points as may be necessary for the securing of records required for the carrying out of the compact; and automatic water-stage recorders shall be maintained and operated on each of the reservoirs mentioned, and on all others constructed after 1929.\n\nSuch gaging stations shall be equipped, maintained and operated by the commission directly or in cooperation with an appropriate federal or state agency, and the equipment, method and frequency of measurement at such stations shall be such as to produce reliable records at all times.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nThe obligation of Colorado to deliver water in the Rio Grande at the Colorado-New Mexico state line, measured at or near Lobatos, in each calendar year, shall be ten thousand acre-feet less than the sum of those quantities set forth in the two following tabulations of relationship, which correspond to the quantities at the upper index stations:\n\nDISCHARGE OF CONEJOS RIVERQuantities in thousands of acre-feet\n\nConejos index supply (1)\n\nConejos river at mouths (2)\n\nIntermediate quantities shall be computed by proportional parts.\n\n(1) Conejos index supply is the natural flow of Conejos river at the U.S.G.S. gaging station near Mogote during the calendar year, plus the natural flow of Los Pinos river at the U.S.G.S. gaging station near Ortiz and the natural flow of San Antonio river at the U.S.G.S. gaging station at Ortiz, both during the months of April to October, inclusive.\n\n(2) Conejos river at mouths is the combined discharge of branches of this river at the U.S.G.S. gaging stations near Los Sauces during the calendar year.\n\nDISCHARGE OF RIO GRANDE EXCLUSIVE OFCONEJOS RIVERQuantities in thousands of acre-feet\n\nRio Grande at Del Norte (3)\n\nRio Grande at Lobatosless Conejos at mouths (4)\n\nIntermediate quantities shall be computed by proportional parts.\n\n(3) Rio Grande at Del Norte is the recorded flow of the Rio Grande at the U.S.G.S. gaging station near Del Norte during the calendar year (measured above all principal points of diversion to San Luis valley) corrected for the operation of reservoirs constructed after 1937.\n\n(4) Rio Grande at Lobatos less Conejos at mouths is the total flow of the Rio Grande at the U.S.G.S. gaging station near Lobatos, less the discharge of Conejos river at its mouths, during the calendar year.\n\nThe application of these schedules shall be subject to the provisions hereinafter set forth and appropriate adjustments shall be made for (a) any change in location of gaging stations; (b) any new or increased depletion of the runoff above inflow index gaging stations; and (c) any transmountain diversions into the drainage basin of the Rio Grande above Lobatos.\n\nIn event any works are constructed after 1937 for the purpose of delivering water into the Rio Grande from the closed basin, Colorado shall not be credited with the amount of such water delivered, unless the proportion of sodium ions shall be less than forty-five percent of the total positive ions in that water when the total dissolved solids in such water exceeds three hundred fifty parts per million.\n\nThe obligation of New Mexico to deliver water in the Rio Grande at San Marcial, during each calendar year, exclusive of the months of July, August and September shall be that quantity set forth in the following tabulation of relationship, which corresponds to the quantity at the upper index station:\n\nDISCHARGE OF RIO GRANDE AT OTOWIBRIDGE AND AT SAN MARCIALEXCLUSIVE OF JULY, AUGUST AND SEPTEMBERQuantities in thousands of acre feet\n\nOtowi Index Supply (5)\n\nSan Marcial Index Supply (6)\n\nIntermediate quantities shall be computed by proportional parts.\n\n(5) The Otowi index supply is the recorded flow of the Rio Grande at the U.S.G.S. gaging station at Otowi bridge near San Ildefonso (formerly station near Buckman) during the calendar year, exclusive of the flow during the months of July, August and September, corrected for the operation of reservoirs constructed after 1929 in the drainage basin of the Rio Grande between Lobatos and Otowi bridge.\n\n(6) San Marcial index supply is the recorded flow of the Rio Grande at the gaging station at San Marcial during the calendar year exclusive of the flow during the months of July, August and September.\n\nThe application of this schedule shall be subject to the provisions hereinafter set forth and appropriate adjustments shall be made for (a) any change in location of gaging stations; (b) depletion after 1929 in New Mexico at any time of the year of the natural runoff at Otowi bridge; (c) depletion of the runoff during July, August and September of tributaries between Otowi bridge and San Marcial, by works constructed after 1937; and (d) any transmountain diversions into the Rio Grande between Lobatos and San Marcial.\n\nConcurrent records shall be kept of the flow of the Rio Grande at San Marcial, near San Acacio, and of the release from Elephant Butte reservoir, to the end that the records at these three stations may be correlated.\n\nIf at any time it should be the unanimous finding and determination of the commission that because of changed physical conditions, or for any other reasons, reliable records are not obtainable, or cannot be obtained, at any of the stream-gaging stations herein referred to, such stations may, with the unanimous approval of the commission, be abandoned, and with such approval another station, or other stations, shall be established and new measurements shall be substituted which, in the unanimous opinion of the commission, will result in substantially the same results, so far as the rights and obligations to deliver water are concerned, as would have existed if such substitution of stations and measurements had not been so made.\n\nCommencing with the year following the effective date of this compact, all credits and debits of Colorado and New Mexico shall be computed for each calendar year; provided, that in a year of actual spill no annual credits nor annual debits shall be computed for that year.\n\nIn the case of Colorado, no annual debit nor accrued debit shall exceed 100,000 acre-feet, except as either or both may be caused by holdover storage of water in reservoirs constructed after 1937 in the drainage basin of the Rio Grande above Lobatos. Within the physical limitations of storage capacity in such reservoirs, Colorado shall retain water in storage at all times to the extent of its accrued debit.\n\nIn the case of New Mexico, the accrued debit shall not exceed 200,000 acre-feet at any time, except as such debit may be caused by holdover storage of water in reservoirs constructed after 1929 in the drainage basin of the Rio Grande between Lobatos and San Marcial. Within the physical limitations of storage capacity in such reservoirs, New Mexico shall retain water in storage at all times to the extent of its accrued debit. In computing the magnitude of accrued credits or debits, New Mexico shall not be charged with any greater debit in any one year than the sum of 150,000 acre-feet and all gains in the quantity of water in storage in such year.\n\nThe commission by unanimous action may authorize the release from storage of any amount of water which is then being held in storage by reason of accrued debits of Colorado or New Mexico; provided, that such water shall be replaced at the first opportunity thereafter.\n\nIn computing the amount of accrued credits and accrued debits of Colorado or New Mexico, any annual credits in excess of 150,000 acre-feet shall be taken as equal to that amount.\n\nIn any year in which actual spill occurs, the accrued credits of Colorado, or New Mexico, or both, at the beginning of the year shall be reduced in proportion to their respective credits by the amount of such actual spill; provided, that the amount of actual spill shall be deemed to be increased by the aggregate gain in the amount of water in storage, prior to the time of spill, in reservoirs above San Marcial constructed after 1929; provided, further, that if the commissioners for the states having accrued credits authorized the release of part, or all, of such credits in advance of spill, the amount so released shall be deemed to constitute actual spill.\n\nIn any year in which there is actual spill of usable water, or at the time of hypothetical spill thereof, all accrued debits of Colorado, or New Mexico, or both, at the beginning of the year shall be canceled.\n\nIn any year in which the aggregate of accrued debits of Colorado and New Mexico exceeds the minimum unfilled capacity of project storage, such debits shall be reduced proportionally to an aggregate amount equal to such minimum unfilled capacity.\n\nTo the extent that accrued credits are impounded in reservoirs between San Marcial and Courchesne, and to the extent that accrued debits are impounded in reservoirs above San Marcial, such credits and debits shall be reduced annually to compensate for evaporation losses in the proportion that such credits or debits bore to the total amount of water in such reservoirs during the year.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nNeither Colorado nor New Mexico shall increase the amount of water in storage in reservoirs constructed after 1929 whenever there is less than 400,000 acre-feet of usable water in project storage; provided, that if the actual releases of usable water from the beginning of the calendar year following the effective date of this compact, or from the beginning of the calendar year following actual spill, have aggregated more than an average of 790,000 acre-feet per annum, the time at which such minimum stage is reached shall be adjusted to compensate for the difference between the total actual release and releases at such average rate; provided, further, that Colorado or New Mexico, or both, may relinquish accrued credits at any time, and Texas may accept such relinquished water, and in such event the state, or states, so relinquishing shall be entitled to store water in the amount of the water so relinquished.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nDuring the month of January of any year the commissioner for Texas may demand of Colorado and New Mexico, and the commissioner for New Mexico may demand of Colorado, the release of water from storage reservoirs constructed after 1929 to the amount of the accrued debits of Colorado and New Mexico, respectively, and such releases shall be made by each at the greatest rate practicable under the conditions then prevailing, and in proportion to the total debit of each, and in amounts, limited by their accrued debits, sufficient to bring the quantity of usable water in project storage to 600,000 acre-feet by March first and to maintain this quantity in storage until April thirtieth, to the end that a normal release of 790,000 acre-feet may be made from project storage in that year.\n\nColorado agrees with New Mexico that in event the United States or the state of New Mexico decides to construct the necessary works for diverting the waters of the San Juan river, or any of its tributaries, into the Rio Grande, Colorado hereby consents to the construction of said works and the diversion of waters from the San Juan river, or the tributaries thereof, into the Rio Grande in New Mexico, provided the present and prospective uses of water in Colorado by other diversions from the San Juan river, or its tributaries, are protected.\n\nIn the event water from another drainage basin shall be imported into the Rio Grande basin by the United States or Colorado or New Mexico, or any of them jointly, the state having the right to the use of such water shall be given proper credit therefor in the application of the schedules.\n\nNew Mexico and Texas agree that upon the effective date of this compact [this section] all controversies between said states relative to the quantity or quality of the water of the Rio Grande are composed and settled; however, nothing herein shall be interpreted to prevent recourse by a signatory state to the supreme court of the United States for redress should the character or quality of the water, at the point of delivery, be changed hereafter by one signatory state to the injury of another. Nothing herein shall be construed as an admission by any signatory state that the use of water for irrigation causes increase of salinity for which the user is responsible in law.\n\nARTICLE XII\n\nTo administer the provisions of this compact there shall be constituted a commission composed of one representative from each state, to be known as the Rio Grande Compact commission. The state engineer of Colorado shall be ex-officio the Rio Grande Compact commissioner for Colorado. The state engineer of New Mexico shall be ex-officio the Rio Grande Compact commissioner for New Mexico. The Rio Grande Compact commissioner for Texas shall be appointed by the governor of Texas. The president of the United States shall be requested to designate a representative of the United States to sit with such commission, and such representative of the United States, if so designated by the president, shall act as chairman of the commission without vote.\n\nThe salaries and personal expenses of the Rio Grande Compact commissioners for the three states shall be paid by their respective states, and all other expenses incident to the administration of this compact, not borne by the United States, shall be borne equally by the three states.\n\nThere shall be established and maintained a fund, to be known as the Rio Grande Compact fund, and all expenses incident to the administration of the compact, other than the salaries and personal expenses of the commissioners, shall be paid out of this fund on order of the commission. Each of the three states shall deposit the sum of five thousand ($5,000.00) dollars in the Rio Grande Compact fund and each state shall reimburse this fund quarterly upon presentation of claims by the commission setting forth in reasonable detail the expenses paid by the commission from this fund.\n\nIn addition to the powers and duties hereinbefore specifically conferred upon such commission, and the members thereof, the jurisdiction of such commission shall extend only to the collection, correlation and presentation of factual data and the maintenance of records having a bearing upon the administration of this compact, and, by unanimous action, to the making of recommendations to the respective states upon matters connected with the administration of this compact. In connection therewith, the commission may employ such engineering and clerical aid as may be reasonably necessary within the limit of funds provided for that purpose by the respective states. Annual reports compiled for each calendar year shall be made by the commission and transmitted to the governors of the signatory states on or before March first following the year covered by the report. The commission may, by unanimous action, adopt rules and regulations consistent with the provisions of this compact to govern their proceedings.\n\nThe findings of the commission shall not be conclusive in any court or tribunal which may be called upon to interpret or enforce this compact.\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\nAt the expiration of every five-year period after the effective date of this compact, the commission may, by unanimous consent, review any provisions hereof which are not substantive in character and which do not affect the basic principles upon which the compact is founded, and shall meet for the consideration of such questions on the request of any member of the commission; provided, however, that the provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect until changed and amended within the intent of the compact by unanimous action of the commissioners, and until any changes in this compact are ratified by the legislatures of the respective states and consented to by the congress, in the same manner as this compact is required to be ratified to become effective.\n\nARTICLE XIV\n\nThe schedules herein contained and the quantities of water herein allocated shall never be increased nor diminished by reason of any increase or diminution in the delivery or loss of water to Mexico.\n\nThe physical and other conditions characteristic of the Rio Grande and peculiar to the territory drained and served thereby, and to the development thereof, have actuated this compact and none of the signatory states admits that any provisions herein contained establishes any general principle or precedent applicable to other interstate streams.\n\nARTICLE XVI\n\nNothing in this compact shall be construed as affecting the obligations of the United States of America to Mexico under existing treaties, or to the Indian tribes, or as impairing the rights of the Indian tribes.\n\nARTICLE XVII\n\nThis compact shall become effective when ratified by the legislatures of each of the signatory states and consented to by the congress of the United States. Notice of ratification shall be given by the governor of each state to the governors of the other states and to the president of the United States, and the president of the United States is requested to give notice to the governors of each of the signatory states of the consent of the congress of the United States.\n\nIn witness whereof, the commissioners have signed this compact in quadruplicate original, one of which shall be deposited in the archives of the department of state of the United States of America and shall be deemed the authoritative original, and of which a duly certified copy shall be forwarded to the governor of each of the signatory states.\n\nDone at the city of Santa Fe, in the state of New Mexico, on the 18th day of March, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight.\n\n(Sgd.)

Neither of the other two member-states approved amendments of the compact similar to Laws 1945, ch. 60, and that amendment was not consented to by the United States congress. In light of these developments, the amendment of Article XII is of no force and effect.\n\nThe following resolution, adopted by the Rio Grande compact commission at its February 14-16, 1949, meeting revised the measurement of deliveries by New Mexico and the schedule shown in Article IV of the compact:\n\n\"RESOLUTION\n\n\"Whereas, at the Annual Meeting of the Rio Grande Compact Commission in the year 1945, the question was raised as to whether or not a schedule for delivery of water by New Mexico during the entire year could be worked out, and\n\n\"Whereas, at said meeting the question was referred to the Engineering Advisers for their study, recommendations and report, and\n\n\"Whereas, said Engineering Advisers have met, studied the problems and under date of February 24, 1947, did submit their Report, which said Report contains the findings of said Engineering Advisers and their recommendations, and\n\n\"Whereas, the Compact Commission has examined said Report and finds that the matters and things therein found and recommended are proper and within the terms of the Rio Grande Compact, and\n\n\"Whereas, the Commission has considered said Engineering Advisers' Report and all available evidence, information and material and is fully advised:\n\n\"Now, Therefore, Be it Resolved:\n\n\"The Commission finds as follows:\n\n\"(a) That because of change of physical conditions, reliable records of the amount of water passing San Marcial are no longer obtainable at the stream gaging station at San Marcial and that the same should be abandoned for Compact purposes.\n\n\"(b) That the need for concurrent records at San Marcial and San Acacia no longer exists and that the gaging station at San Acacia should be abandoned for Compact purposes.\n\n\"(c) That it is desirable and necessary that the obligations of New Mexico under the Compact to deliver water in the months of July, August, September, should be scheduled.\n\n(d) That the change in gaging stations and substitution of the new measurements as hereinafter set forth will result in substantially the same results so far as the rights and obligations to deliver water are concerned, and would have existed if such substitution of stations and measurements had not been so made.\n\n\"Be it Further Resolved:\n\n\"That the following measurements and schedule thereof shall be substituted for the measurements and schedule thereof as now set forth in Article IV of the Compact:\n\n\" 'The obligation of New Mexico to deliver water in the Rio Grande into Elephant Butte Reservoir during each calendar year shall be measured by that quantity set forth in the following tabulation of relationship which corresponds to the quantity at the upper index station:\n\n'DISCHARGE OF RIO GRANDE AT OTOWI BRIDGE AND ELEPHANT BUTTE EFFECTIVE SUPPLY\n\n\" 'Quantities in thousands of acre-feet\n\nOtowi index supply (5) Elephant Butte EffectiveIndex Supply (6)\" '100 57200 114300 171400 228500 286600 345700 406800 471900 5421,000 6211,100 7071,200 8001,300 8971,400 9961,500 1,0951,600 1,1951,700 1,2951,800 1,3951,900 1,4952,000 1,5952,100 1,6952,200 1,7952,300 1,8952,400 1,9952,500 2,0952,600 2,1952,700 2,2952,800 2,3952,900 2,4953,000 2,595\n\n\" 'Intermediate quantities shall be computed by proportional parts.\n\n\" '(5) The Otowi Index Supply is the recorded flow of the Rio Grande at the U.S.G.S. gaging station at Otowi Bridge near San Ildefonso (formerly station near Buckman) during the calendar year, corrected for the operation of reservoirs constructed after 1929 in the drainage basin of the Rio Grande between Lobatos and Otowi Bridge.\n\n\" '(6) Elephant Butte Effective Index Supply is the recorded flow of the Rio Grande at the gaging station below Elephant Butte Dam during the calendar year plus the net gain in storage in Elephant Butte Reservoir during the same year or minus the net loss in storage in said reservoir, as the case may be.\n\n\" 'The application of this schedule shall be subject to the provisions hereinafter set forth and appropriate adjustments shall be made for (a) any change in location of gaging stations;

provided, that in determining such relation the uses of water under rights perfected prior to November 24, 1922, shall be excluded.\n\n(a) All losses of water occurring from or as the result of the storage of water in reservoirs constructed prior to the signing of this compact shall be charged to the state in which such reservoir or reservoirs are located. Water stored in reservoirs covered by this Paragraph (a) shall be for the exclusive use of and shall be charged to the state in which the reservoir or reservoirs are located.\n\n(b) All losses of water occurring from or as the result of the storage of water in reservoirs constructed after the signing of this compact shall be charged as follows:\n\n(1) if the commission finds that the reservoir is used, in whole or in part, to assist the states of the upper division in meeting their obligations to deliver water at Lee Ferry imposed by Article III of the Colorado River Compact, the commission shall make findings, which in no event shall be contrary to the laws of the United States of America under which any reservoir is constructed, as to the reservoir capacity allocated for that purpose. The whole or that proportion, as the case may be, of reservoir losses as found by the commission to be reasonably and properly chargeable to the reservoir or reservoir capacity utilized to assure deliveries at Lee Ferry shall be charged to the states of the upper division in the proportion which the consumptive use of water in each state of the upper division during the water year in which the charge is made bears to the total consumptive use of water in all states of the upper division during the same water year. Water stored in reservoirs or in reservoir capacity covered by this Subparagraph (b) (1) shall be for the common benefit of all of the states of the upper division;\n\n(2) if the commission finds that the reservoir is used, in whole or in part, to supply water for use in a state of the upper division, the commission shall make findings, which in no event shall be contrary to the laws of the United States of America under which any reservoir is constructed, as to the reservoir or reservoir capacity utilized to supply water for use and the state in which such water will be used. The whole or that proportion, as the case may be, of reservoir losses as found by the commission to be reasonably and properly chargeable to the state in which such water will be used shall be borne by that state. As determined by the commission, water stored in reservoirs covered by this Subparagraph (b) (2) shall be earmarked for and charged to the state in which the water will be used.\n\n(c) In the event the commission finds that a reservoir site is available both to assure deliveries at Lee Ferry and to store water for consumptive use in a state of the upper division, the storage of water for consumptive use shall be given preference. Any reservoir or reservoir capacity hereafter used to assure deliveries at Lee Ferry shall by order of the commission be used to store water for consumptive use in a state, provided the commission finds that such storage is reasonably necessary to permit such state to make the use of the water apportioned to it by this compact.\n\nThe commission shall determine the quantity of the consumptive use of water, which use is apportioned by Article III hereof, for the upper basin and for each state of the upper basin by the inflow-outflow method in terms of man-made depletions of the virgin flow at Lee Ferry, unless the commission, by unanimous action, shall adopt a different method of determination.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nThe consumptive use of water by the United States of America or any of its agencies, instrumentalities or wards shall be charged as a use by the state in which the use is made; provided, that such consumptive use incident to the diversion, impounding or conveyance of water in one state for use in another shall be charged to such latter state.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\n(a) There is hereby created an interstate administrative agency to be known as the \"upper Colorado river commission.\" The commission shall be composed of one commissioner representing each of the states of the upper division, namely, the states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, designated or appointed in accordance with the laws of each state and, if designated by the president, one commissioner representing the United States of America.

On or before December 1 of each year, the commission shall adopt and transmit to the governors of the four states and to the president a budget covering an estimate of its expenses for the following year, and of the amount payable by each state. Each state shall pay the amount due by it to the commission on or before April 1 of the year following. The payment of the expenses of the commission and of its employees shall not be subject to the audit and accounting procedures of any of the four states; however, all receipts and disbursement of funds handled by the commission shall be audited yearly by a qualified independent public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become a part of the annual report of the commission.\n\n(c) The commission shall appoint a secretary, who shall not be a member of the commission, or an employee of any signatory state or of the United States of America while so acting. He shall serve for such term and receive such salary and perform such duties as the commission may direct. The commission may employ such engineering, legal, clerical and other personnel as, in its judgment, may be necessary for the performance of its functions under this compact.

Such rights shall be subject to the rights of water users, in a state in which such reservoir or works are located, to receive and use water, the use of which is within the apportionment to such state by this compact.\n\n(b) Any signatory state, any person or any entity of any signatory state shall have the right to acquire such property rights as are necessary to the use of water in conformity with this compact in any other signatory state by donation, purchase or through the exercise of the power of eminent domain. Any signatory state, upon the written request of the governor of any other signatory state, for the benefit of whose water users property is to be acquired in the state to which such written request is made, shall proceed expeditiously to acquire the desired property either by purchase at a price satisfactory to the requesting state, or, if such purchase cannot be made, then through the exercise of its power of eminent domain and shall convey such property to the requesting state or such entity as may be designated by the requesting state; provided, that all costs of acquisition and expenses of every kind and nature whatsoever incurred in obtaining the requested property shall be paid by the requesting state at the time and in the manner prescribed by the state requested to acquire the property.\n\n(c) Should any facility be constructed in a signatory state by and for the benefit of another signatory state or states or the water users thereof, as above provided, the construction, repair, replacement, maintenance and operation of such facility shall be subject to the laws of the state in which the facility is located, except that, in the case of a reservoir constructed in one state for the benefit of another state or states, the water administration officials of the state in which the facility is located shall permit the storage and release of any water which, as determined by findings of the commission, falls within the apportionment of the state or states for whose benefit the facility is constructed. In the case of a regulating reservoir for the joint benefit of all states in making Lee Ferry deliveries, the water administration officials of the state in which the facility is located, in permitting the storage and release of water, shall comply with the findings and orders of the commission.\n\n(d) In the event property is acquired by a signatory state in another signatory state for the use and benefit of the former, the users of water made available by such facilities, as a condition precedent to the use thereof, shall pay to the political subdivisions of the state in which such works are located, each and every year during which such rights are enjoyed for such purposes, a sum of money equivalent to the average annual amount of taxes levied and assessed against the land and improvements thereon during the ten years preceding the acquisition of such land. Said payments shall be in full reimbursement for the loss of taxes in such political subdivisions of the state, and in lieu of any and all taxes on said property, improvements and rights. The signatory states recommended [recommend] to the president and the congress that, in the event the United States of America shall acquire property in one of the signatory states for the benefit of another signatory state, or its water users, provision be made for like payment in reimbursement of loss of taxes.\n\n(a) The signatory states recognize La Plata River Compact [72-15-16 to 72-15-18 NMSA 1978] entered into between the states of Colorado and New Mexico, dated November 27, 1922, approved by the congress on January 29, 1925 (43 Stat. 796), and this compact [this section] shall not affect the apportionment therein made.\n\n(b) All consumptive use of water of La Plata river and its tributaries shall be charged under the apportionment of Article III hereof to the state in which the use is made; provided, that consumptive use incident to the diversion, impounding or conveyance of water in one state for use in the other shall be charged to the latter state.\n\nSubject to the provisions of this compact, the consumptive use of the water of the Little Snake river and its tributaries is hereby apportioned between the states of Colorado and Wyoming in such quantities as shall result from the application of the following principles and procedures:\n\n(a) water used under rights existing prior to the signing of this compact:\n\n(1) water diverted from any tributary of the Little Snake river or from the main stem of the Little Snake river above a point one hundred feet below the confluence of Savery creek and the Little Snake river shall be administered without regard to rights covering the diversion of water from any downstream points;\n\n(2) water diverted from the main stem of the Little Snake river below a point of one hundred feet below the confluence of Savery creek and the Little Snake river shall be administered on the basis of an interstate priority schedule prepared by the commission in conformity with priority dates established by laws of the respective states;\n\n(b) water used under rights initiated subsequent to the signing of this compact:\n\n(1) direct flow diversions shall be so administered that, in time of shortage, the curtailment of use on each acre of land irrigated thereunder shall be as nearly equal as may be possible in both of the states;\n\n(2) the storage of water by projects located in either state, whether of supplemental supply or of water used to irrigate land not irrigated at the date of the signing of this compact, shall be so administered that in times of water shortage the curtailment of storage of water available for each acre of land irrigated thereunder shall be as nearly equal as may be possible in both states;\n\n(c) water uses under the apportionment made by this article shall be in accordance with the principle that beneficial use shall be the basis, measure and limit of the right to use;\n\n(d) the states of Colorado and Wyoming each assent to diversions and storage of water in one state for use in the other state, subject to compliance with Article IX of this compact;\n\n(e) in the event of the importation of water to the Little Snake river basin from any other river basin, the state making the importation shall have the exclusive use of such imported water unless by written agreement, made by the representatives of the states of Colorado and Wyoming on the commission, it is otherwise provided;\n\n(f) water use projects initiated after the signing of this compact, to the greatest extent possible, shall permit the full use within the basin in the most feasible manner of the waters of the Little Snake river and its tributaries, without regard to the state line; and, so far as is practicable, shall result in an equal division between the states of the use of water not used under rights existing prior to the signing of this compact;\n\n(g) all consumptive use of the waters of the Little Snake river and its tributaries shall be charged under the apportionment of Article III hereof to the state in which the use is made;
