Tondre, 1913-NMSC-067, 18 N.M. 388, 137 P. 86.\n\nSections compared.— Substance and intent of Section 72-12-4 NMSA 1978 and this section are the same.State ex rel. Reynolds v.

Reynolds, 1962-NMSC-173, 71 N.M. 428, 379 P.2d 73.\n\nRelation back of prior claim.— If claim to water was actually initiated prior to March 19, 1907, then right to appropriate would relate back to initiation of claim upon diligent prosecution to completion of necessary surveys and construction for application of water to beneficial use.Farmers Dev. Co. v. Rayado Land & Irrigation Co., 1923-NMSC-004, 28 N.M. 357, 213 P. 202, explained,State ex rel. Reynolds v.

Reynolds v. Mendenhall, 1961-NMSC-083, 68 N.M. 467, 362 P.2d 998.\n\nDismissal of action improper.— Where neither party had filed application to appropriate water prior to plaintiff's bringing of suit to enforce appropriation rights, trial court should not have dismissed action for plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative remedies; failure to obtain permit would not necessarily affect acquisition of water rights by appropriation.May v. Torres, 1974-NMSC-018, 86 N.M. 62, 519 P.2d 298.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Water Rights Problems in the Upper Rio Grande Watershed and Adjoining Areas,\" see 11 Nat.

Acequia Mesa Del Medio, 2024-NMCA-043, cert. denied.\n\nThe district court retained subject matter jurisdiction because it did not adjudicate or readjudicate water rights.— Where the governing body of the acequia mesa del medio (AMM) issued a new irrigation schedule, reducing plaintiffs' irrigation time from the acequia, and where plaintiffs brought an action against AMM seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, disputing how AMM distributes water to the holders of ditch rights and how AMM assigns a particular time period for taking water from the acequia to each member of the association, and where the district court, in granting AMM's motion for summary judgment, made determinations about the ownership of some of the land that a 1962 court case identified as having an appurtenant water right, and where plaintiffs argued that the district court overstepped its subject matter jurisdiction by entering seven orders that readjudicated water rights that had been adjudicated in the 1962 court case, the district court did not overstep its jurisdiction because the district court did not adjudicate or readjudicate water rights that had already been adjudicated by the 1962 court case, but merely dismissed the claim for declaratory relief because plaintiffs failed to carry their burden in opposing summary judgment.Lujan v. Acequia Mesa Del Medio, 2024-NMCA-043, cert. denied.\n\nAuthority not impaired.— Nothing in this section shall be taken to impair authority of state engineer and watermaster to regulate distribution of water from various stream systems of state to ditches and irrigation systems entitled to water therefrom. 1953 Op.

Any stockmen or stock owners desiring to impound any of the surface waters of the state for watering of livestock shall apply to the state engineer on a form prescribed by the state engineer. If the capacity of the proposed impoundment is ten acre-feet or less, the applicant shall meet the requirements of this section. If the capacity of the proposed impoundment exceeds ten acre-feet, the applicant shall meet the requirements of filing applications for the appropriation and use of water pursuant to Section 72-5-1, 72-5-22, 72-5-23 or 72-5-24 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. Upon the filing of an application pursuant to this section, if the state engineer finds that the capacity of the proposed impoundment is ten acre-feet or less, will not be on a perennial stream and will be used for watering of livestock as defined in Subsection D of this section, the state engineer shall issue a permit to the applicant to impound and use the waters applied for; provided that as part of an application for an impoundment on state or federal land, the applicant submits proof that the applicant is legally entitled to place livestock on the state or federal land where the water is to be impounded and has been granted access to the site and has permission to occupy the portion of the state or federal land as is necessary for the impoundment.\n\nC. This section shall only apply to impoundments constructed for the watering of livestock after the effective date of this 2004 act.\n\nD. As used in this section, \"livestock\" means \"livestock\" as defined in Section 77-2-1.1 NMSA 1978 and this section applies only to the impoundment of surface water for the purpose of watering livestock. Watering of livestock does not include an impoundment of surface or ground water in any amount for fishing, fish propagation, recreation or aesthetic purposes, which shall require a permit pursuant to Section 72-5-1 NMSA 1978. In determining whether an impoundment will be used for the watering of livestock, the state engineer may consider the maximum amount of water required per livestock unit and shall take into account regional and climatic conditions that affect consumption.\n\nHistory:Laws 1907, ch. 49, § 74, enacted by Laws 1909, ch. 54, § 1; Code 1915, § 5730; C.S. 1929, § 151-179; Laws 1941, ch. 126, § 24; 1941 Comp., § 77-803; 1953 Comp., § 75-8-3; 2004, ch. 86, § 2.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The 1915 Code compilers substituted the term \"this article\" for \"this act.\" \"This act\" would refer to Laws 1907, ch. 49, the provisions of which are presently compiled as 19-7-26, 72-1-1, 72-1-2, 72-1-5, 72-2-1 to 72-2-7, 72-2-9, 72-2-10, 72-3-1 to 72-3-5, 72-4-1, 72-4-13, 72-4-15, 72-4-17 to 72-4-19, 72-5-1, 72-5-3, 72-5-4, 72-5-6 to 72-5-24, 72-5-26 to 72-5-28, 72-5-33, 72-7-1 to 72-7-3, 72-8-1 to 72-8-6, 72-9-1 to 72-9-3 NMSA 1978. \"This article\" would refer to the same sections and, in addition, to 72-5-2, 72-5-29 to 72-5-31 NMSA 1978.\n\nCross references.— For definition of acre-foot,see72-5-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2004 amendments,effective May 19, 2004, added Subsections A through D. Prior to the 2004 amendments, this section read: \"This article shall not be construed to apply to stockmen or stock owners who may build or construct water tanks or ponds for the purpose of watering stock, which have a capacity of ten acre-feet of water or less\".\n\nUse of water for watering stock is \"beneficial use\".First State Bank v.
