      "text": "Any person, association or corporation, public or private, the state of New Mexico or the United States of America, except as provided in Section 15 [72-5-33 NMSA 1978] of this act, hereafter intending to acquire the right to the beneficial use of any waters, shall, before commencing any construction for such purposes, make an application to the state engineer for a permit to appropriate, in the form required by the rules and regulations established by him. Such rules and regulations, shall, in addition to providing the form and manner of preparing and presenting the application, require the applicant to state the amount of water and period or periods of annual use, and all other data necessary for the proper description and limitation of the right applied for, together with such information, maps, field notes, plans and specifications as may be necessary to show the method of practicability of the construction and the ability of the applicant to complete the same. The state engineer may require additional information not provided for in the general rules and regulations, in any case involving the diversion of five hundred cubic feet of water per second, or more, or in the construction of a dam more than thirty feet high from the foundation. All such maps, field notes, plans and specifications, shall be made from actual surveys and measurements, and shall be duly filed in the office of the state engineer at the time of filing of formal application for permit to appropriate; provided, that upon the filing in the office of the state engineer of a notice of intention to make formal application for a permit to appropriate certain public waters the state engineer may allow a reasonable time, to be specified by him and noted upon his records, for making the surveys, measurements, maps, plans and specifications hereinbefore provided and required for a formal application, and if applicant shall file such formal application and map, plans and specifications and other necessary data within the time so specified, his priority of application shall date from the time of filing such notice of intention.\n\nHistory:Laws 1907, ch. 49, § 24; 1913, ch. 62, § 2; Code 1915, § 5678; C.S. 1929, § 151-129; Laws 1941, ch. 126, § 6; 1941 Comp., § 77-501; 1953 Comp., § 75-5-1.\n\nCross references.— For prohibition against constructing works without permit,see72-8-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor applications for the transportation and use of public waters outside the state,see72-12B-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the state engineer,see72-2-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nSubject matter jurisdiction.— The state engineer has subject matter jurisdiction to review an application irrespective of the applicant making specific reference to, or invocation of, any statutory section in the application, so long as the application seeks permission to do something within the statutory and regulatory authority of the state engineer. It is not the invocation of a statute that confers the right of the state engineer to review an application, but that the statute creates a procedure by which proposed actions are reviewed in specific ways and for specific purposes. Applicants have the burden to fulfill the statutory requirements for completing an adequate application and notice of intent to divert, but are not required to invoke a specific statute.Carangelo v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth., 2014-NMCA-032, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-002.\n\nWhere applicant applied for a permit to divert native Rio Grande water, to which applicant had no appropriative right, to enable applicant to carry its San Juan-Chama water into the applicant's water treatment plant for processing and distribution through applicant's drinking water project; the application stated that the native Rio Grande water would not be consumptively used, because the water would be returned to the river in full measure and did not seek any appropriative rights to the native Rio Grande water; the Middle Rio Grande Basin was fully appropriated, the state engineer had jurisdiction to determine whether the application fell within the state engineer's statutory authority.Carangelo v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth., 2014-NMCA-032, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-002.\n\nBeneficial uses of water can be non-consumptive.— A beneficial use of water does not require its consumption. Both consumptive and non-consumptive uses of water can be beneficial uses. A non-consumptive, beneficial use can be the basis for an appropriation of water as much as a consumptive use.Carangelo v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth., 2014-NMCA-032, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-002.\n\nNon-consumptive use of water was a new beneficial use that required an appropriation.— Where applicant applied for a permit to divert native Rio Grande water, to which applicant had no appropriative right, to enable applicant to carry its San Juan-Chama water into the applicant's water treatment plant for processing and distribution through applicant's drinking water project; the application did not request an appropriation of the native Rio Grande water or a request to divert the water for a beneficial use; applicant claimed that it would not apply the water to beneficial use and that the water would not be consumptively used because it would be returned to the river in full measure; and the Middle Rio Grande Basin was fully appropriated, applicant's diversion of native Rio Grande water was for a beneficial use, which required an appropriation of the water to enable applicant to put the water to the beneficial use.Carangelo v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth., 2014-NMCA-032, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-002.\n\nSection 72-5-1 NMSA 1978 sets forth the state engineer's authority, it does not restrict that authority.Carangelo v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth., 2014-NMCA-032, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-002.\n\nA non-consumptive beneficial use of water in a fully appropriated basin.— The state engineer has the authority to determine whether a new non-consumptive use would or would not have any impact on the available water in a fully appropriated basin and whether it could be allowed under Section 72-5-7 NMSA 1978. A non-consumptive beneficial use piggy-backed onto a fully appropriated basin can, under certain appropriate circumstances, be a legitimate appropriation.Carangelo v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth., 2014-NMCA-032, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-002.\n\nStream and underground water rights identical.— Although appropriators' rights regarding streams and underground waters may be secured under different administrative procedures, substantive rights obtained are identical; likewise, jurisdiction and duties of state engineer relating to streams and underground waters are the same.City of Albuquerque v. Reynolds, 1962-NMSC-173, 71 N.M. 428, 379 P.2d 73.\n\nException to permit requirement.— The provisions of Section 72-5-32 NMSA 1978 expressly enumerating the dams and resulting ponds which require permits exempt those dams not mentioned from the general permit requirement.State ex rel. State Eng'r v. Lewis, 1996-NMCA-019, 121 N.M. 323, 910 P.2d 957, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 242, 910 P.2d 318.\n\nPermit requirements applicable to United States.— Unless state requirements regarding distribution of water are inconsistent with applicable federal law, the United States is subject to those requirements such that it would have to apply for a permit under this section.Jicarilla Apache Tribe v. U.S., 657 F.2d 1126 (10th Cir. 1981).\n\nTort liability.— Defendant, who built a dam without obtaining the permit required hereunder, and negligently maintained same, was liable for damage caused by such negligence, despite fact that negligence of one of plaintiffs was also a proximate cause of the damage.Little v. Price, 1964-NMSC-178, 74 N.M. 626, 397 P.2d 15.\n\nReasonable charge dependent on costs.— What is reasonable charge for water in any case must depend largely on cost of constructing and operating the irrigating works.Young v. Hinderlider, 1910-NMSC-061, 15 N.M. 666, 110 P. 1045.\n\nCommunity acequias.— This act (Laws 1907, ch. 49) does not regulate community acequias constructed prior to passage thereof as to right to change point of diversion from stream into such acequias, but under it, condemnation proceedings to enlarge old community acequia are authorized.Pueblo of Isleta v. Tondre, 1913-NMSC-067, 18 N.M. 388, 137 P. 86.\n\nEffect of application.— Mere application for permit to appropriate waters establishes no right to the use thereof.Carlsbad Irrigation Dist. v. Ford, 1942-NMSC-042, 46 N.M. 335, 128 P.2d 1047.\n\nWater belongs to state.— All water within the state, whether above or beneath the surface of the ground, belongs to the state, which authorizes its use; there is no ownership in the corpus of the water, but the use thereof may be acquired, and the basis of such acquisition is beneficial use.State ex rel. Erickson v. McLean, 1957-NMSC-012, 62 N.M. 264, 308 P.2d 983.\n\nState engineer has power to make rules and regulationswhich may affect bureau of reclamation when it has reserved unappropriated waters, and state engineer may require it to file proofs of completion of works and meet any other reasonable requirements provided by rule and regulation. 1952 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 52-5559.\n\nAppropriation procedure unlawful.— The state engineer's water rights dedication practice and procedure imposing a condition on the groundwater permit requiring that at some future time the applicant acquire and retire a specified amount of surface water rights in the related stream system is unlawful because it precludes full consideration of public welfare and water conservation resulting in an impairment of existing water rights at the time the new conditional water right is approved, since the rights are not identified until the permit is issued, preventing public notice and comment. 1994 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 94-07.\n\nExtension rejected.— Extension of time for filing application for water is properly rejected if no proper showing has been made of ability to proceed with the work. 1914 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 14-1362.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Changing Interpretations of New Mexico's Constitutional Provisions Allocating Water Resources: Integrating Private Property and Public Values,\" see 26 N.M.

The notice shall give all essential facts as to the proposed appropriation; among them, the places of appropriation and of use, amount of water, the purpose for which it is to be used, name and address of applicant and the time when the application shall be taken up by the state engineer for consideration.\n\nHistory:Laws 1907, ch. 49, § 26; Code 1915, § 5681; C.S. 1929, § 151-132; Laws 1941, ch. 126, § 8; 1941 Comp., § 77-504; 1953 Comp., § 75-5-4; 2001, ch. 26, § 1; 2019, ch. 88, § 2.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The 1915 Code compilers substituted \"this article\" for \"this act,\" presumably thereby extending the reference to include all the provisions of Code 1915, ch. 114, art.

Lomos Altos, Inc., 2007-NMSC-002, 141 N.M. 21, 150 P.3d 971.\n\nIn a fully-appropriated basin, new depletions do not automatically constitute impairment as a matter of law.Montgomery v.

Lomos Altos, Inc., 2007-NMSC-002, 141 N.M. 21, 150 P.3d 971.\n\nTempelton doctrine source requirementsdo not apply to statutory transfers. Templeton supplementary wells service the original parcel, while statutory transfers may apply to new uses for the water over significant distances. A Templeton supplemental well need not, in all cases, be positioned upstream of a surface point of diversion.Herrington v. State of N.M. ex rel.

Texaco, Inc., 1966-NMSC-226, 77 N.M. 239, 421 P.2d 771.\n\nConsiderations in transfer applications.— General public interest is not a proper consideration in transfer applications. Once there has been proper application to the state engineer, detriment to existing water rights is the only basis on which an application can lawfully be denied.Ensenada Land & Water Ass'n v. Sleeper, 1988-NMCA-030, 107 N.M. 494, 760 P.2d 787, cert. quashed, 107 N.M. 413, 759 P.2d 200.\n\nSeverance.— Section 72-5-23 NMSA 1978 requires consent of landowner and approval of state engineer to sever water rights.Turner v. Bassett, 2005-NMSC-009, 137 N.M. 381, 111 P.3d 701.\n\nFindings required for transfer.— A transfer of water rights only requires the state engineer to make a finding of the three factors in this section.Montgomery v.

      "text": "An appropriator of water may, with the approval of the state engineer, use the same for other than the purpose for which it was appropriated or may change the place of diversion, storage or use in the manner and under the conditions prescribed in Sections 72-5-3 and 72-5-23 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:Laws 1907, ch. 49, § 45; Code 1915, § 5704; C.S. 1929, § 151-157; Laws 1941, ch. 126, § 18; 1941 Comp., § 77-523; 1953 Comp., § 75-5-23; Laws 1985, ch. 201, § 6.\n\nCross references.— For changing point of diversion of community ditches,see73-2-63 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor state engineer,see72-2-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1985 amendmentsubstituted \"Sections 72-5-3 and 72-5-23 NMSA 1978\" for \"Sections 151-131 and 151-156 as amended herein provided that no such change shall be allowed to the detriment of the rights of others having valid and existing rights to the use of the waters of said stream system\" at the end of the section.\n\nSubject matter jurisdiction.— The state engineer has subject matter jurisdiction to review an application irrespective of the applicant making specific reference to, or invocation of, any statutory section in the application, so long as the application seeks permission to do something within the statutory and regulatory authority of the state engineer. It is not the invocation of a statute that confers the right of the state engineer to review an application, but that the statute creates a procedure by which proposed actions are reviewed in specific ways and for specific purposes. Applicants have the burden to fulfill the statutory requirements for completing an adequate application and notice of intent to divert, but are not required to invoke a specific statute.Carangelo v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth., 2014-NMCA-032, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-002.\n\nWhere applicant applied for a permit to divert native Rio Grande water, to which applicant had no appropriative right, to enable applicant to carry its San Juan-Chama water into the applicant's water treatment plant for processing and distribution through applicant's drinking water project; the application stated that the native Rio Grande water would not be consumptively used, because the water would be returned to the river in full measure and did not seek any appropriative rights to the native Rio Grande water; the Middle Rio Grande Basin was fully appropriated, the state engineer had jurisdiction to determine whether the application fell within the State Engineer's statutory authority.Carangelo v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth., 2014-NMCA-032, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-002.\n\nSection 72-5-24 NMSA 1978 sets forth the state engineer's authority, it does not restrict that authority.Carangelo v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth., 2014-NMCA-032, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-002.\n\nTempleton doctrine source requirementsdo not apply to statutory transfers. Templeton supplementary wells service the original parcel, while statutory transfers may apply to new uses for the water over significant distances. A Templeton supplemental well need not, in all cases, be positioned upstream of a surface point of diversion.Herrington v. State of N.M. ex rel. Office of the State Eng'r, 2006-NMSC-014, 139 N.M. 368, 133 P.3d 258.\n\nEffect of statutes.— Statutes governing change in point of diversion or change in well location do not grant but rather restrict right of appropriator to change point of diversion or well location.Public Serv. Co. v. Reynolds, 1960-NMSC-137, 68 N.M. 54, 358 P.2d 621.\n\nSection does not purport to modifyterms of Section 72-5-3 NMSA 1978.Pueblo of Isleta v. Tondre, 1913-NMSC-067, 18 N.M. 388, 137 P. 86.\n\nFederal reclamation projects exempt from requirements of this sectionby the terms of Section 72-9-4 NMSA 1978.City of Raton v. Vermejo Conservancy Dist., 1984-NMSC-037, 101 N.M. 95, 678 P.2d 1170.\n\nRights incident to ownership.— Water right is property right and inherent therein is right to change place of diversion, storage or use of water if rights or other water users will not be injured thereby.Clodfelter v. Reynolds, 1961-NMSC-003, 68 N.M. 61, 358 P.2d 626.\n\nWater right severable and transferable.— This section and Section 72-5-23 NMSA 1978 expressly recognize that right to use water upon certain lands may be severed from such lands and become appurtenant to other lands, or may be transferred for other purposes and other uses.Mathers v. Texaco, Inc., 1966-NMSC-226, 77 N.M. 239, 421 P.2d 771.\n\nSurface water reaching underground reservoir.— Section only authorizes change of place of diversion, storage or use; there is nothing in language hereof indicating intention of legislature to permit diversion under surface water right of water which has reached underground reservoir and lost identity as surface water.Kelley v. Carlsbad Irrigation Dist., 1966-NMSC-121, 76 N.M. 466, 415 P.2d 849.\n\nThe transfer of surface right to water which has lost its identity as surface water on reaching underground reservoir, would not be change in point of diversion, but would constitute new appropriation in underground reservoir.Kelley v. Carlsbad Irrigation Dist., 1966-NMSC-121, 76 N.M. 466, 415 P.2d 849.\n\nChange of diversion and storage locations.— Since water statutes of Colorado and New Mexico have no extraterritorial effect, water company had right to change places of diversion and storage of water rights adjudicated to certain reservoirs from points in Colorado to points in New Mexico, provided such changes could be effected without injuriously affecting rights of other water users, and it was not necessary for it to obtain approval of such changes by New Mexico state engineer or Colorado court which entered decree of adjudication.Lindsey v. McClure, 136 F.2d 65 (10th Cir. 1943).\n\nMiddle Rio Grande Administrative Area.— Where the guidelines administering groundwater applications within the Middle Rio Grande Administrative Area require a transfer to sufficient surface water rights prior to granting a permit for new groundwater use, because of this requirement, the state engineer handles applications for a new use of groundwater within the MRGAA as an application to change the point of diversion and purpose of use of the existing water rights.Montgomery v. N.M. State Eng'r, 2005-NMCA-071, 137 N.M. 659, 114 P.3d 339,aff'd in part,Montgomery v. Lomos Altos, Inc., 2007-NMSC-002, 141 N.M. 21, 150 P.3d 971.\n\nChange in vehicle of transport of water.— Even if the lateral diversionary ditch did not exist when the state engineer issued the license to the downstream user's predecessor for use of water through the existing irrigation ditch, a change in the vehicle of transport of water for a particular use does not constitute a change in the use of water requiring state-approval within the meaning of this section, at least in the absence of a provision in a decree or license mandating a specific means of transport. Thus, use of the lateral ditch did not change the water use.Deaf Smith Cnty. Grain Processors, Inc. v. Dixon, 1993-NMCA-130, 116 N.M. 523, 864 P.2d 812.\n\nAdjudication of water rights.— In determination of petition to change purpose and point of diversion of certain adjudicated water rights, state engineer was required to accept court's decree as to nature and extent of rights sought to be transferred.W.S. Ranch Co. v. Kaiser Steel Corp., 1968-NMSC-041, 79 N.M. 65, 439 P.2d 714.\n\nWhere water rights had been adjudicated by prior decree, purchaser of certain water rights who petitioned state engineer to change point of diversion was only entitled to amount of water that was available at former point of diversion.W.S. Ranch Co. v. Kaiser Steel Corp., 1968-NMSC-041, 79 N.M. 65, 439 P.2d 714.\n\nNo authority in state engineer to adjudicate.— In holding that total amount of water appropriated in any year under all public service company's claims of right should not exceed 5040 acre-feet, state engineer in effect adjudicated or attempted to adjudicate company's claimed water rights, and this the state engineer had no authority to do.Public Serv. Co. v. Reynolds, 1960-NMSC-137, 68 N.M. 54, 358 P.2d 621.\n\nInjunction against enforcement of order.— Owner of water rights in interstate stream was entitled to injuction against enforcement of state engineer's order, made without notice and hearing, which forbade use of excess storage space of New Mexico reservoir, constructed primarily for storing unappropriated water to irrigate New Mexico land, for initial stor age of water attributable to Colorado reservoirs with prior water rights, and to use New Mexico ditch to carry water to Colorado reservoirs, where such use would not affect other water users adversely.Lindsey v. McClure, 136 F.2d 65 (10th Cir. 1943).\n\nLaw reviews.— For student article, \"Herrington v.

When the party entitled to the use of water fails to beneficially use all or any part of the water claimed by him, for which a right of use has vested for the purpose for which it was appropriated or adjudicated, except the waters for storage reservoirs, for a period of four years, such unused water shall, if the failure to beneficially use the water persists one year after notice and declaration of nonuser given by the state engineer, revert to the public and shall be regarded as unappropriated public water; provided, however, that forfeiture shall not necessarily occur if circumstances beyond the control of the owner have caused nonuse, such that the water could not be placed to beneficial use by diligent efforts of the owner; and provided that periods of nonuse when irrigated farm lands are placed under the acreage reserve program or conservation reserve program provided by the federal Food Security Act of 1985, P.L. 99-198, shall not be computed as part of the four-year forfeiture period; and provided, further, that the condition of notice and declaration of nonuser shall not apply to water that has reverted to the public by operation of law prior to June 1, 1965.\n\nB. Upon application to the state engineer at any time and a proper showing of reasonable cause for delay or for nonuse or upon the state engineer finding that it is in the public interest, the state engineer may grant extensions of time, for a period not to exceed three years for each extension, in which to apply to beneficial use the water for which a permit to appropriate has been issued or a water right has vested, was appropriated or has been adjudicated.\n\nC. Periods of nonuse when water rights are acquired by incorporated municipalities or counties for implementation of their water development plans or for preservation of municipal or county water supplies shall not be computed as part of the four-year forfeiture statute.\n\nD. A lawful exemption from the requirements of beneficial use, either by an extension of time or other statutory exemption, stops the running of the four-year period for the period of the exemption, and the period of exemption shall not be included in computing the four-year period.\n\nE. Periods of nonuse when the nonuser of acquired water rights is on active duty as a member of the armed forces of this country shall not be included in computing the four-year period.\n\nF. The owner or holder of a valid water right or permit to appropriate waters for agricultural purposes appurtenant to designated or specified lands may apply the full amount of water covered by or included in the water right or permit to any part of the designated or specified tract without penalty or forfeiture.\n\nG. Periods of nonuse when water rights are acquired and placed in a state engineer-approved water conservation program, by an individual or entity that owns water rights, a conservancy district organized pursuant to Chapter 73, Articles 14 through 19 NMSA 1978, a soil and water conservation district organized pursuant to Chapter 73, Article 20 NMSA 1978, an acequia or community ditch association organized pursuant to Chapter 73, Article 2 or 3 NMSA 1978, an irrigation district organized pursuant to Chapter 73, Articles 9 through 13 NMSA 1978 or the interstate stream commission shall not be computed as part of the four-year forfeiture period.\n\nH.

Office of the State Engineer v. Elephant Butte Irrigation Dist., 2012-NMCA-090, 287 P.3d 324, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-008.\n\nWhere landowners were the owners of land that had been acquired in1881 by United States patents; the landowners claimed that the land had been irrigated prior to 1881 and that the date of appropriation was at least 1881; and although portions of the property had been farmed and irrigated prior to 1956, after 1956 the land was not farmed and water has not otherwise been put to beneficial use on any of the land, the landowner's water rights were subject to forfeiture and common law abandonment.State ex rel. Office of the State Engineer v. Elephant Butte Irrigation Dist., 2012-NMCA-090, 287 P.3d 324, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-008.\n\nAbandonment.— To prove abandonment, a party must show that the owner relinquished the water rights with the intention to forsake such rights.State ex rel. Martinez v. McDermett, 1995-NMCA-060, 120 N.M. 327, 901 P.2d 745.\n\nSection was merely declaratory of lawas it had already been established by judicial decisions, the time for the application to be a reasonable time.Hagerman Irrigation Co. v. McMurry, 1911-NMSC-021, 16 N.M. 172, 113 P. 823.\n\nSection is forfeiture statute for nonuse of water rightsunder certain circumstances.Jones v. Anderson, 1970-NMSC-044, 81 N.M. 423, 467 P.2d 995.\n\nContinual use as basis of title to water rights.— Continuance of title to water right is based upon continuing beneficial use, and where right is not exercised for four years, statute declares that right to unused portion is forfeited.State ex rel. Reynolds v. South Springs Co., 1969-NMSC-023, 80 N.M. 144, 452 P.2d 478.\n\nNonuse for four years constitutes abandonment.Yeo v. Tweedy, 1929-NMSC-033, 34 N.M. 611, 286 P. 970.\n\nIntention not required.— Element of intention is required in doctrine of abandonment; this is not so in forfeiture.State ex rel. Reynolds v. S. Springs Co., 1969-NMSC-023, 80 N.M. 144, 452 P.2d 478.\n\nUnused water reverts to public.— The failure to use water right for unreasonable time is evidence of intention to abandon it; if nothing is done to utilize water rights within four year period of limitations, such unused water is reverted to the public and shall be regarded as unappropriated public water.State ex rel. Reynolds v. S. Springs Co., 1969-NMSC-023, 80 N.M. 144, 452 P.2d 478.\n\nPueblo rights doctrine is incompatiblewith New Mexico water law.State ex rel. Martinez v. City of Las Vegas, 2004-NMSC-009, 135 N.M. 375, 89 P.3d 47.\n\nPueblo rights doctrine interfereswith the necessity of utilizing water for the maximum benefits.State ex rel. Martinez v. City of Las Vegas, 2004-NMSC-009, 135 N.M. 375, 89 P.3d 47.\n\n\"Reasonable time\".— A municipality may be given a more substantial \"reasonable time\" for its population growth than a typical water user would have to complete an appropriation.State ex rel. Martinez v. City of Las Vegas, 2004-NMSC-009, 135 N.M. 375, 89 P.3d 47.\n\nReasonable time for development of water use relates backto the date of showing an intent to appropriate by acquiring a permit.Jicarilla Apache Tribe v. United States, 657 F.2d 1126 (10th Cir. 1981).\n\nNonuser resulting from drought.— When suit was brought to enjoin another from using water from river through certain ditch because of nonuser, evidence that nonuser resulted from droughts sufficiently established that forfeiture should not be decreed.Chavez v. Gutierrez, 1950-NMSC-004, 54 N.M. 76, 213 P.2d 597.\n\nSince there was no showing of abandonment or forfeiture, nor was any particular reason given why existing water right should have been considered to be impaired, and year or years in question were particularly dry ones, and there was no water available, owner of water right would not be penalized.W.S. Ranch Co. v. Kaiser Steel Corp., 1968-NMSC-041, 79 N.M. 65, 439 P.2d 714.\n\nFailure to reach diversion point.— When water fails to reach point of diversion without fault of appropriator, and he is at all times ready and willing to put water to usual beneficial use, there is no forfeiture of his right for nonuser.N.M. Prods. Co. v. N.M. Power Co., 1937-NMSC-048, 42 N.M. 311, 77 P.2d 634.\n\nFederal water right.— Abandonment and waste by federal park service of right to use water from certain spring, which right was purchased by United States in 1934, is controlled by congress as this right is property of the United States, and property of the United States may not be lost through laches or neglect of its officers and employees.United States v. Ballard, 184 F. Supp. 1 (D.N.M. 1960).\n\nInjunction not appropriate.— Waste, nonuser and abandonment were not bars to United States' cause of action against individual landowners seeking injunction enjoining them from using wells so as to deprive United States of flow of certain spring, but should be considered with granting of equitable relief; since there was no threat of loss of available water to any party at present or in foreseeable future, there was not sufficient showing of great and irreparable damage so as to justify injunctive relief.United States v. Ballard, 184 F. Supp. 1 (D.N.M. 1960).\n\nEngineer's authority.— Since an engineer has no authority to cancel alleged water rights, he has no authority to compel respondent to restore undescribed entries in records canceled by his predecessor.Turley v. State Eng'r, 1935-NMSC-075, 39 N.M. 472, 49 P.2d 1135.\n\nWater rights of owner in community ditch are subject to forfeitureprovisions of this section; failure to use water because of failure to pay assessment would not constitute circumstances beyond control of water right owner. 1967 Op.

An application to appropriate those flood waters is required and an appropriation of those flood waters is appropriate only if that appropriation would not interfere with prior appropriations. Section 72-5-29 NMSA 1978 did not create a super status water use that supersedes the normal appropriation process.Waterfall Cmty. Water Users Ass'n v. N.M.
