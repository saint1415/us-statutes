      "heading": "Underground waters declared to be public; applications for livestock watering, domestic and temporary uses of water",
      "text": "The water of underground streams, channels, artesian basins, reservoirs or lakes, having reasonably ascertainable boundaries, is declared to belong to the public and is subject to appropriation for beneficial use. By reason of the varying amounts and time such water is used and the relatively small amounts of water consumed in the watering of livestock; in irrigation of not to exceed one acre of noncommercial trees, lawn or garden; in household or other domestic use; and in prospecting, mining or construction of public works, highways and roads or drilling operations designed to discover or develop the natural resources of the state, application for any such use shall be governed by the provisions of Sections 72-12-1.1 through 72-12-1.3 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:Laws 1931, ch. 131, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 77-1101; 1953, ch. 61, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 75-11-1; Laws 1959, ch. 193, § 1; 1998, ch. 50, § 1; 2001, ch. 207, § 2; 2003, ch. 298, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The references to \"this act\" properly refer to Laws 1953, ch. 61, compiled as this section, which added all of the section following the first sentence. It is probable, however, that reference to Laws 1931, ch. 131 the provisions of which are presently compiled as 72-12-1 to 72-12-10 NMSA 1978, was intended.\n\nCross references.— For definition of \"acre-foot,\"see72-5-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor appeal de novo from decision, act or refusal to act of state executive officer or body in matters relating to water rights,seeN.M. Const., art. XVI, § 5.\n\nFor the state engineer,see72-2-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, substituted \"livestock watering, domestic and temporary uses of water\" for \"use to state engineer; hearings\" in the section heading and rewrote the section substituting the statutory references at the end of the section for former Subsections A and B.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, inserted \"provided that permits for domestic water use within municipalities shall be conditioned to require the permittee to comply with all applicable municipal ordinances enacted pursuant to Chapter 3, Article 53 NMSA 1978; and\" in Subsection A.\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective May 20, 1998, rewrote the section to the extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nMunicipality may prohibit domestic wells.— The city has the authority to prohibit the drilling of domestic wells under its home rule authority. This authority is not preempted by existing state law.Smith v. City of Santa Fe, 2006-NMCA-048, 139 N.M. 410, 133 P.3d 866,aff'd, 2007-NMSC-055, 142 N.M. 786, 171 P.3d 300.\n\nSection is not void for vaguenessand uncertainty.State ex rel. Bliss v. Dority, 1950-NMSC-066, 55 N.M. 12, 225 P.2d 1007,appeal dismissed, 341 U.S. 924, 71 S. Ct. 798, 95 L. Ed. 1356 (1951).\n\nAct is merely declaratory of law already existing,in its classification of underground streams, artesian basins and reservoirs with reasonably certain boundaries as public and subject to appropriation.Pecos Valley Artesian Conservancy Dist. v. Peters, 1945-NMSC-029, 50 N.M. 165, 173 P.2d 490,appeal after remand, 1948-NMSC-022, 52 N.M. 148, 193 P.2d 418.\n\nLaws 1927, ch. 182, § 1 (now repealed), declaring underground waters, boundaries of which may be reasonably ascertained, to belong to the public, and to be subject to appropriation for beneficial use, was not subversive of vested rights of owners of lands overlying such waters, since it was declaratory of existing law.Yeo v. Tweedy, 1929-NMSC-033, 34 N.M. 611, 286 P. 970.\n\nStream and underground water rights identical.— Although appropriators' rights regarding streams and underground waters may be secured under different administrative procedures, substantive rights obtained are identical; likewise, jurisdiction and duties of state engineer relating to streams and underground waters are the same.City of Albuquerque v. Reynolds, 1962-NMSC-173, 71 N.M. 428, 379 P.2d 73.\n\nAll water owned by state.— All water within state, whether above or beneath surface, belongs to state, which authorizes its use; there is no ownership in corpus of water, but use thereof may be acquired, basis of such acquisition being beneficial use.State ex rel. Erickson v. McLean, 1957-NMSC-012, 62 N.M. 264, 308 P.2d 983.\n\nWaters reaching underground basin public.— When artificial or natural flow of surface water, through percolation, seepage or otherwise, reaches underground reservoir and thereby loses its identity as surface water, such waters become public under provisions of this section and are subject to appropriation in accordance with applicable statutes.Kelley v. Carlsbad Irrigation Dist., 1966-NMSC-121, 76 N.M. 466, 415 P.2d 849.\n\nThere is no law permitting storing of private waters in established underground water basins; when waters, either artificial surface waters or natural surface waters, reach established underground water basin by percolation, seepage or otherwise, they become public waters.State ex rel. Reynolds v. King, 1958-NMSC-016, 63 N.M. 425, 321 P.2d 200.\n\nPrior to statutes, well-defined and constant stream in subterranean channel was protected to the owner as much as though it ran through natural channel on surface.Keeney v. Carillo, 1883-NMSC-005, 2 N.M. 480.\n\nWaters in underground basin not transferable.— One having water right in surface flow, which has been lost to underground reservoir, can neither transfer his surface right nor change his point of diversion to underground reservoir.Kelley v. Carlsbad Irrigation Dist., 1966-NMSC-121, 76 N.M. 466, 415 P.2d 849.\n\nTotal ban on interstate transportation of ground water cannot be supported.— Taken as a whole, New Mexico's scheme of water regulation demonstrates a genuine effort to promote optimum utilization of its diminishing water resources. This effort, which is unquestionably legitimate and highly important, may justify limited, nondiscriminatory burdens on interstate commerce, but cannot support a total ban on the interstate transportation of ground water.City of El Paso ex rel. Pub. Serv. Bd. v. Reynolds, 563 F. Supp. 379 (D.N.M. 1983).\n\nBeneficial uses may include recreation, fish and wildlife purposes.— The holding of Jicarilla Apache Tribe v. U.S., 657 F.2d 1126 (10th Cir. 1981), does not broadly stand for the proposition that using San Juan Chama Project water for recreation, fish and wildlife purposes is not \"beneficial\" under federal and state law.Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. Keys, 333 F.3d 1109 (10th Cir. 2003).\n\nProtection of endangered species is a beneficial use.— Diverting San Juan Chama Project water to prevent jeopardy to an endangered species of minnow is a \"beneficial\" use under New Mexico law.Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. Keys, 333 F.3d 1109 (10th Cir. 2003).\n\nValley fill as reservoir.— Valley fill from which billions of gallons of water are pumped annually for irrigation is container of water which was aptly called reservoir or lake by legislature.State ex rel. Bliss v. Dority, 1950-NMSC-066, 55 N.M. 12, 225 P.2d 1007,appeal dismissed, 341 U.S. 924, 71 S. Ct. 798, 95 L. Ed. 1356 (1951).\n\nNonrechargeable basins.— New Mexico's water laws, although primarily designed for application to waters whose supply is constantly being renewed, is applicable to nonrechargeable basins, such as the Lea county underground water basin.Mathers v. Texaco, Inc., 1966-NMSC-226, 77 N.M. 239, 421 P.2d 771.\n\nIt would be impossible for state engineer to perform duties imposed upon him by law, without attempting to determine and fix a time estimated as economic life of nonrechargeable basin, and fact that determined and fixed time is less than perpetuity, did not take away powers imposed upon state engineer by law to supervise the basin.Mathers v. Texaco, Inc., 1966-NMSC-226, 77 N.M. 239, 421 P.2d 771.\n\n\"Reasonably\".— Qualifying word \"reasonably\" is used in this section in the sense of \"sufficiently.\"State ex rel. Bliss v. Dority, 1950-NMSC-066, 55 N.M. 12, 225 P.2d 1007,appeal dismissed, 341 U.S. 924, 71 S. Ct. 798, 95 L. Ed. 1356 (1951).\n\nAscertainable boundaries prerequisite to jurisdiction.— Before jurisdiction of state engineer attaches he must make a finding that basin in question has reasonable ascertainable boundaries; absent such finding waters would not be under control or supervision of state engineer.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Mendenhall, 1961-NMSC-083, 68 N.M. 467, 362 P.2d 998.\n\nPrior appropriation doctrine applies to waters in artesian basins.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Mendenhall, 1961-NMSC-083, 68 N.M. 467, 362 P.2d 998.\n\nPriority in underground water right.— Landowner who lawfully began developing underground water right and completed it with reasonable diligence acquired a water right with priority date as the initiation of his work even though the lands involved were placed within declared artesian basin before work was finished and water put to beneficial use.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Mendenhall, 1961-NMSC-083, 68 N.M. 467, 362 P.2d 998.\n\nRelation back of rights.— Rights of appropriator of water do not become absolute until appropriation is completed by actual application of water to use designed; but where he has pursued appropriation with due diligence, and brought it to completion within reasonable time, as against other appropriators, his rights will relate back to time of commencement of work.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Mendenhall, 1961-NMSC-083, 68 N.M. 467, 362 P.2d 998.\n\nWater rights of patent holder.— Since lands were patented after date of Desert Land Act (43 U.S.C. § 321, et seq.), but waters were reserved in or before date of said act to state of New Mexico as trustee for the public, and subject to its use by the public at any time thereafter, patents to such land carried no right to use of water, except as to that actually applied to reclaiming land under the Desert Land Act, and not thereafter abandoned.State ex rel. Bliss v. Dority, 1950-NMSC-066, 55 N.M. 12, 225 P.2d 1007, appeal dismissed, 341 U.S. 924, 71 S. Ct. 798, 95 L. Ed. 1356 (1951).\n\nWater right affirmed.— Since defendant produced witnesses who farmed tract in question, as well as neighbors who saw the land being worked and certain crops growing thereon, aerial photograph showed ditches from which tract could have been irrigated, and tract was in a depression or old lake bed so that at least before completion of certain leveling and grading work, water ran on it from surrounding land, trial court's finding that tract had valid water right would be affirmed.State ex rel. Bliss v. Potter Co., 1957-NMSC-066, 63 N.M. 101, 314 P.2d 390.\n\nFinding of water right erroneous.— Trial court erred in finding that certain tract had a valid water right, where two hydrographic surveys and one aerial photographic survey, made in different years, showed the tract to be unirrigated salt grass land, and evidence showed that former owners had acquiesced in restricted permit and license for a new well.State ex rel. Bliss v. Potter Co., 1957-NMSC-066, 63 N.M. 101, 314 P.2d 390.\n\nEngineer's jurisdiction statutory.— State engineer's jurisdiction over waters of underground streams, channels, artesian basins, reservoirs and lakes is statutory and no provision in law requires adjudication in court to define or determine area of any of described waters.State ex rel. Bliss v. Dority, 1950-NMSC-066, 55 N.M. 12, 225 P.2d 1007,appeal dismissed, 341 U.S. 924, 71 S. Ct. 798, 95 L. Ed. 1356 (1951).\n\nState engineer exercises administrative control over particular groundwater basinby declaring it and defining its boundaries.Hanson v. Turney, 2004-NMCA-069, 136 N.M. 1, 94 P.3d 1.\n\nStatutory procedure exclusive.— Waters in controversy being public waters, statutory manner of acquiring rights thereto is exclusive.State ex rel. Reynolds v. King, 1958-NMSC-016, 63 N.M. 425, 321 P.2d 200.\n\nIllegal use of public waters does not create any rightto continued use since statutory manner for securing right to use public waters is exclusive.State ex rel. Bliss v. Dority, 1950-NMSC-066, 55 N.M. 12, 225 P.2d 1007, appeal dismissed, 341 U.S. 924, 71 S. Ct. 798, 95 L. Ed. 1356 (1951).\n\nBurden on applicant to show nonimpairment.— Under statute regulating appropriation of water of underground basin reservoirs, burden is on the applicant to show that there will be no impairment of existing rights.Mathers v. Texaco, Inc., 1966-NMSC-226, 77 N.M. 239, 421 P.2d 771.\n\nImpairment dependent on facts.— The question of \"impairment of existing rights\" under statute regulating appropriation of water of underground basin reservoirs is one which must generally be decided upon the facts in each case.Mathers v. Texaco, Inc., 1966-NMSC-226, 77 N.M. 239, 421 P.2d 771.\n\nAmount of impairment not at issue.— State engineer, having performed his positive duty of determining whether or not existing rights would be impaired, did not have duty to further determine degree or amount of impairment.Mathers v. Texaco, Inc., 1966-NMSC-226, 77 N.M. 239, 421 P.2d 771.\n\nReturn of water negatives impairment of rights.— Appropriation application would be granted where applicant proposed to return amount of drainage water equal to that appropriated to underground basin, as prior rights would not be impaired thereby nor would basin waters be depleted.Reynolds v. Wiggins, 1964-NMSC-252, 74 N.M. 670, 397 P.2d 469.\n\nConditional approval.— In order to prevent an impairment of rights, state engineer has authority to approve an application subject to conditions.City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179.\n\nState engineer was not attempting to exercise jurisdiction over Rio Grande stream water in requiring applicant city to retire surface rights so as to protect prior stream appropriators as condition of granting applications to appropriate underground water from Rio Grande basin, but was merely exercising duties under Sections 72-2-1 and 72-12-3 NMSA 1978.City of Albuquerque v. Reynolds, 1962-NMSC-173, 71 N.M. 428, 379 P.2d 73.\n\nRight to seek injunction.— Even though well was lawfully drilled without permit outside of artesian conservancy district, district could maintain suit to enjoin use of water from such well which was located on land outside territorially defined boundaries of the basin as well as outside district boundaries.Pecos Valley Artesian Conservancy Dist. v. Peters, 1945-NMSC-029, 50 N.M. 165, 173 P.2d 490,appeal after remand, 1948-NMSC-022, 52 N.M. 148, 193 P.2d 418.\n\nThough an artesian conservancy district owned no land serviced by waters of an artesian basin and no water rights, it constituted proper party plaintiff for maintaining suit to enjoin use of water from unlawfully drilled well.Pecos Valley Artesian Conservancy Dist. v. Peters, 1945-NMSC-029, 50 N.M. 165, 173 P.2d 490,appeal after remand, 1948-NMSC-022, 52 N.M. 148, 193 P.2d 418.\n\nBurden to establish amount of appropriated water.— Burden was on conservancy district seeking injunction to establish amount of water which owners of wells existing at time defendant's well tapped basin were legally entitled to use and if that had been done defendant would have been burdened with proving that there was unappropriated water to which he was entitled; however, as the district failed to make out a prima facie case, trial court did not err in dismissing the bill.Pecos Valley Artesian Conservancy Dist. v. Peters, 1948-NMSC-022, 52 N.M. 148, 193 P.2d 418.\n\nAppealability.— Letter received from state engineer by applicant for appropriation, which letter declared intention to deny the application, but made reference to later \"final action\" not yet taken, was not an appealable \"decision, act or refusal to act.\"State ex rel. Bliss v. Alexander, 1955-NMSC-061, 59 N.M. 478, 286 P.2d 322.\n\nNo \"water right\" arises from private property pond.— Nowhere in Chapter 72, Article 12, is there any indication that a \"water right\" subject to impairment, and which provides standing to protest another's application for a permit, arises from the mere existence of a pond on private property.Town of Silver City v. Scartaccini, 2006-NMCA-009, 138 N.M. 813, 126 P.3d 1177.\n\nSource of pond water.— Unless shown otherwise by the person claiming some sort of a private right, the source of pond water, if no surface source is shown, is presumed to be underground water that is shared by other members of the public within the hydrologic model boundary.Town of Silver City v. Scartaccini, 2006-NMCA-009, 138 N.M. 813, 126 P.3d 1177.\n\nAppropriation procedure unlawful.— The state engineer's water rights dedication practice and procedure imposing a condition on the groundwater permit requiring that at some future time the applicant acquire and retire a specified amount of surface water rights in the related stream system is unlawful because it precludes full consideration of public welfare and water conservation resulting in an impairment of existing water rights at the time the new conditional water right is approved, since the rights are not identified until the permit is issued, preventing public notice and comment. 1994 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 94-07.\n\n\"Reasonably ascertainable boundaries\".— This law requiring a permit to take water from a stream only applies to water lying within reasonably ascertainable boundaries and reducing stream flow or taking water from it. 1936 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 36-1408.\n\nOnce the state engineer had ascertained that waters mentioned in this section had boundaries which were reasonably ascertainable, he could under rule-making power conferred by former 75-11-11, 1953 Comp., declare them to be public waters so that thereafter they would be within his administrative jurisdiction. 1949 Op.

      "heading": "Underground waters; domestic use; permit.",
      "text": "A person, firm or corporation desiring to use public underground waters described in this section for irrigation of not to exceed one acre of noncommercial trees, lawn or garden or for household or other domestic use shall make application to the state engineer for a well on a form to be prescribed by the state engineer. Upon the filing of each application describing the use applied for, the state engineer shall issue a permit to the applicant to use the underground waters applied for; provided that permits for domestic water use within municipalities shall be conditioned to require the permittee to comply with all applicable municipal ordinances enacted pursuant to Chapter 3, Article 53 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 72-12-1.1, enacted by Laws 2003, ch. 298, § 2.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2003, ch. 298 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 23, was effective June 20, 2003, 90 days after adjournment of the legislature.\n\nPermitting.— Section 72-12-1.1 NMSA 1978 is a permitting statute. It does not dictate how a permit will be administered and it does not prevent permits from being administered in the same way as all other water rights, including priority administration.Bounds v. State ex rel. D'Antonio, 2013-NMSC-037,aff'g2011-NMCA-011, 149 N.M. 484, 252 P.3d 708.\n\nSection 72-12-1.1 NMSA 1978 is not facially unconstitutional.— Section 72-12-1.1 NMSA 1978 does not on its face violate the priority doctrine of Article XVI, Section 2 of the New Mexico Constitution or constitute an impermissible exception to that doctrine.Bounds v. State, 2011-NMCA-011, 149 N.M. 484, 252 P.3d 708, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-001, 150 N.M. 558, 263 P.3d 900.\n\nSection 72-12-1.1 NMSA 1978 does not violate the doctrine of prior appropriation set forth in the New Mexico constitution and is facially constitutional.Bounds v. State ex rel. D'Antonio, 2013-NMSC-037,aff'g2011-NMCA-011, 149 N.M. 484, 252 P.3d 708.\n\nWhere plaintiff owned adjudicated surface rights in the Mimbres basin to irrigate plaintiff's farm; the Mimbres basis was a fully appropriated and adjudicated basin and the state engineer had declared the basin closed; plaintiff facially challenged the constitutionality of Section 72-12-1.1 NMSA 1978 on the grounds that the statute authorized the state engineer to issue domestic well permits without determining the availability of unappropriated water, and that the domestic wells authorized by the permits would necessarily impair senior water users; and the state engineer's regulations provided that domestic well permits were subject to priority administration, Section 72-12-1.1 NMSA 1978 was not facially unconstitutional.Bounds v. State ex rel. D'Antonio, 2013-NMSC-037,aff'g2011-NMCA-011, 149 N.M. 484, 252 P.3d 708.\n\nIssuance of domestic well permits did not violate due process.— Where plaintiff owned adjudicated surface rights in the Mimbres basin to irrigate plaintiff's farm; the Mimbres basin was a fully appropriated and adjudicated basin and the state engineer had declared the basin closed; plaintiff claimed that Section 72-12-1.1 NMSA 1978 violated due process because it authorized the state engineer to issue domestic well permits without determining the availability of unappropriated water, and that the domestic wells authorized by the permits would necessarily impair senior water users; the state engineer's regulations provided that domestic well permits were subject to priority administration; and plaintiff failed to show how the issuance of domestic well permits caused or would cause any actual impairment of plaintiff's water rights, Section 72-12-1.1 NMSA 1978 did not facially violate plaintiff's due process rights.Bounds v. State ex rel. D'Antonio, 2013-NMSC-037,aff'g2011-NMCA-011, 149 N.M. 484, 252 P.3d 708.",

Erickson v. McLean, 1957-NMSC-012, 62 N.M. 264, 308 P.2d 983.\n\nEntitlement only to water needed.— No matter how early person's priority of appropriation may be, he is not entitled to receive more water than is necessary for his actual use; excessive diversion of water, through waste, cannot be regarded as diversion to beneficial use, within meaning of N.M. Const., art. XVI, §§ 1 to 3.State ex rel. Erickson v. McLean, 1957-NMSC-012, 62 N.M. 264, 308 P.2d 983.\n\nWaste not countenanced.— Law will not countenance diversion of volume of water from artesian well which, by reason of waste resulting from permitting it to run uncontrolled for 24 hours a day over grazing lands without irrigation system, or through pipes to water troughs fitted with float feeds or other means of control to prevent waste therefrom, is many times that which is actually consumed for useful or beneficial use.State ex rel.

Any person, firm or corporation or any other entity desiring to appropriate for beneficial use any of the waters described in Chapter 72, Article 12 NMSA 1978 shall apply to the state engineer in a form prescribed by the state engineer. In the application, the applicant shall designate:\n\n(1) the particular underground stream, channel, artesian basin, reservoir or lake from which water will be appropriated;\n\n(2) the beneficial use to which the water will be applied;\n\n(3) the location of the proposed well;\n\n(4) the name of the owner of the land on which the well will be located;\n\n(5) the amount of water applied for;\n\n(6) the place of the use for which the water is desired; and\n\n(7) if the use is for irrigation, the description of the land to be irrigated and the name of the owner of the land.\n\nB. If the well will be located on privately owned land and the applicant is not the owner of the land or the owner or the lessee of the mineral or oil and gas rights under the land, the application shall be accompanied by an acknowledged statement executed by the owner of the land that the applicant is granted access across the owner's land to the drilling site and has permission to occupy such portion of the owner's land as is necessary to drill and operate the well. This subsection does not apply to the state or any of its political subdivisions. If the application is approved, the applicant shall have the permit and statement, executed by the owner of the land, recorded in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the land is located.\n\nC. No application shall be accepted by the state engineer unless it is accompanied by all the information required by Subsections A and B of this section.\n\nD. Upon the filing of an application, the state engineer shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 [72-2-20 NMSA1978] of this 2019 act regarding notice of the application. Any person, firm or corporation or other entity objecting that the granting of the application will impair the objector's water right shall have standing to file objections or protests. Any person, firm or corporation or other entity objecting that the granting of the application will be contrary to the conservation of water within the state or detrimental to the public welfare of the state and showing that the objector will be substantially and specifically affected by the granting of the application shall have standing to file objections or protests; provided, however, that the state or any of its branches, agencies, departments, boards, instrumentalities or institutions, and all political subdivisions of the state and their agencies, instrumentalities and institutions shall have standing to file objections or protests.\n\nE. After the expiration of the time for filing objections, if no objections have been filed, the state engineer shall, if the state engineer finds that there are in the underground stream, channel, artesian basin, reservoir or lake unappropriated waters and that the proposed appropriation would not impair existing water rights from the source, is not contrary to conservation of water within the state and is not detrimental to the public welfare of the state, grant the application and issue a permit to the applicant to appropriate all or a part of the waters applied for, subject to the rights of all prior appropriators from the source.\n\nF. If objections or protests have been filed within the time prescribed in the notice or if the state engineer is of the opinion that the permit should not be issued, the state engineer may deny the application without a hearing or, before the state engineer acts on the application, may order that a hearing be held. The state engineer shall notify the applicant of the action by certified mail sent to the address shown in the application.\n\nHistory:Laws 1931, ch. 131, § 3; 1941 Comp., § 77-1103; Laws 1943, ch. 70, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 75-11-3; Laws 1967, ch. 308, § 2; 1971, ch. 134, § 3; 1983, ch. 2, § 2; 1985, ch. 201, § 7; 2001, ch. 26, § 2; 2019, ch. 88, § 6.\n\nCompiler's notes.— For cases dealing with applications for use of underground water,seenotes to 72-12-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nCross references.— For penalty for using or appropriating water without permit required hereunder,see72-12-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor replacement wells,see72-12-22, 72-12-23 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor supplemental wells,see72-12-24 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor applications for the transportation and use of public waters outside the state,see72-12B-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor appeal de novo from decision, act or refusal to act of state executive officer or body in matters relating to water rights,seeN.M. Const., art. XVI, § 5.\n\nFor publication of legal notice,see14-11-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the state engineer,see72-2-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective July 1, 2019, removed certain notice provisions and directed the state engineer to proceed under the new notice provisions of Section 72-2-20 NMSA 1978; and in Subsection D, deleted \"cause to be published in a newspaper that is published and distributed in the county where the well will be located and in each county where the water will be or has been put to beneficial use or where other water rights may be affected or if there is no such newspaper, then in some newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the well will be located at least once a week for three consecutive weeks, a notice that the application has been filed and that objections to the granting of the application may be filed within ten days after the last publication of the notice\" and added \"proceed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this 2019 act regarding notice of the application\".\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, inserted the proviso in Subsection D that requires public notification of a water appropriation in the county of that appropriation.\n\nThe 1985 amendmentinserted \"or any other entity\" preceding \"desiring to appropriate for\" and substituted \"beneficial use\" for \"irrigation or industrial uses\" in the first sentence of the introductory paragraph in Subsection A, inserted \"place of the\" preceding \"use for which\" in Subsection A(6), and added the second, third and fourth sentences in Subsection D.\n\nConstitutionality.— Amendment requiring landowner's permission to use land to operate well was constitutional and valid.City of Hobbs v. State ex rel. Reynolds, 1970-NMSC-133, 82 N.M. 102, 476 P.2d 500.\n\nThe 1967 amendment which permitted removal of proceeding for application for use of underground water from jurisdiction of state engineer and placing of such proceeding within original jurisdiction of the courts (since deleted by 1971 rewriting of this section) was unconstitutional as violative of separation of powers doctrine of N.M. Const., art. III, § 1; it was not validated by subsequent constitutional amendment which neither expressly nor impliedly ratified it, nor was it passed in anticipation of the subsequent constitutional amendment.City of Hobbs v. State ex rel. Reynolds, 1970-NMSC-133, 82 N.M. 102, 476 P.2d 500;Fellows v. Shultz, 1970-NMSC-071, 81 N.M. 496, 469 P.2d 141.\n\nLaws 1927, ch. 182, § 5 (now repealed), providing for administration of act as to any underground waters upon petition signed by ten percent of users of such waters, did not delegate legislative power to petitioners in violation of N.M. Const., art. IV, § 1.Yeo v. Tweedy, 1929-NMSC-033, 34 N.M. 611, 286 P. 970.\n\nInterstate usage of water can be controlled to same extent as intrastate usage.City of El Paso ex rel. Pub. Serv. Bd. v. Reynolds, 563 F. Supp. 379 (D.N.M. 1983).\n\nTotal ban on interstate transportation of ground water cannot be supported.— Taken as a whole, New Mexico's scheme of water regulation demonstrates a genuine effort to promote optimum utilization of its diminishing water resources. This effort, which is unquestionably legitimate and highly important, may justify limited, nondiscriminatory burdens on interstate commerce, but cannot support a total ban on the interstate transportation of ground water.City of El Paso ex rel.

Reynolds, 1962-NMSC-173, 71 N.M. 428, 379 P.2d 73.\n\nPurpose of notice.— Principal underlying statutory requirement of application, notice and hearing is to insure that change proposed in application will not impair rights of other appropriators.City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179.\n\nAuthority of state engineer is limited to public water,and so far as his denial of an application was based upon finding of impairment of rights of Pecos river appropriators or other (privately owned) drain rights, his action was founded upon an error of law.Reynolds v. Wiggins, 1964-NMSC-252, 74 N.M. 670, 397 P.2d 469.\n\nJurisdiction and duties of state engineer with reference to streams and underground waters relates to public waters, subject to use by prior appropriators.City of Albuquerque v. Reynolds, 1962-NMSC-173, 71 N.M. 428, 379 P.2d 73.\n\nWater not already appropriated.— State engineer can only grant permits to appropriate waters which are not already appropriated.Templeton v. Pecos Valley Artesian Conservancy Dist., 1958-NMSC-131, 65 N.M. 59, 332 P.2d 465.\n\nIn determining whether to issue permit, the state engineer considers the applicant's application and grants it if there are unappropriated waters or if the proposed appropriation would not impair existing water rights from the source, is not contrary to the conservation of water within the state, and is not detrimental to the public welfare of the state.Hanson v. Turney, 2004-NMCA-069, 136 N.M. 1, 94 P.3d 1.\n\nClaim outside jurisdiction of state engineer.— Claim of city that it owned appropriative right of such nature that it did not legally require the very permit for which application was made, is not contemplated by this section and for this reason alone could not lawfully have been considered by state engineer.City of Albuquerque v. Reynolds, 1962-NMSC-173, 71 N.M. 428, 379 P.2d 73.\n\nState engineer has authority to approve application subject to conditions.City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179.\n\nPower to impose suitable conditions is inherent in broader power to prohibit and may also be expressly covered by portion of this section providing that, under conditions set out, state engineer shall grant application and issue permit to applicant to appropriate \"all or a part of the waters applied for.\"City of Albuquerque v. Reynolds, 1962-NMSC-173, 71 N.M. 428, 379 P.2d 73.\n\nAuthority to specify method of meeting conditions.— Having authority to condition approval, state engineer has authority to specify how condition is to be met under statute then in force.City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179.\n\nApplicant for underground water permit was not entitled to a post-decision evidentiary hearing.— Where applicant, after being denied an application for a permit to appropriate underground water from the San Agustin basin in 2007, filed with the state engineer a corrected application for a permit to appropriate the same underground water from the Rio Grande underground water basin in 2014, and where the state engineer denied the 2014 application, adopting the hearing officer's findings that although the 2014 application met the minimum requirements of 72-12-3 NMSA 1978 and was sufficiently different from the previous iteration so as not to be barred under the principle of res judicata, the permit would deprive the public of its right to appropriate water for beneficial use, and where applicant filed a motion for a post-decision hearing pursuant to 72-2-16 NMSA 1978, arguing that it was entitled to an evidentiary hearing, the district court did not err in determining that applicant was not entitled to a post-decision evidentiary hearing, because applicant was provided the necessary and appropriate process in a summary judgment hearing before the state engineer rendered its decision. An applicant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing in every circumstance; a party only has a statutory right to a post-decision hearing if certain preconditions are met and if an adverse decision was entered without a prior hearing.Augustin Plains Ranch v. D'Antonio, 2023-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nDistrict court's decision denying application for permit to appropriate groundwater was supported by the evidence.— Where plaintiff, a limited liability company formed to obtain water for the Campbell ranch master plan project, a multiple use development consisting of four villages with residential, commercial, and resort elements spread among Bernalillo county, Sandoval county, and Santa Fe county, sought a permit to appropriate groundwater from the Sandia underground water basin, the district court did not err in denying plaintiff's request to appropriate water from the Sandia basin, because testimony that approximately 100 existing wells would be impaired and that predicted higher temperatures and severe droughts were likely to have a negative effect on the supply of water in the next fifty years supported the district court's decision that the magnitude of likely impairment to existing water rights was significant and that the application was contrary to conservation of water.Aquifer Science, LLC v. Verhines, 2023-NMCA-020, cert. denied.\n\nDistrict court abused its discretion in applying collateral estoppel to corrected application.— Where applicant, after being denied an application for a permit to appropriate underground water from the San Agustin basin in 2007, filed with the state engineer a corrected application for a permit to appropriate the same underground water from the Rio Grande underground water basin in 2014, and where the state engineer denied the 2014 application, adopting the hearing officer's findings that although the 2014 application met the minimum requirements of 72-12-3 NMSA 1978 and was sufficiently different from the previous iteration so as not to be barred under the principle of res judicata, the permit would deprive the public of its right to appropriate water for beneficial use, the district court abused its discretion in determining that the 2014 application was barred by collateral estoppel and in denying the application with prejudice, because collateral estoppel is an equitable doctrine, and based on the prior determination that applicant could file a new application that addressed the facial insufficiencies of the 2007 application and the state engineer's policy of allowing corrected applications, it was fundamentally unfair to refuse to assess the facial adequacy of the more detailed 2014 application.Augustin Plains Ranch v. D'Antonio, 2023-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nDistrict court exceeded its appellate jurisdiction in dismissing application with prejudice.— Where applicant, after being denied an application for a permit to appropriate underground water from the San Agustin basin in 2007, filed with the state engineer a corrected application for a permit to appropriate the same underground water from the Rio Grande underground water basin in 2014, and where the state engineer denied the 2014 application, adopting the hearing officer's findings that although the 2014 application met the minimum requirements of 72-12-3 NMSA 1978 and was sufficiently different from the previous iteration so as not to be barred under the principle of res judicata, the permit would deprive the public of its right to appropriate water for beneficial use, and where applicant filed a motion for a post-decision hearing, arguing that it was entitled to an evidentiary hearing, and where the district court determined that the 2014 application was barred by collateral estoppel and dismissed the application with prejudice, the district court exceeded its appellate jurisdiction by examining the merits of the 2014 application. In the appellate capacity, it was not within the province of the district court to act upon the application itself, but to review the decision of the hearing officer for the state engineer.Augustin Plains Ranch v. D'Antonio, 2023-NMCA-001, cert. denied.\n\nConsideration of prior appropriations.— Although state engineer cannot conduct proceeding to adjudicate priorities of water rights, each time a permit is granted, he must consider all prior appropriations to determine whether or not there are any unappropriated waters; to that extent, he is required to consider prior appropriations.Templeton v. Pecos Valley Artesian Conservancy Dist., 1958-NMSC-131, 65 N.M. 59, 332 P.2d 465.\n\nDuty to determine question of impairment.— In reaching decision in connection with application, state engineer has positive duty to determine whether existing rights would be impaired.City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179.\n\nImpairment dependent on facts.— Whether there is an impairment of existing water rights depends upon the facts of each case.City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179.\n\nNo \"water right\" arises from private property pond.— Nowhere in Chapter 72, Article 12, is there any indication that a \"water right\" subject to impairment, and which provides standing to protest another's application for a permit, arises from the mere existence of a pond on private property.Town of Silver City v. Scartaccini, 2006-NMCA-009, 138 N.M. 813, 126 P.3d 1177.\n\nSource of pond water.— Unless shown otherwise by the person claiming some sort of a private right, the source of pond water, if no surface source is shown, is presumed to be underground water that is shared by other members of the public within the hydrologic model boundary.Town of Silver City v. Scartaccini, 2006-NMCA-009, 138 N.M. 813, 126 P.3d 1177.\n\nApplicants for use of underground water have burden of provingthat unappropriated water is available and that granting of their applications will not impair existing rights.McBee v. Reynolds, 1965-NMSC-007, 74 N.M. 783, 399 P.2d 110.\n\nCity as applicant for appropriation has burden of proving that its proposed well field would not impair existing rights.City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179.\n\nLowering of wells not necessarily impairment.— Finding that lowering of wells as result of city's appropriation of water would be of \"negligible effect\" on surrounding artesian wells did not require determination, as matter of law, that chemical quality of water in protestant's artesian wells would be impaired by lowering of water level in those wells by less than 0.16 feet.City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179.\n\nName on application.— Application for permit to appropriate public waters need not be in name of particular person or names of all standing to benefit from beneficial use of such waters.Mathers v. Texaco, Inc., 1966-NMSC-226, 77 N.M. 239, 421 P.2d 771.\n\nPriority of right.— Landowner who lawfully began developing underground water right and completed it with reasonable diligence acquired a water right with priority date as the initiation of his work even though the lands involved were placed within declared artesian basin before work was finished and water put to beneficial use.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Mendenhall, 1961-NMSC-083, 68 N.M. 467, 362 P.2d 998.\n\nDamage suit.— Water right owner is not restricted to hearing before the state engineer and appeal therefrom as exclusive remedy against impairment of his right by another; he has legal right to seek protection of or redress, including damages, for impairment of his water rights by another without first exhausting all administrative procedures available to him.Tevis v. McCrary, 1963-NMSC-084, 72 N.M. 134, 381 P.2d 208,appeal after remand, 1965-NMSC-051, 75 N.M. 165, 402 P.2d 150.\n\nWater rights separate property of wife.— Evidence in divorce action supported conclusion that certain property, including water rights stemming from permits issued by state engineer to appropriate underground water, perfected by the drilling of wells, were separate property of the wife and not community property.Paschall v. Paschall, 1968-NMSC-100, 79 N.M. 257, 442 P.2d 569.\n\nEstancia Basin.— Because the Estancia Basin is a declared basin, applicant, who wished to appropriate water from the basin, had to apply for a permit to appropriate water.Hanson v. Turney, 2004-NMCA-069, 136 N.M. 1, 94 P.3d 1.\n\n\"Description\" of land contemplated by section is legal descriptionand survey would be necessary. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-95.\n\nPurpose of notice.— Intention of this law is to give interested persons ten days after publication of notice in which to file protests to filed applications. 1937 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 37-1684.\n\nApplication not required for slight variation in place of use.— State engineer need not require application and publication of notice of change of place of use of underground waters when description of land actually irrigated varies only slightly from that shown on original application; however, should there be substantial variation or should acreage irrigated be noncontiguous to that shown on original application, then another application should be required. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-73.\n\nDetermination of substantiality of variation.— Duty of state engineer to enforce statutes carries with it responsibility to determine whether variation is substantial enough to require new application; in exercise of this responsibility, state engineer must use reasonable discretion. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-73.\n\nAppropriation determined case by case.— There is no statutory authority for state engineer to \"declare\" that no unappropriated water exists in an underground basin; under present law, the engineer must, and does, determine whether unappropriated water exists on a case by case basis. 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-23.\n\nConsideration of prior appropriations.— Each time application for permit to appropriate underground water is lodged before state engineer, he has duty to consider all prior appropriations to determine whether or not there are unappropriated waters. 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-23.\n\nApplicants for use of underground water have burden of proof. — Burden is upon applicant to demonstrate that unappropriated water exists or that no impairment of existing rights would be caused. 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-23.\n\nAppropriation procedure unlawful.— The state engineer's water rights dedication practice and procedure imposing a condition on the groundwater permit requiring that at some future time the applicant acquire and retire a specified amount of surface water rights in the related stream system is unlawful because it precludes full consideration of public welfare and water conservation resulting in an impairment of existing water rights at the time the new conditional water right is approved, since the rights are not identified until the permit is issued, preventing public notice and comment. 1994 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 94-07.\n\nNonconsumptive appropriation to be approved.— Even if no unappropriated water exists in an underground reservoir, an application for a new appropriation must nevertheless be approved, provided that it involves a nonconsumptive use of water, i.e., one that causes no net depletion of water in the reservoir and, therefore, does not impair existing rights. 1973 Op.

Lomos Altos, Inc., 2007-NMSC-002, 141 N.M. 21, 150 P.3d 971.\n\nIn a fully-appropriated basin, new depletions do not automatically constitute impairment as a matter of law.Montgomery v.

Reynolds, 1961-NMSC-003, 68 N.M. 61, 358 P.2d 626.\n\nRight subject to conditions.— Although right to change point of diversion or place of use is inherent property right incident to ownership of water rights, it is a right subject to conditions; it cannot impair other existing rights and it may be enjoyed only in accordance with statutory procedure.Durand v. Reynolds, 1965-NMSC-118, 75 N.M. 497, 406 P.2d 817.\n\nEffect of statutes restrictive.— Statutes governing change in point of diversion or change in well location do not grant, but rather, restrict right of appropriator to change point of diversion or well location.Public Serv. Co. v. Reynolds, 1960-NMSC-137, 68 N.M. 54, 358 P.2d 621;In re Brown, 1958-NMSC-113, 65 N.M. 74, 332 P.2d 475.\n\nAppropriation of unappropriated waters is not involvedin approval or rejection of application filed pursuant to this section.Mathers v. Texaco, Inc., 1966-NMSC-226, 77 N.M. 239, 421 P.2d 771.\n\nPurpose of requirements.— Principal underlying statutory requirements of application, notice and hearing is to insure that change proposed in application will not impair rights of other appropriators.City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179;In re Brown, 1958-NMSC-113, 65 N.M. 74, 332 P.2d 475.\n\nIssue of impairment.— Issue in proceedings hereunder is whether approval of application would impair existing rights, which issue state engineer has positive duty to determine.City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179.\n\nThe question of impairment of existing rights is a matter which must generally depend upon each application, and to attempt to define the same would lead to severe complications.U.S. v. Plains Elec. Generation & Transmission Coop., 1988-NMCA-011, 106 N.M. 775, 750 P.2d 475.\n\nLegislature did not intend to qualify term \"impairment\"by adding \"substantial\" thereto.Heine v. Reynolds, 1962-NMSC-002, 69 N.M. 398, 367 P.2d 708.\n\nImpairment dependent on facts.— Whether there is an impairment of existing water rights depends upon facts of each case.City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179.\n\nDistinction between holders and owners.— The legislature was aware of the distinction between holders of permits and owners of water rights.Hanson v. Turney, 2004-NMCA-069, 136 N.M. 1, 94 P.3d 1.\n\nThe absence of any reference to permit holders in Subsection A of this section is compelling evidence that the legislature did not intend to allow permit holders who had not yet applied any water to beneficial use to be considered owners of a water right.Hanson v. Turney, 2004-NMCA-069, 136 N.M. 1, 94 P.3d 1.\n\nWhere plaintiff took the initial step to obtain a water right, and had a right to appropriate water, her permits alone do not establish that she is the owner of a \"water right\" as that term is used in Subsection A of this section.Hanson v. Turney, 2004-NMCA-069, 136 N.M. 1, 94 P.3d 1.\n\nBurden on applicant to prove negative impairment.— Applicant has burden of proving that granting of its application would not impair existing rights of others.In re City of Roswell, 1974-NMSC-044, 86 N.M. 249, 522 P.2d 796;Spencer v. Bliss, 1955-NMSC-066, 60 N.M. 16, 287 P.2d 221;In re Hobson, 1958-NMSC-114, 64 N.M. 462, 330 P.2d 547;Heine v. Reynolds, 1962-NMSC-002, 69 N.M. 398, 367 P.2d 708;Durand v. Reynolds, 1965-NMSC-118, 75 N.M. 497, 406 P.2d 817;City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179.\n\nEngineer's duty to determine issue.— State engineer had positive duty to determine if existing rights would be impaired; and having found that they would be, there was no necessity under this section to further determine degree or amount of impairment.Durand v. Reynolds, 1965-NMSC-118, 75 N.M. 497, 406 P.2d 817;Heine v. Reynolds, 1962-NMSC-002, 69 N.M. 398, 367 P.2d 708.\n\nPublic policy strongly discourages application of estoppel against state engineerwhere the waters of the State are involved.Hanson v. Turney, 2004-NMCA-069, 136 N.M. 1, 94 P.3d 1.\n\nDelay alone would not constitute due process violation.— Where plaintiff complains that it took five years for the state engineer to deny her applications, and another three years for the district court to decide her appeal, delay alone would not constitute a due process violation entitling her to have her applications granted.Hanson v. Turney, 2004-NMCA-069, 136 N.M. 1, 94 P.3d 1.\n\nDegree of impairment immaterial.— District court was under no duty to find degree of impairment which would result if application were granted as once it determined that applicant had failed to prove there would be no impairment to existing rights, it had duty to deny application.In re City of Roswell, 1974-NMSC-044, 86 N.M. 249, 522 P.2d 796.\n\nChange in water class creates inference of impairment.— Although it is clear that all factors must be considered on a case-by-case basis, a change in water quality from Dregne and Maker class 1 to class 2 (or from class 2 to class 3) that would result from the granting of a permit creates a strong inference of impairment.Stokes v. Morgan, 1984-NMSC-032, 101 N.M. 195, 680 P.2d 335.\n\nMinimal increase in salinity not necessarily impairment.— New withdrawals which cause a minimal acceleration in the rate of saltwater intrusion or a minimal increase in salinity do not constitute impairment as a matter of law.Stokes v. Morgan, 1984-NMSC-032, 101 N.M. 195, 680 P.2d 335.\n\nProof of no impairment.— A showing of no impairment may be founded on two separate bases: (1) the proposed increase in pumping will not significantly accelerate the rate of intrusion of poor quality water, or (2) the quality of intruding water is still good enough to be used for existing purposes.Stokes v. Morgan, 1984-NMSC-032, 101 N.M. 195, 680 P.2d 335.\n\nLowering of wells.— Finding that lowering of wells as result of city's appropriation of water would be of \"negligible effect\" did not require determination, as matter of law, that chemical quality of water in protestant's artesian wells would be impaired by lowering of water level in those wells by less than 0.16 feet.City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179.\n\nLowering of water table.— Lowering of water table does not necessarily constitute impairment of water rights of adjoining appropriators, as whether there is impairment depends upon facts of each case.In re City of Roswell, 1974-NMSC-044, 86 N.M. 249, 522 P.2d 796.\n\nDenial justified on finding of impairment.— Where finding of impairment of existing rights was supported by substantial evidence, state engineer was justified in denying applicants' applications.Durand v. Reynolds, 1965-NMSC-118, 75 N.M. 497, 406 P.2d 817.\n\nProcedure requisite for well location change.— Owner cannot change location of well used to irrigate tract with vested right without following statutory procedure.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Mitchell, 1959-NMSC-073, 66 N.M. 212, 345 P.2d 744.\n\nNo authority to condition change of place of use of private water.— The state engineer, in granting a permit for a change of place of use, and after determining that the change of place of use will not impair existing rights, may not apply conditions which require that sewage effluent resulting from the use of the water must be returned to a natural water course, because the effluent is private water.Reynolds v. City of Roswell, 1982-NMSC-133, 99 N.M. 84, 654 P.2d 537.\n\nApplication to change use properly denied.— Where person had two permits to appropriate water but never put the water to beneficial use, and then filed applications to change the use from irrigation to subdivision use, the state engineer properly denied her requests, reasoning the failure to put the water to beneficial use meant that there was no \"water right\" to be changed.Hanson v. Turney, 2004-NMCA-069, 136 N.M. 1, 94 P.3d 1.\n\nEmergency permit not authorized.— State engineer has neither express nor implied authority to issue emergency permit for change in well location.In re Brown, 1958-NMSC-113, 65 N.M. 74, 332 P.2d 475.\n\nPrior hearing contemplated.— Section contemplates application, notice, hearing and approval prior to change in well location.In re Brown, 1958-NMSC-113, 65 N.M. 74, 332 P.2d 475.\n\nUnauthorized change misdemeanor.— Where appropriator changes well location prior to application, publication and hearing he is liable to prosecution under Section 72-12-11 NMSA 1978, whether or not such change in location is subsequently approved by state engineer.In re Brown, 1958-NMSC-113, 65 N.M. 74, 332 P.2d 475.\n\nWater right forfeited after illegal change in well location.— Unauthorized change in well location is a misdemeanor and if owner of vested water right changed location of his well after August 21, 1931, without following statutory procedure, and thereafter irrigated from new well for four consecutive years, it resulted in legal forfeiture of his water right.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Fanning, 1961-NMSC-058, 68 N.M. 313, 361 P.2d 721.\n\nUnauthorized change in well location is a misdemeanor and where owner of 40-acre vested water right changed location of his well after date basin was declared, without following statutory procedure, and thereafter irrigated from new well for four consecutive years, it resulted in legal forfeiture of his water right.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Mitchell, 1959-NMSC-073, 66 N.M. 212, 345 P.2d 744.\n\nSubsequent approval cures defect.— When appropriator has unlawfully changed well location without following statutory procedure, subsequent determination by state engineer, after notice and hearing, that rights of other water users will not be impaired, cures original defect in procedure.In re Brown, 1958-NMSC-113, 65 N.M. 74, 332 P.2d 475.\n\nState engineer has authority to approve application subject to conditions.City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179.\n\nState engineer initially, and district court on appeal de novo, had authority to approve the appellant's application subject to conditions necessary to prevent impairment of existing rights.In re City of Roswell, 1974-NMSC-044, 86 N.M. 249, 522 P.2d 796.\n\nState engineer has authority to specify how conditions he imposes are to be met.City of Roswell v. Berry, 1969-NMSC-033, 80 N.M. 110, 452 P.2d 179.\n\nOwnership of proposed location.— This section and Section 72-12-24 NMSA 1978 do not intimate that ownership of land to which point of diversion is to be changed is condition precedent to right to apply for authority to effect such change.Coldwater Cattle Co. v. Portales Valley Project, Inc., 1967-NMSC-089, 78 N.M. 41, 428 P.2d 15.\n\nApplication filed by nonprofit corporation which limited membership to property owners residing within boundaries of underground water basin who owned valid water rights therein for supplementation of such water rights as well as partial change of point of diversion on land not owned by the members was not constructive trespass, nor did such filing cast any cloud on title to land upon which supplemental wells were to be drilled.Coldwater Cattle Co. v. Portales Valley Project, Inc., 1967-NMSC-089, 78 N.M. 41, 428 P.2d 15.\n\nRight of entry required for construction.— Filing of application for drilling wells did not authorize applicant to enter upon land of another to sink wells or to construct canals or ditches; such right could not be exercised without lawful right of entry.Coldwater Cattle Co. v. Portales Valley Project, Inc., 1967-NMSC-089, 78 N.M. 41, 428 P.2d 15.\n\nAgent for owners.— Fact that nonprofit corporation, membership in which was limited to property owners residing within boundaries of underground water basin who owned valid water rights therein, did not own any water rights, did not affect corporation's capacity to act as agent in behalf of member owners.Coldwater Cattle Co. v. Portales Valley Project, Inc., 1967-NMSC-089, 78 N.M. 41, 428 P.2d 15.\n\nProcedure requisite for well location change.— State engineer may not allow replacement well to be drilled within 200 feet of original well without following notice procedure as set forth in this section. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-05.\n\nCommingling of waters.— In order to commingle waters, applicant would have to file application for change of place of use of both artesian well and shallow well; state engineer could approve applications subject to such conditions as reasonably were necessary to insure that there would not be increased use of water from either aquifer. 1959 Op.

      "text": "A. When for a period of four years the owner of a water right in any of the waters described in Sections 72-12-1 through 72-12-28 NMSA 1978 or the holder of a permit from the state engineer to appropriate any such waters has failed to apply them to the use for which the permit was granted or the right has vested, was appropriated or has been adjudicated, the water rights shall be, if the failure to beneficially use the water persists one year after notice and declaration of nonuser given by the state engineer, forfeited and the water so unused shall revert to the public and be subject to further appropriation; provided that the condition of notice and declaration of nonuser shall not apply to water that has reverted to the public by operation of law prior to June 1, 1965.\n\nB. Upon application to the state engineer at any time and a proper showing of reasonable cause for delay or for nonuse or upon the state engineer finding that it is in the public interest, the state engineer may grant extensions of time, for a period not to exceed three years for each extension, in which to apply to beneficial use the water for which a permit to appropriate has been issued or a water right has vested, was appropriated or has been adjudicated.\n\nC. Periods of nonuse when irrigated farm lands are placed under the acreage reserve program or conservation reserve program provided by the federal Food Security Act of 1985, P.L. 99-198, shall not be computed as part of the four-year forfeiture period.\n\nD. Periods of nonuse when water rights are acquired and placed in a state engineer-approved water conservation program by an individual or entity that owns water rights, an artesian conservancy district, a conservancy district, a soil and water conservation district organized pursuant to Chapter 73, Article 20 NMSA 1978, an acequia or community ditch association organized pursuant to Chapter 73, Article 2 or 3 NMSA 1978, an irrigation district organized pursuant to Chapter 73, Articles 9 through 13 NMSA 1978 or the interstate stream commission shall not be computed as part of the four-year forfeiture statute.\n\nE. A lawful exemption from the requirements of beneficial use, either by an extension of time or other statutory exemption, stops the running of the four-year period for the period of the exemption, and the period of exemption shall not be included in computing the four-year period.\n\nF. Periods of nonuse when water rights are acquired by incorporated municipalities or counties for implementation of their water development plans or for preservation of municipal or county water supplies shall not be computed as part of the four-year forfeiture statute.\n\nG. Periods of nonuse when the nonuser of acquired water rights is on active duty as a member of the armed forces of this country shall not be included in computing the four-year period.\n\nH. The owner or holder of a valid water right or permit to appropriate waters for agricultural purposes appurtenant to designated or specified lands may apply the full amount of water covered by or included in that water right or permit to any part of the designated or specified tract without penalty or forfeiture.\n\nI. Water deposited in a lower Pecos river basin below Sumner lake water bank approved by the interstate stream commission or an acequia or community ditch water bank shall not be computed as part of the four-year forfeiture period.\n\nHistory:Laws 1931, ch. 131, § 8; 1941 Comp., § 77-1108; 1953 Comp., § 75-11-8; Laws 1957, ch. 118, § 1; 1959, ch. 7, § 1; 1961, ch. 32, § 1; 1963, ch. 195, § 1; 1965, ch. 250, § 2; 1967, ch. 182, § 2; 1978, ch. 153, § 2; 1983, ch. 2, § 3; 1985, ch. 198, § 2; 1987, ch. 113, § 2; 1991, ch. 102, § 2; 1996, ch. 36, § 2; 1997, ch. 134, § 2; 1998, ch. 37, § 2; 2002, ch. 77, § 3.\n\nCross references.— For penalty for appropriation of forfeited water or water rights without permit,see72-12-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor state engineer,see72-2-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor comparable forfeiture provision relating to surface waters, see 72-5-28 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor water conservation program,see73-1-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the Food Security Act of 1985, P.L. 99-198,seeTitles 7, 15 and 16 of the United States Code.\n\nThe 2002 amendment,effective May 15, 2002, added Subsection I.\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective May 20, 1998, in Subsection D, inserted \"an individual or entity that owns water rights,\" and \"a soil and water conservation district organized pursuant to Chapter 73, Article 20 NMSA 1978\".\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective June 20, 1997, rewrote Subsection D.\n\nThe 1996 amendment,effective May 15, 1996, substituted \"for a period not to exceed three years for each extension\" for \"not to exceed a term of one year for each extension\" in Subsection B.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, inserted \"conservancy district or the interstate stream commission\" in Subsection D.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, in Subsection C substituted \"reserve program provided by the Food Security Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-198)\" for \"program provided by the Soil Bank Act (Public Law 540, 84th Congress)\".\n\nThe 1985 amendmentsubstituted \"Sections 72-12-1 through 72-12-28 NMSA 1978\" for \"Sections 72-12-1 through 72-12-10 NMSA 1978\" near the beginning of Subsection A and deleted the last sentence in Subsection F, relating to a water development plan for incorporated municipalities or counties.\n\nDistinction between holders and owners.— The legislature was aware of the distinction between holders of permits and owners of water rights.Hanson v. Turney, 2004-NMCA-069, 136 N.M. 1, 94 P.3d 1.\n\nAppropriative right to water is lost by nonbeneficial user thereoffor period of four years.State ex rel. Erickson v. McLean, 1957-NMSC-012, 62 N.M. 264, 308 P.2d 983.\n\nNew Mexico's groundwater forfeiture statute allows for partial forfeiture of water rights.— Forfeiture is an essential enforcement mechanism for New Mexico's beneficial use doctrine, and there is no distinction between partial forfeiture and forfeiture. Beneficial use is the measure of the water right, whether a water owner has ceased to use all of a water right or has ceased to use part of a water right, and therefore where petitioner, for more than four years, used only three acre-feet per year of water for livestock purposes from a claimed 394 acre-feet per year water right, the special master did not err in finding that New Mexico's groundwater forfeiture statute, § 72-12-8 NMSA 1978, allows for partial forfeiture and that petitioner forfeited his water rights above the three acre-feet per year for failure to put the water to beneficial use.State ex rel. Off. of St. Eng'r v. Romero, 2022-NMSC-022,aff'g2020-NMCA-001.\n\nPartial forfeiture is a potential consequence of non-use of a portion of groundwater rights.— Where defendant, after purchasing property where a water well was located, filed a declaration of groundwater rights with the state engineer, and where the declaration stated that the well was used from 1921 through 1966 for providing water to steam locomotives and from 1992 through 1995 for livestock watering purposes, the district court did not err in determining that defendant's underground water rights were forfeited and abandoned, except for the portion used for livestock purposes, because there was no direct evidence in the record that the water right was used for non-livestock purposes after the 1950s, and all or any part of a water right is subject to forfeiture when a person entitled to use of water fails to apply water to beneficial use for a period of four or more consecutive years.State ex rel. State Engineer v. Romero, 2020-NMCA-001, cert. granted.\n\nThe failure to file an application for extension of timeto place water to beneficial use prior to the expiration of the last extension granted does not automatically terminate water permits. Retroactive approval by the state engineer of applications for extension of time is permissible.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Aamodt, 1990-NMSC-099, 111 N.M. 4, 800 P.2d 1061.\n\nThe district court did not deprive appellants of due process in its forfeiture of water rights adjudication.— In consolidated appeals that arose from appellants' attempt to modify the point of diversion of water rights that had been dormant for decades, and where, in case 1, the district court, following an expedited inter se proceeding, concluded that appellants, through their predecessors, forfeited all Pecos river water rights in excess of 5,813.6 acre-feet per year and abandoned all but 150 acre-feet per year of the remaining water rights, and where, in case 2, the appellants appealed the district court's denial of their joint motion to intervene in writ of mandamus proceedings filed by appellees seeking that the office of the state engineer suspend or cancel preliminary authorizations for appellants to use the water rights pending the final determination of applications to change the point of diversion of their water rights, the district court did not deprive appellants of due process, because the procedure used in the expedited inter se proceeding properly safeguarded appellants' protected property rights by providing notice of the proceeding to all parties and providing appellants with an opportunity to be heard by allowing appellants to proffer evidence regarding its use of the water rights. Appellants also failed to argue that there was a risk of an erroneous deprivation of its water rights after the trial, and thus failed to demonstrate that there was a reasonable likelihood that the outcome might have been different with additional evidence.Carlsbad Irrigation Dist. v. D'Antonio, 2024-NMCA-024, cert. granted.\n\nThe district court did not err in its forfeiture adjudication.— In consolidated appeals that arose from appellants' attempt to modify the point of diversion of water rights that had been dormant for decades, and where, in case 1, the district court, following an expedited inter se proceeding, concluded that appellants, through their predecessors, forfeited all Pecos river water rights in excess of 5,813.6 acre-feet per year and abandoned all but 150 acre-feet per year of the remaining water rights, and where, in case 2, the appellants appealed the district court's denial of their joint motion to intervene in writ of mandamus proceedings filed by appellees seeking that the office of the state engineer suspend or cancel preliminary authorizations for appellants to use the water rights pending the final determination of applications to change the point of diversion of their water rights, the district court did err in its forfeiture adjudication, because there was substantial evidence to support the court's decision that appellants stopped beneficially using the nonconsumptive water rights in 1948 after appellants installed cooling towers and no long needed the water to cool potash ore at its refinery, and there was substantial evidence to support the court's conclusion that appellants forfeited the remaining water rights after 1963, based on a water master report provided by appellants that showed there was a nonuse period of at least four years for nonconsumptive and consumptive use water rights. Moreover, the record supports that no circumstances beyond appellants' control excused the nonuse.Carlsbad Irrigation Dist. v. D'Antonio, 2024-NMCA-024, cert. granted.\n\nThe district court did not err in the abandonment adjudication.— In consolidated appeals that arose from appellants' attempt to modify the point of diversion of water rights that had been dormant for decades, and where, in case 1, the district court, following an expedited inter se proceeding, concluded that appellants, through their predecessors, forfeited all Pecos river water rights in excess of 5,813.6 acre-feet per year and abandoned all but 150 acre-feet per year of the remaining water rights, and where, in case 2, the appellants appealed the district court's denial of their joint motion to intervene in writ of mandamus proceedings filed by appellees seeking that the office of the state engineer suspend or cancel preliminary authorizations for appellants to use the water rights pending the final determination of applications to change the point of diversion of their water rights, the district court did err in its abandonment adjudication, because there was substantial evidence to support the district court's decision based on appellants' nonuse of their water rights for an unreasonable period of time, creating a presumption of abandonment, and appellants failed to rebut this presumption by offering proof of some fact or condition excusing such nonuse or evidence of an intent not to abandon.Carlsbad Irrigation Dist. v. D'Antonio, 2024-NMCA-024, cert. granted.\n\nIssue of pro tanto forfeiture was not properly before court,as notice requirements of this section were not complied with; the only issues properly before court were existence of water right owned by defendants, and whether same had been lost by nonuse, forfeiture or abandonment.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Mears, 1974-NMSC-070, 86 N.M. 510, 525 P.2d 870.\n\nIrrigation district.— Length of time that irrigation district may hold right without putting water of that right to beneficial use is limited to four years, although, in discretion of state engineer, extensions of time may be granted beyond four-year period. 1964 Op.

Cook, 1991-NMCA-117, 113 N.M. 33, 822 P.2d 672, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 1, 820 P.2d 435.\n\nNo formal application to district court is requiredin taking appeal from decision of state engineer; appeal is taken simply by serving state engineer and interested parties with notice of appeal, filing notice with proof of service in district court and paying required docket fee.Plummer v. Johnson, 1956-NMSC-077, 61 N.M. 423, 301 P.2d 529.\n\nState engineer as proper party.— On appeal from his decision, state engineer becomes proper, if not indispensable, party.Plummer v. Johnson, 1956-NMSC-077, 61 N.M. 423, 301 P.2d 529.\n\nDeclaratory judgment suit premature.— Unless and until state engineer approved municipality's applications in whole or in part, in administrative proceeding pending before him, possible impairment of rights of others was speculative; hence, district court's determination of real party in interest in declaratory judgment action brought concerning state engineer's jurisdiction was premature.City of Hobbs v. State ex rel. Reynolds, 1970-NMSC-133, 82 N.M. 102, 476 P.2d 500.\n\nStanding to seek injunction.— Though artesian conservancy district owned no land serviced by waters of an artesian basin and no water rights, it constituted proper party plaintiff for maintaining suit to enjoin use of water from unauthorized well.Pecos Valley Artesian Conservancy Dist. v.
