Bassett, 2023-NMCA-033.\n\nThe district court was authorized to permit the attorney general to participate in the qui tam action after the attorney general initially declined to intervene.— In a qui tam action, where the district court entered a judgment that dismissed the plaintiffs' Fraud Against Taxpayers Act (FATA) claims in their entirety and also approved a settlement negotiated by the attorney general's office (AGO), and where the plaintiffs claimed that the AGO was without authority to seek dismissal of the FATA claims and approval of the settlement agreement when the AGO declined to intervene in the qui tam action, and that once the AGO declined to take over the case, plaintiffs became the sole representative of the state's interest, the district court did not err in allowing the AGO to participate in the qui tam action because § 44-9-6(F) NMSA 1978, expressly authorizes the court to permit the attorney general to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.State ex rel. Foy v. Vanderbilt Capital Advisors, 2022-NMCA-026, cert. denied.\n\nClaims preclusion.— Where plaintiff was an inmate of a correctional facility; defendant had a service contract with the corrections department to provide meals for inmates in the facility which required defendant to provide food for religious diets for inmates who were approved to receive a religious diet; in 2008, plaintiff sued defendant for damages on the ground that although defendant had been approved to receive a religious vegetarian diet, defendant had refused to provide plaintiff with an adequate vegetarian diet which prohibited plaintiff from freely exercising plaintiff's religion; and in 2010, plaintiff sued defendant for violation of the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act to recoup money paid to defendant by the corrections department on the ground that defendant refused to provide food of the nutritional content and quality specified in the service contract, the doctrine of claims preclusion did not bar plaintiff's 2010 lawsuit because in the 2008 lawsuit plaintiff, as an individual on plaintiff's own behalf, sought to recover damages for wrongful acts perpetrated by defendant on plaintiff personally and in the 2010 lawsuit, plaintiff, on behalf of and in the name of the state, sought to recover damages sustained by the state as a result of defendants false claims for compensation for non-conforming goods and services.State ex rel. Peterson v. Aramark Corr. Servs., LLC, 2014-NMCA-036.\n\nIssue preclusion.— Where plaintiff was an inmate of a correctional facility; defendant had a service contract with the corrections department to provide meals for inmates in the facility which required defendant to provide food for religious diets for inmates who were approved to receive a religious diet; in 2008, plaintiff sued defendant for damages on the ground that although defendant had been approved to receive a religious vegetarian diet, defendant had refused to provide plaintiff with an adequate vegetarian diet which prohibited plaintiff from freely exercising plaintiff's religion; and in 2010, plaintiff sued defendant for violation of the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act to recoup money paid to defendant by the corrections department on the ground that defendant refused to provide food of the nutritional content and quality specified in the service contract; the doctrine of issue preclusion did not bar plaintiff's 2010 lawsuit because the relevant issue in the 2008 lawsuit was whether plaintiff had been defrauded and the district court focused on the adequacy of plaintiff's vegetarian meals and the relevant issue in the 2010 lawsuit was whether defendant knowingly presented fraudulent claims for payment to the state and the district court focused on the adequacy of meals provided to all inmates in the facility.State ex rel.

      "text": "A. If the state or political subdivision proceeds with the action, it shall have the primary responsibility of prosecuting the action and shall not be bound by an act of the qui tam plaintiff. The qui tam plaintiff shall have the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations of this section.\n\nB. The state or political subdivision may seek to dismiss the action for good cause notwithstanding the objections of the qui tam plaintiff if the qui tam plaintiff has been notified of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the qui tam plaintiff with an opportunity to oppose the motion and to present evidence at a hearing.\n\nC. The state or political subdivision may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding any objection by the qui tam plaintiff if the court determines, after a hearing providing the qui tam plaintiff an opportunity to present evidence, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate and reasonable under all of the circumstances.\n\nD. Upon a showing by the state or political subdivision that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the qui tam plaintiff would interfere with or unduly delay the prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant or for the purpose of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the qui tam plaintiff's participation, such as:\n\n(1) limiting the number of witnesses the qui tam plaintiff may call;\n\n(2) limiting the length of testimony of such witnesses;\n\n(3) limiting the qui tam plaintiff's cross examination of witnesses; or\n\n(4) otherwise limiting the qui tam plaintiff's participation in the litigation.\n\nE. Upon a showing by a defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of litigation by the qui tam plaintiff would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation by the qui tam plaintiff in the litigation.\n\nF. If the state or political subdivision elects not to proceed with the action, the qui tam plaintiff shall have the right to conduct the action. If the attorney general or political subdivision so requests, the qui tam plaintiff shall serve the attorney general or political subdivision with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and all deposition transcripts in the case, at the state's or political subdivision's expense. When the qui tam plaintiff proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of the qui tam plaintiff, may permit the attorney general or political subdivision to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.\n\nG. Whether or not the state or political subdivision proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the attorney general on behalf of the state or political subdivision, or a political subdivision on its own behalf, that certain actions of discovery by the qui tam plaintiff would interfere with an investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than sixty days. The showing by the state or political subdivision shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the sixty-day period upon a further showing in camera that the state or political subdivision has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceeding with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceeding.\n\nH. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 44-9-5 NMSA 1978, the attorney general or political subdivision may elect to pursue the state's or political subdivision's claim through any alternate remedy available, including an administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If an alternate remedy is pursued, the qui tam plaintiff shall have the same rights in such a proceeding as the qui tam plaintiff would have had if the action had continued pursuant to this section. A finding of fact or conclusion of law made in the other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act. For purposes of this subsection, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court, if all time for filing an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.\n\nHistory:Laws 2007, ch. 40, § 6; 2015, ch. 128, § 5.\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective June 19, 2015, provided for the rights of a political subdivision when bringing an action pursuant to the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act; added \"or political subdivision\" throughout the section; in the catchline, added \"or political subdivision\"; in the introductory paragraph of Subsection D, after \"unduly delay the\", deleted \"state's\"; in Subsection G, after \"behalf of the state\", added \"or political subdivision, or a political subdivision on its own behalf\", after \"interfere with\", deleted \"the state's\" and added \"an\"; and in Subsection H, after \"Section\", deleted \"5 of the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act\" and added \"44-9-5 NMSA 1978\", and after \"remedy available\", deleted \"to the state\".\n\nThe district court was authorized to permit the attorney general to participate in the qui tam action after the attorney general initially declined to intervene.— In a qui tam action, where the district court entered a judgment that dismissed the plaintiffs' Fraud Against Taxpayers Act (FATA) claims in their entirety and also approved a settlement negotiated by the attorney general's office (AGO), and where the plaintiffs claimed that the AGO was without authority to seek dismissal of the FATA claims and approval of the settlement agreement when the AGO declined to intervene in the qui tam action, and that once the AGO declined to take over the case, plaintiffs became the sole representative of the state's interest, the district court did not err in allowing the AGO to participate in the qui tam action because § 44-9-6(F) NMSA 1978, expressly authorizes the court to permit the attorney general to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.State ex rel. Foy v. Vanderbilt Capital Advisors, 2022-NMCA-026, cert. denied.\n\nStandard of proof to find \"good cause\" for dismissal of qui tam action.— Good cause for dismissal of a qui tam action on behalf of a political subdivision exists where the dismissal is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, and not arbitrary, capricious, made in bad faith, based on improper or illegal motives, founded on an inadequate investigation, or pretextual. In exercising its discretion, the trial court may consider any matter relevant to the issue, including the relative merits of the action, the interest of the qui tam plaintiff, the purposes underlying the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act, and the potential waste of government resources.State ex rel. Foy v. Vanderbilt Capital Advisors, 2022-NMCA-026, cert. denied.\n\nThe district court applied an appropriate standard of proof to find \"good cause\" for dismissal of the qui tam action.— In a qui tam action, where the district court entered a judgment that dismissed the plaintiffs' Fraud Against Taxpayers Act (FATA) claims in their entirety and also approved a settlement negotiated by the attorney general's office (AGO), and where the plaintiffs claimed that the district court erred in dismissing the FATA claims, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing plaintiffs' claims or in approving the settlement agreement where the court detailed the AGO's extensive collection efforts taken apart from the FATA claims, and the court's observations and concerns about the viability and practicality of plaintiffs' litigation strategy were well-founded. Comparing the relative success of the AGO's alternative remedies with the lack of progress and built-in difficulties with plaintiffs' efforts supports the district court's decision. The district court did not err in concluding that the AGO's request to dismiss was well-founded, in good faith, not pretextual and based on adequate investigation.State ex rel. Foy v. Vanderbilt Capital Advisors, 2022-NMCA-026, cert. denied.\n\nQui tam plaintiffs not entitled to full-blown discovery prior to proposed settlement approval.— Although a qui tam plaintiff is entitled to discovery on the fairness of a proposed settlement, the discovery must be limited to effectuate the goal of allowing plaintiffs a meaningful participation in the fairness hearing without unduly burdening the state or political subdivision or the defendants, or causing unnecessary delay.N.M. State Inv. Council v. Weinstein, 2016-NMCA-069, cert. denied.\n\nWhere qui tam plaintiffs, in an appeal of the district court's approval of settlements in a qui tam action, argued that the district court denied all discovery, the district court did abuse its discretion in limiting discovery and denying plaintiffs' broad discovery requests that were unrelated to the factors the district court considered to assess the fairness, adequacy, and reasonableness of the settlements.N.M. State Inv. Council v. Weinstein, 2016-NMCA-069, cert. denied.\n\nDecisions in an alternate remedy proceeding dispose of claims in a qui tam action.— Where qui tam plaintiffs, in an appeal of the district court's approval of settlements in a qui tam action, argued that the district court acted beyond its jurisdiction when, in approving the settlements, the district court released the defendants from claims in an entirely separate case, the district court did not exceed its jurisdiction because the fact that a decision in a qui tam action may have an impact on another pending proceeding does not necessarily diminish the court's jurisdiction, and 44-9-6(H) NMSA 1978 contemplates the disposal of claims in a qui tam action by decisions rendered in an alternate proceeding.N.M. State Inv. Council v. Weinstein, 2016-NMCA-069, cert. denied.",

Except as otherwise provided in this section, if the state or a political subdivision proceeds with an action brought by a qui tam plaintiff and the state or political subdivision prevails in the action, the qui tam plaintiff shall receive:\n\n(1) at least fifteen percent but not more than twenty-five percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement, depending upon the extent to which the qui tam plaintiff substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action; or\n\n(2) no more than ten percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement if the court finds that the action was based primarily on disclosures of specific information, not provided by the qui tam plaintiff, relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, administrative or legislative hearing, proceeding, report, audit or investigation or from the news media, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the qui tam plaintiff in advancing the case to litigation. However, if the attorney general or political subdivision determines and certifies in writing that the qui tam plaintiff provided a significant contribution in advancing the case, then the qui tam plaintiff shall receive the share of proceeds set forth in Paragraph (1) of this subsection.\n\nB.

Whether or not the state or political subdivision proceeds with an action brought by a qui tam plaintiff:\n\n(1) if the court finds that the action was brought by a person that planned or initiated the violation of Section 44-9-3 NMSA 1978 upon which the action was based, the court may reduce the share of the proceeds that the person would otherwise receive under Subsection A or B of this section, taking into account the role of the person as the qui tam plaintiff in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation; or\n\n(2) if the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from that person's role in the violation of Section 44-9-3 NMSA 1978 upon which the action was based, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive a share of the proceeds. The dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the state or political subdivision to continue the action.\n\nD.

Proceeds and penalties collected by the state or political subdivision shall be deposited as follows:\n\n(1) proceeds in the amount of the false claim paid and attorney fees and costs shall be returned to the fund or funds from which the money, property or services came;\n\n(2) civil penalties shall be deposited in the current school fund pursuant to Article 12, Section 4 of the constitution of New Mexico;\n\n(3) except as provided in Paragraph (4) of this subsection, all remaining proceeds shall be deposited as follows:\n\n(a) one-half into a fund for the use of the attorney general in furtherance of the obligations imposed upon that office by the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act; and\n\n(b) one-half into the general fund; or\n\n(4) remaining proceeds collected by counties or municipalities as political subdivisions acting on their own behalf shall be disposed of in accordance with the direction of the governing body of the county or municipality.\n\nHistory:Laws 2007, ch. 40, § 7; 2015, ch. 128, § 6.\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective June 19, 2015, provided for the distribution of monetary awards when a political subdivision is successful in an action pursuant to the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act; added \"or a political subdivision\", throughout the section; in the catchline, added \"or political subdivision\"; in Paragraph (1) of Subsection C, after \"Section\", deleted \"3 of the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act\" and added \"44-9-3 NMSA 1978\"; in Paragraph (2) of Section C, after \"Section\", deleted \"3 of the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act\" and added \"44-9-3 NMSA 1978\"; in Subsection E, after \"agency counsel\", added \"or counsel employed by the political subdivision\"; designated the last sentence of Subsection E as new Subsection F and Paragraphs (1) through (3) of Subsection E as Paragraphs (1) through (3) of Subsection F; in Paragraph (2) of Subsection F, after \"New Mexico\", deleted \"and\"; in the introductory sentence of Paragraph (3) of Subsection F, after \"(3)\", added \"except as provided in Paragraph (4) of this subsection\"; in Subparagraph F(3)(b), after \"general fund\", added \"or\"; and added new Paragraph (4) of Subsection F.\n\nThe district court did not err in accepting the terms of the settlement agreement in the qui tam action.— In a qui tam action, where the district court entered a judgment that dismissed the plaintiffs' Fraud Against Taxpayers Act (FATA) claims in their entirety and also approved a settlement negotiated by the attorney general's office (AGO), and where the plaintiffs filed a motion asserting that the attorney fee provision of the settlement agreement was precluded by FATA, the district court did not err in denying plaintiffs' motion, because New Mexico has a strong public policy of encouraging settlements, the provisions of FATA do not prohibit a lump sum settlement, and the lump sum settlement agreed upon in this case was an acceptable way to resolve the qui tam action.State ex rel. Foy v. Vanderbilt Capital Advisors, 2022-NMCA-026, cert. denied.\n\nQui tam plaintiff's award is collateral to adjudication of the merits of the action.— The language of the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act, 44-9-1 to -14 NMSA 1978, contemplates resolution of the merits of the action before determination of the qui tam plaintiff's award and attorney fees, and therefore the calculation of the qui tam plaintiff's award is subsequent to and supplementary to adjudication of the merits of the action or resolution by settlement.N.M. State Inv. Council v. Weinstein, 2016-NMCA-069, cert. denied.\n\nWhere qui tam plaintiffs, in an appeal of the district court's approval of settlements in a qui tam action, argued that the district court's orders dismissing the defendants from the case were not final appealable orders because the orders did not adjudicate the share of the settlement that should be awarded to the qui tam plaintiffs or the amount of attorney fees that should be paid by the defendants, the pendency of the award issues did not render the dismissal order non-final, because the calculation of a qui tam plaintiff's award is subsequent to and supplementary to adjudication of the merits of a qui tam action or resolution by settlement, and where a post-judgment request, such as one for attorney fees, raises issues collateral to and separate from the decision on the merits, such a request will not destroy the finality of the decision.N.M. State Inv. Council v. Weinstein, 2016-NMCA-069, cert. denied.",

No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought pursuant to Section 44-9-5 NMSA 1978 against an elected or appointed state official, a member of the state legislature or a member of the judiciary if the action is based on evidence or information known to the state agency to which the false claim was made or to the attorney general when the action was filed.\n\nC. Unless the attorney general or political subdivision determines and certifies in writing that the action is in the interest of the state or political subdivision, no court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought pursuant to Section 44-9-5 NMSA 1978 when that action is based on allegations or transactions that are the subject of a criminal, civil or administrative proceeding in which the state or political subdivision is a party.\n\nD. Upon motion of the attorney general or political subdivision, a court may, in its discretion, dismiss an action brought pursuant to Section 44-9-5 NMSA 1978 if the elements of the alleged false or fraudulent claim have been publicly disclosed in the news media or in a publicly disseminated governmental report at the time the complaint is filed.\n\nHistory:Laws 2007, ch. 40, § 9; 2015, ch. 128, § 8.\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective June 19, 2015, included political subdivisions in the provision that bars certain actions pursuant to the Fraud Against Taxpayer Act; added \"or political subdivision\" throughout the section; in Subsection A, after \"Section\", deleted \"5 of the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act\" and added \"44-9-5 NMSA 1978\"; in Subsection B, after \"Section\", deleted \"5 of the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act\" and added \"44-9-5 NMSA 1978\"; in Subsection C, after \"Section\", deleted \"5 of the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act\" and added \"44-9-5 NMSA 1978\"; and in Subsection D, after \"Section\", deleted \"5 of the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act\" and added \"44-9-5 NMSA 1978\".\n\nCertain actions are barred.— For an action to be barred under Subsection B of this section, the action must be against a state official and be based on evidence or information known to the attorney general when the action was filed.State ex rel.

Austin Capital Mgmt., Ltd., 2015-NMSC-025,aff'g in part, rev'g in part, 2013-NMCA-043, 297 P.3d 357.\n\nWhere plaintiff, the former chief investment officer of the New Mexico education retirement board, filed a qui tam action, alleging that defendants, which included certain state officials, executed fraudulent schemes that led to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars at the expense of the state investment council and the education retirement board, the attorney general's prior knowledge of incriminating information did not bar the qui tam action because the attorney general's information was based on a prior qui tam action filed by plaintiff. Plaintiff was therefore not piggybacking off the claims of a prior relator in an effort to recover a portion of the prior relator's damage award. Moreover, plaintiff may have had genuine, useful information that the government lacked, and the attorney general did not raise an objection to the filing of the second qui tam action.State ex rel. Foy v.
