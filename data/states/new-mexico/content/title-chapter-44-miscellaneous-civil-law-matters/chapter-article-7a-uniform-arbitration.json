The Uniform Arbitration Act compiled as 44-7A-1 to 44-7A-32 NMSA 1978 was enacted effective July 1, 2001.\n\nMalicious abuse of process.— For purposes of the tort of malicious abuse of process, arbitration proceedings are judicial proceedings, and the improper use of process in an arbitration proceeding to accomplish an illegitimate end may form the basis of a malicious abuse of process claim.Durham v. Guest, 2009-NMSC-007, 145 N.M. 694, 204 P.3d 19,rev'g2007-NMCA-144, 142 N.M. 817, 171 P.3d 756.\n\nMalicious abuse of process in arbitration proceedings.— The plaintiffs' allegation that the defendant issued a subpoena during an arbitration proceeding for the purpose of extortion is sufficient to state a malicious abuse of process claim when the defendant did not initiate the arbitration proceeding against the plaintiffs.Durham v. Guest, 2009-NMSC-007, 145 N.M. 694, 204 P.3d 19,rev'g2007-NMCA-144, 142 N.M. 817, 171 P.3d 756 andoverruling in partDeVaney v. Thriftway Marketing Corp., 1998-NMSC-001, 124 N.M. 512, 953 P.2d 277.\n\nCases under prior law.— The pre-2001 cases below were decided under the former Uniform Arbitration Act, Sections 44-7-1 to 44-7-22 NMSA 1978. Because of the similarities between the two laws, the case annotations have been retained and included as annotations to the 2001 Uniform Arbitration Act.\n\nLegislative intent in enacting Uniform Arbitration Actand the policy of the courts in enforcing it is to reduce caseloads in the courts, not only by allowing arbitration, but also by requiring controversies to be resolved by arbitration where contracts or other documents so provide.Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Rose, 1979-NMSC-021, 92 N.M. 527, 591 P.2d 281;Daniels Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Jordan, 1982-NMSC-148, 99 N.M. 297, 657 P.2d 624.\n\nUniform Arbitration Act supersedes conflicting common-law authority.Andrews v. Stearns-Roger, Inc., 1979-NMSC-089, 93 N.M. 527, 602 P.2d 624.\n\nIn New Mexico, arbitration proceedings and awards are governed both by common law and by the Uniform Arbitration Act, but provisions of the act govern where the act conflicts with the common law. Daniels Ins.Agency, Inc. v. Jordan, 1982-NMSC-148, 99 N.M. 297, 657 P.2d 624.\n\nAnnounced policy of New Mexico favors and encourages arbitrationas a means of conserving the time and resources of the courts and the contracting parties, and to this end the legislature has assigned the courts a minimal role in supervising arbitration practice and procedures.K.L. House Constr. Co. v. City of Albuquerque, 1978-NMSC-025, 91 N.M. 492, 576 P.2d 752;Bernalillo Cnty. Med. Ctr. Employees' Ass'n Local 2370 v. Cancelosi, 1978-NMSC-086, 92 N.M. 307, 587 P.2d 960.\n\nUnlicensed business cannot compel arbitration.— Texas corporations unauthorized to do business in New Mexico were unable to compel two dentists to arbitrate a dispute arising from an alleged breach of architectural and construction contracts for the construction of dental offices because a suit to compel arbitration is essentially a suit for specific performance and the corporations, not licensed to do business in New Mexico, cannot perform.Shaw v. Kuhnel & Assocs., Inc., 1985-NMSC-008, 102 N.M. 607, 698 P.2d 880.\n\nThird-party beneficiary of arbitration agreement.— Where plaintiff entered into a title loan agreement with defendant; a condition of the loan required plaintiff to maintain insurance for the full value of the vehicle; plaintiff purchased the required insurance; the vehicle was subsequently involved in an accident that rendered the vehicle inoperable; and the loan agreement contained an arbitration provision which provided that plaintiff agreed to submit to arbitration all claims or disputes against all persons who may be liable to either plaintiff or the lender, the insurance company was a third-party beneficiary under the arbitration and could compel arbitration of plaintiff's claim against the insurance company.Rivera v. Am. Gen. Fin. Servs., Inc., 2010-NMCA-046, 148 N.M. 784, 242 P.3d 351,rev'd, 2011-NMSC-033, 150 N.M. 398, 259 P.3d 803.\n\nArbitration agreement to be interpreted by rules of contract law.— The terms of the arbitration agreement are to be interpreted by the rules of contract law.Christmas v. Cimarron Realty Co., 1982-NMSC-079, 98 N.M. 330, 648 P.2d 788.\n\nEquitable estoppel is applicable.— A nonparty to a contract may be equitably estopped from refusing to comply with a reasonable arbitration provision contained in the contract where the nonparty attempts to enforce some aspect of the contract.Damon v. StrucSure Home Warranty, LLC, 2014-NMCA-116.\n\nNonparties to an arbitration agreement.— Plaintiffs, as subsequent purchasers of a home and nonparties to a home warranty agreement, are bound by an arbitration provision contained in the warranty agreement if they directly seek the benefits of the warranty agreement.Damon v. StrucSure Home Warranty, LLC, 2014-NMCA-116.\n\nBoth statutory and common-law arbitration exist without conflict.— Since nothing is said in these provisions that common-law arbitrations are abolished, both methods of arbitration may exist, one under the statute and the other under the common law without conflicting with each other.Robinson v. Navajo Freight Lines, 1962-NMSC-043, 70 N.M. 215, 372 P.2d 801 (decision under former law).\n\nAgreement defines scope of jurisdiction of arbitration.— Parties contracting to resolve disputes by arbitration are bound by their agreement. The terms of the agreement define the scope of the jurisdiction, conditions, limitations and restrictions on the matters to be arbitrated.Christmas v. Cimarron Realty Co., 1982-NMSC-079, 98 N.M. 330, 648 P.2d 788.\n\nTerms of arbitration agreement govern disqualification of arbitrator.— Where defendants and contractor, who was hired to do concrete and framing work on defendants' property, entered into a binding arbitration agreement following a dispute regarding money due on construction work at defendants' property, and where contractor subsequently requested that the arbitrator be disqualified for refusing to perform his duties and for non-neutrality, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the parties' arbitration was subject to all the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), including the rule regarding disqualification of an arbitrator and that the AAA has the authority to disqualify a designated arbitrator if the AAA determines that such a disqualification is warranted under its rules and procedures, because the natural construction of the parties' arbitration agreement was that the parties intended to arbitrate disputes between them under all the AAA rules, and there was no language of limitation in the arbitration agreement demonstrating an intent to limit the scope of the AAA's rules.L.D. Miller Construction, Inc. v. Kirschenbaum, 2017-NMCA-030.\n\nArbitration agreement will be given broad interpretation.— When the parties agree to arbitrate any potential claims or disputes arising out of their relationships by contract or otherwise, the arbitration agreement will be given broad interpretation, unless the parties themselves limit arbitration to specific areas or matters. Barring such limiting language, the courts only decide the threshold question of whether there is an agreement to arbitrate.K.L. House Constr. Co. v. City of Albuquerque, 1978-NMSC-025, 91 N.M. 492, 576 P.2d 752.\n\nForum for resolution of disputed interpretation.— Where a complaint for declaratory judgment raises questions of law arising from the disputed interpretation of an arbitration contract, the proper forum for resolution of such questions is the trial court.Guaranty Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Valdez, 1988-NMSC-090, 107 N.M. 764, 764 P.2d 1322.\n\nDecision of joint committee subject to same standards as arbitrator's award.— Where the parties voluntarily submit a grievance to a joint management union committee for decision, the decision of that committee is subject to and governed by the same standards as an arbitrator's award, and is to be accorded the same finality.Andrews v. Stearns-Roger, Inc., 1979-NMSC-089, 93 N.M. 527, 602 P.2d 624.\n\nWhen trial court determines force of disputed contract.— When a petition is filed to compel arbitration pursuant to a contract's arbitration clause and the responding party denies the existence or validity of the contract, the trial court must determine whether the contract is still in force to compel the requested arbitration.Gonzales v. United S.W. Nat'l Bank, 1979-NMSC-086, 93 N.M. 522, 602 P.2d 619.\n\nDetermination of fraud in the inducement.— When a party challenges only an arbitration provision as fraudulently induced, the district court must decide this issue before sending the entire contract containing the arbitration provision to the arbitrator.Murken v. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Inc., 2006-NMCA-080, 140 N.M. 68, 139 P.3d 864.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Uninsured Motorist Arbitration,\" see 3 N.M. L.

      "text": "(a) An agreement contained in a record to submit to arbitration any existing or subsequent controversy arising between the parties to the agreement is valid, enforceable and irrevocable except upon a ground that exists at law or in equity for the revocation of a contract.\n\n(b) The court shall decide whether an agreement to arbitrate exists or a controversy is subject to an agreement to arbitrate.\n\n(c) An arbitrator shall decide whether a condition precedent to arbitrability has been fulfilled and whether a contract containing a valid agreement to arbitrate is enforceable.\n\n(d) If a party to a judicial proceeding challenges the existence of, or claims that a controversy is not subject to an agreement to arbitrate, the arbitration proceeding may continue pending final resolution of the issue by the court, unless the court otherwise orders.\n\nHistory:Laws 2001, ch. 227, § 7.\n\nCompiler's note.— Laws 2002, ch. 227, § 33 repealed the former Uniform Arbitration Act, Sections 44-7-1 to 44-7-22 NMSA 1978, enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 168, §23. The Uniform Arbitration Act compiled as 44-7A-1 to 44-7A-32 NMSA 1978 was enacted effective July 1, 2001.\n\nUnconscionability.— Unconscionability is an affirmative defense to contract enforcement. It is an equitable doctrine, rooted in public policy, which allows courts to render unenforceable an agreement that is unreasonably favorable to one party while precluding a meaningful choice of the other party.Peavy v. Skilled Healthcare Group, Inc., 2020-NMSC-010,aff'gNo. A-1-CA-35494, mem. op. (N.M. Ct. App. Oct. 22, 2018) (non-precedential).\n\nProcedural and substantive unconscionability.— Procedural unconscionability considers the factual circumstances of a contract's formation. Substantive unconscionability concerns the legality and fairness of the contract terms themselves.Peavy v. Skilled Healthcare Group, Inc., 2020-NMSC-010,aff'gNo. A-1-CA-35494, mem. op. (N.M. Ct. App. Oct. 22, 2018) (non-precedential).\n\nSubstantive unconscionability of an arbitration agreement.— Under New Mexico conscionability law, a presumption of unfair and unreasonable one-sidedness arises when a drafting party excludes its likeliest claims from arbitration, while mandating the other party arbitrate its likeliest claims. The presumption may be overcome by an evidentiary showing that justifies the one-sidedness of the arbitration agreement.Peavy v. Skilled Healthcare Group, Inc., 2020-NMSC-010,aff'gNo. A-1-CA-35494, mem. op. (N.M. Ct. App. Oct. 22, 2018) (non-precedential).\n\nAnalysis in determining substantive conscionability of an arbitration agreement.— When confronted with the substantive conscionability of an arbitration agreement, a court should first analyze the arbitration agreement on its face to determine the legality and fairness of the contract terms themselves, and second, if the court determines the arbitration agreement is facially one-sided, the court should allow the drafting party to present evidence that justifies the agreement is fair and reasonable, such that enforcement of the agreement would not be substantively unconscionable.Peavy v. Skilled Healthcare Group, Inc., 2020-NMSC-010,aff'gNo. A-1-CA-35494, mem. op. (N.M. Ct. App. Oct. 22, 2018) (non-precedential).\n\nArbitration agreements are substantively unconscionable when they are unfairly and unreasonably one-sided.— Where the estate of decedent filed a wrongful death lawsuit against defendant, a skilled nursing facility where decedent was a resident, and where, in response, defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration, citing an arbitration agreement that was attendant to decedent's admission agreement to the nursing facility, and where the arbitration agreement provided an exception stating that the agreement did not apply to either the facility or the resident in any disputes pertaining to collections, the district court did not err in denying defendant's motion to compel arbitration because the arbitration agreement was facially one-sided in that it excluded defendant's likeliest claim from mandatory arbitration, but required its residents to arbitrate their likeliest claims, and defendant failed to show that the arbitration agreement's collections exception was reasonable and fair.Peavy v. Skilled Healthcare Group, Inc., 2020-NMSC-010,aff'gNo. A-1-CA-35494, mem. op. (N.M. Ct. App. Oct. 22, 2018) (non-precedential).\n\nArbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable.— In a breach of contract case where plaintiff argued that the arbitration agreement provision of its subcontract with defendant should not be enforced because the provision was facially one-sided and thus was substantively unconscionable, and where the district court determined that the provision was not unconscionable and granted defendant's motion to compel arbitration, the district court erred in determining that the arbitration agreement was not substantively unconscionable, because to determine the substantive conscionability of a contract provision, a court must first analyze the arbitration agreement on its face to determine the legality and fairness of the contract terms themselves, and if the court determines the arbitration agreement is facially one-sided, the court should allow the drafting party to present evidence that the agreement is fair and reasonable, such that enforcement of the agreement would not be substantively unconscionable, and in this case, defendant conceded that the arbitration provision was facially one-sided, but failed to identify any legitimate, neutral reasons for it to exercise exclusive control over the manner in which any dispute arising from the subcontract was resolved. Contract provisions that unreasonably benefit one party over another are substantively unconscionable.Atlas Elec. Constr. Inc. v. Flintco, LLC, 2024-NMCA-046.\n\nDetermination of unconscionability of exceptions in arbitration agreement.— There is no bright-line, fixed, and inflexible rule that excepting from arbitration any claims most likely to be pursued by the defendant drafter will void the arbitration agreement as substantively unconscionable because the exception is unreasonably or unfairly one-sided and against New Mexico public policy. The issue is to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis based on evidence presented on the issues of unreasonableness, unfairness, one-sidedness, and public policy.Bargman v. Skilled Healthcare Grp., Inc., 2013-NMCA-006, 292 P.3d 1, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-012.\n\nWhere plaintiff, who was a patient in defendant's inpatient rehabilitation facility, signed an arbitration agreement that excluded disputes pertaining to collections; plaintiff sued defendant for damages arising out of the plaintiff's care at defendant's facility; the district court ruled that plaintiff did not have to arbitrate plaintiff's claims because the arbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable; and defendant argued that the collections exclusion was not unreasonable or unfair because collections disputes are not complex and involve small sums, that it is faster and cheaper for a patient and defendant to litigate collection claims rather than to arbitrate them, that under the arbitration agreement, defendant would have to pay the fees for three arbitrators to arbitrate the sums involved in collections which would not be cost effective and deprive defendant of a remedy when a patient failed to pay for services rendered, defendant should be permitted to present evidence tending to show that the collections exclusion is not unreasonably or unfairly one-sided such that enforcement of the collections exclusion is substantively unconscionable.Bargman v. Skilled Healthcare Grp., Inc., 2013-NMCA-006, 292 P.3d 1, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-012.\n\nArbitration provision not substantively unconscionable.— Where plaintiff purchased two used cars under separate finance contracts which contained provisions that retained self-help remedies for both parties, and that allowed either party to compel arbitration of any claim or dispute arising out of the contracts that exceeded $10,000, the district court erred in determining that the arbitration clause was unenforceable on the ground that it was substantively unconscionable under New Mexico law, because the arbitration provision and its carve-outs do not unreasonably benefit one party over another, and the carve-out provision's reservation of self-help remedies is irrelevant to the question of substantive unconscionability because they are private and nonadjudicatory by their very nature.Dalton v. Santander Consumer USA, Inc., 2016-NMSC-035,rev'g2015-NMCA-030, 345 P.3d 1086.\n\nPractical effect of agreement a factor in determining unconscionability.— Where an arbitration agreement contains provisions that unreasonably benefit one party over another, whether the one-sidedness is evident on the face of the agreement or whether its practical effect unreasonably favors one side, the arbitration provision is substantively unconscionable and unenforceable.Dalton v. Santander Consumer USA, Inc., 2015-NMCA-030, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-003.\n\nWhere plaintiff signed vehicle finance contracts that included arbitration agreements which contained facially neutral small claims court exemptions from arbitration, but where the practical effect of the exemptions preserved defendant's access to the courts to assert its most important claims, such as repossession, sale of the vehicle, and civil suits for deficiency judgments, while severely limiting plaintiff's access to the courts for consumer claims such as fraud and misrepresentation, the exemption provisions were unfairly and unreasonably one-sided in favor of defendant, and thus render the agreement to arbitrate substantively unconscionable.Dalton v. Santander Consumer USA, Inc., 2015-NMCA-030, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-003.\n\nContractual prohibition of class actions or arbitration.— Contractual provision which prohibited proceeding on a class-wide basis either in litigation or arbitration, as applied to claims that would be economically inefficient to bring on an individual basis, is contrary to the fundamental public policy of New Mexico to provide a forum for the resolution of all consumer claims and is unenforceable in New Mexico.Fiser v. Dell Computer Corp., 2008-NMSC-046, 144 N.M. 464, 188 P.3d 1215.\n\nArbitration agreement was not unconscionable.— Where a title loan agreement contained an arbitration provision which provided that all claims and disputes were subject to arbitration at the request of either party, except the lender's self-help or judicial remedies, including repossession or foreclosure, and that in the event of a default, the lender could exercise its rights in court and the debtor could not require the lender's action be arbitrated, the arbitration provision was substantively unconscionable and unenforceable.Rivera v. American Gen. Fin. Servs., Inc., 2010-NMCA-046, 148 N.M. 784, 242 P.3d 351,rev'd, 2011-NMSC-033, 150 N.M. 398, 255 P.3d 803.\n\nWhere a title loan agreement contained an arbitration provision which provided that all claims and disputes were subject to arbitration at the request of either party except the lender's self-help or judicial remedies, including repossession or foreclosure with respect to the vehicle that secured the loan, and that in the event of a default, the lender could exercise any other rights it had at law or equity or under the loan note or any instrument securing the loan note, including suing the borrower for amounts owed or repossessing any property given as security, the arbitration provision was not substantively unconscionable because the arbitration provision allowed the borrower to compel arbitration of disputes about the loan note itself and restored to the lender its statutory protections as a secured creditor or procedurally unconscionable as a contract of adhesion because there was no evidence that the lender had a monopoly on title loans in New Mexico or that the borrower would not be able to get a title loan under different terms through a different lender.Rivera v. American Gen. Fin. Servs., Inc., 2010-NMCA-046, 148 N.M. 784, 242 P.3d 351,rev'd, 2011-NMSC-033, 150 N.M. 398, 259 P.3d 803.\n\nArbitrability to be decided by the district court unless parties agree otherwise.— The general rule is that the arbitrability of a particular dispute is a threshold issue to be decided by the district court unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties decided otherwise under the terms of their arbitration agreement; a court shall order the parties to arbitrate if it finds that there is an enforceable agreement to do so.Juarez v. THI of New Mexico at Sunset Villa, 2022-NMCA-056.\n\nDelegation clause presented clear and unmistakable evidence the parties intended to have an arbitrator decide the threshold issue of arbitrability.— Where plaintiff was admitted to a care facility for rehabilitation following knee replacement surgery, and where, as a condition of her admission, signed an arbitration agreement, and where, approximately seven months after her admission, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant alleging claims of medical negligence and negligent hiring, training, supervision, and retention of employees, and where defendant moved to compel arbitration, asserting that there was no dispute that plaintiff signed the agreement for dispute resolution, that defendant was entitled to enforce the agreement, that the agreement was a valid, enforceable agreement supported by consideration, and that the delegation clause clearly required any questions about arbitrability be submitted to the arbitrator, the district court erred in denying defendant's motion to compel arbitration, because there was a valid contract, supported by consideration, to arbitrate between the parties, and the delegation clause clearly and unmistakably delegated questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator.Juarez v. THI of New Mexico at Sunset Villa, 2022-NMCA-056.\n\nThreshold question of arbitrability.— Where plaintiff, the personal representative of the wrongful death estate of decedent, brought a wrongful death action against defendants, a Rio Rancho skilled nursing facility and the management/employment entities for the nursing facility, following decedent's death while in defendants' care, and where the district court granted partial summary judgment to plaintiff based upon its rejection of defendants' affirmative defense regarding arbitration, which asserted that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction as a result of an enforceable arbitration agreement, and denied defendants' motion to compel arbitration, the district court did not err in refusing to delegate the interpretation of the arbitration agreement to the arbitrator, because the arbitration agreement in this case failed to specify that distinct threshold questions of arbitrability should be resolved by an arbitrator. Arbitrability of a particular dispute is a threshold issue to be decided by the district court unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties decided otherwise under the terms of the arbitration agreement.Hunt v. Rio at Rust Centre, 2021-NMCA-043.\n\nArbitration agreement was procedurally unconscionable.— Where plaintiff, the personal representative of the wrongful death estate of decedent, brought a wrongful death action against defendants, a Rio Rancho skilled nursing facility and the management/employment entities for the nursing facility, following decedent's death while in defendants' care, and where the district court granted partial summary judgment to plaintiff based upon its rejection of defendants' affirmative defense regarding arbitration, which asserted that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction as a result of an enforceable arbitration agreement, and denied defendants' motion to compel arbitration, the district court did not err in denying defendants' motion to compel arbitration, because the manner in which arbitration was presented to decedent's attorney in fact was procedurally unconscionable. The record demonstrates that defendants had vastly superior bargaining power compared to decedent's attorney in fact and the arbitration agreement did not give decedent's attorney in fact any authority to negotiate or modify the terms of the agreement; the inequality was so gross that the weaker party's choice was rendered effectively non-existent.Hunt v. Rio at Rust Centre, 2021-NMCA-043.\n\nThe district court did not err in refusing to submit the issue of arbitrability to arbitration.— In a wrongful death and negligence action arising from resident's stay at a hospital run by defendants, where resident's son signed an agreement on resident's behalf in connection with resident's admission to defendants' hospital, and where, in response to plaintiff's suit for wrongful death and negligence, defendants moved to compel arbitration, and where, after a hearing on the motion, the district court entered an order denying defendants' motion to compel arbitration, the district court did not err in refusing to submit the issue of arbitrability to arbitration, because there was no clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to delegate the issue of arbitrability. Arbitrability of a particular dispute is a threshold issue to be decided by the district court unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties decided otherwise under the terms of the arbitration agreement.Lopez v. Transitional Hospitals of N.M., 2023-NMCA-058.\n\nThe district court did not err in denying defendants' motion to compel arbitration.— In a wrongful death and negligence action arising from resident's stay at a hospital run by defendants, where resident's son signed an agreement on resident's behalf in connection with resident's admission to defendants' hospital, and where, in response to plaintiff's suit for wrongful death and negligence, defendants moved to compel arbitration, and where, after a hearing on the motion, the district court entered an order denying defendants' motion to compel arbitration, concluding that resident's son lacked authority to sign the agreement on resident's behalf, the district court did not err in denying defendants' motion to compel arbitration, because although resident executed a health-care directive listing her son as resident's health-care agent, the health-care directive stated that it took effect upon resident's incapacity, and defendants failed to meet their burden of showing that resident lacked capacity when her son signed the admission agreement, and thus failed in their burden of showing an agency relationship permitting resident's son to enter into arbitration on behalf of resident.Lopez v. Transitional Hospitals of N.M., 2023-NMCA-058.\n\nArbitration agreement was supported by consideration.— Where a title loan agreement contained an arbitration provision which provided that all claims and disputes were subject to arbitration at the request of either party except the lender's judicial and extra-judicial remedies with respect to collateral; and the agreement did not allow the lender to alter the agreement to arbitrate claims that the lender brings against the borrower, the arbitration agreement was supported by consideration.Rivera v. American Gen. Fin. Servs., Inc., 2010-NMCA-046, 148 N.M. 784, 242 P.3d 351,rev'd, 2011-NMSC-033, 150 N.M. 398, 259 P.3d 803.\n\nUnconscionable arbitration contract.— The provisions of a small loan company's arbitration form that limited a borrower to mandatory arbitration as a forum to settle all disputes whatsoever, while reserving for the lender the exclusive option of access to the courts for all remedies the lender was most likely to pursue against a borrower, are substantively unconscionable and unenforceable.Cordova v. World Fin. Corp. of N.M., 2009-NMSC-021, 146 N.M. 256, 208 P.3d 901.\n\nArbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable.— Where a nursing home admission agreement contained an arbitration agreement which provided that all disputes between the parties were subject to arbitration, but excepted guardianship proceedings, collection, and eviction actions initiated by the nursing home and disputes involving less than $2,500 from binding arbitration and provided that the excepted proceedings and actions were subject to litigation in court; and the most likely claims a nursing home would have against a resident relate to the collection of fees through guardianship proceedings and collection actions and the termination of services through eviction, the arbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable and unenforceable because the agreement exempted from arbitration the most likely claims that the nursing home would have against a resident, while subjecting the resident's most likely claims to arbitration.Figueroa v. THI of New Mexico, 2013-NMCA-077, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-010.\n\nSavings clause in unconscionable arbitration agreement could not be applied.— Where a nursing home admission agreement contained an arbitration agreement that was unconscionable because it exempted from arbitration the most likely claims that the nursing home would have against a resident, while subjecting the resident's most likely claims to arbitration, the exemption of certain claims from arbitration was so central to the agreement that, irrespective of the savings clause in the agreement, the exemption clause was incapable of separation from the agreement to arbitrate and severing the exemption clause and requiring the resident to arbitrate a claim that was unlikely to be litigated by the nursing home would perpetuate the unfairness for which the equitable unconscionablity defense is imposed.Figueroa v. THI of N.M., 2013-NMCA-077, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-010.\n\nWhere the terms of an arbitration agreement that plaintiff signed upon plaintiff's admission to defendants' nursing home required the parties to arbitrate all disputes associated with the agreement and the relationship created by the admission agreement, except disputes pertaining to collections or discharge of residents, the arbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable and unenforceable because the arbitration agreement permitted the nursing home to litigate its most likely and beneficial claims while excluding access to the courts for claims regarding negligent care, the most likely claims to be pursued by a resident.Ruppelt v. Laurel Healthcare Providers, LLC, 2013-NMCA-014, 293 P.3d 902, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-012.\n\nFederal Artibration Act not applicable to unconscionable arbitration contract.— The court's ruling that the provisions of a small loan company's arbitration form that limited a borrower to mandatory arbitration as a forum to settle all disputes whatsoever, while reserving for the lender the exclusive option of access to the courts for all remedies the lender was most likely to pursue against a borrower are substantively unconscionable and unenforceable is not inconsistent with the dictates of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 2.Cordova v. World Fin. Corp. of N.M., 2009-NMSC-021, 146 N.M. 256, 208 P.3d 901.\n\nUnconscionability analysis does not violate the Federal Arbitration Act.— The unconscionability analysis of arbitration agreements does not violate the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-6, because under New Mexico law, the unconscionability analysis is applied on an equal basis for all contracts to determine whether the terms of a contract are so unfairly unequal as to prevent enforcement of the contract.Figueroa v. THI of N.M., 2013-NMCA-077, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-010.\n\nWhere the membership of a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers has lapsed,the lapsed member cannot compel arbitration with a customer under the NASD rules after the lapse of the member's NASD membership.Medina v. Holguin, 2008-NMCA-161, 145 N.M. 303, 197 P.3d 1085.\n\nTerms of arbitration agreement delivered with shipment of goods.— A customer who purchases goods over the telephone or the internet; who is informed of the terms and conditions of the sale, including an arbitration agreement when the product is delivered; and who is given a specific number of days in which to return the product, is deemed to have accepted the terms and conditions, including the arbitration agreement, unless the product is returned within the specified time period.Fiser v. Dell Computer Corp., 2007-NMCA-087, 142 N.M. 331 165 P.3d 328,rev'd on other grounds, 2008-NMSC-046, 144 N.M. 464, 188 P.3d 1215.\n\nArbitration agreement was illusory and lacked consideration.— An employer's arbitration agreement which permitted the employer to unilaterally amend or revoke the arbitration agreement at any time after a claim had accrued, but before an arbitration proceeding had been initiated, was invalid because the employer's promise to arbitrate was illusory and lacked consideration.Flemma v. Halliburton Energy Servs. Inc., 2013-NMSC-022,rev'g2012-NMCA-009, 269 P.3d 931.\n\nArbitration agreement valid under Texas law that is unconscionable under New Mexico law is not enforceable in New Mexico under Texas law.— Where an arbitration agreement between plaintiff and defendant was formed while plaintiff was working for defendant in Texas; the arbitration agreement was enforceable under Texas law; while plaintiff was working for defendant in New Mexico, defendant terminated plaintiff; and the arbitration agreement permitted defendant to unilaterally amend or revoke the agreement at any time after a claim had accrued, but before an arbitration proceeding had been initiated, the arbitration agreement was not enforceable in New Mexico under Texas law because, under New Mexico law, the arbitration agreement was unconscionable and enforcing the arbitration agreement under Texas law would violate New Mexico public policy.Flemma v. Halliburton Energy Servs. Inc., 2013-NMSC-022,rev'g2012-NMCA-009, 269 P.3d 931.\n\nArbitration agreement was not illusory.— Where the defendant's dispute resolution program included binding arbitration of all employment-related disputes; the program provided that defendant reserved the right to amend or terminate the program at any time by giving at least ten days notice to current employees and that no amendment or termination would apply to a dispute for which a proceeding had been initiated; defendant fired plaintiff; and plaintiff sued defendant for wrongful retaliatory discharge and claimed that the arbitration agreement was not binding because it was illusory, the arbitration agreement was not illusory because defendant's right to amend any aspect of the dispute resolution program ended the moment plaintiff was fired, because plaintiff's status as a continuing employee was severed at that time.Flemma v. Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., 2012-NMCA-009, 269 P.3d 931, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-001.\n\nNo procedural unconscionability.— Where the resident was admitted to a resident health care facility; the resident designated an agent to complete the admission paperwork; the admission agreement included a form that required the resident to either reject or accept arbitration as the method of resolving disputes; the director of the facility reviewed the admission agreement with the agent, instructed the agent to read the dispute resolution form, and explained to the agent that if the agent wanted to reject arbitration, the agent had to mark and initial the appropriate box; the dispute resolution form stated that a resident's agreement to arbitrate was not a condition to admission and explained the consequences of choosing arbitration; the agent read the admission agreement at the facility and at the agent's home; and the agent chose arbitration, the circumstances surrounding the formation of the arbitration agreement did not render the agreement void for procedural unconscionable.Barron v. Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Soc'y, 2011-NMCA-094, 150 N.M. 669, 265 P.3d 720.\n\nNo substantative unconscionability.— An arbitration agreement that requires a buyer to arbitrate its claims against the seller, but does not require the seller to arbitrate its claims against the buyer, is not substantively unconscionable where the parties have provided each other with consideration beyond the promise to arbitrate.Fiser v. Dell Computer Corp., 2007-NMCA-087, 142 N.M. 331 165 P.3d 328,rev'd on other grounds, 2008-NMSC-046, 144 N.M. 464, 188 P.3d 1215.\n\nArbitration provision was substantively unconscionable.— Where an arbitration provision in a loan agreement provided that the arbitrator's decision was final and binding, and that if the claim exceeded $100,000 or granted or denied injunctive relief, either party could appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel; and the practical effect of the appeals provision was that small claims, over which the lender was unlikely to initiate proceedings, were required to be arbitrated, the lender was more likely to appeal claims that met the threshold for appealable claims, and the borrower's claims are more likely to fall below the threshold and be subject to arbitration only, the appeals provision was substantively unconscionable and unenforceable because it constituted an \"escape hatch\" clause that benefited the lender more than the borrower.Clay v. N.M. Title Loans, Inc., 2012-NMCA-102, 288 P.3d 888, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-009.\n\nAgreement to arbitrate legal malpractice requires client's informed consent.— Where an arbitration provision in an attorney-client contingency fee agreement provided that any dispute be submitted to arbitration, the arbitration provision was unenforceable absent the attorney informing his client that arbitration will constitute a waiver of important rights, including the right to a jury trial, because if an attorney is going to require his client, within the context of their relationship of trust, to waive the right to a jury trial for a future malpractice dispute, such a waiver should be made knowingly with the client's informed consent. For the purposes of obtaining informed consent, adequate communication will ordinarily include disclosure of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the situation, any explanation reasonably necessary to inform the client or other person of the material advantages and disadvantages of the proposed course of conduct and a discussion of the client's or other person's options and alternatives.Castillo v. Arrieta, 2016-NMCA-040, cert. denied.\n\nAn arbitration clauseis not unconscionable because it precludes class actions.Fiser v. Dell Computer Corp., 2007-NMCA-087, 142 N.M. 331 165 P.3d 328, cert. granted, 2007-NMCERT-006,rev'd, 2008-NMSC-046, 144 N.M. 464, 188 P.3d 1215.\n\nDenial of trial by jury.— A purchaser who is compelled to arbitrate based not on a statute, but on an arbitration agreement that is voluntarily entered into by the parties, is not denied the constitutional right to trial by jury.Fiser v. Dell Computer Corp., 2007-NMCA-087, 142 N.M. 331 165 P.3d 328, rev'd on other grounds, 2008-NMSC-046, 144 N.M. 464, 188 P.3d 1215.\n\nLegally enforceable contract required.Under either the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, or the New Mexico Uniform Arbitration Act, a legally enforceable contract is a prerequisite to arbitration; without such a contract, parties will not be forced to arbitrate.Heye v. Am. Golf Corp., Inc., 2003-NMCA-138, 134 N.M. 558, 80 P.3d 495.\n\nAuthority of agent to agree to arbitration.— Where the resident, who was mentally competent, alert and oriented, was admitted to a resident health care facility; the resident declined to complete the admission paperwork and told the director of the facility that the principal's grandchild would complete the paperwork; the grandchild told the director that the grandchild was assuming responsibility for the resident's care; the paperwork included a form that required the resident to either reject or accept arbitration as the method of resolving disputes; and the grandchild completed the paperwork and accepted arbitration, the grandchild had actual authority, which was not limited by the resident, and apparent authority to decide whether to reject or accept the arbitration clause in the admission agreement that was signed as part of the admission process and the grandchild's decision to accept arbitration was binding on the principal.Barron v. Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Soc'y, 2011-NMCA-094, 150 N.M. 669, 265 P.3d 720.\n\nUnder Federal Arbitration Act, whether valid contract to arbitrate exists is question of state contract law.DeArmond v. Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc., 2003-NMCA-148, 134 N.M. 630, 81 P.3d 573, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-003, 135 N.M. 51, 84 P.3d 668.\n\nDetermination of existence of arbitration agreement.— A court may not delegate to the arbitrator the court's obligation to decide the threshold issue of the existence of a binding arbitration agreement.Edward Family Ltd. P'ship v. Brown, 2006-NMCA-083, 140 N.M. 104, 140 P.3d 525, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-005, 139 N.M. 567, 136 P.3d 568.\n\nBurden of proof of unconscionability.— Unconscionability is an affirmative contract defense and the party alleging unconscionability has the burden to prove that the contract is unenforceable on that basis.Strausberg v. Laurel Healthcare Providers, LLC, 2013-NMSC-032,rev'g2012-NMCA-006, 269 P.3d 914.\n\nBurdens of proof.— The party seeking to compel arbitration bears the initial burden to prove that a valid contract exists, by generally showing that the contract is factually supported by an offer, an acceptance, consideration and mutual assent. Once the party who seeks to compel arbitration has satisfied the initial burden of proving the formation of a valid contract, the burden shifts to the party opposing arbitration to demonstrate that an affirmative defense, such as unconscionability, renders the contract unenforceable.Strausberg v. Laurel Healthcare Providers, LLC, 2013-NMSC-032,rev'g2012-NMCA-006, 269 P.3d 914.\n\nBurden of proof of validity.— When a nursing home relies upon an arbitration agreement signed by a patient as a condition for admission to the nursing home, and the patient contends that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable, the nursing home has the burden of proving that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable.Strausberg v. Laurel Healthcare Providers, LLC, 2012-NMCA-006, 269 P.3d 914, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-001,rev'd, 2013-NMSC-032.\n\nDistrict court did not shift burden of proving unconscionability.— The proponent of the affirmative defense of unconscionability bears the burden of proof, and where a party fails to adequately rebut an argument that an exemption from arbitration provision is unreasonably one-sided, the district court's agreement with the argument does not impermissibly shift the burden of proof.Dalton v. Santander Consumer USA, Inc., 2015-NMCA-030,rev'd on other grounds, 2016-NMSA-035.\n\nRule preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act.— The rule that a nursing home seeking to compel arbitration has the burden of proving that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable is preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, because the rule singles out arbitration agreements for special treatment by presuming that all nursing home arbitration agreements are unconscionable.Strausberg v. Laurel Healthcare Providers, LLC, 2013-NMSC-032,rev'g2012-NMCA-006, 269 P.3d 914.\n\nThe Federal Arbitration Act does not preempt the application of New Mexico's unconscionability doctrine to arbitration exemptions.— The New Mexico supreme court has consistently upheld the application of New Mexico's generally applicable unconscionability doctrine to one-sided arbitration agreements, consistent with the savings clause of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 2, which permits state courts to invalidate agreements to arbitrate via generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress or unconscionability, but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.Dalton v. Santander Consumer USA, Inc.,rev'd on other grounds, 2016-NMSA-035.\n\nThe employer failed to prove the elements of acceptance and mutual assentto an arbitration agreement contained in materials mailed to the employee's home which provided that continued employment would constitute acceptance of the agreement where there was no evidence that the employee actually read the agreement and the employer did not provide an agreement or acknowledgment form for the employee to sign; the court would not equate presumed receipt with actual knowledge.DeArmond v. Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc., 2003-NMCA-148, 134 N.M. 630, 81 P.3d 573, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-003, 135 N.M. 51, 84 P.3d 668.\n\nArbitration agreement to be interpreted by rules of contract law.— A valid arbitration contract must possess mutuality of obligation; mutuality means both sides must provide consideration.Heye v. Am. Golf Corp., Inc., 2003-NMCA-138, 134 N.M. 558, 80 P.3d 495.\n\nWhere an employment arbitration agreement was a preprinted form contract and there was no suggestion that the employer sought or received any input from the employee in connection with the drafting of the language, the agreement would be construed against the employer-drafter where it contained conflicting provisions.Heye v. Am. Golf Corp., Inc., 2003-NMCA-138, 134 N.M. 558, 80 P.3d 495.\n\nAn employment arbitration agreement which contained conflicting provisions as to whether it was binding on the employer, construed against the employer, gave the employer unfettered discretion to terminate arbitration at any time; the promise, therefore, was illusory and did not provide the consideration necessary to enforce the arbitration agreement.Heye v. Am. Golf Corp., Inc., 2003-NMCA-138, 134 N.M. 558, 80 P.3d 495.\n\nThe terms of the arbitration agreement are to be interpreted by the rules of contract law.Christmas v. Cimarron Realty Co., 1982-NMSC-079, 98 N.M. 330, 648 P.2d 788.\n\nArbitrator must initially determine scope of arbitration.— Where an employee agreed to arbitrate the employee's grievances; the arbitration agreement provided that the arbitration would resolve all matters raised in the employee's complaint and that the arbitrator had exclusive authority to resolve disputes relating to the scope of the arbitration agreement; there was a dispute between the employer and the employee as to the scope of the arbitration; the employee agreed with the employer to narrow the scope of the arbitration, while unilaterally reserving the right to litigate other issues; the employee did not raise the scope-of-arbitration issues with the arbitrator; the arbitrator ruled in favor of the employee; and the employee subsequently filed a lawsuit in which the employee alleged more expansive claims arising out of the same subject matter as the arbitration agreement, the employee was obligated to obtain a scope-of-arbitration ruling first from the arbitrator, and because the employee never obtained a ruling, the district court correctly dismissed the lawsuit.Home v. Los Alamos Nat'l Sec., L.L.C., 2013-NMSC-004, 296 P.3d 478.\n\nUnforeseeable conduct is not within the scope of an arbitration provision.— Claims based on conduct that is unforeseeable to the parties at the time of entering into an agreement, including an arbitration provision, are not within the scope of the arbitration provision as a matter of law.Clay v. N.M. Title Loans, Inc., 2012-NMCA-102, 288 P.3d 888, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-009.\n\nTort claim was not within scope of arbitration provision in loan agreement.— Where borrower signed a loan agreement with lender and used borrower's truck to secure the loan; the arbitration clause in the loan agreement required arbitration of any claim between borrower and lender that arose from or related to the agreement or the borrower's truck; borrower failed to repay the loan; when borrower resisted the attempt by employees of a repossession business to repossess the truck for lender, one of the employees shot borrower; and borrower sued lender alleging tort claims arising out of the shooting, borrower's tort claims were not within the scope of the arbitration provision because illegal or negligent conduct during repossession was outside the scope of the loan agreement and the arbitration provision.Clay v. N.M. Title Loans, Inc., 2012-NMCA-102, 288 P.3d 888, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-009.\n\nArbitration agreement valid under Texas contract law was enforceable in New Mexico.— Where, during the course of plaintiff's twenty-six years of employment with defendant, defendant on four separate mailings notified plaintiff that continued employment with defendant constituted plaintiff's acceptance of the terms of defendant's dispute resolution program, which included binding arbitration of all employment-related disputes; when plaintiff was assigned to work for defendant's international organization, plaintiff signed an agreement that plaintiff would remain employed by defendant and the terms of defendant's dispute resolution program would apply to plaintiff; while plaintiff was working for defendant in New Mexico, plaintiff sued defendant for wrongful and retaliatory discharge; under Texas law, plaintiff was presumed to have received the mailings and plaintiff's continued employment with defendant constituted acceptance of defendant's dispute resolution program; under New Mexico law, an employer is required to prove that an employee had actual notice of an offer and actual acknowledgement that continued employment constituted acceptance of the offer; and the only difference between Texas and New Mexico law was the evidentiary requirements of contract formation, the mere difference between Texas and New Mexico in terms of the evidentiary requirements of contract formation were insufficient to overcome the place-of-formation rule on public policy grounds, the arbitration agreement was enforceable under Texas law, and plaintiff was bound to arbitration.Flemma v. Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., 2012-NMCA-009, 269 P.3d 931, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-001.\n\nTest to determine whether a court may designate an arbitration provider.— If the parties' designation of a particular arbitration provider was integral to the parties' agreement to arbitrate, then the court cannot appoint a substitute arbitrator if the designated arbitrator is not available. If the parties' designation of an arbitration provider was an ancillary logistical concern, a court can appoint a substitute provider. An arbitration provider is an ancillary logistical concern where the arbitration provisions do not specifically designate a provider or give the parties a choice of providers. The express designation of a single arbitration provider; the designation of the rules of a specific arbitration provider; and mandatory, as opposed to permissive, contractual language are factors that indicate that a particular provider is integral to the parties' agreement to arbitrate.Rivera v. Am. Gen. Fin. Servs., Inc., 2011-NMSC-033, 150 N.M. 398, 259 P.3d 803,rev'g2010-NMCA-046, 148 N.M. 784, 242 P.3d 351.\n\nArbitration agreement was unenforceable.— Where the arbitration provision in a title loan agreement named the National Arbitration Forum exclusively throughout the provisions of the agreement, provided that the arbitration would be conducted under the rules and procedures of the National Arbitration Forum, required the parties to use the forms prescribed by the National Arbitration Forum, required the National Arbitration Forum to provide a list of potential arbitrators, provided that the National Arbitration Forum would determine the costs each party would pay; and the National Arbitration Forum was precluded from arbitrating consumer disputes, the arbitration provision was unenforceable because arbitration before the National Arbitration Forum was integral to the agreement to arbitrate, precluding a court from appointing a substitute arbitrator.Rivera v. Am. Gen. Fin. Servs., Inc., 2011-NMSC-033, 150 N.M. 398, 259 P.3d 803,rev'g2010-NMCA-046, 148 N.M. 784, 242 P.3d 351.\n\nAgreement defines scope of jurisdiction of arbitration.— Parties contracting to resolve disputes by arbitration are bound by their agreement. The terms of the agreement define the scope of the jurisdiction, conditions, limitations and restrictions on the matters to be arbitrated.Christmas v. Cimarron Realty Co., 1982-NMSC-079, 98 N.M. 330, 648 P.2d 788.\n\nClaim not within the scope of arbitration provision.— Where the focus of the arbitration provision contained in a warranty package for new homes was on the warranty against defects and the repair and replacement of covered defects in the new homes, and even though the arbitration provision included claims of breach of contract and negligent or intentional misrepresentation, the arbitration provision did not apply to representations made to prospective purchasers that the land adjacent to the new homes would remain open space.Campos v. Homes by Joe Boyden, LLC, 2006-NMCA-086, 140 N.M. 122, 140 P.3d 543, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-007, 140 N.M. 279, 142 P.3d 360.\n\nWaiver of exclusive authority of arbitrator to decide arbitrability.— Where the terms of an arbitration agreement that plaintiff signed upon plaintiff's admission to defendants' nursing home required the parties to arbitrate all disputes associated with the agreement and the relationship created by the admission agreement, except disputes pertaining to collections or discharge of residents; plaintiff challenged the enforceability of the entire arbitration agreement; and defendants voluntarily addressed the enforceability of the arbitration agreement in district court and never suggested that the district court did not have authority to address the issue, defendants waived their argument that the arbitrator had exclusive authority to decide arbitrability.Ruppelt v. Laurel Healthcare Providers, LLC, 2013-NMCA-014, 293 P.3d 902, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-012.\n\nWhere arbitration agreement was not supported by consideration,no contract was formed.Piano v. Premier Distrib. Co., 2005-NMCA-018, 137 N.M. 57, 107 P.3d 11, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-003, 137 N.M. 290, 110 P.3d 73.\n\nContinued at-will employmentis an illusory promise that cannot be consideration for an arbitration agreement.Piano v. Premier Distrib. Co., 2005-NMCA-018, 137 N.M. 57, 107 P.3d 11, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-003, 137 N.M. 290, 110 P.3d 73.\n\nArbitration agreement will be given broad interpretation.— When the parties agree to arbitrate any potential claims or disputes arising out of their relationships by contract or otherwise, the arbitration agreement will be given broad interpretation, unless the parties themselves limit arbitration to specific areas or matters. Barring such limiting language, the courts only decide the threshold question of whether there is an agreement to arbitrate.K.L. House Constr. Co. v. City of Albuquerque, 1978-NMSC-025, 91 N.M. 492, 576 P.2d 752.\n\nAbility to unilaterally change agreement.— One party's promise to arbitrate is illusory where it retained the ability to unilaterally change the arbitration agreement.Piano v. Premier Distrib. Co., 2005-NMCA-018, 137 N.M. 57, 107 P.3d 11, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-003, 137 N.M. 290, 110 P.3d 73.\n\nForum for resolution of disputed interpretation.— Where a complaint for declaratory judgment raises questions of law arising from the disputed interpretation of an arbitration contract, the proper forum for resolution of such questions is the trial court.Guaranty Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Valdez, 1988-NMSC-090, 107 N.M. 764, 764 P.2d 1322.\n\nArbitration not binding.— To the extent that, pursuant to contract, arbitration is not binding, there exists no arbitration agreement to be bound by an arbitrator's award, and, therefore, a party with a contractual right to an appeal de novo, as well as an aggrieved party under Section 66-5-303 NMSA 1978, the de novo trial provision of the uninsured motorist insurance law, has a right to seek a de novo trial in district court.Allstate Ins. Co. v. Perea, 2000-NMCA-070, 129 N.M. 364, 8 P.3d 166,overruled byPadilla v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 2003-NMSC-011, 133 N.M. 661, 68 P.3d 901.\n\nWhen trial court determines force of disputed contract.— When a petition is filed to compel arbitration pursuant to a contract's arbitration clause and the responding party denies the existence or validity of the contract, the trial court must determine whether the contract is still in force to compel the requested arbitration.Gonzales v. United S.W. Nat'l Bank, 1979-NMSC-086, 93 N.M. 522, 602 P.2d 619.\n\nArbitration provision providing for limited de novo appeal substantively unconscionable.— The limited de novo appeal provision in an insurance contract, providing for mandatory arbitration which would be binding on both parties for any award of damages not exceeding the limits of the Mandatory Financial Responsibility Act but providing for de novo appeal by either party of awards over that amount, violates public policy and is void as substantively unconscionable.Padilla v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 2003-NMSC-011, 133 N.M. 661, 68 P.3d 901.\n\nQuestion of arbitrability is for the court to decide.— Where plaintiff filed a class action to challenge the validity of an online loan agreement; the loan agreement contained an arbitration provision in which the parties delegated questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator; plaintiff did not specifically challenge the validity of the delegation clause in the complaint; and when defendants filed motions to compel arbitration, plaintiff raised specific challenges to the validity of the delegation clause that were distinct from the challenges to the loan agreement, the court, not the arbitrator, had jurisdiction to determine the question of the validity of the arbitration provision.Felts v. CLK Mgmt., Inc., 2011-NMCA-062, 149 N.M. 681, 254 P.3d 124, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-006, 150 N.M. 764, 266 P.3d 633.\n\nCourt had jurisdiction to determine the scope of arbitration provision.— Where an arbitration provision in a loan agreement contained a \"delegation provision\" which defined an arbitrable \"claim\" to include disputes about the validity, enforceability, arbitrability, or scope of the arbitration provision, and the borrower specifically challenged the delegation provision by arguing that there was fraud in the inducement based on an alleged misrepresentation by the lender of the neutrality of the two organizations identified to administer the arbitration proceedings, and the fact that both organizations had stopped administrating arbitration of collections and that borrower justifiably relied on the representation of neutrality, the court had jurisdiction to determine the scope of the arbitration provision.Clay v. N.M. Title Loans, Inc., 2012-NMCA-102, 288 P.3d 888, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-009.\n\nBan on class-wide arbitration was unconscionable.— Where a loan agreement contained an arbitration provision that banned class-wide arbitration and substantial evidence showed that the likelihood that plaintiff's costs in bringing an individual claim would exceed plaintiff's damages was reasonably certain and that a meaningful remedy for plaintiff's claims was only available through class action relief, the class action ban in the arbitration provision was substantively unconscionable and unenforceable.Felts v. CLK Mgmt., Inc., 2011-NMCA-062, 149 N.M. 681, 254 P.3d 124, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-006, 150 N.M. 764, 266 P.3d 633.\n\nBan on class-wide arbitration was not severable from arbitration provision.— Where a loan agreement contained an arbitration provision that banned class-wide arbitration; the class action ban was a key limitation to the means by which the parties could resolve their disputes under the loan agreement; the class action ban was substantively unconscionable and unenforceable; and the class action ban was not severable from the remainder of the arbitration provision, the entire arbitration provision was unenforceable.Felts v. CLK Mgmt., Inc., 2011-NMCA-062, 149 N.M. 681, 254 P.3d 124, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-006, 150 N.M. 764, 266 P.3d 633.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —4 Am.

If the court finds that there is an enforceable agreement to arbitrate, it shall order the parties to arbitrate.\n\n(c) If the court finds that there is no enforceable agreement, it may not pursuant to Subsection (a) or (b) order the parties to arbitrate.\n\n(d) The court may not refuse to order arbitration because the claim subject to arbitration lacks merit or grounds for the claim have not been established.\n\n(e) If a proceeding involving a claim referable to arbitration under an alleged agreement to arbitrate is pending in court, a motion under this section must be made in that court. Otherwise, a motion under this section may be made in any court as provided in Section 28 [44-7A-28 NMSA 1978].\n\n(f) If a party makes a motion to the court to order arbitration, the court on just terms shall stay any judicial proceeding that involves a claim alleged to be subject to the arbitration until the court renders a final decision under this section.\n\n(g) If the court orders arbitration, the court on just terms shall stay any judicial proceeding that involves a claim subject to the arbitration. If a claim subject to the arbitration is severable, the court may limit the stay to that claim.\n\nHistory:Laws 2001, ch. 227, § 8.\n\nCompiler's note.— Laws 2002, ch. 227, § 33 repealed the former Uniform Arbitration Act, Sections 44-7-1 to 44-7-22 NMSA 1978, enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 168, §23. The Uniform Arbitration Act compiled as 44-7A-1 to 44-7A-32 NMSA 1978 was enacted effective July 1, 2001.\n\nNo right to compel arbitration.— Where defendants offered investment packages to the public that consisted of interests in real property; plaintiff invested in three properties; defendants created the third parties to act as the seller of the real property; the purchase agreements contained arbitration clauses; plaintiff sued defendants for violations of the New Mexico Securities Act of 1986, Section 58-13B-1 NMSA 1978 et seq. [repealed]; plaintiff did not assert any claims against the third parties or allege any interdependent or concerted misconduct between defendants and the third parties; defendants filed complaints against the third parties for indemnity on the ground that the third parties sold the real property interests that comprised the alleged securities that plaintiff bought; defendants asserted the affirmative defense that plaintiff's claims were subject to the arbitration clauses in the purchase agreements; and the third parties filed a motion to compel arbitration on all disputes, defendants did not have an independent right to compel arbitration because the alleged violations of the Securities Act did not hinge on the terms of the purchase agreements and the third parties could not assert the arbitration defense because it could not be independently asserted by defendants.Frederick v. Sun 1031, LLC, 2012-NMCA-118, 293 P.3d 934.\n\nAn arbitration agreement contrary to public policy will not be enforced.— Where the state of New Mexico filed suit against ITT Technical Institute (ITT) claiming violations of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act (UPA) arising out of alleged misrepresentations to students about ITT's nursing program and its financial process, and where ITT filed a motion to compel arbitration in accordance with the arbitration provision, and accompanying confidentiality clause, in the students' enrollment agreements with ITT, which provided that any dispute be resolved by binding arbitration, the district court properly declined to enforce the confidentiality clause and properly denied ITT's motion to compel arbitration, because the state, under the UPA, has been given broad statutory authority to investigate violations and enforce the provisions of the UPA demonstrating New Mexico's fundamental public policy in favor of preventing consumer harm and resolving consumer claims, and it would be contrary to public policy to allow ITT to use the confidentiality clause with its students to shield itself from the state's investigation and litigation authorized under the UPA.State ex rel. Balderas v. ITT Educ. Servs., Inc., 2018-NMCA-044.\n\nArbitration agreement required.— The district court may not compel arbitration absent an arbitration agreement.Alexander v. Calton & Assocs., Inc., 2005-NMCA-034, 137 N.M. 293, 110 P.3d 509.\n\nWaiver.— A mere request for arbitration filed with the NASD cannot by itself be sufficient to waive the right to contest arbitration and require proof of the existence of an arbitration agreement in court.Alexander v. Calton & Assocs., Inc., 2005-NMCA-034, 137 N.M. 293, 110 P.3d 509.\n\nValid arbitration defense does not divest the court of jurisdictionand is not properly raised by a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. When parties have agreed to arbitrate, however, a court should order arbitration.Daniels Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Jordan, 1982-NMSC-148, 99 N.M. 297, 657 P.2d 624.\n\nRole of court.— Under this section, it is the court's duty to order arbitration where provision for it is clear. Where provision for arbitration is disputed, the court's function is to determine whether there is an agreement to arbitrate and to order arbitration where an agreement to arbitrate is found.Bernalillo Cnty. Med. Ctr. Employees' Ass'n Local 2370 v. Cancelosi, 1978-NMSC-086, 92 N.M. 307, 587 P.2d 960.\n\nArbitrability to be decided by the district court unless parties agree otherwise.— The general rule is that the arbitrability of a particular dispute is a threshold issue to be decided by the district court unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties decided otherwise under the terms of their arbitration agreement; a court shall order the parties to arbitrate if it finds that there is an enforceable agreement to do so.Juarez v. THI of New Mexico at Sunset Villa, 2022-NMCA-056.\n\nDelegation clause presented clear and unmistakable evidence the parties intended to have an arbitrator decide the threshold issue of arbitrability.— Where plaintiff was admitted to a care facility for rehabilitation following knee replacement surgery, and where, as a condition of her admission, signed an arbitration agreement, and where, approximately seven months after her admission, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant alleging claims of medical negligence and negligent hiring, training, supervision, and retention of employees, and where defendant moved to compel arbitration, asserting that there was no dispute that plaintiff signed the agreement for dispute resolution, that defendant was entitled to enforce the agreement, that the agreement was a valid, enforceable agreement supported by consideration, and that the delegation clause clearly required any questions about arbitrability be submitted to the arbitrator, the district court erred in denying defendant's motion to compel arbitration, because there was a valid contract, supported by consideration, to arbitrate between the parties, and the delegation clause clearly and unmistakably delegated questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator.Juarez v. THI of New Mexico at Sunset Villa, 2022-NMCA-056.\n\nStandard for granting motion.— As with a summary judgment motion, a motion to compel arbitration may only be granted as a matter of law when there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of an agreement; only then should the court decide the existence of the agreement as a matter of law.DeArmond v. Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc., 2003-NMCA-148, 134 N.M. 630, 81 P.3d 573, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-003, 135 N.M. 51, 84 P.3d 668.\n\nMotion to compel arbitration denied where contract contained conflicting arbitration provisions.— In a class action complaint, where plaintiff alleged that defendant violated New Mexico consumer protection law by charging more than the advertised price for a vehicle that plaintiff purchased from defendant, and where defendant moved to compel arbitration, arguing that although the parties entered into two contracts with contradictory arbitration provisions, the finance agreement was an integrated contract that superseded and replaced the buyer's agreement, resolving any conflict between the arbitration provisions in the two contracts, the district court did not err in denying defendant's motion to compel arbitration, because the merger clause relied on by defendant did not express the parties' intent that the finance agreement supersede or replace the buyer's agreement or the buyer's agreement arbitration provision; there was therefore no meeting of the minds between the parties as to arbitration, and no enforceable agreement to arbitrate.Martinez v. Gales Chevrolet Co., 2024-NMCA-051, cert. denied.\n\nEquitable estoppel is applicable.— A nonparty to a contract may be equitably estopped from refusing to comply with a reasonable arbitration provision contained in the contract where the nonparty attempts to enforce some aspect of the contract.Damon v. StrucSure Home Warranty, LLC, 2014-NMCA-116.\n\nNonparties to an arbitration agreement.— Plaintiffs, as subsequent purchasers of a home and nonparties to a home warranty agreement, are bound by an arbitration provision contained in the warranty agreement if they directly seek the benefits of the warranty agreement.Damon v. StrucSure Home Warranty, LLC, 2014-NMCA-116.\n\nNon-signatory to an arbitration agreement compelling arbitration.— Where plaintiff, a subcontractor that provided roofing labor, materials, and equipment for an apartment construction project, brought an action against the insurance company that issued a payment bond to cover the contractor's obligation to pay for labor, materials, and equipment, in an attempt to collect on a payment bond that provided the right to bring a lawsuit in the event of nonpayment by the contractor, and where the insurance company moved to compel plaintiff to arbitrate its claim pursuant to the arbitration clause in the contract between plaintiff and the contractor, and where plaintiff claimed that the insurance company, as a nonparty to the subcontract, is not entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement, the court held that plaintiff is equitably estopped from disavowing the arbitration agreement, because when a signatory to an arbitration agreement must rely on the terms of the agreement in making a claim against a non-signatory, equitable estoppel may apply to allow a non-signatory to compel arbitration.Rock Roofing, LLC v. Travelers Cas. & Sur. Co. of America, 413 F. Supp. 3d 1122 (D. N.M. 2019).\n\nUninsured motorist claim.— New Mexico law does not require arbitration of an uninsured motorist claim upon the unilateral demand of either the insurer or the insured where the insurance policy states that disputes regarding whether the insured is entitled to receive payment under the policy, or the amount of payment due, will be submitted to arbitration only if both the insurer and insured consent.McMillian v. Allstate Indem. Co., 2004-NMSC-002, 135 N.M. 17, 84 P.3d 65.\n\nNo judicial power to compel consolidated arbitration.— Absent express statutory authorization or agreement of all concerned parties, district court had no power to compel consolidated arbitration.Pueblo of Laguna v. Cillessen & Son, 1984-NMSC-060, 101 N.M. 341, 682 P.2d 197.\n\nWhen trial court determines force of disputed contract.— When a petition is filed to compel arbitration pursuant to a contract's arbitration clause and the responding party denies the existence or validity of the contract, the trial court must determine whether the contract is still in force to compel the requested arbitration.Gonzales v. United S.W. Nat'l Bank, 1979-NMSC-086, 93 N.M. 522, 602 P.2d 619.\n\nRight to arbitration not waived.— Where between the date a complaint was filed and the date a motion for arbitration was filed, the only pleadings filed were: (1) a complaint; (2) a motion to dismiss; (3) a first amended complaint; and (4) a motion requesting the trial court to submit the issues to arbitration, the case was not at issue and the right to arbitration had not been waived.Bernalillo Cnty. Med. Ctr. Employees' Ass'n Local 2370 v. Cancelosi, 1978-NMSC-086, 92 N.M. 307, 587 P.2d 960.\n\nRight to arbitration not waived by mere filing of complaint.— When the demand for arbitration follows initiation of proceedings in court, going to the merits of the dispute, a question of waiver is sometimes raised, but the mere filing of a complaint does not constitute a waiver of a right to arbitration.Bernalillo Cnty. Med. Ctr. Employees' Ass'n Local 2370 v. Cancelosi, 1978-NMSC-086, 92 N.M. 307, 587 P.2d 960.\n\nUnlicensed business cannot compel arbitration.— Texas corporations unauthorized to do business in New Mexico were unable to compel two dentists to arbitrate a dispute arising from an alleged breach of architectural and construction contracts for the construction of dental offices because a suit to compel arbitration is essentially a suit for specific performance and the corporations, not licensed to do business in New Mexico, cannot perform.Shaw v. Kuhnel & Assocs., 1985-NMSC-008, 102 N.M. 607, 698 P.2d 880.\n\nFraud in the inducement not issue for arbitrator.— It is for a court to determine issues of fraud in the inducement of a contract, not an arbitrator; if no fraud is found, the remaining issues can proceed to arbitration.Shaw v. Kuhnel & Assocs., 1985-NMSC-008, 102 N.M. 607, 698 P.2d 880.\n\nArbitration agreement was not illusory or unconscionable.— Where employee brought an action against employer, alleging sex and race discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the New Mexico Human Rights Act, negligent hiring and supervision, and wrongful discharge, and where employer moved to compel arbitration claiming that the parties had a binding arbitration agreement, and where employee claimed that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it was illusory and unconscionable, the court granted the motion to compel arbitration because the employee's claims were within the scope of the arbitration agreement, the arbitration agreement was not illusory because both parties provided adequate consideration, and the arbitration agreement was not unconscionable because employee had the opportunity and capacity to understand the agreement, and the arbitration agreement's terms were not patently unfair.Laurich v.

Harvard, 1981-NMSC-117, 97 N.M. 106, 637 P.2d 537.\n\nRecord on appeal to contain evidence of claims regarding vacation of award.— Where a party claims that the trial court should vacate the award because the arbitrator allegedly evidenced partiality and exceeded his powers, and the trial court judge reviews the record of the arbitration proceedings, but his findings do not indicate whether the record contains substantial evidence supporting or negating such claims, nor is the record of the arbitration proceedings made a part of the record for appeal, the case will be remanded to the district court to determine whether the arbitration record supports confirmation, or, in the alternative, vacation or modification of the award.Daniels Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Jordan, 1982-NMSC-148, 99 N.M. 297, 657 P.2d 624.\n\nAppellee may argue any grounds for affirmance.— An appellee who does not claim that the trial court erred in vacating an arbitration award has no duty to preserve that issue on appeal. It may argue any grounds for affirmance on appeal and the appellate court will uphold the trial court's decision if it is legally mandated, regardless of whether the trial court's rationale was wrong.Bruch v.

Co., 2003-NMSC-011, 133 N.M. 661, 68 P.3d 901.\n\nConsent to arbitration required.— By incorporating this section, 66-5-303 NMSA 1978 expressly contemplates a district court vacating an arbitration award where the parties did not consent to arbitration. It would be untenable, therefore, to hold that the legislature, in drafting the current uninsured motorist statute, intended to compel arbitration where the parties had agreed not to arbitrate.McMillian v. Allstate Indem. Co., 2004-NMSC-002, 135 N.M. 17, 84 P.3d 65.\n\nScope of review.— It is not the function of the court to hear the case de novo and consider the evidence presented to the arbitrators, but rather to conduct an evidentiary hearing and enter findings of fact and conclusions of law upon each issue raised in the application to vacate or modify the award.Melton v. Lyon, 1989-NMSC-027, 108 N.M. 420, 773 P.2d 732.\n\nOnce an arbitration award is entered, the finality of arbitration weighs heavily in its favor and cannot be upset except under exceptional circumstances.Melton v. Lyon, 1989-NMSC-027, 108 N.M. 420, 773 P.2d 732.\n\nErrors of law and fact.— The district court does not have the authority to review arbitration awards for errors as to the law or the facts; if the award is fairly and honestly made and if it is within the scope of the submission, the award is a final and conclusive resolution of the parties' dispute.Fernandez v. Farmers Ins. Co., 1993-NMSC-035, 115 N.M. 622, 857 P.2d 22.\n\nUnder appropriate circumstances the district court may find an arbitration panel's mistake of fact or law so gross as to imply misconduct, fraud, or lack of fair and impartial judgment, each of which is a valid ground for vacating an award.Fernandez v. Farmers Ins. Co., 1993-NMSC-035, 115 N.M. 622, 857 P.2d 22.\n\nLegal and factual mistakes, such as applying the wrong standard of proof, do not comprise an abuse of power under Subsection A(3) (now (a)(4)).Town of Silver City v. Garcia, 1993-NMSC-037, 115 N.M. 628, 857 P.2d 28.\n\nPreservation of objections.— Under Subsection (a)(5) of Section 44-7A-24 NMSA 1978, a party may continue to argue that there is no agreement to arbitrate even after arbitration is completed, so long as he preserves his objections before the hearing begins.Alexander v. Calton & Assocs., Inc., 2005-NMCA-034, 137 N.M. 293, 110 P.3d 509.\n\nAlleged misconduct of panel as grounds.— A trial court errs in refusing to hear evidence of an arbitration panel's alleged misconduct for its failure to hear evidence material to the controversy.Malibu Pools of N.M., Inc. v. Harvard, 1981-NMSC-117, 97 N.M. 106, 637 P.2d 537.\n\nMaterial evidence not excluded.— \"Material\" evidence is evidence that relates to the matter in dispute or has a reasonable bearing on the issue to be decided in a given case. In the instant case, the stipulated issue to be decided by the arbitrator was whether the policeman had sex with a minor while on duty. Evidence that the policeman had sex with women other than the minor while on duty is not material to the specific issue presented to the arbitrator for decision and thus does not provide a basis for vacating the arbitration award under Subsection A(4) (now (a)(3)).Town of Silver City v. Garcia, 1993-NMSC-037, 115 N.M. 628, 857 P.2d 28.\n\nArbitrator partiality.— To vacate an arbitration award under Subsection A(2) (now (a)(2)(A)), evidence of arbitrator partiality must be direct, definite and capable of demonstration rather than remote, uncertain, or speculative. Partiality cannot be imputed from the methods by which an arbitrator considers and evaluates evidence. Partiality cannot be inferred from adverse evidentiary rulings or from the enforcement of procedural rules.Town of Silver City v. Garcia, 1993-NMSC-037, 115 N.M. 628, 857 P.2d 28.\n\nThe arbitrator's predisposition to discredit testimony not yet given suggests that the arbitration award could be vacated due to the arbitrator's apparent lack of impartiality.Jaycox v. Ekeson, 1993-NMSC-036, 115 N.M. 635, 857 P.2d 35.\n\nArbitrator's right to appeal district court order vacating arbitration award.— Where husband and wife dissolved their marriage by stipulated judgment, and where, following a dispute over the implementation of the stipulated judgment, husband and wife entered into a settlement agreement that required the parties to submit all disputes or claims to final and binding arbitration, and where the district court vacated the arbitrator's arbitration award and disqualified the arbitrator from serving as arbitrator, finding that the arbitrator demonstrated evident partiality, the arbitrator had the right to appeal the district court's order because the arbitrator was a party under the settlement agreement and the district court's order directly and sufficiently aggrieved the arbitrator such that he had a right to appeal the order.Rogers v. Red Boots Invs., 2020-NMCA-028, cert. denied.\n\nStandard to evaluate claims of evident partiality.— To demonstrate evident partiality, the party seeking vacatur has the burden of proving that a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to the other party to the arbitration. Furthermore, the party asserting evident partiality must establish specific facts that indicate improper motives on the part of the arbitrator. A party need not prove that the arbitrator, in fact, had improper motives, but a party seeking vacatur must put forward facts that objectively demonstrate such a degree of partiality that a reasonable person could assume that the arbitrator had improper motives. The party challenging the award must prove the existence of evident partiality by clear and convincing evidence, which is evidence that instantly tilts the scales in the affirmative when weighed against the evidence in opposition and the fact-finder's mind is left with an abiding conviction that the evidence is true.Rogers v. Red Boots Invs., 2020-NMCA-028, cert. denied.\n\nNo abuse of discretion in vacating arbitration award.— Where husband and wife dissolved their marriage by stipulated judgment, and where, following a dispute over the implementation of the stipulated judgment, husband and wife entered into a settlement agreement that required the parties to submit all disputes or claims to final and binding arbitration, and where the district court vacated the arbitrator's arbitration award and disqualified the arbitrator from serving as arbitrator, finding that the arbitrator demonstrated evident partiality, the district court did not abuse its discretion in vacating the arbitration award because the arbitrator intentionally disregarded the district court's limitation on the arbitrability of a provision in the settlement agreement related to costs and fees and disregarded the district court's warning not to proceed to arbitration while a motion to appoint a new arbitrator was pending. The arbitrator's repeated disregard for the district court's ruling, in favor of husband and against wife, is direct, definite, and demonstrative evidence from which a reasonable person would have to conclude that the arbitrator was partial and had improper motives in favor of husband and against wife.Rogers v. Red Boots Invs., 2020-NMCA-028, cert. denied.\n\nRequesting trial if award exceeds statutory minimum.— The limited de novo appeal provision in an insurance contract, providing for mandatory arbitration which would be binding on both parties for any award of damages not exceeding the limits of the Mandatory Financial Responsibility Act but providing for de novo appeal by either party of awards over that amount, violates public policy and is void as substantively unconscionable.Padilla v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 2003-NMSC-011, 133 N.M. 661, 68 P.3d 901,overrulingBruch v. CNA Ins. Co., 1994-NMSC-020, 117 N.M. 211, 870 P.2d 749.\n\nBurden of establishing fraud.— The party asserting fraud must establish it by clear and convincing evidence and must show that due diligence could not have resulted in discovery of the fraud prior to arbitration.Foster v. Turley, 808 F.2d 38 (10th Cir. 1986).\n\nFraud, corruption and undue means established.— In a proceeding to vacate an arbitration award of uninsured motorist benefits, there was substantial evidence to support findings of fact and conclusions of law that the insured obtained the award through fraud, corruption, and undue means.Medina v. Found. Reserve Ins. Co., 1997-NMSC-027, 123 N.M. 380, 940 P.2d 1175.\n\nFailure to postpone.— Because the appellant was prejudiced by the arbitrator's failure to give him proper notice of the third hearing, and because the failure to give notice was sufficient cause to require the arbitrator to postpone the hearing, the trial court erred when it failed to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to Subsection A(4) (now (a)(3)).Jaycox v. Ekeson, 1993-NMSC-036, 115 N.M. 635, 857 P.2d 35.\n\nArbitrators authorized to suggest appropriate amount of punitive damages.— The arbitration panel did not exceed its powers where, in a dispute between an insured and the automobile insurance company, it suggested the appropriate amount of punitive damages to be assessed, if the proper court determined that punitive damages should be awarded.Stewart v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 1986-NMSC-073, 104 N.M. 744, 726 P.2d 1374.\n\nImproper licensure defense waived.— Where both parties agreed to have all their disputes settled by arbitration and participated fully in the process without objection or reservation, failure to raise the issue of proper licensure under 60-13-30A NMSA 1978, when the merits of the dispute were heard before the arbitration board, waived the issue as a defense.Spaw-Glass Constr.

The Uniform Arbitration Act compiled as 44-7A-1 to 44-7A-32 NMSA 1978 was enacted effective July 1, 2001.\n\nCross references.— For appeals generally,seeRules 12-201 to 12-216 NMRA.\n\nUntimely appeal.— Where, in an arbitration between a construction company and a hotel owner, the arbitrator determined an award in favor of the construction company which the hotel owner paid in full, including the award of attorney fees; almost one year later, in response to the district court's inquiry about the status of the arbitration, the construction company asked the district court to confirm the award and the hotel owner asked the district court to review the award of attorney fees; the district court confirmed the arbitration award, with the exception of the award of attorney fees, and remanded the question of attorney fees to the arbitrator for review; and the hotel owner never contested the arbitrator's award within the statutory deadlines for doing so, the hotel owner forfeited any right it might have had to contest the award in district court because, although the order of remand was appealable, as both an order confirming the award and denying the construction company's motion to confirm the award of attorney fees, the hotel owner failed to use the statutory remedies to challenge the award of attorney fees for almost a year.Journeyman Constr., LP v. Premier Hospitality II, 2013-NMCA-019, 293 P.3d 950.\n\nSection does not provide an exclusive list of orders that may be appealed.— By statute, the New Mexico court of appeals has jurisdiction over appeals from district courts in civil actions from any final judgment or decision, any interlocutory order or decision which practically disposes of the merits of the action, or any final order after entry of judgment which affects substantial rights. The question of whether an order concerning arbitration is appealable as of right depends on whether the order is final, and finality must be determined by applying the general law concerning finality of judgments in civil cases.N.M. Dep't of Health v. Maestas, 2023-NMCA-075.\n\nOrder denying motion to compel back pay was a final, appealable order.— Where the department of health (DOH) terminated petitioner from her employment, and where petitioner appealed her termination through arbitration as provided for under the collective bargaining agreement between the state of New Mexico and state employees, and where the arbitrator sustained petitioner's grievance and ordered DOH to reinstate petitioner and awarded petitioner back pay as of the date of her termination until the date of reinstatement, and where petitioner filed a motion to confirm the award as provided for under NMSA 1978, § 44-7A-23, and where the district court entered an order confirming the arbitration award and ordered DOH to reinstate petitioner and ordered back pay in accordance with the arbitration award, and where DOH provided petitioner with back pay but in doing so deducted the amount of disability and unemployment compensation payments petitioner had received during her period of unemployment, and where petitioner filed a motion in the district court seeking an order compelling DOH to pay her the full amount of back pay without the deductions, and where the district court denied the motion to compel, finding that DOH was entitled to offset petitioner's earnings as permitted by regulation, the order to compel was a final, appealable order because the district court was exercising its original jurisdiction when it denied petitioner's motion to compel full back pay and the order fully resolved the parties' dispute over the back pay deductions, and having disposed of the back pay dispute, there was nothing further to litigate in the district court.N.M. Dep't of Health v. Maestas, 2023-NMCA-075.\n\nRecord on appeal to contain evidence of claims regarding vacation of award.— Where a party claims that the trial court should vacate the award because the arbitrator allegedly evidenced partiality and exceeded his powers, and the trial court judge reviews the record of the arbitration proceedings, but his findings do not indicate whether the record contains substantial evidence supporting or negating such claims, nor is the record of the arbitration proceedings made a part of the record for appeal, the case will be remanded to the district court to determine whether the arbitration record supports confirmation, or, in the alternative, vacation or modification of the award.Daniels Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Jordan, 1982-NMSC-148, 99 N.M. 297, 657 P.2d 624.\n\nAppellee may argue any grounds for affirmance.— An appellee who does not claim that the trial court erred in vacating an arbitration award has no duty to preserve that issue on appeal. It may argue any grounds for affirmance on appeal and the appellate court will uphold the trial court's decision if it is legally mandated, regardless of whether the trial court's rationale was wrong.Bruch v. CNA Ins. Co., 1994-NMSC-020, 117 N.M. 211, 870 P.2d 749,overruled on other grounds byPadilla v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 2003-NMSC-011, 133 N.M. 661, 68 P.3d 901.\n\nStandard of review.— When reviewing whether the district court correctly confirmed an arbitration award, the appellate court determines whether substantial evidence in the record supports the district court's findings of fact and whether the court correctly applied the law to the facts when making its conclusions of law. Substantial evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as sufficient to support a conclusion. When determining whether a finding of fact is supported by substantial evidence, the appellate court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to uphold the finding and indulge all reasonable inferences in support of the district court's decision.Town of Silver City v. Garcia, 1993-NMSC-037, 115 N.M. 628, 857 P.2d 28.\n\nWaiver of right to compel arbitration.— Three principles govern appellate review of a district court's waiver finding in the context of a motion to compel arbitration: (1) the strong public policy preference in favor of arbitration, (2) relief should only be granted upon a showing of prejudice to the party opposing arbitration, and (3) the extent to which the party now urging arbitration has previously invoked the machinery of the judicial system.Tennyson v. Santa Fe Dealership Acquisition II, Inc., 2016-NMCA-017, cert. denied, 2016-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere defendants were alleged to have sold used cars to plaintiffs and others without disclosing the cars' accident history, plaintiffs filed a putative class-action lawsuit against defendants, and after nearly three years of extensive litigation, discovery, and an order certifying the action did defendants file a motion to compel arbitration. There was no error in the district court's finding that defendants' use of the judicial process, moving for dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint, engaging in extensive discovery, filing multiple motions for summary judgment, opposing class certification and appealing the district court's certification order, all while omitting any mention of an intent to compel arbitration, invoked the machinery of litigation in a manner inconsistent with their right to arbitrate and manifested an intent to waive their right to compel arbitration against absent class members to a degree that plaintiffs and the district court could properly rely.Tennyson v. Santa Fe Dealership Acquisition II, Inc., 2016-NMCA-017, cert. denied, 2016-NMCERT-001.\n\nAm.
