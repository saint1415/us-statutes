      "text": "The writ of mandamus is regulated as in this chapter prescribed.\n\nHistory:Laws 1884, ch. 1, § 37; C.L. 1884, § 1992; C.L. 1897, § 2760; Code 1915, § 3411; C.S. 1929, § 86-101; 1941 Comp., § 26-101; 1953 Comp., § 22-12-1.\n\nMeaning of \"this chapter\".— The original act, Laws 1884, ch. 1, was divided into three unnumbered divisions, habeas corpus, §§ 1 to 36; mandamus, §§ 37 to 50; and prohibition, §§ 51 to 56. The term \"this chapter\" appeared in the original act and apparently referred to the division containing §§ 37 to 50, presently compiled as 44-2-1 to 44-2-13 NMSA 1978.\n\nSection limits and defines court's mandamus power.— Under and by virtue of this section, the power of the court in a mandamus proceeding is limited and defined.Board of Comm'rs v. Dist. Court, 1924-NMSC-009, 29 N.M. 244, 223 P. 516.\n\nDenomination of pleading irrelevant since allegations and relief determine nature.— It matters not what the pleading initiating the proceeding may be denominated. If in truth is discloses by its allegations and the relief sought that it is an action in mandamus, it will be so treated.Laumback v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1955-NMSC-096, 60 N.M. 226, 290 P.2d 1067.\n\nFormal defects in petition for writ waived.— Because the motor vehicle division appeared generally in the case and subsequently did not answer or appear at any hearing, the division waived any formal defects in the petition for writ of mandamus.Barreras v.

      "text": "The district court has exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases of mandamus, except where such writ is to be directed to a district court or a judge thereof in his official capacity, in which case the supreme court has exclusive original jurisdiction, and in such cases the supreme court or a judge thereof shall first make a rule, returnable in term, that such district court or judge thereof, show cause before the court why a peremptory writ of mandamus should not issue, and upon the return day of such rule such district court or judge may show cause against the rule by affidavit or record, evidence, and upon the hearing thereof, the supreme court shall award a peremptory writ, or dismiss the rule. In case of emergency, a judge of the supreme court, at the time of making the rule to show cause, may also appoint a special term of the court for hearing the motion, and at which the rule shall be made returnable.\n\nHistory:Laws 1884, ch. 1, § 48; C.L. 1884, § 2003; C.L. 1897, § 2771; Code 1915, § 3423; C.S. 1929, § 86-113; 1941 Comp., § 26-103; 1953 Comp., § 22-12-3.\n\nCross references.— For the constitutional provision granting the supreme court original jurisdiction in mandamus, against state offices, boards and commissions, and power to issue writs of mandamus for the complete exercise of its jurisdiction,seeN.M.

Sego v. Kirkpatrick, 1974-NMSC-059, 86 N.M. 359, 524 P.2d 975.\n\nIssuance of mandamus by the Supreme Court.— The exercise of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction in mandamus may be appropriate when the petitioner presents a purely legal question concerning the non-discretionary duty of a government official that implicates fundamental constitutional questions of great public importance, can be answered on the basis of virtually undisputed facts, and calls for an expeditious resolution that cannot be obtained through other channels such as a direct appeal.State ex rel. Sandel v. N.M. Public Utility Comm'n, 1999-NMSC-019, 127 N.M. 272, 980 P.2d 55;In re. Adjustments to Franchise Fees Required by Electric Utility Industry Restructuring Act of 1999, 2000-NMSC-035, 129 N.M. 78, 14 P.3d 525.\n\nMandamus appropriate on issue of proper way to conduct primary election.— Where petitioners, twenty-seven county clerks, and respondent, the New Mexico secretary of state, submitted a stipulated petition for an emergency writ to compel the secretary of state to mail absentee ballots directly to all registered voters in lieu of conducting in-person voting for the June 2020 primary election, claiming that the primary election was scheduled amidst a global pandemic and national statewide public health emergency, that in-person voting could not be conducted safely under those circumstances, and that the requested relief was necessary to protect the health of election workers, voters, and the general public, and where intervenors argued that the Election Code, §§ 1-1-1 to 1-26-6 NMSA 1978, does not allow elections to be conducted entirely by mail and that it would violate separation of powers principles for a non-legislative branch of government to implement an alternative election procedure, mandamus was appropriate because the case involved a fundamental constitutional question of great public importance, involved a legal rather than a factual dispute, and required an expeditious resolution.State ex rel. Riddle v. Toulouse Oliver, 2021-NMSC-018.\n\nThe New Mexico secretary of state had a nondiscretionary duty to ensure that the 2020 primary election held during a pandemic was conducted in compliance with the Election Code and executive and public health orders.— Where petitioners, twenty-seven county clerks, and respondent, the New Mexico secretary of state, submitted a stipulated petition for an emergency writ to compel the secretary of state to mail absentee ballots directly to all registered voters in lieu of conducting in-person voting for the June 2020 primary election, claiming that the primary election was scheduled amidst a global pandemic and national statewide public health emergency, that in-person voting could not be conducted safely under those circumstances, and that the requested relief was necessary to protect the health of election workers, voters, and the general public, and where intervenors argued that the Election Code, §§ 1-1-1 to 1-26-6 NMSA 1978, does not allow elections to be conducted entirely by mail and that it would violate separation of powers principles for a non-legislative branch of government to implement an alternative election procedure, the New Mexico supreme court denied petitioners' and respondent's requested relief because the Election Code does not permit the secretary of state to mail absentee ballots directly to voters without a prior request from the voter, but the supreme court issued its writ of mandamus to compel the secretary of state to mail absentee ballot applications to every eligible voter in New Mexico, because the secretary of state had an affirmative duty to conduct elections in full compliance with the Election Code, which requires that all statewide primary and general elections offer both in-person voting and absentee voting options, and an affirmative duty to comply with all pandemic-related executive and public health orders, which required the secretary of state to take all lawful steps to minimize the spread of COVID-19. As the chief election officer of the state, respondent had a duty to manage the election in a manner that minimized the risk of spreading COVID-19 and in a manner that protected lives by helping voters stay home as much as possible.State ex rel. Riddle v. Toulouse Oliver, 2021-NMSC-018.\n\nOriginal proceeding in mandamus.— A mandamus petition for an order precluding the governor from implementing compacts and revenue-sharing agreements with Indian tribes which would permit gaming on Indian lands pursuant to the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was properly brought before the supreme court in an original proceeding.State ex rel.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nMandamus involving a suit pending in another court.— A district court is not uniformly required to deny a petition for mandamus out of deference to a suit that is pending before another district court. Rather, the district court, in exercising its discretion, should take into account the similarities of parties and issues and consider whether the district court first having jurisdiction over the matter is properly situated to settle the whole controversy and address the rights of the respective parties.Fastbucks of Roswell, N.M., LLC v. King, 2013-NMCA-008, 294 P.3d 1287.\n\nWhere the attorney general filed suit against defendants in the first district court alleging that defendants' lending practices and consumer loans were unconscionable under common law and the Unfair Practices Act, Section 57-12-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.; defendants filed a petition for writ of mandamus against the attorney general in the fifth district court to prohibit the attorney general from pursuing the first district court lawsuit on the grounds that defendants' loans complied with the Small Loan Act, Sections 58-15-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., and that the attorney general was acting beyond the attorney general's statutory and constitutional power in bringing the first district court lawsuit; the fifth district court had jurisdiction to consider the mandamus petition and venue was proper in the fifth district court; defendants had the opportunity to raise the arguments raised in the mandamus petition in their defense to the first district court lawsuit; and the fifth district court dismissed the mandamus petition on the grounds that the writ of mandamus would intrude on the first district court's jurisdiction and that the first district court provided an adequate forum for defendants to raise their challenges to the attorney general's powers, the fifth district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for mandamus.Fastbucks of Roswell, N.M., LLC v. King, 2013-NMCA-008, 294 P.3d 1287.\n\nWrit enforces only clear legal rights.— It is a well-established doctrine in the law relating to mandamus that only clear legal rights are subject to enforcement by the writ.Schreiber v. Baca, 1954-NMSC-110, 58 N.M. 766, 276 P.2d 902.\n\nAct beyond power or dependent on nonparty's will not required.— The writ of mandamus will not require the performance of an act beyond the power of the respondent or dependent upon the will of a third person not a party to the suit.Territory ex rel. Lester v. Suddith, 1910-NMSC-068, 15 N.M. 728, 110 P. 1038.\n\nNot issued when no reason to suppose noncompliance with order.— Where the warden who was sought to be compelled by writ had not appealed and there was no claim that he was not bound by the trial court's decision, the supreme court had no reason to suppose that he would not comply with it, and declined to assume he would not, and thus, defendant had suffered no prejudice by the trial court's denial of the writ, nor was prejudice to him presently threatened.Apodaca v. Rodriguez, 1972-NMSC-067, 84 N.M. 338, 503 P.2d 318.\n\nWill issue if governor exceeds constitutional authority.— The exercise of the veto power requires judgment and discretion on the part of the governor and he cannot be compelled by the legislature or by this court to exercise this power or to exercise it in a particular manner. However, the manner in which the governor exercises the power is not beyond judicial review or judicial control. When the manner in which it is exercised is beyond the governor's constitutional authority, mandamus is a proper proceeding in which to question not only the constitutionality of legislative enactments, but also the constitutionality of vetoes or attempted vetoes by the governor.State ex rel. Sego v. Kirkpatrick, 1974-NMSC-059, 86 N.M. 359, 524 P.2d 975.\n\nWhen administrative board exceeds its jurisdiction.— Generally mandamus will not lie to control the discretion of an administrative board. But an exception to the general rule is recognized where the administrative board has acted unlawfully or wholly outside its jurisdiction or authority, or where it had abused its discretion.Sanderson v. N.M. State Racing Comm'n, 1969-NMSC-031, 80 N.M. 200, 453 P.2d 370.\n\nDenomination of pleading irrelevant since allegations and relief determine nature.— It matters not what the pleading initiating the proceeding may be denominated. If in truth it discloses by its allegations and the relief sought that it is an action in mandamus, it will be so treated.Laumbach v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1955-NMSC-096, 60 N.M. 226, 290 P.2d 1067.\n\nIf prohibition does not lie on facts then neither does mandamus.— Relator sought by writ of prohibition to restrain the district judge from granting a new trial in a workmen's compensation action on grounds of lack of jurisdiction under the act, and a motion to dismiss was sustained, under the same facts where prohibition will not lie, mandamus will not lie.State ex rel. Gallegos v. MacPherson, 1957-NMSC-068, 63 N.M. 133, 314 P.2d 891.\n\nIf no jurisdictional question or injustice then writ not issued.— Where there was no jurisdictional question presented nor any showing that grave injustice would result if the case proceeded to trial, the matter was not one calling for the writ; and as the alternative writ of prohibition had been improvidently issued, it was thereby discharged.Baca v. Burks,1970-NMSC-055, 81 N.M. 376, 467 P.2d 392.\n\nPro se petitions.— Pro se petitions are regarded with a tolerant eye. Courts will consider a petition if the essential elements prerequisite to the granting of the relief sought can be found or reasonably inferred.Martinez v. State, 1990-NMCA-033, 110 N.M. 357, 796 P.2d 250.\n\nII. PURPOSE OF SECTION.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nMandamus is a summary and specific remedy to enforce performanceof a duty incident to an existing right, in cases in which, without such appropriate redress, serious injustice would occur. It is a recognized process to maintain the prima facie title to an office, and it is not within its purview to determine the legality of such claim.Conklin v. Cunningham, 1894-NMSC-005, 7 N.M. 445, 38 P. 170.\n\nFor mandamus to lie there must be clear legal rightsought to be enforced, and where college professor's claimed tenure was not as a result of a positive provision of law, no such clear legal right existed.Lease v. Board of Regents, 1972-NMSC-042, 83 N.M. 781, 498 P.2d 310.\n\nPurpose of mandamus is to compel performance of ministerial dutywhich one charged with its performance has refused to perform.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1962-NMSC-030, 71 N.M. 194, 376 P.2d 976.\n\nRights may not be adjudicated between parties by mandamus.— It is only a method of enforcing an existing right.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Quesenberry, 1963-NMSC-113, 72 N.M. 291, 383 P.2d 255.\n\nWrit only lies where duty clear and indisputable.— Mandamus lies to compel the performance of a statutory duty only when it is clear and indisputable.Regents of Agric. Coll. v. Vaughn, 1904-NMSC-023, 12 N.M. 333, 78 P. 51.\n\nMandamus lies at request of person beneficially interested to compelthe performance of an affirmative act by another where the duty to perform the act is clearly enjoined by law and where there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.El Dorado at Santa Fe, Inc. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1976-NMSC-029, 89 N.M. 313, 551 P.2d 1360.\n\nWrit may be used to question constitutionality.— Mandamus may not be used to control judicial discretion, but in the proper case, mandamus may be used to question the constitutionality of a state statute.Montoya v. Blackhurst, 1972-NMSC-058, 84 N.M. 91, 500 P.2d 176.\n\nMandamus affords proper remedy against ex official by de facto officerhaving prima facie right to obtain possession of the books, papers and other property of the office, and a pretended retention of the office by the late occupant will not justify him in withholding such property, with a view to compel resort to information in the nature of quo warranto by a party possessing the prima facie title.Conklin v. Cunningham, 1894-NMSC-005, 7 N.M. 445, 38 P. 170.\n\nMandamus affords proper remedy to compel public body to act.— When any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person fails to perform its duties, the affected parties may apply to the district court for a writ of mandamus to compel the public body to discharge any of its functions.City of Albuquerque v. AFSCME, 2015-NMCA-023.\n\nWhere labor management relations board, for eighteen months, was not functioning to resolve employee complaints because the board was missing one of its required three members, writ of mandamus was a remedy available to compel the board to discharge its duties.City of Albuquerque v. AFSCME, 2015-NMCA-023.\n\nOne who has prima facie title to office may compeldelivery to himself of the property and paraphernalia of the office by mandamus; the question of actual or ultimate title to the office must be reserved for another proceeding.Eldodt v. Territory ex rel. Vaughn, 1900-NMSC-015, 10 N.M. 141, 61 P. 105.\n\nB. JUDICIAL ACTS.\n\nMandamus is proper remedy to compel district court to take actionor perform duties as required by legislative enactments.State ex rel. Maloney v. Neal, 1969-NMSC-095, 80 N.M. 460, 457 P.2d 708.\n\nProhibatory mandamus.— Mandamus is a proper remedy by which to prohibit a public official from acting unlawfully or unconstitutionally.State ex rel. Clark v. Johnson, 1995-NMSC-048, 120 N.M. 562, 904 P.2d 11;State ex rel. Taylor v. Johnson, 1998-NMSC-015, 125 N.M. 343, 961 P.2d 768.\n\nSimple ministerial task of setting case down for jury trialis an act which may be compelled by writ of mandamus.State ex rel. Cardenas v. Swope, 1954-NMSC-028, 58 N.M. 296, 270 P.2d 708.\n\nRemedy for erroneous refusal of appeal or supersedeas is mandamusand not by writ of error.Albright v. Territory ex rel. Sandoval, 1905-NMSC-010, 13 N.M. 64, 79 P. 719, appeal dismissed, 200 U.S. 9, 26 S. Ct. 210, 50 L. Ed. 346 (1906);Gutierrez v. Territory ex rel. Curran, 1905-NMSC-005, 13 N.M. 30, 79 P. 299,appeal dismissed, 202 U.S. 614, 26 S. Ct. 766, 50 L. Ed. 1171 (1906).\n\nWrit lies to compel fixing amount of supersedeas bond.— Mandamus will be granted to command the trial court to fix the amount of the supersedeas bond, where an order and judgment granting a mandatory injunction have been appealed.State ex rel. Martinez v. Holloman, 1918-NMSC-138, 25 N.M. 117, 177 P. 741.\n\nC. ACTS BY PUBLIC OFFICIALS.\n\nMandamus is proper remedy to compel performance of official actby a public officer.City of Santa Rosa v. Jaramillo, 1973-NMSC-119, 85 N.M. 747, 517 P.2d 69.\n\nGovernor's duty under primary election law to issue proclamation was mandatoryand mandamus was properly granted to compel the governor to specify in his proclamation the boundaries of the district making up the office of county commissioner and terms of that office.State ex rel. Robinson v. King, 1974-NMSC-028, 86 N.M. 231, 522 P.2d 83.\n\nWrit lies to contest failure to certify nominees.— Mandamus is a proper action to contest the validity of the secretary of state's action in failing to certify a party's nominees.State ex rel. Chavez v. Evans, 1968-NMSC-167, 79 N.M. 578, 446 P.2d 445.\n\nMandamus compelling payment serves function of writ of execution.— Mandamus is one of the remedies and often the only one available to compel a governmental body to pay a money judgment. Mandamus issued to enforce payment of a money judgment against a governmental agency is only ancillary to and in aid of the judgment, and serves the same purpose as a writ of execution.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Quesenberry, 1963-NMSC-113, 72 N.M. 291, 383 P.2d 255.\n\nWrit lies where board has duty and mistakes its power.— Where appeal has been taken from the granting of an alternative writ of mandamus, and the answer shows that the respondent had failed to perform a clear legal duty, and was mistaken as to its power, and that it erroneously alleged that relator had other legal remedy, this court will not interfere, and a peremptory writ will issue.State ex rel. Thompson v. Beall, 1932-NMSC-082, 37 N.M. 72, 18 P.2d 249.\n\nAnother's license not revoked for commercial advantages.— Commercial advantages, which the holder of a retail liquor license might gain by elimination of competition of another holder of a license, were too illusive and uncertain to entitle it to maintain mandamus proceedings, as a person enforcing special interest or private right, to compel revocation of the license of another.Ruidoso State Bank v. Brumlow, 1970-NMSC-042, 81 N.M. 379, 467 P.2d 395,overruled on other grounds byDe Vargas Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Campbell, 1975-NMSC-026, 87 N.M. 469, 535 P.2d 1320.\n\nMandamus lies to compel board of county commissioners to performa duty required by statute.Codlin v. Kohlhousen, 1899-NMSC-008, 9 N.M. 565, 58 P. 499, appeal dismissed, 181 U.S. 151, 21 S. Ct. 584, 45 L. Ed. 793 (1901).\n\nTo compel canvass of votes.— A board of canvassers may be compelled by mandamus to canvass votes, and to direct how they shall be returned and in whose favor an election certificate shall be issued.In re Sloan, 1891-NMSC-011, 5 N.M. 590, 25 P. 930;Territory ex rel. Lewis v. Board of County Comm'rs, 1888-NMSC-015, 5 N.M. 1, 16 P. 855.\n\nTo compel tax levy.— A writ of mandamus is properly directed to the mayor and city council to compel a tax levy.Territory ex rel. Parker v. Mayor of Socorro, 1904-NMSC-012, 12 N.M. 177, 76 P. 283.\n\nWrit remedy to teacher for refusal to rehire.— A teacher's remedy for refusal of the local school board to give her a hearing and a statement of reasons for its refusal to rehire her was to pursue mandamus. The jurisdiction of the state board is limited to review of decisions of the local school board made after an informal hearing, and the jurisdiction of the court of appeals is limited to review of decisions of the state board.Bertrand v. N.M. State Bd. of Educ., 1975-NMCA-145, 88 N.M. 611, 544 P.2d 1176, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70 (1976).\n\nTo compel grievance proceeding under city merit system.— City may be compelled to hold a grievance proceeding under a city merit system, where there was evidence that the city officials had failed in their duty to provide a required remedy, and, the alternative, a suit in contract, would not have been plain, speedy, or adequate.Lovato v. City of Albuquerque, 1987-NMSC-086, 106 N.M. 287, 742 P.2d 499.\n\nWrit cannot make collateral attack on judgment.— Where judgments have been rendered against a county on certain of its bonds, attack may not be made on their validity by mandamus to compel payment.Territory ex rel. Coler v. Board of County Comm'rs, 1907-NMSC-018, 14 N.M. 134, 89 P. 252,aff'd, 215 U.S. 296, 30 S. Ct. 111, 54 L. Ed. 202 (1909).\n\nIII. TYPE OF DUTY.\n\nA. MINISTERIAL.\n\nWrit does not lie unless specially enjoined upon warden.— Plaintiff could not prevail in petition for writ of mandamus where the act sought to be compelled was not one specially enjoined by law upon the warden.Apodaca v. Rodriguez, 1972-NMSC-067, 84 N.M. 338, 503 P.2d 318.\n\nAct to be compelled by mandamus must be ministerial,that is, an act or thing which the public official is required to perform by direction of law upon a given state of facts being shown to exist, regardless of his own opinion as to the propriety or impropriety of doing the act in the particular case.El Dorado at Santa Fe, Inc. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1976-NMSC-029, 89 N.M. 313, 551 P.2d 1360.\n\nA ministerial act, as applied to a public officer,is an act or thing which he is required to perform by direction of law upon a given state of facts being shown to exist, regardless of his own opinion as to the propriety or impropriety of doing the act in the particular case.Sender v. Montoya, 1963-NMSC-220, 73 N.M. 287, 387 P.2d 860;State ex rel. Reynolds v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1962-NMSC-030, 71 N.M. 194, 376 P.2d 976.\n\nWrit lies to compel acts committed to official's discretion.— Acts and the duties under them are no less ministerial because the public official, upon whom the duty is enjoined, may have to satisfy himself as to the existence of facts necessary to require his action. Where he refuses to act after such a determination is made, mandamus is the proper remedy, and where he refuses or delays, mandamus will issue to compel acts committed to his discretion if the law requires him to act one way or another.El Dorado at Santa Fe, Inc. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1976-NMSC-029, 89 N.M. 313, 551 P.2d 1360.\n\nTo compel particular act upon shown facts.— While mandamus will not lie to correct or control the judgment or discretion of a public officer in matters committed to his care in the ordinary discharge of his duties, it will lie to compel the performance of mere ministerial acts or duties imposed by law upon a public officer to do a particular act or thing upon the existence of certain facts or conditions being shown, even though the officer be required to exercise judgment before acting.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1962-NMSC-030, 71 N.M. 194, 376 P.2d 976.\n\nMandamus lies to compel judicial officer or court to performan act or duty which is ministerial and does not include the exercise of discretion. Likewise, it will lie to require a court to perform its judicial duties, but not to do so in any particular way.State ex rel. Maloney v. Neal, 1969-NMSC-099, 80 N.M. 460, 457 P.2d 708.\n\nDischarge hearings under the School Personnel Act are mandatory unless prejudicial.— Where petitioner filed a request for a discharge hearing, pursuant to 22-10A-27(B) NMSA 1978, two days after the five-day time limit had passed after receiving notice of the Santa Fe Public schools' intent to discharge him from his teaching and coaching positions, mandamus was proper where respondent had a duty to hold a discharge hearing, where respondent had not been prejudiced by the late request for hearing, and where petitioner had no other adequate, speedy remedy at law.Nat'l Educ. Ass'n of N.M. v. Santa Fe Pub. Sch., 2016-NMCA-009.\n\nCounty commissioners' duties as to subdivisions formerly only ministerial.— Before the passage of the 1973 New Mexico Subdivision Act (47-5-9, 47-6-1 to 47-6-29 NMSA 1978), a board of county commissioners had nothing to do but the ministerial act of endorsing its approval on plats which complied with all statutory requirements for rural subdivisions, and mandamus was a proper remedy when it refused to do so.El Dorado at Santa Fe, Inc. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1976-NMSC-029, 89 N.M. 313, 551 P.2d 1360.\n\nB. DISCRETIONARY.\n\nMandamus will not direct performance of particular actfrom among two or more allowed alternatives.El Dorado at Santa Fe, Inc. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1976-NMSC-029, 89 N.M. 313, 551 P.2d 1360.\n\nDiscretion in performing an act ariseswhen it may be performed in one of two or more ways, either of which would be lawful, and where it is left to the will or judgment of the performer to determine in which way it should be performed, but when a positive duty is enjoined and there is but one way in which it can be performed lawfully, then there is no discretion.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1962-NMSC-030, 71 N.M. 194, 376 P.2d 976.\n\nWhere discretion is as to existence of facts entitling relatorto the thing demanded, if facts are clearly proved or admitted, mandamus will lie to compel action according to law, for in such case the act to be done becomes purely ministerial and the duty to perform is absolute.City of Santa Rosa v. Jaramillo, 1973-NMSC-119, 85 N.M. 747, 517 P.2d 69.\n\nWrit lies to compel act even if exercising judgment required.— While mandamus will not lie to correct or control the judgment or discretion of a public officer in matters committed to his care in the ordinary discharge of his duties, it is nevertheless well established that mandamus will lie to compel the performance of mere ministerial acts or duties imposed by law upon a public officer to do a particular act or thing upon the existence of certain facts or conditions being shown, even though the officer be required to exercise judgment before acting.Sender v. Montoya, 1963-NMSC-220, 73 N.M. 287, 387 P.2d 860.\n\nMandamus is not available to control judicial discretionunless there is a clear abuse of that discretion, or unless such action would prevent the doing of useless things.State ex rel. Peters v. McIntosh, 1969-NMSC-103, 80 N.M. 496, 458 P.2d 222.\n\nMandamus not available to limit prosecutorial discretion.— Although a prosecutor is required to present direct exculpatory evidence to the grand jury, he is invested with wide discretion as to the selection and presentation of evidence. Mandamus will not lie where the effect of its issuance would be to improperly limit the scope of the state's prosecutorial discretion.Kerpan v. Sandoval Cnty. Dist. Att'ys Office, 1988-NMCA-007, 106 N.M. 764, 750 P.2d 464.\n\nWhere officials have discretion, no clear legal duty exists.— Mandamus is a remedy for the violation of a clear legal duty, and where no such legal duty is required, as where village officials may exercise discretion, it follows that it would be improvident to issue the writ.State ex rel. Sun Co. v. Vigil, 1965-NMSC-012, 74 N.M. 766, 398 P.2d 987.\n\nNo basis for writ if official has discretion.— Under former Section 42-1-23 NMSA 1978, if the state highway commission (now state transportation commission) has a clear legal duty to sell to the property owner, the writ of mandamus may compel the discharge of the duty, but if there is discretion to sell, rather than a clear legal duty to do so, there is no basis for the writ.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Clark, 1968-NMSC-057, 79 N.M. 29, 439 P.2d 547.\n\nMandamus is appropriate only when that duty is clear and indisputable.— Mandamus lies to compel the performance of an affirmative act by another where the duty to perform the act is clearly enjoined by law and where there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law; mandamus does not apply to compel an executive officer acting within his or her discretion.State ex rel. Stapleton v. Skandera, 2015-NMCA-044.\n\nWhere the secretary of the public education department implemented new regulations governing the evaluation of teachers in public schools, and where 22-10A-19 NMSA 1978 requires the public education department to adopt criteria and minimum highly objective uniform statewide standards of evaluation for the annual performance evaluation of licensed school employees, the secretary was acting within her statutory authority and exercising her discretion under the statute as long as the teacher evaluation program was objective and uniform; the district court did not err in denying the petition for a writ of mandamus.State ex rel. Stapleton v. Skandera, 2015-NMCA-044.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Civil Procedure - Dismissal and Nonsuit - Mandamus,\" see 4 Nat.

It shall issue on the information of the party beneficially interested.\n\nHistory:Laws 1884, ch. 1, § 39; C.L. 1884, § 1994; C.L. 1897, § 2762; Code 1915, § 3414; C.S. 1929, § 86-104; 1941 Comp., § 26-105; 1953 Comp., § 22-12-5.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nMandamus can only be resorted to when other remedies fail.State ex rel. Sweeney v. Second Judicial Dist. Court, 1912-NMSC-033, 17 N.M. 282, 127 P. 23.\n\nMunicipality without right to appeal may enforce rights by mandamus.— When a municipality is not given a right to appeal and thus has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law to enforce its rights to protect the health, safety, welfare and morals of its residents, these rights may be enforced by mandamus.City of Santa Rosa v. Jaramillo, 1973-NMSC-119, 85 N.M. 747, 517 P.2d 69.\n\nWhere remedy at law exists writ will not lie.— As respondents had a plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law from the order denying their motion to quash the writs of garnishment, to wit, an appeal by trial de novo therefrom to the district court, mandamus did not lie to correct the claimed error by respondent, if in fact error was committed.Alfred v. Anderson, 1974-NMSC-036, 86 N.M. 227, 522 P.2d 79.\n\nWrit lies if no remedy in ordinary course of law.— Refusal of state corporation commission (now public regulation commission) to draw a voucher for the salary of an employee of the commission entitles him to resort to the remedy of mandamus, as the ordinary course of law does not afford a plain, speedy and adequate remedy.State ex rel. Stephens v. SCC, 1918-NMSC-125, 25 N.M. 32, 176 P. 866.\n\nWrit may be maintained if plain ministerial duty required.— Where a teacher, by positive provision of law, has a fixed tenure of office, or can be removed only in a certain prescribed manner, and where consequently it is the plain ministerial duty to retain him, mandamus can be maintained. Mandamus is not an available remedy for enforcement of contract rights because there is another adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law, in the form of an action for damages.State ex rel. Sittler v. Board of Educ., 1913-NMSC-062, 18 N.M. 183, 135 P. 96.\n\nThe district court's directive exceeded the proper bounds of mandamus.— In consolidated appeals where the chief medical investigator of the office of the medical investigator (OMI) appealed the district court's grant of a writ of mandamus directing the OMI to amend its manner of death determination on a death certificate for decedent, the issuance of the mandamus order in this case directing the OMI to change its medical opinion as to manner of death was error, because although § 24-14-20 NMSA 1978, and the OMI's own regulations impose a mandatory duty to refer deaths that occur without medical attendance to OMI, which must then conduct an investigation to determine and certify the cause of death, the mandamus order in this case went beyond directing the OMI to fulfill the ministerial duties of investigating, determining, and certifying the cause and manner of death and ordered the OMI to change its medical opinion of the manner of death from \"suicide\" to \"undetermined.\" The OMI's determination as to the manner of death is a discretionary determination, in which mandamus cannot be used to direct a specific outcome.Wallbro v. Nolte, 2022-NMCA-027, cert. granted.\n\nWrit can compel canvass of election returns.— Under this section, an information was properly filed as the basis of proceeding for writ of mandamus to compel board of county commissioners to canvass election returns.Territory ex rel. Lewis v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1888-NMSC-015, 5 N.M. (Gild., E.W.S. ed.) 1, 16 P. 855.\n\nAlternative writ and answer only pleadings considered.— The only pleadings to be considered on a petition for the writ are the alternative writ and the answer thereto.Schreiber v. Baca, 1954-NMSC-110, 58 N.M. 766, 276 P.2d 902.\n\nThe petition for the writ becomes functus officio when granted.Schreiber v. Baca, 1954-NMSC-110, 58 N.M. 766, 276 P.2d 902.\n\nII. PLAIN AND ADEQUATE.\n\nWrit cannot lie where adequate law or appeal remedy exists.— Mandamus will not lie where there exists a plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law; nor will it lie where there is an adequate remedy by appeal.Montoya v. Blackhurst, 1972-NMSC-058, 84 N.M. 91, 500 P.2d 176.\n\nWrit will not lie to enforce contract where adequate remedy exists.— Mandamus will not issue to enforce a contract, even though a legally enforceable contract exists, if there is an adequate remedy at law.Shepard v. Board of Educ., 1970-NMSC-067, 81 N.M. 585, 470 P.2d 306.\n\nWrit cannot lie until administrative remedies exhausted.— Mandamus is a proper remedy only after a petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies.Shepard v. Board of Educ., 1970-NMSC-067, 81 N.M. 585, 470 P.2d 306.\n\nInadequacy not absence determines propriety of writ.— It is the inadequacy, and not the mere absence, of all other legal remedies, and the danger of a failure of justice without it, that must usually determine the propriety of a writ of mandamus; and it is not excluded by other remedies, which are not adequate to secure the specific relief needed, nor by the existence of a specific remedy in equity.Conklin v. Cunningham, 1894-NMSC-005, 7 N.M. 445, 38 P. 170.\n\nWrit where alternative remedy insufficient.— City may be compelled to hold a grievance proceeding under a city merit system, where there was evidence that the city officials had failed in their duty to provide a required remedy, and, the alternative, a suit in contract, would not have been plain, speedy, or adequate.Lovato v. City of Albuquerque, 1987-NMSC-086, 106 N.M. 287, 742 P.2d 499.\n\nWrit lies where appeal process has proven inadequate and has caused prejudice.— Where the director of the labor relations division of the New Mexico department of workforce solutions (director) failed to comply with the Public Works Minimum Wage Act, §§ 13-4-10 to -17 NMSA 1978, which requires the director to set prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates according to applicable collective bargaining agreements for certain public works projects, mandamus was proper when the avenue for appeal provided for in the Public Works Minimum Wage Act was inadequate considering that, over several years, several appeals taken from several department of workforce solutions regulatory actions failed to result in the setting of new rates in accordance with applicable collective bargaining agreements.N.M. Bldg. and Constr. Trades Council v. Dean, 2015-NMSC-023.\n\nMandamus proper where discharged teacher made an untimely request for a discharge hearing.— Where petitioner filed a request for a discharge hearing, pursuant to 22-10A-27(B) NMSA 1978, two days after the five-day time limit had passed after receiving notice of the Santa Fe public schools' intent to discharge him from his teaching and coaching positions, mandamus was proper where respondent had a duty to hold a discharge hearing, where respondent had not been prejudiced by the late request for hearing, and where petitioner had no other adequate, speedy remedy at law.Nat'l Educ. Ass'n of N.M. v. Santa Fe Pub. Sch., 2016-NMCA-009.\n\nDeclaratory judgment not intended as substitute for mandamus.— Declaratory judgment actions are not intended to provide a substitute for other available actions, such as mandamus. A mandamus will not be denied on the ground that the plaintiff did not bring a declaratory judgment action.City of Albuquerque v. Ryon, 1987-NMSC-121, 106 N.M. 600, 747 P.2d 246.\n\nMandamus will not lie where adequate remedy by appeal,or writ of error exists.State ex rel. Sweeney v. Second Judicial Dist., 1912-NMSC-033, 17 N.M. 282, 127 P. 23.\n\nMandamus was proper remedy to prohibit unconstitutional official action.— Where petitioners, a class of public officers affected by the election deferral provisions of HB 407, passed by the 2019 legislature, filed petitions for writs of mandamus challenging the constitutionality of HB 407 to the extent it postponed the times of election and extended the constitutionally mandated terms of certain public offices, prohibitory mandamus was an appropriate means of addressing the constitutional claims because the electoral timing and term of office provisions of HB 407 presented issues of public importance which implicated citizens' fundamental right to vote.State ex rel. Sugg v. Toulouse Oliver, 2020-NMSC-002.\n\nUnconstitutional alteration to the terms of office.— Where petitioners, a class of public officers affected by the election deferral provisions of HB 407, passed by the 2019 legislature, filed petitions for writs of mandamus challenging the constitutionality of HB 407 to the extent it postponed the times of election and extended the constitutionally mandated terms of certain public offices, the New Mexico supreme court issued writs of mandamus prohibiting the implementation of the affected provisions because they impermissibly alter the constitutionally prescribed terms of office of the petitioning groups.State ex rel. Sugg v. Toulouse Oliver, 2020-NMSC-002.\n\nAppeal must also be taken from administrative decisions.— Mandamus will not lie when the relator has failed to pursue a statutory right to appeal to district court from an administrative decision.Birdo v. Rodriguez, 1972-NMSC-062, 84 N.M. 207, 501 P.2d 195.\n\nErroneous sentence must also be appealed.— Where defendant received erroneous sentence upon conviction of forgery, but failed to exercise right of appeal, mandamus would not lie to compel parole board to treat his sentence as if correct.State Bd. of Parole v. Lane, 1957-NMSC-067, 63 N.M. 105, 314 P.2d 602.\n\nCannot compel signing bill of exception after appeal's return date.— Mandamus will not lie to compel a district judge to sign and settle a bill of exceptions not tendered until after the return day of appeal.State ex rel. Divelbiss v. Raynolds, 1913-NMSC-028, 17 N.M. 662, 132 P. 249.\n\nLiquor license applicant's remedy after division's final decision was appeal.— Where a letter from division of liquor control clearly shows that the application had been considered and in fact that the application cannot be processed because the quota of one license to each 2000 people has been more than filled in Rio Arriba county, there can be no doubt this amounted to a final decision on division's part to refuse the application. A decision is a determination arrived at after consideration, an opinion formed, or a course of action decided upon. The applicant's remedy upon being advised of the decision was by appeal to the district court of Santa Fe County as expressly provided by former Section 46-5-16, 1953 Comp. It follows that the district court erred in entering its judgment ordering the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandamus.Armijo v. Armijo, 1967-NMSC-102, 77 N.M. 742, 427 P.2d 258.\n\nTeacher's failure to follow statutory remedy negatived his rightto proceed by mandamus.Sanchez v. Board of Educ., 1961-NMSC-081, 68 N.M. 440, 362 P.2d 979.\n\nAdequate law remedy exists to redress public lands commissioner's acts.— Section 19-7-67 NMSA 1978 provides an adequate remedy at law for anyone who is aggrieved by the action of the commissioner of public lands and therefore, mandamus does not lie to compel the duties alleged to be due.Andrews v. Walker, 1955-NMSC-072, 60 N.M. 69, 287 P.2d 423.\n\nWrit lies to enforce provisions of judgment in condemnation proceeding.— Rule that mandamus will not issue to enforce contract rights \"because there is another adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, in the form of an action for damages\" was not applicable when property owner sought mandamus to enforce provisions of a judgment in a condemnation proceeding because money damages were not an adequate remedy in actions for specific performance of land sales contract; and \"there can be no monetary substitute for the precise land bargained for.\"State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Clark, 1968-NMSC-057, 79 N.M. 29, 439 P.2d 547.\n\nAdministrative duties must be exhausted.— Mandamus does not lie when the relator has failed to exhaust an adequate administrative remedy provided by statute.Birdo v. Rodriguez, 1972-NMSC-062, 84 N.M. 207, 501 P.2d 195.\n\nWrit cannot lie where administrative remedies unexhausted and pleadings deficient.— Where the pleading was patently deficient and where there was a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiff's mandamus claim sua sponte and without appointment of counsel.Orrs v. Rodriguez, 1972-NMCA-148, 84 N.M. 355, 503 P.2d 335.\n\nIII. SPEEDY.\n\nWrit lies where early constitutionality decision of importance.— Mandamus was a proper remedy by which the petitioner could attack the constitutionality of statute in view of the possible inadequacy of other remedies and the necessity of an early decision on question of great public importance.Thompson v. Legislative Audit Comm'n, 1968-NMSC-184, 79 N.M. 693, 448 P.2d 799.\n\nMandamus will lie to determine proper place of trial, before trial,where great delay and expense would result from pursuing an appeal and where a change in venue was made without authority.State ex rel. Cardenas v. Swope, 1954-NMSC-028, 58 N.M. 296, 270 P.2d 708.\n\nMandamus lies where combination of facets of litigation cause delay.— The ordinary delays attendant to a somewhat involved trial would not of itself justify mandamus nor would the fact that the petitioner does not have the benefit of a replevin bond although this is a circumstance which must be considered in connection with the delays of a trial and subsequent appeal. It is more the combination of all the various facets of the litigation which makes it apparent that to refuse the writ \"would result in needless expense and delay\" and therefore the ordinary remedy by appeal is inadequate here.Sender v. Montoya, 1963-NMSC-220, 73 N.M. 287, 387 P.2d 860.\n\nIV. BENEFICIALLY INTERESTED.\n\nMandamus lies at request of person beneficially interested to compelthe performance of an affirmative act by another where the duty to perform the act is clearly enjoined by law and where there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.El Dorado at Santa Fe, Inc. v. Board of County Comm'rs, 1976-NMSC-029, 89 N.M. 313, 551 P.2d 1360.\n\nStanding of private parties to obtain writ to vindicate public interest.— Even though a private party may not have standing to invoke the power of the supreme court to resolve constitutional questions and enforce constitutional compliance, the supreme court, in its discretion, may grant standing to private parties to obtain a writ of mandamus to vindicate the public interest in cases presenting issues of great public importance.State ex rel. Sego v. Kirkpatrick, 1974-NMSC-059, 86 N.M. 359, 524 P.2d 975;State ex rel. Johnson, 1995-NMSC-048, 120 N.M. 562, 904 P.2d 11.\n\nWhere a city mayor initiated a mandamus action in the mayor's official and individual capacity to prohibit the enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional statute that permitted local governments to regulate some aspects of the right to bear arms and during the pendency of the proceeding, the former mayor was succeeded by a new mayor who sought to dismiss the action, the Supreme Court conferred standing on the former mayor to maintain the mandamus action in the former mayor's individual capacity due to the importance of the issues involved.Baca v. N.M. Dep't of Public Safety, 2002-NMSC-017, 132 N.M. 282, 47 P.3d 441.\n\nCity is \"beneficially interested\" in suit to compel its treasurerto deposit the money in his hands belonging to it in a bank designated by ordinance, from which it would receive interest.Territory ex rel. City of Albuquerque v. Matson, 1911-NMSC-016, 16 N.M. 135, 113 P. 816.\n\nPlaintiff not \"beneficially interested\".— Where plaintiffs, in an action attacking the legality of legislation authorizing Indian gaming in New Mexico (11-13-1 and 11-13-2 NMSA 1978), asserted only an abstract right owed to the people of the state as a whole, they were not \"beneficially interested\" parties under this section.State ex rel. Coll v. Johnson, 1999-NMSC-036, 128 N.M. 154, 990 P.2d 1277.\n\nCitizen may apply to enforce performance of public duty.— As a general rule, mandamus may issue to enforce the performance of a public duty by public officers not due to the government itself as such, upon application of any citizen whose rights are affected in common with those of the general public.State ex rel. Burg v. City of Albuquerque, 1926-NMSC-031, 31 N.M. 576, 249 P. 242.\n\nTaxpayer has no standing to enforce duty owed to public.— The University of New Mexico is a creature of the N.M. Const., art. XII, §§ 12, 13, augmented by Sections 21-7-1 to 21-7-3 NMSA 1978, and the respondents owe their duties to the state of New Mexico, not to a private person. This being so, it follows that relator, though a taxpayer, has no standing to enforce by mandamus a duty owing to the public.Womack v. Regents of Univ. of N.M., 1971-NMSC-043, 82 N.M. 460, 483 P.2d 934.\n\nState and not parents of victim interested in murder prosecution.— Discretion of appointed or elected public officials charged with criminal prosecution cannot be controlled by mandamus proceedings in murder prosecution since it is the state rather than parents of child who was killed which is the party beneficially interested in the prosecution.State ex rel. Naramore v. Hensley, 1949-NMSC-039, 53 N.M. 308, 207 P.2d 529.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment on Sender v. Montoya, 73 N.M. 287, 387 P.2d 860 (1963), see 4 Nat.

The alternative writ shall state concisely the facts showing the obligation of the defendant to perform the act, and his omission to perform it, and command him, that immediately after the receipt of the writ, or at some other specified time, he do the act required to be performed, or show cause before the court out of which the writ issued, at a specified time and place, why he has not done so; and that he then and there return the writ with his certificate of having done as he is commanded. The peremptory writ shall be in a similar form, except that the words requiring the defendant to show cause why he has not done as commanded, shall be omitted.\n\nHistory:Laws 1884, ch. 1, § 40; C.L. 1884, § 1995; C.L. 1897, § 2763; Code 1915, § 3415; C.S. 1929, § 86-105; 1941 Comp., § 26-106; 1953 Comp., § 22-12-6.\n\nCross references.— For writ and answer being only pleading allowed in mandamus proceeding,see44-2-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nContents of the permanent writ.— No rule requires a permanent writ that follows an alternative writ to contain the recitation of facts required in Section 44-2-6 NMSA 1978. Where a party has made a full scale response to the issuance of a writ it cannot successfully attack the permanent writ for legal insufficiency.Os Farms, Inc. v. N.M. Am. Water Co., Inc., 2009-NMCA-113, 147 N.M. 221, 218 P.3d 1269.\n\nContents of the peremptory writ.— The peremptory writ failed to state a claim for relief when it contained only bare legal conclusions and alleged no facts supporting a ministerial duty.Brantley Farms v. Carlsbad Irrigation Dist., 1998-NMCA-023, 124 N.M. 698, 954 P.2d 763.\n\nFacts pleaded in same manner as in ordinary actions.— Allegations of fact in mandamus proceedings should be pleaded with the same certainty, no more and no less, as in ordinary actions.State ex rel. Burg v. City of Albuquerque, 1926-NMSC-031, 31 N.M. 576, 249 P. 242.\n\nAllegations of fact in application form no part of writ.— Allegations of fact in an application for alternative writ of mandamus form no part of the writ and ordinarily cannot be so considered in determining the legal sufficiency of the writ.Mora County Bd. of Educ. v. Valdez, 1956-NMSC-078, 61 N.M. 361, 300 P.2d 943.\n\nTo entitle relator to writ of mandamus he must first showhimself to be entitled legally to some right properly the subject of the writ, and that it is legally demandable from the person to whom the writ is directed; second, that the person to whom the writ is directed still has it in his power to perform the duty required; third, that whatever is required to be done by the said relator as a condition precedent to the right demanded must be shown affirmatively to have been done by him.Territory ex rel. Gildersleeve v. Perea, 1892-NMSC-018, 6 N.M. 531, 30 P. 928,appeal dismissed, 163 U.S. 697, 16 S. Ct. 1207, 41 L. Ed. 307 (1896),overruled on other grounds byCavender v. Phillips, 1937-NMSC-016, 41 N.M. 235, 67 P.2d 250 (decided under former tax law).\n\nRequirement that writ contain allegations of all facts necessary to authorizethe relief sought applies with great reason to peremptory writs of mandamus issued in ex parte proceedings.Mora County Bd. of Educ. v. Valdez, 1956-NMSC-078, 61 N.M. 361, 300 P.2d 943.\n\nRequirements not met when no showing of obligation to act.— Compliance with the requirements of the statute which governs content of writs of mandamus was not had where there was no statement of facts showing respondent's obligation to perform any particular act, and the essential elements were not inferable from what is said in the petition.Birdo v. Rodriguez, 1972-NMSC-062, 84 N.M. 207, 501 P.2d 195.\n\nWrit must allege facts necessary to authorize relief sought.— Once the proceeding is accepted as one in mandamus, then certain well-recognized rules emerge to control the consideration of the case. A most important one is that the case must be tried on the writ and answer. The complaint itself drops out of the picture and the writ must contain allegations of all facts necessary to authorize the relief sought. Furthermore, allegations in the writ should be made as in ordinary actions. Hence, the usual rules applicable in testing the sufficiency of a complaint in an ordinary civil action apply. The facts should be pleaded with the same certainty, neither more nor less.Alfred v. Anderson, 1974-NMSC-036, 86 N.M. 227, 522 P.2d 79.\n\nAppeal dismissed where required procedures in mandamus proceedings not followed.— Where procedures, required in mandamus proceedings, were not followed as no writ ever issued, and the order to show cause did not even closely approximate the requirements of a writ; none of the ordinary elements expected and required to be in a writ were found in the order; no issues were raised or presented at trial in the required manner, and, consequently, could not have been tested as to sufficiency according to ordinary rules of pleading, then an appellate court must dismiss the appeal.Alfred v. Anderson, 1974-NMSC-036, 86 N.M. 227, 522 P.2d 79.\n\nErroneous dismissal contested without formal exception.— A judgment dismissing an action and quashing an alternative writ of mandamus, because of failure of the writ to comply with the requirements of this section, if erroneously entered and appearing in the record proper, is inherently and fatally defective, and may be contested in the supreme court without formal exception.State ex rel. Burg v. City of Albuquerque, 1926-NMSC-031, 31 N.M. 576, 249 P. 242.\n\nWrit not void because title to office incidentally involved.— In mandamus proceeding involving contempt for failure of an official to recognize one of rival claimants for county office, where the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter and the parties, the writ was not void because it involved incidentally the title to the office.Delgado v. Chavez, 1891-NMSC-012, 5 N.M. 646, 25 P. 948,aff'd sub nom.In re Delgado, 140 U.S. 586, 11 S. Ct. 874, 35 L.

Valdez, 1956-NMSC-078, 61 N.M. 361, 300 P.2d 943.\n\nPeremptory writ must contain all necessary facts that authorize relief.— Requirement that the writ contain allegations of all facts necessary to authorize the relief sought applies with great reason to peremptory writs of mandamus issued in ex parte proceedings.Mora County Bd. of Educ. v. Valdez, 1956-NMSC-078, 61 N.M. 361, 300 P.2d 943.\n\nWrit must show that no valid excuse can be given.— Under this section, a peremptory writ of mandamus issued in an ex parte proceeding must contain allegations of all facts necessary to show that the right to require performance of the act sought is clear and that no valid excuse can be given for not performing it.Rivera v. Nunn, 1967-NMSC-159, 78 N.M. 208, 430 P.2d 102.\n\nOnce final judgment reached official's refusal to act unjustified.— Where the final judgment condemned the property and awarded damages to the condemnees, any refusal to act by the officers named would not be justified, because they would have no discretion but to comply with the judgment.State ex rel.

Oman, 459 F. Supp. 436 (D.N.M. 1977).\n\nSuggested action not sufficient predicate for compulsion by writ.— In a judicial decree a finding of fact not followed by a mandatory statement is of no effect. Thus the act sought to be enforced must be based upon the clear direction of the state to a local authority, and a bare finding of fact followed only by a recommendation of suggested action does not afford sufficient predicate for the compulsion of the act.Mora Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v.

Heron v. Kool, 1943-NMSC-027, 47 N.M. 218, 140 P.2d 737.\n\nCase must be tried on writ and answer.— The complaint itself drops out of the picture and the writ must contain allegations of all facts necessary to authorize the relief sought. Furthermore, allegations in the writ should be made as in ordinary actions. Hence, the usual rules applicable in testing the sufficiency of a complaint in an ordinary civil action apply. The facts should be pleaded with the same certainty, neither more nor less.Laumbach v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1955-NMSC-096, 60 N.M. 226, 290 P.2d 1067.\n\nPleadings are to be construed as in ordinary civil actions.State ex rel. Garcia v.

Bd. of Educ. v. Valdez, 1956-NMSC-078, 61 N.M. 361, 300 P.2d 943.\n\nUnless respondent answers allegations as though they were in writ.— Where respondent answers the allegations in the application, treating them as though contained in the alternative writ, they should be treated as supplementing those contained in the writ. Allegations of fact should be pleaded with the same certainty as in ordinary actions.State ex rel. Burg v. City of Albuquerque, 1926-NMSC-031, 31 N.M. 576, 249 P. 242.\n\nTime extension and leave to amend freely given when necessary.— While office of mandamus is to afford a speedy remedy and to avoid delay, this does not mean that the court is without power to extend the time within which a respondent may answer, or that the answer may not be amended, and leave to amend should be freely given when justice demands.State ex rel. Fitzhugh v. City Council of Hot Springs, 1952-NMSC-022, 56 N.M. 118, 241 P.2d 100.\n\nLegal objections raised by answer only.— The issues in mandamus are created solely by and are limited to the allegations of the writ and the answer thereto. Legal objections must be raised by the answer and, where the defense of abandonment of the suit after judgment was not in the pleadings, it could not have been considered or passed upon by the trial court.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Quesenberry, 1963-NMSC-113, 72 N.M. 291, 383 P.2d 255.\n\nIssues must be raised by answer.— In mandamus to compel levy of tax to satisfy judgment on certificates of indebtedness, issues, requiring allegations of fact pleaded in bar should have been raised by answer and not by demurrer (now motion) to alternative writ.State ex rel.

Beall, 1937-NMSC-079, 41 N.M. 652, 73 P.2d 329.\n\nCourt may construe pleading raising legal questions as answer.— Though a motion to dismiss is not an appropriate pleading in mandamus, the court may construe a pleading which raises legal questions as an answer, admitting the facts stated therein and invoking the court's application of the law thereto.State ex rel. Fitzhugh v. City Council of Hot Springs, 1952-NMSC-022, 56 N.M. 118, 241 P.2d 100.\n\nWith exception of pleadings mandamus tried as other civil actions.— Mandamus is a civil action, and, with the exception of the pleadings, is tried and proceeded with in the same manner as other civil actions. The writ and the return constitute all the pleadings which shall be allowed. If the writ does not state sufficient grounds to authorize it, the respondent might demur (now move) thereto, and thus raise a question of law, which, if overruled by the court, would be such a final judgment as would authorize him to appeal.Eldodt v. Territory ex rel. Vaughn, 1900-NMSC-015, 10 N.M. 141, 61 P. 105;Conklin v. Cunningham, 1894-NMSC-005, 7 N.M. 445, 38 P. 170;Perez v.

Anderson, 1974-NMSC-036, 86 N.M. 227, 522 P.2d 79.\n\nJury trial not necessary preliminary to valid judgment.— Determination of the facts by a jury in a mandamus case is not a necessary preliminary to a valid judgment.Delgado v.

(Gild., E.W.S. ed.) 1, 16 P. 855.\n\nInconsistencies in mandamus and quo warranto proceedings grounds for quashing.— The denial in proceedings by mandamus that the plaintiff therein was a de facto sheriff, while maintaining, as he must, in a collateral proceeding by way of quo warranto, that the same person was de facto in charge of the office, was so inconsistent that the return containing the denial could have been quashed for this reason alone.Conklin v. Cunningham, 1894-NMSC-005, 7 N.M. 445, 38 P. 170.\n\nAmicus curiae cannot raise constitutionality where party fails to.— An amicus curiae is not a party and cannot assume the functions of a party; he must accept the case before the court with the issues made by the parties, and if the constitutionality of a statute is not raised by a party claiming to be adversely affected, the amicus curiae cannot do so.State ex rel.
