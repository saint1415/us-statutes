      "text": "In cases of actual controversy, district courts within their respective jurisdictions shall have power to declare rights, status and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed. No action or proceeding shall be open to objection on the ground that a declaratory judgment or decree is prayed for. The declaration may be either affirmative or negative in form and effect and shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 22-6-5, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 340, § 2.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nAdministrative rule-making proceedings.— A court may not intervene in administrative rule-making proceedings before the adoption of a rule or regulation because the separation of powers doctrine forbids a court from prematurely interfering with the administrative processes created by the legislature; only upon completion of administrative rule-making proceedings will a party be certain that it is aggrieved, since it is unknown whether a regulation will even be adopted by the agency; and since the administrative proceeding is not complete, there is no actual controversy to be resolved by a declaratory judgment action.New Energy Econ., Inc. v. Shoobridge, 2010-NMSC-049, 149 N.M. 42, 243 P.3d 746.\n\nWhere plaintiffs filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment to enjoin the environmental improvement board from holding fact-finding hearings on a proposal to regulate green house emissions on the grounds that the board lacked statutory authority to consider the proposal, the question of whether the board's rule-making actions exceeded its legislative authority was not ripe for judicial review because no final rule-making action had occurred and there was not an actual controversy.New Energy Econ., Inc. v. Shoobridge, 2010-NMSC-049, 149 N.M. 42, 243 P.3d 746.\n\nDeclaratory judgment action to determine authority to enact regulations.— A plaintiff may file an action under the Declaratory Judgment Act to raise a purely legal challenge to the environmental improvement board's authority under state law and may file the action independent of the administrative appeal process, with or without the environmental improvement board's consent.State ex rel. Hanosh v. State ex rel. King, 2009-NMSC-047, 147 N.M. 87, 217 P.3d 100,aff'gState ex rel. Hanosh v. N.M. Envtl. Improvement Bd., 2008-NMCA-156, 145 N.M. 270, 196 P.3d 970.\n\n\"Actual controversy\" and \"interested party\" required.— Under this section's predecessor there must have been an \"actual controversy\" and an \"interested party\" petitioning for judgment.State ex rel. Maloney v. Sierra, 1970-NMSC-144, 82 N.M. 125, 477 P.2d 301.\n\nControversy assuring concrete adverseness is key ingredient of standing.— The \"gist of the question of standing\" is whether the party seeking relief has alleged such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure the concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.State ex rel. Overton v. N.M. State Tax Comm'n, 1969-NMSC-140, 81 N.M. 28, 462 P.2d 613.\n\nDecision to accept declaratory judgment jurisdiction discretionary and reviewable.— Whether a court assumes, takes, entertains, accepts or exercises jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment action, or refuses so to do, it is acting within its discretionary power which is subject to review for an alleged abuse thereof.Allstate Ins. Co. v. Firemen's Ins. Co., 1966-NMSC-120, 76 N.M. 430, 415 P.2d 553.\n\nDetermination of remedy may be had before hearing on merits.— Contention that it was mandatory on the district court to hear a case on the merits before it could exercise its discretion to determine whether a declaratory judgment was the appropriate remedy and whether a declaration should be granted or denied was without merit.Allstate Ins. Co. v. Firemen's Ins. Co., 1966-NMSC-120, 76 N.M. 430, 415 P.2d 553.\n\nAction contesting proposed expenditure's constitutionality not premature.— Because the bond issue money has not been raised, nor spent, does not make this a premature suit for declaratory judgment, seeking a declaration that proposed expenditure of money was unconstitutional.Gomez v. Board of Educ., 1971-NMCA-148, 83 N.M. 207, 490 P.2d 465.\n\nStipulation may supply absent allegations of answer.— Where an action for a declaratory judgment is submitted upon a stipulation that completely covers the case, then the matter of pleadings becomes immaterial and the fact that the pleadings contain no allegation upon a certain issue involved will not be considered. A stipulation may supply absent allegations of an answer. A stipulation may supply the failure to allege the amount involved, if such amount is contained in the stipulation itself.Lyle v. Luna, 1959-NMSC-042, 65 N.M. 429, 338 P.2d 1060.\n\nQuestion not pleaded but argued will be considered.— Where a controversial question was not pleaded but argued pro and con in briefs of the parties, the supreme court considers it in the same manner as a cause of action properly pleaded.Laughlin v. Laughlin, 1944-NMSC-062, 49 N.M. 20, 155 P.2d 1010.\n\nDispute turning upon fact question still considered.— That the dispute turns upon question of fact does not withdraw it from judicial cognizance.National Liberty Ins. Co. of Am. v. Silva, 1939-NMSC-023, 43 N.M. 283, 92 P.2d 161;Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 57 S. Ct. 461, 81 L. Ed. 617,reh'g denied, 300 U.S. 687, 57 S. Ct. 461, 81 L. Ed. 617 (1937).\n\nJudgment not disturbed where evidence conflicts and corroboration available.— Where land had been left out of a deed by mutual mistake, a finding to that effect and a determination of the value of the land would not be disturbed on appeal, where the evidence adduced in the declaratory judgment suit was conflicting and corroboration on the part of a disinterested witness was available.Collier v. Sage, 1947-NMSC-025, 51 N.M. 147, 180 P.2d 242.\n\nTrial court may properly grant declaratory and nondeclaratory relief in a single actionwhen such relief is requested in the pleadings by the parties.Sunwest Bank v. Clovis IV, 1987-NMSC-065, 106 N.M. 149, 740 P.2d 699.\n\nII. ACTUAL CONTROVERSY.\n\nAn actual controversy must exist to confer jurisdiction on the district courts.— Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, courts in New Mexico have jurisdiction to adjudicate and declare rights and legal relations only in cases of actual controversy. An actual controversy is not present unless the issue raised by the litigant is ripe for judicial determination and the litigant has standing.AFSCME v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs of Bernalillo Cnty., 2016-NMSC-017,vacating2015-NMCA-070, 352 P.3d 682.\n\nWhere union sought to file a prohibited practice claim with the public employees labor relations board rather than with the county labor board, as designated by the labor-management relations ordinances, claiming that filing with the county labor board would deprive the union and its members of due process because the county labor board's decisions are subject to a biased review by the county commission, the union did not establish the existence of an actual controversy, because the fact that the due process injury would materialize only if the county labor board found a prohibited practice, giving the county commission the right to review, the union failed to satisfy the justiciability requirements of ripeness and the injury-in-fact component of standing, and therefore the district court lacked jurisdiction to decide the merits of the action.AFSCME v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs of Bernalillo Cnty., 2016-NMSC-017,vacating2015-NMCA-070, 352 P.3d 682.\n\nDistrict court properly exercised jurisdiction.— Where the board of pharmacy (board) notified defendants that they needed a pharmacy license to maintain their children, youth and families department (CYFD) licenses because they were considered \"custodial care facilities\" under the Pharmacy Act, §§ 61-11-1 through 61-11-28 NMSA 1978, and where defendants responded that they were not required to hold a pharmacy license because they were not \"custodial care facilities\" but rather \"community homes,\" and where defendants filed a complaint in district court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the Pharmacy Act and the board's regulations from applying to defendants, and where the pharmacy board asserted that no actual controversy existed and therefore the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to issue a decision on the complaint for declaratory judgment and permanent injunction, the district court did not err in exercising jurisdiction over defendants' complaint, because CYFD's threats that defendants' licenses may be suspended or revoked demonstrated that the complaint was ripe and demonstrated a direct and imminent harm to defendants due to the pharmacy board's regulations, sufficient to establish standing.N.M. Boys & Girls Ranch v. N.M. Bd. of Pharmacy, 2022-NMCA-047, cert. denied.\n\nIn order to confer jurisdiction on court to enter declarationan actual controversy must exist.Allstate Ins. Co. v. Firemen's Ins. Co., 1966-NMSC-120, 76 N.M. 430, 415 P.2d 553.\n\nAn actual controversy must exist to confer jurisdiction.Taos County Bd. of Educ. v. Sedillo, 1940-NMSC-026, 44 N.M. 300, 101 P.2d 1027.\n\nQuestion must be real and real interests on both sides.— The only controversy necessary to invoke action of the court and have it declare rights under declaratory judgment provisions is that the question must be real, and not theoretical; the person raising it must have a real interest, and there must be someone having a real interest in the question who may oppose the declaration sought.Taos Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v. Sedillo, 1940-NMSC-026, 44 N.M. 300, 101 P.2d 1027.\n\nRemedy available if threat of unconstitutional deprivation of personal rights.— This remedy is only available under circumstances where one seeking relief is actually threatened with an unconstitutional deprivation of personal rights.Balizer v. Shaver, 1971-NMCA-010, 82 N.M. 347, 481 P.2d 709.\n\nPrerequisites of \"actual controversy\" warranting consideration in declaratory judgment actionare: a controversy involving rights or other legal relations of the parties seeking declaratory relief; a claim of right or other legal interest asserted against one who has an interest in contesting the claim; interests of the parties must be real and adverse; and the issue involved must be ripe for judicial determination.Sanchez v. City of Santa Fe, 1971-NMSC-012, 82 N.M. 322, 481 P.2d 401.\n\nSubject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived or conferred by consent.— There must be an \"actual controversy\" before jurisdiction is obtained. Jurisdiction of the subject matter cannot be conferred by consent of the parties, much less waived by them. Absent jurisdiction over the parties or absent the power or authority to decide the particular matter presented, and the lack of any essential element, is just as fatal to the judgment. If sensed by the court, even though not raised by the parties, the question of jurisdiction compels an answer. There must be a real and not a theoretical question, and the party raising it must have a real interest in the question before a declaratory judgment action will lie.State ex rel. Overton v. N.M. State Tax Comm'n, 1969-NMSC-140, 81 N.M. 28, 462 P.2d 613.\n\nActual controversy when administrative stalemate detrimental to public interest exists.— Where there was an administrative stalemate detrimental to public interest, in which attorney general claimed that entire chapter on liquor sales was unconstitutional contrary to assertion of director of department of alcoholic beverage control, and attorney general construed a separate chapter on liquor sales to allow sale of alcoholic beverages by the drink on Sundays but director denied such an interpretation, there existed an actual controversy between interested parties rendering suit proper for declaratory judgment relief even though a licensed dispenser of alcoholic beverages was not a party.State ex rel. Maloney v. Sierra, 1970-NMSC-144, 82 N.M. 125, 477 P.2d 301.\n\nDeprivation of constitutional rights and prior arrests create actual controversy.— Where complaint alleged that by the use of the color of city vagrancy ordinance, the defendants had deprived and threatened to deprive the plaintiffs of the constitutional privileges and immunities granted to citizens of the United States, such language, coupled with the alleged facts relating to prior arrests of plaintiffs by defendants under vagrancy ordinance, adequately disclosed a fact situation from which it could properly be said that plaintiffs were actually threatened with deprivation of their personal constitutional rights, and consideration of the constitutionality of the ordinance under this section's predecessor was warranted as against the contention that no actual controversy was present, even where both named plaintiffs were acquitted of the charges of vagrancy by the municipal court.Balizer v. Shaver, 1971-NMCA-010, 82 N.M. 347, 481 P.2d 709.\n\nActual controversy where municipality requires and subdivider refuses.— In case where municipality required subdivider to pay a $50.00 fee per lot to be used for subdivision maintenance and improvements, but the subdivider refused to do so, an actual controversy within the ambit of this section existed between the parties.Sanchez v. City of Santa Fe, 1971-NMSC-012, 82 N.M. 322, 481 P.2d 401.\n\nNo actual controversy found in child custody case.— In an action brought pursuant to the federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 1983), because of a social worker's extraterritorial seizure of the plaintiff's child in California based on an ex parte order issued in New Mexico, the court did not err in denying declaratory relief, since full legal and physical custody of the child had been returned to the plaintiff. It is improper to grant declaratory relief in the absence of any actual case or controversy.Yount v. Millington, 1993-NMCA-143, 117 N.M. 95, 869 P.2d 283, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 121, 869 P.2d 820 (1994).\n\nIII. APPLICABILITY.\n\nVenue for declaratory judgment action involving administrative appeals.— Where a statutory procedure existed for seeking judicial review of an administrative decision and the plaintiff initiated the administrative appeals process, the plaintiff could not circumvent the restrictions on where an administrative appeal could be filed by filing a declaratory judgment action.State ex rel. ENMU Regents v. Baca, 2008-NMSC-047, 144 N.M. 530, 189 P.3d 663.\n\nReview of administrative actions.— A declaratory judgment action provides an alternative means of challenging an administrative entity's authority to make a decision if the action involves purely legal issues that do not require fact finding by the administrative entity and if the action does not circumvent established time frames for seeking appellate review of an administrative action.Smith v. City of Santa Fe, 2007-NMSC-055, 142 N.M. 786, 171 P.3d 300.\n\nExhaustion of administrative remedies not required for district court to rule on a purely legal issue.— Exhaustion of administrative remedies was not required for the district court to rule on the purely legal issue of the ex post facto application of a 2009 amendment to 66-5-33.1 NMSA 1978, which required a minimum of six months of driving with an ignition interlock device before reinstatement of a revoked license.Yepa v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2015-NMCA-099, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nAction lies to determine propriety of attorney general's action.— County board of education may properly file suit under this section's predecessor for a declaratory judgment as to the merits of refusal of attorney general to approve issuance of bonds for the purpose of erecting and furnishing school buildings in certain school districts.Taos Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v. Sedillo, 1940-NMSC-026, 44 N.M. 300, 101 P.2d 1027.\n\nTo determine validity of state engineer regulations.— Where there was no statutory right to appeal or other avenue for review of the state engineer's adoption of active water resource management regulations affecting water rights, the proper avenue to challenge the rule-making was through a declaratory judgment action.Tri-State Generation and Transmission Ass'n,. Inc. v. D'Antonio, 2011-NMCA-014, 149 N.M. 386, 249 P.3d 924.\n\nTo determine validity of ordinance.— An action to determine the validity of a municipal ordinance prohibiting the keeping of livestock in certain areas was brought under these provisions.Mitchell v. City of Roswell, 1941-NMSC-007, 45 N.M. 92, 111 P.2d 41.\n\nTo determine corporation's rights under unauthorized contract.— Action to determine rights of corporation under a contract made by its general manager without authority was brought under this section's predecessor.Burguete v. G.W. Bond & Bro. Mercantile Co., 1938-NMSC-075, 43 N.M. 97, 85 P.2d 749.\n\nTo determine governmental agency's insurer's liability.— Where New Mexico department of highways was immune from suit when liability insurance did not cover auto collision for which recovery was sought, declaratory judgment against department's insurer as to coverage, absent which action against department was improper, was proper even though no judgment had been obtained against department.Baca v. N.M. State Hwy. Dep't, 1971-NMCA-087, 82 N.M. 689, 486 P.2d 625.\n\nTo determine whether insured destroyed own property.— Where liability of an insurer for destruction of property by fire depends upon the disputed fact of whether the insured burned his own property, a suit by the insurer under these provisions is authorized.Nat'l. Liberty Ins. Co. of Am. v. Silva, 1939-NMSC-023, 43 N.M. 283, 92 P.2d 161.\n\nTo determine if wages paid according to bargaining agreement.— The president of a union has sufficient interest to bring suit for a declaratory judgment as to whether employer was required to pay employees, members of union, in accordance with scale set up in collective bargaining agreement.Key v. George E. Breece Lumber Co., 1941-NMSC-037, 45 N.M. 397, 115 P.2d 622.\n\nIV. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ACTIONS.\n\nMain characteristic of declaratory judgment which distinguishes itfrom other judgments is the fact that it conclusively declares the preexisting rights of the litigants without the appendage of any coercive decree, and does not seek execution or performance from the defendant or opposing party, for no executory process follows as of course.Savage v. Howell, 1940-NMSC-078, 45 N.M. 527, 118 P.2d 1113.\n\nThese provisions do not enlarge jurisdiction of courts over subjectmatter and parties, but provide an alternative means of presenting controversies to courts having jurisdiction thereof.Allstate Ins. Co. v. Firemen's Ins. Co., 1966-NMSC-120, 76 N.M. 430, 415 P.2d 553.\n\nUnless valid cause of action is stated under rules of substantive law,there can be no recourse to declaratory judgment procedure to reach the desired end. No new substantive rights were created by the Declaratory Judgment Act.American Linen Supply of N.M., Inc. v. City of Las Cruces, 1963-NMSC-176, 73 N.M. 30, 385 P.2d 359.\n\nDeclaratory actions are governed by same limitations applicable to other formsof relief, since the nature of the right sued upon, and not the form of action or relief demanded, determines the applicability of the statute of limitations.Taylor v. Lovelace Clinic, 1967-NMSC-234, 78 N.M. 460, 432 P.2d 816.\n\nNo cause of action where complaint seeks to obtain evidence.— Where complaint seeks the aid of the court to obtain evidence which plaintiff considers necessary to establish an asserted claim or cause of action, and the costs thereof be charged to defendants if plaintiff's position is found to be correct, even though the defendant has agreed to the test if no obligation to pay therefor is placed upon it, trial court was correct in sustaining the motion to dismiss since the complaint stated no cause of action cognizable under this section's predecessor.American Linen Supply of N.M., Inc. v. City of Las Cruces, 1963-NMSC-176, 73 N.M. 30, 385 P.2d 359.\n\nAction not substitute for discovery procedures.— A declaratory judgment is not the proper means nor was it intended to provide a manner of developing proof otherwise not available. It is not a substitute for discovery procedures. It is designed for the determination of issues in recognized causes of action between parties in the light of evidence that each may present without any coercive decree being sought, at least in the first instance.American Linen Supply of N.M., Inc. v. City of Las Cruces, 1963-NMSC-176, 73 N.M. 30, 385 P.2d 359.\n\nApplicable prior determinations made by supreme court cannot be avoidedby the expedient of seeking a declaratory judgment.Collier v. Sage, 1947-NMSC-025, 51 N.M. 147, 180 P.2d 242.\n\nAdministrative remedies must be exhausted.— Where taxpayer does not make timely application for protest before state tax commission (now property tax division) prior to seeking a declaratory judgment in the courts, it is precluded from presenting the case to the courts for review.Associated Petroleum Transp., Ltd. v. Shepard, 1949-NMSC-002, 53 N.M. 52, 201 P.2d 772.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —22A Am.

The determination of price is an actual controversy as contemplated by the declaratory judgment law, and declaratory judgment is a proper means of resolving the questions. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen.

Ed. 2d 488 (1983).\n\nCourt may provide for future proceedings to enforce right declared.— In action under this section's predecessor, the court found that the debt due by plaintiffs to defendant had not been canceled, found the amounts thereof and the nature of the security and provision was made for future proceedings to enforce the rights declared by appropriate remedy.Burguete v. G.W. Bond & Bro. Mercantile Co., 1938-NMSC-075, 43 N.M. 97, 85 P.2d 749 (decision under former, similar provision).\n\nDeclaratory judgment declares preexisting rights without coercive decree.— The principal characteristic of the declaratory judgment which distinguishes it from other judgments is that it declares preexisting rights of the parties without a coercive decree. Execution or performance by the opposing parties does not follow as a matter of course.Pan Am. Petroleum Corp. v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 1966-NMSC-271, 77 N.M. 481, 424 P.2d 397.\n\nWhen necessary or proper coercive decree could be entered.— This section's predecessor did authorize the court, when necessary or proper, to grant complete relief and to enter a coercive decree to carry the declaratory judgment into effect.Pan Am. Petroleum Corp. v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 1966-NMSC-271, 77 N.M. 481, 424 P.2d 397.\n\nCoercive decree granted on showing of need to complete relief.— A coercive decree may only be entered after an order to show cause, and then upon a determination that it should be granted to complete the relief declared.Pan Am.

School Dist. #89 v. N.M. Pub. Educ.

Sedillo, 1940-NMSC-026, 44 N.M. 300, 101 P.2d 1027.\n\nState's consent to sue must otherwise exist.— It could be argued that this section's predecessor was a general consent on the part of the state to be sued under its provisions. However, it has no such meaning and has no greater effect, insofar as this consideration is concerned, than merely to permit parties to sue the state under the act where the state's consent to be sued otherwise exists and the facts warrant suit.In re Bogert, 1958-NMSC-104, 64 N.M. 438, 329 P.2d 1023.\n\nEmployee's action against a State retirement board under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C.S. § 621 et seq., was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity because the ADEA's abrogation of sovereign immunity was not a valid exercise of Congressional power under the Fourteenth Amendment; moreover, the New Mexico Declaratory Judgment Act, 44-6-1 to 44-6-15 NMSA 1978, did not operate to waive immunity.Gill v.

State, 1944-NMSC-068, 48 N.M. 596, 154 P.2d 257.\n\nStatutes which authorize suits against state must be construed strictlyand where a suit to declare a statute unconstitutional is brought against the state it must be dismissed in the absence of express statutory authority for bringing it.Arnold v. State, 1944-NMSC-068, 48 N.M. 596, 154 P.2d 257.\n\nWhere mandamus and prohibition lie declaratory judgment also issues.— Where other remedies such as mandamus or prohibition will lie against a state agency, declaratory judgment should also issue and would not be an enlargement of actions against the state.Harriett v. Lusk, 1958-NMSC-006, 63 N.M. 383, 320 P.2d 738.\n\nActual controversy when administrative stalemate detrimental to public interest exists.State ex rel. Maloney v.

Lusk, 1958-NMSC-006, 63 N.M. 383, 320 P.2d 738.\n\nAdministrative remedies must be exhausted before action lies.— Where taxpayer does not make timely application for protest before state tax commission (now property tax division) prior to seeking a declaratory judgment in the courts, it is precluded from presenting the case to the courts for review.Associated Petroleum Transp., Ltd. v. Shepard, 1949-NMSC-002, 53 N.M. 52, 201 P.2d 772.\n\nOpinion not precedent on justiciable controversy issue if not presented.— When the jurisdiction of the court to render a declaratory judgment has not been questioned for want of a justiciable controversy, but might have been, the opinion of the supreme court is not stare decisis on the question whether such controversy is presented.Taos Cnty.
