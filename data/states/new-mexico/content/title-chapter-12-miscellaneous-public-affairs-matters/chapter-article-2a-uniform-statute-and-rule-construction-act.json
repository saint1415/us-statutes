      "text": "A. This act [12-2A-1 to 12-2A-20 NMSA 1978] may be cited as the \"Uniform Statute and Rule Construction Act\".\n\nB. The Uniform Statute and Rule Construction Act applies to a statute enacted or rule adopted on or after the effective date of that act unless the statute or rule expressly provides otherwise, the context of its language requires otherwise or the application of that act to the statute or rule would be infeasible.\n\nC. Subsection B of this section does not authorize an administrative agency to exempt its rules from a provision of the Uniform Statute and Rule Construction Act.\n\nHistory:Laws 1997, ch. 173, § 1.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 1997, ch. 173 § 22 made the Uniform Statute and Rule Construction Act effective July 1, 1997.\n\nI. IN GENERAL.\n\nConstruction is issue of law.— Where the question is simply one of construction, the courts may pass upon it as an issue \"solely of law.\"Pan Am. Petroleum Corp. v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 1966-NMSC-271, 77 N.M. 481, 424 P.2d 397.\n\nRules of construction to resolve not create ambiguity.— Techniques in aid of construction of a statute are used to resolve an ambiguity, not to create one.Tafoya v. New Mexico State Police Bd., 1970-NMSC-106, 81 N.M. 710, 472 P.2d 973.\n\nRules not inconsistent with intent.— If there be doubt as to a statute's construction, courts are permitted to interpret, to arrive at the intention of the legislature, but rules or canons of construction are not to be invoked to arrive at a construction inconsistent with clear intent.State ex rel. Maloney v. Sierra, 1970-NMSC-144, 82 N.M. 125, 477 P.2d 301.\n\nAll rules of statutory construction are but aidsin arriving at the true legislative intent and should never be used to override same where it otherwise plainly appears.Bradbury & Stamm Constr. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1962-NMSC-078, 70 N.M. 226, 372 P.2d 808.\n\nStatute construed to make whole act consistent.— In statutory construction, the inquiry is to determine what particular words, clauses or provisions mean and to determine the legislative intent. Statutes are enacted as a whole and each part should be construed in connection with every other part to ascertain the intent, and where a comparison of one clause with the statute as a whole makes a meaning clear the act must be so construed as to make the whole consistent.Reed v. Styron, 1961-NMSC-119, 69 N.M. 262, 365 P.2d 912.\n\nWhen power conferred, rights to effect are implied.— It is a fundamental rule of construction that when a power is conferred by statute everything necessary to carry out the power and make it effective and complete will be implied.Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1967-NMSC-182, 78 N.M. 398, 432 P.2d 109.\n\nWhen power not granted is implied.— A power not expressly granted is implied only where it is necessary to carry into effect powers expressly granted.Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1967-NMSC-182, 78 N.M. 398, 432 P.2d 109.\n\nII. CONSTRUCTION OF CONSTITUTION.\n\nUsual principles governing construction of statutes apply also to interpretation of constitutions.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. City of Aztec, 1967-NMSC-046, 77 N.M. 524, 424 P.2d 801.\n\nNo interpretation when provision is clear and unambiguous.— When a constitutional provision is clear and unambiguous, it is not subject to interpretation or construction by this court.State ex rel. Sage v. Montoya, 1959-NMSC-029, 65 N.M. 416, 338 P.2d 1051.\n\nIntent arrived at from vantage point of framers.— What the framers of the constitution intended as disclosed by the language employed is, of course, the interpretation properly to be given the instrument. That intent must be arrived at by construing together its various pertinent provisions and giving to each the meaning which its language most naturally suggests when considered in proper relationship to the others. We should, as nearly as we may, endeavor to look at the instrument from the vantage point of the framers the better to understand their view of the matter and the meaning likely intended. Whenever we refer to the framers that term is to be taken as embracing the people who adopted it. We are not unmindful of the rule of construction applicable to a constitution that its language is to be taken in its common and ordinary sense and as likely understood by the people who adopted it.State ex rel. Witt v. State Canvassing Bd., 1968-NMSC-017, 78 N.M. 682, 437 P.2d 143.\n\nIntent controls literal application of language when result incongruous.— The supreme court is limited to determining the intention of those who adopted the constitution, and where the spirit and intent is clearly ascertainable as contrary to the strict letter of the language and literal application would lead to an incongruous result, it should not be permitted to control.State ex rel. Chavez v. Evans, 1968-NMSC-167, 79 N.M. 578, 446 P.2d 445.\n\nPurpose and scope of constitutional provision must be considered.— Canon of construction that a sovereign is presumptively not intended to be bound by its own statute unless included by the clearest implication is but a rule of construction and consideration must be given to the purpose and scope of the constitutional provision (here N.M. Const., art. IX, § 12) involved.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. City of Aztec, 1967-NMSC-046, 77 N.M. 524, 424 P.2d 801.\n\nDuty of court to declare intent of amendment.— It is the duty of the court to search out and declare the true meaning and intent of any constitutional amendment adopted by the people, and this duty is no different in considering the constitution itself.State ex rel. Chavez v. Evans, 1968-NMSC-167, 79 N.M. 578, 446 P.2d 445.\n\nAmendments valid unless illegal beyond reasonable doubt.— Whenever a constitutional amendment is attacked as not constitutionally adopted, the question presented is, not whether it is possible to condemn, but whether it is possible to uphold; every reasonable presumption, both of law and fact, is to be indulged in favor of the legality of the amendment, which will not be overthrown, unless illegality appears beyond a reasonable doubt.City of Raton v. Sproule, 1967-NMSC-141, 78 N.M. 138, 429 P.2d 336.\n\nThe constitution must be construed as a wholeand the court held that the two sections, N.M. Const., art. V, § 3 and art. VII, § 2, should be read together, thereby requiring that in order to hold the office of governor, a person must be a citizen of the United States, at least 30 years of age, who has been a resident continuously for five years preceding his election and who is a qualified elector in New Mexico.State ex rel. Chavez v. Evans, 1968-NMSC-167, 79 N.M. 578, 446 P.2d 445.\n\nLiberal construction of certain provisions.— Constitutional provision (N.M. Const., art. XIX, § 1) that electors be enabled to vote on amendments separately should receive a liberal, rather than a narrow or technical construction, especially where the legislature obviously considered the problem carefully, and the amendment has been submitted to the people for their vote thereon.City of Raton v. Sproule, 1967-NMSC-141, 78 N.M. 138, 429 P.2d 336.\n\nSupplementary legislation may supply details to constitutional provisions.— Although a self-executing constitutional provision has full force on its own, the legislature may protect or further it through supplementary legislation. That is to say, a legislature may supply details relative to the constitutional provision. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-149.\n\nNo construction when intention clear.— The constitution was written to be understood by the voters; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished from technical meaning; where the intention is clear there is no room for construction and no excuse for interpolation or addition. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-205.\n\nIf meaning of statute doubtful, consequences are considered in construction.1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5878.\n\nRule of employment security commission construed same as statute.— Rule legally promulgated by employment security commission (now employment security division) has the same force as a statute and is therefore subject to the same construction. 1947 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 47-5115.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Approaching Statutory Interpretation in New Mexico,\" see 8 Nat. Resources J. 689 (1968).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 73 Am.

      "text": "Unless a word or phrase is defined in the statute or rule being construed, its meaning is determined by its context, the rules of grammar and common usage. A word or phrase that has acquired a technical or particular meaning in a particular context has that meaning if it is used in that context.\n\nHistory:Laws 1997, ch. 173, § 2.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 1997, ch. 173 § 22 made the Uniform Statute and Rule Construction Act effective July 1, 1997.\n\nPlain meaning and legislative intent.— If the meaning of a statute is truly clear - not vague, uncertain, ambiguous, or otherwise doubtful - it is of course the responsibility of the judiciary to apply the statute as written and not to second-guess the legislature's selection from among competing policies or adoption of one of perhaps several ways of effectuating a particular legislative objective. But courts must exercise caution in applying the plain meaning rule; its beguiling simplicity may mask a host of reasons why a statute, apparently clear and unambiguous on its face, may for one reason or another give rise to legitimate (i.e., nonfrivolous) differences of opinion concerning the statute's meaning. While - as in this case - one part of the statute may appear absolutely clear and certain to the point of mathematical precision, lurking in another part of the enactment, or even in the same section, or in the history or background of the legislation, or in an apparent conflict between the statutory wording and the overall legislative intent, there may be one or more provisions giving rise to genuine uncertainty as to what the legislature was trying to accomplish. In such a case, it is part of the essence of judicial responsibility to search for and effectuate the legislative intent - the purpose or object - underlying the statute.State ex rel. Helman v. Gallegos, 1994-NMSC-023, 117 N.M. 346, 871 P.2d 1352.\n\nApplication of plain meaning rule.— Plain meaning rule does not require a mechanical, literal interpretation of a statute.State v. Calvert, 2003-NMCA-028, 133 N.M. 281, 62 P.3d 372, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 413, 63 P.3d 516.\n\nWhen ordinary meaning given to words.— Ordinary words are given ordinary meaning where there is no evidence of legislative intent to do otherwise.State ex rel. Maloney v. Sierra, 1970-NMSC-144, 82 N.M. 125, 477 P.2d 301.\n\nWhen no intent, otherwise, usual meaning given.— In construing a statute where there is no clearly expressed legislative intent requiring otherwise, the word is to be given its usual, ordinary meaning.Tafoya v. New Mexico State Police Bd., 1970-NMSC-106, 81 N.M. 710, 472 P.2d 973.\n\nUnless different intent indicated words given ordinary meaning.— Words used in a statute are to be given their ordinary and usual meaning unless a different intent is clearly indicated.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Marquez, 1960-NMSC-099, 67 N.M. 353, 355 P.2d 287.\n\nPresumption words are used in ordinary sense.— Statutory words are presumed to be used in their ordinary and usual sense.Bettini v. City of Las Cruces, 1971-NMSC-054, 82 N.M. 633, 485 P.2d 967.\n\nEach word construed with other words to accomplish legislative purpose.— The rules of construction require each word or phrase used in a statute to be construed in connection with every other word, phrase or portion, so as to accomplish the legislative purpose.Peyton v. Nord, 1968-NMSC-027, 78 N.M. 717, 437 P.2d 716.\n\nTechnical words.— The interpretation of technical language in a statute can and should be informed by evidence concerning how those technical terms are interpreted by experts in the pertinent field.Dynacon, Inc. v. D & S Contracting, Inc., 1995-NMCA-071, 120 N.M. 170, 899 P.2d 613.\n\nStatute given effect as written unless different intent.— A statute is to be read and given effect as written and the words used in a statute are to be given their ordinary and usual meaning unless a different intent is clearly indicated.Gonzales v. Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int'l Union, 1966-NMSC-211, 77 N.M. 61, 419 P.2d 257.\n\nStatutes must be read according to their grammatical sense.Garcia v. Schneider, Inc., 1986-NMCA-127, 105 N.M. 234, 731 P.2d 377.\n\nMeaning of \"indebtedness\".— In using word \"indebtedness\" in statute creating and organizing new county, legislature intended what that expression meant in common parlance.Sierra County v. Dona Ana County, 1889-NMSC-017, 5 N.M. 190, 21 P. 83.\n\nMeaning of \"removed\".— The removal contemplated by the word \"removed\" as used in N.M. Const., art. XX, § 2, refers to ouster from office of an officer under the provisions of the statute authorizing removal for misconduct. It has no reference to ouster by quo warranto proceedings, which are invoked and exercised only where a person is usurping the functions of an office to which he has no legal title. The provision clearly intended to permit the immediate removal from office of all officers who were found guilty of misconduct sufficient to oust them from office.Haymaker v. State ex rel. McCain, 1917-NMSC-005, 22 N.M. 400, 163 P. 248.\n\nConstruction of \"the ballot shall contain . . .\".— The words \"the ballot shall contain the text of the ordinance or resolution . . ..\" from Section 3-14-17 NMSA 1978 direct that the ballot show the complete text of a proposed ordinance. The statute is not ambiguous, therefore construction is not called for. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-40.\n\nMeaning of \"vacancy\".— The word \"vacancy,\" as applied to an office, has no technical meaning. An office is vacant whenever it is unoccupied by a legally qualified incumbent who has a lawful right to continue therein until the happening of some future event. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-01.\n\nA statute means what it says.Southern Union Gas Co. v. New Mexico Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 82 N.M. 405, 482 P.2d 913 (1971), overruled on other grounds, De Vargas Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Campbell, 1975-NMSC-026, 87 N.M. 469, 535 P.2d 1320.\n\nWhen statute makes sense no language read into it.— An appellate court may not read into a statute language which is not there, particularly if it makes sense as written. State ex rel. Barela v. New Mexico State Bd. of Educ., 1969-NMSC-038, 80 N.M. 220, 453 P.2d 583.\n\nWhen meaning plain, no construction.— When the meaning of the statute is plain, there is no room for construction. State v. Clark, 1969-NMCA-004, 80 N.M. 91, 451 P.2d 995,rev'd on other grounds, 1969-NMSC-078, 80 N.M. 340, 455 P.2d 844.\n\nWhen words free from ambiguity and doubt, no interpretation.— In interpreting a statute the intent is to be first sought in the meaning of the words used, and when they are free from ambiguity and doubt and express plainly, clearly and distinctly the sense of the legislature, no other means of interpretation should be resorted to. City of Roswell v. New Mexico Water Quality Control Comm'n, 1972-NMCA-160, 84 N.M. 561, 505 P.2d 1237, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 560, 505 P.2d 1236 (1973).\n\nWhen terms plain and unambiguous no room for construction.— The meaning of a statute is to be ascertained primarily from its terms, and where they are plain and unambiguous, there is no room for construction. Southern Union Gas Co. v. New Mexico Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1971-NMSC-035, 82 N.M. 405, 482 P.2d 913,overruled on other grounds, De Vargas Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Campbell, 1975-NMSC-026, 87 N.M. 469, 535 P.2d 1320.\n\nNo room exists for construction whenlanguage of act is clear and unambiguous. Giomi v. Chase, 1942-NMSC-071, 47 N.M. 22, 132 P.2d 715.\n\nStatute free of ambiguity given literal meaning.— Where the statute is free of ambiguity it must be given its literal meaning. Sunset Package Store, Inc. v. City of Carlsbad, 1968-NMSC-105, 79 N.M. 260, 442 P.2d 572.\n\nNo construction when words plain and unambiguous.— If words in the statute being considered are plain and unambiguous, there is no room for construction. State v. McHorse, 1973-NMCA-144, 85 N.M. 753, 517 P.2d 75.\n\nNo construction when words plain and unambiguous.— Where a statute is plain, meaningful and unambiguous, there is no room for construction. State ex rel. Barela v. New Mexico State Bd. of Educ., 1969-NMSC-038, 80 N.M. 220, 453 P.2d 583.\n\nIf language unambiguous legislative intent understood as it is written.— Legislative intent must be ascertained primarily from the language of the statute and if the language used is plain and unambiguous, the legislature must be understood as meaning what is expressly declared. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-63.\n\nUnless ambiguity, no construction.— Rule of statutory construction that unless there is ambiguity in a statute, construction is uncalled for. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-63.\n\nThe plain meaning of the language contained in legislation is controlling.— Once legislation is enacted, the plain meaning of the language contained in the legislation is controlling regardless of a legislator's original intent, and once funds are appropriated by the legislature, those funds cannot be expended for any purpose that the legislature did not contemplate in the statute, and therefore, where a capital outlay funding request that was signed into law in 2019 unequivocally stated that the funds appropriated will be used to \"plan, design, construct, equip and make improvements to Kearns field to comply with the federal American with Disabilities Act of 1990 in Milan in Cibola County\" the appropriation cannot be utilized for any other purpose, regardless of the legislator's original intent in requesting the funding.Legislative intent(4/24/20), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2020-05.\n\nAll parts of act generally considered.— Generally all parts of an act of a legislature should be considered so as to give effect to the whole statute. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6247.",

Boundary Comm'n, 2002-NMCA-024, 131 N.M. 665, 41 P.3d 933.\n\n\"Shall\" and \"may\" not interchangeable, legislative intent determines use.— Whether words of statutes are mandatory or discretionary is a matter of legislative intent to be determined by consideration of the purpose sought to be accomplished and the general rule is that the words \"shall\" and \"may\" shall not be used interchangeably.State ex rel. Robinson v. King, 1974-NMSC-028, 86 N.M. 231, 522 P.2d 83.\n\nDirections not essence of duties not mandatory.— Directions in a statute which are not the essence of things to be done are not commonly considered mandatory, particularly where failure to comply does not result in prejudice.State v. Lindwood, 1968-NMCA-063, 79 N.M. 439, 444 P.2d 766.\n\nIf public interest involved, public officer's power is mandatory.— Where a public officer is clothed with power in permissive form to perform an act in which the interests of the public are concerned, the permissive language of a statute will be construed as mandatory.State ex rel. Robinson v. King, 1974-NMSC-028, 86 N.M. 231, 522 P.2d 83.\n\nWhen \"shall\" mandatory.— A claim for relief \"shall contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" and that \"each averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise and direct.\" The word \"shall\" is mandatory.Mantz v. Follingstad, 1972-NMCA-164, 84 N.M. 473, 505 P.2d 68.\n\n\"Shall\" held mandatory.— \"Shall\" in Section 31-1-3 NMSA 1978, and in former Rule 40, N.M.R. Crim. P. (now Rule 5-607), is mandatory.State v. Davis, 1982-NMCA-057, 97 N.M. 745, 643 P.2d 614.\n\nWhen permissive language mandatory.— Permissive language may be construed as mandatory when it plainly appears that the legislature intended to impose a ministerial duty upon a public official or agency rather than entrust the agency with a judgmental function. A mandatory construction is normally suggested when the public or an individual has a claim de jure which demands that the power conferred upon the administrative agency be exercised for the benefit of that claim. 1971 Op.

Martinez, 2003-NMCA-151, 134 N.M. 665, 81 P.3d 608.\n\nEleven-day rule.— Subsection E of Section 12-2A-7E NMSA 1978 of the Uniform Statute and Rule Construction Act provides the same time computation guideline as Rule 12-308(A) NMRA for the less-than-eleven-days rule, but the act is not applicable to Section 39-3-3B(2) NMSA 1978 as it currently exists, because the act applies only to statutes enacted after its effective date.State v.

Therefore, a claim under the Torts Claim Act was not barred by the two-year statute of limitations of Section 41-4-15 NMSA 1978 when the last day of the two-year period fell on a Saturday and the plaintiff filed her claim on the following Monday.Dutton v.

Madrid, 1930-NMSC-118, 35 N.M. 252, 294 P. 631.\n\nFiling claim.— Filing of claim against estate one year and a day after issuance of letters testamentary was timely where the last day of the year fell on Sunday.O'Brien v. Wilson, 1921-NMSC-022, 26 N.M. 641, 195 P. 803.\n\nService and return at any hour of day.— Service at any hour on November 19th was sufficient for any hour of November 24th as a return day.Pickering v. Justice of Peace, 1911-NMSC-006, 16 N.M. 37, 113 P. 619.\n\nStatute becomes effective at first moment of applicable day.— In calculating effective date of a new act, day of the event is to be excluded and last day of interim period is included, so that statute becomes effective at first moment of applicable day after the event, such as first moment of 90th day after adjournment of legislature.Garcia v. J.C. Penney Co., 1948-NMSC-065, 52 N.M. 410, 200 P.2d 372.\n\nApplicability to constitutional conventions.— The rule expressed in former Subsection H (now I) of Section 12-2-2 NMSA 1978 was limited to the computation of time for legislative sessions and did not apply when construing Laws 1969, ch. 134, § 15 (purporting to set a time limit on the constitutional convention). 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-82.\n\nDays counted consecutively.— The legislative rule of statutory construction assumed that in computing periods of time set forth in legislative enactments, it is intended that days be counted consecutively. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-82.\n\nAny time during last day sufficient.— A lot sold for taxes at 10 o'clock in the forenoon on January 30, 1912, could be redeemed by the original owner, or by a person purchasing from the original owner, at any time before the close of January 30, 1915. 1915 Op.

Because capital felonies and first-degree violent felonies committed after July 1, 1982, were not time-barred as of the effective date of the 1997 amendment of Section 30-1-8 NMSA 1978, the legislature intended the 1997 amendment to apply to these crimes.State v. Morales, 2010-NMSC-026, 148 N.M. 305, 236 P.3d 24.\n\nPresumption in favor of prospective operation unless clear intent otherwise.— It is presumed that statutes will operate prospectively only, unless an intention on the part of the legislature is clearly apparent to give them retrospective effect.State v.

Padilla, 1968-NMCA-004, 78 N.M. 702, 437 P.2d 163.\n\nRetroactive operation not mandated by existence of facts prior to enactment.— A statute does not operate retroactively merely because some of the facts or conditions upon which its application depends came into existence prior to the enactment.State v. Mears, 1968-NMCA-098, 79 N.M. 715, 449 P.2d 85.\n\nClarification of existing law.— A statute which clarifies existing law may properly be regarded as having prospective effect.Swink v. Fingado, 115 N.M. 275, 850 P.2d 978 (1993).\n\nAs a general rule retrospective legislation is not favored.— As a general rule, retrospective or retroactive legislation is not looked upon with favor. For this reason, it is a well established and fundamental rule of statutory construction that all statutes are to be construed as having only a prospective operation. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-203.\n\nTherefore all statutes operate prospectively and not retrospectively.— All statutes are to be construed as having only a prospective operation and not as operating retrospectively. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-261.\n\nClear intent is for retrospective effect.— Statutes are presumed to have only prospective effect unless there is strong and clear language of an intent for them to have a retrospective effect. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-192.\n\nIntent controls retroactively but an emergency clause implies prospective effect.— Generally, statutes will not be given a retroactive interpretation, especially where the enactment is in derogation of a common-law right or where such interpretation would interfere with an existing contract or create a new liability in connection with a past transaction, invalidate a previously valid defense, or where such an interpretation would render a statute unconstitutional. However, if the intention that a law be retroactive is manifest, such intention will control even though not expressly stated. On the other hand, an emergency clause in the enactment is some indication that the law was not intended to have retroactive effect. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-127.\n\nStatutes of limitation ordinarily will not be given retroactive effectunless it clearly appears that the legislature so intended. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-203.\n\nNew matter in amended statute has no retrospective effect.— A statute amending a prior one by declaring that it shall be amended so as to read in a given manner has no retrospective effect. The portion of the amended statute, which is merely copied without change, is not to be considered as repealed and again enacted, but to have been the law; and the new parts are not to be taken as to have been the law prior to the passage of the amended statute. 1957 Op.

City of Grants, 1969-NMSC-115, 80 N.M. 533, 458 P.2d 785.\n\nEffect of partially invalid statute.— Before a partially invalid statute can be held to still be in force it must satisfy three tests: first, the invalid portion must be able to be separated from the other portions without impairing their effect; second, the legislative purpose expressed in the valid portion of the act must be able to be given effect without the invalid portion; and, thirdly, it cannot be said, on a consideration of the whole act, that the legislature would not have passed the valid part if it had known that the objectionable part was invalid.State v. Spearman, 1972-NMCA-150, 84 N.M. 366, 503 P.2d 649.\n\nInterdependence of both valid and invalid provisions is controlling factor.— The invalidity of a portion of a legislative enactment does not operate to invalidate those portions of the act which are free from objection unless there is such interdependence of all provisions so as to make it reasonably certain that absent the part determined to be invalid, the legislature would not have enacted the valid portion.Clovis Nat'l Bank v.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION\n\nUsing legislative intent.— Where three acts were enacted to amend Section 66-8-102 NMSA 1978 at the same session of the legislature, were signed by the governor on different dates, and had different effective dates and did not conflict with each other, the language of the three enactments, in addition to their titles and purposes, indicated that the objective of the legislature was to make specific, independent improvements to the statute and permitted the three enactments to be construed harmoniously to give effect to each enactment. In the course of amending an existing law, if the legislature restates existing law to comply with Article IV, Section 18 of the New Mexico constitution, the courts are not obligated to read into that legislative act a repeal by implication of other legislation passed in the same session. A better rule is to make legislative intent paramount to the application of a mechanical rule.State v. Smith, 2004-NMSC-032, 136 N.M. 372, 98 P.3d 1022.\n\nAmendment or repeal by implication not unconstitutional.— Fact that act may amend or repeal certain provisions of other statutes by implication does not offend against N.M. Const., art. IV, § 18, referring to amendments.State ex rel. Taylor v. Mirabal, 1928-NMSC-056, 33 N.M. 553, 273 P. 928.\n\nTwo statutes covering same subject matter should be harmonized.— When two statutes are enacted by the legislature covering the same subject matter, one of them in general terms and the other in a more detailed way, the two should be harmonized, if possible, and construed together.State v. Rue, 1963-NMSC-090, 72 N.M. 212, 382 P.2d 697.\n\nIf two statutes not absolutely irreconcilable both given effect.— Repeals of statutes by implication are not favored, and when two statutes cover in whole or in part the whole matter and are not absolutely irreconcilable, effect should be given if possible to both of them.Waltom v. City of Portales, 1938-NMSC-022, 42 N.M. 433, 81 P.2d 58;White v. Board of Educ., 1938-NMSC-009, 42 N.M. 94, 75 P.2d 712;State v. Moore, 1936-NMSC-044, 40 N.M. 344, 59 P.2d 902;Atchison, T. & S.F.

Meeks, 1906-NMSC-032, 13 N.M. 565, 86 P. 801.\n\nWhere apparent conflict, without repeal statute will be reconciled.— Where there is an apparent conflict between two acts, without any repeal, the two will be reconciled.State v. Moore, 1936-NMSC-044, 40 N.M. 344, 59 P.2d 902.\n\nPresumption that legislature knew existing law and did not intend inconsistency.— In interpreting a statute this court may presume that the legislature was informed as to existing law, and that the legislature did not intend to enact a law inconsistent with any existing law or not in accord with common sense or sound reasoning.City Comm'n of Albuquerque v. State ex rel. Nichols, 1965-NMSC-104, 75 N.M. 438, 405 P.2d 924.\n\nNot construed together if repugnancy or unreasonableness would result.— Statutes relating to same subject should be construed together if possible, but this effect should not be accorded to statutes when it leads to contradiction or repugnancy, absurdity or unreasonableness.In re Martinez' Will, 1942-NMSC-026, 47 N.M. 6, 132 P.2d 422.\n\nIf two sections from same act conflict, last placed controls.— The sentence concerning requirement that directors be stockholders, contained in 51-2-14 (since repealed), is in § 5 and the one found in 51-6-1 (since repealed) is in § 8 of the 1927 amendment. If two provisions of the same statute are irreconcilable, the provision last placed will be deemed to repeal the other. The sentence quoted from 51-6-1 was the provision last placed and was controlling.Great W. Constr. Co. v. N.C. Ribble Co., 1967-NMSC-085, 77 N.M. 725, 427 P.2d 246.\n\nPenalty provisions of pari materia statutes are irreconcilable, later controlling.— Two statutes where they condemn the same act are in pari materia. The penalty provisions being different, they are irreconcilable, impliedly intending that the last expression of the legislature should control.State v. Chavez, 1966-NMSC-217, 77 N.M. 79, 419 P.2d 456.\n\nII. GENERAL-SPECIFIC STATUTES.\n\nGoal of general/specific statute rule.— The primary goal of the general/specific statute rule is to determine legislative intent in the context of potentially conflicting laws. The general/specific statute rule provides a method to resolve an otherwise irreconcilable conflict between statutes by treating the specific statute as an exception to the general statute. For criminal statutes, the rule has both a particular analytical framework and a particular result. In analysis, the court determines whether the general/specific statute rule applies to two criminal statutes by comparing the elements of the crimes and, if necessary, resorting to other indicia of legislative intent.State v. Cleve, 1999-NMSC-017, 127 N.M. 240, 980 P.2d 23.\n\nApplication of general/specific statute rule.— The general/specific rule applies to both civil and criminal statutes.State v. Blevins, 1936-NMSC-052, 40 N.M. 367, 60 P.2d 208.\n\nGeneral/specific statute rule in criminal cases.— The goal of the general/specific statute rule in the context of criminal law is to determine whether the legislature intends to punish particular criminal conduct under a specific statute instead of a general statute. Because this goal mirrors the purpose of the rule in general, there is no need to undertake a separate, duplicative inquiry under the label of preemption to determine whether the special criminal statute operates as an exception to the general criminal statute. As between two criminal statutes, the \"exception\" that is the relevant focus of the general/specific statute rule is a legislative intent that particular criminal conduct be prosecuted under one statute instead of another.State v. Santillanes, 2001-NMSC-018, 130 N.M. 464, 27 P.3d 456.\n\nConflicts between general and specific statutes are resolved by giving effect to specific statute.Lopez ex rel. Lopez v. Barreras, 1966-NMSC-209, 77 N.M. 52, 419 P.2d 251.\n\nSpecific statute superseding general statute considered exception to general statute.— A statute enacted for the primary purpose of dealing with a particular subject prescribing terms and conditions covering the subject matter supersedes a general statute which does not refer to that subject although broad enough to cover it as the specific statute is considered an exception to or qualification of the general statute.Lopez ex rel. Lopez v. Barreras, 1966-NMSC-209, 77 N.M. 52, 419 P.2d 251.\n\nGeneral provision relates to same subject specific controls.— It is well settled that a general provision is controlled by one that is special, the later being treated as an exception to the former. A specific provision relating to a particular subject will govern in respect to that subject as against a general provision although the later standing alone would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more particular provision relates.Cromer v. J.W. Jones Constr. Co., 1968-NMCA-027, 79 N.M. 179, 441 P.2d 219;overruled on other grounds bySchiller v. Southwest Air Rangers, Inc., 1975-NMSC-018, 87 N.M. 476, 535 P.2d 1327.\n\nIII. REPEAL BY IMPLICATION.\n\nWithout repealing clause prior statute not abrogated unless inconsistency exists.— In absence of repealing clause expressly designating the prior enactment intended to be abrogated, no new statute will be allowed to sweep away existing legislation unless its terms are such that the new and the old cannot stand together consistently.Wilburn v. Territory, 1900-NMSC-028, 10 N.M. 402, 62 P. 968.\n\nGeneral words of repeal add nothing to effect of repealing clause.— Use, in repealing clause, of words \"all acts and parts of acts in conflict herewith\" adds nothing to the repealing effect of later legislation and repeals nothing which would not be repealed by implication without those words.Territory ex rel. City of Albuquerque v. Matson, 1911-NMSC-016, 16 N.M. 135, 113 P. 816.\n\nRepeals by implication are not favored,and will not be held to exist where any other reasonable construction can be placed upon two statutes.State v. Davisson, 1923-NMSC-045, 28 N.M. 653, 217 P. 240, error dismissed, 267 U.S. 574, 45 S. Ct. 229, 69 L. Ed. 795 (1925).\n\nRepeals by implication are not to be favored; statutes should be construed together where the objects to be obtained by each can be preserved.Territory ex rel. White v. Riggle, 1911-NMSC-074, 16 N.M. 713, 120 P. 318.\n\nEven in absence of repealing clause prior repugnant statute impliedly repealed.— Where later of two statutes having same object and relating to same subject is repugnant to earlier statute, earlier statute is impliedly repealed to extent of repugnancy, even in absence of a repealing clause.Baca v. Board of County Comm'rs, 1900-NMSC-031, 10 N.M. 438, 62 P. 979.\n\nWhen wholly irreconcilable prior statute repealed by later.— A statute may be repealed without being referred to by a subsequent statute on the same subject, when the last statute is wholly irreconcilable with the former and both cannot stand together.Nye v. Board of Comm'rs, 1932-NMSC-009, 36 N.M. 169, 9 P.2d 1023;Sandoval v. Board of County Comm'rs, 1906-NMSC-028, 13 N.M. 537, 86 P. 427;Geck v. Shepherd, 1859-NMSC-010, 1 N.M. 346.\n\nStatute repealed by implication when such intent is manifest.— A statute is repealed by implication, though such repeal is not favored, where the legislative intent that later statute supersede former is manifest; such intent is manifest where the legislature enacts a new and comprehensive body of law which is so inconsistent with and repugnant to the former law on the same subject as to be irreconcilable with it; especially does this result follow where later act expressly notices the former in such a way as to indicate an intention to abrogate.Ellis v. New Mexico Constr. Co., 1921-NMSC-068, 27 N.M. 312, 201 P. 487.\n\nWhen later statute is broad and comprehensive implied repeal results.— Though repeals by implication are not favored, yet courts declare them in cases where the last statute is so broad in its terms and so clear and explicit in its words as to show it was intended to cover the whole subject, and, therefore, to displace the prior statute.Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. v. Town of Silver City, 1936-NMSC-036, 40 N.M. 305, 59 P.2d 351;State ex rel. County Comm'rs v. Romero, 1914-NMSC-023, 19 N.M. 1, 140 P. 1069.\n\nNo implied repeal unless new act is clearly repugnant or comprehensive.— If there is no express reference to existing statute or apparent intention to repeal the same, it is to be concluded that the legislature did not intend to abrogate the former law relating to the same matter, unless the later act is clearly repugnant to the prior one, or completely covers and embraces the subject-matter thereof, or unless the reason for the prior act is removed.Smith v. City of Raton, 1914-NMSC-017, 18 N.M. 613, 140 P. 109.\n\nEarlier law repealed by implication when irreconcilable with later law.— Repeal by implication is not favored, but an earlier law is necessarily repealed by implication when it is absolutely irreconcilable with a later law.Territory v. Digneo, 1909-NMSC-018, 15 N.M. 157, 103 P. 975.\n\nRepealed by implication only to extent statutes are incompatible.— Later statute repeals earlier statute by implication only to extent that statutes are incompatible.State v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., 1932-NMSC-022, 36 N.M. 166, 9 P.2d 700.\n\nGeneral statute not regarded as repealing particular or limited statute.— A general statute will not be regarded as repealing by implication a statute dealing with a particular matter and of limited scope.Waltom v. City of Portales, 1938-NMSC-022, 42 N.M. 433, 81 P.2d 58.\n\nRepeal is necessary to give later general statute effect.— A subsequent statute treating a subject in general terms will not be held to repeal by implication an earlier statute treating the same subject specifically, unless such construction is absolutely necessary in order to give the subsequent statute effect.State ex rel. Armijo v. Romero, 1927-NMSC-008, 32 N.M. 178, 253 P. 20.\n\nUnless subsequent general statute positively repugnant to specific.— General statute will not impliedly repeal prior local law or special statute or charter unless there is such a positive repugnance between the two that both cannot stand together or be consistently reconciled.Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. v. Town of Silver City, 1936-NMSC-036, 40 N.M. 305, 59 P.2d 351.\n\nSpecific statutes control general regardless of priority of enactment.— The rule that a statute relating to a specific subject controls a general statute which includes the specific subject in the generality of its terms is not dependent upon the time of the enactment of such statutes. It prevails without regard to priority of enactment. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-13.\n\nTo extent of irreconcilability special or specific provision controls general.— As a general rule general or broad statutory provisions do not control, modify, limit, affect or interfere with special or specific provisions. To the contrary, to the extent of any irreconcilable conflict, the special or specific provision modifies, qualifies, limits, restricts, excludes, supersedes, controls and prevails over the general or broad provisions. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-13.\n\nStrong showing of intent required to create exception to general rule.— In the face of two important canons of statutory construction (presumption against repeal by implication and rule that special act controls over general act to extent of any conflict), it takes a strong showing of legislative intention to create an exception to the general rule. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-13.\n\nIf repugnant, former repealed to extent of repugnancy.— Although repeals by implication are not favored where two statutes have the same object and relate to the same subject, if the later is repugnant to the former, the former is repealed by implication to the extent of the repugnancy in the absence of a repealing clause in the later act. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-16.\n\nWhen two statutes cannot be construed together last enacted survives.— Where two statutes cannot be construed so as to give effect to each without contradiction or repugnancy or absurdity or unreasonableness, the last enacted will survive. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-192.\n\nIf possible, unless conflict irreconcilable, court will keep both laws operative.— Repeal of statute by implication will not be indulged unless the later act is so repugnant to the earlier as to render the repugnancy or conflict between them irreconcilable, and a court will if possible adopt that conclusion which under the particular circumstances will permit both laws to be operative. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-192.\n\nSpecific enactment governs general when enacted at same legislature.— In the event of a conflict between two or more enactments of the same legislature, the special and not the general enactment will govern. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-184.\n\nFormer repugnant act repealed even in absence of repealing clause.— The doctrine that repeals by implication is not favored is firmly imbedded in law, but we are equally committed to the rule that where two statutes have the same object and relate to the same subject, if the later act is repugnant to the former, the former is repealed by implication to the extent of the repugnancy, even in the absence of the repealing clause in the later act. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-116.\n\nWhen two statutes passed at same session are irreconcilable, later prevails.— The principle that repeals by implication are not favored needs no citation of authority. This principle is specially applicable as between two statutes passed at the same session of the legislature. However, if the enactments are irreconcilable, the one which is the later expression of the legislative intent ordinarily prevails over and impliedly repeals the other enactment. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-184.\n\nStatute which is last in order of time or local position prevailsover that which is first. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-184.\n\nWell settled proposition that two statutes be construed together.— Repeals by implication are not favored, and wherever possible, two statutes will be construed together so that the objects to be attained by each will be preserved, if no contradiction, repugnancy, absurdity or unreasonableness will result. This proposition is well settled in New Mexico. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-241.\n\nContradictory statutes.— If two statutes appear in contradictory position, such interpretation as will reconcile the seeming contradiction will be favored. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-298.\n\nInterpretation reconciling seemingly contradictory provisions is favored.— If two constitutional or statutory provisions are in seeming contradiction, if some interpretation can be drawn as will leave both provisions operative, such interpretation will be favored. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-204.\n\nIf statutes are cumulative or reconcilable all are given effect.— One or two affirmative statutes on the same subject matter does not repeal the other if both can stand, as where they are cumulative. The court will, if possible, give effect to all statutes covering, in whole or in part, the same subject matter where they are not absolutely irreconcilable and no purpose of repeal is clearly shown or indicated. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-95.\n\nInsofar as conflict is concerned last enacted repeals first.— Wherever there is an irreconcilable conflict in two enactments of the legislature, the last in point of time will be deemed to have repealed the first enactment insofar as the conflict is concerned. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6359.\n\nGeneral/specific rule applies when construing parts of same act.— In construing several parts of the same act together, it is the generally accepted rule that a specific power or provision governs where a general power or provision in the same act can be construed to cover the same area. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6326.\n\nGeneral/specific rule does not apply where legislature intended otherwise.— Where general provisions, terms or expressions in one part of a statute are inconsistent with more specific or particular provisions in another part, the particular provisions must govern or control as a clearer and more definite expression of the legislative will, unless the statute as a whole clearly shows a legislative intention to the contrary, or some other canon of statutory construction compels a contrary conclusion. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6259.\n\nInconsistent statutes passed by same session of legislature.— Where two statutes are inconsistent and are passed by the same session of the legislature and both become effective at the same time, the supreme court has held that the law being last in place, position or sequence will govern and repeal by implication the earlier statute. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6076.\n\nPresumption that all laws consistent.— It is a maxim of statutory construction that an interpretation of a statute which creates an inconsistency should be avoided, and since all laws are presumed to be consistent with each other, every effort should be made to harmonize and reconcile them. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5635.",

In such cases it was manifest that legislature did not intend to revive the original act, but to legislate anew upon the subject.Gallegos v. Atchison, T. & S.F.

The first is the common law where the repealing statute is repealed prior to the enactment of this section. The second is by the annulment of a repealing statute under the provisions of the constitution.

      "text": "A. A statute or rule is construed, if possible, to:\n\n(1) give effect to its objective and purpose;\n\n(2) give effect to its entire text; and\n\n(3) avoid an unconstitutional, absurd or unachievable result.\n\nB. A statute that is intended to be uniform with those of other states is construed to effectuate that purpose with respect to the subject of the statute.\n\nC. The presumption that a civil statute in derogation of the common law is construed strictly does not apply to a statute of this state.\n\nHistory:Laws 1997, ch. 173, § 18.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 1997, ch. 173 § 22 made the Uniform Statute and Rule Construction Act effective July 1, 1997.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nPrinciples of statutory interpretation.— If a statute is ambiguous, then to ascertain the legislature's intent the court considers the legislative purpose behind the statute to effectuate the intent of the statute and accomplish its objectives and statutes concerning similar subject matter, relevant common law principles and public policy; and reads the provisions of the statute together with statutes pertaining to the same subject to achieve a harmonious whole.Pub. Serv. Co. of N.M. v. Diamond D Constr. Co., 2001-NMCA-082, 131 N.M. 100, 33 P.3d 651, cert. quashed, 131 N.M. 221, 34 P.3d 610.\n\nAbsurd meaning to be avoided.— The court is not bound by a literal interpretation of the words of a statute if a strict interpretation would defeat the intended object of the legislature. Thus, words can be added, and words in a statute can be read as though they were omitted, if that is necessary to effectuate legislative intent and prevent an absurd and unreasonable meaning.State v. Romero, 2000-NMCA-029, 128 N.M. 806, 999 P.2d 1038.\n\nInterest in uniformity.— Courts may consider other jurisdictions' interpretations of Uniform Health Care Decisions Act to effectuate the purpose of uniformity with other states that have likewise adopted the Uniform Act. Corum v.Roswell Senior Living LLC, 2010-NMCA-105, 149 N.M. 287, 248 P.3d 329, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-010, 149 N.M. 64, 243 P.3d 1146.\n\nConstructive service of process is in derogation of common law;it is harsh; and a statute authorizing it is to be strictly construed.Kalosha v. Novick, 1973-NMSC-010, 84 N.M. 502, 505 P.2d 845.\n\nTort Claims Act in derogation of common-law rights.— A court must strictly construe the Tort Claims Act, since it is in derogation of one's common-law right to sue for negligence.Wells v. County of Valencia, 1982-NMSC-048, 98 N.M. 3, 644 P.2d 517.\n\nExemption statutes are liberally construed in favor of debtor.Advance Loan Co. v. Kovach, 1968-NMSC-154, 79 N.M. 509, 445 P.2d 386;McFadden v. Murray, 1927-NMSC-039, 32 N.M. 361, 257 P. 999.\n\nConstruction of \"electors voting in the whole state\".— To construe \"electors voting in the whole state\" (N.M. Const., art. XIX, § 1) to mean in effect, \"all electors voting at the election,\" as distinguished from those voting on the particular amendment, would have the effect of making the \"unamendable section\" (N.M. Const., art. VII, § 1) even more unamendable than would otherwise be true. To so hold would in effect attribute to the membership of the convention, the congress of the United States and the electorate who ratified the constitution and the amendment to N.M. Const., art. XIX, § 1 the intention of incorporating provisions which ostensibly provide for amendment while in fact making it impossible.State ex rel. Witt v. State Canvassing Bd., 1968-NMSC-017, 78 N.M. 682, 437 P.2d 143 (decided under prior law).\n\nUse of \"void\" and \"voidable\".— The word \"void\" is not always used in an absolute or in its literal sense but may be and often is used in the sense of \"voidable.\" Where an enactment has relation only to the benefit of particular persons, \"void\" will be understood as \"voidable\" only at the election of the person or persons for whose protection the enactment was made, provided they are capable of protecting themselves. \"Absolutely void\" is that which the law or nature of things forbids to be enforced at all, and that is \"relatively void\" which the law condemns as a wrong to individuals and refuses to enforce against them.State ex rel. State Tax Comm'n v. Garcia, 1967-NMSC-098, 77 N.M. 703, 427 P.2d 230.\n\nApplication of ejusdem generis.— The rule of statutory construction, ejusdem generis, is that general words in a statute, which follow a designation or enumeration of particular subjects, objects, things or classes of persons, will ordinarily be presumed to be restricted so as to embrace only subjects, objects, things or classes of the same general character, sort or kind, to the exclusion of all others. It arises from the presumption that, having enumerated a list of things or persons, the legislature must have had in mind no other kind.Cardinal Fence Co. v. Comm'r of Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-136, 84 N.M. 314, 502 P.2d 1004.\n\nState of law when act passed may aid construction.— In the interpretation of a statute, changes made by the act in the previous state of the law may be given consideration. Indeed, one of the recognized rules of construction of statutes is to look to the state of the law when the statute was enacted in order to see for what is was intended as a substitute.Bettini v. City of Las Cruces, 1971-NMSC-054, 82 N.M. 633, 485 P.2d 967.\n\nOne guide is history and prior condition of law.— One guide in the construction of a statute that is most useful to the courts is the consideration of the history and prior condition of a particular law.Munroe v. Wall, 1959-NMSC-054, 66 N.M. 15, 340 P.2d 1069.\n\nSeverability clause an aid in construction.— The presence or absence of a severability clause merely provides one rule of construction which may be considered and may sometimes aid in determining legislative intent, \"but it is an aid merely; not an inexorable command.\"Bradbury & Stamm Constr. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1962-NMSC-078, 70 N.M. 226, 372 P.2d 808.\n\nThe plain meaning of the language contained in legislation is controlling.— Once legislation is enacted, the plain meaning of the language contained in the legislation is controlling regardless of a legislator's original intent, and once funds are appropriated by the legislature, those funds cannot be expended for any purpose that the legislature did not contemplate in the statute, and therefore, where a capital outlay funding request that was signed into law in 2019 unequivocally stated that the funds appropriated will be used to \"plan, design, construct, equip and make improvements to Kearns field to comply with the federal American with Disabilities Act of 1990 in Milan in Cibola County\" the appropriation cannot be utilized for any other purpose, regardless of the legislator's original intent in requesting the funding.Legislative intent(4/24/20), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2020-05.\n\nII. CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY.\n\nConstitutional limitations are sole restraints upon legislature's prerogatives.— The legislature's prerogative in the matter of legislation is to be questioned solely from the standpoint of our federal or state constitutional limitations. The function of the courts in scrutinizing acts of the legislature is not to raise possible doubt nor to listen to captious criticism. The legislature possessing the sole power of enacting law, it will not be presumed that the people have intended to limit its power or practice by unreasonable or arbitrary restrictions. Every presumption is ordinarily to be indulged in favor of the validity and regularity of legislative acts and procedure.State ex rel. Holmes v. State Bd. of Fin., 1961-NMSC-172, 69 N.M. 430, 367 P.2d 925.\n\nPresumption that legislature kept within bounds of constitution.— In determining the constitutionality of an act of the legislature, the presumption is that the legislature has performed its duty and kept within the bounds fixed by the constitution, and that the judiciary will, if possible, give effect to the legislative intent, unless it clearly appears to be in conflict with the constitution.Seidenberg v. N. M. Bd. of Med. Examiners, 1969-NMSC-028, 80 N.M. 135, 452 P.2d 469.\n\nPolicy of court to construe statutes in light of presumed constitutionality.— The court will construe statutes in the light that they are presumed constitutional rather than unconstitutional.State ex rel. City of Albuquerque v. Lavender, 1961-NMSC-096, 69 N.M. 220, 365 P.2d 652.\n\nEvery presumption favoring constitutionality indulged.— In passing on issues of constitutionality of statutes the court must indulge every presumption in favor of validity of the enactment.Board of Dirs. of Mem'l Gen. Hosp. v. County Indigent Hosp. Claims Bd., 1967-NMSC-042, 77 N.M. 475, 423 P.2d 994.\n\nStatute should be construed so as to avoid conflict with constitutionand give effect to statute whenever possible; all doubts should be resolved in favor of constitutionality of statute.State ex rel. Sedillo v. Sargent, 1918-NMSC-042, 24 N.M. 333, 171 P. 790.\n\nUnless no other conclusion reasonable, acts not unconstitutional.— Legislative acts should not be held unconstitutional unless no other conclusion can reasonably be reached and all doubts must be resolved in favor of constitutionality.Peyton v. Nord, 1968-NMSC-027, 78 N.M. 717, 437 P.2d 716.\n\nIn any event, doubt is resolved in favor of constitutionality of statutes.Daniels v. Watson, 1966-NMSC-011, 75 N.M. 661, 410 P.2d 193.\n\nUnconstitutionality must be proven beyond all reasonable doubt.— A statute will not be declared unconstitutional unless the court is satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the legislature went outside the constitution in enacting the challenged legislation.City of Raton v. Sproule, 1967-NMSC-141, 78 N.M. 138, 429 P.2d 336.\n\nIII. CRIMINAL STATUTES.\n\nAmbiguity in criminal statute construed against the state.— Courts will not add words in the construction of a statute, except where it is necessary to do so to make the statute conform to the obvious intent of the legislature, or to prevent absurdity, and if there be any ambiguity or doubt concerning the meaning of a criminal statute, it will be construed against the state which enacted it and in favor of the accused.State v. Ortiz, 1967-NMCA-019, 78 N.M. 507, 433 P.2d 92.\n\nCourt will not change or limit wording in criminal statutein order to construe it against the accused. Penal statutes are strictly construed and should be of sufficient certainty so that a person will know his act is criminal when he does it.State v. Collins, 1969-NMSC-104, 80 N.M. 499, 458 P.2d 225.\n\nCriminal statutes fairly and reasonably construed as to both sides.— The cardinal rule in the construction of a statute is to ascertain the intention of the legislature as it is expressed in the words of the statute, and for this purpose the whole act must be considered. The law, it is true, in its tenderness for life and liberty, requires that penal statutes shall be strictly construed, by which is meant that courts will not extend punishment to cases not plainly within the language used. At the same time such statutes are to be fairly and reasonably construed, and the courts will not by a narrow and strained construction exclude from its operation cases plainly within their scope of meaning.State v. Garcia, 1971-NMCA-186, 83 N.M. 490, 493 P.2d 975, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 473, 493 P.2d 958 (1972).\n\nIntendment not to broaden penal statutes.— Penal statutes must be strictly construed, and the definition of crimes therein contained is not to be broadened by intendment.State v. Allen, 1967-NMSC-029, 77 N.M. 433, 423 P.2d 867.\n\nPenal statutes must be strictly interpreted with respect to offense.State v. Shop Rite Foods, Inc., 1964-NMSC-048, 74 N.M. 55, 390 P.2d 437.\n\nCriminal sentences must be imposed as prescribed by statute.State v. Baros, 1968-NMSC-001, 78 N.M. 623, 435 P.2d 1005.\n\nUnless legislative intent indicates otherwise, criminal intent will be required.— Except where the legislature clearly indicates a desire to eliminate the requirement of criminal intent, criminal statutes will be construed in the light of the common law and criminal intent will be required, and failure to instruct on this required element will be considered jurisdictional.State v. Fuentes, 1973-NMCA-069, 85 N.M. 274, 511 P.2d 760, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 265, 511 P.2d 751.\n\nAct prohibited only by statute construed in light of common law.— When an act is prohibited and made punishable by statute only, the statute is to be construed in the light of the common law and the existence of a criminal intent is to be regarded as essential, although the terms of the statute do not require it.State v. Austin, 1969-NMCA-095, 80 N.M. 748, 461 P.2d 230;State v. Jordan, 1972-NMCA-033, 83 N.M. 571, 494 P.2d 984.\n\nRequirement of criminal intent is matter of construction.— Whether a criminal intent is to be regarded as essential is a matter of construction, to be determined from a consideration of the matters prohibited and the language of the statute, in the light of the common-law rule.State v. Jordan, 1972-NMCA-033, 83 N.M. 571, 494 P.2d 984.\n\nCriminal intent is required unless it clearly appears legislature intended otherwise.— The legislature may forbid the doing of an act and make its commission criminal, without regard to the intent with which such act is done; but in such case it must clearly appear from the act, from its language or clear inference, that such was the legislative intent.State v. Austin, 1969-NMCA-095, 80 N.M. 748, 461 P.2d 230.\n\nRequirement of criminal intent.— Intent is required unless it clearly appears that the legislature meant to eliminate intent as part of the offense.State v. Pedro, 1971-NMCA-145, 83 N.M. 212, 490 P.2d 470.\n\nIV. TAX STATUTES.\n\nOne provision not to destroy another.— The established rule of construction of a statute is that, if possible, it will be construed to give effect to all of its provisions so that one part will not destroy another.State ex rel. Maloney v. Neal, 1969-NMSC-095, 80 N.M. 460, 457 P.2d 708.\n\nGiving effect to all parts of a statute.— A statute should be construed, if possible, to give effect to all of its provisions and so that one part will not destroy another.Martinez v. Research Park, Inc., 1965-NMSC-146, 75 N.M. 672, 410 P.2d 200,overruled on other grounds,Sundance Mech. & Util. Corp. v. Atlas, 1990-NMSC-031, 109 N.M. 683, 789 P.2d 1250.\n\nMeaning and effect given to every part of statute.— An appellate court construes statutes so that meaning and effect will be given to every part thereof.State v. Herrera, 1974-NMSC-037, 86 N.M. 224, 522 P.2d 76.\n\nEach part construed to produce harmonious whole.— Particular words, phrases and provisions must be construed with reference to the leading idea or purpose derived from the whole statute. Thus, each part should be construed in connection with every other part so as to produce a harmonious whole.State ex rel. Maloney v. Neal, 1969-NMSC-095, 80 N.M. 460, 457 P.2d 708.\n\nStatutes construed in a manner so as to prevent absurdity.1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-61.\n\nStatutes construed so that application is not absurd.— It is fundamental that statutes will be construed so that their application will be neither absurd nor unreasonable.Midwest Video v. Campbell, 1969-NMSC-034, 80 N.M. 116, 452 P.2d 185.\n\nIntention to authorize a deduction must be clear.— The rule is that legislative intention to authorize a deduction must be clearly and unambiguously expressed in the statute.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Prop. Appraisal Dep't, 1971-NMCA-131, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.\n\nThe legislature is presumed to have used no surplus wordsand each word should have attributed to it some meaning not within the plain signification of other language found in the act.Cromer v. J.W. Jones Constr. Co., 1968-NMCA-027, 79 N.M. 179, 441 P.2d 219,overruled on other grounds bySchiller v. Southwest Air Rangers, Inc., 1975-NMSC-018, 87 N.M. 476, 535 P.2d 1327.\n\nNo part of statute rendered superfluous.— It is fundamental that a statute should be so construed that no word, clause, sentence provision or part thereof shall be rendered surplusage or superfluous.Cromer v. J.W. Jones Constr. Co., 1968-NMCA-027, 79 N.M. 179, 441 P.2d 219,overruled on other grounds bySchiller v. Southwest Air Rangers, Inc., 1975-NMSC-018, 87 N.M. 476, 535 P.2d 1327.\n\nAll parts of act construed together.— In statutory construction all parts of an act relating to the same subject matter are to be construed together.Kendrick v. Gackle Drilling Co., 1962-NMSC-127, 71 N.M. 113, 376 P.2d 176.\n\nAll of statute given effect.— In construing statute, effect is to be given to every clause and section of it, if possible.Butts v. Woods, 1888-NMSC-004, 4 N.M. (Gild.) 343, 16 P. 617.\n\nStatutes construed to prevent absurdity, and to favor public convenience.— Statutes will be construed in the most beneficial way which their language will permit to prevent absurdity, hardship or injustice; to favor public convenience, and to oppose all prejudice to public interests. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6479.\n\nAn appellate court will not construe statutesto achieve an absurd result or to defeat the intended object of the legislature.State v. Herrera, 1974-NMSC-037, 86 N.M. 224, 522 P.2d 76.\n\nPresumption in favor of validity and regularity of statutes.— Every presumption is to be indulged in favor of the validity and regularity of legislative enactments.City of Raton v. Sproule, 1967-NMSC-141, 78 N.M. 138, 429 P.2d 336.\n\nWhen statute's application absurd construe according to obvious spirit.— If the language of a statute renders its application absurd or unreasonable, it will be construed according to its obvious spirit or reason. But where the meaning of the language is plain, it must be given effect, and there is no room for construction.State v. Garcia, 1971-NMCA-186, 83 N.M. 490, 493 P.2d 975, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 473, 493 P.2d 958 (1972).\n\nIf the language of a statute renders its application absurd or unreasonable, it will be construed according to its obvious spirit or reason, but where the meaning of the language is plain, it must be given effect, and there is no room for construction.State v. Ortiz, 1967-NMCA-019, 78 N.M. 507, 433 P.2d 92.\n\nWhen tax statutes strictly construed.— Statutes imposing taxes and providing means for the collection of the same should be construed strictly insofar as they may operate to deprive the citizen of his property by summary proceedings or to impose penalties or forfeitures upon him; but otherwise tax laws ought to be construed with fairness, if not liberality, in order to carry out the intention of the legislature and further the important public interests which such statutes subserve.NBS Corp. v. Valdez, 1965-NMSC-027, 75 N.M. 379, 405 P.2d 224.\n\nWhen ambiguity exists statute construed against taxing authority.— Where an ambiguity or doubt exists as to the meaning or applicability of a tax statute, it should be construed most strongly against the taxing authority and in favor of those taxed.New Mexico Elec. Serv. Co. v. Jones, 1969-NMCA-111, 80 N.M. 791, 461 P.2d 924.\n\nStatute of exemption from taxation must receive a strict construction,and no claim of exemption should be sustained unless within the express letter or the necessary scope of the exempting clause.Gibbons & Reed Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1969-NMSC-096, 80 N.M. 462, 457 P.2d 710.\n\nTax and assessment contrasted.— An assessment is unlike a tax in that the proceeds must be expended in an improvement from which a benefit, clearly exceptive and plainly perceived, must enure to the property upon which it is imposed. There is a wide difference in law between a tax and an assessment. In the one case the taxes are assessed against the individual and become a charge upon his property generally. In the other, the assessment, being for benefits accruing to the specific property, becomes a charge only upon and against it, and liability for the charge is confined to the particular property benefited.Leigh v. Hertzmark, 1967-NMSC-064, 77 N.M. 789, 427 P.2d 668.\n\nFundamental law that statutes and regulations construed to make constitutional.— It is fundamental law that the courts will construe a statute, and for that matter a regulation, so as to make it constitutional and valid. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-85.\n\nProviso survives invalidity when disjunctive.— While it is the general rule that a proviso modifies or restricts only that part of a statute which immediately precedes it and therefore would fall when that part of the statute falls, there is an exception to this rule to the effect that the mere fact that a sentence begins \"provided\" does not of necessity make it a proviso and that it may, in fact, be used in the disjunctive and contain new matter rather than an exception to what has gone before. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-188.\n\nConstitutional provisions must receive a reasonable and liberal constructionto uphold the acts of the legislature to the extent that this can be done. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-85.\n\nStatutes construed as beneficial and favoring public convenience.— It is a well-recognized rule of construction that statutes should be construed in a beneficial way in order to prevent absurdity, hardship, injustice and so as to favor public convenience. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-246.\n\n\"Remedial and humanitarian\" statute is to be broadly construed,and exceptions thereto, in application, be narrowly construed. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-248.\n\nSpecific words control general words which follow.— Under well-settled rules of statutory construction, when general words are used, following the enumeration of specific classes of things, the general words are to be construed as applicable only to things of the same general nature as those enumerated. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-279, superseded by 2000 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 00-03 on other issues.\n\nMaxim \"expressio unius est exclusio alterius\" is only an aid.— The legal maxim \"expressio unius est exclusio alterius,\" while time honored, is only an aid to construction. It is not a rule of law, and in any event is of limited application. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-18.\n\nStatutes dealing with public assistance are to be liberally construedto carry out the intent and purpose of the legislation. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5631.\n\nWhen two constructions, court adopts constitutional one.— When a statute is before the court for construction, and the language of the act is reasonably susceptible to two constructions, one of which would render the act inoperative and in contravention of the constitution or law of the land, and the other would uphold the statute, it is the duty of the court to adopt the latter construction. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5878.",

If, after considering the text of a statute or rule in light of Sections 2 through 7 and Sections 18 and 19 of the Uniform Statute and Rules Construction Act, the context in which the statute or rule is applied and the aids to construction in Subsections A and B of this section, the meaning of the text or its application is uncertain, the following aids to construction may be considered in ascertaining the meaning of the text:\n\n(1) the circumstances that prompted the enactment or adoption of the statute or rule;\n\n(2) the purpose of a statute or rule as determined from the legislative or administrative history of the statute or rule; and\n\n(3) the history of other legislation on the same subject.\n\nHistory:Laws 1997, ch. 173, § 20.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 1997, ch. 173 § 22 made the Uniform Statute and Rule Construction Act effective July 1, 1997.\n\nDecisions of other jurisdictions.— Courts may consider other jurisdictions' interpretations of Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act to effectuate the purpose of uniformity with other states that have likewise adopted the uniform act.Corum v.

Nance, 1966-NMSC-207, 77 N.M. 39, 419 P.2d 242, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1039, 87 S. Ct. 1495, 18 L.

N.M. Fed'n of Teachers, 1998-NMSC-020, 125 N.M. 401, 962 P.2d 1236.\n\nConstruction not to be absurd, literal interpretation yields to intent.— The legislative intent must be given effect by adopting a construction which will not render the statute's application absurd or unreasonable and the court will not be bound by a literal interpretation of the words if such strict interpretation would defeat the intended object of the legislature.State v. Nance, 1966-NMSC-207, 77 N.M. 39, 419 P.2d 242, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1039, 87 S. Ct. 1495, 18 L.

Ed. 2d 605 (1967).\n\nEntire provision read to give effect to all parts.— Statutes are to be given effect as written, and where free from ambiguity, there is no room for construction. Where there is ambiguity, however, and meaning is not clear, resort may be had to construction and interpretation and, even then, intent is to be determined primarily from the language used, and the entire provision is to be read together so that all parts are given effect in arriving at the intent of the drafters and promulgators.Fort v.

Helman v. Gallegos, 1994-NMSC-023, 117 N.M. 346, 871 P.2d 1352.\n\nAct in violation of statute void, exception.— The general rule of law is that an act done in violation of a statutory prohibition is void and confers no right upon the wrongdoer; but this rule is subject to the qualification that when, upon a survey of the statute, its subject matter and the mischief sought to be prevented, it appears that the legislature intended otherwise, effect must be given to that intention.State ex rel. State Tax Comm'n v. Garcia, 1967-NMSC-098, 77 N.M. 703, 427 P.2d 230.\n\nStatutes are to be interpreted with reference to their manifest object,and \"if the language is susceptible of two constructions, one which will carry out and the other defeat such manifest object, it should receive the former construction.\"Martinez v.

Ortiz, 1967-NMCA-019, 78 N.M. 507, 433 P.2d 92.\n\nPresumption when one state adopts statute of another state.— Where one state adopts a statute of another state there is a presumption that it likewise adopts the construction of the statute by the courts of the state from which it was adopted.Gray v.

N.M. Prop. Appraisal Dep't, 1971-NMCA-124, 83 N.M. 505, 494 P.2d 167,aff'd, 1972-NMSC-006, 83 N.M. 445, 493 P.2d 411.\n\nCustom does not relieve party of clear-cut obligations of ordinance.Sanchez v.

Lee v. Hartman, 1961-NMSC-171, 69 N.M. 419, 367 P.2d 918.\n\nAscertainment of legislative intent.— The controlling consideration in construing a statute is ascertainment of the legislative intent, and such legislative intent is determined primarily from the language actually contained in the statute. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-65.\n\nMatter may be implied to effect intent.— The spirit, as well as the letter of the statute, must be respected; and where the whole context of a law demonstrates a particular intent in the legislature to effect a certain object, some degree of implication may be called in to aid that intent. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-75.\n\nFailure to disapprove of agency's interpretation is persuasive.— Where the legislature has met since the particular department placed its interpretation on a given statute, its failure to indicate that the administrative construction is not actually in accord with legislative intent is a persuasive argument that the legislative body approves of the administrative agency's construction. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-75.\n\nWhen statutes void.— A statute may be void for vagueness where no ascertainable legislative intent is revealed. It may be equally void where there is more than one reasonable construction possible but there is no means of determining which construction was intended by the legislature. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-32.\n\nEffect of construction prior to amendment.— When a statute has been construed and the legislature in amending the same substantially sets forth the section in language identical with that which has theretofore been construed, the legislature may be regarded as adopting the construction theretofore made. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-41.",
