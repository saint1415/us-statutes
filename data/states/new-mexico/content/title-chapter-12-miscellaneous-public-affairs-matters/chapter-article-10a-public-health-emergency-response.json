Reeb, 2021-NMSC-006.\n\nPublic health order was not ultra vires or arbitrary and capricious.— Where, following the secretary of the department of health's (secretary) reinstatement of a ban on indoor dining, pursuant to an emergency health order issued to combat the spread of the coronavirus in New Mexico, six food and drink establishments (real parties in interest) filed an application in the district court seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a preliminary and permanent injunction against governor Lujan Grisham and the secretary, claiming that the indoor dining ban is ultra vires and not enforceable and is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious, and where the district court issued a temporary restraining order restraining governor Lujan Grisham and the secretary from enforcing the restrictions imposed upon restaurants and breweries, and where petitioners filed an emergency petition for a writ of superintending control and stay of the TRO, the New Mexico supreme court, taking judicial notice of the serious health risks posed by COVID-19, a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, the disease's transmission within New Mexico, and the emergency orders issued by governor Lujan Grisham and the secretary, held that it was within the secretary's statutory authority to issue the public health order banning indoor dining, because the public health order does not infringe on the legislative branch by imposing through executive order substantive policy changes in an area of law reserved to the legislature, and the unique risks of indoor dining and the increased COVID-19 cases among New Mexico restaurant staff during the time period when indoor dining restrictions were relaxed show a real and substantial relation between the public health order's temporary prohibition and object of controlling and suppressing the spread of COVID-19.Lujan Grisham v. Romero, 2021-NMSC-009.\n\nAuthority to regulate private businesses during a public health emergency.— The Public Health Emergency Response Act, 12-10A-1 to 12-10A-19 NMSA 1978, provides a grant of authority to the governor to declare a state of public health emergency upon the occurrence of a public health emergency, which then authorizes the department of health, under the Public Health Act, 24-1-3 to 24-1-40 NMSA 1978, to order the closure of public places, including privately owned businesses generally open to the public, and to forbid large gatherings when necessary for the protection of the public, and therefore, when the governor of New Mexico, in 2020, declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the public health orders issued by the department of health, limiting mass gatherings and implementing other restrictions with the stated purpose of minimizing the spread and adverse impacts of COVID-19 in New Mexico, were statutorily authorized and a reasonable exercise of the police powers vested in the department of health.Governor's Authority during a Public Health or Other Emergency(3/23/20), Att'y Gen.

Reeb, 2021-NMSC-006.\n\nPublic health order was not ultra vires or arbitrary and capricious.— Where, following the secretary of the department of health's (secretary) reinstatement of a ban on indoor dining, pursuant to an emergency health order issued to combat the spread of the coronavirus in New Mexico, six food and drink establishments (real parties in interest) filed an application in the district court seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a preliminary and permanent injunction against governor Lujan Grisham and the secretary, claiming that the indoor dining ban is ultra vires and not enforceable and is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious, and where the district court issued a temporary restraining order restraining governor Lujan Grisham and the secretary from enforcing the restrictions imposed upon restaurants and breweries, and where petitioners filed an emergency petition for a writ of superintending control and stay of the TRO, the New Mexico supreme court, taking judicial notice of the serious health risks posed by COVID-19, a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, the disease's transmission within New Mexico, and the emergency orders issued by governor Lujan Grisham and the secretary, held that it was within the secretary's statutory authority to issue the public health order banning indoor dining, because the public health order does not infringe on the legislative branch by imposing through executive order substantive policy changes in an area of law reserved to the legislature, and the unique risks of indoor dining and the increased COVID-19 cases among New Mexico restaurant staff during the time period when indoor dining restrictions were relaxed show a real and substantial relation between the public health order's temporary prohibition and object of controlling and suppressing the spread of COVID-19.Lujan Grisham v.
