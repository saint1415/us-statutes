In such hearing, the agency shall have the burden of demonstrating a public need for its continued existence and the extent to which an amendment of the agency's basic statute may increase the efficiency of the administration or operation of the agency.\n\nB. In making its recommendation to the legislature, the legislative finance committee shall take into consideration all or applicable parts of the following:\n\n(1) the extent to which the agency has permitted qualified applicants to serve the public;\n\n(2) the extent to which the agency has operated in the public interest, and the extent to which its operation has been impeded or enhanced by existing statutes, procedures and practices and by budgetary, resources [resource] and personnel matters;\n\n(3) the extent to which the agency has recommended statutory changes to the legislature which would benefit the public as opposed to the persons it regulates;\n\n(4) the extent to which persons regulated by the agency have exercised control over the policies and actions of the agency and the extent to which the agency requires the persons it regulates to report to it concerning the impact of rules and decisions of the agency regarding improved service, economy of service and availability of service;\n\n(5) the extent to which persons regulated by the agency have been required to assess problems in their industry which affect the public;\n\n(6) the extent to which the agency has encouraged participation by the public in making its rules and decisions as opposed to participation solely by the persons it regulates;\n\n(7) the efficiency with which formal public complaints filed with the agency concerning persons subject to regulation have been processed to completion by the agency; and\n\n(8) the extent to which changes are necessary in the enabling laws of the agency to adequately comply with the above factors.\n\nC.
