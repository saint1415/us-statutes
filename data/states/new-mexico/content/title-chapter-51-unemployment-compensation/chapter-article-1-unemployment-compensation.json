      "text": "As a guide to the interpretation and application of this act, the public policy of this state is declared to be as follows: economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals and welfare of the people of this state. Involuntary unemployment is therefore a subject of general interest and concern which requires appropriate action by the legislature to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden which now so often falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker and his family. The achievement of social security requires protection against this greatest hazard of our economic life. This can be provided by encouraging employers to provide more stable employment and by the systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment to provide benefits for periods of unemployment, thus maintaining purchasing power and limiting the serious social consequences of poor relief assistance. The legislature, therefore, declares that in its considered judgment the public good, and the general welfare of the citizens of this state requires the enactment of this measure, for the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves to be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.\n\nHistory:Laws 1936 (S.S.), ch. 1, § 2; 1941 Comp., § 57-802; 1953 Comp., § 59-9-2.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The term \"this act,\" referred to in the first sentence, refers to Laws 1936 (S.S.), ch. 1, which is presently compiled as 51-1-1, 51-1-3, 51-1-7, 51-1-8, 51-1-18, 51-1-19, 51-1-33, 51-1-34, 51-1-36, 51-1-37, 51-1-38, 51-1-40 to 51-1-42, 51-1-50, 51-1-52 and 51-1-53 NMSA 1978.

      "heading": "Monetary computation of benefits; payment generally.",
      "text": "A. All benefits provided herein are payable from the unemployment compensation fund. All benefits shall be paid in accordance with rules prescribed by the secretary through employment offices or other agencies as the secretary approves by general rule.\n\nB. Weekly benefits shall be as follows:\n\n(1) an individual's \"weekly benefit amount\" is an amount equal to fifty-three and one-half percent of the average weekly wage for insured work paid to the individual in that quarter of the individual's base period in which total wages were highest. No benefit as so computed may be less than ten percent or more than fifty-three and one-half percent of the state's average weekly wage for all insured work. The state's average weekly wage shall be computed from all wages reported to the department from employing units in accordance with rules of the secretary for the period ending June 30 of each calendar year divided by the total number of covered employees divided by fifty-two, effective for the benefit years commencing on or after the first Sunday of the following calendar year. An individual is not eligible to receive benefits unless the individual has wages in at least two quarters of that individual's base period. For the purposes of this subsection, \"total wages\" means all remuneration for insured work, including commissions and bonuses and the cash value of all remuneration in a medium other than cash;\n\n(2) an eligible individual who is unemployed in any week during which the individual is in a continued claims status shall be paid, with respect to the week, a benefit in an amount equal to the individual's weekly benefit amount, less that part of the wages, if any, or earnings from self-employment, payable to the individual with respect to such week that is in excess of one-fifth of the individual's weekly benefit amount. For purposes of this subsection only, \"wages\" includes all remuneration for services actually performed in a week for which benefits are claimed, vacation pay for a period for which the individual has a definite return-to-work date, wages in lieu of notice and back pay for loss of employment but does not include payments through a court for time spent in jury service;\n\n(3) notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an eligible individual who, pursuant to a plan financed in whole or in part by a base-period employer of the individual, is receiving a governmental or other pension, retirement pay, annuity or any other similar periodic payment that is based on the previous work of the individual and who is unemployed with respect to any week ending subsequent to April 9, 1981 shall be paid with respect to the week, in accordance with rules prescribed by the secretary, compensation equal to the individual's weekly benefit amount reduced, but not below zero, by the prorated amount of the pension, retirement pay, annuity or other similar periodic payment that exceeds the percentage contributed to the plan by the eligible individual. The maximum benefit amount payable to the eligible individual shall be an amount not more than twenty-six times the individual's reduced weekly benefit amount. If payments referred to in this section are being received by an individual under the federal Social Security Act, the division shall take into account the individual's contribution and make no reduction in the weekly benefit amount;\n\n(4) in the case of a lump-sum payment of a pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity or other similar payment by a base-period employer that is based on the previous work of the individual, the payment shall be allocated, in accordance with rules prescribed by the secretary, and shall reduce the amount of unemployment compensation paid, but not below zero, in accordance with Paragraph (3) of this subsection; and\n\n(5) the retroactive payment of a pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity or any other similar periodic payment as provided in Paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection attributable to weeks during which an individual has claimed or has been paid unemployment compensation shall be allocated to those weeks and shall reduce the amount of unemployment compensation for those weeks, but not below zero, by an amount equal to the prorated amount of the pension. Any overpayment of unemployment compensation benefits resulting from the application of the provisions of this paragraph shall be recovered from the claimant in accordance with the provisions of Section 51-1-38 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. An individual otherwise eligible for benefits shall be paid for each week of unemployment, in addition to the amount payable under Subsection B of this section, the sum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each unemancipated child under the age of eighteen, up to a maximum of two and subject to the maximum stated in Subsection D of this section, of the individual who is in fact dependent upon and wholly or mainly supported by the individual, including:\n\n(1) a child in the individual's custody pending the adjudication of a petition filed by the individual for the adoption of the child in a court of competent jurisdiction; or\n\n(2) a child for whom the individual, under a decree or order from a court of competent jurisdiction, is required to contribute to the child's support and for whom no other person is receiving allowances under the Unemployment Compensation Law if the child is domiciled within the United States or its territories or possessions, the payment to be withheld and paid pursuant to Section 51-1-37.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nD. Dependency benefits shall not exceed fifty percent of the individual's weekly benefit rate. The amount of dependency benefits determined as of the beginning of an individual's benefit year shall not be reduced for the duration of the benefit year, but this provision does not prevent the transfer of dependents' benefits from one spouse to another in accordance with this subsection. If both the husband and wife receive benefits with respect to a week of unemployment, only one of them is entitled to a dependency allowance with respect to a child. The division shall prescribe standards as to who may receive a dependency allowance when both the husband and wife are eligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits. Dependency benefits shall not be paid unless the individual submits documentation satisfactory to the division establishing the existence of the claimed dependent. If the provisions of this subsection are satisfied, an otherwise eligible individual who has been appointed guardian of a dependent child by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be paid dependency benefits.\n\nE. An otherwise eligible individual is entitled during any benefit year to a total amount of benefits equal to whichever is the lesser of twenty-six times the individual's weekly benefit amount, plus any dependency benefit amount pursuant to Subsections C and D of this section, or sixty percent of the individual's wages for insured work paid during the individual's base period.\n\nF. A benefit as determined in Subsection B or C of this section, if not a multiple of one dollar ($1.00), shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of one dollar ($1.00).\n\nG. The secretary may prescribe rules to provide for the payment of benefits that are due and payable to the legal representative, dependents, relatives or next of kin of claimants since deceased. These rules need not conform with the laws governing successions, and the payment shall be deemed a valid payment to the same extent as if made under a formal administration of the succession of the claimant.\n\nH. The division, on its own initiative, may reconsider a monetary determination whenever it is determined that an error in computation or identity has occurred or that wages of the claimant pertinent to such determination but not considered have been newly discovered or that the benefits have been allowed or denied on the basis of misrepresentation of fact, but no redetermination shall be made after one year from the date of the original monetary determination. Notice of a redetermination shall be given to all interested parties and shall be subject to an appeal in the same manner as the original determination. In the event that an appeal involving an original monetary determination is pending at the time a redetermination is issued, the appeal, unless withdrawn, shall be treated as an appeal from redetermination.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 59-9-3, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 213, § 1; 1977, ch. 321, § 1; 1979, ch. 280, § 12; 1981, ch. 354, § 1; 1983, ch. 199, § 1; 1985, ch. 31, § 1; 1990, ch. 18, § 1; 1991, ch. 122, § 2; 1993, ch. 209, § 1; 1998, ch. 91, § 1; 2000, ch. 3, § 1; 2000, ch. 7, § 1; 2003, ch. 47, § 1; 1978 Comp., § 51-1-5, repealed and reenacted by Laws 2003, ch. 47, § 8; 2005, ch. 3, § 1; 2007, ch. 137, § 1; 2009, ch. 97, § 1; 2010, ch. 55, § 1; 2011, ch. 184, § 1.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1969, ch. 213, § 1, repealed former 59-9-3, 1953 Comp., relating to benefits, and enacted a new 59-9-3, 1953 Comp.\n\nLaws 2003, ch. 47, § 8 repealed Laws 1969, ch. 213, § 1 and enacted a new section.

No such rule shall conflict with Subsection A of Section 51-1-4 NMSA 1978;\n\n(3) is able to work and is available for work and is actively seeking permanent full-time work or part-time work in accordance with Subsection I of Section 51-1-42 NMSA 1978 and in accordance with the terms, conditions and hours common in the occupation or business in which the individual is seeking work, except that the secretary may, by rule, waive this requirement for individuals who are on temporary layoff status from their regular employment with an assurance from their employers that the layoff shall not exceed four weeks or who have an express offer in writing of substantially full-time work that will begin within a period not exceeding four weeks;\n\n(4) has been unemployed for a waiting period of one week. A week shall not be counted as a week of unemployment for the purposes of this paragraph:\n\n(a) unless it occurs within the benefit year that includes the week with respect to which the individual claims payment of benefits;\n\n(b) if benefits have been paid with respect thereto; and\n\n(c) unless the individual was eligible for benefits with respect thereto as provided in this section and Section 51-1-7 NMSA 1978, except for the requirements of this subsection and of Subsection D of Section 51-1-7 NMSA 1978;\n\n(5) has been paid wages in at least two quarters of the individual's base period;\n\n(6) has reported to an office of the division in accordance with the rules of the secretary for the purpose of an examination and review of the individual's availability for and search for work, for employment counseling, referral and placement and for participation in a job finding or employability training and development program. An individual shall not be denied benefits under this section for any week that the individual is participating in a job finding or employability training and development program; and\n\n(7) participates in reemployment services, such as job search assistance services, if the division determines that the individual is likely to exhaust regular benefits and needs reemployment services pursuant to a profiling system established by the division, unless the division determines that:\n\n(a) the individual has completed such services; or\n\n(b) there is justifiable cause for the individual's failure to participate in the services.\n\nB. A benefit year as provided in Section 51-1-4 NMSA 1978 and Subsection P of Section 51-1-42 NMSA 1978 may be established; provided an individual may not receive benefits in a benefit year unless, subsequent to the beginning of the immediately preceding benefit year during which the individual received benefits, the individual performed service in \"employment\", as defined in Subsection F of Section 51-1-42 NMSA 1978, and earned remuneration for such service in an amount equal to at least five times the individual's weekly benefit amount.\n\nC. Benefits based on service in employment defined in Paragraph (8) of Subsection F of Section 51-1-42 and Section 51-1-43 NMSA 1978 are to be paid in the same amount, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as compensation payable on the basis of other services subject to the Unemployment Compensation Law; except that:\n\n(1) benefits based on services performed in an instructional, research or principal administrative capacity for an educational institution shall not be paid for any week of unemployment commencing during the period between two successive academic years or terms or, when an agreement provides for a similar period between two regular but not successive terms, during such period or during a period of paid sabbatical leave provided for in the individual's contract, to any individual if the individual performs such services in the first of such academic years or terms and if there is a contract or a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform services in any such capacity for any educational institution in the second of such academic years or terms;\n\n(2) benefits based on services performed for an educational institution other than in an instructional, research or principal administrative capacity shall not be paid for any week of unemployment commencing during a period between two successive academic years or terms if the services are performed in the first of such academic years or terms and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform services for any educational institution in the second of such academic years or terms. If compensation is denied to an individual under this paragraph and the individual was not offered an opportunity to perform such services for the educational institution for the second of such academic years or terms, the individual shall be entitled to a retroactive payment of benefits for each week for which the individual filed a claim and certified for benefits in accordance with the rules of the division and for which benefits were denied solely by reason of this paragraph;\n\n(3) benefits shall be denied to any individual for any week that commences during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess if the individual performs any services described in Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection in the period immediately before such period of vacation or holiday recess and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform any such services in the period immediately following such vacation period or holiday recess;\n\n(4) benefits shall not be payable on the basis of services specified in Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection during the periods specified in Paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection to any individual who performed such services in or to or on behalf of an educational institution while in the employ of a state or local governmental educational service agency or other governmental entity or nonprofit organization; and\n\n(5) for the purpose of this subsection, to the extent permitted by federal law, \"reasonable assurance\" means a reasonable expectation of employment in a similar capacity in the second of such academic years or terms based upon a consideration of all relevant factors, including the historical pattern of reemployment in such capacity, a reasonable anticipation that such employment will be available and a reasonable notice or understanding that the individual will be eligible for and offered employment in a similar capacity.\n\nD. Paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Subsection C of this section shall apply to services performed for all educational institutions, public or private, for profit or nonprofit, which are operated in this state or subject to an agreement for coverage under the Unemployment Compensation Law of this state, unless otherwise exempt by law.\n\nE. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section or Section 51-1-7 NMSA 1978, no otherwise eligible individual is to be denied benefits for any week because the individual is in training with the approval of the division nor is the individual to be denied benefits by reason of application of provisions in Paragraph (3) of Subsection A of this section or Paragraph (3) of Subsection A of Section 51-1-7 NMSA 1978 with respect to any week in which the individual is in training with the approval of the division. The secretary shall provide, by rule, standards for approved training and the conditions for approving training for claimants, including any training approved or authorized for approval pursuant to Section 236(a)(1) and (2) of the federal Trade Act of 1974, as amended, or required to be approved as a condition for certification of the state's Unemployment Compensation Law by the United States secretary of labor.\n\nF. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, benefits shall not be payable on the basis of services performed by an alien unless such alien is an individual who was lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time the services were performed, was lawfully present for the purposes of performing the services or was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time the services were performed, including an alien who was lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of Section 212(d)(5) of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act; provided that:\n\n(1) any information required of individuals applying for benefits to determine their eligibility for benefits under this subsection shall be uniformly required from all applicants for benefits; and\n\n(2) an individual shall not be denied benefits because of the individual's alien status except upon a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nG. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, benefits shall not be paid to any individual on the basis of any services substantially all of which consist of participating in sports or athletic events or training or preparing to so participate for any week that commences during the period between two successive sport seasons, or similar periods, if the individual performed the services in the first of such seasons, or similar periods, and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the services in the latter of such seasons or similar periods.\n\nH. Students who are enrolled in a full-time course schedule in an educational or training institution or program, other than those persons in an approved vocational training program in accordance with Subsection E of this section, shall not be eligible for unemployment benefits unless the individual can demonstrate to the division's satisfaction that the individual is able, available and actively seeking full- or part-time work in accordance with rules prescribed by the secretary.\n\nI. As used in this subsection, \"seasonal ski employee\" means an employee who has not worked for a ski area operator for more than six consecutive months of the previous twelve months or nine of the previous twelve months. An employee of a ski area operator who has worked for a ski area operator for six consecutive months of the previous twelve months or nine of the previous twelve months shall not be considered a seasonal ski employee. The following benefit eligibility conditions apply to a seasonal ski employee:\n\n(1) except as provided in Paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, a seasonal ski employee employed by a ski area operator on a regular seasonal basis shall be ineligible for a week of unemployment benefits that commences during a period between two successive ski seasons unless the individual establishes to the satisfaction of the secretary that the individual is available for and is making an active search for permanent full-time work;\n\n(2) a seasonal ski employee who has been employed by a ski area operator during two successive ski seasons shall be presumed to be unavailable for permanent new work during a period after the second successive ski season that the individual was employed as a seasonal ski employee; and\n\n(3) the presumption described in Paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not arise as to any seasonal ski employee who has been employed by the same ski area operator during two successive ski seasons and has resided continuously for at least twelve successive months and continues to reside in the county in which the ski area facility is located.\n\nJ. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an otherwise eligible individual shall not be denied benefits for any week by reason of the application of Paragraph (3) of Subsection A of this section because the individual is before any court of the United States or any state pursuant to a lawfully issued summons to appear for jury duty.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 59-9-4, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 213, § 2; 1971, ch. 209, § 1; 1977, ch. 321, § 2; 1978, ch. 165, § 1; 1979, ch. 280, § 13; 1981, ch. 354, § 2; 1982, ch. 41, § 2; 1983, ch. 199, § 2; 1984, ch. 45, § 1; 1987, ch. 63, § 1; 1987, ch. 302, § 1; 1988, ch. 130, § 1; 1990, ch. 18, § 2; 1991, ch. 122, § 3; 1993, ch. 209, § 2; 1995, ch. 196, § 1; 2000, ch. 3, § 2; 2000, ch. 7, § 2; 2003, ch. 47, § 2; repealed and reenacted by Laws 2003, ch. 47, § 9; 2005, ch. 3, § 2; 2011, ch. 184, § 2.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1969, ch. 213, § 1, repealed former 59-9-4, 1953 Comp., relating to benefit eligibility condition, and enacted a new 59-9-4, 1953 Comp.\n\nLaws 2007, ch. 137, § 6 repealed Laws 2005, ch. 3, § 7 effective July 1, 2007.

No individual shall receive benefits until the division has contacted the former employer and determined whether the individual left the employment voluntarily; provided, however, that a person shall not be denied benefits under this paragraph:\n\n(a) solely on the basis of pregnancy or the termination of pregnancy;\n\n(b) because of domestic abuse evidenced by medical documentation, legal documentation or a sworn statement from the claimant; or\n\n(c) if the person voluntarily left work to relocate because of a spouse, who is in the military service of the United States or the New Mexico national guard, receiving permanent change of station orders, activation orders or unit deployment orders;\n\n(2) if it is determined by the division that the individual has been discharged for misconduct connected with the individual's employment; or\n\n(3) if it is determined by the division that the individual has failed without good cause either to apply for available, suitable work when so directed or referred by the division or to accept suitable work when offered.\n\nB. In determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual pursuant to Paragraph (3) of Subsection A of this section, the division shall consider the degree of risk involved to the individual's health, safety and morals, the individual's physical fitness, prior training, approved training, experience, prior earnings, length of unemployment and prospects for securing local work in the individual's customary occupation and the distance of available work from the individual's residence. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Unemployment Compensation Law, no work shall be deemed suitable and benefits shall not be denied under the Unemployment Compensation Law to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions:\n\n(1) if the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout or other labor dispute;\n\n(2) if the wages, hours or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality; or\n\n(3) if, as a condition of being employed, the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organizations.\n\nC. An individual shall be disqualified for, and shall not be eligible to receive, benefits for any week with respect to which the division finds that the individual's unemployment is due to a labor dispute at the factory, establishment or other premises at which the individual is or was last employed; provided that this subsection shall not apply if it is shown to the satisfaction of the division that:\n\n(1) the individual is not participating in or directly interested in the labor dispute; and\n\n(2) the individual does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the labor dispute, there were members employed at the premises at which the labor dispute occurs, any of whom are participating in or directly interested in the dispute; provided that if in any case separate branches of work that are commonly conducted in separate businesses in separate premises are conducted in separate departments of the same premises, each such department shall, for the purposes of this subsection, be deemed to be a separate factory, establishment or other premises.\n\nD. An individual shall be disqualified for, and shall not be eligible to receive, benefits for any week with respect to which, or a part of which, the individual has received or is seeking, through any agency other than the division, unemployment benefits under an unemployment compensation law of another state or of the United States; provided that if the appropriate agency of such other state or of the United States finally determines that the individual is not entitled to such unemployment benefits, this disqualification shall not apply.\n\nE. A disqualification pursuant to Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection A of this section shall continue for the duration of the individual's unemployment and until the individual has earned wages in bona fide employment other than self-employment, as provided by rule of the secretary, in an amount equivalent to five times the individual's weekly benefit otherwise payable. A disqualification pursuant to Paragraph (3) of Subsection A of this section shall include the week the failure occurred and shall continue for the duration of the individual's unemployment and until the individual has earned wages in bona fide employment other than self-employment, as provided by rule of the secretary, in an amount equivalent to five times the individual's weekly benefit amount otherwise payable; provided that no more than one such disqualification shall be imposed upon an individual for failure to apply for or accept the same position, or a similar position, with the same employer, except upon a determination by the division of disqualification pursuant to Subsection C of this section.\n\nF. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"domestic abuse\" means that term as defined in Section 40-13-2 NMSA 1978; and\n\n(2) \"employment\" means employment by the individual's last employer as defined by rules of the secretary.\n\nHistory:Laws 1936 (S.S.), ch. 1, § 5; 1939, ch. 175, § 3; 1941 Comp., § 57-805; Laws 1941, ch. 205, § 3; 1943, ch. 103, § 3; 1953 Comp., § 59-9-5; Laws 1953, ch. 121, § 3; 1975, ch. 351, § 1; 1977, ch. 321, § 3; 1979, ch. 280, § 14; 1981, ch. 354, § 3; 1983, ch. 199, § 3; 1991, ch. 122, § 4; 2003, ch. 47, § 3; 2003, ch. 47, § 10; 2005, ch. 3, § 3; 2005, ch. 255, § 1; 2011, ch. 184, § 3.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 2003, ch. 47, § 10 repealed Laws 1969, ch. 213, § 5 as amended by Laws 2003, ch. 47, § 3 and enacted a new 51-1-7 NMSA 1978. Laws 2003, ch. 47, § 15 provided that the effective date of Laws 2003, ch. 47, §§ 8 through 12 was the earliest of the following: 1) June 30, 2007; or 2) the date that the unemployment compensation fund is less than three and three-fourths percent of total payrolls pursuant to the computation provided in Paragraph (1) of Subsection I of 51-1-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nLaws 2007, ch. 137, § 6 repealed Laws 2005, ch. 3, § 8 effective July 1, 2007. Laws 2005, ch. 3, § 8 would have repealed and reenacted this section, however it was repealed prior to taking effect.\n\nThe 2011 amendment,effective July 1, 2011, in Subsection B, eliminated full-time students from potential qualification for unemployment benefits.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2011, ch. 184, § 6 provided that Laws 2011, ch. 184, § 3 apply to benefit years beginning on or after July 1, 2011.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added Subsection A(1)(c).\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective March 19, 2003, rewrote the section and added Subsections E and F.\n\nLaws 2003, ch. 47, § 15 provided that the effective date of Laws 2003, ch. 47, §§ 8 through 12 was the earliest of the following: 1) June 30, 2007; or 2) the date that the unemployment compensation fund is less than three and three-fourths percent of total payrolls pursuant to the computation provided in Paragraph (1) of Subsection I of 51-1-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe compiler was informed that the event described in Laws 2003, ch, 47, § 15 occurred prior to the enactment of the 2005 amendment.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective April 3, 1991, substituted \"division\" for \"department\" throughout the section and \"secretary\" for \"department\" in Subsections A, B and C; in both Subsections A and B, added the first full sentences and deleted \"insured work or\" following \"earned wages in\" in the final sentence; and deleted \"insured work or such\" following \"earned wages in\" in the first full sentence in Subsection C.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION\n\nSupreme court is clearly committed to liberal interpretationof the Unemployment Compensation Act, so as to provide sustenance to those who are unemployed through no fault of their own and who are willing and ready to work if given the opportunity.Wilson v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-085, 74 N.M. 3, 389 P.2d 855.\n\nNo right of reconsideration after decision rendered.— After the commission (now division) has rendered its decision it has exercised the express power conferred by the act upon it. No right of reconsideration remains.Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1967-NMSC-182, 78 N.M. 398, 432 P.2d 109.\n\nDeputy limited to making and submitting findings to division.— The power of decision, under former section dealing with payment of benefits in labor dispute situations, is in the commission (now division), and the deputy's function is limited to making and submitting his findings to it.Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1967-NMSC-182, 78 N.M. 398, 432 P.2d 109.\n\nDivision quasi-judicial in nature.— The express power granted the commission (now division) by the legislature is quasi-judicial in its nature and authorizes the commission (division) to decide issues submitted under the labor dispute provisions of this section.Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1967-NMSC-182, 78 N.M. 398, 432 P.2d 109.\n\nThe term \"employment\", as used in Subsection A.— Because the determination of benefits rests upon a claimant's base-period employment, the term \"employment\", as used in Subsection A (now A(1)), logically can refer only to employment during which base-period wages were earned.Lopez v. Employment Sec. Div., 1990-NMSC-102, 111 N.M 104, 802 P.2d 9.\n\nOne-day absence from temporary work assignment.— Where claimant had qualified for benefits using the base-period employment with the job from which he had been laid off and remained eligible to receive benefits so long as he continued to satisfy conditions of eligibility each week, which included reporting any wages earned through temporary work assignments, claimant's one-day absence from a temporary work assignment did not provide a legal basis for disqualification from benefits under Subsection A (now A(1)).Bradley v. New Mexico Dep't of Labor Emp't Sec. Div., 1991-NMSC-024, 111 N.M. 524, 807 P.2d 222.\n\nStandard on review by trial court.— The standard to be applied by a trial court in reviewing a decision of the division is, if the court determines that the findings are supported by substantial evidence, those findings are binding on the district court. However, should the district court determine that they are not so supported, the district court must make its own findings from the evidence presented.Donovan v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1982-NMSC-008, 97 N.M. 293, 639 P.2d 580.\n\nII. VOLUNTARY TERMINATION\n\n\"Voluntary\" requirementof the Unemployment Compensation Law is clear and unambiguous, and should be accorded its ordinary meaning.LeMon v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1976-NMSC-064, 89 N.M. 549, 555 P.2d 372.\n\nLeaving employment to attend school deemed voluntary.— Leaving one's employment to attend school is generally regarded to be a voluntary leaving without good cause related to the employment.Phelps Dodge Corp. v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1983-NMSC-068, 100 N.M. 246, 669 P.2d 255.\n\nVoluntary leaving disqualification not applicable to strikers.— The terms \"leaving work\" or \"left his work\" as used in unemployment compensation laws refer only to a severance of the employment relation and do not include a temporary interruption in the performance of services. Strikers who have temporarily interrupted their employment because of a labor dispute have not been deemed to have terminated the employment relationship and the voluntary leaving disqualification has no application to them.Albuquerque-Phoenix Express, Inc. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1975-NMSC-069, 88 N.M. 596, 544 P.2d 1161.\n\nWhere claimant was discharged pursuant to mandatory retirement plan,it was held he did not leave his employment on a voluntary basis, and was entitled to the benefits of the unemployment compensation laws, and, furthermore, the employer cannot be relieved of the charges on its experience rating account.Duval Corp. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1972-NMSC-007, 83 N.M. 447, 493 P.2d 413.\n\nVoluntary abandonment of employment not established.— Since the employee, suffering from a debilitating illness, had taken steps to remain employed by applying for transfers, workers' compensation, and disability, she did not abandon her employment as a matter of law.Fitzhugh v. New Mexico Dep't of Labor, 1996-NMSC-044, 122 N.M. 173, 922 P.2d 555.\n\nIII. GOOD FAITH\n\nGood cause is an objective measureof real, substantial and reasonable circumstances which would cause the average able and qualified worker to quit gainful employment.Molenda v. Thomsen, 1989-NMSC-022, 108 N.M. 380, 772 P.2d 1303.\n\nGood cause includes the concept of good faith;a genuine desire to work and be self-supporting absent fraud.Molenda v. Thomsen, 108 N.M. 380, 1989-NMSC-022, 772 P.2d 1303.\n\n\"Good cause\", proper notice requirement met.— Since the requisite causal connection between claimant's secretarial duties at work and her lower-back physical condition was established through direct uncontroverted medical testimony, and it was undisputed that claimant had asked for, and been categorically denied, any reassignment before tendering her resignation, \"the good cause\" demands of this section were met and her disqualification for unemployment benefits was improper.Kramer v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Div., 1992-NMSC-071, 114 N.M. 714, 845 P.2d 808.\n\nFailure to pay regularly as reason for quitting.— When an employer consistently fails to provide paychecks on established paydays to his or her employee, the employee has good cause to voluntarily quit employment.Randolph v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1989-NMSC-031, 108 N.M. 441, 774 P.2d 435.\n\nReligious harassment.— Employee who voluntarily terminated her employment was not subjected to unsuitable work conditions rising to the level of religious harassment, where she had previously worked for her employer, who conducted daily Bible study classes, and she was aware of the religious beliefs of her employer and how those religious beliefs affected the work environment.Randolph v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1989-NMSC-031, 108 N.M. 441, 774 P.2d 435.\n\nReduced hours and long commute are \"personal\" reasons for termination.— Reduced hours and a commute to the job that the worker considers excessive are \"personal\" reasons, and not \"good cause\" for termination under Subsection A (now A(1)).Begay v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1983-NMSC-106, 100 N.M. 529, 673 P.2d 506.\n\nCircumstances leaving no alternative to leaving employment.— Good cause is established when an individual faces compelling and necessitous circumstances of such magnitude that there is no alternative to leaving gainful employment.Molenda v. Thomsen, 108 N.M. 380, 1989-NMSC-022, 772 P.2d 1303.\n\nEmployee's circumstances were not so compelling and necessitous that she had no alternative to quitting her job as a legal secretary, where she voluntarily quit work immediately after her employer reprimanded her in a loud voice and she did not attempt to resolve the problem with him prior to quitting, although he had been receptive to her past expressed concerns and demonstrated a willingness to correct any problems.Molenda v. Thomsen, 1989-NMSC-022, 108 N.M. 380, 772 P.2d 1303.\n\nIV. MISCONDUCT\n\nMisconduct is conduct evincing such willful or wanton disregardof an employer's interests as is found in deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of his employee, or in carelessness or negligence of such degree or recurrence as to manifest equal culpability, wrongful intent or evil design or to show an intentional and substantial disregard of the employer's interests or of the employee's duties and obligations to his employer. Mere inefficiency, unsatisfactory conduct, failure in good performance as the result of inability or incapacity, inadvertencies or ordinary negligence in isolated instances, or good faith errors in judgment or discretion are not misconduct.Mitchell v. Lovington Good Samaritan Ctr., Inc., 1976-NMSC-071, 89 N.M. 575, 555 P.2d 696;Donovan v. N.M. Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1982-NMSC-008, 97 N.M. 293, 639 P.2d 580.\n\nDisqualifying misconduct.— To be disqualifying, misconduct must evince a willful or wanton disregard for the employer's interests and must significantly infringe upon legitimate employer expectations.Otero v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Div., 1990-NMSC-007, 109 N.M. 412, 785 P.2d 1031.\n\n\"Misconduct\" is limited to conductin which employees bring about their own unemployment by such callousness and deliberate or wanton misbehavior that they have given up any reasonable expectation of receiving unemployment benefits.Fitzhugh v. New Mexico Dep't of Labor, 1996-NMSC-044, 122 N.M. 173, 922 P.2d 555.\n\nTotal of separate acts may be misconduct.— Although each separate incident may not be sufficient in itself to constitute misconduct, taken in totality conduct may deviate sufficiently to classify it as misconduct. Donovan v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1982-NMSC-008, 97 N.M. 293, 639 P.2d 580.\n\nTermination for single incident following prior warnings.— Termination for a series of incidents which, taken together, may constitute \"misconduct\" is distinguishable from termination for a single incident following one or more corrective action notices. In the latter event, the \"last straw\" which leads to termination must demonstrate a willful or wanton disregard for the employer's interests for unemployment benefits to be denied.Rodman v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1988-NMSC-089, 107 N.M. 758, 764 P.2d 1316.\n\nThe \"totality of circumstances\" is relevant in contexts other than discharge after the accumulation of a series of minor incidents. The \"totality of circumstances,\" such as provided by the employee's past conduct and previous reprimands, may also be used to evaluate whether the employee acted with willful or wanton disregard of the employer's interests on the occasion (i.e., the \"last straw\") that precipitated his or her termination.Rodman v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1988-NMSC-089, 107 N.M. 758, 764 P.2d 1316.\n\nDetermination of misconduct not dependent on proof admissible in criminal trial.— Although the same act constituting grounds of misconduct on the job may also be a criminal act, determination of misconduct in a benefits hearing does not depend upon proof admissible in a criminal trial.Warren v. Employment Sec. Dep't, 1986-NMSC-061, 104 N.M. 518, 724 P.2d 227.\n\nFor unemployment compensation purposes, no distinction between \"suspension\" and \"discharge\" for misconduct.— For the purposes of unemployment compensation, there is no distinction between \"discharge for misconduct\" and \"suspension without pay for misconduct\" since the employee is performing no services and no wages are payable to him, and therefore he is unemployed under the definition of \"unemployment\" in Section 51-1-42 I NMSA 1978.Warren v. Employment Sec. Dep't, 1986-NMSC-061, 104 N.M. 518, 724 P.2d 227.\n\nChronic absenteeism may be \"misconduct\".— Persistent or chronic absenteeism, at least where the absences are without notice or excuse, and are continued in the face of warnings by the employer, constitutes willful \"misconduct\" within Subsection B (now A(2)).Chavez v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1982-NMSC-077, 98 N.M. 462, 649 P.2d 1375.\n\nDischarge for absenteeism must be preceded by warnings.— Any discharge based on inadequate excuses for missing work must be preceded by an adequate warning by the employer or his authorized representative that such behavior will not be tolerated.Chavez v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1982-NMSC-077, 98 N.M. 462, 649 P.2d 1375.\n\nViolation of rule on reporting absence not misconduct.— The employee's violation of a company policy that required her to notify her employer on a daily basis of her absence from work was not misconduct sufficient to warrant denial of unemployment benefits.Fitzhugh v. New Mexico Dep't of Labor, 1996-NMSC-044, 122 N.M. 173, 922 P.2d 555.\n\nRefusal to redye tinted hair held not misconduct.— Fast-food restaurant employee's refusal to redye her purple-tinted hair did not rise to the level of misconduct, where there was no evidence that the color of her hair significantly affected business, and the restaurant had received no customer complaints regarding the color of her hair.It's Burger Time, Inc. v. New Mexico Dep't of Labor Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1989-NMSC-008, 108 N.M. 175, 769 P.2d 88.\n\nSubstantial evidence supported denial of benefits for misconduct.—Warren v. Employment Sec. Dep't, 1986-NMSC-061, 104 N.M. 518, 724 P.2d 227.\n\nSubstantial evidence to support denial of benefits for misconduct.— Where employee was dismissed for presence of alcohol in a urine test, but the employer presented no evidence regarding the testing and collection procedures, and there was no corroborating evidence of intoxication, employee was not dismissed for good cause and was eligible to receive benefits.Mississippi Potash, Inc. v. Lemon, 2003-NMCA-014, 133 N.M. 128, 61 P.3d 837.\n\nDischarge for misconduct determination supported by substantial evidence.— A discharged village employee who had worked as an independent agent of the state department of motor vehicles was properly disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation benefits where evidence clearly showed that the employee had altered paperwork and collected money from customers in excess of that shown owing on altered documents sent to the department of motor vehicles.Hinojosa v. State ex rel. Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1986-NMCA-118, 105 N.M. 212, 730 P.2d 1194.\n\nThere was substantial evidence to support a finding of misconduct in failing to report for overtime work at 4:30 a.m., where, although there was testimony from the discharged employees that they were confused about the overtime issue, there was also testimony from the night-shift supervisor that his orders directing the employees to report were explicit and not confusing.Trujillo v. Employment Sec. Dep't, 1987-NMCA-008, 105 N.M. 467, 734 P.2d 245.\n\nClaimant's conduct in entering his employer's store at 3:26 a.m. constituted a willful and wanton violation of a reasonable and known rule prohibiting managerial employees from opening or closing the store unaccompanied by another employee, and claimant's discharge for such conduct disqualified him from receiving benefits.Sanchez v. New Mexico Dep't of Labor, Emp't Sec. Div., 1990-NMSC-016, 109 N.M. 447, 786 P.2d 674.\n\nUnsatisfactory job performance.— In order to deny benefits in cases involving only unsatisfactory job performance, an employer must demonstrate strict compliance with its progressive discipline policies to establish willful misconduct.Chicharello v. Employment Sec. Div., 1996-NMSC-077, 122 N.M. 635, 930 P.2d 170.\n\nMisconduct held insufficient to deny benefits.— One incident of an office clerk's refusing to wear a smock while assisting store cashiers is not sufficient \"misconduct\" to deny benefits under Subsection B (now A(2)).Alonzo v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1984-NMSC-099, 101 N.M. 770, 689 P.2d 286.\n\nV. AVAILABILITY\n\nProspective employee who is unable to provide himself with transportation to work,even though it be through no fault of his own, is not available for work within the meaning of the statute.Moya v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1969-NMSC-022, 80 N.M. 39, 450 P.2d 925.\n\nRefusal of insurance carrier to provide insurance.— Claimant was not disqualified from receiving benefits where the sole reason for his termination was the refusal of the employer's insurance carrier to provide insurance, and not claimant's misrepresentations of his driving record on his application for employment.Otero v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Div., 1990-NMSC-007, 109 N.M. 412, 785 P.2d 1031.\n\nOne who restricts willingness to accept employment not available.— The claimant has restricted his work to daytime employment, regardless of whether available work required that he report for work later in the day. One who so restricts his willingness to accept employment has failed to establish that he is \"available for work\" within the meaning of this section.Moya v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1969-NMSC-022, 80 N.M. 39, 450 P.2d 925.\n\nAvailability.— Where the employee quit a job as a grocery clerk to accompany the employee's spouse, who had been laid off from the spouse's job, to a small rural community where they owned property; the rural community had only one grocery store which hired one clerk; there was another grocery store in a rural community twelve miles distant; and the employee applied regularly at both grocery stores, the employee had not removed the employee from the labor market and was not disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation benefits.Parsons v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-007, 71 N.M. 405, 379 P.2d 57.\n\nVI. LABOR DISPUTES\n\nDisqualification if labor dispute causes unemployment.— The question of whether an employee qualifies for unemployment benefits or falls within the disqualifying labor dispute provision of Subsection D (now C) requires not only a determination that a labor dispute existed but also a determination that the employee's unemployment resulted from the labor dispute.Wellborn Paint Mfg. Co. v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1984-NMCA-075, 101 N.M. 534, 685 P.2d 389.\n\nLockouts are potentially disqualifying labor disputes under Subsection D (now C),and once it is determined that a lockout occurred, the statute requires determination that the unemployment arose because of the labor dispute: this requires a causal connection between the employer's decision and a controversy relating to terms or conditions of employment.Wellborn Paint Mfg. Co. v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1984-NMCA-075, 101 N.M. 534, 685 P.2d 389.\n\nApplying availability standard to persons involved in labor dispute.— Applying an absolute standard of availability for permanent new work with no limitations or restrictions of any kind, regardless of the circumstances prevailing in particular cases to persons whose unemployment results from a labor dispute and holding them unavailable because they will not immediately return to their jobs with the employer with whom they are disputing, or will not sever their employment relationship with that employer and seek permanent new work, would in all cases make such persons ineligible and render the labor dispute disqualification provisions of this section totally superfluous.Albuquerque-Phoenix Express, Inc. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 88 N.M. 596, 544 P.2d 1161 (1975).\n\nPermanently replaced workers subject to disqualification.— An employer's notice to striking employees of an intent to permanently replace them during a labor dispute is not tantamount to termination of the strikers' employment, and if the striking employees make no attempt to gain reemployment during the dispute, the disqualifying provisions of Subsection D (now C) remain in effect.Salazar v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Div., 1993-NMSC-002, 115 N.M. 54, 846 P.2d 1063.\n\nClaimant has no duty to cross picket line to ascertain whether work is availableto him, nor does a failure to so cross under such circumstances disqualify a claimant for unemployment benefits. This would seem to be particularly true when it was known that operations had been completely shut down and all equipment secured and, under circumstances where the company, during prior labor disputes, had clearly advised the nonstriking employees of the particular work that was available to them.Wilson v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-085, 74 N.M. 3, 389 P.2d 855.\n\nFear of violence sufficient for not crossing picket line.— While one who voluntarily refuses to cross a picket line to go to his work which is available to him participates in the labor dispute, it is equally well recognized that one who has reason to fear violence or bodily harm is not required to pass a picket line, nor is it necessary that a claimant, to be eligible for unemployment benefits, actually experience violence or bodily harm in an attempt to cross a picket line. A reasonable fear of harm or violence is sufficient. Additionally, such fear may arise from the potential for violence, as well as from the violence itself.Wilson v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-085, 74 N.M. 3, 389 P.2d 855.\n\nFear must be reasonable.— Where employment security commission (now employment security division) found that claimants expressed fear of violence or bodily harm if they crossed picket line, but ignored the all-important requirement that such fears be reasonable, such a finding is incomplete for the purposes of supporting a legal conclusion and thus was properly ignored by the district court in making its own findings and conclusions.Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1970-NMSC-075, 81 N.M. 532, 469 P.2d 511.\n\nSection casts burden upon claimant to escape disqualificationby showing the eligibility under Subsections D(1) and D(2) (now C(1) and C(2)).Wilson v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-085, 74 N.M. 3, 389 P.2d 855.\n\nClaimants had burden of showing they did not participate in labor disputewhich caused the work stoppage. Where work was available to claimants, their failure to establish that they did not voluntarily refuse to cross the picket line because of a reasonable fear of harm or violence disqualified them from receiving unemployment compensation benefits.Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1970-NMSC-075, 81 N.M. 532, 469 P.2d 511.\n\nTerm \"stoppage of work,\"as it is used in the context of the Unemployment Compensation Act, refers to the employer's business rather than the employee's work and means a cessation or substantial curtailment of the employer's business.Albuquerque-Phoenix Express, Inc. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1975-NMSC-069, 88 N.M. 596, 544 P.2d 1161.\n\nProper definition of term \"directly interested in the labor dispute\"must turn upon the question of what caused the work stoppage in any particular case.Wilson v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-085, 74 N.M. 3, 389 P.2d 855.\n\nIn labor dispute procedural steps reduced to minimum.— Legislature intended that in a labor dispute the procedural steps should be reduced to a minimum in order to obtain a prompt ultimate decision.Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1967-NMSC-182, 78 N.M. 398, 432 P.2d 109.\n\nWhere claimants not directly interested in grievance.— Where the strike was called by reason of a grievance dispute over the suspension of a union member, in which claimants were not \"directly interested,\" there was an insufficient basis for disqualifying the claimants under this section.Wilson v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-085, 74 N.M. 3, 389 P.2d 855.\n\nWhere claimants' unemployment was due to a labor dispute between union and employer resulting from a grievance over the suspension of a union member, such labor dispute was not one in which claimants, whose wages, hours or working conditions could have been affected by the outcome, but who did not participate in the strike, were \"directly interested.\"Wilson v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 74 N.M. 3, 1963-NMSC-085, 389 P.2d 855.\n\nLabor dispute disqualification not applicable where business does not suffer substantial curtailment.— There was substantial evidence to support the district court's findings that the employer's business did not suffer any substantial curtailment when the employees involved walked off their jobs, and therefore the labor dispute disqualification provisions did not apply.Albuquerque-Phoenix Express, Inc. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1975-NMSC-069, 88 N.M. 596, 544 P.2d 1161.\n\nNot sensible for division to demand claimants quit jobs during labor dispute.— Since the claimants who were unemployed as a result of a labor dispute were already employed by the company, expected only a temporary unemployment period and, therefore, could be available only for temporary intervening work, it would not make much sense for the commission (now division) to demand that they, in fact, quit their jobs and really join the ranks of the unemployed, or that they abandon their legal rights and economic interest in the labor dispute and return to their jobs with the employer with whom they were disputing on the premise that their dispute was without merit.Albuquerque-Phoenix Express, Inc. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1975-NMSC-069, 88 N.M. 596, 544 P.2d 1161.\n\nVII. SUITABLE WORK\n\nClaimant's contention does not make evening work unsuitable.— Claimant's contention that his responsibility to his grandmother required that he remain with her in the evenings does not make such evening work unsuitable within the meaning of the statute.Moya v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1969-NMSC-022, 80 N.M. 39, 450 P.2d 925.\n\n\"Grade or class\" means organized group,or at least a cohesive group, acting in concert, where the striking member acts with the sanction of his associates, in their behalf.Wilson v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-085, 74 N.M. 3, 389 P.2d 855.\n\n\"Integral functioning\" was rejected as one of basic tests of grade or classunder the Unemployment Compensation Act.Wilson v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-085, 74 N.M. 3, 389 P.2d 855.\n\nDual payments not prohibited.— There is no inconsistency between this section and Section 51-1-50 NMSA 1978, and nothing under New Mexico law prohibits dual payment of unemployment compensation, so long as such payments are not duplicative in nature. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5635.\n\nPerson not to receive compensation under two laws.— Reading this section alone, its clear and obvious meaning would be that an individual could not, under any circumstances, receive unemployment compensation under the New Mexico law and under another such compensation law at the same time. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5635.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 76 Am.

      "heading": "Claims for benefits.",
      "text": "A. Claims for benefits shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the secretary may prescribe. Each employer shall post and maintain printed notices, in places readily accessible to employees, concerning their rights to file claims for unemployment benefits upon termination of their employment. Such notices shall be supplied by the division to each employer without cost to the employer.\n\nB. A representative designated by the secretary as a claims examiner shall promptly examine the application and each weekly claim and, on the basis of the facts found, shall determine whether the claimant is unemployed, the week with respect to which benefits shall commence, the weekly benefit amount payable, the maximum duration of benefits, whether the claimant is eligible for benefits pursuant to Section 51-1-5 NMSA 1978 and whether the claimant shall be disqualified pursuant to Section 51-1-7 NMSA 1978. With the approval of the secretary, the claims examiner may refer, without determination, claims or any specified issues involved therein that raise complex questions of fact or law to a hearing officer for the division for a fair hearing and decision in accordance with the procedure described in Subsection D of this section. The claims examiner shall promptly notify the claimant and any other interested party of the determination and the reasons therefor. Unless the claimant or interested party, within fifteen calendar days after the date of notification or mailing of the determination, files an appeal from the determination, the determination shall be the final decision of the division; provided that the claims examiner may reconsider a nonmonetary determination if additional information not previously available is provided or obtained or whenever the claims examiner finds an error in the application of law has occurred, but no redetermination shall be made more than twenty days from the date of the initial nonmonetary determination. Notice of a nonmonetary redetermination shall be given to all interested parties and shall be subject to appeal in the same manner as the original nonmonetary determination. If an appeal is pending at the time a redetermination is issued, the appeal, unless withdrawn, shall be treated as an appeal from the redetermination.\n\nC. In the case of a claim for waiting period credit or benefits, \"interested party\", for purposes of determinations and adjudication proceedings and notices thereof, means:\n\n(1) in the event of an issue concerning a separation from work for reasons other than lack of work, the claimant's most recent employer or most recent employing unit;\n\n(2) in the event of an issue concerning a separation from work for lack of work, the employer or employing unit from whom the claimant separated for reasons other than lack of work if the claimant has not worked and earned wages in insured work or bona fide employment other than self-employment in an amount equal to or exceeding five times the claimant's weekly benefit amount; or\n\n(3) in all other cases involving the allowance or disallowance of a claim, the secretary, the claimant and any employing unit directly involved in the facts at issue.\n\nD. Upon appeal by any party, a hearing officer designated by the secretary shall afford the parties reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing to be held de novo, and the hearing officer shall issue findings of fact and a decision that affirms, reverses or modifies the determination of the claims examiner or tax representative on the facts or the law, based upon the evidence introduced at such hearing, including the documents and statements in the claim or tax records of the division. All hearings shall be held in accordance with regulations of the secretary and decisions issued promptly in accordance with time lapse standards promulgated by the secretary of the United States department of labor. The parties shall be duly notified of the decision, together with the reasons therefor, which shall be deemed to be the final decision of the department, unless within fifteen days after the date of notification or mailing of the decision further appeal is initiated pursuant to Subsection H of this section.\n\nE. Except with the consent of the parties, no hearing officer or members of the board of review, established in Subsection F of this section, or secretary shall sit in any administrative or adjudicatory proceeding in which:\n\n(1) either of the parties is related to the hearing officer, member of the board of review or secretary by affinity or consanguinity within the degree of first cousin;\n\n(2) the hearing officer, member of the board of review or secretary was counsel for either party in that action; or\n\n(3) the hearing officer, member of the board of review or secretary has an interest that would prejudice the rendering of an impartial decision.\n\nThe secretary, any member of the board of review or appeal tribunal hearing officer shall withdraw from any proceeding in which the hearing officer, member of the board of review or secretary cannot accord a fair and impartial hearing or when a reasonable person would seriously doubt whether the hearing officer, board member or secretary could be fair and impartial. Any party may request a disqualification of any appeal tribunal hearing officer or board of review member by filing an affidavit with the board of review or appeal tribunal promptly upon discovery of the alleged grounds for disqualification, stating with particularity the grounds upon which it is claimed that the person cannot be fair and impartial. The disqualification shall be mandatory if sufficient factual basis is set forth in the affidavit of disqualification. If a member of the board of review is disqualified or withdraws from any proceeding, the remaining members of the board of review may appoint an appeal tribunal hearing officer to sit on the board of review for the proceeding involved.\n\nF. There is established within the department, for the purpose of providing higher level administrative appeal and review of determinations of a claims examiner or decisions issued by a hearing officer pursuant to Subsection B or D of this section, a \"board of review\" consisting of three members. Two members shall be appointed by the governor with the consent of the senate. The members so appointed shall hold office at the pleasure of the governor for terms of four years. One member appointed by the governor shall be a person who, on account of previous vocation, employment or affiliation, can be classed as a representative of employers, and the other member appointed by the governor shall be a person who, on account of previous vocation, employment or affiliation, can be classed as a representative of employees. The third member shall be an employee of the department appointed by the secretary who shall serve as chair of the board. Either member of the board of review appointed by the governor who has missed two consecutive meetings of the board may be removed from the board by the governor. Actions of the board shall be taken by majority vote. If a vacancy on the board in a position appointed by the governor occurs between sessions of the legislature, the position shall be filled by the governor until the next regular legislative session. The board shall meet at the call of the secretary. Members of the board appointed by the governor shall be paid per diem and mileage in accordance with the Per Diem and Mileage Act [10-8-1 to 10-8-8 NMSA 1978] for necessary travel to attend regularly scheduled meetings of the board of review for the purpose of conducting the board's appellate and review duties.\n\nG. The board of review shall hear and review all cases appealed in accordance with Subsection H of this section. The board of review may affirm, reverse or modify the decision of the hearing officer or remand any matter to the claims examiner, tax representative or hearing officer for further proceedings. Each member appointed by the governor shall be compensated at the rate of fifteen dollars ($15.00) for each case reviewed up to a maximum compensation of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) in any one fiscal year.\n\nH. Any party aggrieved by a final decision of a hearing officer may file, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the secretary, an application for appeal and review of the decision with the secretary. The secretary shall review the application and shall, within fifteen days after receipt of the application, either affirm the decision of the hearing officer, reverse the decision of the hearing officer, modify the decision of the hearing officer, remand the matter to the hearing officer, tax representative or claims examiner for an additional hearing or refer the decision to the board of review for further review and decision on the merits of the appeal. If the secretary affirms, reverses or modifies the decision of the hearing officer, that decision shall be the final administrative decision of the department and any appeal therefrom shall be taken to the district court in accordance with the provisions of Subsections M and N of this section. If the secretary remands a matter to a hearing officer, tax representative or claims examiner for an additional hearing, judicial review shall be permitted only after issuance of a final administrative decision. If the secretary refers the decision of the hearing officer to the board of review for further review, the board's decision on the merits of the appeal shall be the final administrative decision of the department, which may be appealed to the district court in accordance with the provisions of Subsections M and N of this section. If the secretary takes no action within fifteen days of receipt of the application for appeal and review, the decision shall be promptly scheduled for review by the board of review as though it had been referred by the secretary. The secretary may request the board of review to review a decision of a hearing officer that the secretary believes to be inconsistent with the law or with applicable rules of interpretation or that is not supported by the evidence, and the board of review shall grant the request if it is filed within fifteen days of the issuance of the decision of the hearing officer. The secretary may also direct that any pending determination or adjudicatory proceeding be removed to the board of review for a final decision. If the board of review holds a hearing on any matter, the hearing shall be conducted by a quorum of the board of review in accordance with regulations prescribed by the secretary for hearing appeals. The board of review shall promptly notify the interested parties of its findings of fact and decision. A decision of the board of review on any disputed matter reviewed and decided by it shall be based upon the law and the lawful rules of interpretation issued by the secretary, and it shall be the final administrative decision of the department, except in cases of remand. If the board of review remands a matter to a hearing officer, claims examiner or tax representative, judicial review shall be permitted only after issuance of a final administrative decision.\n\nI. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section granting any party the right to appeal, benefits shall be paid promptly in accordance with a determination or a decision of a claims examiner, hearing officer, secretary, board of review or reviewing court, regardless of the pendency of the period to file an appeal or petition for judicial review that is provided with respect thereto in Subsection D or M of this section or the pendency of any such filing or petition until such determination or decision has been modified or reversed by a subsequent decision. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all claims for benefits pending on the date of its enactment.\n\nJ. If a determination or decision allowing benefits is finally modified or reversed, the appropriate contributing employer will be relieved of benefit charges in accordance with Subsection A of Section 51-1-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nK. The manner in which disputed claims shall be presented, the reports thereon required from the claimant and from employers and the conduct of hearings and appeals shall be in accordance with rules prescribed by the secretary for determining the rights of the parties, whether or not the rules conform to common law or statutory rules of evidence and other technical rules of procedure. A hearing officer or the board of review may refer to the secretary for interpretation any question of controlling legal significance, and the secretary shall issue a declaratory interpretation, which shall be binding upon the decision of the hearing officer and the board of review. A full and complete record shall be kept of all proceedings in connection with a disputed claim. All testimony at any hearing upon a disputed claim shall be recorded but need not be transcribed unless the disputed claim is appealed to the district court.\n\nL. Witnesses subpoenaed pursuant to this section shall be allowed fees at a rate fixed by the secretary. Such fees and all administrative expenses of proceedings involving disputed claims shall be deemed a part of the expense of administering the Unemployment Compensation Law.\n\nM. Any determination or decision of a claims examiner or hearing officer or by a representative of the tax section of the department in the absence of an appeal therefrom as provided by this section shall become final fifteen days after the date of notification or mailing thereof, and judicial review thereof shall be permitted only after any party claiming to be aggrieved thereby has exhausted the remedies as provided in Subsection H of this section. The division and any employer or claimant who is affected by the decision shall be joined as a party in any judicial action involving the decision. All parties shall be served with an endorsed copy of the petition within thirty days from the date of filing and an endorsed copy of the order granting the petition within fifteen days from entry of the order. Service on the department shall be made on the secretary or the secretary's designated legal representative either by mail with accompanying certification of service or by personal service. The division may be represented in a judicial action by an attorney employed by the department or, when requested by the secretary, by the attorney general or any district attorney.\n\nN. The final decision of the secretary or board of review upon any disputed matter may be reviewed both upon the law, including the lawful rules of interpretation issued by the secretary, and the facts by the district court of the county wherein the person seeking the review resides upon certiorari, unless it is determined by the district court where the petition is filed that, as a matter of equity and due process, venue should be in a different county. For the purpose of the review, the division shall return on certiorari the reports and all of the evidence heard by it on the reports and all the papers and documents in its files affecting the matters and things involved in such certiorari. The district court shall render its judgment after hearing, and either the department or any other party affected may appeal from the judgment to the court of appeals in accordance with the rules of appellate procedure. Certiorari shall not be granted unless applied for within thirty days from the date of the final decision of the secretary or board of review. Certiorari shall be heard in a summary manner and shall be given precedence over all other civil cases except cases arising under the Workers' Compensation Act [Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978]. It is not necessary in any proceedings before the division to enter exceptions to the rulings, and no bond shall be required in obtaining certiorari from the district court, but certiorari shall be granted as a matter of right to the party applying therefor.\n\nHistory:Laws 1936 (S.S.), ch. 1, § 6; 1941 Comp., § 57-806; 1953 Comp., § 59-9-6; Laws 1953, ch. 121, § 4; 1972, ch. 5, § 1; 1973, ch. 216, § 1; 1979, ch. 280, § 15; 1981, ch. 354, § 4; 1983, ch. 199, § 4; 1987, ch. 63, § 2; 1990, ch. 18, § 3; 1991, ch. 122, § 5; 1993, ch. 209, § 3; 1994, ch. 89, § 1; 1996, ch. 33, § 1; 1998, ch. 91, § 2; 2004, ch. 93, § 1; 2013, ch. 132, § 1; 2013, ch. 133, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For procedures governing appeals to the district court,seeRule 1-077 NMRA.\n\nFor Rules of Evidence,seeRule 11-101 NMRA et seq.\n\nFor scope of review of the district court,seeZamora v.

added present Subsection C; designated the former fifth through seventh sentences of Subsection B as present Subsection D; designated former Subsections D to M as present Subsections E to N; inserted \"remanded the matter to the hearing officer for an additional hearing\" in the second sentence of present Subsection H; substituted \"shall be paid\" for \"must be paid\" near the beginning of the first sentence in present Subsection I; substituted \"Workers' Compensation Act\" for \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" in the fifth sentence in present Subsection N; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nReview by the court of appeals.— A party does not have an appeal as of right from the decision of the district court on review of administrative decisions involving unemployment compensation benefits. Rule 12-505 NMRA requires a party to seek discretionary review of the district court decision in the court of appeals by means of a petition for writ of certiorari.Wakeland v. New Mexico Dep't of Workforce Solutions, 2012-NMCA-021, 274 P.3d 766, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-001.\n\nCourt without jurisdiction where appeal taken to division.— District court was without jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a commission (now division) decision, where appellant merely took his appeal to the commission (division) itself, rather than the district court, within 15 days after notification of the decision.Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1967-NMSC-182, 78 N.M. 398, 432 P.2d 109 (1967).\n\nDivision quasi-judicial in nature.— The express power granted the commission (now division) by the legislature is quasi-judicial in its nature and authorizes it to decide issues submitted under the labor dispute of Section 51-1-7D NMSA 1978 (now Section 51-1-7C NMSA 1978).Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1967-NMSC-182, 78 N.M. 398, 432 P.2d 109.\n\nApplicability of procedural provisions.— Legislature intended that procedural provisions of the Unemployment Compensation Law should apply to decisions fixing employer's rate of contribution to the same extent as they do to employee's claim for benefits under the act.M.R. Prestridge Lumber Co. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1946-NMSC-026, 50 N.M. 309, 176 P.2d 190.\n\nFailure to follow statute and regulations.— Where worker was terminated by employer for fighting; worker filed a claim for unemployment benefits on May 16, 2010; employer did not respond to the department's request for separation information and the department did not conduct an investigation; although the department did not issue a notice of claim determination concerning the separation issue, it informed worker that worker was eligible for benefits and provided benefits commencing May 29, 2010 for thirteen weeks; when worker filed a second claim on June 28, 2011 for unemployment benefits for the next benefit year, the department telephoned worker and employer, and learned that worker had been fired for fighting with another employee; the department disqualified worker from receiving benefits beginning the week ending May 22, 2010 and sent worker an overpayment notice informing worker that worker was liable for repayment for fifty-eight weeks of benefits; and the department's regulations permitted the department to reconsider a claim due to new or additional information within twenty days after the date of the original determination or date of first payment, whichever occurred last, the department was precluded from reconsidering worker's claim because the reason for worker's termination could have been discovered during the initial processing of worker's claim and the department reconsidered worker's claim more than thirteen months after either the original determination of worker's eligibility or the first payment of benefits to worker.Narvaez v. New Mexico Dep't of Workforce Solutions, 2013-NMCA-079, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-006.\n\nProcedural steps reduced to minimum in labor dispute.— Legislature intended that in a labor dispute the procedural steps should be reduced to a minimum in order to obtain a prompt ultimate decision.Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1967-NMSC-182, 78 N.M. 398, 432 P.2d 109.\n\nService requirements not jurisdictional.— Strict compliance with the service requirement of Subsection M was not a precondition to jurisdiction of an appeal from a final administrative decision; thus, the district court had jurisdiction when the employee filed his petition for certiorari with the court within 30 days as required by Subsection N, even though service of the petition and the order on the Department of Labor, Employment Security Division and the employer was 16 days late.Jueng v. New Mexico Dep't of Labor, 1996-NMSC-006, 121 N.M. 237, 910 P.2d 313.\n\nCourt to make own findings of fact.— In determining the scope of review of the district court, this section and Rule 1-081C(4) NMRA mean that the district court shall make its own findings of fact after a review of the evidence. They do not mean, necessarily, that the district court must ignore the findings of the department (now division). It may give them some weight and should follow the department's (division's) findings in making its own, save where the evidence clearly preponderates against him. In the last analysis, however, the responsibility of making correct findings rests with the district court and it is not to be hampered or embarrassed in the performance of this duty by the findings of the department (division).Ribera v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-029, 92 N.M. 694, 594 P.2d 742 (decided under prior law).\n\nAlthough additional evidence not contemplated.— Although Subsection M (now N) provides that \"the district court shall render its judgment after hearing,\" the taking of additional evidence by the district court is not contemplated by this section.Abernathy v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-047, 93 N.M. 71, 596 P.2d 514.\n\nCourt examines entire record.— To decide if the district court was correct in finding substantial evidence to support the order of the board, the reviewing court must independently examine the entire record.Randolph v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Dep't, 1989-NMSC-031, 108 N.M. 441, 774 P.2d 435.\n\nCourt to give weight to division findings.— District court in reviewing action of employment security commission (now employment security division) in fixing an employer's rate of contribution must give weight to findings made at hearing before the commission (division) and should follow such findings, except where the evidence clearly preponderates against such findings.M.R. Prestridge Lumber Co. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1946-NMSC-026, 50 N.M. 309, 176 P.2d 190.\n\nIn reviewing an award of unemployment benefits, the district court must grant the board of review its proper authority to exclude evidence and substitute its own findings of fact for those of the hearing officer, where appropriate.Mississippi Potash, Inc. v. Lemon, 2003-NMCA-014, 133 N.M. 128, 61 P.3d 837.\n\nDivision's findings to be supported by substantial evidence.— This section and Rule 1-081C(4) NMRA, require the district court to review a challenged decision of the employment security commission (now employment security division) to determine whether it is lawful. In so determining, the reviewing court must determine whether the commission's (now division's) findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. The trial court shall adopt as its own such of the commission's (division's) findings of fact as it determines to be supported by substantial evidence and shall make such conclusions of law and decision as lawfully follow therefrom. If the district court determines that the legal evidence before the commission (division) fails to substantially support such findings or decision, then the district court shall make its own findings of fact, conclusions of law and decision based only upon the legal evidence before the commission (division).Wilson v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-085, 74 N.M. 3, 389 P.2d 855;Abernathy v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-047, 93 N.M. 71, 596 P.2d 514;Ribera v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-029, 92 N.M. 694, 594 P.2d 742 (decided under prior law).\n\n\"Substantial evidence\" defined.— \"Substantial evidence\" means more than merely any evidence, more than a scintilla of evidence, and contemplates such relevant legal evidence as a reasonable person might accept as sufficient to support a conclusion; evidence is substantial if reasonable men all agree, or if they may fairly differ, as to whether it establishes a fact.Ribera v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-029, 92 N.M. 694,594 P.2d 742.\n\nNo right of reconsideration after board of review decision.— After the commission (now board of review) has rendered its decision it has exercised the express power conferred by the act upon it. No right of reconsideration remains.Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1967-NMSC-182, 78 N.M. 398, 432 P.2d 109.\n\nNo private right of action for interference with recovery of unemployment compensation.— A terminated employee who alleged that her employer's testimony prevented her from receiving unemployment benefits had no private right of action against the employer for interference with recovery of unemployment compensation.Stock v. Grantham, 1998-NMCA-081, 125 N.M. 564, 964 P.2d 125, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 322, 961 P.2d 167.\n\nLast employer deemed party to district court proceedings.— The last employer of a claimant by virtue of its participation in the adjudicatory hearing before the employment security commission (now employment security division) is a party to proceedings in the district court and that court may properly deny a commission (division) motion to dismiss because of failure to join the last employer.Abernathy v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-047, 93 N.M. 71, 596 P.2d 514.\n\nStatement of counsel of poor quality transcript does not support conclusion.— Statement by counsel in employment security commission (now employment security division) proceedings that transcript of hearing before the deputy was not of the quality to be placed in the record due to mechanical difficulties does not justify a conclusion that the record was incomplete or illegible or insufficient for appeal.Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 1967-NMSC-182, 78 N.M. 398, 432 P.2d 109.\n\nDivision not to withhold payment where eligibility determined to preliminary hearing.— The employment security commission (now employment security division) may not withhold payment, pending the employer's appeal, of unemployment compensation benefits to those employees who have been found eligible for such benefits at the preliminary determination hearing. 1972 Op.

If the successor employer fails to notify the division of the acquisition within this time limit, the division, when it receives actual notice, shall effect the transfer of the experience history and applicable rate of contribution retroactively to the date of the acquisition, and the successor shall pay a penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00); and\n\n(d) where the transaction involves only a merger, consolidation or other form of reorganization without a substantial change in the ownership and controlling interest of the business entity, as determined by the secretary, the limitations on transfers stated in Subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this paragraph shall not apply. A party to a merger, consolidation or other form of reorganization described in this subparagraph shall not be relieved of liability for any contributions, interest or penalties due and owing from the employing enterprise at the time of the merger, consolidation or other form of reorganization;\n\n(2) the applicable experience history may be transferred to the successor in the case of a partial transfer of an employing enterprise if the successor has acquired one or more of the several employing enterprises of a predecessor but not all of the employing enterprises of the predecessor and each employing enterprise so acquired was operated by the predecessor as a separate store, factory, shop or other separate employing enterprise and the predecessor, throughout the entire period of the contribution with liability applicable to each enterprise transferred, has maintained and preserved payroll records that, together with records of contribution liability and benefit chargeability, can be separated by the parties from the enterprises retained by the predecessor to the satisfaction of the secretary or the secretary's delegate. A partial experience history transfer will be made only if the successor:\n\n(a) notifies the division of the acquisition, in writing, not later than the due date of the successor's first quarterly wage and contribution report after the effective date of the acquisition;\n\n(b) files an application provided by the division that contains the endorsement of the predecessor within thirty days from the delivery or mailing of such application by the division to the successor's last known address; and\n\n(c) files with the application a form with a schedule of the name and social security number of and the wages paid to and the contributions paid for each employee for the three and one-half-year period preceding the computation date through the date of transfer or such lesser period as the enterprises transferred may have been in operation. The application and form shall be supported by the predecessor's permanent employment records, which shall be available for audit by the division. The application and form shall be reviewed by the division and, upon approval, the percentage of the predecessor's experience history attributable to the enterprises transferred shall be transferred to the successor. The percentage shall be obtained by dividing the taxable payrolls of the transferred enterprises for such three and one-half-year period preceding the date of computation or such lesser period as the enterprises transferred may have been in operation by the predecessor's entire payroll;\n\n(3) if, at the time of a transfer of an employing enterprise in whole or in part, both the predecessor and the successor are under common ownership, then the experience history attributable to the transferred business shall also be transferred to and combined with the experience history attributable to the successor employer. The rates of both employers shall be recalculated and made effective immediately upon the date of the transfer;\n\n(4) whenever a person, who is not currently an employer, acquires the trade or business of an employing enterprise, the experience history of the acquired business shall not be transferred to the successor if the secretary or the secretary's designee finds that the successor acquired the business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions. Instead, the successor shall be assigned the applicable new employer rate pursuant to this section. In determining whether the business was acquired solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contribution, the secretary or the secretary's designee shall consider:\n\n(a) the cost of acquiring the business;\n\n(b) whether the person continued the business enterprise of the acquired business;\n\n(c) how long such business enterprise was continued; and\n\n(d) whether a substantial number of new employees was hired for performance of duties unrelated to those that the business activity conducted prior to acquisition;\n\n(5) if, following a transfer of experience history pursuant to this subsection, the department determines that a substantial purpose of the transfer of the employing enterprise was to obtain a reduced liability for contributions, then the experience rating accounts of the employers involved shall be combined into a single account and a single rate assigned to the combined account;\n\n(6) the secretary shall adopt such rules as are necessary to interpret and carry out the provisions of this subsection, including rules that:\n\n(a) describe how experience history is to be transferred; and\n\n(b) establish procedures to identify the type of transfer or acquisition of an employing enterprise; and\n\n(7) a person who knowingly violates or attempts to violate a rule adopted pursuant to Paragraph (6) of this subsection, who transfers or acquires, or attempts to transfer or acquire, an employing enterprise for the sole or primary purpose of obtaining a reduced liability for contributions or who knowingly advises another person to violate a rule adopted pursuant to Paragraph (6) of this subsection or to transfer or acquire an employing enterprise for the sole or primary purpose of obtaining a reduced liability for contributions is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not less than one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) or more than three thousand dollars ($3,000) or, if an individual, by imprisonment for a definite term not to exceed ninety days or both. In addition, such a person shall be subject to the following civil penalty imposed by the secretary:\n\n(a) if the person is an employer, the person shall be assigned the highest contribution rate established by the provisions of this section for the calendar year in which the violation occurs and the three subsequent calendar years; provided that, if the difference between the increased penalty rate and the rate otherwise applicable would be less than two percent of the employer's payroll, the contribution rate shall be increased by two percent of the employer's payroll for the calendar year in which the violation occurs and the three subsequent calendar years; or\n\n(b) if the person is not an employer, the secretary may impose a civil penalty not to exceed three thousand dollars ($3,000).\n\nF. Except as provided in Subsection Q of this section, for each calendar year, if, as of the computation date for that year, an employer has been a contributing employer throughout the preceding twenty-four months, the contribution rate for that employer shall be determined by multiplying the employer's benefit ratio by the reserve factor as determined pursuant to Subsection H of this section and, for each calendar year beginning in calendar year 2017, then multiplying that product by the employer's experience history factor as determined under Subsection I of this section; provided that an employer's contribution rate shall not be less than thirty-three hundredths percent or more than five and four-tenths percent. An employer's benefit ratio is determined by dividing the employer's benefit charges during the immediately preceding fiscal years, up to a maximum of three fiscal years, by the total of the annual payrolls of the same time period, calculated to four decimal places, disregarding any remaining fraction.\n\nG. Except as provided in Subsection Q of this section, for each calendar year, if, as of the computation date of that year, an employer has been a contributing employer for less than twenty-four months, the contribution rate for that employer shall be the average of the contribution rates for all contributing employers in the employer's industry, as determined by administrative rule, but shall not be less than one percent or more than five and four-tenths percent; provided that an individual, type of organization or employing unit that acquires all or part of the trade or business of another employing unit, pursuant to Paragraphs (2) and (3) of Subsection E of Section 51-1-42 NMSA 1978, that has a rate of contribution less than average of the contribution rates for all contributing employers in the employer's industry, shall be entitled to the transfer of the contribution rate of the other employing unit to the extent permitted under Subsection E of this section.\n\nH. The division shall ensure that the fund sustains an adequate reserve. An adequate reserve shall be determined to mean that the funds in the fund available for benefits equal the total amount of funds needed to pay between eighteen and twenty-four months of benefits at the average of the five highest years of benefits paid in the last twenty-five years. Except as provided in Subsection Q of this section, for the purpose of sustaining an adequate reserve, the division shall determine a reserve factor to be used when calculating an employer's contribution rate pursuant to Subsection F of this section by rule promulgated by the secretary. Except as provided in Subsection Q of this section, the rules shall set forth a formula that will set the reserve factor in proportion to the difference between the amount of funds available for benefits in the fund, as of the computation date, and the adequate reserve, within the following guidelines:\n\n(1) 1.0000 if, as of the computation date, there is an adequate reserve;\n\n(2) between 0.5000 and 0.9999 if, as of the computation date, there is greater than an adequate reserve; and\n\n(3) between 1.0001 and 4.0000 if, as of the computation date, there is less than an adequate reserve.\n\nI. Except as provided in Subsection Q of this section, for each calendar year beginning in calendar year 2017, if, as of the computation date for that calendar year, an employer has been a contributing employer throughout the preceding twenty-four months, the employer's experience history factor shall be determined as of the computation date and shall be based on the employer's reserve. The employer's reserve shall be calculated as the difference between all of the employer's previous years' contribution payments and all of the employer's previous years' benefit charges, divided by the average of the employer's annual payrolls for the immediately preceding fiscal years, up to a maximum of three fiscal years.\n\nIf an employer's reserve is:\n\nThe employer's experiencehistory factor is:\n\n6.0% and over\n\nJ. Except as provided in Subsection Q of this section, if an employer's contribution rate pursuant to Subsection F of this section is calculated to be greater than five and four-tenths percent, notwithstanding the limitation pursuant to Subsection F of this section, the employer shall be charged an excess claims premium in addition to the contribution rate applicable to the employer; provided that an employer's excess claims premium shall not exceed one percent of the employer's annual payroll. The excess claims premium shall be determined by multiplying the employer's excess claims rate by the employer's annual payroll. An employer's excess claims rate shall be determined by multiplying the difference of the employer's contribution rate, notwithstanding the limitation pursuant to Subsection F of this section, less five and four-tenths percent by ten percent.\n\nK. Effective calendar year 2017, any other provision of law notwithstanding, an employer's contribution rate plus the employer's excess claims rate, if any, shall increase by no more than two percentage points from one calendar year to the next.\n\nL. Except as provided in Subsection Q of this section, the division shall promptly notify each employer of the employer's rate of contributions and excess claims premium as determined for any calendar year pursuant to this section. Such notification shall include the amount determined as the employer's annual payroll, the total of all of the employer's contributions paid on the employer's behalf for all past years and total benefits charged to the employer for all such years. Such determination shall become conclusive and binding upon the employer unless, within thirty days after the mailing of notice thereof to the employer's last known address or in the absence of mailing, within thirty days after the delivery of such notice, the employer files an application for review and redetermination, setting forth the employer's reason therefor. The employer shall be granted an opportunity for a fair hearing in accordance with rules prescribed by the secretary, but an employer shall not have standing, in any proceeding involving the employer's rate of contributions or contribution liability, to contest the chargeability to the employer of any benefits paid in accordance with a determination, redetermination or decision pursuant to Section 51-1-8 NMSA 1978, except upon the ground that the services on the basis of which such benefits were found to be chargeable did not constitute services performed in employment for the employer and only in the event that the employer was not a party to such determination, redetermination or decision, or to any other proceedings under the Unemployment Compensation Law in which the character of such services was determined. The employer shall be promptly notified of the decision on the employer's application for redetermination, which shall become final unless, within fifteen days after the mailing of notice thereof to the employer's last known address or in the absence of mailing, within fifteen days after the delivery of such notice, further appeal is initiated pursuant to Subsection D of Section 51-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nM. The division shall provide each contributing employer, within ninety days of the end of each calendar quarter, a written determination of benefits chargeable to the employer. Such determination shall become conclusive and binding upon the employer for all purposes unless, within thirty days after the mailing of the determination to the employer's last known address or in the absence of mailing, within thirty days after the delivery of such determination, the employer files an application for review and redetermination, setting forth the employer's reason therefor. The employer shall be granted an opportunity for a fair hearing in accordance with rules prescribed by the secretary, but an employer shall not have standing in any proceeding involving the employer's contribution liability to contest the chargeability to the employer of any benefits paid in accordance with a determination, redetermination or decision pursuant to Section 51-1-8 NMSA 1978, except upon the ground that the services on the basis of which such benefits were found to be chargeable did not constitute services performed in employment for the employer and only in the event that the employer was not a party to such determination, redetermination or decision, or to any other proceedings under the Unemployment Compensation Law [Chapter 51 NMSA 1978] in which the character of such services was determined. The employer shall be promptly notified of the decision on the employer's application for redetermination, which shall become final unless, within fifteen days after the mailing of notice thereof to the employer's last known address or in the absence of mailing, within fifteen days after the delivery of such notice, further appeal is initiated pursuant to Subsection D of Section 51-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nN. The contributions and excess claims premiums, together with interest and penalties thereon imposed by the Unemployment Compensation Law, shall not be assessed nor shall action to collect the same be commenced more than four years after a report showing the amount of the contributions was due. In the case of a false or fraudulent contribution report with intent to evade contributions or a willful failure to file a report of all contributions due, the contributions and excess claims premiums, together with interest and penalties thereon, may be assessed or an action to collect such contributions may be begun at any time. Before the expiration of such period of limitation, the employer and the secretary may agree in writing to an extension thereof and the period so agreed on may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing. In any case where the assessment has been made and action to collect has been commenced within four years of the due date of any contribution, excess claims premium, interest or penalty, including the filing of a warrant of lien by the secretary pursuant to Section 51-1-36 NMSA 1978, such action shall not be subject to any period of limitation.\n\nO. The secretary shall correct any error in the determination of an employer's rate of contribution during the calendar year to which the erroneous rate applies, notwithstanding that notification of the employer's rate of contribution may have been issued and contributions paid pursuant to the notification. Upon issuance by the division of a corrected rate of contribution, the employer shall have the same rights to review and redetermination as provided in Subsection L of this section.\n\nP. Any interest required to be paid on advances to this state's unemployment compensation fund under Title 12 of the Social Security Act shall be paid in a timely manner as required under Section 1202 of Title 12 of the Social Security Act and shall not be paid, directly or indirectly, by the state from amounts in the state's unemployment compensation fund.\n\nQ. The secretary shall omit data for March 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021 from calculations of an employing enterprise's experience history, excess claims premiums and excess claims rates. The secretary shall use the 2019 computation date reserve factor from January 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021.\n\nR. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"annual payroll\" means the total taxable amount of remuneration from an employer for employment during a twelve-month period ending on a computation date;\n\n(2) \"base-period employers\" means the employers of an individual during the individual's base period;\n\n(3) \"base-period wages\" means the wages of an individual for insured work during the individual's base period on the basis of which the individual's benefit rights were determined;\n\n(4) \"common ownership\" means that two or more businesses are substantially owned, managed or controlled by the same person or persons;\n\n(5) \"computation date\" for each calendar year means the close of business on June 30 of the preceding calendar year;\n\n(6) \"employing enterprise\" means a business activity engaged in by a contributing employing unit in which one or more persons have been employed within the current or the three preceding calendar quarters.

the governor vetoed the provision that fixed the 2012 contribution schedule at Schedule 3; and the partial veto resulted in the elimination of a contribution schedule for 2012, which effectively exempted established employers from making mandatory contributions to the unemployment compensation fund for calendar year 2012, the partial veto was unconstitutional because what remained after the partial veto was an unworkable piece of legislation and the court ordered that the legislation be reinstated as passed by the legislature.State of N.M. ex rel.

Any nonprofit organization that, pursuant to Paragraph (8) of Subsection F of Section 51-1-42 NMSA 1978, is subject to the Unemployment Compensation Law shall pay contributions in accordance with the provisions of Section 51-1-9 NMSA 1978, unless it elects, in accordance with this subsection, to pay to the division for the fund an amount equal to the amount of regular benefits and of one-half of the extended benefits paid, that is attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization, to individuals for weeks of unemployment that begin during the effective period of such election.\n\n(1) Any nonprofit organization that becomes subject to the Unemployment Compensation Law after January 1, 1972 may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions for a period of not less than two taxable years by filing a written notice of its election with the division not later than thirty days immediately following the date subjectivity is determined.\n\n(2) Any nonprofit organization that makes an election in accordance with Paragraph (1) of this subsection will continue to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions until it files with the division a written notice terminating its election not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of the taxable year for which such termination shall first be effective.\n\n(3) Any nonprofit organization that has been paying contributions under the Unemployment Compensation Law may change to a reimbursable basis by filing with the division written notice of its election not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of the taxable year for which its election shall first be effective. Such election shall not be terminated by the organization for the following two taxable years.\n\n(4) The division, in accordance with such regulations as the secretary may prescribe, shall notify each nonprofit organization of any determination that it may make of the organization's status as an employer and of the effective date of any election that the organization makes and of any termination of such election. Such determination shall be subject to reconsideration, appeal and review in accordance with regulations of the secretary governing appeals by employers of their liability under Section 51-1-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. Payments in lieu of contributions shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(1) At the end of each calendar quarter or at the end of any other period as determined by the secretary, the division shall bill each nonprofit organization or group of such organizations that has elected to make payments in lieu of contributions for an amount equal to the full amount of regular benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid during such quarter or other prescribed period that is attributable to service in the employ of such organization.\n\n(2) Effective with the calendar quarter beginning January 1, 1987 and each succeeding calendar quarter, each employer that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions, including governmental entities, shall pay to the division an amount equal to twenty-five percent of the total benefit charges made to each such employer during the four calendar quarters ending the preceding June 30. Such payments shall be made on or before the tenth day of the first month of each calendar quarter.\n\n(3) In the event that any employer liable for making payments in lieu of contributions incurred no benefit charges during the four calendar quarters ending the preceding June 30, the employer shall pay to the division, each calendar quarter, an amount equal to one-eighth of one percent of the employer's annual taxable wages paid for such period for employment as defined in Subsection F of Section 51-1-42 NMSA 1978 and Section 51-1-44 NMSA 1978 as estimated by the secretary. Such payments shall be paid on or before the tenth day of the first month of the calendar quarter.\n\n(4) For each calendar quarter, the secretary shall determine the amount paid by each employer subject to payment in lieu of contributions and the amount of benefits charged to such employer. Each employer who has made payments in an amount less than the amount of benefits charged to the employer shall pay the balance of the amount charged within twenty-five days of the notification by the division. If the quarterly payment made by an employer pursuant to Paragraph (2) of this subsection exceeds the amount of benefits charged to such employer, the excess payment shall be refunded on a quarterly basis.\n\n(5) Payments made by any nonprofit organization under the provisions of this subsection shall not be deducted or deductible, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in the employ of the organization.\n\nC. Collection of past due payments of amounts in lieu of contributions shall be as provided in this subsection.\n\n(1) Past due payments of amounts in lieu of contributions are subject to the same penalties that are applied to past due contributions pursuant to Section 51-1-12 NMSA 1978.\n\n(2) The provisions of Section 51-1-36 NMSA 1978 shall apply to all contributions or payments of amounts in lieu of contributions for which a nonprofit organization becomes liable pursuant to an election made pursuant to Subsection A of this section.\n\n(3) Any nonprofit organization that elects to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be required, within thirty days after the effective date of its election, to execute and file with the secretary a surety bond or such other surety undertaking or security, which may consist of a cash security deposit, in a form approved by the secretary. With the consent of the secretary, a cash security deposit may be made in three annual installments. This paragraph shall not apply to:\n\n(a) group accounts established pursuant to Subsection E of this section or any member of such a group account; or\n\n(b) governmental entities as defined in Subsection B of Section 51-1-44 NMSA 1978; except that all instrumentalities of governmental entities shall be included as part of the controlling governmental entity or entities for purposes of determining liability for the payment of unemployment compensation contributions.\n\n(4) The amount of the surety bond or other surety undertaking or security required by Paragraph (3) of this subsection shall be equal to 2.7 percent of contribution times the organization's taxable wages paid for employment, as defined in Subsection F of Section 51-1-42 NMSA 1978 and Section 51-1-44 NMSA 1978, for the four calendar quarters immediately preceding the effective date of the election. If the nonprofit organization did not pay wages in each of the preceding four calendar quarters, the amount of surety bond required shall be determined by the secretary based upon an estimate of taxable wages to be paid during the succeeding four calendar quarters. Thereafter, the amount of the surety bond shall be adjusted on the basis of the organization's actual taxable payroll.\n\n(5) If any nonprofit organization that is not required to execute and file a surety bond or other security is delinquent in making payments in lieu of contributions as required pursuant to Subsection B of this section or if any nonprofit organization that is required to execute and maintain a surety bond or other security fails to do so or is delinquent in making payments as required pursuant to Subsection B of this section, the secretary may terminate the organization's election to make payments in lieu of contributions effective as of the beginning of the next taxable year and the termination shall be effective until the organization executes and files with the department a surety bond or other security as required.\n\n(6) Any bond or other surety undertaking or security required under this subsection shall be in force for a period of not less than two taxable years and shall be renewed with the approval of the secretary at such times as the secretary may prescribe.\n\nD. Each employer who is liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall pay to the division for the fund the amount of regular benefits plus the amount of one-half of extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of that employer in accordance with the provisions of Subsection A of Section 51-1-11 NMSA 1978, except that any employer that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall not be relieved of charges for benefits paid to an individual who was separated from the employ of that employer for any reason.\n\nE. Two or more employers who have become liable for payments in lieu of contributions, in accordance with the provisions of Subsection A of this section, Subsection B of Section 51-1-14 NMSA 1978 and Section 51-1-16 NMSA 1978, may file a joint application for the establishment of a group account for the purpose of sharing the cost of benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employers. Each application shall identify and authorize a group representative to act as the group's agent for the purpose of this subsection. Upon its approval of the application, the division shall establish a group account for the employers effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter in which it receives the application and shall notify the group's representative of the effective date of the account. The account shall remain in effect for not less than two years and thereafter until terminated at the discretion of the secretary or upon application by the group. Each group account shall be liable for the prepayment of payments in lieu of contributions as provided in Paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of Subsection B of this section. Each member of the group account shall be liable to the division for payments in lieu of contributions with respect to each calendar quarter in the amount that bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid in the quarter that are attributable to service performed in the employ of all members of the group, as the total wages paid for service in employment for such member during the quarter bear to the total wages paid during the quarter for service performed in the employ of all members of the group. The secretary shall prescribe regulations as the secretary deems necessary with respect to applications for establishment, maintenance and termination of group accounts that are authorized by this subsection, for addition of new members to and withdrawal of active members from the accounts and for the determination of the amounts that are payable under this subsection by members of the group and the time and manner of payments.\n\nF. Each group account may apportion liability for amounts due to the group representative as the group shall determine.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 59-9-7.4, enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 209, § 4; 1973, ch. 216, § 3; 1975, ch. 351, § 3; 1977, ch. 321, § 4; 1979, ch. 280, § 20; 1981, ch. 354, § 8; 1987, ch. 63, § 3; 1991, ch. 122, § 8; 2013, ch. 133, § 4.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective January 1, 2015, provided for reconciling the contributions and benefits charged to employers; in Paragraph (4) of Subsection B, in the first sentence, after \"benefits charged to such\", deleted \"employer's account\" and added \"employer\", in the second sentence, after \"benefits charged to the\", deleted \"employer's account\" and added \"employer\", and in the third sentence, after \"benefits charged to such\", deleted \"employer's account\" and added \"employer\".\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective April 3, 1991, substituted \"division\" for \"department\" throughout the section; deleted \"unemployment\" preceding \"fund\" in the first sentence in Subsection A; in Paragraph (3) of Subsection B, substituted \"one-eighth\" for \"one-fourth\" preceding \"of one percent\" in the first sentence and deleted the former second sentence, which read \"If such employer has had employment subject to benefit charges for a period of three years ending on the preceding June 30, but has incurred no benefit charges during the same three-year period, such employer shall pay to the department, each calendar quarter, an amount equal to one-eighth of one percent of the employer's annual taxable wages as estimated by the secretary\"; in Paragraph (4) of Subsection B, substituted \"quarter\" for \"year\" near the beginning of the first sentence and rewrote the final sentence, which read \"If the total payments made by an employer exceed the amount of benefits charged to such employer's account, the excess payments shall be credited as partial payment against future payments due or, if requested by the employer, shall be refunded\"; and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nExemption from payment of contributions by charitable corporationswas to be liberally construed; exemption was determined by use of property and not by declared objects and purposes of its owner; in ascertaining whether lodge was exempt, fact that half of its income was consumed in operating expenses was of no consequence; finding that lodge was organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes was supported by evidence that the half of its income not needed for operating expenses was spent for charities and that its bar, reading room and bowling alley were conducive to attendance and helped produce funds which were expended for charity.Santa Fe Lodge No. 460 v.

All money in the clearing account established under this section is hereby appropriated for the purpose of making refunds pursuant to Sections 51-1-36 and 51-1-42 NMSA 1978, and all money in the clearing account not needed for the purpose of making the refunds shall be immediately paid to the secretary of the treasury of the United States to the credit of the account of this state in the unemployment trust fund, and the money in the unemployment trust fund is hereby appropriated for the purposes of this section.\n\nG. Money shall be requisitioned from this state's account in the unemployment trust fund solely for the payment of benefits and for the payment of refunds pursuant to Sections 51-1-36 and 51-1-42 NMSA 1978 in accordance with regulations prescribed by the secretary, except that money credited to this state's account pursuant to Section 903 of the Social Security Act, as amended, shall be used exclusively as provided in Subsection H of this section. The secretary shall, from time to time, requisition from the unemployment trust fund such amounts not exceeding the amounts standing to this state's account therein, as the secretary deems necessary for the payment of such benefits and refunds for a reasonable future period. Upon receipt thereof, the treasurer shall deposit such money in the benefit account and shall issue checks for the payment of benefits solely from such benefit account. Expenditures of such money in the benefit account and refunds from the benefit account or the clearing account shall not be subject to any provisions of law requiring specific appropriations or other formal release by state officers of money in their custody. All money shall be withdrawn from the fund only upon a warrant issued by the department or its duly authorized agent upon the treasurer, and the treasurer upon receipt of such warrants shall issue a check against the fund in accordance with the warrant of the secretary. Any balance of money requisitioned from the unemployment trust fund that remains unclaimed or unpaid in the benefit account after the expiration of the period for which such sums were requisitioned shall either be deducted from estimates for, and may be utilized for, the payment of benefits and refunds during succeeding periods, or in the discretion of the secretary, shall be redeposited with the secretary of the treasury of the United States, to the credit of this state's account in the unemployment trust fund, as provided in Subsection C of this section. All money in the benefit account provided for hereinabove is hereby appropriated for the payment of benefits and refunds as provided herein.\n\nH.

Amounts credited to this state's account in the unemployment trust fund under Section 903 of the Social Security Act that are obligated for administration shall be charged against transferred amounts at the exact time the obligation is entered into. The appropriation, obligation and expenditure or other disposition of money appropriated under Subsection H of this section shall be accounted for in accordance with standards established by the United States secretary of labor.\n\nJ. Money appropriated under Subsection H of this section for payment of expenses of administration shall be requisitioned as needed for payment of the obligations incurred under such appropriations and, upon requisition, shall be deposited in the unemployment compensation administration fund but, until expended, shall remain a part of the unemployment compensation fund for use only in accordance with the conditions specified in Subsection H of this section, notwithstanding any provision of Section 51-1-34 NMSA 1978. Any money so deposited that will not be expended shall be returned promptly to the account of the state in the unemployment trust fund.\n\nK. The provisions of Subsections A through J of this section to the extent that they relate to the unemployment trust fund, shall be operative only so long as such unemployment trust fund continues to exist and so long as the secretary of the treasury of the United States continues to maintain for this state a separate book account of all funds deposited therein by the state for benefit purposes, together with this state's proportionate share of the earnings of such unemployment trust fund from which no other state is permitted to make withdrawals. If and when such unemployment trust fund ceases to exist, or such separate book account is no longer maintained, all money, properties or securities therein belonging to the unemployment compensation fund of this state shall be transferred to the treasurer of the unemployment compensation fund, who shall hold, invest, transfer, sell, deposit and release such money, properties or securities in a manner approved by the secretary, in accordance with the provisions of this section; provided that such money shall be invested in the following readily marketable classes of securities; bonds or other interest-bearing obligations of the United States and of the state; and provided further that such investment shall at all times be so made that all the assets of the fund shall always be readily convertible into cash when needed for the payment of benefits. The treasurer shall dispose of securities or other properties belonging to the unemployment compensation fund only under the direction of the secretary.\n\nHistory:Laws 1936 (S.S.), ch. 1, § 9; 1939, ch. 175, § 5; 1941 Comp., § 57-809; Laws 1941, ch. 205, § 6; 1947, ch. 209, § 4; 1953 Comp., § 59-9-9; Laws 1959, ch. 342, § 1; 1965, ch. 190, § 1; 1973, ch. 216, § 5; 1979, ch. 280, § 25; 1983, ch. 199, § 6; 1998, ch. 91, § 5; 2003, ch. 47, § 5; 2007, ch. 137, § 3; 2010, ch. 55, § 3.\n\nCross references.— For unemployment compensation administration fund,see51-1-34 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor state investment council,see6-8-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor public depositaries,see6-10-15 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor state treasurer's bond,see6-10-38 and 8-6-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor Title XII of the Social Security Act,see42 U.S.C. §§ 1321 to 1324.\n\nFor Sections 903 and 904 of the Social Security Act,see42 U.S.C. §§ 1103 and 1104.\n\nFor Section 204 of the Federal-State Extended (Unemployment) Compensation Act of 1970,seenote under 26 U.S.C. § 3304.\n\nFor the Wagner-Peyser Act,see29 U.S.C.S. § 49-49k.\n\nThe 2010 amendment,effective July 1, 2010, in Subsection A(1), deleted \"except for contributions deposited into the state unemployment trust fund pursuant to Contribution Schedule B in Paragraph (5) of Subsection I of Section 51-1-11 NMSA 1978 and Section 51-1-19.1 NMSA 1978\".\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective July 1, 2007, provides that the unemployment compensation fund does not consist of contributions deposited into the state unemployment trust fund.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective March 19, 2003, inserted \"Unemployment\" following \"Federal-State Extended\" near the end of Subsection A(7); deleted \"over\" following \"immediately paid\" near the middle of Subsection F; inserted \"and the federal Wagner-Peyser Act\" following \"Unemployment Compensation Law\" twice in Subsection H(2); added \"except for amounts distributed to the state of New Mexico on March 13, 2002 pursuant to Section 209 of the federal Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002\" at the end of Subsection H(2)(b); substituted \"Paragraph\" for \"Subparagraph\" near the beginning of Subsection H(2)(d); in Subsection K substituted \"through\" for \"B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I and\" following \"Subsections A\" and inserted \"of this section\" following \"J\" near the beginning.\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective July 1, 1998, designated Subsections C to F; redesignated former Subsections C and D as Subsections G and H; in Subsection G substituted \"Subsection H\" for \"Subsection D\" near the end of the first sentence, deleted \"thereupon\" following \"warrants shall\" in the fifth sentence, and substituted \"Subsection C\" for \"Subsection B\" in the sixth sentence; in Paragraph H(1), substituted \"Subsection G\" for Subsection C\", rewrote Subparagraph H(2)(c) and added Subparagraph H(2)(d); designated Subsections I and J and rewrote the Subsections; redesignated former Subsection E as Subsection K and inserted \"E, F, G, H, I and J\" at the beginning and deleted \"of America\" following \"United States\"; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nThree-year statute of limitations inapplicable to this section.— The contributions required to be paid under the provisions of this section are not \"revenues\" within the meaning of Section 30-1-8G NMSA 1978, which provides for a three-year statute of limitations for any crime in violation of a revenue law.Robinson v.

If, after due notice, any employer defaults in any payment of contributions or interest thereon, the amount due shall be collected by civil action in the name of the division, and the employer adjudged in default shall pay the costs of such action. Civil actions brought under this section to collect contributions or interest thereon from an employer shall be heard by the court at the earliest possible date and shall be entitled to preference on the calendar of the court, to the same extent as civil actions and appeals of civil actions brought to collect unpaid or underpaid wages, interest and any other amounts due under Section 50-4-26 NMSA 1978, over all other civil actions except petitions for judicial review under this act and worker's compensation cases arising under Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978 or in the discretion of the secretary, if any contribution or any portion thereof or any interest or penalty imposed by the Unemployment Compensation Law is not paid within thirty days after the same becomes due, the secretary shall, after due notice and opportunity to be heard in accordance with regulations, issue a warrant under its official seal, directed to the sheriff of any county of the state commanding the sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the person owning the same, found within that county, of the payment of the amount due and an added amount of ten percent of the contribution in addition to any other penalties imposed and costs of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the secretary and pay to the secretary the money collected by virtue thereof, by the time to be specified, not more than thirty days from the date of the warrant. In the event the division does not know the amount of contribution due, and the employer from whom the same is due refuses or fails to make reports showing what the employer or the division claims for the amount of contributions that the division believes to be due, and the division files the warrant for the estimated amount, mailing notice to the employer stating that the division is estimating the amount of contribution due and giving the estimated amount in the notice, the warrant and estimated amount shown shall have the same effect as any other warrant issued under this subsection. If the employer does not make a showing to the satisfaction of the secretary that the estimated amount is incorrect within thirty days after the warrant is filed with the county clerk, then the estimated amount shown in the warrant shall be and become the amount of the contribution due for the period stated in the warrant. The sheriff to whom any warrant, issued under this section, is directed shall, within five days after receipt of the same, file with the county clerk of the sheriff's county a copy thereof, for which the clerk shall make no charge, and thereupon the county clerk shall record the same upon the clerk's records and the day when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of the warrant so filed and entered shall become a lien upon all property, real and personal, of the person against whom it is issued, including choses in action, except negotiable instruments not past due; provided, however, that such lien shall be inferior to all other valid liens, encumbrances, mortgages, judgments and assessments that are filed or placed of record prior to the filing of such warrant. The sheriff or a representative of the division thereupon shall levy upon any property of the taxpayer, including negotiable instruments, and the property so levied on shall be sold in all respects with the like effect, and in the same manner as is prescribed by law with respect to executions against property upon judgments of a court of record, and the remedies of garnishment shall apply. Whenever any property or right to property upon which levy has been made is not sufficient to satisfy the claim for which levy is made, the sheriff or a representative of the division may thereafter, and as often as may be necessary, proceed to levy in like manner upon any other property or rights to property subject to levy of the person against whom the claim exists, until the amount due from the person is fully paid. The sheriff shall be entitled to the general fees for services in executing the warrant as now allowed by law for like services, to be collected in the same manner as now provided by law for like services. All costs of executing warrants including mileage of the sheriff serving and executing the same and all other costs in connection with the levy, including advertising or publication costs upon the sale of any property levied upon, shall be collected by the department from the employer from whom contribution is due.\n\nC.

In the event of an employer's adjudication in bankruptcy, judicially confirmed extension proposal, or composition, under the Federal Bankruptcy Code 11 U.S.C. Sec. 101 et seq., contributions then or thereafter due shall be entitled to such priority as is provided in the Federal Bankruptcy Code U.S.C. Title 11, Sec. 507.\n\nD. If, not later than four years after the date on which any contributions or interest thereon are paid, an employing unit that has paid such contributions or interest makes application for an adjustment in connection with subsequent contribution payments or for a refund because such adjustment cannot be made, and the secretary determines that such contributions or interest or any portion was erroneously collected, the secretary shall allow the employing unit to make an adjustment, without interest, in connection with subsequent contribution payments by the employing unit, or if such adjustment cannot be made, the secretary shall refund the amount, without interest, from the fund to which the amount was deposited. For like cause and within the same period, adjustment or refund may be so made on the secretary's own initiative.\n\nE. Any person, group of individuals, partnership or employing unit that acquires the organization, trade or business or substantially all the assets thereof from an employer shall notify the division in writing by registered mail not later than five days prior to the acquisition.

Garduno, 2014-NMCA-050, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-003.\n\nNo state statute of limitation ran against a claimby the New Mexico department of labor alleging that a debtor wrongfully collected unemployment compensation benefits while employed by failing to disclose her employment.New Mexico Dep't of Labor v.

      "heading": "Coverage of Indian tribes.",
      "text": "A. The legislature finds that:\n\n(1) the state of New Mexico recognizes and respects the Indian tribes and pueblos as governments that possess the inherent right of self-government;\n\n(2) under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, federal law now expressly exempts Indian tribes and requires that state law provide that an Indian tribe may elect to make contributions for employment or make reimbursable payments in lieu of contributions; and\n\n(3) in order to comply with the change in federal law, state law must be amended to provide for the treatment of Indian tribes under the state unemployment insurance system.\n\nB. Benefits based on service in employment of an Indian tribe, tribal unit or a subdivision, subsidiary or business enterprise wholly owned by a tribe shall be payable in the same amount, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as benefits payable on the basis of other service in employment for other employers pursuant to the Unemployment Compensation Law.\n\nC. An Indian tribe, tribal unit or a subdivision, subsidiary or business enterprise wholly owned by a tribe may make contributions in the same manner and under the same conditions as other employers or may elect to reimburse the fund with payments equal to the amounts of benefits attributable to service in the employ of the tribe, unit, subdivision, subsidiary or enterprise.\n\nD. If an Indian tribe, tribal unit or a subdivision, subsidiary or business enterprise wholly owned by a tribe elects to make payments in lieu of contributions, the following provisions shall apply:\n\n(1) as used in this section, \"electing entity\" means a tribe, tribal unit or a subdivision, subsidiary or business enterprise, wholly owned by a tribe, that elects to make payments in lieu of contributions. The tribe as a whole may be an electing entity or an individual tribal unit, subdivision, subsidiary or enterprise, or a combination of these may be electing entities;\n\n(2) an electing entity may elect to make payments in lieu of contributions by filing a written notice of its election with the division not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of the taxable year for which its election shall first be effective; except that, if an election is made prior to July 1, 2001, at the option of the electing entity the election shall be deemed to be effective December 21, 2000 or January 1, 2001; and\n\n(3) once an election is made, payments in lieu of contributions will be used by the electing entity for the following two taxable years.\n\nE. The following provisions apply to payments in lieu of contributions made by an electing entity:\n\n(1) at the end of each calendar quarter, the division shall bill each electing entity for an amount calculated pursuant to this subsection; except that, in calculating the initial payments due for an electing entity that has made an election prior to July 1, 2001, the secretary shall bill the electing entity for the period elapsed since December 21, 2000;\n\n(2) each calendar quarter, each electing entity making payments in lieu of contributions shall pay to the division an amount equal to twenty-five percent of the total benefit charges made to the electing entity during the four calendar quarters ending the preceding June 30. The due date for the payments shall be the tenth day of the first month of each calendar quarter;\n\n(3) in the event that an electing entity making payments in lieu of contributions incurred no benefit charges during the four calendar quarters ending the preceding June 30, the electing entity shall pay to the division, each calendar quarter, an amount equal to one-eighth of one percent of the electing entity's annual taxable wages paid for such period for employment as estimated by the secretary. The due date for the payments shall be the tenth day of the first month of the calendar quarter;\n\n(4) for each calendar quarter, the secretary shall determine the amount paid by each electing entity subject to payment in lieu of contributions and the amount of benefits charged to the electing entity's account; provided that an electing entity shall not be relieved of charges for benefits paid to an individual who was separated from the employ of that electing entity for any reason. Each electing entity who has made payments in an amount less than the amount of benefits charged to the electing entity's account shall pay the balance of the amount charged within twenty-five days of the notification by the division. If the quarterly payment made by an electing entity pursuant to Paragraph (2) or (3) of this subsection exceeds the amount of benefits charged to the electing entity's account, the excess payment shall be refunded on a quarterly basis;\n\n(5) payments made by an electing entity pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall not be deducted or deductible, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in the employ of the electing entity;\n\n(6) two or more electing entities may file a joint application for the establishment of a group account for the purpose of sharing the cost of benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of the entities. The application shall identify and authorize a group representative to act as the group's agent for the purpose of this paragraph. Upon its approval of the application, the division shall establish a group account for the electing entities effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter in which it receives the application and shall notify the group's representative of the effective date of the account. The account shall remain in effect for not less than two years and thereafter until terminated at the discretion of the secretary or upon application by the group. Each group account shall be liable for the prepayment of payments in lieu of contributions as provided in Paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of this subsection. Each member of the group account shall be liable to the division for payments in lieu of contributions with respect to each calendar quarter in the amount that bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid in the quarter that are attributable to service performed in the employ of all members of the group as the total wages paid for service in employment for such member during the quarter bear to the total wages paid during the quarter for service performed in the employ of all members of the group. The secretary shall prescribe rules as he deems necessary with respect to applications for establishment, maintenance and termination of group accounts that are authorized by this paragraph, for addition of new members to, and withdrawal of active members from, the accounts and for the determination of the amounts that are payable under this subsection by members of the group and the time and manner of payments. Each group account may apportion liability for amounts due to the group representative as the group shall determine; and\n\n(7) past-due payments in lieu of contributions are subject to the same penalties that are applied to past-due contributions under Section 51-1-12 NMSA 1978.\n\nF. Contributions or payments in lieu of contributions unpaid on the date on which they are due and payable shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month from and after such date until payment is received by the division. Interest collected pursuant to this subsection shall be paid into the employment security department fund.\n\nG. Any person, group of individuals, partnership or employing unit that acquires the organization, trade or business or substantially all the assets thereof from an Indian tribe or tribal entity shall notify the division in writing by registered mail not later than five days prior to the acquisition. Unless such notice is given, such acquisition shall be void as against the division, if, at the time of the acquisition, any contributions or payments in lieu of contributions are due and unpaid by the tribe or tribal entity, and the assets so acquired shall, if otherwise allowed by law, be subject to attachment for the debt.\n\nH. If an Indian tribe or a tribal entity fails to make a contribution or payment in lieu of contribution pursuant to the Unemployment Compensation Law, the division shall mail a notice of nonpayment or delinquency to the noncomplying tribe or tribal entity at its last known address as shown in division records. If the payment is not made within ninety days of the date the notice is mailed, the account of the noncomplying tribe or tribal entity shall be terminated. Notice of the termination shall be mailed to the tribe or tribal entity at its last known address shown in division records. The notice shall be accompanied by a written description of protest rights pursuant to Section 51-1-8 NMSA 1978. Termination of an account pursuant to this subsection terminates the tribe or tribal entity's participation as a contributing employer.\n\nI. The secretary may reinstate the account of an Indian tribe or tribal entity that loses coverage pursuant to Subsection H of this section if the tribe or the tribal entity pays all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, interest, penalties, surcharges and fees that are due and owing.\n\nJ. If an Indian tribe or tribal entity fails to make contributions or payments in lieu of contributions pursuant to this section, including any assessed interest and penalties, within ninety days of a notice of nonpayment or delinquency, the secretary shall immediately notify the United States internal revenue service and the United States department of labor.\n\nK. Notices of payment and reporting delinquency to an Indian tribe or a tribal entity shall include an explanation that failure to make full payment within the prescribed time will cause the tribe or the tribal entity to:\n\n(1) be liable for taxes pursuant to the Federal Unemployment Tax Act;\n\n(2) lose the option to make payments in lieu of contributions; and\n\n(3) lose its status as an employer under the Unemployment Compensation Law and will cause services performed for the tribe or tribal entity to not be treated as \"employment\" under that law.\n\nL. Extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of an Indian tribe or tribal entity and not reimbursed by the federal government shall be the responsibility of the Indian tribe or tribal entity.\n\nM. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to be a waiver of tribal sovereignty or sovereign immunity, either directly or indirectly. Compliance by an Indian tribe or tribal entity with the provisions of this section shall not be deemed to directly or indirectly waive tribal sovereignty or sovereign immunity.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 51-1-59, enacted by Laws 2001, ch. 249, § 3.\n\nCross references.— For the Federal Unemployment Tax Act,see26 U.S.C. § 3301 et seq.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2001, ch. 249 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 23, was effective June 15, 2001, 90 days after adjournment of the legislature.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2001, ch. 249, § 4 provided that the labor department shall waive any unpaid contributions, including interest and penalties, from an Indian tribe, tribal unit or a subdivision, subsidiary or business enterprise wholly owned by a tribe due between January 1, 2000 and December 21, 2000 if, before January 31, 2004, the tribe, tribal unit or subdivision, subsidiary or business enterprise pays to the unemployment compensation fund an amount equal to the total benefits actually paid from the fund between January 1, 2000 and December 21, 2000 to the employees of that tribe, tribal unit or subdivision, subsidiary or business enterprise.",
