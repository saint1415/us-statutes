The governor may grant any member of the national guard or reserves who is a state employee additional military leave with pay in excess of that allowed above, not to exceed fifteen working days per federal fiscal year, for periods of active duty for training when he deems that such training will benefit the state by enabling that employee to better perform the duties required in his state occupation.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 20-4-7, enacted by Laws 1987, ch. 318, § 24.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 1992, ch. 7, §§ 1 and 2, effective May 20, 1992, recognized the service of school district employees called to active duty by the New Mexico national guard or the United States armed forces reserves to serve in the Persian Gulf War and provided for employment compensation for those who served.\n\nLegislative objective.— The legislative objective in enacting this section was to insure that public employees who were members of organized military reserve units should not be deprived of the annual leave to which they were otherwise entitled, by reason of their absence under orders on military training. 1958 Op.
