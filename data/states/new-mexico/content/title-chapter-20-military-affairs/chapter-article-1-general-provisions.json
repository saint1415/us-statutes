If there is no money available in the state treasury that is not otherwise appropriated or if the vouchers and payrolls for such service, material and supplies approach the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000) in any one fiscal year, the state treasurer shall certify such facts to the governor who shall inquire into and make an estimate of the total probable cost necessary to be incurred for all purposes in connection with or to accomplish the purpose for which such troops were called into active service. If the governor deems it necessary and prudent in order to provide for the public defense that such expenses be incurred and that it is necessary to create an indebtedness for the purpose of paying the expenses, the governor shall by proclamation declare an emergency to exist requiring the creation of an indebtedness under Article 9, Section 7 of the constitution of New Mexico in order to suppress insurrection or to provide for the public defense. The governor shall order the issuance of certificates of indebtedness in such amount as the governor deems required or necessary to provide funds for the payment of expenses and costs incident to or connected with the emergency.\n\nC. The certificates of indebtedness shall be approved as to form by the attorney general. They shall be dated the day of their issuance and the state board of finance shall by proper resolutions prescribe the denominations of the certificates, the maturity dates thereof, the rate of interest they shall bear payable semiannually, the time and place of payment of both principal and interest and the amount of the certificates that shall be issued from time to time. The certificates shall be signed by the secretary of the state board of finance and the state treasurer and the coupons attached thereto shall have the engraved lithographed facsimile of the signature of the state treasurer thereon; provided, however, that certificates purchased by the state treasurer may be issued without coupons.

The proceeds of certificates so sold shall be by the state treasurer covered into a fund known as the \"adjutant general emergency public defense fund\" and shall be expended and disbursed only in the manner and for the purposes specified and provided for in Chapter 20, Article 1 NMSA 1978.\n\nD. A fund to be known as the \"adjutant general emergency public defense certificates fund\" to provide for the payment of interest and principal on the foregoing certificates is established and, beginning with the tax levy for the year following the issuance of the certificates, a tax shall be levied annually in the same manner as other ad valorem taxes are levied on all taxable property in the state, not to exceed one-half mill on the dollar of valuation, sufficient to produce the amount required to pay interest on the certificates and the principal thereof at maturity, for each year prior to the maturity of the certificates, which taxes when collected shall be credited to the adjutant general emergency public defense certificates fund. The state auditor shall each year prior to August 1 certify to the property tax division of the taxation and revenue department the amount necessary to meet all payments of principal and interest due on the certificates during the year ending June 30 following the date of the certificates.\n\nE.

Charlton v. French, 1940-NMSC-010, 44 N.M. 169, 99 P.2d 715.\n\nLegislative intent.— The intent of the legislature in this section is that the governor has been given the discretion to decide what is an emergency, and if he deems it necessary and prudent in order to provide for the public defense that such expenses be incurred in order to protect the lives or the property of the citizens, he may without issuing a certificate of indebtedness, if funds are available in the general fund, expend additional sums to pay for the maintaining of the militia. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6479.\n\nWhere section does not conflict.— This section does not interfere with the governor's power to call out the militia and does not conflict with N.M. Const., art. V, § 4. 1951 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 51-5438.\n\nScope of expenses for transportation.— If the adjutant general does not have sufficient transportation for the national guard, he may rent trucks for such purpose, since expenses for transportation would include and permit the renting of trucks. It would also include the repair and maintenance of state trucks, provided such repairs were incident to maintenance and not permanent in nature. 1938 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 38-1968.\n\nWhere indebtedness less than $1,000,000.— Where the indebtedness created is less than $5000 (now $1,000,000), it is to be paid out of moneys available in the state treasury not otherwise appropriated, and no certificate is to be issued in such instance unless there are no moneys available in the state treasury not otherwise appropriated. 1954 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 54-5986.\n\nExceptions to limitation on borrowing.— Limitation on the state's borrowing to meet casual deficits or failure in revenue, or for necessary expenses, does not apply to debts contracted to suppress insurrection or to provide for the public defense. 1951 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 51-5438.",
