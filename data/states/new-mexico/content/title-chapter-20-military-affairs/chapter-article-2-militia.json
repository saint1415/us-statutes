The organized militia is the national guard and the standing cadre of the state defense force and such parts of the unorganized militia when and as may be activated, enrolled or enlisted into the national guard or into the state defense force.\n\nB. The unorganized militia is comprised of all able-bodied male citizens of the state and all other able-bodied males who have or shall have declared their intentions to become citizens of the United States and are residents of the state who are not less than eighteen or more than forty-five years of age, but who shall not be more than sixty-four years of age if they shall have earlier served in or retired from the national guard; subject to the following exceptions:\n\n(1) persons exempted by the laws of the United States from federal military service;\n\n(2) persons who are engaged in civilian occupations which are deemed by the governor to be of greater public service or necessity than would be their service in the militia if called into active service of the state;\n\n(3) persons who have received dismissal, a dishonorable discharge, a bad conduct discharge, an undesirable discharge or a discharge under other than honorable conditions from any military component; and\n\n(4) persons in active federal military service or retired military members subject to federal recall to active military service.\n\nC. The adjutant general may prescribe plans by regulation for the orderly activating and detailing of the unorganized militia and its members, to include mission analysis and personnel classification. Enrollment or enlistment of members of the unorganized militia may be into the national guard, subject to federal criteria, or into the state defense force, as determined by the governor.\n\nD. The governor may authorize the voluntary appointment or voluntary enlistment of female citizens of the state into any military occupational specialty or career field of the branches and services of the organized militia that is consistent with current federal department of defense policy and while so serving they shall have the same status as male members.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 20-2-2, enacted by Laws 1987, ch. 318, § 9; 2017, ch. 43, § 1.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1987, Chapter 318 repealed former 20-2-2 NMSA 1978, as enacted by Laws 1925, ch. 113, § 2, and enacted a new section, effective April 10, 1987.\n\nThe 2017 amendment,effective June 16, 2017, authorized women to serve in any position of the organized militia; and in Subsection D, after \"female citizens of the state into\", deleted \"the noncombat\" and added \"any military occupational specialty or career field of the\", and after \"services of the organized militia\", added \"that is consistent with current federal department of defense policy\".\n\nLegislative intent.— The constitution makers did not say that the legislature should organize the militia, but mandated them to provide for the organization of the militia, and the legislature, by this chapter (Laws 1925, ch. 113), has declared its legislative policy of establishing a militia.State ex rel.

The governor may, in case of insurrection, invasion, riot or breach of the peace or of imminent danger thereof or in case of other emergency, order into active service of the state the militia or any components or parts thereof that have not been called into federal service. As used in this section, \"emergency\" includes any man-made or natural disaster causing or threatening widespread physical or economic harm that is beyond local control and requiring the resources of the state.\n\nB. The governor may also order any member of the national guard to active state service for a period not to exceed a cumulative total of four months within a calendar year for any individual member for the following reasons:\n\n(1) to protect critical infrastructure in the state from a cybersecurity threat or security vulnerability;\n\n(2) to protect an information system owned or operated by the state from a cybersecurity threat or security vulnerability;\n\n(3) to protect information that is stored on, processed by or transiting on an information system owned or operated by the state from a cybersecurity threat or security vulnerability; or\n\n(4) to identify the source of a cybersecurity threat.\n\nC. A member of the national guard called to active service pursuant to the provisions of Subsection B of this section shall not have any police powers or arrest authority. \"Subsection B of Section 20-2-3 NMSA 1978\" shall be cited on all orders, vouchers and payroll documents submitted for reimbursement pursuant to Section 20-1-6 NMSA 1978 in support of all actions authorized by Subsection B of this section. In no case shall an activation ordered pursuant to Subsection B of this section be used to incur a debt under Article 9, Section 7 of the constitution of New Mexico.\n\nD. In case of any breach of the peace, tumult, riot or resistance to process of this state or imminent danger thereof, the sheriff of a county may call for aid from the governor as commander-in-chief of the national guard. If it appears to the governor that the power of the county is insufficient to enable the sheriff to preserve the peace and protect the lives and property of the peaceful residents of the county or to overcome the resistance to process of this state, the governor shall, on application of the sheriff, order out such military force as is necessary.\n\nE. When any portion of the militia is called out for the purpose of suppressing an unlawful or riotous assembly, the commander of the troops shall cooperate with the civil officers to the fullest extent consistent with the accomplishment of the object for which the troops were called. The civil officials may express to the commander of the troops the general or specific objective that the civil officials desire to accomplish, but the tactical direction of the troops, the kind and extent of force to be used and the particular means to be employed to accomplish the object specified by the civil officers shall be left solely to the commander of the troops present on duty.\n\nF. When any portion of the militia is ordered into active service pursuant to this section in case of an emergency, the militia may provide those resources and services necessary to avoid or minimize economic or physical harm until a situation becomes stabilized and again under local self-support and control, including the provision, on a temporary, emergency basis, for lodging, sheltering, health care, food and any transportation or shipping necessary to protect lives or public property; or for any other action necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.\n\nG. In the event of the exercise by the governor of the powers under this section, the governor shall first utilize the personnel and assets of the national guard and only in their absence or insufficiency utilize the personnel and assets of the state defense force.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 20-2-3, enacted by Laws 1987, ch. 318, § 10; 1999, ch. 140, § 3; 2017, ch. 93, § 1.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1987, Chapter 318 repealed former 20-2-3 NMSA 1978, as enacted by Laws 1943, ch. 29, § 1, relating to the definition of militia, and enacted a new section, effective April 10, 1987.\n\nCross references.— For constitutional power of governor to call out militia,seeN.M. Const., art. V, § 4.\n\nThe 2017 amendment,effective April 6, 2017, authorized the activation of the national guard in the case of cybersecurity threats, placed limits on the authority exercised pursuant to such activation, and prohibited the incurrence of debt for such activations; added new Subsections B and C, and redesignated the succeeding subsections accordingly; and in Subsection F, after \"health care, food\", added \"and\".\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, added the last sentence in Subsection A, added Subsection D, redesignated former Subsection D as Subsection E and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nGenerally.— When acting within the power vested in him by N.M. Const., art. V, § 4 and this section, the governor may order into active service the militia of the state and may direct locality of operations. He is made the sole judge of the facts that may seem to demand the assistance of the military forces of the state. The presumption of course is that he will not exercise this power unless it becomes necessary. To his good judgment and sound discretion, the law has left the final decision as to whether the military arm of the state shall be ordered into active service. There is no power in the courts to control or restrain his acts.State ex rel. Charlton v. French, 1940-NMSC-010, 44 N.M. 169, 99 P.2d 715.\n\nEffects of using militia.— Where the governor of the state, seeking to quell insurrection, calls out the militia by executive process and puts them in charge, such military forces do not act as sheriffs or deputy sheriffs, but their power supersedes the civil authorities; the courts may not, under writs of habeas corpus, interfere with their arrests made during insurrection.State ex rel. Roberts v. Swope, 1933-NMSC-097, 38 N.M. 53, 28 P.2d 4.\n\nQuartering of men and equipment.— Governor may expend money to quarter men and equipment of national guard, although men and equipment are not engaged in active duty.State ex rel. Charlton v. French, 1940-NMSC-010, 44 N.M. 169, 99 P.2d 715.\n\nConverting and quartering of cavalry.— Governor may convert cavalry into a mechanized unit in an emergency to provide better for the public defense, and may order armories altered to quarter same.State ex rel. Charlton v. French, 1940-NMSC-010, 44 N.M. 169, 99 P.2d 715.\n\nEnlistment generally.— A voluntary enlistment is a contractual relationship between the person enlisting and the state.
