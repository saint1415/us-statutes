      "text": "All deeds, mortgages, leases of an initial term plus option terms in excess of five years, or memoranda of the material terms of such leases, assignments or amendments to such leases, leasehold mortgages, United States patents and other writings affecting the title to real estate shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk of the county or counties in which the real estate affected thereby is situated. Leases of any term or memoranda of the material terms thereof, assignments or amendments thereto may be recorded in the manner provided in this section. As used in this section, \"memoranda of the material terms of a lease\" means a memorandum containing the names and mailing addresses of all lessors, lessees or assignees; if known, a description of the real property subject to the lease; and the terms of the lease, including the initial term and the term or terms of all renewal options, if any.\n\nHistory:Laws 1886-1887, ch. 10, § 1; C.L. 1897, § 3953; Code 1915, § 4786; C.S. 1929, § 118-108; 1941 Comp., § 13-201; 1953 Comp., § 71-2-1; 1991, ch. 234, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 1991, ch. 234, § 4 defined \"leasehold\" to mean an estate in real estate or real property held under a lease and validates as correct and legally effective filings or recordings to give constructive notice any actions taken prior to April 4, 1991 to file or record leases, memoranda, assignments or amendments thereto, leasehold mortgages or other writings affecting leaseholds or any interests in leaseholds in accordance with legal requirements for the filing or recording of writings affecting the title to real estate or real property.\n\nCross references.— For filing municipal assessment liens,see3-36-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor notice of possession of public land of United States,see19-3-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor townsite patents,see19-4-1 to 19-4-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor recording assignment of mortgages,see48-7-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor record of survey requirements,see61-23-28.2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor filing and recording of changes of ownership in water rights,see72-1-2.1.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective April 4, 1991, added the catchline; inserted \"leases of an initial term plus option terms in excess of five years, or memoranda of the material terms of such leases, assignments or amendments to such leases, leasehold mortgages\" in the first sentence; and added the second sentence.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nPurpose.— Sections 14-9-1 and 14-9-3 NMSA 1978 are not intended to protect creditors of the owners of property, but to impart information to those dealing with the property respecting its transfer and encumbrances.First Nat'l Bank v. Haverkampf, 1911-NMSC-053, 16 N.M. 497, 121 P. 31,aff'd, 235 U.S. 689, 35 S. Ct. 204, 59 L. Ed. 426 (1914);Ilfeld v. de Baca, 1905-NMSC-007, 13 N.M. 32, 79 P. 723,rev'd on other grounds, 1907-NMSC-014, 14 N.M. 65, 89 P. 244 (decided prior to 1923 amendment of 14-9-3 NMSA 1978).\n\nFunction of recording statutes.— In loans of money secured by property, recording statutes provide for notice to other potential lenders and indicate the upper limits of financing.New Mexico Bank & Trust Co. v. Lucas Bros., 1978-NMSC-062, 92 N.M. 2, 582 P.2d 379.\n\nCertainty afforded by recording.— Because potential lenders rely upon recorded mortgages to determine whether to make other loans, there must be certainty as to the extent to which a mortgage encumbers property.New Mexico Bank & Trust Co. v. Lucas Bros., 1978-NMSC-062, 92 N.M. 2, 582 P.2d 379 (decided on facts which occurred prior to passage of 48-7-9 NMSA 1978).\n\nPetitioner was not entitled to the protection of the Recording Act.— Where husband and wife executed a promissory note secured by a mortgage on real property in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and where the mortgage was signed by both husband and wife, but where the promissory note was signed only by husband, and where husband also signed a quitclaim deed, which was recorded in Santa Fe county in 2017, in favor of himself and wife, and where, in 2018, a court in California entered a judgment dissolving the marriage of husband and wife and adopting a marital settlement agreement stipulated by the parties that divided their assets and stated that the real property in Santa Fe was separate property purchased by husband before the marriage, and where, in 2018, plaintiff filed a complaint for foreclosure on the property and received a default judgment after none of the defendants answered the complaint, and where the property was sold at auction in 2019 to a limited liability corporation (LLC), the sale of which was approved by the district court, and where, prior to the court's approval of the sale, husband assigned his right of redemption to petitioner TAL Realty and wife assigned her right of redemption and issued a quitclaim deed for her right of redemption to the LLC on September 4, 2019, both of which were recorded with the county clerk on September 9, 2019, and wife also assigned her right of redemption to petitioner Kaushal on September 20, 2019, and where petitioners filed competing petitions for redemption of the property, and where petitioner Kaushal argued that he was a good faith purchaser or a subsequent innocent purchaser for value entitled to the protection of the Recording Act because county records showed that the property was owned jointly by husband and wife, petitioner Kaushal's argument was without merit, because regardless of the efficacy of the quitclaim deed from wife to the LLC on September 4, 2019, petitioner Kaushal was on constructive notice that there was some sort of cloud on the title of wife's right of redemption at that time, and yet still purchased wife's right of redemption. As such, petitioner Kaushal was not a good faith purchaser when he was assigned wife's right of redemption on September 20, 2019, and cannot claim the protections of the Recording Act.Nationstar Mortgage v. Kaushal, 2023-NMCA-051.\n\nNo time requirement for recording instruments.— There is no requirement that an instrument be recorded within a particular period of time; the order in which deeds appear on the record is not important in a notice jurisdiction.Angle v. Slayton, 1985-NMSC-032, 102 N.M. 521, 697 P.2d 940.\n\nII. APPLICABILITY TO PARTICULAR INSTRUMENTS.\n\nThe recording act applies to tax deeds.The recording act does not apply to tax liens.Cano v. Lovato, 1986-NMCA-043, 105 N.M. 522, 734 P.2d 762, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 246, 716 P.2d 1267, cert. quashed, 105 N.M. 438, 733 P.2d 1321 (1987).\n\nThe recording act does not apply to tax liens.Cano v. Lovato, 1986-NMCA-043, 105 N.M. 522, 734 P.2d 762, cert. denied, 104 N.M. 246, 716 P.2d 1267, cert. quashed, 105 N.M. 438, 733 P.2d 1321 (1987).\n\nProvisions applicable to Mexican land grants.— This article applies to Mexican land grants.Yeast v. Pru, 292 F. 598 (D.N.M. 1923).\n\nProvisions applicable to mortgages.— Mortgages affecting real estate are governed by this section.Shafer v. McCulloh, 1934-NMSC-012, 38 N.M. 179, 29 P.2d 486.\n\nProvisions not applicable to assignments of mortgages.— Sections 14-9-1 to 14-9-3 NMSA 1978 do not require the recordation of an assignment of a mortgage securing the payment of a negotiable promissory note, to protect the holder from payments made by the mortgagor, or subsequent purchaser, to the original mortgagee.Hayden v. Speakman, 1914-NMSC-077, 20 N.M. 513, 150 P. 292.\n\nAssignment of unrecorded land contract.— The assignment of an unrecorded land contract, which assignment was neither acknowledged nor proven in any form to entitle it to be recorded, is not such an instrument as this section requires to be placed of record.Early Times Distillery Co. v. Zeiger, 1902-NMSC-001, 11 N.M. 221, 67 P. 734.\n\nExecutory contracts entitled to record.— An executory contract of sale of real estate, when duly executed and acknowledged, is a writing entitled to record.McBee v. O'Connell, 1911-NMSC-049, 16 N.M. 469, 120 P. 734, appeal after remand 1914-NMSC-088, 19 N.M. 565, 145 P. 123\n\nApplicability to revocable trusts.— The protection afforded by the New Mexico recording acts is inapplicable to a revocable trust that does not affect the title to the original property.Withers v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1981-NMCA-032, 96 N.M. 71, 628 P.2d 316.\n\nRestrictive covenant running with the land shall be enforced.— Where venture company owned 116 acres of property and split the property into four tracts, imposing identical restrictive covenants upon each tract when it was sold that prohibited each tract from being divided into parcels of less than five acres and that specifically stated that the restrictive covenant ran with the land, and where defendants purchased a five-acre parcel within one of the four tracts and sold two and one-half acres of their five-acre parcel, the district court did not err in enforcing the restrictive covenant on behalf of adjacent landowners, because a restrictive covenant that runs with the land binds the covenantor's successors in interest and applying the general rule that covenants burdening land sold under a general plan of restriction can be enforced by one landowner against another within a subdivision.Cobb v. Gammon, 2017-NMCA-022.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Survey of New Mexico Law, 1979-80: Property,\" see 11 N.M. L. Rev. 203 (1981).\n\nFor annual survey of New Mexico Law of Property, see 20 N.M.L.

      "text": "Such records shall be notice to all the world of the existence and contents of the instruments so recorded from the time of recording.\n\nHistory:Laws 1886-1887, ch. 10, § 2; C.L. 1897, § 3954; Code 1915, § 4787; C.S. 1929, § 118-109; 1941 Comp., § 13-202; 1953 Comp., § 71-2-2.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For recording assignment of royalties,see70-1-1, 70-1-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nFalse or void instruments.— Only valid instruments are authorized to be filed or recorded, of which purchasers are charged with notice and if a false or void instrument purporting upon its face to be conveyance is recorded, the record, like the instrument, is void and does not protect a purchaser.Mosley v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 1941-NMSC-028, 45 N.M. 230, 114 P.2d 740.\n\nPurpose.— Sections 14-9-1 and 14-9-3 NMSA 1978 are not intended to protect creditors of the owners of property, but to impart information to those dealing with the property respecting its transfer and encumbrances.First Nat'l Bank v. Haverkampf, 1911-NMSC-053, 16 N.M. 497, 121 P. 31,aff'd, 235 U.S. 689, 35 S. Ct. 204, 59 L. Ed. 426 (1914);Ilfeld v. de Baca, 1905-NMSC-007, 13 N.M. 32, 79 P. 723,rev'd on other grounds, 1907-NMSC-014, 14 N.M. 65, 89 P. 244 (decided prior to 1923 amendment of 14-9-3 NMSA 1978).\n\nA deed recorded in a countywhere the property is not located is ineffective as constructive notice.Christmas v. Cowden, 1940-NMSC-051, 44 N.M. 517, 105 P.2d 484.\n\nSeller under real estate contract holds perfected interest in propertyby virtue of recording his interest pursuant to this article.Connelly v. Wertz, 1993-NMCA-090, 115 N.M. 803, 858 P.2d 1282,overruled on other grounds,Southwest Land Inv., Inc. v. Hubbart, 1993-NMSC-072, 116 N.M. 742, 867 P.2d 412.\n\nAll documents affecting title to real property recorded in county records are constructive notice to the world of their existence from the time of recordation.Brown v. Behles & Davis, 2004-NMCA-028, 135 N.M. 180, 86 P.3d 605.\n\nNo time requirement for recording instruments.— There is no requirement that an instrument be recorded within a particular period of time; the order in which deeds appear on the record is not important in a notice jurisdiction.Angle v. Slayton, 1985-NMSC-032, 102 N.M. 521, 697 P.2d 940.\n\nConstrued in pari materia.— This section must be considered with 14-9-3 NMSA 1978, with which it is in pari materia.Romero v. Sanchez, 1971-NMSC-129, 83 N.M. 358, 492 P.2d 140.\n\nNecessity of notice.— To bind a purchaser of a servient estate by a servitude charged thereon, he must have notice thereof, either actual or constructive, as in case of other encumbrances upon land.Southern Union Gas Co. v. Cantrell, 1952-NMSC-024, 56 N.M. 184, 241 P.2d 1209.\n\nService by publication against \"unknown claimants of interest\"in quiet title action does not affect the title of a person whose deed to that property is on record in the deed records of the county in which the real estate in question is located.Houchen v. Hubbell, 1969-NMSC-162, 80 N.M. 764, 461 P.2d 413.\n\nConstructive service proper where names and addresses of defendants are not reasonably ascertainable.— In a collateral attack on a 1948 quiet title judgment in San Juan county, in which service of process was accomplished by publication in a weekly newspaper, and where the plaintiffs in the 1948 complaint alleged that after diligent search and inquiry, they had been unable to learn or determine the names, places of residence, addresses and whereabouts of any unknown heirs of any deceased defendants or if any defendants were still living and residing in New Mexico, they could not be located because they had secreted themselves so that personal service of process could not be effected, and where the return of service completed by the sheriff of San Juan county indicated that after diligent search and inquiry, any predecessors-in-interest could not be located and personally served with process, the district court correctly found that the suit in this case constituted an improper collateral attack on the 1948 judgment quieting title in defendants' predecessors-in-interest, because constructive notice given in the underlying case was sufficiently reasonably calculated under the circumstances as they existed in 1948; constructive service of process by publication satisfies due process if the names and addresses of the defendants to be served are not reasonably ascertainable.T.H. McElvain Oil & Gas Ltd. P'ship v. Benson-Montin-Greer Drilling Corp., 2017-NMSC-004,rev'g2015-NMCA-004, 340 P.3d 1277.\n\nLack of notice.— This section does not impose a duty upon the owner of an interest in real property to constantly peruse the records of the county clerk to determine whether he or she has been divested of his or her property right in a lawsuit of which he or she was not notified.T.H. McElvain Oil & Gas Ltd. P'ship v. Benson-Montin-Greer Drilling Corp., 2015-NMCA-004, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-012.\n\nQuiet title action.— In quiet title action, where defendants failed to undertake a diligent and good faith effort to personally serve the owners of an interest in real property with adequate notice of quiet title suit, constructive notice was not constitutionally adequate.T.H. McElvain Oil & Gas Ltd. P'ship v. Benson-Montin-Greer Drilling Corp., 2015-NMCA-004, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-012.\n\nAppropriations for judicial salaries are subject to governor's veto power.— Judicial salaries must annually be established by the legislature in an appropriations act, as set forth in Subsection E of 34-1-9 NMSA 1978, and are subject to the governor's partial veto authority.State ex rel. Cisneros v. Martinez, 2015-NMSC-001.\n\nGovernor's partial veto must eliminate the whole of an item to be valid.— Where the legislature provided for two separate judicial raises in two separate appropriations, the governor's partial veto of one appropriation failed to eliminate the second appropriation providing for judicial raises.State ex rel. Cisneros v. Martinez, 2015-NMSC-001.\n\nFraud.— The recording of a deed must be accompanied by other circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person upon inquiry in order for the recording to act as constructive notice of fraud.Romero v. Sanchez, 1971-NMSC-129, 83 N.M. 358, 492 P.2d 140.\n\nFailure to record mortgage promptlydoes not constitute a fraud in law as to subsequent creditors.First Nat'l Bank v. Haverkampf, 1911-NMSC-053, 16 N.M. 497, 121 P. 31,aff'd, 235 U.S. 689, 35 S. Ct. 204, 59 L. Ed. 426 (1914).\n\nDate of recording tax sale certificate does not affect period of redemption.Hiltscher v. Jones, 1917-NMSC-089, 23 N.M. 674, 170 P. 884, appeal dismissed, 251 U.S. 545, 40 S. Ct. 218, 64 L. Ed. 407 (1920).\n\nRecorded deed of trust was superior to the unrecorded interest of an investorwho admitted he had actual notice of the recorded interest, and the existing priorities were not affected by the appointment of a receiver.Kuntsman v. Guaranteed Equities, Inc., 1986-NMSC-083, 105 N.M. 49, 728 P.2d 459.\n\nEstoppel.— Where defendant and her husband had entered into a property settlement agreement which provided that after-acquired property would belong exclusively to the acquiring party and such recorded agreement was later repudiated by defendant in a recorded affidavit, but later ratified and confirmed in another recorded affidavit, plaintiffs, who had purchased property from husband, were innocent purchasers for value and entitled to rely on the record, and defendant was estopped by her conduct from asserting the invalidity of the property settlement.Allison v. Curtis, 1957-NMSC-036, 62 N.M. 387, 310 P.2d 1042.\n\nPriority of interests in bankruptcy.— Since priority of interest of competing lienholders is determined by the date of recording under New Mexico's recording statutes (Sections 14-9-1 to 14-9-3 NMSA 1978), the second mortgage on debtor's property, as the only recorded lien of record, had priority over the trustee's interest as unperfected lienholder after avoidance of first mortgage holder's unrecorded and therefore unperfected security interest.In re Beltramo, 367 B.R. 825 (Bankr. D.N.M. 2007).\n\nII. PERSONS CHARGED WITH NOTICE.\n\nLand ownership and well-sharing agreement.— Where the owners of adjoining ranches entered into a written land ownership and well-sharing agreement to clarify the ownership of certain property and to provide for sharing of water from two wells; the agreement was recorded in each county in which the land and wells were located; and one landowner sold the landowner's ranch to a third party and orally advised the buyer of the existence of the agreement, the buyer had constructive notice of the agreement and had a duty to inquire about the agreement.Skeen v. Boyles, 2009-NMCA-080, 146 N.M. 627, 213 P.3d 531.\n\nConstructive notice of restrictive covenant in deed.— Because a deed containing a restrictive covenant was recorded, the defendant had constructive notice of the covenant.Lex Pro Corp. v. Snyder Enters., Inc., 1983-NMSC-073, 100 N.M. 389, 671 P.2d 637.\n\nConstructive notice in recorded deed of trust.— Pursuant to the policy underlying the recording statutes, Sections 14-9-1 and -2 NMSA 1978, priority in the proceeds of collateral underlying petitioners' loans would be determined by the order in which the deeds of trust were recorded; there was no question that the \"master\" deed of trust issued to Group I was duly recorded first and that the latter deeds were expressly made subject to it, so the investors in Group II and Group III thus had record notice of the existence of the first deed of trust, in addition to actual notice in some cases.McInerny v. Peterson, 1986-NMSC-099, 105 N.M. 207, 730 P.2d 1189.\n\n\"All the world\" means those bound to search record.— \"All the world\" has been limited to mean those persons who are bound to search the record, and it is to such persons only that the law imputes constructive notice; subsequent purchasers are charged with such notice.Angle v. Slayton, 1985-NMSC-032, 102 N.M. 521, 697 P.2d 940.\n\nConstructive notice to subsequent purchasers.— Subsequent purchasers are charged with such constructive notice of the contents of recorded instruments pursuant to Section 14-9-2 NMSA 1978, since the term \"all the world\" has been limited to mean persons who are bound to search the record, and it is only these persons that the law imputes with constructive notice.Allen v. Timberlake Ranch Landowners Ass'n, 2005-NMCA-115, 138 N.M. 318, 119 P.3d 743.\n\nConstructive notice to laborers.— Claimants had constructive notice that title to the real estate upon which they allegedly performed labor had been previously conveyed to the grantee, where two deeds given to the grantee were both filed and recorded.In re Estates of Salas, 1987-NMCA-018, 105 N.M. 472, 734 P.2d 250.\n\nRecord of instrument is constructive notice to subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers onlyand does not affect prior parties.Romero v. Sanchez, 1971-NMSC-129, 83 N.M. 358, 492 P.2d 140.\n\nWho bound to search.— Those who, by the terms of the recording laws, are charged with constructive notice of the record of an instrument affecting land are, therefore, those who are bound to search the records for that particular instrument.Romero v. Sanchez, 1971-NMSC-129, 83 N.M. 358, 492 P.2d 140.\n\nJury question.— If, considering all the surrounding facts and circumstances, a reasonably prudent person in the exercise of ordinary diligence would have made inquiry as to the state of the record, he is chargeable with knowledge that such inquiry would have revealed from the time that it ought to have been made. This raises a factual issue for resolution by the trier of the facts.Romero v. Sanchez, 1971-NMSC-129, 83 N.M. 358, 492 P.2d 140.\n\nIII. SCOPE OF NOTICE.\n\nScope of notice.— Where information of a specific claim or right is given to a person or to the world by recordation of an instrument manifesting such claim or right, the information contained therein is operative only in respect to the particular facts communicated thereby, and it will not serve to put the parties charged with such notice upon inquiry as to any other or different right.Zumwalt v. Goodwin, 133 F.2d 984 (10th Cir. 1943).\n\n\"Knowledge\"does not necessarily mean \"actual knowledge,\" but means knowledge of such circumstances as would ordinarily lead to a knowledge of the actual facts. In its broadest interpretation, it means constructive notice. Recitals in a quitclaim deed of existence of agreements, rights of redemption and mortgages charged the grantee with notice of an unrecorded warranty deed.Taylor v. Hanchett Oil Co., 1933-NMSC-099, 37 N.M. 606, 27 P.2d 59.\n\nPerson who files and records leases long after others sued to foreclosevendor's lien for balance of the purchase price and filed lis pendens notice in same county clerk's office is deemed to have notice that his interest was attacked in the action, and his interest is inferior to the lien of the vendor.Logan v. Emro Chem. Corp., 1944-NMSC-044, 48 N.M. 368, 151 P.2d 329.\n\nEffect of recording agreement.— Purchaser's written agreement to execute a second mortgage on property when buildings were constructed on the land, or within one year from date of sale, when filed for record, constituted constructive notice to all the world of its existence and contents.Zumwalt v. Goodwin, 133 F.2d 984 (10th Cir. 1943).\n\nAn agreement as notice of a vendor's lien.— Vendor's recordation of agreement with buyer of vacant land that when buildings were erected or in one year after date of sale buyer was to give vendor a second mortgage on the property did not give constructive notice to a surety on the buyer's note of the vendor's intention to reserve a vendor's lien, and a mortgage executed to the surety to secure his signature to a renewal note had priority over the vendor's lien.Zumwalt v. Goodwin, 133 F.2d 984 (10th Cir. 1943).\n\nRecording of short form memorandum of agreementgave notice that defendant was claiming some right to real estate under this section.Bingaman v. Cook, 1968-NMSC-187, 79 N.M. 627, 447 P.2d 507.\n\nReference in contract to improvement agreement.— An unrecorded improvement agreement, referred to in a recorded contract of sale, is in the chain of title.Camino Real Enters., Inc. v. Ortega, 1988-NMSC-061, 107 N.M. 387, 758 P.2d 801.\n\nRecorded chattel mortgage of crops to be raised is constructive noticeof the existence and contents of the mortgage, even though the land is generally but not particularly described, where description could be aided by reasonable inquiry.Security State Bank v. Clovis Mill & Elevator Co., 1937-NMSC-029, 41 N.M. 341, 68 P.2d 918.\n\nReliance on record.— An investigator may rely upon the truth of recitals contained in the record when they are specific.Smith & Ricker v. Hill Bros., 1913-NMSC-004, 17 N.M. 415, 134 P. 243.\n\nPriority of claims in bankruptcy.— Pursuant to New Mexico recordation statute (Section 14-9-1 NMSA 1978), the ownership interests of the debtor and his wife as to good faith purchasers and judgment lien creditors were delineated by the recorded deed stating that they owned the subject property as joint tenants.In re Beery, 295 B.R. 385 (Bankr. D.N.M. 2003).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 28 Am. Jur. 2d Estoppel and Waiver §§ 90, 96; 66 Am. Jur. 2d Records and Recording Laws §§ 88, 102 to 155; 77 Am.

      "text": "No deed, mortgage or other instrument in writing not recorded in accordance with Section 14-9-1 NMSA 1978 shall affect the title or rights to, in any real estate, of any purchaser, mortgagee in good faith or judgment lien creditor, without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments. Possession alone based on an unrecorded executory real estate contract shall not be construed against any subsequent purchaser, mortgagee in good faith or judgment lien creditor either to impute knowledge of or to impose the duty to inquire about the possession or the provisions of the instruments.\n\nHistory:Laws 1886-1887, ch. 10, § 3; C.L. 1897, § 3955; Code 1915, § 4788; Laws 1923, ch. 11, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 118-110; 1941 Comp., § 13-203; 1953 Comp., § 71-2-3; Laws 1990, ch. 72, § 1.\n\nThe 1990 amendment,effective May 16, 1990, substituted \"Section 14-9-1 NMSA 1978\" for \"Section 4786\" in the first sentence and added the second sentence.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nApplicability.— This section is applicable only in situations where two deeds purport to convey the same property.Grammer v. New Mexico Credit Corp., 1957-NMSC-018, 62 N.M. 243, 308 P.2d 573.\n\nThis section applies to tax deeds.Cano v. Lovato, 1986-NMCA-043, 105 N.M. 522, 734 P.2d 762.\n\nInapplicability to tax liens.— A tax lien is not within the class of written instruments governed by this section.Cano v. Lovato, 1986-NMCA-043, 105 N.M. 522, 734 P.2d 762.\n\nConstrued in pari materia.— Section 14-9-2 NMSA 1978 must be considered with this section with which it is in pari materia.Romero v. Sanchez, 1971-NMSC-129, 83 N.M. 358, 492 P.2d 140.\n\nApplicability to revocable trusts.— The protection afforded by the New Mexico recording acts is inapplicable to a revocable trust that does not affect the title to the original property.Withers v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1981-NMCA-032, 96 N.M. 71, 628 P.2d 316.\n\nWord \"purchaser\"has two well defined meanings, the common and popular meaning being that he is one who obtains title to real estate in consideration of the payment of money or its equivalent, and the other being technical and including all persons who acquire real estate otherwise than by descent, which includes acquisition by devise, and the word is used in the recording statute in its popular sense.Arias v. Springer, 1938-NMSC-025, 42 N.M. 350, 78 P.2d 153; Withers v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 96 N.M. 71, 628 P.2d 316.\n\nIntermittent or occasional use of land is insufficient to operate as noticeto a purchaser.Ortiz v. Jacquez, 1966-NMSC-243, 77 N.M. 155, 420 P.2d 305.\n\nAny conflict between 40-3-13 NMSA 1978, requiring joinder of spouses, and this sectionshould be resolved in favor of this section which protects the rights of innocent purchasers for value without notice of unrecorded instruments.Jeffers v. Martinez, 1979-NMSC-083, 93 N.M. 508, 601 P.2d 1204, appeal after remand, 1982-NMSC-116, 99 N.M. 351, 658 P.2d 426.\n\nSection does not require deeds to be acknowledged.Garcia v. Leal, 1924-NMSC-078, 30 N.M. 249, 231 P. 631.\n\nAcknowledgment is not essentialto validity of deed of conveyance as between its parties.Kitchen v. Canavan, 1932-NMSC-037, 36 N.M. 273, 13 P.2d 877.\n\nVerbal consent to assignment.— A party's verbal consent to an assignment of an interest in a real estate contract is not a substitute for perfection of that interest by recording.Mazer v. Jones, 184 B.R. 377 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1995).\n\nPriority of recorded judgment lien.— Although it has been held that the 1923 amendment of this section did not affect the priority of an unrecorded mortgage over a recorded judgment lien, yet as between them taking effect simultaneously, since the law of 1923 took effect, the recorded judgment lien has priority.Fulghum v. Madrid, 1927-NMSC-064, 33 N.M. 303, 265 P. 454.\n\nEffect of failure to record.— A deed of land, though not recorded, is good between grantor and grantee, and divests the title of the former, so that it does not pass to a subsequent grantee, or mortgagee, who takes only the estate which belongs to the grantor at the time.Ames v. Robert, 1913-NMSC-021, 17 N.M. 609, 131 P. 994.\n\nRequirement tax deeds to be recorded not applicable.— Where a deed issued by state tax commission to an individual conveyed land which had previously been conveyed by the county treasurer to the state in pursuance of a tax sale to the state, the deed from the tax commission is not a tax deed and the requirement that tax deeds must be recorded within a year after their issuance is not applicable thereto.Hargrove v. Lucas, 1952-NMSC-043, 56 N.M. 323, 243 P.2d 623.\n\nII. PERSONS PROTECTED.\n\nEffect of correction deeds referencing easement extinguishment agreement.— Where a five-acre tract was burdened by an access easement that benefitted an adjoining twenty-two acre tract; the original owner of both tracts sold the five-acre tract to defendants and on March 5, 2001, the original owner executed an extinguishment agreement terminating the easement across the five-acre tract; the extinguishment agreement provided that it would be effective upon recordation in the county records; two days later, on March 7, defendants recorded the deed to the five-acre tract which described the land as burdened by the easement; the original owner sold the twenty-two acre tract to a third party; on April 25, the third party recorded its deed; on April 30, defendants recorded the extinguishment agreement; the third party was a bona fide purchaser without notice of the extinguishment agreement; two years later, the third party sold the twenty-two acre tract to plaintiff; and at plaintiff's insistence, corrected deeds between the original owner and the third party, and the third party and plaintiff incorporated by reference the extinguishment agreement, the extinguishment agreement was valid when recorded and by correcting its deeds to incorporate the extinguishment agreement, plaintiff forfeited its protection under the recording statutes and its right to the easement across the five-acre tract.Amethyst Land Co., Inc. v. Terhune, 2014-NMSC-015,rev'g2013-NMCA-059, 304 P.3d 434.\n\nFailure to promptly record extinguishment of easement.— Where access to plaintiff's 22 acre tract was provided by a forty foot roadway easement on an adjoining five acre tract that was owned by defendants; on February 16, 2001, the common owner of both tracts signed a warranty deed conveying the five acre tract to defendants, expressly subject to the forty foot easement, on March 5, 2001, the common owner signed an extinguishment agreement to terminate the forty foot easement; on March 7, 2001, defendants' warranty deed was recorded; on March 20, 2011, the common owner gave a special warranty deed to the 22 acre tract to plaintiff's predecessor in title which did not mention the forty foot easement or the extinguishment agreement; on April 12, 2001, defendants signed the extinguishment agreement; on April 25, 2001, plaintiff's predecessor recorded the special warranty deed to the 22 acre tract; on April 30, 2001, defendants recorded the extinguishment agreement; two years later, plaintiff acquired the 22 acre tract by quitclaim deed which plaintiff recorded on April 30, 2003; and plaintiff's predecessor did not have actual or inquiry notice of the extinguishment agreement when the predecessor acquired the 22 acre tract, plaintiff's predecessor was a bona fide purchaser without notice of the extinguishment agreement and acquired title to the 22 acre tract free of the extinguishment agreement, the 22 acre tract continued to be benefitted by the forty foot easement, plaintiff acquired the property interests and rights of its predecessor, including the forty foot easement, and the extinguishment agreement was ineffective against plaintiff.Amethyst Land Co., Inc. v. Terhune, 2013-NMCA-059, 304 P.3d 434,rev'd, 2014-NMSC-015.\n\nCorrection deeds referencing an ineffective easement extinguishment agreement did not revive the easement.— Where access to plaintiff's 22 acre tract was provided by a forty foot roadway easement on an adjoining five acre tract that was owned by defendants; when defendants acquired the five acre tract, the common owner of both tracts signed an extinguishment agreement to terminate the forty foot easement; before the extinguishment agreement was recorded, the common owner sold the 22 acre tract to plaintiff's predecessor in title who was unaware of the extinguishment agreement and who later sold the 22 acre tract to plaintiff; plaintiff's predecessor and plaintiff acquired title to the 22 acre tract free of the extinguishment agreement; and after plaintiff acquired the 22 acre tract, plaintiff's attorney searched the record and prepared correction deeds from the common owner to plaintiff's predecessor and from plaintiff's predecessor to plaintiff which expressly included the forty foot easement and stated that the easement was partially vacated by the extinguishment agreement, the correction deeds did not revive the extinguishment agreement or otherwise terminate the forty foot easement.Amethyst Land Co., Inc. v. Terhune, 2013-NMCA-059, 304 P.3d 434,rev'd, 2014-NMSC-015.\n\nPurchases and mortgages.— Prior to the amendment of 1923, the recording laws were for the protection of purchasers and mortgagees only.Wells v. Dice, 1929-NMSC-008, 33 N.M. 647, 275 P. 90.\n\nAttachment creditors.— An unrecorded conveyance protected only subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith and without notice, but did not protect attachment creditors.Chetham-Strode v. Blake, 1914-NMSC-067, 19 N.M. 335, 142 P. 1130.\n\nInvestors and judgment creditors.— The object of the recording statute is to prevent injustice by protecting those who, without knowledge of infirmities in the title, invest money in property or mortgage loans and those who have acquired judgment liens without such knowledge.Arias v. Springer, 1938-NMSC-025, 42 N.M. 350, 78 P.2d 153.\n\nPurchaser, mortgagee, or judgment creditor.— In order to avail himself of the protection of this section, a party must be a purchaser, mortgagee in good faith, or a judgment lien creditor of the land in question.Withers v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1981-NMCA-032, 96 N.M. 71, 628 P.2d 316.\n\nGift recipients.— Because persons who have not given consideration in exchange for the title to property cannot invoke the recording statute, summary judgment in an action involving defendant's claim of title to property pursuant to the recording statute was in error where plaintiff raised the factual issue of whether the defendant acquired the property by gift.Valencia v. Lundgren, 2000-NMCA-045, 129 N.M. 57, 1 P.3d 975.\n\nTest whether one had implied knowledgeis whether he exercised the ordinary care of a purchaser of a federal oil and gas lease.O'Kane v. Walker, 561 F.2d 207 (10th Cir. 1977).\n\nOil and gas lease.— Purchaser exercised the ordinary care expected of a purchaser of a federal oil and gas lease where careful investigation of the records showed record title in the offeror, the price was low, but not unreasonably so in view of the short remaining lease term and the highly speculative nature of the investment, and purchaser was a bona fide purchaser, without actual or implied knowledge of any facts which would have put him on notice of an unrecorded conveyance.O'Kane v. Walker, 561 F.2d 207 (10th Cir. 1977).\n\nEquitable principles require that innocent purchaser should prevailover one who negligently fails to record a deed upon which he seeks to rely.Jeffers v. Martinez, 1979-NMSC-083, 93 N.M. 508, 601 P.2d 1204, appeal after remand, 1982-NMSC-116, 99 N.M. 351, 658 P.2d 426.\n\nEquitable principles require that innocent purchaser should prevailover one who negligently fails to record a deed upon which he seeks to rely.Jeffers v. Martinez, 1979-NMSC-083, 93 N.M. 508, 601 P.2d 1204, appeal after remand, 1982-NMSC-116, 99 N.M. 351, 658 P.2d 426.\n\nUnrecorded chattel mortgage.— A chattel mortgage is good between the parties and against purchasers with notice although unrecorded.Kitchen v. Schuster, 1907-NMSC-021, 14 N.M. 164, 89 P. 261.\n\nUnrecorded plat.— Where the developer submitted a preliminary plat that described a ten-acre parcel as open space; the municipality instructed the developer to designate the parcel as a \"drainage easement\" as a surrogate term for \"open space\" and the municipality relied on the developer's representation that the parcel would be set aside as open space in perpetuity; the preliminary plat was not recorded; the final recorded plat designated the parcel as a drainage easement; and the developer sold the parcel to a buyer who had no knowledge of the unrecorded interest of the municipality, the recorded plat unambiguously granted the municipality an easement for the specific purpose of drainage thereby extinguishing any unrecorded interests and relieving the subsequent buyer, who was a good faith purchaser for value, from the duty to diligently investigate whether the municipality had other adverse claims to the property title.City of Rio Rancho v. Amrep Sw., Inc., 2011-NMSC-037, 260 P.3d 414,aff'g in part,rev'g in part2010-NMCA-075, 148 N.M. 542, 238 P.3d 911.\n\nQuiet title suit.— In suit to quiet title, where plaintiff and defendant both derive their titles from the same grantor, and defendant purchased in good faith, for value and had no knowledge of the outstanding unrecorded deed of his grantor to plaintiff's grantor, defendant had the better title, notwithstanding the fact that he took a quitclaim deed.Mabie-Lowrey Hdwe. Co. v. Ross, 1920-NMSC-026, 26 N.M. 51, 189 P. 42.\n\nOral agreement.— If one is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of another's claimed interest, then the oral agreement would be of no effect as to him even if it be treated as an enforceable agreement as between the other person and the vendor.Ortiz v. Jacquez, 1966-NMSC-243, 77 N.M. 155, 420 P.2d 305.\n\nIII. PARTICULAR CASES.\n\nDeeds.— Where land conveyed by unrecorded deed was within larger tract subsequently conveyed by grantor to another and was not specifically excepted from operation of later deed, both deeds purported to convey same land and this section was applicable, and later grantee did not have constructive notice of unrecorded deed.Grammer v. New Mexico Credit Corp., 1957-NMSC-018, 62 N.M. 243, 308 P.2d 573.\n\nResiduary legatee.— Where grantor delivered deed to third party with instructions to retain the same in her possession until grantor died, and then to deliver it to grantee, and imposed no conditions, retained no right to recall the deed and exercised no control over it thereafter, grantor's residuary legatee and devisee was not a purchaser within meaning of recording statute, and could not claim title as against the deed, though unrecorded.Arias v. Springer, 1938-NMSC-025, 42 N.M. 350, 78 P.2d 153.\n\nConstructive notice.— A lien on real estate resulting from a recorded transcript of judgment does not have priority over the interest of purchasers under an earlier executed but unrecorded contract, where the lienholder has constructive notice of the purchasers' interest through the purchasers' actual possession of the property.Citizens Bank v. Hodges, 1988-NMCA-001, 107 N.M. 329, 757 P.2d 799, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 74, 752 P.2d 789.\n\nPartnership certificate as constructive notice.— In the absence of a recorded deed at the time plaintiff's judgment lien attached, defendant's partnership's certificate could not function as constructive notice to plaintiff of plaintiff's conveyance of the realty at issue to a partnership he formed with another party, since the partnership certificate at issue was filed with records other than those relating to property transfers, and defendant's name was not associated with the partnership in the index to those records.F & S Co. v. Gentry, 1985-NMSC-065, 103 N.M. 54, 702 P.2d 999.\n\nReversionary interest.— Where a mortgagor entered into an executory contract to sell his land nearly six years prior to his execution of the mortgage, so that the only interest he still owned in such real estate involved a possibility of a reverter to him in the event of a default in payment of the real estate contract, the mortgagee's bank had actual notice of the facts and did not assign to the bank any interest in the unpaid balance of the real estate contract, the trial court properly concluded, as a matter of law, that the only lien the bank acquired was on the possible reversionary interest, and accordingly, since the mortgage did not \"attach to\" the real property, the trial court correctly concluded that the bank was not entitled to foreclose the mortgage.First Nat'l Bank v. Luce, 1974-NMSC-098, 87 N.M. 94, 529 P.2d 760.\n\nReformation of deed not to affect rights of innocent purchaser.— Because there was no evidence that a judgment lienholder had any notice of a claimed mistake in a deed until she attempted to execute her judgment, the court was correct in ruling that any reformation of the deed was not effective against her rights.Ruybalid v. Segura, 1988-NMCA-084, 107 N.M. 660, 763 P.2d 369.\n\nAcknowledgment of assignment on back of executory contractfor sale of real estate, to which the assignment refers for particular description, is not an acknowledgment of the contract, and although the contract was copied into the record, that did not make it of record, nor constructive notice to a subsequent purchaser having no actual knowledge of it.McBee v. O'Connell, 1911-NMSC-049, 16 N.M. 469, 120 P. 734, appeal after remand, 1914-NMSC-088, 19 N.M. 565, 145 P. 123.\n\nInnocent purchaser for value.— Plaintiff was an innocent purchaser for value, under 14-9-1 to 14-9-3 NMSA 1978, of oil and gas lease interests since the records at the federal land office did not constitute constructive notice or prior assignment which plaintiff had no knowledge of, and the assignment was not recorded in the appropriate county clerk's office, as required by 70-1-1 and 70-1-2 NMSA 1978.Bolack v. Underwood, 340 F.2d 816 (10th Cir. 1965).\n\nRights of a judgment lien creditorwere held fixed by condition of affairs as they existed at time of inception of his lien. They were not affected by a subsequent conveyance which debtor could not have been coerced by courts to make.Sylvanus v. Pruett, 1932-NMSC-002, 36 N.M. 112, 9 P.2d 142.\n\nJudgment lien was held superiorto alleged mortgage lien claimed under altered warranty deed by party whose name had been inserted as grantee therein. Scheer v. Stolz, 1937-NMSC-070, 41 N.M. 585, 72 P.2d 606.\n\nPrescriptive title cannot be obtainedby adverse user based on a written, but unrecorded, grant.Southern Union Gas Co. v. Cantrell, 1952-NMSC-024, 56 N.M. 184, 241 P.2d 1209.\n\nGas easement.— Where gas company acquired easement for right-of-way by written instrument which was not recorded and the easement was not visible or open, a third-party purchaser, without knowledge of the easement, was not bound thereby, since gas company did not have prescriptive easement in the land.Southern Union Gas Co. v. Cantrell, 1952-NMSC-024, 56 N.M. 184, 241 P.2d 1209.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part II,\" see 2 Nat.
