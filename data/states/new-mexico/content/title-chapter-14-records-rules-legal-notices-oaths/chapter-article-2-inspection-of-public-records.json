GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nRetroactive application of the Supreme Court decision in Republication Party v. Taxation & Revenue.— Where, in 2007, plaintiff requested copies of a draft letter and emails relating to a federal program managed by defendant and defendant denied plaintiff's request on the grounds that the documents were protected by the deliberative process privilege and the rule of reason, the principles of Republican Party of N.M. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2012-NMSC-026, 283 P.3d 853 applied retroactively to plaintiff's request because the supreme court did not announce a new rule regarding the deliberative process privilege, and although the supreme court overruled cases in which the rule of reason was endorsed, defendant did not rely on the precedent overruled by the supreme court when it denied plaintiff's request, retroactive application of the decision would further the purposes of the Inspection of Public Records Act, and retroactive application of the decision would not result in any inequity.Edenburn v. N.M. Dep't of Health, 2013-NMCA-045, 299 P.3d 424, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-002.\n\nRule of reason.— The rule of reason is a non-statutory exception to disclosure which provides a mechanism for addressing claims of confidentiality that have not been specifically addressed by the legislature. The rule of reason applies only to public records that do not fall into one of the statutory exceptions to disclosure and requires the custodian of public records to justify why the records sought to be inspected should not be furnished and the district court to balance the fundamental right of all citizens to have reasonable access to public records against countervailing public policy considerations which favor confidentiality and nondisclosure.City of Farmington v. The Daily Times, 2009-NMCA-057, 146 N.M. 349, 210 P.3d 246.\n\nInspection of Public Records Act is statutory scheme of general application.Crutchfield v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2005-NMCA-022, 137 N.M. 26, 106 P.3d 1273.\n\nCitizen complaints concerning law enforcement officer.— Citizen complaints concerning the on-duty conduct of a law enforcement officer are public records available to the public for inspection.Cox v. N.M. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2010-NMCA-096, 148 N.M. 934, 242 P.3d 501, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-010, 149 N.M. 64, 243 P.3d 1146, cert. quashed, 2011-NMCERT-006, 150 N.M. 763, 266 P.3d 632.\n\nRight of citizen to inspect.— A citizen has a fundamental right to have access to public records. The citizen's right to know is the rule, and secrecy is the exception. Where there is no contrary statute or countervailing public policy, the right to inspect public records must be freely allowed.State ex rel. Newsome v. Alarid, 1977-NMSC-076, 90 N.M. 790, 568 P.2d 1236.\n\nNondisclosure of names of terminated employees.— Where the reason for termination of public employees is a matter of public knowledge before the individuals are terminated, the privacy of the disciplinary proceeding can only be protected by upholding the administrative decision not to disclose the names of the individuals affected.State ex rel. Barber v. McCotter, 1987-NMSC-046, 106 N.M. 1, 738 P.2d 119.\n\nDefendant failed to meet burden of establishing privilege in request for public records action.— In an underlying enforcement action under the New Mexico Inspection of Public Records Act, 14-2-1 to -12 NMSA 1978, where plaintiffs made a combined seven written requests of the Albuquerque public schools (APS) to inspect documents referencing complaints or allegations of misconduct regarding the former superintendent of APS, the district court did not err in ordering the non-party appellant to answer plaintiffs' deposition questions, because appellant failed to identify any privilege, either adopted by the New Mexico supreme court or recognized under the New Mexico constitution, on which to base her argument that communications regarding \"limited personnel matters\" that occur during a closed public meeting are immune from discovery, and failed to meet her burden of establishing the essential elements necessary to prove the applicability of the attorney-client privilege, based on a claimed common interest, to her communications with APS attorneys.Albuquerque Journal v. Board of Educ., 2019-NMCA-012,cert. granted.\n\nA state agency is a \"person\", for purposes of IPRA, and may request public records from other state agencies.— Where the state ethics commission (commission) sent a public records request, pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA), NMSA 1978, §§ 14-2-1 to -12, to the New Mexico human services department [health care authority department] (department), asking the department to provide copies of certain emails from several named employees, and where the department denied the request claiming that the commission, itself a \"public body\" for the purposes of IPRA, is not a \"person\" entitled to make public records requests, the department erred in denying the commission's public records request, because a public body is an \"entity,\" within the definition of \"person,\" § 14-2-6(D), and therefore the plain language of IPRA demonstrates that public bodies can submit public records requests to other public bodies. This reading of the statute is also consistent with IPRA's declared purpose, that all persons are entitled to the greatest possible information regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of public officers and employees.Public Records Requests Made by the State Ethics Comm'n(10/27/21), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2021-12.\n\nThe Electronic Communications Privacy Act is not an exception to disclosure of public records.— Where the state ethics commission (commission) sent a public records request to the New Mexico human services department [health care authority department] (department), asking the department to provide copies of certain emails from several named employees, and where the department denied the request claiming that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), NMSA 1978, § 10-16F-1 to -6, operates as an exception to disclosure through the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA), NMSA 1978, §§ 14-2-1 to -12, because the commission may obtain the requested records through a subpoena, the department erred in denying the commission's public records request, because the commission's ability to obtain pubic records through a subpoena does not mean that it is unable to seek the same records through IPRA, and nothing in the ECPA's text suggests that the legislature intended the statute to operate as an exception to disclosure through IPRA.Public Records Requests Made by the State Ethics Comm'n(10/27/21), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2021-12.\n\nII. RECORDS SUBJECT TO INSPECTION.\n\nPleading an action for enforcement of IPRA against a private entity.— To plead an action for enforcement of the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA), 14-2-1 to 14-2-12 NMSA 1978, against a private entity, a plaintiff must simply allege that the records sought are public records arising out of the private entity's performance of a public function and that the private entity has failed to comply with IPRA via the manner outlined in either 14-2-11(C) NMSA 1978 or 14-2-12(D) NMSA 1978.Franklin v. Keefe Commissary Network, 2024-NMCA-070.\n\nRecords arising out of a private entity's performance of a public function and on behalf of a public entity are subject to IPRA.— Where plaintiff, a state inmate, requested records regarding commissary prices for state prisoners, pursuant to the New Mexico Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA), 14-2-1 to 14-2-12 NMSA 1978, from defendant, a private corporation contracting with the New Mexico corrections department (NMCD) to operate an inmate commissary program at New Mexico state facilities, based on plaintiff's belief that prices were not set at fair market value, and where, upon receiving no response from defendant, plaintiff filed a complaint to enforce IPRA, and where defendant filed a pretrial motion to dismiss, arguing that defendant was not subject to IPRA because it is a private entity, the district court erred in granting defendant's motion to dismiss, because the records sought were public records arising out of defendant's performance of a public function and on behalf of a public entity. Plaintiff established under the facts of the complaint that defendant may be subject to IPRA.Franklin v. Keefe Commissary Network, 2024-NMCA-070.\n\nProperty valuation records.— The valuation records statute, § 7-38-19, expressly recognizes that valuation records are public records except to the extent that they contain information regarding income, certain expenses, profits and losses relating to the property or owner, or diagrams of the interior arrangements of buildings or alarm, electrical, or plumbing systems; the presence of any of the above information on a property card does not render the entire card excepted from being a public record, since such a literal reading of the statute is unreasonable and would effect a nullification of the statutes providing that valuation records are, in general, public.Gordon v. Sandoval Cnty. Assessor, 2001-NMCA-044, 130 N.M. 573, 28 P.3d 1114.\n\nVoter registration records.— A county chairman of a political party is entitled to have the working master record of the voter registration records of the county copied, or duplicated at his expense under the county clerk's supervision, as these records are public records.Ortiz v. Jaramillo, 1971-NMSC-041, 82 N.M. 445, 483 P.2d 500.\n\nMilitary and arrest records of state employees.— Supreme court declined to hold that all information in employment records of state university regarding military discharges or arrest records should be exempted from disclosure.State ex rel. Newsome v. Alarid, 1977-NMSC-076, 90 N.M. 790, 568 P.2d 1236.\n\nIII. EXCEPTIONS.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nRule of reason has no application to the inspection of public records.— The rule of reason, whereby courts determine whether records not specifically exempted by the Inspection of Public Records Act, Section 14-2-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., nevertheless should be withheld from the requestor on the grounds that disclosure would not be in the public interest, has no application to the inspection of public records under the act. Courts should restrict their analysis to whether disclosure under the act may be withheld because of a specific exception contained within the act, or statutory or regulatory exceptions, or privileges adopted by the supreme court or grounded in the constitution.Republican Party of N.M. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2012-NMSC-026, 283 P.3d 853,overrulingCity of Farmington v. The Daily Times, 2009-NMCA-057, 146 N.M. 349, 210 P.3d 246 andBoard of Comm'rs of Dona Ana Cnty. v. Las Cruces Sun-News, 2003-NMCA-102, 134 N.M. 283, 76 P.3d 36.\n\nThe deliberative process privilege does not exist under New Mexico law.— The common law deliberative process privilege, which applies to decision making of executive officials generally and which only covers material that is predecisional and deliberative, does not exist under New Mexico law.Republican Party of N.M. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2012-NMSC-026, 283 P.3d 853,rev'g2010-NMCA-080, 148 N.M. 877, 242 P.3d 444 and disavowingState ex rel. Att'y Gen. v. First Judicial Dist. Court, 1981-NMSC-053, 96 N.M. 254, 629 P.2d 330.\n\nExecutive privilege.— The executive privilege in New Mexico, which derives from the constitution and which is reserved to and can be invoked only by the governor, extends only to documents that are communicative in nature, that are made to and from individuals in very close organizational and functional proximity to the governor, and that relate to decisions made by the governor in the performance of the governor's constitutionally-mandated duties.Republican Party of N.M. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2012-NMSC-026, 283 P.3d 853.\n\nApplication of the executive privilege to the inspection of public records.— Courts considering the application of the executive privilege to a request for the inspection of public records under the Inspection of Public Records Act, Section 14-2-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., must independently determine whether the documents at issue are in fact covered by the privilege and whether the privilege has been invoked by the governor, to whom the privilege is reserved. Courts are not required to balance the competing needs of the executive and the party seeking disclosure. Where appropriate, courts should conduct an in camera view of the documents at issue as part of their evaluation of the privilege.Republican Party of N.M. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2012-NMSC-026, 283 P.3d 853.\n\nExecutive privilege did not apply to drivers' license records.— Where petitioners requested public documents from the motor vehicle division relating to the issuance of drivers' licenses to foreign nationals and to an audit of the license program ordered by the governor; the motor vehicle division redacted information pursuant to executive privilege; the redacted documents included communications regarding New Mexico's negotiations with the Mexican government regarding access to identity documents and discussions related to implementing the audit of the driver's license program; the documents at issue were principally internal emails between staff of the motor vehicle division, not communications with the governor or the governor's immediate staff; and the motor vehicle division, not the governor, asserted the executive privilege; the documents at issue did not qualify for the executive privilege.Republican Party of N.M. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2012-NMSC-026, 283 P.3d 853,rev'g2010-NMCA-080, 148 N.M. 877, 242 P.3d 444.\n\nDriver's license records.— Where plaintiffs, who wanted to research whether undocumented aliens were voting in elections in New Mexico, requested information about driver's licenses issued to persons who were not citizens or legal residents of the United States, defendants properly redacted individual tax identification numbers and the names, driver's license numbers, and addresses of drivers who obtained their license with proof of identification other than a social security number, because the redacted information was personal information which defendants were prohibited from disclosing by 18 U.S.C. § 2721(a)(1) and by Section 66-2-7.1 NMSA 1978.Republican Party of N.M. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2010-NMCA-080, 148 N.M. 877, 242 P.3d 444, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-008, 148 N.M. 942, 242 P.3d 1288.\n\nExecutive privilegeis a non-statutory exception to disclosure which requires the court to balance the fundamental right of all citizens to have reasonable access to public records against countervailing public policy considerations which favor confidentiality and nondisclosure.Republican Party of N.M. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2010-NMCA-080, 148 N.M. 877, 242 P.3d 444, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-008, 148 N.M. 942, 242 P.3d 1288.\n\nExecutive privilege.— Where plaintiffs, who wanted to research whether undocumented aliens were voting in elections in New Mexico, requested information about driver's licenses issued to persons who were not citizens or legal residents of the United States, defendants were authorized by the executive privilege exception to redact communications between the governor's office and the defendants regarding New Mexico's negotiations with the Mexican government regarding driver's identification confirmation, discussions about drivers who applied for licenses using documents whose authenticity the motor vehicle division had not been able to confirm, and discussions related to an audit to determine whether licenses had been issued to individuals who submitted documents of questionable authenticity.Republican Party of N.M. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2010-NMCA-080, 148 N.M. 877, 242 P.3d 444, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-008, 148 N.M. 942, 242 P.3d 1288.\n\nAttorney-client privilege.— Where plaintiffs, who wanted to research whether undocumented aliens were voting in elections in New Mexico, requested information about driver's licenses issued to persons who were not citizens or legal residents of the United States, defendants were authorized by the attorney-client privilege exception to redact communications between the general counsel for the governor's office and executive branch personnel about communications with the Mexican government regarding the issuance of driver's licenses in New Mexico, an audit of drivers who obtained licenses with individual tax identification numbers, communications with drivers whose documentation could not be verified, and legal analysis of the process for obtaining a driver's license.Republican Party of N.M. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2010-NMCA-080, 148 N.M. 877, 242 P.3d 444, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-008, 148 N.M. 942, 242 P.3d 1288.\n\nAttorney-client privilege exemption.— Where plaintiff sued the board of commissioners for Sandoval county and the Sandoval county records custodian, claiming that defendants violated IPRA by denying her the opportunity to inspect certain records, including emails sent between the county's public information officer and the county manager concerning IPRA lawsuits involving the county and the county's processing of IPRA requests, and where, after an in camera review of three emails that were not produced by the county, the district court issued its order, determining that all three emails were protected from disclosure by attorney-client privilege, the district court erred in exempting the first email, because although the email contained the designation \"Attorney-Client Privileged\" the email was not made for the purpose of facilitating or providing professional legal services, but rather to apprise its recipients of a decision which the public information officer had previously made concerning an IPRA request, but the district court did not err in exempting the second and third emails which summarized conversations between the public information officer and attorneys for the county, and the general rule is that a communication relaying privileged legal advice between representatives of an organization client who can act on that advice qualifies as being made for the purpose of facilitating or providing professional legal services to that client.Tawater v. Board of Comm'rs, 2023-NMCA-052.\n\nSection 6-5A-1(D) NMSA 1978 does not serve as a statutory exemption to the Inspection of Public Records Act.— In consolidated appeals arising from two lawsuits brought by plaintiff against defendants, the university of New Mexico foundation, the university of New Mexico lobo club, and the board of regents of the university of New Mexico, under the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA), §§ 14-2-1 through 14-2-12 NMSA 1978, seeking donor lists and records and communications related to a naming agreement between the university of New Mexico and a restaurant chain that obtained naming rights to a major sporting facility operated by the university, and where defendants argued that these records were exempt from disclosure under Section 6-5A-1 NMSA 1978 and that the records were not public records under IPRA, the district court did not err in ruling that § 6-5A-1(D) did not function as an exemption to IPRA, because a plain reading of § 6-5A-1 establishes that the legislature expressly designated organizations' annual audits as public records, but also made clear that it was not doing the same for other records. Thus, while an organization's records might be public records subject to inspection, § 6-5A-1 does not specifically exempt any records from disclosure.Libit v. UNM Lobo Club, 2022-NMCA-043, cert. granted.\n\nB. PARTICULAR RECORDS EXCEPTED.\n\nDraft documents are public documents that are subject to public inspection.Edenburn v. N.M. Dep't of Health, 2013-NMCA-045, 299 P.3d 424, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-002.\n\nDraft letter and emails.— Where plaintiff requested a copy of a draft letter and a string of emails that related to a federal program managed by defendant; defendant denied plaintiff the right to inspect the emails on the ground that the emails were protected by the deliberative process privilege because they were deliberative communications between defendant's employees before any final determinations were made; and defendant denied plaintiff the right to inspect the draft letter on the grounds that the draft letter, as a draft document, was not subject to public records status and was exempt from disclosure by the rule of reason and the same principles upon which the deliberative process privilege is grounded, the draft letter and the emails were subject to disclosure because neither the deliberative process privilege nor the rule of reason are recognized in New Mexico and there was no specific statutory, regulatory, court adopted privilege, or constitutional provision that exempts draft documents from inspection.Edenburn v. N.M. Dep't of Health, 2013-NMCA-045, 299 P.3d 424, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-002.\n\nThe contents of an officeholder's personal election campaign Facebook page are not public records of a public body.— In a superintending control proceeding arising from an Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) action filed in the fifth judicial district court (district court), where the real party in interest, a party to a civil case in the first judicial district court, sought to inspect the contents of a personal election Facebook page maintained by a first judicial district court judge (judge), the district court did not err in determining that the contents of the judge's personal election campaign Facebook page were not public records of a public body subject to IPRA disclosure requirements, because IPRA is aimed at the affairs of government and the official acts of public officers and employees, and there was no evidence that the judge's personal election campaign or its Facebook site were acting on behalf of the first judicial district court or any other public body, that any government funding was involved in maintenance of the Facebook site or any of its activities, or that the judge conducted public business through the site.Pacheco v. Hudson, 2018-NMSC-022.\n\nJudicial deliberation privilege.— There exists a judicial deliberation privilege protecting the confidentiality of draft judicial orders and other internal judicial-making processes between judges and between judges and the court's staff made in the course of the performance of their judicial duties and related to official court business.Pacheco v. Hudson, 2018-NMSC-022.\n\nIn a superintending control proceeding arising from an Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) action filed in the fifth judicial district court (district court), where the real party in interest, a party to a civil case in the first judicial district court, sought to inspect email communications related to a draft copy of a preliminary injunction order that a judge in the first judicial district court had been preparing for issuance in the underlying civil case, email exchanges between the judge and court staff, as well as an email exchange between the judge and the supreme court law librarian, were protected by the judicial deliberation privilege, because the email exchanges reflected the judge's internal judicial decision-making processes.Pacheco v. Hudson, 2018-NMSC-022.\n\nChild abuse and neglect proceedings.— Section 32A-4-33 NMSA 1978 of the Children's Code exempts the child's records in a civil abuse and neglect proceeding from the public's right to inspect public records authorized by Section 14-2-1(F) NMSA 1978 (1993) (now 14-2-1(A)(12) NMSA 1978).State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v. George F., 1998-NMCA-119, 125 N.M. 597, 964 P.2d 158.\n\nCriminal investigation records.— The legislature has expressed its intent to protect from disclosure police investigatory materials in an on-going criminal investigation through the Inspection of Public Records Act (Section 14-2-1(A)(4) NMSA 1978).Estate of Romero v. City of Santa Fe, 2006-NMSC-028, 139 N.M. 671, 137 P.3d 611.\n\nThere is not a blanket exception from inspection for law enforcement records relating to an ongoing criminal investigation.— Where plaintiff sent a written request to the department of public safety (DPS) pursuant to IPRA for various records relating to the shooting death of his brother, and where DPS produced a primary incident report, the personnel records of one of the officers involved, and one subpoena, but denied production of all other pertinent records in its possession, claiming that the release of the requested information posed a demonstrable and serious threat to an ongoing criminal investigation and that the FBI asked DPS to withhold the records in order to maintain the integrity of its investigation, the district court erred in denying plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and in granting DPS's motion for summary judgment, because this section does not create a blanket exception from inspection of law enforcement records relating to an ongoing criminal investigation, and DPS did not present evidence that any specific records that it refused to produce revealed confidential sources, methods, information or individuals accused but not charged with a crime, nor did DPS present any evidence that it reviewed the requested records to separate the exempt from nonexempt information, or that it provided any nonexempt information existing within records containing exempt information.Jones v. N.M. Dep't of Public Safety, 2020-NMSC-013,rev'gNo. A-1-CA-35120, mem. op. (May 10, 2018) (non-precedential).\n\nProperty valuation records.— The valuation records statute, Section 7-38-19 NMSA 1978, expressly recognizes that valuation records are public records except to the extent that they contain information regarding income, certain expenses, profits and losses relating to the property or owner, or diagrams of the interior arrangements of buildings or alarm, electrical, or plumbing systems; the presence of any of the above information on a property card does not render the entire card excepted from being a public record, since such a literal reading of the statute is unreasonable and would effect a nullification of the statutes providing that valuation records are, in general, public.Gordon v. Sandoval Cnty. Assessor, 2001-NMCA-044, 130 N.M. 573, 28 P.3d 1114.\n\nDriver's license records.— Where plaintiffs, who wanted to research whether undocumented aliens were voting in elections in New Mexico, requested information about drivers' licenses issued to persons who were not citizens or legal residents of the United States, defendants properly redacted individual tax identification numbers and the names, drivers' license numbers, and addresses of drivers who obtained their license with proof of identification other than a social security number, because the redacted information was personal information which defendants were prohibited from disclosing by 18 U.S.C. § 2721(a)(1) and by Section 66-2-7.1 NMSA 1978.Republican Party of N.M. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2010-NMCA-080, 148 N.M. 877, 242 P.3d 444, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-008, 148 N.M. 942, 242 P.3d 1288.\n\nComputerized database of public record.— There is no intent on the part of the legislature with respect to Section 14-3-15.1 C NMSA 1978 that that statute and the policy underlying it, and not the Inspection of Public Records Act and the policies underlying it, apply to a copy of a medium containing a computerized database of a public record.Crutchfield v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2005-NMCA-022, 137 N.M. 26, 106 P.3d 1273.\n\nLetters of reference.— A letter of reference, as that term is used in Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of Section 14-2-1 NMSA 1978, is generally considered to be a statement of support for an applicant that assists a future employer or licensor in evaluation of an applicant for a job, license, or permit; is typically solicited either by a prospective applicant or the prospective employer; and addresses the prospective applicant's general qualifications for employment or licensing.Cox v. N.M. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2010-NMCA-096, 148 N.M. 934, 242 P.3d 501, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-010, 149 N.M. 64, 243 P.3d 1146, cert. quashed, 2011-NMCERT-006, 150 N.M. 763, 266 P.3d 632.\n\nCitizen complaints concerning law enforcement officer.— Citizen complaints concerning the on-duty conduct of a law enforcement officer are not letters of reference as that term is used in Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of Section 14-2-1 NMSA 1978.Cox v. N.M. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2010-NMCA-096, 148 N.M. 934, 242 P.3d 501, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-010, 149 N.M. 64, 243 P.3d 1146, cert. quashed, 2011-NMCERT-006, 150 N.M. 763, 266 P.3d 632.\n\nRecords in personnel files.— The location of a record in a personnel file is not dispositive of whether the exception in Paragraph (3) of Subsection A of Section 14-2-1 NMSA 1978 applies. The critical factor is the nature of the document itself.Cox v. N.M. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2010-NMCA-096, 148 N.M. 934, 242 P.3d 501, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-010, 149 N.M. 64, 243 P.3d 1146, cert. quashed, 2011-NMCERT-006, 150 N.M. 763, 266 P.3d 632.\n\nMatters of opinion in personnel files.— Matters of opinion in personnel files, as that term is used in Paragraph (3) of Subsection A of Section 14-2-1 NMSA 1978, constitute personnel information regarding the employer/employee relationship, such as internal evaluations; disciplinary reports or documentation; promotion, demotion or termination information; or performance evaluations.Cox v. N.M. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2010-NMCA-096, 148 N.M. 934, 242 P.3d 501, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-010, 149 N.M. 64, 243 P.3d 1146, cert. quashed, 2011-NMCERT-006, 150 N.M. 763, 266 P.3d 632.\n\nException for letters and memoranda apply to entire document.— Where plaintiff filed a complaint in district court seeking a writ of mandamus or a court order compelling the livestock board (board) to disclose an investigative report produced by an outside firm retained by the board to investigate allegations that a particular board inspector had committed timesheet fraud by billing the board for his time while working at a second job, and where plaintiff claimed that the board's custodian of records was required to separate \"matters of fact\" from \"matters of opinion\" in the report and produce the matters of fact for inspection, the district court did not err in granting the board's motion for summary judgment, because the plain language of the exemption in NMSA 1978, 14-2-1(C) applies to letters or memoranda that are matters of opinion in personnel files in their entirety, and NMSA 1978, 14-2-9(A), by its plain language, does not require a custodian of records to separate exempt from nonexempt information when an exemption applies to a document as a whole, which § 14-2-1(C) does.Henry v. Gauman, 2023-NMCA-078, cert. denied.\n\nDocuments that included privileged attorney-client communications and report made for the purpose of determining whether to take disciplinary action against an employee were exempt from disclosure.— Where plaintiff, a citizen journalist and advocate, whose work focuses on estray and wild horses, matters within the jurisdiction of the livestock board (board), sought disclosure of certain records related to wild horses that included communications between the board's general counsel, attorneys in the attorney general's office and certain board staff members and the disclosure of records pertaining to a formal investigation of the deputy board director and the human resources director for allegedly creating a hostile work environment and misappropriating funds, and where the district court held that none of the four documents at issue were exempt and ordered them disclosed, the district court erred in finding that none of the documents were exempt from disclosure, because three of the documents were confidential communications between lawyers representing the board made for the purpose of facilitating or providing professional legal services to the board and therefore exempt from disclosure pursuant to NMSA 1978, § 14-2-1(G), and the fourth document, a report of an investigation into alleged misconduct by an employee of the board prepared for the purpose of determining whether to take disciplinary action against that employee, fell within the matters of opinion in personnel files exemption under § 14-2-1(C).Henry v. N.M. Livestock Bd., 2023-NMCA-082, cert. denied.\n\nInternal affairs investigation documents fell within \"letters or memoranda which are matters of opinion in personnel files\" exception.— Where petitioner made an Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) request to the City of Carlsbad, in relevant part, for all internal affairs reports and investigative files, concerning as targets, or as witnesses, fourteen city police officers identified by name, all communication records relating to the processing and completion of the internal affairs investigation report concerning petitioner, and city notices to city police officers of certain types of discipline from 2015 through the date of the request, and where the city identified 3,777 pages of documents responsive to petitioner's request, but withheld 3,271 pages as exempt under 14-2-1(C) NMSA 1978, and where the district court, after argument and independently examining the documentsin camera, found that the documents were created for the purpose of conducting internal disciplinary proceedings and determined that the documents were properly withheld and exempt pursuant to 14-2-1(C) NMSA 1978, the district court did not err in finding that the documents were exempt, because internal affairs investigation documents that concern employee infractions or disciplinary action are exempt from disclosure under IPRA. When a law enforcement officer's employer performs an internal affairs investigation to investigate violations of the officer's terms of employment for the purpose of determining whether infractions occurred and whether disciplinary action should be taken, documents and reports prepared in furtherance of the investigation fall squarely within the \"letters and memoranda that are matters of opinion in personnel files\" exemption.Hall v. City of Carlsbad, 2023-NMCA-042.\n\nCitizen complaints concerning law enforcement officer.— Citizen complaints regarding a law enforcement officer's conduct while performing the officer's duties as a public official are not the type of opinion material this is excluded from public inspection by Paragraph (3) of Subsection A of Section 14-2-1 NMSA 1978.Cox v. N.M. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2010-NMCA-096, 148 N.M. 934, 242 P.3d 501, cert. granted, 2010-NMCERT-010, 149 N.M. 64, 243 P.3d 1146, cert. quashed, 2011-NMCERT-006, 150 N.M. 763, 266 P.3d 632.\n\nRecords of non-mandated university employment office.— Student complaints against man who utilized the services of university employment office to obtain domestic help by means of job postings were not \"public records,\" since there was no legal mandate for the operation of the employment office, nor was there an obligation of the office to make or keep records of the complaints.Spadaro v. Univ. of N.M. Bd. of Regents, 1988-NMSC-064, 107 N.M. 402, 759 P.2d 189.\n\nPersonnel records of state university employees pertaining to illness may be confidential.— Personnel records of employees of state university which pertain to illness, injury, disability, inability to perform a job task and sick leave are considered confidential under this section and not subject to release to the public, except by the consent or waiver of the particular employee.State ex rel. Newsome v. Alarid, 1977-NMSC-076, 90 N.M. 790, 568 P.2d 1236.\n\nFaculty salary mattersare not public records until the culmination of the contract between the board and the individual thought processes, or the offer of a contract, are not such a public record as would require public inspection, so that the right to inspect records of the board of regents of a state university on the subject of salary contract negotiations before the task was completed should be denied.Sanchez v. Board of Regents, 1971-NMSC-065, 82 N.M. 672, 486 P.2d 608.\n\nMeaning of \"as otherwise provided by law\".— The exception in Subsection F of this section incorporates an administrative regulation that effectuates the legislature's intent in enacting the Public Employee Bargaining Act [now repealed]; any benefit to the public from inspecting the representation petition filed under that act would be significantly outweighed by a public employee's privacy interest.City of Las Cruces v. Public Employee Labor Relations Bd., 1996-NMSC-024, 121 N.M. 688, 917 P.2d 451.\n\nEnabling statute alone was insufficient to grant authority to declare public records exempt from disclosure.— Where plaintiff sought to enforce an inspection of public records request to the New Mexico corrections department (NMCD) seeking any and all records related to NMCD's use of force and its use of force policy, and where the NMCD asserted that the documents were exempt based on the \"as otherwise provided by law\" exemption set forth in 14-2-1(L) NMSA 1978, because NMCD's enabling statute permitted it to protect inmates by designating documents as confidential and that such a designation was sufficient to exempt the requested documents from production, and where the district court partially granted and partially denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, concluding that limited portions of the disputed records could properly be withheld, but that the remaining portions of the use of force policy and grievance reports were to be disclosed, the district court erred in determining that certain parts of the use of force policy and internal grievance reports could be withheld on the grounds that they were shown to be necessary for the administration of the corrections department, because a general enabling statute alone is insufficient to grant authority to declare public records exempt from disclosure of IPRA requirements. To exempt public records from disclosure pursuant to 14-2-1(L) NMSA 1978, there must be specific authorizing statutes that relate to the effects of disclosure and the confidentiality of the information.Am. Civ. Liberties Union of N.M. v. N.M. Corr. Dep't., 2024-NMCA-071, cert. granted.\n\nException to public policy.— The legislature, in enacting 14-3-15.1 C NMSA 1978, intended to permit state agencies to specifically limit public use of a certain type of record, thereby creating an exception to the general public policy underlying the Inspection of Public Records Act.Crutchfield v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2005-NMCA-022, 137 N.M. 26, 106 P.3d 1273.\n\nJury lists.— A jury list is a public record and the media are entitled to inspect and publish it.State ex rel. N.M. Press Ass'n v. Kaufman, 1982-NMSC-060, 98 N.M. 261, 648 P.2d 300.\n\nCommon-law concept.— The right of the public to inspect records which are in custody of a public officer is a common-law concept and exists even without statute. 1954 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 54-5933.\n\nPublic's right to inspection is not absolute.1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-89.\n\nDissemination of information not necessarily included.— The right to inspect public records does not necessarily include the right to disseminate the information contained in those records. 1969 Op.

However, information in other records which identifies a person accused but not charged with or arrested for a crime may be protected from public disclosure under this section. Finally, even if it would otherwise be protected under either statute, information about a person accused but not charged with a crime is open to public inspection if it is contained in a document listed in 29-10-7 NMSA 1978. 1994 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 94-02.\n\nIdentity of individuals arrested or charged with crime not protected.— Neither the Arrest Record Information Act [27-10-1 NMSA 1978] nor the Inspection of Public Records Act [14-2-4 NMSA 1978] authorizes a law enforcement agency to protect the identity of persons who have been arrested or charged with a crime. 1994 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 94-02.\n\nNo defense to invasion of privacy action.— The right of inspection is no defense to an action for invasion of privacy based upon publication of matters which an individual has the right to keep private. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-89.\n\nCriterion for determining what information is public recordis whether the information is required by law to be kept or is necessarily kept in the discharge of a duty imposed by law. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-89.\n\nProvisions of section contemplate some exceptionto the Public Records Act, 14-3-1 NMSA 1978 et seq. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-19.\n\nCourt opinions subject to inspection or copying.— The supreme court and the court of appeals are required to make available their current and past opinions to the public for inspection or for copying. 1979 Op.

Att'y Gen. No. 60-155.\n\nData compiled from case histories.— Case histories furnished by attending physicians on individual patients from which mortality data is to be taken are confidential records, but the data compiled from such case histories where the individual identity is lost are not confidential. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-158.\n\nWorkers' compensation claim files.— The workers' compensation division maintains workers' compensation claim files in the course of its statutory function of adjudicating claims filed by workers, which makes them public records within the meaning of state freedom of information laws. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. 88-16.\n\nMedical records introduced into evidence.— To the extent any medical records that otherwise are exempt from disclosure are introduced into evidence during the course of a formal workers' compensation hearing which is open to the public, such records lose their exempt status and may be inspected by the public. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-16.\n\nRecords of state penitentiaryare public records and should be made available for public inspection in accordance with the provisions of this section. 1951 Op. Att'y Gen.

Att'y Gen. No. 61-137.\n\nPublic school records.— Any citizen of this state has a right to examine the public records of a school district when such records have been made a part of central records of such school district. This right to inspection is spelled out by statute, and the legislature has specified that the denial of such right of access is punishable as a misdemeanor. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-137.\n\nInstructional material used in public school.— Local school boards have no authority to prohibit citizens of the state from inspecting instructional material used in a public school within the district. 1988 Op.

Att'y Gen. No. 68-110.\n\nSalary information pertaining to state employeewhich is possessed by the state personnel office is a matter of public record, since the state personnel director is required by law to establish and maintain a roster for all state employees showing the employee's pay rate, 10-9-12 NMSA 1978. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-110.\n\nJob applicant's test score and position on eligibility listunder 10-9-13 NMSA 1978, possessed by the state personnel office, is a public record. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-110.\n\nMinutes of board of bar examinersmeet the requirements of the definition of public records, and, as such, are required under the common law adopted by this state and also by this section, as amended, to be public records and, as such, are subject to the inspection of the public. 1954 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 54-5933.\n\nInterstate stream commission.— Under the provisions of this section, any public records reflecting the work or action of the interstate stream commission are subject to public inspection. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-80.\n\nCounty fair board.— Since the legislature has specifically granted counties the authority to conduct county fairs, a county fair board is an arm of the county and its records are county records which are subject to inspection as provided in this section and former 14-2-2 NMSA 1978. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-109.\n\nData of personal nature used in educating pupils not subject.— Such records or memoranda as may be kept by a teacher, or other school official, for informational purposes on individual students, and which may contain data of a personal nature for use in assisting teachers or school personnel in educating pupils, do not fall within the classification of public records entitled to be scrutinized by the public. 1961 Op.

This right, however, should be narrowly and restrictively applied. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-110.\n\nPersonnel file.— Under the rule-making authority of 10-9-10 and 10-9-13 NMSA 1978, the state personnel board has a limited and restricted right to classify as confidential certain portions of an individual's personnel file which would not otherwise be made available to the state unless on a confidential or restricted basis. 1964 Op.

Toomey v. City of Truth or Consequences, 2012-NMCA-104, 287 P.3d 364.\n\nFactors to determine whether a private entity is subject to the Inspection of Public Records Act.— Courts should consider the following factors in deciding whether private entities are subject to the Inspection of Public Records Act: (1) the level of public funding; (2) commingling of funds; (3) whether the activity was conducted on publicly owned property; (4) whether the services contracted for are an integral part of the agency's chosen decision-making process; (5) whether the private entity is performing a governmental function or a function which the public agency otherwise would perform; (6) the extent of the public agency's involvement with, regulation of, or control over the private entity; (7) whether the private entity was created by the public agency; (8) whether the public agency has a substantial financial interest in the private entity; and (9) for whose benefit the private entity is functioning.State ex rel. Toomey v. City of Truth or Consequences, 2012-NMCA-104, 287 P.3d 364.\n\nA private entity was subject to the Inspection of Public Records Act.— Where the municipality acquired a public access channel and adopted an ordinance that required the municipality to be responsible for management of the access channel and to adopt rules, regulations and procedures for the use of the access channel; the municipality contracted with a private entity to operate the access channel; the operation agreement required the private entity to operate the access channel in a manner that was consistent with the ordinance; the municipality funded the private entity with an annual grant that was released to the private entity when it gave the municipality an annual activity plan and budget; the private entity was required to account for how the funds were spent; for a nominal rent, the municipality leased the basement of the municipal civic center to the private entity to use as the public access television center; the municipality had the right to terminate the operating agreement without cause; the operating agreement identified the private entity as an independent contractor and stated that no principal or agent relationship existed between the municipality and the private entity; and the municipality denied plaintiff's request for recordings of city commission meetings that the private entity had recorded and played on the access channel, the private entity was acting on behalf of the municipality in its role as the access channel operational organization, and the recordings of city commission meetings made by the private entity were public records subject to inspection.State ex rel. Toomey v. City of Truth or Consequences, 2012-NMCA-104, 287 P.3d 364.\n\nSettlement agreement documents were public records.— Where respondent, a private prison medical services provider that provided contracted healthcare services for the New Mexico corrections department (NMCD), negotiated and settled at least fifty-nine civil claims alleging instances of improper care and/or sexual assault of inmates, and where petitioners submitted written requests pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act seeking all settlement documents involving respondent in its role as medical services contractor for NMCD, the district court did not err in issuing a writ of mandamus ordering respondent to produce the settlement agreements and pay petitioners' reasonable attorney fees, because the settlement agreements were created as a result of respondent's public function acting on behalf of NMCD. Third-party settlement agreements resulting from medical care provided under a contract with the state are public documents subject to disclosure.N.M. Found. for Open Gov't v. Corizon Health, 2020-NMCA-014, cert. denied.\n\nDefinition of \"public records\" in Public Records Act (14-3-1 to 14-3-16 NMSA 1978) does not apply to section,the Inspection of Public Records Act.State ex rel. Newsome v. Alarid, 1977-NMSC-076, 90 N.M. 790, 568 P.2d 1236.\n\n\"Relate to public business\" construed.— Where plaintiff submitted an IPRA request to the New Mexico department of game and fish (NMDGF) seeking the names and email address given by all applicants for hunting licenses in 2015 and 2016, which NMDGF determined amounted to over 300,000 entries, and where NMDGF concluded that plaintiff's request sought personal identifier information that did not constitute a public record subject to disclosure and agreed to produce only the applicants' names, the district court did not err in granting plaintiff's motion for summary judgment because IPRA's definition of \"relating to public business\" means that the requested records are connected to governmental affairs or official actions by or on behalf of public bodies, and therefore the email addresses NMDGF collected in connection with its licensing system constitute public records that are subject to disclosure. Dunn v. N.M. Dep't of Game & Fish, 2020-NMCA-026.\n\nFaculty salary mattersare not public records until the culmination of the contract between the board and the individual; thought processes, or the offer of a contract, are not such a public record as would require public inspection, so that the right to inspect records of the board of regents of a state university on the subject of salary contract negotiations before the task was completed should be denied.Sanchez v. Board of Regents, 1971-NMSC-065, 82 N.M. 672, 486 P.2d 608.\n\nTerm \"public records\"is intended to include all papers or memoranda in the possession of public officers which are required by law to be kept by them. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-131.\n\nPublic records.— Elements essential to constitute a public record are that it be made by a public officer and that the officer be authorized by law to make it. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-55.\n\nA state agency is a \"person\", for purposes of IPRA, and may request public records from other state agencies.— Where the state ethics commission (commission) sent a public records request, pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA), NMSA 1978, §§ 14-2-1 to -12, to the New Mexico human services department [health care authority department] (department), asking the department to provide copies of certain emails from several named employees, and where the department denied the request claiming that the commission, itself a \"public body\" for the purposes of IPRA, is not a \"person\" entitled to make public records requests, the department erred in denying the commission's public records request, because a public body is an \"entity,\" within the definition of \"person,\" § 14-2-6(D), and therefore the plain language of IPRA demonstrates that public bodies can submit public records requests to other public bodies.

An offer to an incarcerated person of an opportunity to visit a location outside the place of incarceration during business hours is not reasonable under the circumstances and does not align with the legislature's clearly asserted public police that to provide persons with such information is an essential function of a representative government and an integral part of the routine duties of public officers and employees.Franklin v.

Nothing in this section regarding the provision of public data in electronic format shall limit the ability of the custodian to engage in the sale of data as authorized by Sections 14-3-15.1 and 14-3-18 NMSA 1978, including imposing reasonable restrictions on the use of the database and the payment of a royalty or other consideration.\n\nHistory:Laws 1993, ch. 258, § 6; 2011, ch. 181, § 2; 2011, ch. 182, § 3; 2013, ch. 117, § 2.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective April 2, 2013, expanded the authority to sell data; and in Subsection D, after \"Sections 14-3-15.1\", added \"and 14-3-18\".\n\nThe 2011 amendment,effective June 17, 2011.added the last sentence in Subsection A; added Subsection B and relettered the succeeding subsection; in Subsection C, added Subparagraphs (3) and (4), and renumbered the succeeding subparagraphs; and added a new Subsection D.\n\nRight subject to reasonable restrictions and conditions.— The right to inspect public records commonly carries with it the right to make copies thereof, subject, however, to reasonable restrictions and conditions imposed as to their use, reasonable regulations as to appropriate times when and places where they may be inspected and copied and such reasonable supervision by the custodian thereof as may be necessary for their safety and as will secure equal opportunity for all to inspect and copy them.Ortiz v. Jaramillo, 1971-NMSC-041, 82 N.M. 445, 483 P.2d 500.\n\nException for letters and memoranda apply to entire document.— Where plaintiff filed a complaint in district court seeking a writ of mandamus or a court order compelling the livestock board (board) to disclose an investigative report produced by an outside firm retained by the board to investigate allegations that a particular board inspector had committed timesheet fraud by billing the board for his time while working at a second job, and where plaintiff claimed that the board's custodian of records was required to separate \"matters of fact\" from \"matters of opinion\" in the report and produce the matters of fact for inspection, the district court did not err in granting the board's motion for summary judgment, because the plain language of the exemption in NMSA 1978, 14-2-1(C) applies to letters or memoranda that are matters of opinion in personnel files in their entirety, and NMSA 1978, 14-2-9(A), by its plain language, does not require a custodian of records to separate exempt from nonexempt information when an exemption applies to a document as a whole, which § 14-2-1(C) does.Henry v. Gauman, 2023-NMCA-078, cert. denied.\n\nRecording Act governs real property records request.— Where plaintiff corporation sought all of Lea county's real property image and index records, the production provisions of the Recording Act, 14-8-1 through 14-8-17 NMSA 1978, rather than those of the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA), 14-2-1 through 14-2-12 NMSA 1978, governed the county's obligation in responding to plaintiff's records request, because IPRA creates a records inspection scheme of general application granting, with various exceptions, a right to inspect public records of this state, and the Recording Act more specifically provides a mechanism by which prospective purchasers can examine real property records, and places on county clerks associated duties to make these records available and searchable for the public.TexasFile LLC v. Board of Cty. Comm'rs of Lea Cty., 2019-NMCA-038, cert. denied.\n\nThere is not a blanket exception from inspection for law enforcement records relating to an ongoing criminal investigation.— Where plaintiff sent a written request to the department of public safety (DPS) pursuant to IPRA for various records relating to the shooting death of his brother, and where DPS produced a primary incident report, the personnel records of one of the officers involved, and one subpoena, but denied production of all other pertinent records in its possession, claiming that the release of the requested information posed a demonstrable and serious threat to an ongoing criminal investigation and that the FBI asked DPS to withhold the records in order to maintain the integrity of its investigation, the district court erred in denying plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and in granting DPS's motion for summary judgment, because § 14-2-1 NMSA 1978 does not create a blanket exception from inspection of law enforcement records relating to an ongoing criminal investigation, and DPS did not present evidence that any specific records that it refused to produce revealed confidential sources, methods, information or individuals accused but not charged with a crime, nor did DPS present any evidence that it reviewed the requested records to separate the exempt from nonexempt information, or that it provided any nonexempt information existing within records containing exempt information.Jones v. N.M. Dep't of Public Safety, 2020-NMSC-013,rev'gNo. A-1-CA-35120, mem. op. (May 10, 2018) (non-precedential).\n\nRight to make copies.— The right to inspect or examine public records commonly includes the right of making copies thereof as the right to inspect would be valueless without this correlative right. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-170.\n\nIt is permissible for an individual or a company such as an abstractor to photocopy voter registrations in the offices of the county clerks so long as adequate precautions are taken to ensure the integrity of the records and to preserve their availability for inspection by others. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-170.\n\nCharges not to be imposed.— A charge of $25.00 per month may not be imposed by counties upon abstract and title companies for such facilities as lights, telephone and janitorial services to reimburse the counties therefor in connection with abstract and title companies inspecting and copying public records, because this practice amounts to a denial of the right to inspect records. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-102.\n\nPublic's right to inspection is not absolute.1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-89.\n\nCourt opinions subject to inspection or copying.— The supreme court and the court of appeals are required to make available their current and past opinions to the public for inspection or for copying. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-14.\n\nReimbursement or other consideration to courts for copying costs.— The supreme court and the court of appeals should require reasonable reimbursement for the costs incurred by them for copying opinions for the public or for retrieving their opinions for inspection. However, such a charge need not be made in those cases in which the courts receive some other form of consideration in return for supplying their opinions to private individuals or enterprises. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-14.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 37A Am.

The public entity must designate the sealed records for review by the court.Board of Comm'rs v. Las Cruces Sun-News, 2003-NMCA-102, 134 N.M. 283, 76 P.3d 36.\n\nCounty not permitted to circumvent established procedure of in camera review.— Where a county sought to circumvent the procedure outlined inState ex rel. Newsome v. Alarid, 1977-NMSC-076, 90 N.M. 790, 568 P.2d 1236, for in camera review of disputed documents by filing a motion for a protective order and asserting to the district court that it could only consider the settlement records if the motion for protective order was granted, the county's decision to bypass established procedure effectively obstructed full review by the district court and the court of appeals and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for protective order.Board of Comm'rs v. Las Cruces Sun-News, 2003-NMCA-102, 134 N.M. 283, 76 P.3d 36.\n\nThe threshold requirements for an in camera inspectionare that the custodian of the records must first determine whether the person requesting disclosure is a citizen and whether the request is for a lawful purpose; second, the custodian must justify why the records should not be furnished.State ex rel. Blanchard v. City Comm'rs, 1988-NMCA-008, 106 N.M. 769, 750 P.2d 469.\n\nJustification for refusing to release records.— Fact that information was obtained under a promise of confidentiality, standing alone, would not suffice to preclude disclosure. The promise would have to coincide with reasonable justification, based on public policy, for refusing to release the records. Furthermore, the justification would have to be articulated by the custodian for the record.State ex rel. Newsome v. Alarid, 1977-NMSC-076, 90 N.M. 790, 568 P.2d 1236.\n\nDuty of custodian to determine whether information can be justifiably withheld.— There may be circumstances under which the information contained in the record can be justifiably withheld. The custodian has the initial duty to make this determination as to each record requested. He must first determine that the person requesting access is a citizen and that he is requesting the information for a lawful purpose. The burden is upon the custodian to justify why the records sought to be examined should not be furnished. It shall then be the court's duty to determine whether the explanation of the custodian is reasonable and to weigh the benefits to be derived from nondisclosure against the harm which may result if the records are not made available.State ex rel. Newsome v. Alarid, 1977-NMSC-076, 90 N.M. 790, 568 P.2d 1236.\n\nDenial of request to review applications for position of city manager.— A municipality's denial of a request to inspect applications received by the municipality for the position of city manager on the grounds that disclosure of the applications would deter potential applicants and reduce the quality and scope of the applicant pool was insufficient, under the rule of reason, to outweigh the public's interest in disclosure.City of Farmington v. The Daily Times, 2009-NMCA-057, 146 N.M. 349, 210 P.3d 246.\n\nThe Inspection of Public Records Act provides for two separate remedies.— This section and 14-2-12 NMSA 1978 create separate remedies depending on the stage of the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) request. This section requires a public entity to respond to a records request within fifteen days unless the request has been determined to be excessively burdensome or broad. If the request is denied, the custodian shall provide the requester with a written explanation of the denial. It is when the custodian fails to respond to a request or deliver a written explanation of the denial that the public entity is subject to damages pursuant to this section. The enforcement and damages provisions of 14-2-12 NMSA 1978 apply in an action for the post-denial enforcement of the IPRA request.Faber v. King, 2015-NMSC-015,rev'g2013-NMCA-080, 306 P.3d 519.\n\nWhere the attorney general's office received a request for public records pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) and denied the request the next day, damages pursuant to this section were not applicable because the attorney general's office timely answered the request with a denial by following the denial procedures set out in this section. When the district court held that the attorney general's office wrongfully withheld the public records, the enforcement and damages provisions of 14-2-12(D) NMSA 1978 applied.Faber v. King, 2015-NMSC-015,rev'g2013-NMCA-080, 306 P.3d 519.\n\nSeparate remedies distinguished.— Section 14-2-11 NMSA 1978 is focused on deterring nonresponsiveness and noncompliance by public bodies in the first instance, while 14-2-12 NMSA 1978 is focused on making whole a person who, believing his or her right of inspection has been impermissibly denied, brings a successful enforcement action.Britton v. Office of the Att'y Gen., 2019-NMCA-002.\n\nIncomplete or inadequate responses to IPRA requests.— Where plaintiff made a request for documents from the Attorney General's Office (AGO) pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act, §§ 14-2-1 to -12 NMSA 1978, and where the AGO incompletely and inadequately responded to the request, the district court erred in concluding that plaintiff's action is exclusively one that proceeds under 14-2-12 NMSA 1978 and limiting the damages plaintiff can recover to actual damages under Subsection D of that provision, because a public body that permits only partial inspection, that is inspection of some but not all nonexempt responsive records, has not complied with its obligation to provide the greatest possible information regarding the affairs of government.Britton v. Office of the Att'y Gen., 2019-NMCA-002.\n\nRemedy for inadequate response to IPRA request.— Where plaintiff made a request for documents from the Attorney General's Office (AGO) pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act, §§ 14-2-1 to -12 NMSA 1978, and where the AGO failed to permit inspection of approximately 350 records that were responsive to plaintiff's request and for which no claim of exemption was ever asserted or written explanation of denial issued, the district court erred in concluding that plaintiff's action is exclusively one that proceeds under 14-2-12 NMSA 1978 and limiting the damages plaintiff can recover to actual damages under Subsection D of that provision, because the AGO's failure to either produce for inspection or deliver or mail a written explanation of denial regarding the 350 documents is the type of wrong that 14-2-11 NMSA 1978's statutory penalty seeks to remedy.Britton v. Office of the Att'y Gen., 2019-NMCA-002.\n\nPleading an action for enforcement of IPRA against a private entity.— To plead an action for enforcement of the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA), 14-2-1 to 14-2-12 NMSA 1978, against a private entity, a plaintiff must simply allege that the records sought are public records arising out of the private entity's performance of a public function and that the private entity has failed to comply with IPRA via the manner outlined in either 14-2-11(C) NMSA 1978 or 14-2-12(D) NMSA 1978.Franklin v. Keefe Commissary Network, 2024-NMCA-070.\n\nRecords arising out of a private entity's performance of a public function and on behalf of a public entity are subject to IPRA.— Where plaintiff, a state inmate, requested records regarding commissary prices for state prisoners, pursuant to the New Mexico Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA), 14-2-1 to 14-2-12 NMSA 1978, from defendant, a private corporation contracting with the New Mexico corrections department (NMCD) to operate an inmate commissary program at New Mexico state facilities, based on plaintiff's belief that prices were not set at fair market value, and where, upon receiving no response from defendant, plaintiff filed a complaint to enforce IPRA, and where defendant filed a pretrial motion to dismiss, arguing that defendant was not subject to IPRA because it is a private entity, the district court erred in granting defendant's motion to dismiss, because the records sought were public records arising out of defendant's performance of a public function and on behalf of a public entity. Plaintiff established under the facts of the complaint that defendant may be subject to IPRA.Franklin v. Keefe Commissary Network, 2024-NMCA-070.\n\nThe Electronic Communications Privacy Act is not an exception to disclosure of public records.— Where the state ethics commission (commission) sent a public records request to the New Mexico human services department [health care authority department] (department), asking the department to provide copies of certain emails from several named employees, and where the department denied the request claiming that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), NMSA 1978, § 10-16F-1 to -6, operates as an exception to disclosure through the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA), NMSA 1978, §§ 14-2-1 to -12, because the commission may obtain the requested records through a subpoena, the department erred in denying the commission's public records request, because the commission's ability to obtain pubic records through a subpoena does not mean that it is unable to seek the same records through IPRA, and nothing in the ECPA's text suggests that the legislature intended the statute to operate as an exception to disclosure through IPRA.Public Records Requests Made by the State Ethics Comm'n(10/27/21), Att'y Gen.

Farer, 1985-NMSC-096, 103 N.M. 415, 708 P.2d 327.\n\nProtective order precludes disclosure of records.— Where plaintiff was a petitioner in a domestic relations matter in district court that involved his ten-year-old child, and where, on plaintiff's motion, the district court appointed defendant as guardian ad litem to the child, and where plaintiff served defendant with a discovery request seeking all correspondence received or produced with either party or any other person in relation to the domestic relations case, and where the district court issued a protective order stating that defendant was not required to respond to plaintiff's request for production, prompting plaintiff to request from defendant and the designated custodian of records in the district court, pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act, 14-2-1 to -12 NMSA 1978, to produce all records of communications sent or received in any form in the domestic relations case, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of defendant, because the protective order barred disclosure of the requested records to plaintiff, and persons subject to an injunctive order issued by a court with jurisdiction are expected to obey that decree until it is modified or reversed, even if they have proper grounds to object to the order.Dunn v. Brandt, 2019-NMCA-061.\n\nSuccessful action to enforce is prerequisite for damages.— It is only in the event that a court action is brought to enforce the Inspection of Public Records Act that a plaintiff may be awarded mandatory costs, fees, and damages, and then only if the plaintiff is successful in that action.Derringer v. State, 2003-NMCA-073, 133 N.M. 721, 68 P.3d 961, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 727, 69 P.3d 237.\n\nSuccessful litigation interpreted.— Where the secretary of state's office did not fully comply with an inspection of public records request, claiming that its late production of records to plaintiff cannot constitute success under the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) because plaintiff already had possession of the records at the time the litigation was filed, and as a result, the secretary of state's office did not withhold or deny plaintiff access to the records, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney's fees because IPRA does not include prior possession as a legitimate ground for withholding public documents, and the fact that plaintiff's litigation secured the production of the denied responsive public records, the litigation was \"successful\" as that word is used in IPRA.ACLU of New Mexico v. Duran, 2016-NMCA-063.\n\nReasonable attorney's fees.— Where the secretary of state's office did not fully comply with an inspection of public records request, claiming that its late production of records to plaintiff cannot constitute success under the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) because plaintiff already had possession of the records at the time the litigation was filed, and as a result, did not withhold or deny plaintiff access to the records, the district court's award of attorney's fees was not an abuse of discretion because fees incurred in obtaining documents from a state agency are prima facie reasonable, and when withheld records are subsequently revealed and determined to be responsive, those records may become the basis for an award of attorney's fees in IPRA litigation.ACLU of New Mexico v. Duran, 2016-NMCA-063.\n\nNo action for damages after compliance.— The Inspection of Public Records Act does not provide for damages pursuant to an action brought after a public body has complied with the act.Derringer v.

Las Cruces Sun-News, 2003-NMCA-102, 134 N.M. 283, 76 P.3d 36.\n\nThe Inspection of Public Records Act provides for two separate remedies.— Section 14-2-11 NMSA 1978 and this section create separate remedies depending on the stage of the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) request. Section 14-2-11 NMSA 1978 requires a public entity to respond to a records request within fifteen days unless the request has been determined to be excessively burdensome or broad. If the request is denied, the custodian shall provide the requester with a written explanation of the denial. It is when the custodian fails to respond to a request or deliver a written explanation of the denial that the public entity is subject to damages pursuant to 14-2-11 NMSA 1978. The enforcement and damages provisions of this section apply in an action for the post-denial enforcement of the IPRA request.Faber v. King, 2015-NMSC-015,rev'g2013-NMCA-080, 306 P.3d 519.\n\nWhere the attorney general's office received a request for public records pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) and denied the request the next day, damages pursuant to 14-2-11 NMSA 1978 were not applicable because the attorney general's office timely answered the request with a denial by following the denial procedures set out in 14-2-11 NMSA 1978. When the district court held that the attorney general's office wrongfully withheld the public records, the enforcement and damages provisions of this section applied.Faber v. King, 2015-NMSC-015,rev'g2013-NMCA-080, 306 P.3d 519.\n\nMandamus is an appropriate remedy to enforce IPRA requests.— Where respondent, a private prison medical services provider that provided contracted healthcare services for the New Mexico corrections department (NMCD), negotiated and settled at least fifty-nine civil claims alleging instances of improper care and/or sexual assault of inmates, and where petitioners submitted written requests pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) seeking all settlement documents involving respondent in its role as medical services contractor for NMCD, and where the district court issued a writ of mandamus ordering respondent to produce the settlement agreements, mandamus was a proper remedy to require respondent to produce public records pursuant to IPRA because petitioners had a clear legal right of enforcement and respondent had a clear legal duty to provide public records.N.M. Found. for Open Gov't v. Corizon Health, 2020-NMCA-014, cert. denied.\n\nAward of attorney fees was supported by substantial evidence.— Where respondent, a private prison medical services provider that provided contracted healthcare services for the New Mexico corrections department (NMCD), negotiated and settled at least fifty-nine civil claims alleging instances of improper care and/or sexual assault of inmates, and where petitioners submitted written requests pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) seeking all settlement documents involving respondent in its role as medical services contractor for NMCD, and where the district court issued a writ of mandamus ordering respondent to produce the settlement agreements and pay petitioners' reasonable attorney fees, the district court's attorney fee award was supported by substantial evidence where the court considered the attorneys' years of experience and record of fee awards as well as an expert witness's testimony explaining market rates in the relevant jurisdiction.N.M. Found. for Open Gov't v. Corizon Health, 2020-NMCA-014, cert. denied.\n\nSeparate remedies distinguished.— Section 14-2-11 NMSA 1978 is focused on deterring nonresponsiveness and noncompliance by public bodies in the first instance, while 14-2-12 NMSA 1978 is focused on making whole a person who, believing his or her right of inspection has been impermissibly denied, brings a successful enforcement action.Britton v. Office of the Att'y Gen., 2019-NMCA-002.\n\nIncomplete or inadequate responses to IPRA requests.— Where plaintiff made a request for documents from the Attorney General's Office (AGO) pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act, §§ 14-2-1 to -12 NMSA 1978, and where the AGO incompletely and inadequately responded to the request, the district court erred in concluding that plaintiff's action is exclusively one that proceeds under 14-2-12 NMSA 1978 and limiting the damages plaintiff can recover to actual damages under Subsection D of that provision, because a public body that permits only partial inspection, that is inspection of some but not all nonexempt responsive records, has not complied with its obligation to provide the greatest possible information regarding the affairs of government.Britton v. Office of the Att'y Gen., 2019-NMCA-002.\n\nRemedy for inadequate response to IPRA request.— Where plaintiff made a request for documents from the Attorney General's Office (AGO) pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act, §§ 14-2-1 to -12 NMSA 1978, and where the AGO failed to permit inspection of approximately 350 records that were responsive to plaintiff's request and for which no claim of exemption was ever asserted or written explanation of denial issued, the district court erred in concluding that plaintiff's action is exclusively one that proceeds under 14-2-12 NMSA 1978 and limiting the damages plaintiff can recover to actual damages under Subsection D of that provision, because the AGO's failure to either produce for inspection or deliver or mail a written explanation of denial regarding the 350 documents is the type of wrong that 14-2-11 NMSA 1978's statutory penalty seeks to remedy.Britton v. Office of the Att'y Gen., 2019-NMCA-002.\n\nPleading an action for enforcement of IPRA against a private entity.— To plead an action for enforcement of the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA), 14-2-1 to 14-2-12 NMSA 1978, against a private entity, a plaintiff must simply allege that the records sought are public records arising out of the private entity's performance of a public function and that the private entity has failed to comply with IPRA via the manner outlined in either 14-2-11(C) NMSA 1978 or 14-2-12(D) NMSA 1978.Franklin v. Keefe Commissary Network, 2024-NMCA-070.\n\nRecords arising out of a private entity's performance of a public function and on behalf of a public entity are subject to IPRA.— Where plaintiff, a state inmate, requested records regarding commissary prices for state prisoners, pursuant to the New Mexico Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA), 14-2-1 to 14-2-12 NMSA 1978, from defendant, a private corporation contracting with the New Mexico corrections department (NMCD) to operate an inmate commissary program at New Mexico state facilities, based on plaintiff's belief that prices were not set at fair market value, and where, upon receiving no response from defendant, plaintiff filed a complaint to enforce IPRA, and where defendant filed a pretrial motion to dismiss, arguing that defendant was not subject to IPRA because it is a private entity, the district court erred in granting defendant's motion to dismiss, because the records sought were public records arising out of defendant's performance of a public function and on behalf of a public entity. Plaintiff established under the facts of the complaint that defendant may be subject to IPRA.Franklin v. Keefe Commissary Network, 2024-NMCA-070.\n\nFindings as to damages.— If the district court awards damages under Section 14-2-12(D) NMSA 1978 for enforcement of a denied request to inspect records, the district court is required to enter findings specifying the nature and measure of the damages.Faber v. King, 2013-NMCA-080, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-007.\n\nWhere plaintiff represented employees of defendant in an employment dispute in federal court; the federal court ordered a stay of discovery; plaintiff filed a request for inspection of employment records from defendant's office; defendant denied the request; the district court held that the discovery stay did not preempt rights granted by the Inspection of Public Records Act and ruled that defendant had violated the act; the district court awarded damages of $10 per day from the date of the wrongful denial to the date the federal court lifted the stay and thereafter damages of $100 per day until the records were provided; and although the district court did not specify the nature and purpose of the damage award, the record indicated that the damages were punitive, the award was unsupported by findings supporting compensatory damages, which are a prerequisite to punitive damages.Faber v. King, 2013-NMCA-080, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-007.\n\nAttorney's fees.— Where plaintiff's made two requests for records of payments the school district made to a former employee; the school district denied both requests; the district court ordered the school district to produce the records; to support plaintiffs' request for attorneys' fees in the amount of $22,899, plaintiffs proffered their attorneys' itemized billing statements and resumes together with the affidavit of an attorney familiar with the prevailing rates charged by attorneys who attested to the reasonableness of the fees charged and the competency of plaintiffs' attorneys; the district court awarded plaintiffs an arbitrary fee of $5,000 on the grounds that plaintiffs' attorneys charged \"strikingly high hourly rates\", plaintiff filed only four pleadings, and there were no hearings; the court refused to review the billing statements, rejected the affidavit, and relied on its own assessment of a reasonable hourly rate and a reasonable amount of time to litigate the case; the court did not have a clear grasp of the time and labor involved in litigating the case to a successful conclusion or consider the novelty of the issues addressed in plaintiffs' pleadings or the policy goals of the Inspection of Public Records Act; and the court failed to utilize an objective basis for determining a reasonable award of attorney fees, the court abused its discretion.Rio Grande Sun v. Jemez Mountains Pub. Sch. Dist., 2012-NMCA-091, 287 P.3d 318, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-008.\n\nIt is clear the Legislature intended to enforce disclosure by imposing a cost including attorney fees for nondisclosure within the time frames set by the Inspection of Public Records Act, regardless of whether the public entity characterizes the nondisclosure as a \"denial\" or as an indefinite \"delay\".Board of Comm'rs v. Las Cruces Sun-News, 2003-NMCA-102, 134 N.M. 283, 76 P.3d 36.\n\nRemedy for denial of access to tax assessment records.— Taxpayers who believed that assessor wrongfully denied them access to public records should have pursued the remedies provided in this section. To the extent the board found that the information sought was irrelevant to the assessment of taxpayers' property, there was no error in the board's refusal to sanction assessor.Hannahs v. Anderson, 1998-NMCA-152, 126 N.M. 1, 966 P.2d 168, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 532, 972 P.2d 351.\n\nThis section does not authorize punitive damages.— Although government liability for punitive damages would deter the abuse of governmental power and promote accountability among government officials, the countervailing policy of protecting public revenues must prevail unless punitive damages are specifically authorized by statute. This section does not specifically authorize punitive damages.Faber v. King, 2015-NMSC-015,rev'g2013-NMCA-080, 306 P.3d 519.\n\nThis section authorizes the recovery of compensatory damages.— The damages provisions contained in the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) are designed to promote compliance and accountability from New Mexico's public servants. This section ensures that IPRA requests are not wrongfully denied, and if the requester is not made whole by the provision of the documents, the legislature authorized a successful litigant, in an action to enforce a wrongfully denied IPRA request, to seek compensatory or actual damages, costs, and attorneys' fees.Faber v. King, 2015-NMSC-015,rev'g2013-NMCA-080, 306 P.3d 519.\n\nWhere plaintiff was successful in his state court action against the attorney general's office to enforce the provisions of the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA), and the state district court issued a writ of mandamus ordering the attorney general's office to comply with the request for public records, and further awarded per diem damages and costs to plaintiff, but failed to clarify the nature of the damages, the supreme court held that this section does not authorize punitive damages or per diem damages for the post-denial enforcement of an IPRA request. In a court action to enforce the provisions of IPRA, this section authorizes costs, reasonable attorneys' fees and compensatory or actual damages only.Faber v. King, 2015-NMSC-015,rev'g2013-NMCA-080, 306 P.3d 519.\n\nDamages.— Damages for enforcement of a denied request to inspect records are governed by 14-2-12(D) NMSA 1978, not 14-2-11(C) NMSA 1978. The statutory maximum per-day penalty of 14-2-11(C) NMSA 1978 does not create any standard for an amount of damages under 14-2-12(D) NMSA 1978.Faber v. King, 2013-NMCA-080, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-007.",
