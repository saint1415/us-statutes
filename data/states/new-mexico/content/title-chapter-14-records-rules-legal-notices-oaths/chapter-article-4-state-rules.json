An order or decision or other document issued or promulgated in connection with the disposition of any case or agency decision upon a particular matter as applied to a specific set of facts shall not be deemed such a rule, nor shall it constitute specific adoption thereof by the agency. \"Rule\" does not include rules relating to the management, confinement, discipline or release of inmates of any penal or charitable institution, the New Mexico boys' school, the girls' welfare home or any hospital; rules made relating to the management of any particular educational institution, whether elementary or otherwise; or rules made relating to admissions, discipline, supervision, expulsion or graduation of students from any educational institution; and\n\nG. \"rulemaking\" means the process for adoption of a new rule or the amendment, readoption or repeal of an existing rule.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 71-7-2, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 275, § 2; 1969, ch. 92, § 1; 2017, ch. 137, § 1.\n\nThe 2017 amendment,effective July 1, 2017, defined \"proceeding\", \"proposed rule\", \"provide to the public\", and \"rulemaking\", and revised the definitions of certain terms, as used in the State Rules Act; in Subsection B, after \"business trusts\", added \"political subdivisions\", and deleted \"and\" at the end of the subsection; added new Subsections C through E and redesignated former Subsection C as Subsection F; in Subsection F, after \"regulation\", deleted \"order\" and added \"or\", after \"standard\", deleted \"statement of policy\", after \"including\", added \"those that explicitly or implicitly implement or interpret a federal or state legal mandate or other applicable law and\", after \"repeals\", added \"and renewals\", after \"the issuing agency\", added \", including affecting persons served by the agency\", deleted \"Such term shall\" and added \"'Rule' does\", after \"charitable institution, the\", deleted \"Springer\" and added \"New Mexico\", after \"welfare home\", deleted \"of\" and added \"or\", after \"any hospital\", deleted \"nor to\", after \"elementary or otherwise\", deleted \"nor to\", after the semicolon, added \"or\", and after \"graduation of students\", deleted \"therefrom\" and added \"from any educational institution; and\"; and added Subsection G.\n\nA standard is a rule,if the proper procedure has been followed in promulgating it.Bokum Resources Corp. v. New Mexico Water Quality Control Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-090, 93 N.M. 546, 603 P.2d 285.\n\nPrison rules.— The Legislature could not have made it more clear that rules relating to the management, confinement, discipline or release of inmates are not subject to filing under the State Rules Act since, although the Corrections Department Act requires that all rules be filed in accordance with the State Rules Act, the latter clearly excludes certain rules relating to inmates from its definition of rules, in 14-4-2 NMSA 1978.Johnson v. Francke, 1987-NMCA-029, 105 N.M. 564, 734 P.2d 804.\n\n\"Rules\" and \"standards\".— The terms \"rule\" and \"standard\" include procedural standards, manuals, directives and requirements if they purport to affect one or more agencies besides the issuing agency or persons other than the issuing agencies' members or employees. 1993 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 93-01.\n\nMuseum resolution.— A resolution of the Museum of New Mexico permitting only Indians to sell handicrafts under the portal of the Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe was a rule within the meaning of the State Rules Act.Livingston v. Ewing, 1982-NMSC-110, 98 N.M. 685, 652 P.2d 235;State v. Joyce, 1980-NMCA-086, 94 N.M. 618, 614 P.2d 30.\n\nOrders and decisions excluded by definition from class of rulesto which State Rules Act applies are not subject to the provisions of those sections and, in particular, are not governed by 14-4-3 and 14-4-5 NMSA 1978. 1979 Op.

The state records administrator, after written notification to the filing agency, may make minor, nonsubstantive corrections in spelling, grammar and format in filed rules. The state records administrator shall make a record of the correction and shall deliver the record to the filing agency and issuing authority within ten days of the change. Within thirty days of receiving that state records administrator's record of a correction, the agency shall provide to the public notice of the correction in the same manner as the agency used to give notice of the rulemaking proceeding pursuant to Section 4 of this 2017 act [14-4-5.2 NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 71-7-3, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 275, § 3; 1969, ch. 92, § 2; 1987, ch. 40, § 1; 1995, ch. 110, § 2; 2017, ch. 137, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For records of state agencies and databases under Public Records Act,see14-3-15.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor electronic authentication and substitution for signature,see14-3-15.2 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2017 amendment,effective July 1, 2017, replaced the \"records center\" with the \"state records administrator\" for purposes of receiving promulgated rules, revised the requirements for submitting a rule to the state records administrator, allowed the state records administrator to make minor, non-substantive corrections to submitted rules, and required the agency to give public notice of minor non-substantive corrections made by the state records administrator in the same manner as required for rulemaking; ; added new subsection designation \"A.\"; in Subsection A, after \"required by rule of the\", deleted \"records center\" and added \"state records administrator\", after \"shall deliver\", deleted \"one original paper copy and one electronic copy\" and added \"the rule\", after \"to the\", deleted \"records center\" and added \"state records administrator or the administrator's designee, accompanied by the concise explanatory statement required by the State Rules Act\"; added subsection designation \"B.\"; in Subsection B, after \"shall maintain\", deleted \"the original\" and added \"a\", after \"copy\", added \"of the rule\", after \"office hours,\", deleted \"and shall have the rule\" and added \"on the website of the records center\"; added subsection designation \"C.\"; in Subsection C, after \"may submit to the\", deleted \"records center an additional paper\" and added \"state records administrator or the administrator's designee a\"; and added Subsection D.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, substituted \"deliver one original paper copy and one electronic copy\" for \"cause seven copies to be delivered\" in the first sentence; substituted \"maintain the original copy\" for \"a list of places to file copies\" in the third sentence; added the language at the end of the section beginning \"and shall have\"; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nRecords center may require certificate of compliance.— Pursuant to its authority under this section to adopt a rule governing the style and format of the rules and regulations to be filed, the records center may require a certificate of compliance as a matter of style or format. While the records center has no authority to look behind a certificate of compliance or to make any determination of actual compliance, failure to incorporate such a certificate of compliance on rules and regulations submitted for filing would constitute a failure to comply with the required style and format. 1978 Op.

No. 79-32.\n\nState records administrator does not have the authority to conduct investigations into the compliance of state agencies with respect to their adherence to the requirements of the State Rules Act.— New Mexico courts have consistently held that administrative bodies are creatures of statute and can act only on those matters which are within the scope of authority delegated to them. The State Rules Act, NMSA 1978, §§ 14-4-1 to -11, does not provide the state records administrator the authority to independently investigate the actions of state agencies with respect to their adherence to the notice and hearing requirements of the State Rules Act.Authority of Commission of Public Records and SRCA(11/18/21), Att'y Gen.

An agency shall not adopt a rule until the public comment period has ended. If the agency fails to take action on a proposed rule within two years after the notice of proposed rulemaking is published in the New Mexico register, the rulemaking is automatically terminated unless the agency takes action to extend the period. The agency may extend the period of time for adopting the proposed rule for an additional period of two years by filing a statement of good cause for the extension in the rulemaking record, but it shall provide for additional public participation, comments and rule hearings prior to adopting the rule.\n\nC. An agency may terminate a rulemaking at any time by publishing a notice of termination in the New Mexico register. If a rulemaking is terminated pursuant to this section, the agency shall provide notice to the public.\n\nD. Within fifteen days after adoption of a rule, an agency shall file the adopted rule with the state records administrator or the administrator's designee and shall provide to the public the adopted rule. The state records administrator or the administrator's designee shall publish rules as soon as practicable after filing, but in no case later than ninety days after the date of adoption of the proposed rule. Unless a later date is otherwise provided by law or in the rule, the effective date of a rule shall be the date of publication in the New Mexico register.\n\nE. A proposed rule shall not take effect unless it is adopted and filed within the time limits set by this section.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 71-7-6, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 275, § 6; 1969, ch. 92, § 4; 1995, ch. 110, § 4; 2017, ch. 137, § 3.\n\nThe 2017 amendment,effective July 1, 2017, prohibited agencies from adopting rules until the public comment period has ended, provided time limits on adoption of proposed rules after the public notice period, required the state records administrator to publish the rule within 90 days after the date of adoption of proposed rules, and provided for termination of the rulemaking if no action is taken on a proposed rule within two years after notice is published; in the catchline, added \"Time limit on adoption of a proposed rule\"; added subsection designation \"A.\"; in Subsection A, added \"Except in the case of an emergency rule\", and after \"until it is\", deleted \"filed with the records center and\"; added Subsections B and C; added subsection designation \"D.\"; in Subsection D, added the first two sentences of the subsection, after \"provided by law\", added \"or in the rule\", and deleted \"Emergency regulations may go into effect immediately upon filing with the records center, but shall be effective no more than thirty days unless they are published in the New Mexico register\"; and added Subsection E.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, added the section heading, substituted the language at the end of the first sentence beginning \"filed with\" for \"so filed and shall only be valid and enforceable upon such filing and compliance with any other law\", and added the last two sentences.\n\nWhen rule becomes valid or enforceable.— The language of this section is categorical: a rule is not valid or enforceable until it is filed. There is no implicit exception that makes the rule effective before filing with respect to those with actual notice of the rule.Pineda v. Grande Drilling Corp., 1991-NMCA-004, 111 N.M. 536, 807 P.2d 234.\n\nPrisoner disciplinary rules not covered by act.— Disciplinary rules promulgated by the secretary of corrections, governing the conduct of prisoners confined within a penitentiary, were not required to be filed with the state's record center in the manner required under State Rules Act.Johnson v. Francke, 1987-NMCA-029, 105 N.M. 564, 734 P.2d 804.\n\nNo fundamental right to notice and hearing.— There is no fundamental right to notice and hearing before the adoption of a rule. Such a right is statutory only.Livingston v. Ewing, 1982-NMSC-110, 98 N.M. 685, 652 P.2d 235.\n\nElection rules.— Secretary of state's memorandum # 80-50 which listed the name variations which could be counted for the various write-in candidates, and required the precinct officials to list all of the variations, was never filed in the records center as required by Section 14-4-5 NMSA 1978 and was void.Weldon v. Sanders, 1982-NMSC-136, 99 N.M. 160, 655 P.2d 1004.\n\nActual notice of rule does not dispel necessity of compliancewith State Rules Act.State v. Joyce, 1980-NMCA-086, 94 N.M. 618, 614 P.2d 30.\n\nEffect of failure to comply with statutory requirements.— Where the board of cosmetology failed to (1) comply with the repeal procedure of 12-8-4A NMSA 1978, in failing to give notice to interested parties and to hold a hearing prior to taking action, and (2) failed to file the record of its regulatory proceedings with the state records administrator as required by this section, the action of the board in repealing a licensing reciprocity regulation was contrary to law and the repeal was invalid.Rivas v. Board of Cosmetologists, 1984-NMSC-076, 101 N.M. 592, 686 P.2d 934.\n\nEffect of unfiled rules and regulations.— Former statutes (4-10-13 to 4-10-19, 1953 Comp.) did not provide that all unfiled rules and regulations were ineffective, but merely provided that such rules and regulations would not be valid as against any person who did not have actual knowledge of their contents.Maestas v. Christmas, 1958-NMSC-021, 63 N.M. 447, 321 P.2d 631.\n\nAmendment has no effect on validity of previous resolution.— The subsequent adoption of an amended resolution has no effect on the validity of a previous resolution.Livingston v. Ewing, 1982-NMSC-110, 98 N.M. 685, 652 P.2d 235.\n\nCriminal trespass charges not a means to enforce rule until filing.— Criminal trespass charges under 30-20-13 NMSA 1978 are not a means to enforce a rule available to the state until the rule is properly filed in compliance with State Rules Act.State v. Joyce, 1980-NMCA-086, 94 N.M. 618, 614 P.2d 30.\n\nPolicies that affect other agencies.— If a policy manual or directive contains statements of policy purporting to affect one or more agencies besides the agency issuing the manual or to affect persons not members or employees of the issuing agency, it must be filed in accordance with the State Rules Act. 1993 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 93-01.\n\nStatute does not authorize center to investigate validity of rules.— The statute makes no provision for a preliminary investigation by the records center with respect to the compliance of the submitting agency to any notice and hearing requirements. As an administrative body, the records center can only act within the scope of the authority delegated by statute, and any independent investigation into the validity of the rules and regulations submitted for filing does not come within the records center's authority; therefore the records center has no power to make a determination as to whether, in fact, the promulgating agency has complied with notice and hearing requirements. 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-07.\n\nOrders and decisions excluded by definition from class of rulesto which State Rules Act applies are not subject to the provisions of those sections and, in particular, are not governed by 14-4-3 NMSA 1978 and this section. 1979 Op.

No. 79-32.\n\nWhat and with whom matters to be filed.— Formerly, all official reports, pamphlets, publications, regulations, rules, codes of fair competition, proclamations and orders issued, prescribed or promulgated by the state corporation commission (now public regulation commission) of general application were to be filed, in accordance with statute, with the supreme court librarian of the state of New Mexico, with the exception of any rule or regulation or order or other document of the corporation commission (now public regulation commission), wherein it is exercising its duty of fixing, determining, supervising, regulating and controlling all charges and rates of railway, express, telephone, telegraph, sleeping car or similar company and common carrier within the state. 1953 Op.

The New Mexico register shall be published in such a way as to minimize the cost to the state. To accomplish this, the state records administrator is authorized to provide for charges for subscriptions and for publication of notice and other items, including advertising, in the register.\n\nB. The New Mexico register shall be the official publication for all notices of rule makings and filings of adopted rules, including emergency rules, by agencies.\n\n(1) The register shall include the full text of any adopted rules, including emergency rules. Proposed rules may be published in full or in part at the discretion of the issuing agency.\n\n(2) Upon request of an issuing agency, the state records administrator may determine that publication in the register of the full text of an adopted rule would be unduly cumbersome, expensive or otherwise inexpedient, and may publish instead a synopsis of the adopted rule and a statement that a copy of the rule is available from the issuing agency.\n\nC. The New Mexico register shall be available by subscription and single copy purchase to any person, including agencies of the executive, judicial and legislative branches of state government and its political subdivisions, at a reasonable charge approved by the state records administrator. The administrator may authorize distribution of a certain number of copies of the register without charge to agencies or political subdivisions as deemed economically feasible and appropriate.\n\nD. The New Mexico register may include a summary or the text of any governor's executive order, a summary, listing or the text of any attorney general's opinion, a calendar listing the date, time and place of all or selected agency rule-making hearings, a list of gubernatorial appointments of state officials and board and commission members or other material related to administrative law and practice.\n\nE.

Att'y Gen. No. 93-02.\n\nNotice requirements for legal publication.— A notice published in the New Mexico register would not fulfill the requirements for legal publication under 14-11-1 to 14-11-8 NMSA 1978 because the register is not a newspaper of general paid circulation. 1993 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 93-02.\n\nPublication in human services register.— Publication of a notice, proposed rule, or adopted rule in the New Mexico human services register does not fulfill the human services department's [health care authority department's] duty to publish materials required by the New Mexico register. 1993 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 93-02.\n\nPublication requirements under the Administrative Procedures Act.— The state rules administrator was not required to publish a separate bulletin under former 12-8-6 NMSA 1978 for agencies subject to the Administrative Procedures Act. Specifically, the provisions of this section superseded the requirements in former 12-8-6 NMSA 1978 for issuing a bimonthly publication, for publishing the full text of rules except under the specified conditions and for providing bulletins free of charge to state agencies and political subdivisions upon request. 1993 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 93-03.\n\nIncorporation by reference.— An agency may not avoid filing and publishing a rule by incorporating by reference any otherwise properly filed and published rule. However, this section grants the state records administrator and the issuing agency discretion to agree on publication of less than a full text of incorporated materials. 1993 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 93-01.",
