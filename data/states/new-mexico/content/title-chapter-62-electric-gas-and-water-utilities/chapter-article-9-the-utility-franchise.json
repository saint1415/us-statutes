      "text": "A. No public utility shall begin the construction or operation of any public utility plant or system or of any extension of any plant or system without first obtaining from the commission a certificate that public convenience and necessity require or will require such construction or operation. This section does not require a public utility to secure a certificate for an extension within any municipality or district within which it lawfully commenced operations before June 13, 1941 or for an extension within or to territory already served by it, necessary in the ordinary course of its business, or for an extension into territory contiguous to that already occupied by it and that is not receiving similar service from another utility. If any public utility or mutual domestic water consumer association in constructing or extending its line, plant or system unreasonably interferes or is about to unreasonably interfere with the service or system of any other public utility or mutual domestic water consumer association rendering the same type of service, the commission, on complaint of the public utility or mutual domestic water consumer association claiming to be injuriously affected, may, upon and pursuant to the applicable procedure provided in Chapter 62, Article 10 NMSA 1978, and after giving due regard to public convenience and necessity, including reasonable service agreements between the utilities, make an order and prescribe just and reasonable terms and conditions in harmony with the Public Utility Act to provide for the construction, development and extension, without unnecessary duplication and economic waste.\n\nB. If a certificate of public convenience and necessity is required pursuant to this section for the construction or extension of a generating plant or transmission lines and associated facilities, a public utility may include in the application for the certificate a request that the commission determine the ratemaking principles and treatment that will be applicable for the facilities that are the subject of the application for the certificate. If such a request is made, the commission shall, in the order granting the certificate, set forth the ratemaking principles and treatment that will be applicable to the public utility's stake in the certified facilities in all ratemaking proceedings on and after such time as the facilities are placed in service. The commission shall use the ratemaking principles and treatment specified in the order in all proceedings in which the cost of the public utility's stake in the certified facilities is considered. If the commission later decertifies the facilities, the commission shall apply the ratemaking principles and treatment specified in the original certification order to the costs associated with the facilities that were incurred by the public utility prior to decertification.\n\nC. The commission may approve the application for the certificate without a formal hearing if no protest is filed within sixty days of the date that notice is given, pursuant to commission order, that the application has been filed. The commission shall issue its order granting or denying the application within nine months from the date the application is filed with the commission. Failure to issue its order within nine months is deemed to be approval and final disposition of the application; provided, however, that the commission may extend the time for granting approval for an additional six months for good cause shown.\n\nD. In an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for an energy storage system, the commission shall approve energy storage systems that:\n\n(1) reduce costs to ratepayers by avoiding or deferring the need for investment in new generation and for upgrades to systems for the transmission and distribution of energy;\n\n(2) reduce the use of fossil fuels for meeting demand during peak load periods and for providing ancillary services;\n\n(3) assist with ensuring grid reliability, including transmission and distribution system stability, while integrating sources of renewable energy into the grid;\n\n(4) support diversification of energy resources and enhance grid security;\n\n(5) reduce greenhouse gases and other air pollutants resulting from power generation;\n\n(6) provide the public utility with the discretion, subject to applicable laws and rules, to operate, maintain and control energy storage systems so as to ensure reliable and efficient service to customers; and\n\n(7) are the most cost effective among feasible alternatives.\n\nE. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"energy storage system\" means methods and technologies used to store electricity; and\n\n(2) \"mutual domestic water consumer association\" means an association created and organized pursuant to the provisions of:\n\n(a) Laws 1947, Chapter 206; Laws 1949, Chapter 79; or Laws 1951, Chapter 52; or\n\n(b) the Sanitary Projects Act [Chapter 3, Article 29 NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:Laws 1941, ch. 84, § 46; 1941 Comp., § 72-701; 1953 Comp., § 68-7-1; Laws 1965, ch. 289, § 10; 1967, ch. 96, § 1; 1990, ch. 95, § 1; 2000, ch. 51, § 1; 2005, ch. 340, § 1; 2019, ch. 65, § 25.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Sections 62-9-1 to 62-9-7 of the Public Utility Act are still effective as the repeal of Chapter 62, Article 6 by Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, effective July 1, 2003 Chapter 108, Section 82 was repealed prior to taking effect by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003. Although Laws 2003, Chapter 336, Section 8, amended Laws 1998, Chapter 82, as amended, an amendment of a repealed section is ineffective.SeeQuintana v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 100 N.M. 224, 668 P.2d 1101 (1983). Laws 2003, Chapter 416, Section 5 also repealed Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, as amended, a second time, however, that repeal is of no effect as the section had previously been repealed by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective June 14, 2019, provided guidelines for the public regulation commission when reviewing for approval an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for an energy storage system, and defined \"energy storage system; added a new Subsection D and redesignated former Subsection D as Subsection E; and in Subsection E, added a new Paragraph E(1) and redesignated former Paragraphs E(1) and E(2) as Subparagraphs E(2)(a) and E(2)(b), respectively.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective July 1, 2005, added Subsection B to provide for the determination of the rate making principles and treatment that will be applicable for a facility that is subject to a certificate of public convenience and necessity; and added Subsection C to provide for the approval of the certificate of public convenience and necessity without a hearing.\n\nThe 2000 amendment,effective May 17, 2000, designated the existing provisions of the section as Subsection A, and in Subsection A deleted \"after the effective date of this 1941 act\" following \"No public utility shall\" in the first sentence, substituted \"June 13, 1941\" for \"the effective date of this 1941 act\" in the second sentence, deleted \"Notwithstanding any other provision of the Public Utility Act, as amended, or any privilege granted under that act\" from the beginning of the third sentence, and added Subsection B.\n\nThe 1990 amendment,effective May 16, 1990, inserted \"or mutual domestic water consumer association\" following \"public utility\" in three places, substituted \"Chapter 62, Article 10 NMSA 1978\" for \"Sections 68-8-1 through 68-8-16 New Mexico Statutes Annotated, 1953 Compilation\" in the third sentence and made numerous stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nConstitutionality.— The preference in this section indicated by its protection of mutual domestic water consumer associations from invasion by a regulated utility but not from an unregulated utility does not lack a rational basis, and an argument that it unconstitutionally discriminates against the invaded utility solely on the basis of the status of the invader was without merit.Morningstar Water Users Ass'n v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 1995-NMSC-062, 120 N.M. 579, 904 P.2d 28 (decided prior to 2000 amendment).\n\nDeference to commission interpretation.— The court will defer to the public regulation commission's interpretation of the ambiguous phrase \"unreasonably interfere with the service or system\" because the public regulation commission has policy-making authority to plan and coordinate the activities of New Mexico public utilities and because the public regulation commission has developed the expertise to understand the operation of public utilities.Do a Ana Mut. Domestic Water Consumers Ass'n v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2006-NMSC-032, 140 N.M. 6, 139 P.3d 166.\n\nInterpretation of \"unreasonably interfere with the service or system\".— The public regulation commission interpretation of the phrase \"unreasonably interfere with the service or system\", which presumes that all contiguous territory lies within a utility's \"service or system\", and its definition of \"contiguous\" to include territory within one-half mile of a public utility's pipes or facilities are not arbitrary or capricious.Do a Ana Mut. Domestic Water Consumers Ass'n v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2006-NMSC-032, 140 N.M. 6, 139 P.3d 166.\n\nSubstantial evidence of interference.— Evidence that encroachment by a competing public utility on the service area of an objecting public utility would interfere with the objecting public utility's physical system, planning to provide future service and ability to realize economies of scale for its customers is substantial evidence of interference with the service or system of the objecting public utility.Do a Ana Mut. Domestic Water Consumers Ass'n v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2006-NMSC-032, 140 N.M. 6, 139 P.3d 166.\n\nState engineer approval of water rightsobtained by an encroaching public utility to be used in disputed service area occupied by another public utility does not preclude the public regulation commission from entering an order denying the encroaching public utility the right to provide service in the disputed area.Do a Ana Mut. Domestic Water Consumers Ass'n v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2006-NMSC-032, 140 N.M. 6, 139 P.3d 166.\n\nWater users association not within commission's jurisdiction.— A water users association formed under Chapter 73, Article 5 NMSA 1978 was not a mutual domestic water consumer within the meaning of this section; further, absent any evidence showing the association was subject to the Public Utility Act, it did not come within the jurisdiction of the public utility commission (now public regulation commission).Morningstar Water Users Ass'n v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 1995-NMSC-062, 120 N.M. 579, 904 P.2d 28 (decided prior to 2000 amendment).\n\nCity not within commission's jurisdiction.— A city operating a water facility which had not elected to come under the Public Utility Act and which had a population of less than 200,000 was not a public utility within the jurisdiction of the public utility commission (now public regulation commission).Morningstar Water Users Ass'n v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 1995-NMSC-062, 120 N.M. 579, 904 P.2d 28 (decided prior to 2000 amendment).\n\nCertificate is needed for construction, but not for extensions where lawfully operating.— This section prohibits construction of any facilities for public utility service without first obtaining a certificate of convenience and necessity, and provides that the holder of a certificate need not get a permit for extensions within a district where it has lawfully commenced operations, or to territory being served by it and necessary in the ordinary course of its business.N.M. Elec. Serv. Co. v. Lea Cnty. Elec. Coop., 1966-NMSC-046, 76 N.M. 434, 415 P.2d 556, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 969, 87 S. Ct. 506, 17 L. Ed. 2d 433.\n\nNew certificate not required for service to few transferred customers.— It is not required that utility obtain a new certificate for the purpose of providing service to a few customers who are to be transferred to it from another utility.Gonzales v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1985-NMSC-038, 102 N.M. 529, 697 P.2d 948.\n\n1967 amendment to this section did not annul appellant's certificateof public convenience and necessity which was valid at the date of amendment.Pub. Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1974-NMSC-045, 86 N.M. 255, 522 P.2d 802.\n\nOther provisions govern revocation of certificate.— If the commission is assumed to have power to revoke a certificate, the authority as well as the procedure therefor is found in Sections 62-10-1 to 62-10-16 NMSA 1978 rather than in Sections 62-9-1 and 62-9-4 NMSA 1978, as contended by the commission.Pub. Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1974-NMSC-045, 86 N.M. 255, 522 P.2d 802;N.M. Elec. Serv. Co. v. Lea Cnty. Elec. Coop., 1966-NMSC-046, 76 N.M. 434, 415 P.2d 556, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 969, 87 S. Ct. 506, 17 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1966).\n\nCommission cannot deny right to continue under valid certificate.— The commission cannot deny to service company its right to continue in the area covered by its certificate if its certificate has been exercised as required by Section 62-9-4 NMSA 1978, or, in other words, if its certificate is valid in the area sought to be served by it, even though other public utilities have overlapping or conflicting certificates; furthermore, the commission cannot hold existing franchise rights null and void, nor can it make an order which would conflict with Section 62-9-2 B NMSA 1978, which states that when certificates granted utilities under that section overlap, certificates theretofore issued and exercised within the time required are valid under Section 62-9-4 NMSA 1978 and both utilities shall be permitted to continue service.Pub. Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1974-NMSC-045, 86 N.M. 255, 522 P.2d 802;N.M. Elec. Serv. Co. v. Lea Cnty. Elec. Coop., 1966-NMSC-046, 76 N.M. 434, 415 P.2d 556, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 969, 87 S. Ct. 506, 17 L. Ed. 2d 433.\n\nEven though commission could find certificate void under this section.— A conclusion that the certificate of a public service company was null and void, if based upon proper findings, could probably be made in determining the issues in a hearing under this section as a necessary incident of the larger questions presented thereunder.Pub. Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1974-NMSC-045, 86 N.M. 255, 522 P.2d 802;N.M. Elec. Serv. Co. v. Lea Cnty. Elec. Coop., 1966-NMSC-046, 76 N.M. 434, 415 P.2d 556, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 969, 87 S. Ct. 506, 17 L. Ed. 2d 433.\n\nIf holder does not exercise certificate in time.— A certificate of public convenience and necessity cannot be declared null and void in the absence of findings by the commission, based upon substantial evidence, that the certificate holder failed to exercise its right with diligence.Pub. Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1974-NMSC-045, 86 N.M. 255, 522 P.2d 802;N.M. Elec. Serv. Co. v. Lea Cnty. Elec. Coop., 1966-NMSC-046, 76 N.M. 434, 415 P.2d 556, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 969, 87 S. Ct. 506, 17 L. Ed. 2d 433.\n\nFormerly, section did not apply to rural electric cooperatives.Socorro Elec. Coop. v. Pub. Serv. Co., 1959-NMSC-105, 66 N.M. 343, 348 P.2d 88; 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-31.\n\nSection does not apply to water and sanitation districts.— Water and sanitation districts are not required by statute to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity as are public utilities under the jurisdiction of the commission. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-56 (decided prior to 2000 amendment).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Cost of Service Indexing: An Analysis of New Mexico's Experiment in Public Utility Regulation,\" see 9 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Public Utility Act [Chapter 62, Articles 1 to 6 and 8 to 13 NMSA 1978], or any provision of the Municipal Code [Chapter 3 NMSA 1978, except Article 66], or any privilege granted under either act, if any municipality that has not elected to come within the terms of the Public Utility Act, as provided in Section 62-6-5 NMSA 1978, constructs or extends or proposes to construct or extend its water or sewer line or system or water pumping station or reservoir into a geographical area described in a certificate of public convenience and necessity granted by the commission to a public utility rendering the same type of service, the commission, on complaint of the public utility claiming to be injuriously affected thereby, shall, after giving notice to the municipality and affording the municipality an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issue of whether its water or sewer line, plant or system actually intrudes or will intrude into the area certificated to the public utility, determine whether such intrusion has occurred or will occur. If the commission determines such an intrusion has occurred or will occur, the municipality owning or operating the water or sewer utility shall cease and desist from making such construction or extension in the absence of written consent of the public utility involved and approval of the commission.\n\nB. The authority and jurisdiction conferred by Subsection A of this section shall be in addition and cumulative to the independent authority of the commission to determine territorial disputes between public utilities and between mutual domestic water consumer associations and public utilities as provided in Section 62-9-1 NMSA 1978, which provisions shall govern the resolution of a territorial dispute between a municipality that has elected to come within the terms of the Public Utility Act, as provided in Section 62-6-5 NMSA 1978, and any other public utility rendering the same type of service. Provided, however, in the event that a certificate of public convenience and necessity granted to such a municipality overlaps, or conflicts with, a valid certificate previously issued by the commission and exercised within the term required under Section 62-9-4 NMSA 1978, the municipal utility shall be permitted to continue operation of its plant, line and system in existence upon the effective date of this 1991 act and the other public utility may continue service in the area covered by its certificate, subject to the other provisions of the Public Utility Act.\n\nC. For purposes of this section, \"municipality\" means any municipality that has a population of more than two hundred thousand as determined in the most recent federal decennial census and is located in a class A county.\n\nHistory:Laws 1991, ch. 143, § 2.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Sections 62-9-1 to 62-9-7 of the Public Utility Act are still effective as the repeal of Chapter 62, Article 6 by Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, effective July 1, 2003 Chapter 108, Section 82 was repealed prior to taking effect by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003. Although Laws 2003, Chapter 336, Section 8, amended Laws 1998, Chapter 82, as amended, an amendment of a repealed section is ineffective.SeeQuintana v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 100 N.M. 224, 668 P.2d 1101 (1983). Laws 2003, Chapter 416, Section 5 also repealed Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, as amended, a second time, however, that repeal is of no effect as the section had previously been repealed by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.\n\nRight of municipality to provide service in the certified area of a public utility.— Where the public regulation commission issued the public utility a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the public utility to provide water in an area outside the limits of the municipality; the municipality later annexed three undeveloped tracts of land within the public utility's certified area, subdivided the land and committed itself to provide water to the subdivision; and the municipality had not elected to become subject to the Public Utilities Act, Section 62-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., and did not have a population of more than 200,000, the public utility's certificate of public convenience and necessity did not prevent the municipality from competing with the public utility in the certified area because the municipality was not subject to the Public Utilities Act.Moongate Water Co., Inc. v. City of Las Cruces, 2013-NMSC-018, 302 P.3d 405, aff'g 2012-NMCA-003, 269 P.3d 1.\n\nCertificate of convenience and necessity did not grant exclusive service rights against a small municipality.— A certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the public regulation commission does not grant a public utility service rights against a municipality that has a population less than or equal to two hundred thousand people and that has not elected to be subject to the Public Utility Act.Moongate Water Co., Inc. v. City of Las Cruces, 2012-NMCA-003, 269 P.3d 1, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere a privately owned and regulated public utility company held a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the public regulation commission to provide water service to residents in an area of new residential subdivisions; a municipality annexed the area, extended its water utility infrastructure into the area as part of its municipal water utility system, and began providing water service to residents in the area; and the municipality had a population of less than two hundred thousand and had not elected to be subject to the Public Utility Act, the certificate of convenience and necessity did not give the public utility exclusive service rights in the area against the municipal water system.Moongate Water Co., Inc. v. City of Las Cruces, 2012-NMCA-003, 269 P.3d 1, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-001.\n\nCity not within commission's jurisdiction.— A city operating a water facility which had not elected to come under the Public Utility Act and which had a population of less than 200,000 was not a public utility within the jurisdiction of the public utility commission (now public regulation commission).Morningstar Water Users Ass'n v.

Upon proof of the existence and operation of the plant, lines and system upon the effective date of this 1967 act, the commission shall grant the certificate to the utility.\n\nB. In the event the certificate granted a utility under Subsection A of this section overlaps or conflicts with a valid certificate heretofore issued by the commission and exercised within the time required under Section 62-9-4 NMSA 1978, both certificates shall be valid and both utilities shall be permitted to continue service subject to the other provisions of the Public Utility Act [Chapter 62, Articles 1 to 6 and 8 to 13 NMSA 1978], as amended.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 68-7-1.1, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 96, § 7; 1993, ch. 282, § 35.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1967, ch. 96, § 7, repealed 68-7-1.1, 1953 Comp., relating to applications by utilities covered by the Public Utility Act by virtue of Laws 1961, ch. 89, and enacted the above section.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The words \"this 1967 act,\" appearing in Subsection A, refer to Laws 1967, ch. 96, compiled as 62-3-1 to 62-3-4, 62-6-8, 62-8-8, 62-9-1, 62-9-2 and 62-9-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nSections 62-9-1 to 62-9-7 of the Public Utility Act are still effective as the repeal of Chapter 62, Article 6 by Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, effective July 1, 2003 Chapter 108, Section 82 was repealed prior to taking effect by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.

Upon proof of the existence and operation thereof upon the effective date of these 1987 amendments to the Public Utility Act, the commission shall grant to the utility such certificate. The commission shall enter upon a hearing to determine whether the rate or rates of such a sewer utility in effect on the effective date of these amendments to the Public Utility Act are just and reasonable pursuant to Subsection D of Section 62-8-7 NMSA 1978 upon the filing with the commission of protests signed by ten percent or more of the ratepayers receiving sewer service from such a sewer utility. For purposes of this section, each person who receives a separate bill equals one ratepayer and each person who receives multiple bills equals one ratepayer. The protest shall be signed by the person in whose name service is carried. The protests shall be filed no later than sixty days after the filing with the commission of an application by the sewer utility for a certificate of public convenience and necessity as prescribed by this section.

      "text": "A. The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to consider any adverse effect upon the environment and upon the quality of life of the people of the state that may occur due to plants, facilities and transmission lines needed to supply present and future electrical services. It is recognized that such plants, facilities and transmission lines will be needed to meet growing demands for electric services and cannot be built without in some way affecting the physical environment where these plants, facilities and transmission lines are located. The legislature therefore declares that it is the purpose of this section to provide for the supervision and control by the commission of the location within this state of new plants, facilities and transmission lines for the generation and transmission of electricity for sale to the public.\n\nB. A person, including any municipality, shall not begin the construction of any plant designed for or capable of operation at a capacity of three hundred thousand kilowatts or more for the generation of electricity for sale to the public within or without this state, whether or not owned or operated by a person that is a public utility subject to regulation by the commission, or of transmission lines in connection with such a plant, on a location within this state unless the location has been approved by the commission. For the purposes of this section, \"transmission line\" means any electric transmission line and associated facilities designed for or capable of operations at a nominal voltage of two hundred thirty kilovolts or more, to be constructed in connection with and to transmit electricity from a new plant for which approval is required.\n\nC. Application for approval shall contain all information required by the commission to make its determination, be made in writing setting forth the facts involved and be filed with the commission. The commission shall, after a public hearing and upon notice as the commission may prescribe, act upon the application. The commission may condition its approval upon a demonstration by the applicant that it has received all necessary air and water quality permits. A public utility regulated by the commission may submit an application pursuant to Section 62-9-1 NMSA 1978 for a certificate of public convenience and necessity prior to filing an application for location approval pursuant to this section in order to determine the need for the generating plant or transmission line prior to determination of the appropriate location.\n\nD. Approval shall not be required for additions to or modifications of an existing plant or transmission line.\n\nE. The commission shall approve the application for the location of the generating plant unless the commission finds that the operations of the facilities for which approval is sought will not be in compliance with all applicable air and water pollution control standards and regulations existing or will unduly impair system reliability. The commission shall not require compliance with performance standards other than those established by the agency of this state having jurisdiction over a particular pollution source.\n\nF. The commission shall approve the application for the location of the transmission lines unless the commission finds that the location will unduly impair important environmental values or the operation of the proposed transmission lines will unduly impair power system reliability.\n\nG. An application shall not be approved pursuant to this section that violates an existing state, county or municipal land use statutory or administrative regulation unless the commission finds that the regulation is unreasonably restrictive and compliance with the regulation is not in the interest of the public convenience and necessity, in which event and to the extent found by the commission, the regulation shall be inapplicable and void as to the siting. When it becomes apparent to the commission that an issue exists with respect to whether a regulation is unreasonably restrictive and compliance with the regulation is not in the interest of public convenience and necessity, it shall promptly serve notice of that fact by certified mail upon the agency, board or commission having jurisdiction for land use of the area affected and shall make the agency, board or commission a party to the proceedings upon its request and shall give it an opportunity to respond to the issue. The judgment of the commission shall be conclusive on all questions of siting, land use, aesthetics and any other state or local requirements affecting the siting.\n\nH. A public utility subject to the jurisdiction of the commission may elect to file an application pursuant to this section with the commission for location approval of an electric transmission line or associated facilities designed for or capable of operation at a nominal voltage of one hundred fifteen kilovolts or more but less than two hundred thirty kilovolts if:\n\n(1) the public utility files an application for construction, extension, rebuilding or improvement of the electric transmission line or associated equipment under any applicable county or municipal land use statute, ordinance or administrative regulation; and\n\n(2) the agency, board or commission of the county or municipality disapproves the application. For purposes of this subsection, \"disapprove\" means the failure of the county or municipal agency, board or commission to issue a final order approving the application within two hundred forty days of the public utility's filing of a complete application with the agency, board or commission. An application shall be deemed complete if within fifteen working days of the public utility's filing of the application, or a supplement or amendment thereto, the agency, board or commission fails to send written notice to the public utility enumerating the specific requirements under the applicable county or municipal land use statute, ordinance or administrative regulation that the application fails to satisfy.\n\nI. Upon consideration of the application and the standards set forth in Subsection G of this section, the commission may authorize construction, extension, rebuilding or improvement of the transmission line or facilities notwithstanding the prior disapproval of the county or municipal agency, board or commission. The judgment of the commission shall be conclusive on all questions of siting, land use, aesthetics and any other state or local requirements affecting the siting.\n\nJ. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to confer upon the commission power or jurisdiction to regulate or supervise any person, including a municipality, that is not otherwise a public utility regulated and supervised by the commission, with respect to its rates and service and with respect to its securities, nor shall any other provision of the Public Utility Act be applicable with respect to such a person, including a municipality.\n\nK. The commission may approve an application filed pursuant to this section without a formal hearing if no protest is filed within sixty days of the date that notice is given that the application has been filed. The commission shall issue its order granting or denying the application within six months from the date the application is filed with the commission; provided, however, that:\n\n(1) if a public utility simultaneously files an application for approval of location of a transmission line pursuant to this section and an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity pursuant to Subsection B of Section 62-9-1 NMSA 1978, the commission shall issue its order granting or denying the applications within nine months from the date the applications are filed with the commission; provided, however, that the commission may extend the time for granting approval an additional six months for good cause shown;\n\n(2) if a public utility files an application for approval of location of a transmission line pursuant to this section after its application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity has been approved pursuant to Subsection B of Section 62-9-1 NMSA 1978, the commission shall issue its order granting or denying the application for approval of location of a transmission line within ninety days from the date the application is filed with the commission; and\n\n(3) if a public utility files an application for approval of location of a transmission line pursuant to this section while its application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity is pending pursuant to Subsection B of Section 62-9-1 NMSA 1978, and the application for a certificate is subsequently approved, the commission shall issue its order granting or denying the application for approval of location of a transmission line within ninety days from the date the application for certificate of public convenience and necessity is approved.\n\nL. Failure to issue its order approving or denying an application filed pursuant to this section within the time periods set forth in Subsection [J] K of this section is deemed to be approval of the application; provided, however, that the commission may extend the time for granting approval for a transmission line that is subject to this section for an additional nine months upon finding that the additional time is necessary to determine if the proposed location of the line will unduly impair important environmental values.\n\nM. In determining if the proposed location of the transmission line will unduly impair important environmental values, the commission may consider the following factors:\n\n(1) existing plans of the state, local government and private entities for other developments at or in the vicinity of the proposed location;\n\n(2) fish, wildlife and plant life;\n\n(3) noise emission levels and interference with communication signals;\n\n(4) the proposed availability of the location to the public for recreational purposes, consistent with safety considerations and regulations;\n\n(5) existing scenic areas, historic, cultural or religious sites and structures or archaeological sites at or in the vicinity of the proposed location; and\n\n(6) additional factors that require consideration under applicable federal and state laws pertaining to the location.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 68-7-1.2, enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 248, § 1; 2001, ch. 303, § 1; 2005, ch. 339, § 6; 2005, ch. 340, § 2.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Sections 62-9-1 to 62-9-7 of the Public Utility Act are still effective as the repeal of Chapter 62, Article 6 by Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, effective July 1, 2003 Chapter 108, Section 82 was repealed prior to taking effect by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003. Although Laws 2003, Chapter 336, Section 8, amended Laws 1998, Chapter 82, as amended, an amendment of a repealed section is ineffective.SeeQuintana v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 100 N.M. 224, 668 P.2d 1101 (1983). Laws 2003, Chapter 416, Section 5 also repealed Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, as amended, a second time, however, that repeal is of no effect as the section had previously been repealed by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.\n\nCross references.— For public utilities subject to jurisdiction of commission,see62-3-3 G, 62-3-4, 62-6-4 and 62-6-5 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor regulation of issuance of securities,see62-6-7 and 62-6-8 NMSA 1978.\n\n2005 Multiple Amendments.— Laws 2005, ch. 339, § 6 and Laws 2005, ch. 340, § 2, both effective July 1, 2005, enacted different amendments to this section that can be reconciled. Pursuant to 12-1-8 NMSA 1978, Laws 2005, ch. 340, § 2, as the last act signed by the governor, is set out above and incorporates both amendments. The amendments enacted by Laws 2005, ch. 339, § 6, and Laws 2005, ch. 340, § 2 are described below. To view the session laws in their entirety,seethe 2005 session laws onNMOneSource.com.\n\nThe nature of the difference between the amendments is that Laws 2005, ch. 339, §6, made substantive changes dealing with system reliability, and also made several minor technical changes. Laws 2005, ch. 340, § 2, provided that a public utility may apply for a certificate of public convenience and necessity before applying for location approval in order to determine the need for the plant or line prior to a determination of the appropriate location, provided a list of conditions that permit a public utility to file an application for location approval for an electric transmission line, provided for the authorization of a transmission line that has been disapproved by a county or municipal agency, board or commission, provided that the commission may approve an application without a hearing if no protest is filed within sixty days after notice has been given that an application has been filed, provided that if a public utility simultaneously files an application for location approval and an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, the commission shall issue its order within nine months after the applications are filed, provided that if a public utility files an application for location approval after an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity has been approved, the commission shall issues its order within ninety days after the application is filed, and that if a public utility files an application for location approval while its application for public convenience and necessity is pending and the application for a certificate is subsequently approved, the commission shall issues its order within ninety days after the application for a certificate is approved, provided that failure to issue its order approving or denying an application filed pursuant to this section within the time periods set forth in this section is deemed to be approval of the application, and provided criteria for determining if a location of a transmission line will unduly impair environmental value.\n\nLaws 2005, ch. 340, § 2, effective July 1, 2005, provided in Subsection C that a public utility may apply for a certificate of public convenience and necessity before applying for location approval in order to determine the need for the plant or line prior to a determination of the appropriate location; deleted the former provision in Subsection E, which provided that no approval is required for construction in progress on the effective date of this section; added Subsection H to provide for the conditions that permit a public utility to file an application for location approval for an electric transmission line; added Subsection I to provide for the authorization of a transmission line that has been disapproved by a county or municipal agency, board or commission; provided in Subsection K that the commission may approve an application without a hearing if no protest is filed within sixty days after notice has been given that an application has been filed; added Subsection K (1) through (3) to provide that if a public utility simultaneously files an application for location approval and an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, the commission shall issue its order within nine months after the applications are filed; provided that if a public utility files an application for location approval after an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity has been approved, the commission shall issue its order within ninety days after the application is filed; and that if a public utility files an application for location approval while its application for public convenience and necessity is pending and the application for a certificate is subsequently approved, the commission shall issue its order within ninety days after the application for a certificate is approved; provided in Subsection L that failure to issue its order approving or denying an application filed pursuant to this section within the time period set forth in Subsection J is deemed approval and deleted for former time period of six month within which the commission had to issue an order; and added Subsection M to provide criteria for determining if a location of a transmission line will unduly impair environmental value.\n\nLaws 2005, ch. 339, § 6, effective July 1, 2005, changed \"lines\" to \"transmission lines\" in Subsection A; provided in Subsection E that the commission shall approve the location of the plant unless the commission finds that the operations of the facilities will unduly impair system reliability; and provided in Subsection F that the commission shall approve the location of the transmission lines unless the commission finds that the operation of the transmission lines will unduly impair power system reliability, and provided:\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, deleted \"within this state\" following \"a public utility subject to regulation by the commission\" in Subsection B; deleted former Subsection C, concerning application for approval by an existing public utility; redesignated the subsequent subsections; in present Subsection C, deleted \"If a person is not a public utility regulated by the commission\" from the beginning of the subsection, added the \"all information\" requirement, and added the approval condition at the end of the subsection; substituted \"section\" for \"act\" in current Subsection D; added Subsection I; and made stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nScope of commission authority.Because the legislature empowered the public regulation commission to modify the common-law rule of relocation only for local regulations deemed unreasonable under Subsection G of this section, a tariff permitting the Public Service Company of New Mexico to recover relocation costs was ultra vires where the commission made no finding that the ordinance requiring the relocation was unreasonable.City of Albuquerque v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2003-NMSC-028, 134 N.M. 472, 79 P.3d 297.\n\nThe commission's attempt to preempt local regulations imposing the costs of relocation on the Public Service Company of New Mexico was an unlawful infringement on the power of local governments to regulate the use of public ways by utilities.City of Albuquerque v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2003-NMSC-028, 134 N.M. 472, 79 P.3d 297.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"The Public Service Commission: A Legal Analysis of an Administrative System,\" see 3 N.M.L.

Dep't of Corrs., 100 N.M. 224, 668 P.2d 1101 (1983). Laws 2003, Chapter 416, Section 5 also repealed Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, as amended, a second time, however, that repeal is of no effect as the section had previously been repealed by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.\n\nCross references.— For definition of \"commission,\"see62-3-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor denial of service by public utility being petty misdemeanor,see30-13-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, provided that in considering public necessity, the commission shall consider the impact the abandonment of service on all customers served, directly or indirectly, by the facilities sought to be abandoned.\n\nThe 1983 amendmentdeleted \"regulated\" at the end of the catchline and rewrote the text of the section.\n\nConstitutionality of commission's actions.— Exclusion of an electric utility's interest in a generating facility from its rate base, coupled with the commission's refusal to decertify the facility, did not violate the due process provisions or the takings clauses of the New Mexico and United States constitutions.Public Serv. Co. v. Public. Serv. Comm'n, 1991-NMSC-083, 112 N.M. 379, 815 P.2d 1169.\n\nConstruction of section.— The first part of this section refers to \"continuation of service\", while the second part addresses \"continuation of the service or use of the facility\". Thus, the section is written in the disjunctive to provide not for alternative bases upon which decertification of facilities is authorized, but for distinct factual scenarios giving rise to abandonment.Public Serv. Co. v. Public. Serv. Comm'n, 1991-NMSC-083, 112 N.M. 379, 815 P.2d 1169.\n\nJurisdiction of municipal condemnation of public utility.— This section and Section 62-6-12A(4) NMSA 1978 (sale of assets) do not give the commission jurisdiction over municipal condemnations of regulated water and sewer utilities.United Water N.M., Inc. v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 1996-NMSC-007, 121 N.M. 272, 910 P.2d 906.\n\nCertificate is no longer necessary for abandonment of service;all that is required is the commission's permission and approval.Gonzales v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 1985-NMSC-038, 102 N.M. 529, 697 P.2d 948.\n\nApplication to sale of vacant land.— Sale of 41 vacant acres within 2,564-acre electric utility site was not an \"abandonment\" of a \"facility,\" and did not require the permission and approval of the commission.Plains Elec. Generation & Transmission Coop. v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 1998-NMSC-038, 126 N.M. 152, 967 P.2d 827.\n\nBurden of proof.— Utility, as the movant for abandonment, bore the burden to establish the factual predicate upon which the commission could base its decision to grant or deny abandonment.Public Serv. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 1991-NMSC-083, 112 N.M. 379, 815 P.2d 1169.\n\nUtility's assertion that \"exclusion from rates of the 26.10% interest in that unit . . . represents a loss in terms of capital costs alone of $19.8 million a year\" fell short of the required showing, where the utility failed to demonstrate with any degree of certainty the overall impact continued regulation had on its financial condition.Public Serv. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 1991-NMSC-083, 112 N.M. 379, 815 P.2d 1169.\n\nMandamus was the appropriate remedy where the New Mexico public regulation commission refused to follow a nondiscretionary duty.— Where petitioners filed an emergency petition on behalf of the state of New Mexico seeking a writ of mandamus against the New Mexico public regulation commission (commission) to direct the commission and its individual commissioners to apply the Energy Transition Act (ETA), 62-18-1 to 62-18-23 NMSA 1978, to proceedings related to public service company of New Mexico's (PNM) abandonment of units one and four of the San Juan generating station (San Juan), and where the commission asserted that the ETA did not apply because abandonment proceedings had already begun prior to the ETA's enactment, petition for writ of mandamus was granted because the commission did not have the authority to initiate an abandonment proceeding, and as a matter of law, abandonment proceedings for San Juan units one and four did not effectively begin until PNM filed its application for abandonment, which was after the ETA was enacted. The ETA serves as the statutory scheme that the legislature provided for abandonment proceedings, and therefore the commission had a nondiscretionary obligation to apply the ETA to the San Juan abandonment proceedings.State ex rel.

Every applicant for a certificate shall give such reasonable notice of its application as the commission may require and shall file in the office of the commission such evidence as shall be required by the commission to show that such applicant has received the consent and franchise from the municipality wherein construction and operation is proposed. The commission shall have power, after hearing, to issue said certificate, as prayed for, or to refuse to issue the same, or to issue it for the construction or operation of a portion only of the contemplated facility, line, plant or system, or extension thereof, or for the partial exercise only of said rights or privilege, and may attach to the exercise of the rights granted by said certificates such terms and conditions in harmony with the Public Utility Act [Chapter 62, Articles 1 to 6 and 8 to 13 NMSA 1978], as amended, as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require. Except as otherwise provided in Section 62-9-2 New Mexico Statutes Annotated, 1978 Compilation, in determining whether any certificate shall issue as prayed for, the commission shall give due regard to public convenience and necessity including, but not limited to, any reasonable service agreement between the applicant and another utility and unnecessary duplication and economic waste. Whenever a public utility is engaged or is about to engage in construction or operation without having secured a certificate of public convenience and necessity as required by the provisions of the Public Utility Act, as amended, any interested person may file a complaint with the commission. The commission may, with or without notice, make its order requiring the public utility complained of to cease and desist from such construction or operation until the commission makes and files its decision on said complaint or until the further order of the commission. The commission may after hearing, after reasonable notice, make such order and prescribe such terms and conditions in harmony with the Public Utility Act, as amended, as are just and reasonable.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 68-7-4, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 96, § 8.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1967, ch. 96, § 8, repealed 68-7-4, 1953 Comp., relating to application for and issuance or denial of certificates, and enacted a new section.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Sections 62-9-1 to 62-9-7 of the Public Utility Act are still effective as the repeal of Chapter 62, Article 6 by Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, effective July 1, 2003 Chapter 108, Section 82 was repealed prior to taking effect by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.
