      "text": "Any party to any proceeding before the commission may file a notice of appeal in the supreme court asking for a review of the commission's final orders. If an application for rehearing has been filed, a notice of appeal must be filed within thirty days after the application for rehearing has been refused or deemed refused because of the commission's failure to act within the time specified in Section 62-10-16 NMSA 1978. If an application for rehearing has not been filed, a notice of appeal must be filed within thirty days after the entry of the commission's final order. Every notice of appeal shall name the commission as appellee and shall identify the order from which the appeal is taken. Any person whose rights may be directly affected by the appeal may appear and become a party, or the supreme court may, upon proper notice, order any person to be joined as a party.\n\nHistory:Laws 1941, ch. 84, § 66; 1941 Comp., § 72-901; 1953 Comp., § 68-9-1; Laws 1965, ch. 289, § 14; 1982, ch. 109, § 11; 1993, ch. 282, § 38.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Sections 62-11-1 to 62-11-6 of the Public Utility Act are still effective as the repeal of Chapter 62, Article 6 by Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, effective July 1, 2003 Chapter 108, Section 82 was repealed prior to taking effect by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003. Although Laws 2003, Chapter 336, Section 8, amended Laws 1998, Chapter 82, as amended, an amendment of a repealed section is ineffective.SeeQuintana v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 100 N.M. 224, 668 P.2d 1101 (1983). Laws 2003, Chapter 416, Section 5 also repealed Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, as amended, a second time, however, that repeal is of no effect as the section had previously been repealed by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, made minor stylistic changes in the first and second sentences, and deleted \"New Mexico public service\" preceding \"commission\" in the next-to-last sentence.\n\nRequiring exhaustion of remedies is constitutional.— The requirement of the Public Utility Act that a person first exhaust his administrative remedy before resorting to the courts does not violate N.M. Const., art. VI, § 13, granting general jurisdiction to the district courts except as elsewhere limited in such constitution.Smith v. Southern Union Gas Co., 1954-NMSC-033, 58 N.M. 197, 269 P.2d 745.\n\nSection liberally applied in determining standing for review.— The language \"[a]ny party to any proceeding before the commission\" is broad and requires liberal application in determining standing for review pursuant to this section.Community Pub. Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1983-NMSC-026, 99 N.M. 493, 660 P.2d 583.\n\nCourts have jurisdiction to vacate unlawful administrative order.— The statutory provisions for limited review of an order of a commission by the district court do not oust the courts of jurisdiction to annul and vacate a final administrative order as unlawful.Llano, Inc. v. Southern Union Gas Co., 1964-NMSC-257, 75 N.M. 7, 399 P.2d 646.\n\nComplete administrative remedy for testing rates is provided.— The Public Utility Act envelops the commission with an aura of broad power and jurisdiction to determine just and reasonable rates and sets up a complete remedy within the framework of the act for testing their propriety and reasonableness.Potash Co. of Am. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1956-NMSC-091, 62 N.M. 1, 303 P.2d 908.\n\nAction will be dismissed if remedies have not been exhausted.— Where plaintiff brought action to enjoin commission from enforcing new gas rates and to recover amounts paid without waiting for final determination in pending statutory review proceeding, complaint was properly dismissed because plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies.Potash Co. of Am. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1956-NMSC-091, 62 N.M. 1, 303 P.2d 908.\n\nStandard of review for appealis whether there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency's decision.Gonzales v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 1985-NMSC-038, 102 N.M. 529, 697 P.2d 948.\n\nReview limited.— On appeals from administrative bodies the questions to be answered by the court are questions of law and are restricted to whether the administrative body acted fraudulently, arbitrarily or capriciously, whether the order was supported by substantial evidence and, generally, whether the action of the administrative body was within the scope of its authority.Maestas v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1973-NMSC-096, 85 N.M. 571, 514 P.2d 847;Llano, Inc. v. Southern Union Gas Co., 1964-NMSC-257, 75 N.M. 7, 399 P.2d 646.\n\nSection 62-12-2 applicable.— Where it is alleged that the public regulation commission is acting outside the scope of its jurisdiction or refusing to perform under the Public Utility Act, Section 62-12-2 NMSA 1978 is applicable.City of Sunland Park v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2004-NMCA-024, 135 N.M. 143, 85 P.3d 267, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-002, 135 N.M. 169, 86 P.3d 47.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"The Public Service Commission: A Legal Analysis of an Administrative System,\" see 3 N.M.L.

Generation & Transmission Coop. v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 1998-NMSC-038, 126 N.M. 152, 967 P.2d 827.\n\nGrounds required for reversal.— The party challenging a commission decision must show that agency action falls within one of the oft-mentioned grounds for reversal, including: whether the decision is arbitrary and capricious; whether it is supported by substantial evidence; and whether it represents an abuse of the agency's discretion by being outside the scope of the agency's authority, clear error, or violative of due process.Morningstar Water Users Ass'n v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 1995-NMSC-062, 120 N.M. 579, 904 P.2d 28.\n\nBurden of proving construction was not commenced in time.— The burden was on petitioners-landowners, as the moving parties before the commission, to demonstrate by substantial evidence, and thereby prove to the commission, that electrical cooperative failed to commence construction of a transmission line and related facilities within the time prescribed by Section 62-9-4 NMSA 1978.Lone Mountain Cattle Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1972-NMSC-008, 83 N.M. 465, 493 P.2d 950.\n\nWhen commission's construction of certificate and statutes is binding.— The commission's construction of the certificate issued by it and the statutes governing its operation was binding on review, unless this construction was unreasonable or unlawful.Lone Mountain Cattle Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1972-NMSC-008, 83 N.M. 465, 493 P.2d 950.\n\nUtility's request for proposal process was not arbitrary or capricious.— Where the public service company of New Mexico (PNM) submitted an application for the public regulation commission (PRC) to approve its renewable energy procurement plan for the year 2018, and where, in its application, PNM sought to demonstrate its compliance with the Renewable Energy Act, 62-16-1 to -10 NMSA 1978, requirements and obtain the PRC's approval of renewable energy procurements, the PRC's approval of PNM's solar energy procurement plan was not unreasonable or unlawful, because PNM's request for proposal (RFP) gave all bidders a fair opportunity to participate and compete for PNM's selection, and evidence in the record demonstrates that the challenged aspects of PNM's RFP were consistent with industry standards.N.M. Indus. Energy Consumers v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2019-NMSC-015.\n\nPublic Regulation Commission's summary fact-finding procedure denied qualifying facility due process.— In a case that arose under the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), which was designed to encourage the development of small power production facilities in order to diversify the nation's energy sources and thereby reduce the demand for traditional fossil fuels, where appellant filed a petition with the New Mexico public regulation commission (PRC), contending that it is a \"qualifying facility\" under PURPA and requested that the PRC enter an order declaring that Lea county electric is obligated under PURPA to purchase the energy and capacity that appellant produces and determine the proper \"avoided costs\" Lea county electric is required to pay appellant for its energy and capacity, and where the PRC determined that it would process appellant's filing as a complaint subject to the formal complaint process set forth in its rules of procedure and not as a petition for a declaratory order, and where the PRC further summarily dismissed the complaint with prejudice, finding that the affidavits and supporting documentation constituted substantial evidence that Lea county electric transferred its mandatory purchase obligation to another electric utility which served as Lea county electric's \"full-requirements\" supplier, the New Mexico supreme court vacated and annulled the PRC's final order, because the summary fact-finding procedure employed by the PRC violated due process when it precluded appellant from presenting evidence and developing a record on the disputed full-requirements issue. The PRC's decision was also not supported by substantial evidence, and was therefore arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.D Resolute Wind 1 LLC v. N.M. Pub. Regul.

The court has no power to modify the order of the commission.Moyston v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1966-NMSC-062, 76 N.M. 146, 412 P.2d 840.\n\nSupreme court is limited to affirming or reversing lower court.— Because of the form of this section (prior to the 1982 amendment), supreme court was limited in its disposition of cause to affirming or reversing the lower court, and the cause cannot be remanded to permit the commission to supply necessary findings.N.M. Elec. Serv. Co. v. Lea Cnty. Elec. Coop., 1966-NMSC-046, 76 N.M. 434, 415 P.2d 556, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 969, 87 S. Ct. 506, 17 L.

Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-042, 92 N.M. 721, 594 P.2d 1177.\n\nCommission decision not upheld without substantial evidence.— Although every inference is to be drawn in support of the commission's decision, a reviewing court may not uphold a commission's decision which is not supported by substantial evidence.Public Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-042, 92 N.M. 721, 594 P.2d 1177.\n\nQuestions of fact are for commission, not court.— Whether or not the construction had been commenced on a certain date is a question of fact to be determined by the commission.Lone Mountain Cattle Co. v.

N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1972-NMSC-008, 83 N.M. 465, 493 P.2d 950.\n\nOnce commission's order is annulled and vacated,a rate case is in the same posture it was in before the original decision was rendered: the commission may hold additional hearings and take additional testimony just as if the vacated order had never been entered; however, because the proposed rates may be put into effect after expiration of the initial nine-month period, the commission will have every reason to act expeditiously to enter new findings based on substantial evidence.Public Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-042, 92 N.M. 721, 594 P.2d 1177.\n\nRegulation held neither arbitrary nor capricious.— The question of a potential for abuse in a regulation allowing company to adjust consumers' rates relative to change in the company's cost prior to the approval by the commission in that the company could negotiate contracts with its subsidiaries who supply 26% of its natural gas at favorable rates, and thereby accrue hidden profits, was a question of fact for the commission to decide, and as the commission's findings were supported by substantial evidence, this regulation was neither arbitrary nor capricious.Maestas v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1973-NMSC-096, 85 N.M. 571, 514 P.2d 847.\n\nCommission's finding of fact held supported by substantial evidence.— Considering petitioner's burden of proof, the nature and extent of the evidence adduced and the qualifications of the commission in knowing and understanding what is meant by \"surveys\" and \"construction,\" in the sense in which these terms are used in the construction of power transmission lines and related facilities, the commission's finding of fact was supported by substantial evidence, and it is not the province of the court to substitute its judgment for that of the commission.Lone Mountain Cattle Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1972-NMSC-008, 83 N.M. 465, 493 P.2d 950.\n\nCommission's order held unsupported by substantial evidence.— Where gas company seeking rate increase proposed to trend the general plant account items by using a nationally recognized index, but the commission instead inserted its own method - to simply use the untrended original cost, although the witness who strongly supported this approach admitted that he did not know whether this would accurately establish the reproduction cost of the items, the court held the commission's order was unreasonable, being unsupported by substantial evidence.Southern Union Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1972-NMSC-072, 84 N.M. 330, 503 P.2d 310.\n\nCommission's establishment of a two-tiered rate plan that allowed residential customers to elect between a higher customer access fee combined with a lower distribution charge per therm, or choose a lower customer access fee combined with a higher distribution charge was not supported by the evidence.Attorney Gen. v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 2000-NMSC-008, 128 N.M. 747, 998 P.2d 1198.\n\nCommission's order in a utility-rate proceeding was vacated and remanded because its decision on the disallowance of gas company's actual tax expenses was arbitrary, its determination of zero cash working capital was lacking a basis in substantial evidence and the amount of its award for aircraft expenses was unsupported by substantial evidence.Zia Natural Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 2000-NMSC-011, 128 N.M. 728, 998 P.2d 564.\n\nIn its final order regarding a gas utility's requested rate increase, the commission's denial of recovery of losses on reacquired debt, the denial of the opportunity for the utility to recover reservation fees in a separate proceeding, the denial of certain settlement expenses and rate case expenses, and the dramatic increase in the residential access charge were not supported by substantial evidence.PNM Gas Servs. v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 2000-NMSC-012, 129 N.M. 1, 1 P.3d 383.\n\nFactors considered in rate hearing.Public Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-042, 92 N.M. 721, 594 P.2d 1177.\n\nDeparture from prior practice without notice.— A regulatory body cannot, without prior notice, abruptly depart from past practice on which the regulatee has relied and impose a retroactive refund requirement upon the regulatee. However, once notice was given, nothing prevented the commission from adopting a new regulatory practice and applying it prospectively; if the regulatee chose not to comply, it did so at its own peril.Hobbs Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1993-NMSC-032, 115 N.M. 678, 858 P.2d 54.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"The Public Service Commission: A Legal Analysis of an Administrative System,\" see 3 N.M.L.

      "text": "The pendency of an appeal shall not of itself stay or suspend the operation of the order of the commission, but, during the pendency of such proceedings, the supreme court in its discretion may stay or suspend, in whole or in part, the operation of the commission's order on such terms as it deems just and in accordance with the practice of courts exercising equity jurisdiction. If the supreme court stays or suspends the operation of an order of the commission, pending a review of the order, the court may require the party seeking the stay or suspension to secure the other parties against loss due to the delay in the enforcement of the order, in case the order on appeal is affirmed, in such amount and in such form as the supreme court shall direct.\n\nHistory:Laws 1941, ch. 84, § 71; 1941 Comp., § 72-906; 1953 Comp., § 68-9-6; Laws 1982, ch. 109, § 15; 1983, ch. 250, § 4.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Sections 62-11-1 to 62-11-6 of the Public Utility Act are still effective as the repeal of Chapter 62, Article 6 by Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, effective July 1, 2003 Chapter 108, Section 82 was repealed prior to taking effect by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003. Although Laws 2003, Chapter 336, Section 8, amended Laws 1998, Chapter 82, as amended, an amendment of a repealed section is ineffective.SeeQuintana v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 100 N.M. 224, 668 P.2d 1101 (1983). Laws 2003, Chapter 416, Section 5 also repealed Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, as amended, a second time, however, that repeal is of no effect as the section had previously been repealed by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.\n\nCross references.— For definition of \"commission,\"see62-3-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1983 amendmentinserted \"stay or suspend commission's order\" at the end of the catchline and substituted \"If the supreme court stays or suspends the operation of an order of the commission, pending a review of the order, the court may require the party seeking the stay or suspension to secure\" for \"Any party shall have the right to secure from the supreme court an order suspending or staying the operation of an order of the commission, pending a review of such order, by securing\" in the second sentence.\n\nA party looking to stay a public regulation commission final order must seek a stay from the commission before requesting a stay from the New Mexico supreme court.— Where El Paso electric company (El Paso electric) submitted its 2018 annual renewable energy plan to the New Mexico public regulation commission (commission), in which El Paso electric sought a ten-year extension of its agreement with the Camino Real energy facility to purchase renewable energy certificates at a price of $30 per megawatt hour of renewable energy, which doubled the $15 per megawatt hour price for the certificates under its expiring agreement with the Camino Real facility, and where the commission issued a final order approving the proposal, and where the city of Las Cruces (city) filed a notice of appeal with the New Mexico supreme court seeking review of the commission's final order and requesting that the court stay the portion of the commission's order that approved El Paso electric's agreement with the Camino Real facility, the city was required to first seek a stay from the commission, because a party is required to pursue relief from an administrative agency, where available, before seeking redress from the courts, which allows for the development of a complete factual record and preserves the New Mexico supreme court's role as a court of review. City of Las Cruces v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2020-NMSC-016.\n\nThe New Mexico public regulation commission retains jurisdiction to act on a stay request following a final order.— Where El Paso electric company (El Paso electric) submitted its 2018 annual renewable energy plan to the New Mexico public regulation commission (commission), in which El Paso electric sought a ten-year extension of its agreement with the Camino Real energy facility to purchase renewable energy certificates at a price of $30 per megawatt hour of renewable energy, which doubled the $15 per megawatt hour price for the certificates under its expiring agreement with the Camino Real facility, and where the commission issued a final order approving the proposal, the commission was within its authority to grant the city of Las Cruces' motion for stay despite a pending appeal, because the commission retains jurisdiction to act on a stay request following a final order.City of Las Cruces v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2020-NMSC-016.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"The Public Service Commission: A Legal Analysis of an Administrative System,\" see 3 N.M.L. Rev. 184 (1973).",
