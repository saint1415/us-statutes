Although Laws 2003, Chapter 336, Section 8, amended Laws 1998, Chapter 82, as amended, an amendment of a repealed section is ineffective.SeeQuintana v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 100 N.M. 224, 668 P.2d 1101 (1983). Laws 2003, Chapter 416, Section 5 also repealed Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, as amended, a second time, however, that repeal is of no effect as the section had previously been repealed by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.\n\nCross references.— For commission jurisdiction over rates,see62-6-4 NMSA 1978 and notes thereto.\n\nFor commission jurisdiction over water and sanitation district rates,see73-21-16 L NMSA 1978.\n\nBalancing of interests required.— To set a just and reasonable rate, the commission must balance the investor's interest against the ratepayer's interest.In re Timeron Water Co., 1992-NMSC-047, 114 N.M. 154, 836 P.2d 73.\n\nRate requests carried out under Section 62-8-7 NMSA 1978.— Section 62-8-7 NMSA 1978 is the provision under which the overall purpose of this section is carried out for the given instance of a rate request.Otero Cnty. Elec. Coop. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1989-NMSC-033, 108 N.M. 462, 774 P.2d 1050.\n\nCommission not limited in method of valuating utility or setting rates.— Neither New Mexico case law nor the Public Utility Act imposes any one particular method of valuation upon the commission in ascertaining the rate base of a utility; nor does the spirit of the statute tie the commission down to the consideration of a single factor in establishing rates.Hobbs Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1980-NMSC-005, 94 N.M. 731, 616 P.2d 1116.\n\nAs commission is vested with considerable discretionin determining whether a rate to be received and charged is just and reasonable.Hobbs Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1980-NMSC-005, 94 N.M. 731, 616 P.2d 1116.\n\nCommission's remedy for utility's imprudent decision was reasonable.— Where PNM appealed the New Mexico public regulation commission's (commission) denial of recovery in its rate base for the repurchase of 64.1 MW of capacity and certain lease renewals at Palo Verde nuclear generating station (Palo Verde), and where the commission found that PNM's decisions were imprudent on the basis that PNM had failed to demonstrate that it considered alternative courses of action, the commission's remedy of disallowing recovery for the amount PNM paid for the 64.1 MW over the net book value of that capacity and allowing PNM to recover the costs of the five renewed leases was reasonable and lawful. The commission established valuations for the 64.1 MW and the renewed lease, which it considered appropriate to protect ratepayers and result in just and reasonable rates, and such an approach is a lawful and reasonable exercise of the commission's authority to determine the rate base of a utility and its obligation to ensure that rates are just and reasonable. It was reasonable and lawful for the commission to conclude that a total disallowance was not justified.Public Serv. Co. of N.M. v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2019-NMSC-012.\n\nCommission did not exceed its authority in denying utility's recovery for costs.— Where PNM appealed the New Mexico public regulation commission's (commission) decision to deny it recovery for the costs of converting certain San Juan generating station units to a balanced draft system, which is designed to reduce fugitive emissions, on the grounds that PNM had failed to demonstrate that these costs were prudently incurred, the commission was within its authority in denying recovery, because the commission's finding that balanced draft was included in the permits for San Juan at PNM's request and not because it was required by the applicable environmental regulation was a finding specifically concerning the reasonableness of costs PNM was seeking to include in its rate base and was squarely within the authority of the commission to regulate the rates of public utilities and the obligation of the commission to ensure that those rates are just and reasonable.Public Serv. Co. of N.M. v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2019-NMSC-012.\n\nDiscretion to review rates efficiently.— The statutory scheme vests broad discretion in the commission to review utility rates in an efficient and reasonable manner.Otero Cnty. Elec. Coop. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1989-NMSC-033, 108 N.M. 462, 774 P.2d 1050.\n\nAssignment of issue to separate proceeding.— The commission may assign an issue raised in a rate request hearing to a separate proceeding.Otero Cnty. Elec. Coop. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1989-NMSC-033, 108 N.M. 462, 774 P.2d 1050.\n\nIf plant acquisition adjustment is included as legitimate plant cost,it becomes a part of the rate base upon which a rate of return is to be computed.Hobbs Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1980-NMSC-005, 94 N.M. 731, 616 P.2d 1116.\n\nOrdering increase in contract rate is within commission's jurisdiction.— Where the commission had entered an order authorizing a public utility to enter into a contract and to continue to charge the gas rate therein specified until further order and on the ex parte petition of the utility subsequently entered an interlocutory order making a rate increase to be effective until the commission could hold a hearing to determine and set a new and proper rate, the commission was moving strictly in conformity with the act creating it to determine one of the major questions submitted to its jurisdiction - a question of rates.Potash Co. of Am. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1956-NMSC-091, 62 N.M. 1, 303 P.2d 908.\n\nBurden of proof on utility.— The legislature has granted the commission discretion to place the burden of proof on the utility in any rate proceeding.Otero Cnty. Elec. Coop. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1989-NMSC-033, 108 N.M. 462, 774 P.2d 1050.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"The Public Service Commission: A Legal Analysis of an Administrative System,\" see 3 N.M.L.

S. Union Gas Co., 472 F.2d 707 (10th Cir. 1973).\n\nStandard of care for power company.— A power company engaged in distributing electric current over its wires to consumers is not an insurer of the safety of the consumer or anyone else, although the company must exercise a high degree of care to protect those likely to come in contact with its wires. The care required is that commensurate with the dangerous character of the business and consistent with its practical operation and extends not only to the erection, maintenance and operation of the company's plant and apparatus, but also to an inspection thereof and to the discovery of defects.Southwestern Pub. Serv. Co. v. Artesia Alfalfa Growers' Ass'n, 1960-NMSC-052, 67 N.M. 108, 353 P.2d 62.\n\nDuty to furnish service is imposed by law.— The duty of a public utility to furnish adequate, efficient and reasonable service is imposed by law, separate and apart from any contractual obligation to its consumers and entirely apart from any pertinent matters filed with the commission.Southwestern Pub. Serv. Co. v. Artesia Alfalfa Growers' Ass'n, 1960-NMSC-052, 67 N.M. 108, 353 P.2d 62.\n\nA public utility's obligation to provide adequate, efficient and reasonable service is statutory and not contractual and there is no obligation that provides for a utility to continue electrical service to a customer for an indefinite term at a set rate.Gonzales v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 1985-NMSC-038, 102 N.M. 529, 697 P.2d 948.\n\nCommission cannot relieve utility of liability for negligence.— The authority of the commission is sufficiently broad to empower it to establish rules and regulations for the government of the utility in the prosecution of its business, but such public service commission (now public regulation commission) cannot relieve a utility from liability under the law of negligence by any rule it may adopt.Southwestern Pub. Serv. Co. v. Artesia Alfalfa Growers' Ass'n, 1960-NMSC-052, 67 N.M. 108, 353 P.2d 62.\n\nUtility cannot contract against its negligence.— A public service corporation, or a public utility such as an electric company, cannot contract against its negligence in the regular course of its business or in performing one of its duties of public service or where a public duty is owed or where public interest is involved.Southwestern Pub.

      "heading": "Change in rates.",
      "text": "A. At any hearing involving an increase in rates or charges sought by a public utility, the burden of proof to show that the increased rate or charge is just and reasonable shall be upon the utility.\n\nB. Unless the commission otherwise orders, no public utility shall make any change in any rate that has been duly established except after thirty days' notice to the commission, which notice shall plainly state the changes proposed to be made in the rates then in force and the time when the changed rates will go into effect and other information as the commission by rule requires. The utility shall also give notice of the proposed changes to other interested persons as the commission may direct. All proposed changes shall be shown by filing new schedules that shall be kept open to public inspection. The commission for good cause shown may allow changes in rates without requiring the thirty days' notice, under conditions that it may prescribe.\n\nC. Whenever there is filed with the commission by any public utility a complete application as prescribed by commission rule proposing new rates, the commission may, upon complaint or upon its own initiative, except as otherwise provided by law, upon reasonable notice, enter upon a hearing concerning the reasonableness of the proposed rates. If the commission determines a hearing is necessary, it shall suspend the operation of the proposed rates before they become effective but not for a longer initial period than nine months beyond the time when the rates would otherwise go into effect, unless the commission finds that a longer time will be required, in which case the commission may extend the period for an additional three months. The commission shall hear and decide cases with reasonable promptness. The commission shall adopt rules identifying criteria for various rate and tariff filings to be eligible for suspension periods shorter than what is allowed by this subsection and to be eligible for summary approval without hearing.\n\nD. If after a hearing the commission finds the proposed rates to be unjust, unreasonable or in any way in violation of law, the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rates to be charged or applied by the utility for the service in question and shall fix the rates by order to be served upon the utility or the commission by its order shall direct the utility to file new rates respecting such service that are designed to produce annual revenues no greater than those determined by the commission in its order to be just and reasonable. Those rates shall thereafter be observed until changed, as provided by the Public Utility Act [Chapter 62, Articles 1 to 6 and 8 to 13 NMSA 1978].\n\nE. Except as otherwise provided by law, any increase in rates or charges for the utility commodity based upon cost factors other than taxes or cost of fuel, gas or purchased power, filed for after April 4, 1991, shall be permitted only after notice and hearing as provided by this section. The commission shall enact rules governing the use of tax, fuel, gas or purchased power adjustment clauses by utilities that enable the commission to consider periodically at least the following:\n\n(1) whether the existence of a particular adjustment clause is consistent with the purposes of the Public Utility Act, including serving the goal of providing reasonable and proper service at fair, just and reasonable rates to all customer classes;\n\n(2) the specific adjustment mechanism to recover tax, gas, fuel or purchased power costs;\n\n(3) which costs should be included in an adjustment clause, procedures to avoid the inclusion of costs in an adjustment clause that should not be included and methods by which the propriety of costs that are included may be determined by the commission in a timely manner, including what informational filings are required to enable the commission to make such a determination; and\n\n(4) the proper adjustment period to be employed.\n\nF. Except as otherwise provided by law, any increase in rates or charges for a public utility as defined in Paragraph (3) of Subsection G of Section 62-3-3 NMSA 1978 based upon cost factors other than taxes or cost of fuel, gas, purchased power or acquisition of water resources shall be permitted only after notice and hearing as provided by this section. For the purposes of this subsection, \"acquisition of water resources\" does not include the purchase or other permanent acquisition of water rights. The commission shall enact rules governing the use of tax, fuel, gas, purchased power or water resource acquisition adjustment clauses by such utilities that enable the commission to consider periodically at least the following:\n\n(1) whether the existence of a particular adjustment clause is consistent with the purposes of the Public Utility Act, including serving the goal of providing reasonable and proper service at fair, just and reasonable rates to all customer classes;\n\n(2) the specific adjustment mechanism to recover tax, gas, fuel, purchased power or acquisition of water resource costs;\n\n(3) which costs should be included in an adjustment clause, procedures to avoid the inclusion of costs in an adjustment clause that should not be included and methods by which the propriety of costs that are included may be determined by the commission in a timely manner, including what informational filings are required to enable the commission to make such a determination; and\n\n(4) the proper adjustment period to be employed.\n\nG. The commission may eliminate or condition a particular adjustment clause if it finds such elimination or condition is consistent with the purposes of the Public Utility Act, including serving the goal of providing reasonable and proper service at fair, just and reasonable rates to all customer classes; provided, however, that no such elimination or condition shall be ordered unless such elimination or condition will not place the affected utility at a competitive disadvantage. The commission rules shall also provide for variances and may provide for separate examination of a utility's adjustment clause based upon that utility's particular operating characteristics.\n\nH. Whenever there is filed with the commission a schedule proposing new rates by a rural electric cooperative organized under the Rural Electric Cooperative Act [Chapter 62, Article 15 NMSA 1978] or by a foreign distribution cooperative, the rates shall become effective as proposed by the rural electric cooperative or the foreign distribution cooperative without a hearing, except as provided in this subsection. The rural electric cooperative or the foreign distribution cooperative shall give written notice of the proposed rates to its affected patrons in New Mexico at least thirty days prior to the filing with the commission. Upon the filing with the commission of a protest setting forth grounds for review of the proposed rates signed by the lesser of one percent of or twenty-five members of a customer rate class of the rural electric cooperative or foreign distribution cooperative and if the commission determines that there is just cause for reviewing the proposed rates on one or more of the grounds of the protest, the commission shall suspend the rates and conduct a hearing concerning the reasonableness of any proposed rates filed by a rural electric cooperative or a foreign distribution cooperative pursuant to Subsections C and D of this section. The protest shall be filed no later than twenty days after the filing with the commission of the schedule proposing the new rates. The hearing and review shall be limited to the issues set forth in the protest and for which the commission may find just cause for the review, which issues shall be contained in the notice of hearing. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to affect commission authority or procedure to regulate the sale, furnishing or delivery by wholesale suppliers of electricity to rural electric cooperatives or foreign distribution cooperatives pursuant to Section 62-6-4 NMSA 1978. In addition to the adjustments permitted by Subsections E and G of this section, the commission may authorize rate schedules of rural electric cooperatives and foreign distribution cooperatives to recover, without notice and hearing, changes in the cost of debt capital incurred pursuant to securities that are lawfully issued. This subsection shall not apply to any foreign distribution cooperative that proposes rates for any of its customer rate classes in the state that are higher than the rates it charges to the same or substantially similar customer rate class in the state under the laws of which the foreign distribution cooperative is organized. For the purposes of this subsection:\n\n(1) \"foreign distribution cooperative\" means a rural electric distribution cooperative corporation serving its members at retail and transacting business in New Mexico pursuant to the authority granted under Section 62-15-26 NMSA 1978;\n\n(2) \"member of a foreign distribution cooperative\" means a retail customer in New Mexico serviced by a foreign distribution cooperative; and\n\n(3) \"member of a rural electric cooperative\" means a member as defined by the Rural Electric Cooperative Act.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 62-8-7, enacted by Laws 1991, ch. 251, § 1; 1998, ch. 108, § 48; 2003, ch. 416, § 4; 2007, ch. 186, § 1; 2011, ch. 155, § 1; 2011, ch. 170, § 1.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1991, ch. 251, § 1 repealed former 62-8-7 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1985, ch. 221, § 2, relating to change in rates, and enacted the above section, effective April 4, 1991.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Sections 62-8-1 to 62-8-9 of the Public Utility Act are still effective as the repeal of Chapter 62, Article 6 by Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, effective July 1, 2003 Chapter 108, Section 82 was repealed prior to taking effect by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003. Although Laws 2003, Chapter 336, Section 8, amended Laws 1998, Chapter 82, as amended, an amendment of a repealed section is ineffective.SeeQuintana v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 100 N.M. 224, 668 P.2d 1101 (1983). Laws 2003, Chapter 416, Section 5 also repealed Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, as amended, a second time, however, that repeal is of no effect as the section had previously been repealed by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.\n\n2011 Multiple Amendments.— Laws 2011, ch. 155, § 1 and 2011, ch. 170, § 1 enacted different amendments to this section that can be reconciled. Pursuant to 12-1-8 NMSA 1978, 2011, ch. 170, § 1, as the last act signed by the governor, is set out above and incorporates both amendments. The amendments enacted by Laws 2011, ch. 155, § 1 and 2011, ch. 170, § 1 are described below. To view the session laws in their entirety,seethe 2011 session laws onNMOneSource.com.\n\nLaws 2011, ch. 170, § 1, effective July 1, 2011, in Subsection G, permitted foreign distribution cooperatives to increase rates, without a hearing, if the proposed rates are not higher than the rates the cooperative charged in the state in which it is organized; permitted the commission to suspend the cooperative's rates if there is a protest by the specified number of customers; and added definitions of \"foreign distribution cooperative\" and \"member of a foreign distribution cooperative\".\n\nLaws 2011, ch. 155, § 1, effective July 1, 2011, added Subsection F to permit water utilities to increase rates, without notice and hearing, based on taxes, the cost of fuel, gas and purchased power, and the cost to purchase or acquire permanent water rights.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective July 1, 2007, in Subsection G, required that a petition for hearing be signed by the lesser of one percent or twenty-five members of a customer class.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, substituted \"that are lawfully issued\" for \"the issuance of which are approved by the commission\" following \"pursuant to securities\" in Subsection G.\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective January 1, 1999, deleted \"as provided in this section\" near the beginning of Subsection A; in Subsection B, substituted \"that\" for \"which\" at the beginning and inserted \"and other information as the commission by rule requires\" near the middle; rewrote Subsection C; in Subsection E, substituted \"April 4, 1991\" for \"the effective date of this section\" near the middle and deleted \"and regulations\" preceding \"shall enact rules\" near the end; and added Subsection F, redesignated former Subsection F as Subsection G and made minor stylistic changes in Subsection G.\n\nFranchise fees are not items included in adjustment clauses.— Franchise fees charged by counties pursuant to Section 62-1-3 NMSA 1978 are not within the jurisdiction of the public regulation commission by analogy to fuel and purchased power adjustment clauses, over which the commission has jurisdiction under Section 62-8-7 NMSA 1978.El Paso Elec. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2010-NMSC-048, 149 N.M. 174, 246 P.3d 443.\n\nDenial of due process.— Where PNM appealed the New Mexico public regulation commission's (commission) denial of recovery in its rate base for the repurchase of 64.1 MW of capacity and certain lease renewals at Palo Verde nuclear generating station (Palo Verde), and where the commission found that PNM's actions in renewing and reacquiring the leases exposed ratepayers to costs associated with nuclear decommissioning responsibilities that likely would not have been incurred had an alternative resource other than nuclear been selected and denied recovery for all future nuclear decommissioning costs, the commission denied PNM's right to due process of law, because PNM was not given sufficient notice of a potential permanent disallowance of all recovery for its future contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trusts and was not afforded an opportunity to be heard on the issue..Public Serv. Co. of N.M. v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2019-NMSC-012.\n\nAdequate public notice.— Where a public utility applied for an emergency fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause; the public regulation commission published a public notice of the proceedings which stated that the public utility had asked the commission to implement the proposed fuel and purchase power cost clause and to include conditions to mitigate the impact on customer bills during peak periods and incentives to the public utility to control costs, that the public utility contended that it was experiencing serious cash flow problems, that it was at risk of losing its investment grade rating, that it was experiencing a loss of overall financial integrity, and that the lack of a fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause would result in the downgrading of the public utility's credit rating, and that because of the serious concerns raised by the public utility regarding its imminent financial crisis, the commission had established an expedited procedural schedule for reviewing the emergency fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause; and the commission subsequently decided that the public utility's financial condition was not relevant to the issue of whether the commission should grant the emergency fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause, the notice properly informed the public of the arguments raised in the public utility's application and of the expedited procedural schedule, was not inadequate or misleading, and did not deny the intervenors procedural due process.Albuquerque Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth. v. NMPRC, 2010-NMSC-013, 148 N.M. 21, 229 P.3d 494.\n\nExpedited procedural schedule.— Where a public utility applied for a rate increase and a fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause; a hearing examiner appointed by the public regulation commission issued a recommendation that the application for the fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause be denied; the public utility then applied for an emergency fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause; the commission severed the emergency application from the underlying rate case and determined that the commission would take administrative notice of any evidence relevant to the emergency application that was in the underlying rate case; intervenors participated in the underlying rate case; because the public utility contended that it was facing an immediate and critical financial crisis due to the lack of appropriate recovery of rapidly escalating fuel and purchased power costs, the commission established an expedited procedural schedule for reviewing the public utility's application which required the intervenors to file testimony within nine days after notice of the proceeding had been published; and the commission subsequently granted the intervenors two extensions of time which extended the time period in which the intervenors were required to file their responsive testimony from 12 to 42 days, the commission's denial of the intervenors' additional requests for extensions of time was not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable and did not deny the intervenors procedural due process.Albuquerque Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth. v. NMPRC, 2010-NMSC-013, 148 N.M. 21, 229 P.3d 494.\n\nFailure of commissioners to attend public hearings on matters on which they vote.— Where a public utility applied for an emergency fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause; the public regulation commission held public hearings on the public utility's application; two members of the commission who voted in favor of the public utility's application did not personally attend many of the public hearings; and the intervenors did not present any evidence to support their claim that the two commissioners failed to review the evidentiary record prior to voting, the intervenors failed to show they were denied their procedural due process right to a full and fair hearing.Albuquerque Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth. v. NMPRC, 2010-NMSC-013, 148 N.M. 21, 229 P.3d 494.\n\nFailure of commissioners to recuse themselves.— Where a public utility applied for an emergency fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause; the public utility contended that it was facing an immediate and critical financial crisis due to the lack of appropriate recovery of rapidly escalating fuel and purchased power costs; at a hearing that was held before the commission held public hearings on the merits of the public utility's application, two commissioners argued that in view of the public utility's financial crisis, the commission should grant the public utility interim relief on its application; the intervenors filed a motion requesting that the two commissioners recuse themselves from participating in the proceeding on the grounds that they had prejudged the merits of the public utility's application; and the two commissioners declined to recuse themselves, the intervenors were not denied their procedural due process right to a fair and impartial hearing.Albuquerque Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth. v. NMPRC, 2010-NMSC-013, 148 N.M. 21, 229 P.3d 494.\n\nTo require a utility to offset its fuel and purchased power costs against cost-savings in other areaswould undermine the direct and automatic nature of the cost recovery system inherent in the fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause authorized by Subsection E of Section 62-8-7 NMSA 1978.Albuquerque Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth. v. NMPRC, 2010-NMSC-013, 148 N.M. 21, 229 P.3d 494.\n\nRecovery of costs of prudency review audit.— Where a public utility applied for an emergency fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause; the public regulation commission approved the fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause and required the public utility to pay the costs of an independent prudency review of its fuel and purchased power costs by auditors selected by and under the direction of the commission; and after issuance of the commission's order approving the fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause, the commission issued a request for proposals to select a qualified auditor which summarized the scope of the audit and the scope of the prudence review, the independent audit provided for sufficient regulatory oversight.Albuquerque Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth. v. NMPRC, 2010-NMSC-013, 148 N.M. 21, 229 P.3d 494.\n\nFiling schedule of rate changes.— Where a public utility applied for an emergency fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause; the public utility notified the public regulation commission of its proposed rate changes in the application; the public was notified of the proposed rate changes when the commission published notice of the proceedings; the commission's final order granting the fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause required the public utility to file new schedules for the fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause within five days after the date of the final order; and the public utility filed new schedules six days before the fuel and purchase power cost adjustment clause went into effect, the public utility complied with the substantive requirements of Subsection B of Section 62-8-7 NMSA 1978.Albuquerque Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth. v. NMPRC, 2010-NMSC-013, 148 N.M. 21, 229 P.3d 494.\n\nRegulation 17.9.550.17(A)(2) NMAC does not require a showing that fuel and purchased power costs are volatile or fluctuate more than some other cost of providing service.Albuquerque Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth. v. NMPRC, 2010-NMSC-013, 148 N.M. 21, 229 P.3d 494.\n\nSubstantial evidence supported finding that costs fluctuate and cannot be determined in a rate case.— Where a public utility applied for an emergency fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause and the public utility provided testimony that prices for all fuels had increased substantially and had become more volatile compared with past years, fuel and purchased power prices and off system sales were difficult to predict for rate setting purposes, financial markets downgrade the credit rating of public utilities that do not have fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clauses, natural gas will be an increasing percentage of the public utility's fuel base, purchased power agreements will have variable fuel costs based on natural gas prices, natural gas prices have evidenced 50% to 60% price swings, and the public utility's long term contracts for nuclear fuel and coal were not fixed price contracts, the commission's findings that the public utility's fuel and purchased power costs periodically fluctuate and cannot be precisely determined in a rate case were supported by substantial evidence.Albuquerque Bernalillo Cnty. Water Util. Auth. v. NMPRC, 2010-NMSC-013, 148 N.M. 21, 229 P.3d 494.\n\nPurchased power.— Renewable energy certificates unaccompanied by the purchase of the renewable energy that the certificates represent do not constitute purchased power and the renewable energy certificate costs cannot be recovered through the automatic adjustment clause.N.M. Indus. Energy Consumers v. N.M. PRC, 2007-NMSC-053, 142 N.M. 533, 168 P.3d 105.\n\nThe commission exceeded its authoritywhen it determined that renewable energy certificates costs were closely related to purchased power and recoverable through the automatic adjustment clause.N.M. Indus. Energy Consumers v. N.M. PRC, 2007-NMSC-053, 142 N.M. 533, 168 P.3d 105.\n\nThe public regulation commission did not exceed its authority in setting a just and reasonable rate for a rural electric cooperative.— Where appellant, a public utility and rural electric cooperative organized under the Rural Electric Cooperative Act, 62-15-1 to 62-15-37 NMSA 1978, appealed from an order of the New Mexico public regulation commission (commission) rejecting rates proposed by the rural electric cooperative and directing the rural electric cooperative to adopt rates which the commission determined to be just and reasonable, arguing that the commission exceeded its authority because it had no power to fix different rates for a rural electric cooperative but could only approve or deny the rates as proposed, the commission did not exceed the scope of its authority, because the legislature has expressly recognized that the commission may regulate a rural electric cooperative's rates and that the regulation of these rates is a matter of public concern, and once the commission's jurisdiction under 62-8-7(H) NMSA 1978 was invoked, the commission had plenary authority to determine whether a cooperative's proposed rates were just and reasonable, and if the commission finds those rates are unreasonable, then the commission has the authority to fix just and reasonable rates for that cooperative.Socorro Elec. v. N.M. Pub. Regul. Comm'n, 2024-NMSC-017.\n\nThe public regulation commission's decision to reject rural electric cooperative's proposed revenue requirement was lawful, reasonable, and supported by substantial evidence.— Where appellant, a public utility and rural electric cooperative organized under the Rural Electric Cooperative Act, 62-15-1 to 62-15-37 NMSA 1978, appealed from an order of the New Mexico public regulation commission (commission) rejecting a rate increase proposed by the rural electric cooperative and directing the rural electric cooperative to adopt rates which the commission determined to be just and reasonable, arguing that the commission's decision to deny its proposed revenue increase attempted to set financial objectives for the rural electric cooperative, appellant's argument was without merit, because the commission did not set financial objectives for the rural electric cooperative by rejecting its proposed revenue requirement, but rather denied the rural electric cooperative's proposed rates because it determined, based on exhibits and expert testimony in the record, that the rates were not just and reasonable and that the cooperative had not shown a need for increased revenue. The just and reasonable standard of the Public Utility Act requires rates to be neither unreasonably high so as to unjustly burden ratepayers with excessive rates nor unreasonably low so as to constitute a taking of property without just compensation or a violation of due process by preventing the utility from earning a reasonable rate of return on its investment.Socorro Elec. v. N.M. Pub. Regul. Comm'n, 2024-NMSC-017.\n\nThe public regulation commission's revenue reallocation and rate design decisions were lawful, reasonable, and supported by substantial evidence.— Where appellant, a public utility and rural electric cooperative organized under the Rural Electric Cooperative Act, 62-15-1 to 62-15-37 NMSA 1978, appealed from an order of the New Mexico public regulation commission (commission) rejecting a rate increase proposed by the rural electric cooperative, directing the rural electric cooperative to adopt rates which the commission determined to be just and reasonable and ordering the rural electric cooperative to make several adjustments to its proposed rate design, arguing that the commission's order to reallocate revenues and redesign the cooperative's rates was unlawful because the commission had no power to direct the rural electric cooperative to adopt a different allocation or design but was limited to approving or denying the allocation and design as proposed, the commission's revenue reallocation was not unlawful, arbitrary or capricious, because revenue allocation and rate design are public matters, and once the commission's jurisdiction under 62-8-7(H) NMSA 1978 was invoked, the commission had considerable discretion in the area of rate design, and appellant has not shown that the commission's reallocation and design decisions were arbitrary or capricious.Socorro Elec. v. N.M. Pub. Regul. Comm'n, 2024-NMSC-017.\n\nRate requests carried out under this section.— This section is the provision under which the overall purpose of Section 62-8-1 NMSA 1978 is carried out for the given instance of a rate request.Otero Cnty.

Comm'n, 1989-NMSC-033, 108 N.M. 462, 774 P.2d 1050.\n\nCommission is vested with considerable discretionin determining whether a rate to be received and charged is just and reasonable.Hobbs Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv.

Comm'n, 1989-NMSC-033, 108 N.M. 462, 774 P.2d 1050.\n\nCommission may change rates by unilateral action followed by hearing.— This section contains express language conferring power on the commission, by unilateral action, to make a change in rates, providing hearing on what is a fair and reasonable rate follows in due season on proper notice and an opportunity is made for all interested parties to be heard.Potash Co. of Am. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1956-NMSC-091, 62 N.M. 1, 303 P.2d 908.\n\nIncluding increase in contract rate.— Where the commission had entered an order authorizing a public utility to enter into a contract and to continue to charge the gas rate therein specified until further order and on the ex parte petition of the utility subsequently entered an interlocutory order making a rate increase to be effective until the commission could hold a hearing to determine and set a new and proper rate, the commission was moving strictly in conformity with the act creating it to determine one of the major questions submitted to its jurisdiction - a question of rates.Potash Co. of Am. v.

Comm'n, 1970-NMSC-097, 81 N.M. 683, 472 P.2d 648.\n\nCommission's order held unsupported by substantial evidence.— Where gas company seeking rate increase proposed to trend the general plant account items by using a nationally recognized index, but the commission instead inserted its own method - to simply use the untrended original cost, although the witness who strongly supported this approach admitted that he did not know whether this would accurately establish the reproduction cost of the items, the court held the commission's order was unreasonable, being unsupported by substantial evidence.Southern Union Gas Co. v.

In all other respects, Section 62-8-7 NMSA 1978 shall apply to such water utilities. If a utility provides both water and sewer service, the service connection revenues attributable to the provision of water service only shall determine whether the procedures specified in this subsection shall apply to a schedule proposing new rates for water service, and the service connection revenues attributable to the provision of sewer service shall determine whether the procedures specified in this subsection shall apply to a schedule proposing new rates for sewer service.

The increased rates shall not become effective until at least thirty days after notice and filing with the commission. If a public utility provides both water and sewer service, the service connection revenues attributable to the provision of water service only shall determine whether the procedure specified in this subsection shall apply to any schedule proposing any new rate or rates for water service, and the service connection revenues attributable to the provision of sewer service shall determine whether the procedures specified in this subsection shall apply to any schedule proposing any new rate or rates for sewer service.

That sum shall be payable on or before the first day of April in each year. An inspection and supervision fee shall be paid by utilities in addition to all property, franchise, license, intangible and other taxes, fees and charges provided by law. No similar inspection and supervision fee shall be measured by the amount of the gross receipts of such utility for the calendar year next preceding the date fixed in this section for the payment of the fee. In the case of utilities engaged in interstate business, the inspection and supervision fee shall be measured by the gross receipts of those utilities from intrastate business only for that preceding calendar year and not in any respect upon receipts derived wholly or in part from interstate business. No inspection and supervision fee shall be charged on the gross receipts from the sale of gas, water or electricity to a utility regulated by the commission for resale to the public.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 68-6-8, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 96, § 6; 1992, ch. 22, § 1; 2003, ch. 14, § 21; 2005, ch. 339, § 5.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1967, ch. 96, § 6, repealed 68-6-8, 1953 Comp., relating to inspection and supervision fees, and enacted the above section.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective July 1, 2005, changed the date the sum is payable from the last day of February to the first day of April.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, substituted \"fee\" for \"fees\" in the section heading, in the first sentence, substituted \"five hundred six thousandths\" for \"one-half of one\" following \"an amount equal to\", deleted \"In calendar year 1992, that sum shall be payable in equal quarterly installments on or before the last day of February, May, August and November, respectively.

Water Util. Auth. v. NMPRC, 2010-NMSC-013, 148 N.M. 21, 229 P.3d 494.\n\nFees permitted for prior year's services.— The commission has authority to assess and collect inspection and supervision fees for the preceding year, despite the fact that, during the year the fees are actually assessed and become payable, the utility is no longer doing business in New Mexico.United Waterworks, Inc. v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 2000-NMCA-057, 129 N.M. 262, 5 P.3d 584.\n\nLegislative intent is that fees collected go to the state,not to any specific fund. Once deposited with the state, in the general fund, they may be appropriated by the legislature as it sees fit. Thus, the commission is only entitled for its operation to such money generated by the fees collected pursuant to this section as the legislature may appropriate. The commission may not expend the entire amount received. 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-10.\n\nFee calculated at beginning of year based on past year's receipts.— Under this section the fee to be paid in any given year is calculated at the beginning of the year on the basis of gross receipts for the past year. It is only the payment of the fee which is permitted to be spread throughout the year. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-96.\n\nWhere utility operates only for part of a year,it is liable for the full annual fee. 1943 Op. Att'y Gen.

When considering applications for approval, the commission shall review the reasonableness of a proposed grid modernization project and as part of that review shall consider whether the requested investments, incentives, programs and expenditures are:\n\n(1) reasonably expected to improve the public utility's electrical system efficiency, reliability, resilience and security; maintain reasonable operations, maintenance and ratepayer costs; and meet energy demands through a flexible, diversified and distributed energy portfolio, including energy standards established in Section 62-16-4 NMSA 1978;\n\n(2) designed to support connection of New Mexico's electrical grid into regional energy markets and increase New Mexico's capability to supply regional energy needs through export of clean and renewable electricity;\n\n(3) reasonably expected to increase access to and use of clean and renewable energy, with consideration given for increasing access to low-income users and users in underserved communities;\n\n(4) designed to contribute to the reduction of air pollution, including greenhouse gases;\n\n(5) reasonably expected to support increased product and program offerings by utilities to their customers; allow for private capital investments and skilled jobs in related services; and provide customer protection, information or education;\n\n(6) transparent, incorporating public reporting requirements to inform project design and commission policy; and\n\n(7) otherwise consistent with the state's grid modernization planning process and priorities.\n\nC. Except as provided in Subsection D of this section, a public utility that undertakes grid modernization projects approved by the commission may recover its reasonable costs through an approved tariff rider or in base rates, or by a combination of the two. Costs that are no greater than the amount approved by the commission for a utility grid modernization project are presumed to be reasonable. A tariff rider proposed by a public utility to fund approved grid modernization projects shall go into effect thirty days after filing, unless suspended by the commission for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty days. If the tariff rider is not approved or suspended within thirty days after filing, it shall be deemed approved as a matter of law. If the commission has not acted to approve or disapprove the tariff rider by the end of the suspension period, it shall be deemed approved as a matter of law.\n\nD. Costs for a grid modernization project that only benefits customers of an electric distribution system shall not be recovered from customers served at a level of one hundred ten thousand volts or higher from an electric transmission system in New Mexico.\n\nE. The provisions of this section do not apply to a distribution cooperative organized pursuant to the Rural Electric Cooperative Act [Chapter 62, Article 15 NMSA 1978].\n\nF. As used in this section, \"grid modernization\" means improvements to electric distribution or transmission infrastructure through investments in assets, technologies or services that are designed to modernize the electrical system by enhancing electric distribution or transmission grid reliability, resilience, interconnection of distributed energy resources, distribution system efficiency, grid security against cyber and physical threats, customer service or energy efficiency and conservation and includes:\n\n(1) advanced metering infrastructure and associated communications networks;\n\n(2) intelligent grid devices for real time or near-real time system and asset information;\n\n(3) automated control systems for electric transmission and distribution circuits and substations;\n\n(4) high-speed, low-latency communications networks for grid device data exchange and remote and automated control of devices;\n\n(5) distribution system hardening projects for circuits and substations designed to reduce service outages or service restoration times, but does not include the conversion of overhead tap lines to underground service;\n\n(6) physical security measures at critical distribution substations;\n\n(7) cybersecurity measures;\n\n(8) systems or technologies that enhance or improve distribution system planning capabilities by the public utility;\n\n(9) technologies to enable demand response;\n\n(10) energy storage systems and microgrids that support circuit-level grid stability, power quality, reliability or resiliency or provide temporary backup energy supply;\n\n(11) infrastructure and equipment necessary to support electric vehicle charging or the electrification of community infrastructure or industrial production, processing, or transportation; and\n\n(12) new customer information platforms designed to provide improved customer access, greater service options and expanded access to energy usage information.\n\nHistory:Laws 2020, ch. 15, § 3; 2021, ch. 110, § 1.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective April 6, 2021, clarified that grid modernization projects may include distribution system hardening projects for circuits and substations designed to reduce service outages or service restoration times, but does not include the conversion of overhead tap lines to underground service; in Subsection F, Paragraph F(5), after \"projects for circuits\", deleted \"not including the conversion of overhead tap lines to underground service\", and after \"restoration times\", added \"but does not include the conversion of overhead tap lines to underground service\".",
