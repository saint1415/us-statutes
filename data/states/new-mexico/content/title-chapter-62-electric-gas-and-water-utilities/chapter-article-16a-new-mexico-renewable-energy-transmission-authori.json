      "text": "A. The \"New Mexico renewable energy transmission authority\" is created as a public body, politic and corporate, separate and apart from the state, constituting a governmental instrumentality for the performance of essential public functions.\n\nB. The authority shall be composed of six members as follows:\n\n(1) three members appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate. The initial appointees shall be appointed for staggered terms of one, two and three years; thereafter, the members shall be appointed for three-year terms;\n\n(2) the state treasurer or the state treasurer's designee;\n\n(3) one member appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives who shall serve at the pleasure of the speaker of the house; and\n\n(4) one member appointed by the president pro tempore of the senate who shall serve at the pleasure of the president pro tempore.\n\nC. The qualifications of the members shall be as follows:\n\n(1) one member appointed by the governor shall have expertise in financial matters involving the financing of major electrical transmission projects;\n\n(2) the other four appointed members shall have:\n\n(a) special knowledge of the public utility industry, as evidenced by college degrees or by experience, at least five years of which must be with the public utility industry; and\n\n(b) knowledge of renewable energy development; and\n\n(3) no member shall represent a person that owns or operates facilities.\n\nD. The members initially appointed by the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate shall, by lot, determine one to have an initial term of two years and one to have an initial term of four years; thereafter, the appointments will be for staggered terms of four years.\n\nE. In addition to the six voting members, the secretary of energy, minerals and natural resources shall serve as an ex-officio nonvoting member of the authority.\n\nF. The governor shall designate an appointed member of the authority to serve as chair, and the authority may elect annually such other officers as it deems necessary.\n\nG. The authority shall meet at the call of the chair or whenever four members shall so request in writing. A majority of members then serving constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business, but the affirmative vote of at least four members is necessary for any action to be taken by the authority.\n\nH. The authority is not created or organized, and its operations are not conducted, for the purpose of making a profit, but it is expected to recover the costs of operating the authority. No part of the revenues or assets of the authority shall benefit or be distributable to its members, officers or other private persons. The members of the authority shall receive no compensation for their services, but the public members shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses at the same rate and on the same basis as provided for public officers in the Per Diem and Mileage Act [10-8-1 to 10-8-8 NMSA 1978].\n\nI. The authority is not subject to the supervision or control of any other board, bureau, department or agency of the state except as specifically provided in the New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority Act. No use of the terms \"state agency\" or \"instrumentality\" in any other law of the state shall be deemed to refer to the authority unless the authority is specifically referred to in the law.\n\nJ. The authority is a governmental instrumentality for purposes of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 to 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:Laws 2007, ch. 3, § 3; 2011, ch. 51, § 4.\n\nThe 2011 amendment,effective July 1, 2011, decreased the number of members of the board from seven to six and removed the state investment officer as a member of the authority.",

Before entering into a project, the following procedures shall be implemented:\n\n(1) the authority shall provide to each public utility and the public regulation commission and publish one time in a newspaper of general circulation in New Mexico and one time in a newspaper in the area where the eligible facilities are contemplated and on a publicly accessible web page maintained by the authority, an initial notice describing the project that the authority is contemplating, including a detailed description of the existing or anticipated renewable energy sources that justify the determination by the authority that the project facilities are eligible facilities. The description shall contain, at a minimum, the names of all persons that already are or will develop the renewable energy sources, all persons that will own the renewable energy sources and the peak output capacity, source type, location and anticipated connection date of the renewable energy sources;\n\n(2) any person with an interest that may be affected by the proposed project shall have thirty days from the date of the last publication of the initial notice to challenge, in writing, the determination by the authority that the facilities are eligible facilities. If a challenge is received by the authority within the thirty days, the authority shall hold a public hearing no sooner than thirty days after receiving the challenge and after a minimum of two weeks notice in the same newspapers and web page in which the initial notice was given. Following the public hearing, the authority shall make a final determination of eligibility and give notice of the determination pursuant to Section 39-3-1.1 NMSA 1978.

In soliciting and entering into contracts for the transmission or storage of electricity, the authority and any person leasing or operating eligible facilities financed or acquired by the authority shall, if practical, give priority to those contracts that will transmit or store electricity to be sold and consumed in New Mexico.\n\nE. The authority and any eligible facilities acquired by the authority are not subject to the supervision, regulation, control or jurisdiction of the public regulation commission; provided that nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to allow a public utility to include the cost of using eligible facilities in its rate base without the approval of the public regulation commission.\n\nF.

A public utility subject to regulation of the public regulation commission pursuant to the Public Utility Act [Chapter 62, Articles 1 to 6 and 8 to 13 NMSA 1978] may recover the capital cost of a project undertaken pursuant to the New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority Act from its retail customers only if the project has received a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the public regulation commission. A municipal utility exempt from regulation of the public regulation commission may recover such costs only if the project has been approved by the governing body of the municipality. Costs associated with a project undertaken pursuant to the New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority Act are not recoverable from retail utility customers except to the extent the costs are prudently incurred and the project is used and useful in serving those customers as determined by the public regulation commission.\n\nHistory:Laws 2007, ch. 3, § 4.\n\nEffective date.— Laws 2007, ch. 3, § 19 made Laws 2007, ch. 3, § 4 effective July 1, 2007.",

The state does hereby pledge that the renewable energy transmission bonding fund, including any separate account within the fund, shall be used only for the purposes specified in this section and pledged first to pay the debt service on the bonds issued pursuant to the New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority Act.
