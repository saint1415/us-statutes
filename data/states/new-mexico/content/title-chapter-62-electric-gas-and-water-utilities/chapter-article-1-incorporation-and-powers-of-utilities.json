Ruidoso Tel. Co., 1948-NMSC-067, 52 N.M. 415, 200 P.2d 713.\n\nTown need accept only works actually constructed or started under county franchise.— In order to compel a town, incorporated after the granting of a franchise by the county commissioners, to accept such franchise, it was necessary that the holder of the franchise had erected or constructed, or in good faith commenced, the erection or construction of the works.Village of Hobbs v.

No. 73-26.\n\nCounty may not impose fees or rental charges.— There is no statutory authority for a county to impose fees or rental charges on a utility holding a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the public service commission (now public regulation commission) for use of rights-of-way of county roads. 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-26.\n\nCity need not recognize franchise without construction in annexed territory.— A city is not bound by law to recognize the county franchise issued to a private company to operate in territories which have subsequently been annexed by the city, in which territories no construction of utility facilities has been commenced. 1964 Op.

When it is necessary for a corporation to construct any transmission line and associated facilities for the transmission of electrical power requiring a width for right-of-way of greater than one hundred feet, unless that width is agreed to by the parties, the applicant for the right-of-way shall apply to the New Mexico public utility commission as provided in Section 62-9-3.2 NMSA 1978 for a determination of the width necessary for the right-of-way for the transmission line.\n\nB. For the purposes of this section, \"corporation\" means individuals, firms, partnerships, companies, municipalities, rural electric cooperatives organized under Laws 1937, Chapter 100 or the Rural Electric Cooperative Act [Chapter 62, Article 15 NMSA 1978], lessees, trustees or receivers appointed by any court.\n\nHistory:Laws 1909, ch. 141, § 4; Code 1915, § 1024; C.S. 1929, § 32-404; 1941 Comp., § 72-104; 1953 Comp., § 68-1-4; Laws 1980, ch. 20, § 17; 1993, ch. 282, § 19.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 1937, ch. 100, referred to in Subsection B, was repealed by Laws 1939, ch. 47, § 34.\n\nSections 62-1-1 to 62-1-7 of the Public Utility Act are still effective as the repeal of Chapter 62, Article 1 by Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, effective July 1, 2003 was repealed prior to taking effect by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003. Although Laws 2003, Chapter 336, Section 8, amended Laws 1998, Chapter 82, as amended, an amendment of a repealed section is ineffective.SeeQuintana v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 100 N.M. 224, 668 P.2d 1101 (1983). Laws 2003, Chapter 416, Section 5 also repealed Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, as amended, a second time, however, that repeal is of no effect as the section had previously been repealed by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.\n\nCross references.— For eminent domain proceedings,seeChapter 42A, NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, in Subsection A, substituted \"corporation\" and \"right-of-way\" for references to \"they\" and \"the same\", substituted \"New Mexico public utility commission\" for \"public service commission\" and made stylistic changes throughout the subsection; and deleted \"whatsoever\" at the end of Subsection B.\n\nEminent domain matter of public policy.— The granting of the power of eminent domain, and the parameters thereto, is a matter of public policy for the legislature's determination.El Paso Elec. Co. v. Real Estate Mart, Inc., 1979-NMSC-023, 92 N.M. 581, 592 P.2d 181.\n\nSection authorizes entry by utility.— This section authorizes utility to enter land to survey and to appropriate land for the erection of power lines.Zobel v. Public Serv. Co., 1965-NMSC-021, 75 N.M. 22, 399 P.2d 922.\n\nRegardless of validity of utilities easement.— That electric power utility may have entered onto premises under an easement which landowners alleged was invalid would not make unlawful utility's entry onto premises pursuant to statute granting public utilities such right of entry.Garver v. Public Serv. Co., 1966-NMSC-261, 77 N.M. 262, 421 P.2d 788.\n\nRight to damages in inverse condemnation.— This section gives the right to recover damages in inverse condemnation.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. W.S. Ranch Co., 1970-NMSC-043, 81 N.M. 414, 467 P.2d 986.\n\nAuthorized foreign public utility may exercise eminent domain.— Under Sections 53-17-2 and 62-1-1 NMSA 1978 and this section, a foreign public utility authorized to do business in this state has the same right as a domestic public utility to exercise the power of eminent domain in this state.El Paso Elec. Co. v. Real Estate Mart, Inc., 1979-NMSC-023, 92 N.M. 581, 592 P.2d 181.\n\nSupervision of foreign public utilities.— Foreign public utilities authorized to do business in this state are subject to the same supervision as utilities incorporated under the laws of this state.El Paso Elec. Co. v. Real Estate Mart, Inc., 1979-NMSC-023, 92 N.M. 581, 592 P.2d 181.\n\nAuthorized condemnor may be liable in trespass.— An authorized condemnor may be liable in trespass to a property owner for taking more land than is reasonably necessary or for causing excessive damage by the manner in which the taking occurs, but only when there is evidence of fraud, bad faith or gross abuse of discretion.North v. Public Serv. Co., 1983-NMCA-124, 101 N.M. 222, 680 P.2d 603, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 11, 677 P.2d 624.\n\nDamages for trespass when authorized condemnor is liablecover only that portion of the damage over and above what results from the taking itself.North v. Public Serv. Co., 1983-NMCA-124, 101 N.M. 222, 680 P.2d 603, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 11, 677 P.2d 624.\n\nProcedure for compensation for prior entry is exclusive.— In those jurisdictions in which there may be a constitutional taking of property by virtue of an exercise of the power of eminent domain prior to the payment of compensation, such procedure is justified by reason of legislative provision for an adequate method of obtaining just compensation by the owner. Under such circumstances the statutory remedy is deemed exclusive, and the owner is prevented from asserting the ordinary common-law actions arising from interference with his title or possession.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. W.S. Ranch Co., 1970-NMSC-043, 81 N.M. 414, 467 P.2d 986.\n\nLandowner cannot assert common-law action for damages.Zobel v. Pub. Serv. Co., 1965-NMSC-021, 75 N.M. 22, 399 P.2d 922.\n\nTrespass lies where there is no right to condemn.— Where parties are mistaken in their belief that they had the right to condemn, a trespass action would be proper.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. W.S. Ranch Co., 1970-NMSC-043, 81 N.M. 414, 467 P.2d 986.\n\nWhen consequential damages permitted.— Where a utility takes possession of property and grades roads outside the 100-foot easement allowed by Section 62-1-4 NMSA 1978, the condemnees are entitled to consequential damages if they can prove that the value of their property depreciated by reason of the entry and grading.El Paso Elec. v. Real Estate Mart, Inc., 1982-NMCA-101, 98 N.M. 490, 650 P.2d 12, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 590, 651 P.2d 636.\n\nStipulation as to power of court to award damages held binding.— Stipulation is binding on the parties and properly given effect on remand where it was agreed that if a gas utility seeking to enjoin erection of a dwelling over its main line was found not to have a prescriptive easement, evidence of damages for the line crossing defendant's property would be considered by the court.Southern Union Gas Co. v. Cantrell, 1953-NMSC-092, 57 N.M. 612, 261 P.2d 645.\n\nCondemnees may appeal although warrants have been issued to attorneys.— Where the clerk issued warrants to attorneys for condemnees for amounts of awards in eminent domain, but these warrants were not delivered to or endorsed by condemnees and funds that were deposited with clerk remained in hands of clerk, condemnees had not received benefit from judgment and were not barred from appealing judgment.AT & T Co. v. Walker, 1967-NMSC-049, 77 N.M. 755, 427 P.2d 267.\n\nAs to right to trial by jury, and waiver thereof.El Paso Elec. v.
