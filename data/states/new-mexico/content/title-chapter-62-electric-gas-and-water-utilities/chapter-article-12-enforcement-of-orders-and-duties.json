The attorney general of New Mexico shall thereupon begin such action or proceeding by petition to such court, alleging the violation or threatened violation complained of, and praying for appropriate relief by way of mandamus or injunction. It shall thereupon be the duty of the court to specify a time, not exceeding thirty days after the service of the copy of the petition, within which the public utility or person complained of must plead, and in the meantime said public utility or person may for good cause shown be restrained. In case of default, the court shall immediately inquire into the facts and circumstances of the case. Such corporations or persons as the court may deem necessary or proper to be joined as parties, in order to make its judgment, order or writ effective, may be joined as parties. The final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall either dismiss the action or proceeding or direct that the writ of mandamus or injunction issue or be made permanent as prayed for in the petition, or in such modified or other form as will afford appropriate relief. An appeal may be taken as in other civil actions.\n\nHistory:Laws 1941, ch. 84, § 73; 1941 Comp., § 72-1001; 1953 Comp., § 68-10-1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— For the meaning of \"this act\",see62-13-1 NMSA 1978 and notes thereto.\n\nSections 62-12-1 to 62-12-7 of the Public Utility Act are still effective as the repeal of Chapter 62, Article 12 by Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, effective July 1, 2003 Chapter 108, Section 82 was repealed prior to taking effect by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.

Consent of the state is hereby expressly given to the maintenance of such suits against said commission. Any such action shall be brought against said commission in the district court of Santa Fe county, New Mexico, or in the district court of the county in which the complaint or controversy arose.

Comm'n, 1956-NMSC-091, 62 N.M. 1, 303 P.2d 908.\n\nIncreasing contract rate is not in excess of commission's jurisdiction.— Where the commission had entered an order authorizing a public utility to enter into a contract and to continue to charge the gas rate therein specified until further order and on the ex parte petition of the utility subsequently entered an interlocutory order making a rate increase to be effective until the commission could hold a hearing to determine and set a new and proper rate, the commission was moving strictly in conformity with the act creating it to determine one of the major questions submitted to its jurisdiction - a question of rates.Potash Co. of Am. v.
