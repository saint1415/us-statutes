      "text": "A. Public utilities, as defined in Section 62-3-3 NMSA 1978, are affected with the public interest in that, among other things:\n\n(1) a substantial portion of public utilities' business and activities involves the rendition of essential public services to a large number of the general public;\n\n(2) public utilities' financing involves the investment of large sums of money, including capital obtained from many members of the general public; and\n\n(3) the development and extension of public utilities' business directly affects the development, growth and expansion of the general welfare, business and industry of the state.\n\nB. It is the declared policy of the state that the public interest, the interest of consumers and the interest of investors require the regulation and supervision of public utilities to the end that reasonable and proper services shall be available at fair, just and reasonable rates and to the end that capital and investment may be encouraged and attracted so as to provide for the construction, development and extension, without unnecessary duplication and economic waste, of proper plants and facilities and demand-side resources for the rendition of service to the general public and to industry.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 68-3-1, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 96, § 2; 2008, ch. 24, § 1.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1967, ch. 96, § 2, repealed former 68-3-1, 1953 Comp., relating to declaration of policy, and enacted a new section.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Sections 62-3-1 to 62-3-5 of the Public Utility Act are still effective as the repeal of Chapter 62, Article 3 by Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, effective July 1, 2003 was repealed prior to taking effect by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003. Although Laws 2003, Chapter 336, Section 8, amended Laws 1998, Chapter 82, as amended, an amendment of a repealed section is ineffective.SeeQuintana v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 100 N.M. 224, 668 P.2d 1101 (1983). Laws 2003, Chapter 416, Section 5 also repealed Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, as amended, a second time, however, that repeal is of no effect as the section had previously been repealed by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.\n\nThe 2008 amendment,effective May 14, 2008, in Subsection B, provided that capital and investment should provide for demand-side resources.\n\nTelecommunications.— The Public Utilities Act does not apply to telecommunication services.In re Qwest Communications Int'l, Inc., 2002-NMSC-006, 131 N.M. 770, 42 P.3d 1219.\n\nPublic regulation commission derives its authority and jurisdictionfrom the New Mexico Public Utility Act.City of Sunland Park v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2004-NMCA-024, 135 N.M. 143, 85 P.3d 267, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-002, 135 N.M. 169, 86 P.3d 47.\n\nGoals of utility regulation have been established.— The legislature has established certain goals which utility regulation and supervision are intended to achieve: reasonable and proper services should be made available to the public at fair, just and reasonable rates, and capital and investment should be encouraged and attracted for the plants and facilities which are to render that service.Southern Union Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1972-NMSC-072, 84 N.M. 330, 503 P.2d 310.\n\nUtilities excluded from commission's jurisdiction.— Absent a regulatory provision stating otherwise, or absent a willingness of the utility to serve \"an indefinite public,\" any utilities not expressly brought within the scope of The Public Utility Act are excluded from the commission's jurisdiction.Morningstar Water Users Ass'n v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 1995-NMSC-062, 120 N.M. 579, 904 P.2d 28.\n\nSection lists some, but not all, points of public interest.— A preamble is a declaration by the legislature of the reasons for the passage of the statute and is helpful in the interpretation of any ambiguities within the statute to which it is prefixed; however, the points of public interest in this section are not the only ones contemplated by the legislature.Griffith v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1974-NMSC-024, 86 N.M. 113, 520 P.2d 269.\n\nSupervision of foreign public utilities.— Foreign public utilities authorized to do business in this state are subject to the same supervision as utilities incorporated under the laws of this state.El Paso Elec. Co. v. Real Estate Mart, Inc., 1979-NMSC-023, 92 N.M. 581, 592 P.2d 181.\n\nPublic service commission's (now public regulation commission's) powers only come from statute.— The public service commission (now public regulation commission) is an administrative body created by statute and must therefore find its authority and jurisdiction conferred upon it either expressly or by necessary implication from the same statutory authority.N.M. Elec. Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1970-NMSC-097, 81 N.M. 683, 472 P.2d 648.\n\nCommission may not distinguish between forms of ownership in rate-making.— The New Mexico legislature has made no distinction between public utilities operated as individuals, firms, partnerships, companies or corporations. Nowhere in the New Mexico Public Utility Act is the commission given authority, for the purpose of rate-making, to make a distinction between a public utility operated as a corporation from one operated as a sole proprietorship.Moyston v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1966-NMSC-062, 76 N.M. 146, 412 P.2d 840.\n\nOrder that refund be passed on to consumers.— Public service commission (now public regulation commission) has no express or implied statutory authority to order the flow-through of refunds to electric company from power supplier to consumers.N.M. Elec. Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1970-NMSC-097, 81 N.M. 683, 472 P.2d 648.\n\nWhere refund was not trust fund for consumers.— Where refund was ordered paid over to power company by the federal power commission without any restrictions, and there was nothing in the order indicating an intention on the part of the commission to create a \"trust fund\" for the benefit of the ultimate consumers, the refund did not constitute a trust fund belonging to company's customers.N.M. Elec. Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1970-NMSC-097, 81 N.M. 683, 472 P.2d 648.\n\nCharitable contributions and lobbying expenditures not passable to consumers.— A commission order which essentially prohibited utility companies from including charitable contributions and lobbying expenditures in their cost of service, and from thereby passing those expenses on to the ratepayers was a reasonable exercise of the commission's authority pursuant to Subsection B.El Paso Elec. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1985-NMSC-085, 103 N.M. 300, 706 P.2d 511.\n\nAdvertising costs passable to consumers.— A commission order which allowed utility companies to include in their cost of service, and pass on to their ratepayers, expenditures for \"informational\" advertising (e.g., safety, billing practices, etc.), but not expenditures for \"institutional\" advertising (e.g., enhancement of corporate image), and which required that a utility show by \"clear and convincing\" evidence that an advertising expense is allowable was a reasonable exercise of the commission's authority pursuant to Subsection B, to insure that utility services are available \"at fair, just and reasonable rates.\"El Paso Elec. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1985-NMSC-085, 103 N.M. 300, 706 P.2d 511.\n\nRate increases to compensate predecessor utility for expenses.— The public service commission (now public regulation commission) did not have jurisdiction over rate increases requested by a natural gas distribution company to compensate the company's predecessor, which was not currently a public utility, for expenses incurred by the latter in fulfilling its function as a public utility.Southern Union Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 1997-NMSC-056, 124 N.M. 176, 947 P.2d 133.\n\nLowering gas rate to reimburse for overpayment is subject to bankruptcy stay provisions.— Lowering of gas rate to reimburse customers for previous overpayments is not a rate setting function of the public service commission and, as such, was subject to bankruptcy stay provisions.In re Jal Gas Co., 44 B.R. 91 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1984).\n\nFinancial affairs of public utilities are strictly regulated.— It is the public policy of the state to require strict regulation of the financial affairs of public utilities, to the end that they may be adequately financed and, among other things, render service at reasonable rates.Hogue v. Superior Utils., Inc., 1949-NMSC-056, 53 N.M. 452, 210 P.2d 938 (1949).\n\nBoth ratepayers and investors must be justly treated.— In the determining of a proper rate of return under the statute, enough actual dollars must be produced that both ratepayers and investors are justly and reasonably treated.Southern Union Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1972-NMSC-072, 84 N.M. 330, 503 P.2d 310.\n\nCommission is vested with considerable discretionin determining whether a rate to be received and charged is just and reasonable.Hobbs Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1980-NMSC-005, 94 N.M. 731, 616 P.2d 1116.\n\nCommission not limited in factors to be considered in setting rates.— Neither New Mexico case law nor the Public Utility Act imposes any one particular method of valuation upon the commission in ascertaining the rate base of a utility; nor does the spirit of the statute tie the commission down to the consideration of a single factor in establishing rates.Hobbs Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1980-NMSC-005, 94 N.M. 731, 616 P.2d 1116.\n\nCommission must consider income taxes in fixing rates.— Rates which failed entirely to take federal and state income taxes to which unincorporated utility's operations had been subjected into account as operating expenses are unfair, unjust, unreasonable and discriminatory, and an amount equal to the tax the utility would pay, if incorporated, was a reasonable and realistic amount to be deducted from the utility's taxable income for rate-making purposes.Moyston v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1966-NMSC-062, 76 N.M. 146, 412 P.2d 840.\n\nEvidence must show rate fixed is reasonable and will achieve goals.— District court's holding below that commission's order was unreasonable and unlawful because it did not simply turn the cost of capital percentage directly into a rate of return was upheld by supreme court because it found there was little or no evidence that the particular rate chosen by the commission would achieve the statutory goals and therefore was unreasonable.Southern Union Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1972-NMSC-072, 84 N.M. 330, 503 P.2d 310.\n\nValuation methods must be supported by substantial evidence.— Where gas company seeking rate increase proposed to trend the general plant account items by using a nationally recognized index, but the commission instead inserted its own method - to simply use the untrended original cost, although the witness who strongly supported this approach admitted that he did not know whether this would accurately establish the reproduction cost of the items, the court held the commission's order was unreasonable, being unsupported by substantial evidence.Southern Union Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1972-NMSC-072, 84 N.M. 330, 503 P.2d 310.\n\nCommission may not remove entire construction item because interest was included.— The district court erred in failing to hold unreasonable and unlawful the commission's removal of $673,574 of construction work in progress from the company's rate base on the reasoning that it had included the interest on that amount, $4904.62, when the object was to determine accurately the value of the company's property.Southern Union Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1972-NMSC-072, 84 N.M. 330, 503 P.2d 310.\n\nUtility cannot contract against its negligence in performing duties.— A public service corporation, or a public utility such as an electric company, cannot contract against its negligence in the regular course of its business or in performing one of its duties of public service or where a public duty is owed or where public interest is involved.Southwestern Pub. Serv. Co. v. Artesia Alfalfa Growers' Ass'n, 1960-NMSC-052, 67 N.M. 108, 353 P.2d 62.\n\nRequiring exhaustion of administrative remedies is constitutional.— The requirement of the Public Utility Act that a person first exhaust his administrative remedy before resorting to the courts does not violate N.M. Const., art. VI, § 13, granting general jurisdiction to the district courts except as elsewhere limited in such constitution.Smith v. Southern Union Gas Co., 1954-NMSC-033, 58 N.M. 197, 269 P.2d 745.\n\nProcedure may not be changed arbitrarily.— Although the public service commission (now public regulation commission) should be able to change its procedure, it should not arbitrarily or capriciously do so without good reasons.Southern Union Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1972-NMSC-072, 84 N.M. 330, 503 P.2d 310.\n\nMotion to bring record of previous case before court properly stricken.— It was not error on the part of the district court to strike the commission's motion for an amended praecipe, where this motion would have had the effect of bringing the record of a previous case before the court, and the record of that case was not a part of the record in the instant case.Southern Union Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1972-NMSC-072, 84 N.M. 330, 503 P.2d 310.\n\nIndians on reservation are not subject to regulation.— Indians acquiring gas resources from sources wholly upon Indian reservations within the state of New Mexico are not public utilities subject to regulation by the public service commission (now public regulation commission) of New Mexico. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5690.\n\nIndians operating a gas distribution system wholly on an Indian reservation regardless of the manner in which they acquire the gas on the reservation are not subject to the laws of the state of New Mexico in relation to regulation as public utilities. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5690.\n\nSelling television signals does not require certificate.— There does not exist any requirement that a business, consisting of sale of television transmission signals, obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from either the public service commission (now public regulation commission) of New Mexico or the corporation commission (now public regulation commission) of New Mexico before commencing to do business. 1954 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 54-5942.\n\nIndividual selling water to municipal utility is regulated utility.— An individual operating a water service and selling at wholesale water to a municipally owned utility would be a public utility to the extent this operation effects the public interest and as such would be subject to the jurisdiction of the public service commission (now public regulation commission). 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5715.\n\nGeneral jurisdiction does not cover water and sanitation districts.— The legislature did not intend to place water and sanitation districts under the general jurisdiction of the public service commission (now public regulation commission). 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-56.\n\nCommission is given jurisdiction of water and sanitation district rates.— Water and sanitation districts have not been declared to be subject to the jurisdiction of the public service commission (now public regulation commission) except in the limited area of approving the district board's rates, tolls and charges. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-56.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Regulation of Public Utilities,\" see 10 Nat. Res.

      "text": "A. The following are the objects and purposes of this act.\n\n(1) Experience has proven that electric service by rural electric cooperatives must be furnished under the regulation of the commission in order to effectuate the purposes of both the Rural Electric Cooperative Act [Chapter 62, Article 15 NMSA 1978], as amended, and the Public Utility Act [Chapter 62, Articles 1 to 6 and 8 to 13 NMSA 1978], as amended, and that without extending the coverage of the Public Utility Act, as amended, to rural electric cooperatives, the declared policy of the Public Utility Act, as amended, and the general welfare, business and industry of the state may be frustrated.\n\n(2) It is the declared policy of the state that preservation of the public health, safety and welfare, the interest of consumers and the interest of investor-members require that the construction, development and extension of utility plants and facilities be without unnecessary duplication and economic waste. Experience has proven that this purpose cannot be accomplished without bringing the rural electric cooperatives and persons heretofore recognized as public utilities into parity of treatment with respect to the commission's independent jurisdiction and power to prevent unreasonable interference between proposed and existing plants, lines and systems.\n\n(3) Experience has also proven that rural electric cooperatives are substantially different from investor-owned utilities, particularly relative to setting rates. Under the Rural Electric Cooperative Act, rural electric cooperatives are nonprofit membership corporations whose members have direct control over the cooperative's rates through an elected board of trustees. Generally, consumers of the cooperative's power are members. In contrast, consumers of power from investor-owned utilities have no control over the setting of rates by such utilities which are profit motivated. Experience has proven that the costs to rural electric cooperatives and the public at large in complete government regulation of their rates is greatly disproportionate to the need and benefits of complete rate regulation and interferes with the setting of fair, just and reasonable rates to all utilities. Experience has shown that a rational basis exists to provide procedures for setting rates of rural electric cooperatives different from and more limited than those for setting rates of investor-owned utilities. Without limiting government regulation of rate setting by rural electric cooperatives as provided by Section 62-8-7 NMSA 1978, the declared policy of the Public Utility Act, the provision of reasonable and proper utility services at fair, just and reasonable rates, and the general welfare, business and industry of the state may be frustrated.\n\n(4) It is the intent of the legislature in enacting this statute to bring up to date the laws pertaining to public utilities and rural electric cooperatives so that the rural electric cooperative which is a public utility is subject to reasonable burdens and entitled to reasonable benefits which apply to public utilities generally, to insure more reasonable public regulation and supervision of public utilities, to facilitate the prevention of unnecessary duplication and economic waste between utility systems and to establish a system which will more adequately provide for the development and extension of reasonable and proper utility services at fair, just and reasonable rates. The accomplishment of this intent is necessary and vital to the preservation of the public health, safety and welfare.\n\nB. This act shall be liberally construed to carry out its purposes.\n\nC. Nothing contained in any other act governing the creation and operation of rural electric cooperatives which are public utilities, including Laws 1937, Chapter 100 and the Rural Electric Cooperative Act, as amended, shall be construed to conflict with any duty to which such a utility may be subject or with any benefit to which such a utility may be entitled under the Public Utility Act, as now or hereafter amended. In the event any provision of such other act, including Laws 1937, Chapter 100 or the Rural Electric Cooperative Act, as now or hereafter amended, is held to be repugnant to any provision of the Public Utility Act, as now or hereafter amended, the latter shall be controlling and the former is repealed to the extent of the repugnancy.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 68-3-1.1, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 96, § 9; 1985, ch. 176, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The term \"this act\", referred to in Subsections A and B, first appears in Laws 1985, ch. 176, which is codified at 62-3-2 and 62-8-7 NMSA 1978, but is probably intended to be a reference to the Public Utility Act.\n\nSections 62-3-1 to 62-3-5 of the Public Utility Act are still effective as the repeal of Chapter 62, Article 3 by Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, effective July 1, 2003 was repealed prior to taking effect by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003. Although Laws 2003, Chapter 336, Section 8, amended Laws 1998, Chapter 82, as amended, an amendment of a repealed section is ineffective.SeeQuintana v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs.,, 100 N.M. 224, 668 P.2d 1101 (1983). Laws 2003, Chapter 416, Section 5 also repealed Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, as amended, a second time, however, that repeal is of no effect as the section had previously been repealed by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.\n\nCross references.— For Public Utility Act repealing repugnant provisions of Rural Electric Cooperative Act,see62-15-32 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1985 amendmentdeleted \"hereby declared to be\" following \"The following are\" and \"1967\" following \"purposes of this\" in the introductory paragraph of Subsection A, deleted \"public service\" preceding \"commission\" near the beginning of Subsection A(1), substituted \"this purpose\" for \"such purpose\", \"plants\" for \"plant\" and \"systems\" for \"system\" in the second sentence of Subsection A(2), added present Subsection A(3), renumbered former Subsection A(3) as present Subsection A(4), substituting \"which is a public utility is subject to reasonable burdens and entitled to reasonable benefits which apply to public utilities generally, to insure more reasonable public regulation\" for \"subject to all the burdens and entitled to all the benefits which apply to public utilities generally, to insure more rigid public regulation\" in that subsection, deleted \"1967\" following \"This\" at the beginning of Subsection B, divided the former provisions of Subsection C into two sentences, substituting \"operation of rural electric cooperatives which are public utilities\" for \"operation of public utilities brought under the regulation of the commission by virtue of this 1967 act\" and deleting \"and\" following \"hereafter amended\" in the first sentence and substituting \"is held to be\" for \"shall be held to be\" and deleting \"shall be, and\" following \"former\" and \"hereby\" following \"former is\" in the second sentence of Subsection C.\n\nCooperatives may not be made utilities but excepted from regulations upon others.— Laws 1961, ch. 89 (repealed), insofar as it attempted to place rural electric cooperatives under the Public Utility Act by including them within the definition of \"public utility\" constituted an arbitrary and unreasonable classification in violation of the equal protection clauses because cooperatives were included in the act though not required to render service to the general public and no provision was made for complete regulation of rates charged by them or securities issued by them, whereas other electric utilities had to render service to the public and their rates and financing were completely supervised and controlled.Community Pub. Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1966-NMSC-053, 76 N.M. 314, 414 P.2d 675, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 933, 87 S. Ct. 292, 17 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1966).\n\nFormerly, rural electric cooperatives were not regulated by public utilities commission (now public regulation commission).Socorro Elec. Coop. v. Public Serv. Co., 1959-NMSC-105, 66 N.M. 343, 348 P.2d 88.\n\nCommission may not order that refund be passed on to consumers.— Public service commission (now public regulation commission) has no express or implied statutory authority to order the flow-through of refunds to electric company from power supplier to consumers.N.M. Elec. Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1970-NMSC-097, 81 N.M. 683, 472 P.2d 648.\n\nWhere refund was not trust fund for consumers.— Where refund was ordered paid over to power company by the federal power commission without any restrictions, and there was nothing in the order indicating an intention on the part of the commission to create a \"trust fund\" for the benefit of the ultimate consumers, the refund did not constitute a trust fund belonging to company's customers.N.M. Elec. Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1970-NMSC-097, 81 N.M. 683, 472 P.2d 648.\n\nIt was the intent of the legislature that the Public Utility Act be liberally construed.1969 Op. Att'y Gen.

      "text": "A. The following are declared to be the objects and purposes of this 1985 act. Experience has proven that the costs to ratepayers of small water utilities with annual revenues of less than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) and the public at large in complete government regulation of their rates is greatly disproportionate to the need and benefits of complete rate regulation and interferes with setting of fair, just and reasonable rates to all utilities. A rational basis exists to provide procedures for setting rates of such small water utilities different from and more limited than those for setting rates of other utilities. Without limiting government regulation of rate setting by small water utilities as provided by Section 62-8-7.1 NMSA 1978, the declared policy of the Public Utility Act [Chapter 62, Articles 1 to 6 and 8 to 13 NMSA 1978], as amended, the provision of reasonable and proper utility services at fair, just and reasonable rates, and the general welfare, business and industry of the state may be frustrated.\n\nB. The following are hereby declared to be the objects and purposes of these 1987 amendments to the Public Utility Act. Because small sewer utilities are similar to small water utilities, the costs to ratepayers of small sewer utilities with annual revenues of less than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) and the public at large in complete government regulation of their rates is greatly disproportionate to the need and benefits of complete rate regulation and interferes with setting of fair, just and reasonable rates to all utilities. A rational basis exists to provide procedures for setting rates of such small sewer utilities different from and more limited than those for setting rates of other utilities. Without limiting government regulation of rate setting by small sewer utilities as provided by Section 62-8-7.1 NMSA 1978, the declared policy of the Public Utility Act, the provision of reasonable and proper utility services at fair, just and reasonable rates, and the general welfare, business and industry of the state may be frustrated.\n\nC. The following are declared to be the objects and purposes of this 1991 act. Experience has proven that the construction, development and extension of proper plants and facilities cannot be accomplished without unnecessary duplication and economic waste within areas certificated to water and sewer utilities without controls against duplicative intrusions into certificated areas by municipal utilities. A rational basis exists to prohibit intrusion of municipal water or sewer facilities or service into areas in which a public utility furnishes regulated services until that municipality elects to come within the terms of the Public Utility Act, in which event both systems will be brought into parity of treatment with respect to the commission's independent jurisdiction and power to prevent unreasonable interference between competing plants, lines and systems. Without such controls as provided by Section 62-9-1.1 NMSA 1978, the declared policy of the Public Utility Act, the provision of reasonable and proper utility services at fair, just and reasonable rates and the general welfare, business and industry of the state may be frustrated.\n\nD. The provisions of the 1985 and 1987 acts and of this 1991 act shall be liberally construed to carry out their purposes.\n\nHistory:Laws 1985, ch. 221, § 1; 1987, ch. 52, § 1; 1991, ch. 143, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Sections 62-3-1 to 62-3-5 of the Public Utility Act are still effective as the repeal of Chapter 62, Article 3 by Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, effective July 1, 2003 was repealed prior to taking effect by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003. Although Laws 2003, Chapter 336, Section 8, amended Laws 1998, Chapter 82, as amended, an amendment of a repealed section is ineffective.SeeQuintana v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 100 N.M. 224, 668 P.2d 1101 (1983). Laws 2003, Chapter 416, Section 5 also repealed Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, as amended, a second time, however, that repeal is of no effect as the section had previously been repealed by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.\n\n\"This 1985 act\", referred to in the first sentence of Subsection A, and \"the 1985 . . . acts,\" referred to in Subsection D, refer to Laws 1985, ch. 221, which is presently compiled as 62-3-2.1, 62-8-7, 62-8-7.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe terms \"these 1987 amendments,\" referred to in the first sentence in Subsection B, and \"1987 act,\" referred to in Subsection D, apparently mean Laws 1987, ch. 52, which appears as 62-3-2.1, 62-3-3, 62-8-7.1 and 62-9-2.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe term, \"this 1991 act\", referred to in Subsections C and D, refers to Laws 1991, ch. 143, which is presently compiled as 62-3-2.1 and 62-9-1.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective April 3, 1991, substituted \"62-8-7.1 NMSA 1978\" for \"62-8-7 NMSA 1978, as amended\" near the end of Subsection A and added Subsections C and D.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, added Subsection B and made a minor word change near the beginning of Subsection A.\n\nAn exception for small municipalities was not created.— Subsection C of Section 62-3-2.1 NMSA 1978 lacks the explicit language required to create an exception subjecting small municipalities to the Public Utility Act or to public regulation commission jurisdiction, prohibit municipal utilities from serving in areas covered by a public utility's certificate of convenience and necessity, or expand the scope of the Public Utility Act or the public regulation commission's jurisdiction over municipalities beyond the controls identified in Section 62-9-1.1 NMSA 1978.Moongate Water Co., Inc. v.

Although Laws 2003, Chapter 336, Section 8, amended Laws 1998, Chapter 82, as amended, an amendment of a repealed section is ineffective.SeeQuintana v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 100 N.M. 224, 668 P.2d 1101 (1983). Laws 2003, Chapter 416, Section 5 also repealed Laws 1998, Chapter 108, Section 82, as amended, a second time, however, that repeal is of no effect as the section had previously been repealed by Chapter 23, Section 1, Laws 2003.\n\nLaws 1937, Chapter 100, referred to in the first sentence in Subsection E, was repealed in 1939.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective June 19, 2009, added Subsection P.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective April 7, 2005, added Subsection G(6) to provide that public utility includes a plant, property or facilities for the sale or furnishing of goods or services to reduce the consumption or demand for utilities and is a public utility or an alternative emergency efficiency provider.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, inserted present Subsection I and renumbered subsequent subsections accordingly.\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective January 1, 1999, deleted \"Words and Phrases\" in the section heading; substituted \"public regulation\" for \"New Mexico public utility\" in Subsection B; in Subsection C, substituted \"commissioner\" for \"commissioners\" near the beginning and deleted \"any\" preceding \"a member of\" near the end; substituted \"a\" for \"any\" near the beginning of Subsection D; in Subsection E, substituted \"an individual, firm, partnership, company\" for \"individuals, firms, partnerships, companies\" near the beginning, substituted \"cooperative\" for \"cooperatives\" near the middle of Subsection E, substituted \"corporation or lessee, trustee or receiver\" for \"as amended, corporations and lessees, trustees or receivers\" near the middle, and substituted \"'Person' does\" for \"It shall\" in two places in Subsection E; near the end of Subsection G, deleted \"now does or hereafter\"; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nThe 1996 amendment,effective March 6, 1996, substituted \"utility\" for \"service\" in Subsection B; inserted \"class A counties as described in Section 4-36-10 NMSA 1978\" in Subsection D; added the proviso at the end of Paragraph (5) in Subsection G; and made stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, rewrote Subsection A and made stylistic changes in Subsection M.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, in Subsection G, substituted \"stated in Section 62-3-4 and 62-3-4.1 NMSA 1978\" for \"hereinafter stated\" in the opening clause and added Paragraph (5) and made minor language changes throughout the section.\n\nFranchise fees are not rates.— Franchise fees charged by counties pursuant to Section 62-1-3 NMSA 1978 are not rates as defined in Section 62-3-3 NMSA 1978 and do not fall within the jurisdiction of the public regulation commission.El Paso Elec. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2010-NMSC-048, 149 N.M. 174, 246 P.3d 443.\n\nFranchise fees are not taxes.— Franchise fees charged by counties pursuant to Section 62-1-3 NMSA 1978 are not taxes that the public regulation commission may consider when setting rates.El Paso Elec. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2010-NMSC-048, 149 N.M. 174, 246 P.3d 443.\n\nFranchise fees are not items included in adjustment clauses.— Franchise fees charged by counties pursuant to Section 62-1-3 NMSA 1978 are not within the jurisdiction of the public regulation commission by analogy to fuel and purchased power adjustment clauses, over which the commission has jurisdiction under Section 62-8-7 NMSA 1978.El Paso Elec. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2010-NMSC-048, 149 N.M. 174, 246 P.3d 443.\n\nLine item charge for franchise fees.— The public regulation commission did not have jurisdiction to enter an order requiring a public utility to stop including on customer's bills the franchise fee charges paid by the utility to a county for the right to use county right-of-way to deliver utility service to county residents and businesses.El Paso Elec. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm'n, 2010-NMSC-048, 149 N.M. 174, 246 P.3d 443.\n\nUnited States and governmental agencies are not \"persons\".— The legislature, under this section, did not see fit to include or even mention the United States or governmental agencies as \"persons.\"Southern Union Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1971-NMSC-035, 82 N.M. 405, 482 P.2d 913,overruled on another point byDe Vargas Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Campbell, 1975-NMSC-026, 87 N.M. 469, 535 P.2d 1320.\n\nThe words \"person or corporation\" do not in their ordinary signification mean a sovereign government.Southern Union Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1971-NMSC-035, 82 N.M. 405, 482 P.2d 913,overruled on another point byDe Vargas Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Campbell, 1975-NMSC-026, 87 N.M. 469, 535 P.2d 1320.\n\nPublic Service Company of New Mexico.— Although considered a \"public utility\" under this section, the Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) is essentially a private corporation, not a public governmental agency, and its works are not to be considered as \"public works\" projects.Cnty. of Santa Fe v. Pub. Serv. Co., 311 F.3d 1031 (10th Cir. 2002).\n\nReadiness to serve public is principal characteristic of public utility.— The principal determinative characteristic of a public utility is that of service to, or readiness to serve, an indefinite public (or portion of the public as such) which has a legal right to demand and receive its services or commodities.Llano, Inc. v. Southern Union Gas Co., 1964-NMSC-257, 75 N.M. 7, 399 P.2d 646.\n\nIn determining a public utility question, the test is whether or not a person holds himself out, expressly or impliedly, as engaged in the business of supplying his product or service to the public, as a class, or to any limited portion of it.Griffith v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1974-NMSC-024, 86 N.M. 113, 520 P.2d 269.\n\nThe public or private character of the enterprise does not depend on the number of persons by whom it is used, but on whether or not it is open to the use and service of all members of the public who may require it, to the extent of its capacity.Griffith v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1974-NMSC-024, 86 N.M. 113, 520 P.2d 269;Llano, Inc. v. Southern Union Gas Co., 1964-NMSC-257, 75 N.M. 7, 399 P.2d 646.\n\nSufficient part to clothe operation with public interest.— The phrase \"to the public\" means sufficient sales to the public to clothe the operation with a public interest and does not mean willingness to sell to each and every one of the public without discrimination.Griffith v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1974-NMSC-024, 86 N.M. 113, 520 P.2d 269.\n\nClass II transaction not found.— Electric utility's investment in building non-utility facilities for paper company in exchange for the company's promise to reimburse the utility over time through charges for steam and water service was not a purchase of a \"security\" under Subsection K(3) (now Subsection L(3)), and therefore did not constitute a Class II transaction, so as to require prior commission approval.Plains Elec. Generation & Transmission Coop. v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 1998-NMSC-038, 126 N.M. 152, 967 P.2d 827.\n\nCorporation not serving public is not public utility.— Where corporation had not held nor was holding itself as ready, willing and able to provide natural gas service to or for the public or any segment thereof, it could not be considered a public utility.Llano, Inc. v. Southern Union Gas Co., 1964-NMSC-257, 75 N.M. 7, 399 P.2d 646.\n\nWater association in control of developer of subdivision is public utility,as the character of the use is to serve all members of the public who buy lots from the developer, and the extent of the use is that an entire housing development is dependent upon the association for a prime necessity of life.Griffith v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1974-NMSC-024, 86 N.M. 113, 520 P.2d 269.\n\nFormerly, cooperatives did not come within definition of \"public utility\".Socorro Elec. Coop. v. Pub. Serv. Co., 1959-NMSC-105, 66 N.M. 343, 348 P.2d 88.\n\nPublic service (now public regulation) commission was not required to delineate an electric cooperative's service areawhere part of its system was in an area previously certificated to another utility.Lea Cnty. Elec. Coop. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1965-NMSC-057, 75 N.M. 191, 402 P.2d 377, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 969, 87 S. Ct. 506, 17 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1966).\n\nCooperatives may not be made utilities but excepted from regulations upon others.— Laws 1961, ch. 89 (repealed), insofar as it attempted to place rural electric cooperatives under the Public Utility Act by including them within the definition of \"public utility\" constituted an arbitrary and unreasonable classification in violation of the equal protection clauses because cooperatives were included in the act though not required to render service to the general public and no provision was made for complete regulation of rates charged by them or securities issued by them, whereas other electric utilities had to render service to the public and their rates and financing were completely supervised and controlled.Community Pub. Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1966-NMSC-053, 76 N.M. 314, 414 P.2d 675, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 933, 87 S. Ct. 292, 17 L. Ed. 2d 213.\n\nNo distinction made between utilities based on form of ownership.— The New Mexico legislature has made no distinction between public utilities operated as individuals, firms, partnerships, companies or corporations. Nowhere in the New Mexico Public Utility Act is the commission given authority, for the purpose of rate-making, to make a distinction between a public utility operated as a corporation from one operated as a sole proprietorship.Moyston v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 1966-NMSC-062, 76 N.M. 146, 412 P.2d 840.\n\nMunicipality not an \"interested electric utility.\"— The definition of \"person\" in Subsection E of this section controls the meaning of \"interested electric utility\" in Section 62-6-25B NMSA 1978 and, thus, a municipality that had not elected to come within the terms of the Public Utility Act was not authorized to seek wheeling orders from the commission.Pub. Serv. Co. v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 1999-NMSC-040, 128 N.M. 309, 992 P.2d 860.\n\nRegulation of \"optional utility programs.\"— Commission had jurisdiction to require utility to establish a corporate subsidiary for purposes of instituting gas and electric \"optional utility programs,\" which included surge suppression, maintenance and repair services, information services, and power quality solutions.PNM Elec. Servs. v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 1998-NMSC-017, 125 N.M. 302, 961 P.2d 147.\n\nUnregulated municipalities must comply with liquefied petroleum gas statutes.— Inasmuch as municipally operated and owned utilities are not subject to regulation by the public service commission (now public regulation commission) (unless they so elect), a village is required to comply with provisions relating to liquefied petroleum gas. 1948 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 48-5156.\n\nObligation of state agency.— A state agency, like any other user of utility service, has the statutory obligation to pay the rates therefor, including any late charges, under schedules approved by the commission, since late charges fall within the definition of \"rate\" in this section. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-80.\n\nExtent of undertaking limits obligation to serve.— One who undertakes to serve the public undertakes an obligation which is limited by the extent of his profession, and he cannot be compelled to serve beyond the limits of that profession. Gas utility not required to serve city constructing line to utility's line. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-277.\n\nCorporation may subject itself to regulation by selling electricity for resale to public.— When one utility sells electrical energy to another utility only, and not to the public, it is not subject to the provisions of this section, but notwithstanding the fact that by such operation it does not become a public utility, it subjects itself to regulation by the public service commission (now public regulation commission) when sale of the electricity is for resale to the public, to the extent necessary to determine that the cost to the utility shall be reasonable. 1952 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 52-5618.\n\nCorporation may subject itself to regulation by selling water to municipal utility.— An individual operating a water service and selling at wholesale to a municipally-owned utility would be a public utility to the extent his operation affects the public interest and as such is subject to the jurisdiction of the public service commission (now public regulation commission). 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5715.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Cost of Service Indexing: An Analysis of New Mexico's Experiment in Public Utility Regulation,\" see 9 N.M. L.
