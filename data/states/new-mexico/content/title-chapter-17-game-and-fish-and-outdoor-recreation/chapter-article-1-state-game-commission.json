      "text": "It is the purpose of this act and the policy of the state of New Mexico to provide an adequate and flexible system for the protection of the game and fish of New Mexico and for their use and development for public recreation and food supply, and to provide for their propagation, planting, protection, regulation and conservation to the extent necessary to provide and maintain an adequate supply of game and fish within the state of New Mexico.\n\nHistory:Laws 1921, ch. 35, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 57-101; Laws 1931, ch. 117, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 43-101; 1953 Comp., § 53-1-1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The words \"this act\" were substituted by the 1931 amendment to this section for the words \"this bill\", which appeared in the 1921 act. If referring to the 1921 act, they would refer to 17-1-1 to 17-1-4, 17-1-14, 17-1-27 and 17-2-6 NMSA 1978. If referring to the 1931 act, they would refer to 17-1-1, 17-1-5, 17-1-15, 17-1-26, 17-2-1, 17-2-5, 17-2-7, 17-2-9 and 17-2-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nCross references.— For transfer of radio communication property of remote sites from department of game and fish to communications division of department of general services,see15-2-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor public lands generally,seeChapter 19 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the Off-Highway Motorcycle Act,see66-3-1001 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor water law generally,seeChapter 72 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor animals generally,seeChapter 77 NMSA 1978.\n\nWild game elk.— The game and fish laws in Chapter 17 are expressly intended to cover free-roaming, wild game elk; the animal statutes in Article 18 of Chapter 30 of the Criminal Code do not apply.State v. Parson, 2005-NMCA-083, 137 N.M. 773, 115 P.3d 236.\n\nAllocation of licenses based on residency, impermissible discrimination.— The allocation of licenses for bighorn, oryx and ibex by the state game commission on the basis of residency discriminates impermissibly against nonresidents under the federal constitution.Terk v. Gordon, No. 74-387-M (D.N.M., filed Aug. 25, 1977),aff'd, 436 U.S. 850, 98 S. Ct. 3063, 56 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1978).\n\nFee structure, although discriminatory, not offensive.— The present fee structure in 17-3-13 NMSA 1978, which discriminates against nonresidents, is not offensive to either the privileges and immunities clause, U.S. Const., art. IV, § 2, or the U.S. Const., amend. XIV.Terk v. Gordon, No. 74-387-M (D.N.M., filed Aug. 25, 1977),aff'd, 436 U.S. 850, 98 S. Ct. 3063, 56 L.

Red River Valley Co., 1945-NMSC-034, 51 N.M. 207, 182 P.2d 421.\n\nState's powers are dedicated to fishing and recreation.— Since public waters of the state by legislative enactment are dedicated to public uses of fishing and recreation, Conchas Lake is covered by these provisions.State ex rel. State Game Comm'n v. Red River Valley Co., 1945-NMSC-034, 51 N.M. 207, 182 P.2d 421.\n\nEnclosing public waters cannot prevent fishing or hunting.— Fact that an adjoining landowner encloses waters which belong to the public does not make thereof a privately owned enclosure, and its treatment as such by the state would involve granting of a special \"right\" or \"privilege\" which is prohibited by the constitution, so that a license holder could not be prevented from fishing or hunting on the enclosure.State ex rel. State Game Comm'n v. Red River Valley Co., 1945-NMSC-034, 51 N.M. 207, 182 P.2d 421.\n\nCarrying firearms before hunting season opens may be prohibited.— Powers granted to state game commission include authority to prohibit the carrying of firearms in hunting areas for specified periods of time before opening of the big game season. 1948 Op.

Ed. 2d 751 (1978).\n\nFee structure, although discriminatory, is not offensive.— The present fee structure in 17-3-13 NMSA 1978, which discriminates against nonresidents, is not offensive to either the privileges and immunities clause, U.S. Const., art. IV, § 2, or the U.S. Const., amend. XIV.Terk v. Gordon, No. 74-387-M (D.N.M., filed Aug. 25, 1977),aff'd, 436 U.S. 850, 98 S. Ct. 3063, 56 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1978).\n\nMoney in the game protection fund may be used only for the purposes providedin the game and fish laws. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-38.\n\nGame and fish department funds may not be legally spent for out-of-state travelby state game and fish department personnel for purposes of advertising New Mexico's game and fish resources. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-216.\n\nThere are no provisions for reimbursement of license feesin any circumstances; therefore, persons who have purchased a second license illegally are not entitled to reimbursement for the second license. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-38.\n\nInterest credited to game protection fund, not general fund.— Any interest earned on the investment of money in the game protection fund must be credited to that fund, not the state general fund. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-01.\n\nUse of fire suppression fund appropriated to game and fish department.— A fire suppression fund appropriated to the department of game and fish was not to actually be transferred to the forest conservation commission (now abolished). The department of game and fish was simply authorized to contract with the forest conservation commission to perform fire suppression activities reasonably necessary for the protection of game and fish. The formula to be utilized in providing and paying for such services was a contractual matter between these two agencies. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-54.\n\n\"Public waters\" are all unappropriated waters from natural streams.— The term \"public waters\" as used in this section is synonymous with the definition of public waters given by the New Mexico supreme court in the case of State ex rel. State Game Comm'n v. Red River Valley Co., 1945-NMSC-034, 51 N.M. 207, 182 P.2d 421 where the court stated: \"All of our unappropriated waters from 'every natural stream, perennial or torrential, within the state of New Mexico,' Article 16, Section 2, New Mexico Constitution, are public waters. These waters belong to the public until beneficially appropriated. And since the right to fish in public waters, by the test of any rule, is universally recognized, it cannot be said that the right to fish and to use the unappropriated public waters in question is less secure in the public because we determine their character as public by immemorial custom, and Spanish or Mexican law which we have adopted and follow in this respect. . . .\" 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-57.\n\nPublic waters may be stocked.— The waters of our streams, whether perennial or torrential in nature, are public waters such as may be stocked by the fish and game commission. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-38.\n\nMunicipal reservoirs and waters on Indian and military reservations where fishing fee is charged may not be stocked.— It is not legally proper for the department of game and fish to consider as public waters within the meaning of this section municipal reservoirs and waters on Indian and military reservations where public fishing is permitted, but only on condition of payment of a fee(s) in addition to possession of a valid fishing license. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-319.\n\nIndian and military reservations are not instrumentalities of the state of New Mexico, and the lands adjacent thereto are not subject to state control as are the lands of the municipalities. This is true even though the waters running through such property are \"public waters\" as declared in State ex rel. State Game Comm'n v. Red River Valley Co., 1945-NMSC-034, 51 N.M. 207, 182 P.2d 421. In such instance, the general public would be trespassing upon land not open to the free access of the public. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-57.\n\nSmall municipal charge for use of lake does not prevent stocking.— A small charge by a municipality sufficient to cover sanitation and maintenance expense for recreational purposes does not change the character of a lake from that of \"public waters,\" and it may be stocked by the state game commission at state expense. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-57.\n\nPrivate waters may be stocked.— If stocking in private, lawfully posted water would not be to such an extent as to deprive the citizenry of a source of public recreation, it may be done. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-246.\n\nPrivate waters may be stocked only with fry and fingerlings and for consideration.— By use of the terms \"fry\" and \"fingerlings,\" the legislature thereby excluded the stocking of any fish larger than fry or fingerlings in private waters. Hence, the authorization to stock fish in private waters is limited to fry or fingerlings, and then for a consideration. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-246.\n\nSection lists purposes for which waters may be closed to fishing.— The three purposes for which a public stream or lake or portion thereof may be closed to fishing are set forth in Subsection G (now Subsection B(8)) of this section. These purposes are when it is necessary to protect recently stocked water, to protect spawning waters or to prevent undue depletion of fish. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-119.\n\nPurpose for which waters may be closed are exclusive.— The state game commission is not authorized under this section to close any public stream or lake or portion thereof to fishing, when such action is not for the purpose of protecting a recently stocked water or to protect spawning waters, or to prevent undue depletion of the fish in such waters. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-119.\n\nDictates of experience and local regulations govern handling of explosives.— The department of game and fish in transporting and storing explosives about the state and through cities and towns must adopt precautionary measures following the dictates of good judgment, based on experience in handling explosives, and local regulations. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-42.\n\nLaw reviews.— For student article, \"Preventing the Extinction of Candidate Species: The Lesser Prairie-Chicken in New Mexico\", see 49 Nat. Resources J. 525 (2009).\n\nAm.
