Whenever any two or more contiguous municipalities wish to consolidate as one municipality, the governing body of each municipality shall appoint three commissioners who shall prepare the terms for consolidation and submit the terms for consolidation to the respective governing bodies. If each governing body approves the terms for consolidation, it shall adopt an ordinance declaring approval of the terms for consolidation and shall provide for an election on the question of consolidation. The election shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of the Local Election Act [Chapter 1, Article 22 NMSA 1978].\n\nB.

The municipal clerk of each municipality shall notify the secretary of finance and administration and the secretary of taxation and revenue that the consolidation has been approved by the electorate. If the question of consolidating the municipalities fails to receive a majority vote favoring consolidation in any one of the municipalities, the consolidation shall fail.\n\nC. If on the day of the election on consolidation any municipality proposing to consolidate has outstanding indebtedness or a judgment payable from a tax on property and the consolidation is approved, a tax sufficient to pay the interest and principal on such indebtedness or judgment shall continue to be levied on the property within the boundary of the municipality as it existed on the day of the election on the question of consolidation.
