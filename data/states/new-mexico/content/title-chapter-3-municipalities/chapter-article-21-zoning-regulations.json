      "text": "A. For the purpose of promoting health, safety, morals or the general welfare, a county or municipality is a zoning authority and may regulate and restrict within its jurisdiction the:\n\n(1) height, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures;\n\n(2) percentage of a lot that may be occupied;\n\n(3) size of yards, courts and other open space;\n\n(4) density of population; and\n\n(5) location and use of buildings, structures and land for trade, industry, residence or other purposes.\n\nB. The county or municipal zoning authority may:\n\n(1) divide the territory under its jurisdiction into districts of such number, shape, area and form as is necessary to carry out the purposes of Sections 3-21-1 through 3-21-14 NMSA 1978; and\n\n(2) regulate or restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or land in each district. All such regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of buildings within each district, but regulation in one district may differ from regulation in another district.\n\nC. All state-licensed or state-operated community residences for persons with a mental or developmental disability and serving ten or fewer persons may be considered a residential use of property for purposes of zoning and may be permitted use in all districts in which residential uses are permitted generally, including particularly residential zones for single-family dwellings.\n\nD. A board of county commissioners of the county in which the greatest amount of the territory of the petitioning village, community, neighborhood or district lies may declare by ordinance that a village, community, neighborhood or district is a \"traditional historic community\" upon petition by twenty-five percent or more of the qualified electors of the territory within the village, community, neighborhood or district requesting the designation. The number of qualified electors shall be based on county records as of the date of the last general election.\n\nE. Any village, community, neighborhood or district that is declared a traditional historic community shall be excluded from the extraterritorial zone and extraterritorial zoning authority of any municipality whose extraterritorial zoning authority extends to include all or a portion of the traditional historic community and shall be subject to the zoning jurisdiction of the county in which the greatest portion of the traditional historic community lies.\n\nF. Zoning authorities, including zoning authorities of home rule municipalities, shall accommodate multigenerational housing by creating a mechanism to allow up to two kitchens within a single-family zoning district, such as conditional use permits.\n\nG. For the purpose of this section, \"multigenerational\" means any number of persons related by blood, common ancestry, marriage, guardianship or adoption.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-20-1, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300; 1977, ch. 279, § 20; 1995, ch. 170, § 4; 1995, ch. 211, § 3; 2007, ch. 46, § 3; 2007, ch. 270, § 1; 2019, ch. 212, § 183.\n\nCross references.— For building construction and restrictions,see3-18-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor Special Zoning District Act,see3-21-15 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor Historic District Act,see3-22-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor Municipal Airport Zoning Law,see3-39-16 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor powers and duties of joint airport zoning board,see64-2-1, 64-2-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor Scenic Highway Zoning Act,see67-13-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective April 3, 2019, in Subsection D, deleted \"registered\" preceding each occurrence of \"qualified electors\".\n\n2007 Amendments.— Laws 2007, ch. 270, § 1, effective June 15, 2007, added Subsections F and G, which provided for multigenerational housing.\n\nLaws 2007, ch. 46, § 3, effective June 15, 2007, in Subsection C, deleted \"the mentally ill or developmentally disabled\" and added \"persons with a mental or developmental disability and\"; and in Subsection D, after \"which the greatest\", deleted \"portion\" and added \"amount\".\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective April 6, 1995, substituted \"Sections 3-21-1 through 3-21-14 NMSA 1978\" for \"Sections 14-20-1 through 14-20-12 NMSA 1953\" in Paragraph (b)(1), and added Subsections D and E.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nOccasional showing of adult film did not violate zoning ordinance applicable to adult amusement establishments.— Where a municipal zoning ordinance defined an adult amusement establishment as a theater that provided motion pictures characterized by an emphasis on specified anatomical areas or sexual activities; the ordinance did not specify how many pornographic films a theater must show to qualify as an adult amusement establishment; defendant was an art-house theater that usually featured non-pornographic independent films and only occasionally showed adult films; on one weekend defendant hosted an erotic film festival called \"Pornotopia\" that featured a film characterized by an emphasis on specified anatomical areas or sexual activities; and defendant was not an adult theater either in function or appearance, defendant was not an adult amusement establishment as defined in the zoning ordinance.State v. Pangaea Cinema. L.L.C., 2013-NMSC-044,rev'g2012-NMCA-075, 284 P.3d 1090.\n\nA movie theater was an adult amusement establishment for showing one adult movie.— Where defendant, who operated an art-house movie theater, was prosecuted under the municipality's zoning ordinance covering adult amusement establishments for showing one pornographic film during a weekend festival of X-rated fare; and the ordinance defined an adult amusement establishment as an establishment, such as a theater, that provides entertainment featuring films of specified anatomical areas or the conduct of specified sexual activities, defendant was an adult amusement establishment as defined in the ordinance and was subject to the terms of the ordinance when defendant showed only one adult movie.City of Albuquerque v. Pangaea Cinema, LLC, 2012-NMCA-075, 284 P.3d 1090, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-007.\n\nZoning ordinance regulating adult amusement establishments was not unconstitutionally vague.— Where defendant, who operated an art-house movie theater, was prosecuted under the municipality's zoning ordinance covering adult amusement establishments for showing one pornographic film during a weekend festival of X-rated fare; the ordinance defined an adult amusement establishment as an establishment, such as a theater, that provides entertainment featuring films of specified anatomical areas or the conduct of specified sexual activities; a reasonable theater owner would have been on notice that the film screened by defendant was an adult film as defined by the ordinance and would have been on notice that its conduct was prohibited the ordinance; and there was no evidence that the municipality selectively enforced by the ordinance or singled out defendant or that the municipality improperly trained its officers in identifying adult films and citing violators; and the ordinance was not susceptible to arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement because it did not have a threshold standard for movie theaters exhibiting adult movies, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague as applied.City of Albuquerque v. Pangaea Cinema, LLC, 2012-NMCA-075, 284 P.3d 1090, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-007.\n\nZoning ordinance regulating adult amusement establishments did not abridge freedom of speech.— Where defendant, who operated an art-house movie theater, was prosecuted under the municipality's zoning ordinance covering adult amusement establishments for showing one pornographic film during a weekend festival of X-rated fare; the ordinance allowed adult films to be shown only in specified zones and prohibited the public screening of such films in other areas, including the area where the theater was located; about five percent of the municipality's area was zoned to allow the exhibition of adult films; the municipality enacted the ordinance not to regulate the content of films, but to combat the negative secondary effects produced by showing adult films; and defendant could show adult movies in areas of the municipality that were zoned for the exhibition of adult films, the ordinance was a constitutionally valid regulation of the time, place, and manner of the exhibition of adult films as applied to defendant and did not abridge defendant's freedom of speech.City of Albuquerque v. Pangaea Cinema, LLC, 2012-NMCA-075, 284 P.3d 1090, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-007.\n\n\"Mining\" defined.— Where a county zoning ordinance prohibited mining of any type, but did not define \"mining\", and where a landowner mined sand and gravel from federal BLM land, the stockpiling of the mined sand and gravel on the landowner's adjacent land did not constitute \"mining\" as it is commonly defined.San Pedro Neighborhood Ass'n. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs of Santa Fe Cnty., 2009-NMCA-045, 146 N.M. 106, 206 P.3d 1011.\n\n\"Commercial use\" defined.— Where a county zoning ordinance prohibited commercial uses, but did not define \"commercial use\", and where a landowner mined sand and gravel from federal BLM land, the stockpiling of the mined sand and gravel on the landowner's adjacent land pending removal for sale constituted a \"commercial\" use under its ordinary meaning.San Pedro Neighborhood Ass'n. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs of Santa Fe Cnty., 2009-NMCA-045, 146 N.M. 106, 206 P.3d 1011.\n\nCommercial impracticability.— Where a county zoning ordinance prohibited the stockpiling of the mined sand and gravel on a landowner's land which the landowner mined from adjacent BLM land under a lease from the BLM and where the evidence showed that the landowner experienced difficulty in limiting the mining and stockpiling of sand and gravel to the BLM land, the evidence was not sufficient to show that the application of the zoning ordinance to the landowner's land conflicted with federal law by rendering the mining operation on federal land commercially impracticable.San Pedro Neighborhood Ass'n. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs of Santa Fe Cnty., 2009-NMCA-045, 146 N.M. 106, 206 P.3d 1011.\n\nPreexisting lawful uses.— The grandfather clause of a zoning ordinance which provided that wireless telecommunications facilities that existed on or before the effective date of the new ordinance \"shall be allowed to continue as they presently exist, as legally permitted non-conforming uses\" applied only to existing communications towers that were lawful under preexisting ordinances and did not immunize unlawful facilities.City of Rio Rancho v. Logan, 2008-NMCA-011, 143 N.M. 281, 175 P.3d 949.\n\nLegislative action.— If a zoning decision has general application and was drawn to apply in the same way concurrently and in the future to all similarly situated properties, it is legislative. The fact that the vacant property remaining to be developed in a district belongs to a limited number of parties does not mean that the zoning action is necessarily quasi-judicial in nature. The fact that a particular party's proposed development or a particular parcel is in the mind of the zoning authority when it takes action does not change the nature of the zoning authority's decision from legislative to quasi-judicial.Albuquerque Commons P'ship v. Albuquerque City Council, 2006-NMCA-143, 140 N.M. 751, 149 P.3d 67,rev'd, 2008-NMSC-025, 144 N.M. 99, 184 P.3d 411.\n\nThe uniformity requirementdoes not prohibit different classifications within a district so long as they are reasonable and based on the public policy to be served.Albuquerque Commons P'ship v. Albuquerque City Council, 2006-NMCA-143, 140 N.M. 751, 149 P.3d 67,rev'd, 2008-NMSC-025, 144 N.M. 99, 184 P.3d 411.\n\nWhen a zoning resolutionis in substance an ordinance or a permanent regulation, the name given to the resolution is immaterial, and if it is passed with all the formality of an ordinance, the resolution thereby becomes a legislative act.Albuquerque Commons P'ship v. Albuquerque City Council, 2006-NMCA-143, 140 N.M. 751, 149 P.3d 67,rev'd, 2008-NMSC-025, 144 N.M. 99, 184 P.3d 411.\n\nComprehensive scheme to regulate land.— The Zoning Act affords counties a comprehensive scheme to regulate land use as a way to protect public health, safety and welfare.Cerrillos Gravel Products, Inc. v. Santa Fe Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 2005-NMSC-023, 138 N.M. 126, 117 P.3d 932.\n\nDefinition of zoning.— Zoning is defined as governmental regulation of the uses of land and buildings according to districts or zones. When used to promote the public interest, it is justified and has been upheld as a legitimate exercise of the police power. New Mexico has specifically approved its use to protect and promote the safety, health, morals and general welfare.Miller v. City of Albuquerque, 1976-NMSC-052, 89 N.M. 503, 554 P.2d 665.\n\nCounty's authority to promulgate zoning ordinances must come from enabling legislation from the state legislature,and therefore, any exercise of power under a zoning ordinance must be authorized by statute.Burroughs v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1975-NMSC-051, 88 N.M. 303, 540 P.2d 233.\n\nAs municipality has no zoning authority beyond that provided by this article.Mechem v. City of Santa Fe, 1981-NMSC-104, 96 N.M. 668, 634 P.2d 690;City of Santa Fe v. Armijo, 1981-NMSC-102, 96 N.M. 663, 634 P.2d 685.\n\nJurisdiction to determine interest in property.— Extraterritorial zoning association did not have the authority to question whether a zoning petitioner's interest in the subject property was sufficient to support its proposed activities.Western PCS II Corp. v. Extraterritorial Zoning Auth., 957 F. Supp. 1230 (D.N.M. 1997).\n\nZoning ordinance is attached with a presumption of validity.— The burden is on a sign owner to overcome this presumption by proving that an ordinance is not reasonably related to its stated purpose.Temple Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-055, 98 N.M. 138, 646 P.2d 565.\n\nAesthetics justifies exercise of police power.— Aesthetic considerations alone justify the exercise of the police power. Ordinances must still, however, be construed for their reasonableness in relation to aesthetic purposes. Moreover, if the ordinance in question impinges on a fundamental right, then the ordinance must \"directly advance\" the interests of aesthetics.Temple Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-055, 98 N.M. 138, 646 P.2d 565.\n\nZoning restriction must relate to use of property.— Zoning concerns the regulation of the uses of land and buildings; a restriction upon ownership which amounts to a mere license or privilege to an individual, and which is not related to the use of property is ultra vires and invalid.Mechem v. City of Santa Fe, 1981-NMSC-104, 96 N.M. 668, 634 P.2d 690.\n\nCounties have statutory authority to enact general police power and zoning ordinances;however, enactment procedures and regulatory powers differ between the two.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. City of Las Vegas, 1980-NMSC-137, 95 N.M. 387, 622 P.2d 695.\n\n\"Amortization\" is constitutional means to terminate nonconforming use.— If an amortization period is reasonable, it is a constitutional means for municipalities to terminate nonconforming uses and, as such, is a constitutional alternative to just compensation.Temple Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-055, 98 N.M. 138, 646 P.2d 565.\n\n\"Amortization\" does not connote a requirement of compensation, but merely suggests that a sign owner or user is put on notice that he has a certain period of time in which to make necessary adjustments to bring his nonconforming structure into conformity with a sign ordinance.Temple Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-055, 98 N.M. 138, 646 P.2d 565.\n\nEffect of private restrictions.— Zoning ordinances if less stringent do not diminish the legal effect of more restrictive private building restrictions.Ridge Park Home Owners v. Pena, 1975-NMSC-063, 88 N.M. 563, 544 P.2d 278.\n\nPurpose of a municipal historical zoning ordinance was within the term \"general welfare,\"as used in municipal zoning enabling legislation.City of Santa Fe v. Gamble-Skogmo, Inc., 1964-NMSC-016, 73 N.M. 410, 389 P.2d 13.\n\nII. SPOT ZONING.\n\nSpot zoning.— The term \"spot zoning\" refers to the rezoning of a small parcel of land to permit a use that fails to comply with a comprehensive plan or is inconsistent with the surrounding area, grants a discriminatory benefit to the parcel owner, and/or harms neighboring properties or the community welfare. Spot zoning is determined on an ad hoc basis, depending on the facts and circumstances of each case.Watson v. Town Council of Town of Bernalillo, 1991-NMCA-009, 111 N.M. 374, 805 P.2d 641.\n\nScope of inquiry.— When examining a charge of spot zoning, courts look not only at the zoning of the immediately adjoining properties, but also to the surrounding area.Bennett v. City Council for City of Las Cruces, 1999-NMCA-015, 126 N.M. 619, 973 P.2d 871 (Ct. App. 1998).\n\nNo spot zoning.— Where the zoning of a 4.2 acre tract was changed from residential to commercial, while the immediately adjacent properties were zoned single-family and high-density residential; the surrounding area consisted of mixed commercial and residential uses; the rezoning was consistent with the municipality comprehensive plan; and the commercial use of the property would create jobs for the benefit of the community; the rezoning of the tract did not constitute impermissible spot zoning.Bennett v. City Council for City of Las Cruces, 1999-NMCA-015, 126 N.M. 619, 973 P.2d 871.\n\nQuasi-judicial action.— When a zoning action is specifically designed to affect a relatively small number of properties and does not apply to similarly situated properties in the surrounding area or city-wide, that action is quasi-judicial, not legislative.Albuquerque Commons v. Albuquerque City Council, 2008-NMSC-025, 144 N.M. 99, 184 P.3d 411,rev'g, 2006-NMCA-143, 140 N.M. 751, 149 P.3d 67.\n\nThe criteria for approval of zone map changes does not apply to special use permits.— The criteria established in Albuquerque Commons Partnership v. City Council of Albuquerque, 2008-NMSC-025, 144 N.M. 99, 184 P.3d 411, for the approval of a zoning map change, which requires proof that there is a public need for a change of the kind in question and that need will be best served by changing the classification of the particular piece of property in question as compared with other available property, does not apply to the issuance of temporary special-use permits.Ricci v. Bernalillo Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Commissioners, 2011-NMCA-114, 150 N.M. 777, 266 P.3d 646.\n\nWhere the developer of a subdivision within a residential area discovered a deposit of sand and gravel in the process of grading the property; the developer applied for a special use permit to remove the sand and gravel; the county commission applied the \"more advantageous to the community\" standard; and the county commission granted the special-use permit for two years, the county commission's refusal to apply the criteria established in Albuquerque Commons Partnership v. City Council of Albuquerque, 2008-NMSC-025, 144 N.M. 99, 184 P.3d 411, for a proposed zone map change, which requires proof that there is a public need for a change of the kind in question and that need will be best served by changing the classification of the particular piece of property in question as compared with other available property, was in accordance with law.Ricci v. Bernalillo Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Commissioners, 2011-NMCA-114, 150 N.M. 777, 266 P.3d 646.\n\nIII. CHANGE OF ZONING.\n\nNo discretion to change zoning without considering substantive criteria for zoning changes.— Where state case law and a municipal resolution required the municipality to establish the substantive criteria of change, mistake or a more advantageous use category before changing the zoning classification of property, the municipality had no discretion to proceed to downzone the landowner's property without providing evidence to justify the change in accordance with the substantive criteria.Albuquerque Commons P'ship v. Albuquerque City Council, 2009-NMCA-065, 146 N.M. 568, 212 P.3d 1122, cert. granted, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 363, 223 P.3d 360 and cert. denied, 1305 S.Ct. 1501, 176 L.Ed. 2d 110 (2010).\n\nZoning text amendments and zoning map amendments.— New Mexico law recognizes that a zoning text amendment is different from a zone reclassification by map amendment. Zoning text amendments specify the allowed or permitted uses within a particular existing zoning district classification. Zoning map amendments involve the zoning district reclassification of a particular tract of land by alteration of the official zoning map.Albuquerque Commons P'ship v. Albuquerque City Council, 2006-NMCA-143, 140 N.M. 751, 149 P.3d 67,rev'd, 2008-NMSC-025, 144 N.M. 99, 184 P.3d 411.\n\nThe change or mistake ruledoes not apply to rezoning by text amendment.Albuquerque Commons P'ship v. Albuquerque City Council, 2006-NMCA-143, 140 N.M. 751, 149 P.3d 67,rev'd, 2008-NMSC-025, 144 N.M. 99, 184 P.3d 411.\n\nIV. DOWN ZONING.\n\nDownzoning defined.— The characteristic common to all downzoning actions is that they focus on specific properties or small groups of properties within an otherwise similarly situated class, restricting or allowing uses in ways that do not apply to the surrounding area or similar areas within a municipality.Albuquerque Commons v. Albuquerque City Council, 2008-NMSC-025, 144 N.M. 99, 184 P.3d 411,rev'g, 2006-NMCA-143, 140 N.M. 751, 149 P.3d 67.\n\nCommon characteristic of downzoning.— Where the city council adopted a text amendment to a sector plan as a legislative action to create a new sub-zone within the sector plan area, which consisted of three parcels comprising six percent of the sector plan area and to impose additional, significantly more restrictive regulations that were applicable only to the new sub-zone, the amendment was a downzoing of property in the new sub-zone and a quasi-judicial action that denied the property owners in the sub-zone due process of law.Albuquerque Commons v. Albuquerque City Council, 2008-NMSC-025, 144 N.M. 99, 184 P.3d 411,rev'g, 2006-NMCA-143, 140 N.M. 751, 149 P.3d 67.\n\nNo down-zoning.— Where zoning text amendments were consistent with city's master plan, quantified and made more specific the city's policy vision to assure development of an urban center as stated in its comprehensive plan and in the prior zoning provisions and delineated how that vision would specifically come to pass in future development, and the changes applied to all property owners within the district, the zoning text amendments did not constitute a down-zoning and were legislative in nature.Albuquerque Commons P'ship v. Albuquerque City Council, 2006-NMCA-143, 140 N.M. 751, 149 P.3d 67,rev'd, 2008-NMSC-025, 144 N.M. 99, 184 P.3d 411.\n\nV. STATE AND FEDERAL IMMUNITY.\n\nImmunity of state.— The state is immune from any municipal zoning regulations.City of Albuquerque v. Jackson Bros. Inc., 1991-NMCA-140, 113 N.M. 149, 823 P.2d 949.\n\nTest to determine whether one political subdivision of the state is immune from the zoning laws of a co-equal political subdivision of the state.— In zoning and land use disputes between co-equal political subdivisions of the state, the statutory guidance test applies to determine whether a land use proposed by one political subdivision of the state may be prohibited by the zoning regulation of another. Under the statutory guidance test, courts review the statutory powers assigned to each entity to ascertain whether the legislature intended that one entity's local zoning ordinances apply to the other entity's activities.Village of Logan v. Eastern N.M. Water Util. Auth., 2015-NMCA-103.\n\nIn zoning and land use dispute between a municipality and a water utility authority, both of which are political subdivisions of the state established by legislative processes, the legislative purpose behind the creation of the water utility authority would be frustrated by requiring it to adhere to municipal zoning ordinances, and therefore the statutory guidance test applies to immunize the water utility authority from the municipality's zoning ordinances.Village of Logan v. Eastern N.M. Water Util. Auth., 2015-NMCA-103.\n\nState governmental body is not subject to local zoning regulationsor restrictions.City of Santa Fe v. Armijo, 1981-NMSC-102, 96 N.M. 663, 634 P.2d 685.\n\nCounty may not regulate a private entity on state landoperating with the state's approval.County of Santa Fe v. Milagro Wireless, LLC, 2001-NMCA-070, 130 N.M. 771, 32 P.3d 214.\n\nVI. DUE PROCESS AND TAKING ISSUES.\n\nState-created substantive property right.— Where a municipality downzoned the landowner's property by map amendment; state case law required the municipality to establish a mistake in the original zoning or subsequent changed conditions in the neighborhood before the zoning could be legally changed; and a municipal resolution required the municipality to demonstrate that a mistake had occurred in the original zoning, that changed neighborhood or community conditions justify the change, or that a different use category is more advantageous to the community before a zoning classification could be changed by map amendment, the property owner had a state-created property right to continued zoning classification of the landowner's property unless the municipality justified the zoning change in accordance with the criteria of state case law and the municipal resolution.Albuquerque Commons P'ship v. Albuquerque City Council, 2009-NMCA-065, 146 N.M. 568, 212 P.3d 1122, cert. granted, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 363, 223 P.3d 360 and cert. denied, 1305 S.Ct. 1501, 176 L.Ed. 2d 110 (2010).\n\nProperty deprivation or due process violation.— Where state case law and a municipal resolution required the municipality to establish the substantive criteria of change, mistake or a more advantageous use category before changing the zoning classification of property, the failure of the municipality to actually establish one of the substantive criteria does not lead to a property deprivation or due process violation, the deprivation or violation only arises in the event the landowner is denied notice or a meaningful opportunity to be heard before the landowner's property is downzoned.Albuquerque Commons P'ship v. Albuquerque City Council, 2009-NMCA-065, 146 N.M. 568, 212 P.3d 1122, cert. granted, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 363, 223 P.3d 360 and cert. denied, 1305 S.Ct. 1501, 176 L.Ed. 2d 110 (2010).\n\nDue process.— The failure of a municipality to hold a particular type of hearing, such as a legislative or a quasi-judicial hearing, when it contemplates downzoning a landowner's property is not by itself a failure of due process.Albuquerque Commons P'ship v. Albuquerque City Council, 2009-NMCA-065, 146 N.M. 568, 212 P.3d 1122, cert. granted, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 363, 223 P.3d 360 and cert. denied, 1305 S.Ct. 1501, 176 L.Ed. 2d 110 (2010).\n\nWhere the city council determined that the adoption of a sector plan, which downzoned the landowner's property, was a legislative matter to be decided at a legislative hearing; the landowner participated in seven hearings before the city council; the municipality did not limit ex parte contact on the part of the council members; one city councilor, who had been contacted by a non-counselor outside of the hearing and who had been encouraged not to propose amendments to the sector plan that would allow the landowner to retain the existing zoning of the landowner's property, withdrew all of the counselor's proposed amendments, the landowner was not provided with an impartial tribunal and the process violated the landowner's constitutionally protected property right and procedural due process.Albuquerque Commons P'ship v. Albuquerque City Council, 2009-NMCA-065, 146 N.M. 568, 212 P.3d 1122, cert. granted, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 363, 223 P.3d 360 and cert. denied, 1305 S.Ct. 1501, 176 L.Ed. 2d 110 (2010).\n\nDue process and takings claims are not coextensive.— Where a municipality downzoned the landowner's property; the landowner sued the municipality to recover damages for violation of the landowner's due process rights and for the taking of the landowner's property by condemnation, the landowner was under no obligation to seek takings damages before recovering for the due process violation, because the claims are not coextensive. The due process claim is based on the right to continuation of a certain zoning classification until the municipality establishes specific circumstances to justify a change of zoning and the loss resulting from the due process violation is a loss of opportunity to meaningfully participate in a hearing related to the change of zoning. The takings claim is based on the taking of property without a legitimate public interest and the loss resulting from the taking is loss of the economically viable use of the property.Albuquerque Commons P'ship v. Albuquerque City Council, 2009-NMCA-065, 146 N.M. 568, 212 P.3d 1122, cert. granted, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 363, 223 P.3d 360 and cert. denied, 1305 S.Ct. 1501, 176 L.Ed. 2d 110 (2010).\n\nDue process.— The extraterritorial zoning administration lacks the authority to adjudicate questions of property rights, rather than mere use, and thus its decision in this case violates due process requirements.Western PCS II Corp. v. Extraterritorial Zoning Auth., 957 F. Supp. 1230 (D.N.M. 1997).\n\nZoning is not compensable taking.— As a valid exercise of the police power, zoning is not a compensable taking, even when it results in substantial reduction in the value of property. Only if the governmental regulation deprives the owner of all beneficial use of his property will the action be unconstitutional.Miller v. City of Albuquerque, 1976-NMSC-052, 89 N.M. 503, 554 P.2d 665.\n\nIn regard to inverse condemnation,an administrative body has no authority to adjudicate all of the essential facts of the claim or to award damages.Takhar v. Town of Taos, 2004-NMCA-072, 135 N.M. 741, 93 P.3d 762, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-006, 135 N.M. 789, 93 P.3d 1292.\n\nVII. SIGNS.\n\nMunicipal regulation of outdoor advertisingfor aesthetic and safety purposes constitutes a valid exercise of the police power, as that power is derived from authority granted by the state.Battaglini v. Town of Red River, 1983-NMSC-067, 100 N.M. 287, 669 P.2d 1082.\n\nCriteria to determine whether sign ordinance violates free speech.— Where a sign ordinance does not prohibit speech altogether, the precise issue is whether the sign ordinance is a legitimate time, place and manner restriction on speech. The criteria to be analyzed are threefold: (1) does the restriction serve a significant government interest? (2) is the restriction justifiable without reference to the content of the regulated speech? and, (3) does the restriction leave open ample alternative channels of communication?Temple Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-055, 98 N.M. 138, 646 P.2d 565.\n\nSign ordinance not violative of free exercise of religious beliefs.— Where a sign ordinance does not limit what a religious organization may maintain on its signs, the ordinance does not abridge the free exercise of religious beliefs in violation of N.M. Const., art. II, § 11.Temple Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-055, 98 N.M. 138, 646 P.2d 565.\n\nSign ordinance held reasonably related to proper governmental goals.— A sign ordinance regulating the size, height and number of signs is reasonably related to the proper governmental goals of aesthetics and traffic safety.Temple Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-055, 98 N.M. 138, 646 P.2d 565.\n\nWhere the only restriction on political signs is that campaign signs be a certain size, be erected earlier than 60 days prior to a primary or general election and that the campaign signs be removed within 10 days after the election to which the sign pertains, clearly such a limited restriction on these types of political signs furthers a significant government interest in aesthetics.Temple Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-055, 98 N.M. 138, 646 P.2d 565.\n\nAuthority of county to zone school property.— Lands owned by a public school district and used for school purposes, directly and indirectly, and land used for commercial purposes are subject to county zoning and development ordinances. 2005 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 05-03.\n\nLand use ordinances validity depend on ownership of property.— Although counties are designated zoning authorities for the purposes of promoting health, safety, morals and the general welfare, the validity of county land use ordinances attempting to restrict traditional federal and state regulatory authority varies. To the extent the ordinances affect federal lands, they are preempted by the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution; to the extent the ordinances affect state lands, they are nullified by the state's immunity from local zoning ordinances; and finally, to the extent the ordinances affect private lands, they are preempted by federal law, state law, or both. 1994 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 94-01.\n\nAnnexation of zoning district by municipality.— When all or a portion of a special zoning district is annexed by an incorporated municipality, the special zoning district loses all of its zoning jurisdiction over the annexed territory to the municipality. 1983 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 83-06.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Land Use Planning - New Mexico's Green Belt Law,\" see 8 Nat.

Upon the initiative of any municipal governing body or of the board of county commissioners of any county wherein any portion of the extraterritorial zoning area of the municipality lies, the municipality and the county may enter into an agreement providing for the zoning of that portion of the extraterritorial zoning area lying within the county joining in the agreement. In the absence of such agreement, a petition requesting the zoning of the extraterritorial zoning area and signed by twenty-five percent of the qualified electors residing in the extraterritorial zoning area and within the same county may be filed with the county clerk of the county of the petitioners' residence. Upon the filing of such petition, the governing body of the municipality and the board of county commissioners shall enter into an agreement providing for the zoning of that portion of the extraterritorial zoning area lying within the county joining in the agreement. Any agreement entered into pursuant to the provisions of this subsection may be subsequently amended by agreement of both parties.\n\nB. The agreement entered into pursuant to Subsection A of this section shall provide for an extraterritorial zoning commission consisting of equal numbers of members appointed by the municipal zoning authority and the county commission; provided that at least one-half of these members shall reside in the extraterritorial zone. Additionally, one member from an area of the county not within the zoning jurisdiction of the municipality or within the area of the county affected by the proposed extraterritorial zoning ordinance shall be appointed by a majority of the members appointed by the board of county commissioners and by the municipal zoning authority. The agreement shall also provide for a joint municipal-county zoning authority consisting of one or more members of the municipal governing body and one or more members of the board of county commissioners, provided such authority membership shall contain one more county commission member than municipal governing body member.\n\nC. No zoning ordinance shall be adopted by the joint municipal-county zoning authority unless the ordinance has been recommended by the extraterritorial zoning commission.\n\nD. Within three hundred sixty days of the appointment of the last member to be appointed, the extraterritorial zoning commission shall recommend to the joint municipal-county zoning authority a zoning ordinance applicable to all or any portion of the extraterritorial zoning area lying within the county joining in the agreement pursuant to Subsection A of this section. The ordinance shall also provide, subject to the restrictions of Section 3-21-6 NMSA 1978, for the manner in which zoning regulations, restrictions and the boundaries of districts are:\n\n(1) determined, established and enforced; and\n\n(2) amended, supplemented or repealed.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-20-2.2, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 80, § 2; 2001, ch. 78, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For county and municipal jurisdiction over subdivisions,see3-20-5 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor special zoning districts,see3-21-15 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, inserted \"provided that at least one-half of these members shall reside in the extraterritorial zone\" in Subsection B; substituted \"unless the ordinance\" for \"unless the same\" in Subsection C; and updated the internal reference in Subsection D.\n\nLimitation on county of San Miguel's zoning authority.— The county of San Miguel does not have authority to zone within one mile of the city limits of Las Vegas.Bd. of Cnty.

To the extent the ordinances affect federal lands, they are preempted by the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution; to the extent the ordinances affect state lands, they are nullified by the state's immunity from local zoning ordinances; and finally, to the extent the ordinances affect private lands, they are preempted by federal law, state law, or both. 1994 Op.

It may be comprised of several or no documents. It may be found within the ordinance itself where the zoning authority has not enacted a prior comprehensive plan and that absence of a formally adopted comprehensive plan does substantially weaken the presumption of regularity of any zoning ordinance enacted without it.Watson v.

City of Las Vegas, 1980-NMSC-137, 95 N.M. 387, 622 P.2d 695.\n\nComprehensive planning.— A county zoning ordinance was valid where the county had a comprehensive plan in substance if not form at the time the ordinance was enacted.Bogan v.

The burden is on a sign owner to overcome this presumption by proving that an ordinance is not reasonably related to its stated purpose.Temple Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-055, 98 N.M. 138, 646 P.2d 565.\n\nPresumption of correctness regarding initial zoning.— There is a presumption that the initial determination of the type of zoning for a given property is the correct one.Miller v. City of Albuquerque, 1976-NMSC-052, 89 N.M. 503, 554 P.2d 665.\n\nThere is a substantial distinction between amendments to a zoning ordinance as contrasted to ordinances enacting comprehensive zoning;the fundamental justification for an amendatory or repealing zoning ordinance is a change of conditions making the amendment or repeal reasonably necessary to protect the public interest, with another function being the covering and perfecting of previous defective ordinances or correcting mistakes or injustices therein.Miller v. City of Albuquerque, 1976-NMSC-052, 89 N.M. 503, 554 P.2d 665.\n\nOrdinance establishing exceptions.— A county ordinance which among other things establishes certain limited special exceptions is an integral part of the plan required under this section, and the main objectives of requiring that a special permit be obtained before a use of land is commenced are to protect adjoining property and to insure the orderly and efficient development of the community.Burroughs v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1975-NMSC-051, 88 N.M. 303, 540 P.2d 233.\n\nAesthetics justify exercise of police power.— Aesthetic considerations alone justify the exercise of the police power. Ordinances must still, however, be construed for their reasonableness in relation to aesthetic purposes. Moreover, if the ordinance in question impinges on a fundamental right, then the ordinance must \"directly advance\" the interests of aesthetics.Temple Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-055, 98 N.M. 138, 646 P.2d 565.\n\nSign ordinance held reasonably related to proper governmental goals.— A sign ordinance regulating the size, height and number of signs is reasonably related to the proper governmental goals of aesthetics and traffic safety.Temple Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-055, 98 N.M. 138, 646 P.2d 565 (1982).\n\nPurpose of a municipal historical zoning ordinance was within the term \"general welfare,\"as used in municipal zoning enabling legislation.City of Santa Fe v. Gamble-Skogmo, Inc., 1964-NMSC-016, 73 N.M. 410, 389 P.2d 13.\n\nJudicial review.— The district court may not substitute its judgment for that of the board of commissioners, but when it was made to appear by the affidavits and other matters in the record that the board may have improperly failed to consider the matters which it was required to consider in making the zoning change, then a question of fact was presented on the issue of the arbitrariness of the board in granting the special use permit, and it was improper for the court to grant summary judgment and thereby resolve this issue as a matter of law.Cinelli v.

      "text": "A. The zoning authority within its jurisdiction shall provide by ordinance for the manner in which zoning regulations, restrictions and the boundaries of districts are:\n\n(1) determined, established and enforced; and\n\n(2) amended, supplemented or repealed.\n\nB. No zoning regulation, restriction or boundary shall become effective, amended, supplemented or repealed until after a public hearing at which all parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. Notice of the time and place of the public hearing shall be published, at least fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing, within its respective jurisdiction. Whenever a change in zoning is proposed for an area of one block or less, notice of the public hearing shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owners, as shown by the records of the county treasurer, of lots of land within the area proposed to be changed by a zoning regulation and within one hundred feet, excluding public right-of-way, of the area proposed to be changed by zoning regulation. Whenever a change in zoning is proposed for an area of more than one block, notice of the public hearing shall be mailed by first class mail to the owners, as shown by the records of the county treasurer, of lots or [of] land within the area proposed to be changed by a zoning regulation and within one hundred feet, excluding public right-of-way, of the area proposed to be changed by zoning regulation. If the notice by first class mail to the owner is returned undelivered, the zoning authority shall attempt to discover the owner's most recent address and shall remit the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to that address.\n\nC. If the owners of twenty percent or more of the area of the lots and [of] land included in the area proposed to be changed by a zoning regulation or within one hundred feet, excluding public right-of-way, of the area proposed to be changed by a zoning regulation, protest in writing the proposed change in the zoning regulation, the proposed change in zoning shall not become effective unless the change is approved by a majority vote of all the members of the governing body of the municipality or by a two-thirds vote of all the members of the board of county commissioners.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-20-4, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300; 1979, ch. 319, § 1; 1981, ch. 91, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For definition of \"publish\" or \"publication,\"see3-1-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material in Subsections B and C was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\n1979 amendment unconstitutional.— Laws 1979, ch. 319, § 1, which purported to amend this section, is unconstitutional because it violated N.M. Const., art. IV, § 16, which requires that the subject of any act be embraced in the title of the act. City of Albuquerque v. State, 102 N.M. 38, 690 P.2d 1032 (1984).\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nZoning ordinances strictly construed.— Since zoning ordinances are in derogation of the common law, they are to be strictly construed.Nesbit v. City of Albuquerque, 1977-NMSC-107, 91 N.M. 455, 575 P.2d 1340.\n\nMunicipal legislative body is bound to follow the zoning regulations it has adopted,in the exercise of its delegated legislative power.Miller v. City of Albuquerque, 1976-NMSC-052, 89 N.M. 503, 554 P.2d 665.\n\nIntent of enabling statute.— Allowing the legislature to paint with a broad brush, and to leave the details to local governmental entities, is reflected in an enabling statute, which grants counties the authority to pass ordinances defining how their land use ordinances may be enforced.Cerrillos Gravel Products, Inc. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs of Santa Fe, 2004-NMCA-096, 136 N.M. 247, 96 P.3d 1167, cert. granted, 2004-NMCERT-008, 136 N.M. 493, 100 P.3d 198.\n\nState law does not require that ordinance precisely track enabling statuteto be authorized.Cerrillos Gravel Products, Inc. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 2004-NMCA-096, 136 N.M. 247, 96 P.3d 1167, cert. granted, 2004-NMCERT-008, 136 N.M. 493, 100 P.3d 198.\n\nCreation of buffer zone nullifies demand for vote in Subsection C.— Petitioner, who owned 20% or more of the land within 100 feet of tract proposed to be rezoned, could no longer demand a three-fourths vote of all members of the governing body of the city, as required by Subsection C of this section, where applicant for a zoning change created a buffer zone of 100 feet between that portion of his property sought to be rezoned and the lands of adjacent property owners, including petitioner.St. Bede's Episcopal Church v. City of Santa Fe, 1973-NMSC-046, 85 N.M. 109, 509 P.2d 876.\n\nOrdinance held not uncertain.— A city code provision prohibiting the operation of an adult theatre \"within 500 feet of a residential zone\" is not so uncertain that the court is unable, by use of accepted rules of construction, to determine the intent of the city council.Texas Nat'l Theatres, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-004, 97 N.M. 282, 639 P.2d 569.\n\nZoning of private land that was previously federally held.— A county may not adopt a comprehensive zoning ordinance that specifically excludes federally owned land, then later apply the ordinance to private land that was federally owned at the time the ordinance was passed; to zone such land, the county must comply with the notice requirements of this section.Bonito Land & Livestock v. Valencia Cnty. Bd. of Comm'rs, 1998-NMCA-127, 125 N.M. 638, 964 P.2d 199.\n\nMunicipal agreement to rezone illegal.— A contract in which a municipality promised to zone property in a specified manner in exchange for a party's conveyancing of property that it needed for a highway right of way was illegal because such a promise preempted the power of the zoning authority to zone the property according to prescribed legislative procedures.Dacy v. Village of Ruidoso, 1992-NMSC-066, 114 N.M. 699, 845 P.2d 793.\n\nII. SCOPE OF AUTHORITY.\n\nSuspension or revocation of permit.— Santa Fe County's ordinance providing for suspension or revocation of mining permit is consistent with the statutory authority granted by the legislature to pass ordinances defining how land use ordinances will be enforced.Cerrillos Gravel Products, Inc. v. Santa Fe Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 2005-NMSC-023, 138 N.M. 126, 117 P.3d 932.\n\nExpress authority to enact ordinances for enforcement.— Section 3-12-6 NMSA 1978 grants counties the authority to enact ordinances to provide for enforcement of zoning regulations and restrictions.Cerrillos Gravel Products, Inc. v. Santa Fe Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 2005-NMSC-023, 138 N.M. 126, 117 P.3d 932.\n\nAbsence of language including \"revocation of any permit\" in enabling statutedoes not require a court to hold that such authority is not authorized.Cerrillos Gravel Products, Inc. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs of Santa Fe, 2004-NMCA-096, 136 N.M. 247, 96 P.3d 1167,aff'd, 2005-NMSC-023, 138 N.M. 126, 117 P.3d 932.\n\nAuthority of air quality control board to issue special use permits.— There can be no doubt of a county air quality control board's authority to entertain applications for special use permits, and to issue or withhold them after consideration.McCabe v. Hawk, 1982-NMCA-039, 97 N.M. 622, 642 P.2d 608.\n\nSanta Fe County's ordinance, specifically providing for revocation or suspension of mining permit,is consonant with the legislature's grant of power to pass ordinances defining how land use ordinances may be enforced, and within the legislature's grant of authority to institute \"any appropriate action or proceedings\" to confront violations of land use ordinances.Cerrillos Gravel Products, Inc. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs of Santa Fe, 2004-NMCA-096, 136 N.M. 247, 96 P.3d 1167,aff'd, 2005-NMSC-023, 138 N.M. 126, 117 P.3d 932.\n\nIII. HEARING.\n\nFailure to comply denies procedural due process.— By failing to comply with its own published procedures, specifically by failing to give reasons for the proposed change, the environmental planning commission deprived petitioner of notice and the opportunity to prepare an adequate defense to the proposed down zoning, and this was a denial of procedural due process.Miller v. City of Albuquerque, 1976-NMSC-052, 89 N.M. 503, 554 P.2d 665.\n\nConduct of hearing.— It is within a city council's authority to restrict testimony fairly on both sides in a zoning dispute, provided that each party has an opportunity to be heard in accordance with this section and any local rules.Bennett v. City Council, 1999-NMCA-015, 126 N.M. 619, 973 P.2d 871.\n\nPresumption regarding hearing and notice.— In view of the presumption of validity attending the ordinance, and the due performance of duty by public officials, absent any proof to the contrary, it will be presumed the prepassage requirements as to public hearings and notice thereof were had and given.City of Alamogordo v. McGee, 1958-NMSC-078, 64 N.M. 253, 327 P.2d 321.\n\nPostponement of hearing.— Where proper notice was originally provided, an announcement at the hearing of the postponement of consideration of an issue to a later date substantially complied with notice requirements because actual notice of the original hearing and, at that meeting, of the postponed-to hearing was given to affected property owners.Bennett v. City Council, 1999-NMCA-015, 126 N.M. 619, 973 P.2d 871.\n\nNew notice and hearing not required where rezoning affected lesser amount of land than originally requested.— Where proper notice was given of the requested change in zoning of a tract and of the public hearing thereon, and the rezoning change ultimately effected varied from that request only to the extent that a lesser amount of land was rezoned than was originally requested, this did not amount to a change in fundamental character as would require new notice and another hearing.St. Bede's Episcopal Church v. City of Santa Fe, 1973-NMSC-046, 85 N.M. 109, 509 P.2d 876.\n\nIV. NOTICE.\n\nLack of statutory notice is generally held to be jurisdictional defectwhich renders the action taken by the zoning authority void.Nesbit v. City of Albuquerque, 1977-NMSC-107, 91 N.M. 455, 575 P.2d 1340.\n\nSubstantial compliance with statutory notice provisions required.— Although some courts have held that even a minor defect in notice,e.g., 19-day notice instead of 20-day, will invalidate an action taken by the zoning authority, New Mexico does not take such a strict view.Nesbit v. City of Albuquerque, 1977-NMSC-107, 91 N.M. 455, 575 P.2d 1340.\n\nPurpose of section.— In New Mexico, substantial compliance with the statutory notice provisions would satisfy the purpose of this section, but where substantial compliance with mandatory publication requirements is not met, the action of the zoning authority is invalid.Nesbit v. City of Albuquerque, 1977-NMSC-107, 91 N.M. 455, 575 P.2d 1340.\n\nDetermination of adequate notice.— In order to meet the statutory requirement of adequate notice, it must be determined whether notice, as published, fairly apprised the average citizen reading it with the general purpose of what was contemplated. If the notice is insufficient, ambiguous, misleading or unintelligible to the average citizen, it is inadequate to fulfill the statutory purpose of informing interested persons of the hearing so that they may attend and state their views.Bogan v. Sandoval Cnty. Planning & Zoning Comm'n, 1994-NMCA-157, 119 N.M. 334, 890 P.2d 395, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 168, 889 P.2d 203 (1995);Nesbit v. City of Albuquerque, 1977-NMSC-107, 91 N.M. 455, 575 P.2d 1340.\n\nActual notice constituted substantial compliance.— Where property owner within 100 feet of property to be rezoned did not receive notice of public hearing by mail, as required by this section, but had actual notice of the hearing, property owner was properly notified and this constituted substantial compliance with the statute.Hawthorne v. City of Santa Fe, 1975-NMSC-033, 88 N.M. 123, 537 P.2d 1385.\n\nApplicability of notice provisions.— The appropriate notice for a new, comprehensive zoning ordinance that distributes its impact over an entire community is notice by publication, as set forth in 3-21-14 NMSA 1978, rather than the individualized notice set forth in this section for zoning changes directly affecting relatively small numbers of people.Miles v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1998-NMCA-118, 125 N.M. 608, 964 P.2d 169, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 107, 967 P.2d 447.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Existing Legislation and Proposed Model Flood Plain Ordinance for New Mexico Municipalities,\" see 9 Nat.

      "text": "A. The zoning authority shall provide by resolution the procedure to be followed in considering appeals allowed by this section.\n\nB. Any aggrieved person or any officer, department, board or bureau of the zoning authority affected by a decision of an administrative officer, commission or committee in the enforcement of Sections 3-21-1 through 3-21-14 NMSA 1978 or ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation adopted pursuant to these sections may appeal to the zoning authority. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed unless the officer, commission or committee from whom the appeal is taken certifies that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril of life or property. Upon certification, the proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of district court after notice to the official, commission or committee from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.\n\nC. When an appeal alleges that there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination by an administrative official, commission or committee in the enforcement of Sections 3-21-1 through 3-21-14 NMSA 1978 or any ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation adopted pursuant to these sections, the zoning authority by a majority vote of all its members may:\n\n(1) authorize, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, variances or special exceptions from the terms of the zoning ordinance or resolution:\n\n(a) that are not contrary to the public interest;\n\n(b) where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the zoning ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship;\n\n(c) so that the spirit of the zoning ordinance is observed and substantial justice done; and\n\n(d) so that the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan are implemented; or\n\n(2) in conformity with Sections 3-21-1 through 3-21-14 NMSA 1978:\n\n(a) reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of an administrative official, commission or committee;\n\n(b) decide in favor of the appellant; or\n\n(c) make any change in any order, requirement, decision or determination of an administrative official, commission or committee.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-20-6, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300; 1979, ch. 256, § 1; 1983, ch. 160, § 1; 2008, ch. 64, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For procedures governing administrative appeals to the district court,seeRule 1-074 NMRA.\n\nFor scope of review of the district court,seeZamora v. Vill. of Ruidoso Downs, 120 N.M. 778, 907 P.2d 182 (1995).\n\nThe 2008 amendment,effective May 14, 2008, in Subsection C(1), authorized special exceptions during appeals and added Subsection C(1)(d).\n\nDue process.— Administrative hearings in zoning cases are quasi judicial hearings in which the administrative body must adhere to such requisite procedural protections as the particular situation demands. At a minimum, witnesses must be sworn and subject to cross-examination.State ex rel. Battershell v. City of Albuquerque, 1989-NMCA-045, 108 N.M. 658, 777 P.2d 386.\n\n\"Aggrieved person\" defined.— To be aggrieved, a party must have a personal or pecuniary interest or property right adversely affected by the judgment. The party's interest must be an immediate, pecuniary and substantial consequence of the judgment, not merely nominal or remote.Webb v. Fox, 1987-NMCA-050, 105 N.M. 723, 737 P.2d 82.\n\nA zoning applicant who possesses a recognizable right or interest in the property is an aggrieved person with standing to appeal.Webb v. Fox, 1987-NMCA-050, 105 N.M. 723, 737 P.2d 82.\n\nZoning commission's denial of rezoning petition constituted a \"decision\"for purposes of appeal to the city commission.Corondoni v. City of Albuquerque, 1963-NMSC-146, 72 N.M. 422, 384 P.2d 691.\n\nAvailability of injunctive relief.— Injunctive relief is not available to appeal a zoning decision when there is an adequate remedy at law, such as the method provided for appealing a zoning decision under Subsection B of this section and 3-21-9A NMSA 1978.State ex rel. Baxter v. Egolf, 1988-NMCA-047, 107 N.M. 315, 757 P.2d 371.\n\nSpecial exceptions are part of comprehensive plan.— A county ordinance which among other things establishes certain limited special exceptions is an integral part of the plan required under 3-21-5 NMSA 1978, and the main objectives of requiring that a special permit be obtained before a use of land is commenced are to protect adjoining property and to insure the orderly and efficient development of the community.Burroughs v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1975-NMSC-051, 88 N.M. 303, 540 P.2d 233.\n\n\"Special exception,\" \"special permit\" and \"use permitted subject to administrative approval\" are qualitatively the same,each involving the use which is permitted rather than proscribed by the zoning regulations.Burroughs v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1975-NMSC-051, 88 N.M. 303, 540 P.2d 233.\n\nExceptions and variances distinguished.— Exceptions may be treated as a legislative process or the exercise of a legislative function, the conditions for which must be found in the zoning ordinance and may not be varied, while variances may be treated as an exercise of the judicial function, whereby literal enforcement of ordinances may be disregarded. A variance is authority extended to the owner to use his property in a manner forbidden by the zoning enactment, while an exception allows him to put his property to a use which the enactment expressly permits. While exceptions are allowable to serve the general good and welfare rather than individual interests merely, a variance is a relaxation of an ordinance to alleviate conditions peculiar to particular property.Burroughs v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1975-NMSC-051, 88 N.M. 303, 540 P.2d 233.\n\nA city council has broad statutory authority to grant a variance.Downtown Neighborhoods Ass'n v. City of Albuquerque, 1989-NMCA-091, 109 N.M. 186, 783 P.2d 962.\n\n\"Unnecessary hardship\",which has been given special meaning by courts considering a zoning authority's power to grant a variance, ordinarily refers to circumstances in which no reasonable use can otherwise be made of the land. The exact showing necessary to prove unnecessary hardship varies from case to case, and a city council must make the initial determination by considering all of the relevant circumstances. However, it is clear that a showing that the owner might receive a greater profit if the variance is granted is not sufficient justification in itself for a variance.Downtown Neighborhoods Ass'n v. City of Albuquerque, 1989-NMCA-091, 109 N.M. 186, 783 P.2d 962.\n\nHistorical designation does not create unnecessary hardship.— Designation of a house as historically significant does not in and of itself answer the ultimate question of unnecessary hardship.Downtown Neighborhoods Ass'n v. City of Albuquerque, 1989-NMCA-091, 109 N.M. 186, 783 P.2d 962.\n\nCities have power to impose reasonable conditions on variances.Singleterry v. City of Albuquerque, 1981-NMSC-037, 96 N.M. 468, 632 P.2d 345.\n\nOrdinance may be more restrictive.— Although the statutory requirements for authorizing variances listed in Subsection C are less restrictive than those under the ordinance, no preemption occurs unless the ordinance requirements conflict with the statute.Gould v. Santa Fe County, 2001-NMCA-107, 131 N.M. 405, 37 P.3d 122.\n\nCities may require violation of restrictive covenant.— In its power to attach reasonable conditions to grants of variances, a zoning authority may require a landowner to fulfill a condition which would violate a restrictive covenant.Singleterry v. City of Albuquerque, 1981-NMSC-037, 96 N.M. 468, 632 P.2d 345.\n\nAuthority of air quality control board to issue special use permits.— There can be no doubt of a county air quality control board's authority to entertain applications for special use permits, and to issue or withhold them after consideration.McCabe v. Hawk, 1982-NMCA-039, 97 N.M. 622, 642 P.2d 608, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nAuthorizing overnight campground in agricultural zone held improper.— The granting of a special use permit to landowner by the county commissioners, authorizing the construction and maintenance of an overnight campground in an A-2 rural agricultural zone, was an improper exercise of power, since such a use was not permitted under the ordinance passed pursuant to this section, and the commissioners had no authority under the specific provisions of the ordinance to issue this special use permit.Burroughs v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1975-NMSC-051, 88 N.M. 303, 540 P.2d 233.\n\nOvernight campgrounds not included in trailer court.— Where a county ordinance passed pursuant to this section authorizes special use permits for trailer courts, the supreme court could not discern an intention in the ordinance to include overnight campgrounds in the category of \"trailer court.\"Burroughs v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1975-NMSC-051, 88 N.M. 303, 540 P.2d 233.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"County Regulation of Land Use and Development,\" see 9 Nat.

Extraterritorial Land Use Authority, 2001-NMCA-013, 130 N.M. 195, 22 P.3d 220, cert. denied, 130 N.M. 558, 28 P.3d 1099 (2001).\n\nZoning commission's denial of rezoning petition constituted a \"decision\"for purposes of appeal to the city commission; consequently, the district court had jurisdiction to review by certiorari the denial of rezoning petition by city commission sitting for the purpose of hearing and deciding appeals.Corondoni v. City of Albuquerque, 1963-NMSC-146, 72 N.M. 422, 384 P.2d 691.\n\nChallenge of decision of neighboring city.— A town had standing as a \"person aggrieved\" to challenge the zoning decision of a neighboring city.Town of Mesilla v.

Incorporated Cnty. of Los Alamos, 1986-NMSC-063, 104 N.M. 571, 725 P.2d 250.\n\nApplicant for variance indispensable party.— Under this section and Rule 1-065 D(2) NMRA, where the party bringing the appeal seeks to overturn a decision authorizing a zoning variance, the applicant for the variance is an indispensable or necessary party.State ex rel. Sweet v. Village of Jemez Springs, Inc., 1992-NMCA-085, 114 N.M. 297, 837 P.2d 1380.\n\nIndispensable party added after expiration of filing deadline.— Where an indispensable or necessary party is subject to service of process and is otherwise capable of being joined as a party to a proceeding under this section challenging the issuance of a zoning variance, the district court has jurisdiction to add such party to the proceeding after the time to file the petition has expired.State ex rel. Sweet v. Village of Jemez Springs, Inc., 1992-NMCA-085, 114 N.M. 297, 837 P.2d 1380.\n\n\"Present\" defined.— The term \"present,\" as used in Subsection A only requires filing with the clerk of the court.Butcher v. City of Albuquerque, 1980-NMSC-127, 95 N.M. 242, 620 P.2d 1267 (decided under prior law).\n\nPetition need not be personally presented to district judgewithin the 30-day period to comply with this section.Butcher v.

City of Santa Fe, 1983-NMSC-031, 99 N.M. 505, 660 P.2d 595.\n\nJudicial review may be obtained by both petitions for review and certiorari.— This section does not restrict an appellant to seeking a writ of certiorari as the only appropriate procedure for obtaining judicial review, but gives the district court jurisdiction to hear both petitions for review and writs of certiorari.Mitchell v. City of Santa Fe, 1983-NMSC-031, 99 N.M. 505, 660 P.2d 595 (decided under prior law).\n\nAvailability of injunctive relief.— Injunctive relief is not available to appeal a zoning decision when there is an adequate remedy at law, such as the method provided for appealing a zoning decision under Subsection A of this section and 3-21-8B NMSA 1978.State ex rel. Baxter v. Egolf, 1988-NMCA-047, 107 N.M. 315, 757 P.2d 371 (decided under prior law).\n\nStandard for judicial review.— After the enactment of 39-3-1.1 NMSA 1978, the standard of review for the court of appeals upon the review of a district court decision of an appeal from an administrative agency is based upon the criteria for a writ of certiorari as outlined in Rule 12-505 NMRA, and no longer may the court of appeals review the district court decision under the administrative standard.C.F.T. Dev., LLC v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 2001-NMCA-069, 130 N.M. 775, 32 P.3d 784.\n\nThe questions to be answered by a district court in reviewing the decisions of a zoning authority are questions of law, restricted to whether the administrative body acted fraudulently, arbitrarily or capriciously, whether the order was supported by substantial evidence and, generally, whether the action of the administrative body was within the scope of its authority; the district court may not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative body.Singleterry v. City of Albuquerque, 1981-NMSC-037, 96 N.M. 468, 632 P.2d 345.\n\nJudicial review of a zoning authority's decision is limited to questions of law. By statute, the district court must determine initially whether the decision is illegal, in whole or in part, and an appellate court conducts the same review as the district court. That determination depends upon whether the zoning authority acts fraudulently, arbitrarily, or capriciously; whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence; and whether the zoning authority acted within the scope of its authority.Downtown Neighborhoods Ass'n v. City of Albuquerque, 1989-NMCA-091, 109 N.M. 186, 783 P.2d 962.\n\nIn New Mexico, zoning decisions involving the application of a general rule to a specific property are not legislative acts; rather, they are deemed to be quasi-judicial in nature. Because the zoning actions are quasi-judicial, the administrative standard of review is applied. The decision is affirmed if it is supported by the applicable law and by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.West Old Town Neighborhood Ass'n v. City of Albuquerque, 1996-NMCA-107, 122 N.M. 495, 927 P.2d 529,overruled on other grounds by C.F.T. Dev., LLC v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 2001-NMCA-069, 130 N.M.775, 32 P.3d 784 (decided under prior law).\n\nConstitutionality of section.— To the extent that this section purports to allow the district court to zone land, it is void as an unconstitutional delegation of power to the judiciary, contravening N.M. Const., art. III, § 1.Coe v. City of Albuquerque, 1966-NMSC-196, 76 N.M. 771, 418 P.2d 545 (decided under prior law).\n\nCourt order for rezoning unconstitutional.— The district court is not permitted to overturn a rejection of a petition for a zoning change and then order the city to rezone; such an order violates constitutional separation of powers, since zoning is a legislative activity.Hart v. City of Albuquerque, 1999-NMCA-043, 126 N.M. 366, 975 P.2d 366.\n\nCollateral attack held permissible.— Since this section does not present the exclusive method for attacking invalid ordinances, the supreme court held that a collateral attack upon an ordinance which was void in the sense that the legislative body had no constitutional or statutory power to pass it or because the ordinance was never legally enacted was permissible.Dale J. Bellamah Corp. v. City of Santa Fe, 1975-NMSC-045, 88 N.M. 288, 540 P.2d 218;Mechem v. City of Santa Fe, 1981-NMSC-104, 96 N.M. 668, 634 P.2d 690.\n\nPresumption of correctness of original zoning.— Absent a showing that the original zoning was mistakenly listed as a different zone than that intended due to clerical error, oversight or misapprehension of the facts, the original zoning is deemed to be correct.Davis v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-070, 98 N.M. 319, 648 P.2d 777.\n\nZoning authority's decision upheld.— Zoning authority's decision was within the scope of its authority, supported by substantial evidence, and reasonable.Hyde v. Taos Municipal-County Zoning Auth., 1991-NMCA-114, 113 N.M. 29, 822 P.2d 126.\n\nThirty-days' requirement of Subsection A will be strictly interpreted.Bolin v. City of Portales, 1976-NMSC-020, 89 N.M. 192, 548 P.2d 1210 (decided under prior law).\n\nTolling of time to appeal.— Where the developer sought review in federal court of the municipality's denial of the developer's preliminary plat within twenty-eight days after the municipality issued its final decision; while the developer's federal action was pending, the municipality filed an action in state district court to quiet title to the land; and after the federal court dismissed the federal action, the developer timely filed a counterclaim against the municipality in the state district court action to review the municipality's action denying the preliminary plat, the federal action tolled the limitations period to appeal and the developer's appeal for review in state district court was timely.City of Rio Rancho v. Amrep Sw., Inc., 2011-NMSC-037, 260 P.3d 414,aff'g in part and rev'g in part, 2010-NMCA-075, 148 N.M. 542, 238 P.3d 911.\n\nThirty-day time limit to appeal not extended by civil rules.— Rule 1-015C, governing the relation back of amended pleadings, cannot be construed to extend the 30-day time limit of this section for appeal from a decision of the zoning authority.Citizens for Los Alamos, Inc. v. Incorporated Cnty. of Los Alamos, 1986-NMSC-063, 104 N.M. 571, 725 P.2d 250 (decided under prior law).\n\nTriggering date for 30-day period.— The date from which a city council's decision triggers the 30-day period under this section is the date of the council's final decision, the date the zoning ordinance or plan is passed.Ramirez v. City of Santa Fe, 1993-NMCA-049, 115 N.M. 417, 852 P.2d 690 (decided under prior law).\n\nPetition filed too late.— An ordinance of the board of county commissioners changing the zoning of a certain tract from A-1 to M-1 became final on the date it was passed, adopted, approved and signed by the board, as reflected in the unchallenged return to petitioner's petition for a writ of certiorari, and not on the date some six weeks later when the board approved the minutes of the former meeting; the minutes were only a record of the actions taken. Therefore, petitioners who filed their petition for a writ of certiorari under this section on June 4 filed too late where according to the copy of the ordinance filed with the return to the writ the board of county commissioner's zoning decision was made on April 16, despite the fact that the board did not approve until May 21 the minutes of the meeting of April 16.Serna v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1975-NMSC-049, 88 N.M. 282, 540 P.2d 212 (decided under prior law).\n\nReview is limited to the record presented.Peace Found., Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1966-NMSC-195, 76 N.M. 757, 418 P.2d 535.\n\nSince portions of the record were not available to be certified to the court,the court accordingly took proof in connection with such omissions as per the procedure for review as set forth in this section.Krutzner Corp. v. City of Las Vegas, 1970-NMSC-052, 81 N.M. 359, 467 P.2d 25 (decided under prior law).\n\nRules for construing zoning ordinances.— In construing municipal or county zoning ordinances, the same rules of construction are used as when construing statutes of the legislature. One of these rules of construction is to interpret the statute or ordinance to mean what the legislature intended it to mean, and to accomplish the ends sought to be accomplished by it. Another rule of construction is that the entire act or ordinance is to be read as a whole and each part construed in connection with every other part so as to produce a harmonious whole. Still another rule is that the court will not read into a statute or ordinance language which is not there, particularly if it makes sense as written.Burroughs v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1975-NMSC-051, 88 N.M. 303, 540 P.2d 233.\n\nShowing required to rezone to more restrictive zoning.— In comprehensive rezonings, where the zoning of extensive geographic areas is changed by zoning authorities after full public consideration, anyone seeking to rezone property to a more restrictive zoning must show that either there was a mistake in the original zoning or that a substantial change has occurred in the character of the neighborhood since the original zoning to such an extent that the reclassification or change ought to be made.Davis v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-070, 98 N.M. 319, 648 P.2d 777.\n\nAm.
