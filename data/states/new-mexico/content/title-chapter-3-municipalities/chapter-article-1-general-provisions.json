Nothing in this section shall preclude a person with a disability or an illiterate person from causing another person to sign a petition on a person with a disability's or an illiterate person's behalf, so long as the person signing for the person with a disability or illiterate person executes an affidavit acknowledged before a notary public that the person is authorized to sign the petition for the person with a disability or illiterate person. In order for the signature on behalf of the person with a disability or illiterate person to be counted and not purged, the original affidavit shall be submitted along with the petition containing the signature on behalf of the illiterate person or person with a disability.\n\nJ.

Upon a prima facie showing by the petitioner of the right to have that person's signature included upon the petition, the district court shall issue an order to the municipal clerk, county clerk, governing body or board of county commissioners to require reinstatement of the signature of the petitioner;\n\n(3) within ten days after receiving the order of the district court, the municipal clerk, county clerk, governing body or board of county commissioners shall reinstate the signature of the petitioner on the petition or show cause why the signature of the petitioner has not been reinstated. Upon hearing, if the district court finds that the person whose signature has been purged meets the qualifications for signing the petition, the district court shall make final its order of reinstatement to the municipal clerk, county clerk, governing body or board of county commissioners; and\n\n(4) if a sufficient number of signatures are reinstated by the clerk, the district court or both to make the petition valid, then the reinstatement by the clerk or the district court, whichever occurs last, shall be deemed the date of certification of the validity of the petition for the purposes of adopting election resolutions, calling elections or for other matters as provided in the Municipal Code or otherwise provided by law.\n\nM. Any petition that contains an insufficient number of signatures after all signatures have been reinstated pursuant to Subsection L of this section is invalid.\n\nN.

When a petition governed by this section is required to be filed with the county clerk or board of county commissioners, the board of county commissioners or county clerk shall perform or cause to be performed the duties required under this section, except as otherwise prohibited by law.\n\nO. Any person or any municipal or county official knowingly violating the provisions of this section, knowingly providing or causing to be provided any false information on a petition or forging a signature or otherwise signing a petition when that person knows the person is not a qualified elector in the municipality is guilty of a fourth degree felony.\n\nP.
