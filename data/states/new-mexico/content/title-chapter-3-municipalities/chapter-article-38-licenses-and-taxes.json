      "heading": "Licensing; business activities",
      "text": "The governing body may declare, by ordinance, that the licensing or regulation of a business not otherwise exempt by law is conducive to the promotion of the health and general welfare of the municipality and may impose a license fee on and require a separate license for each place of business conducted by the same person, firm, corporation or association. The license fee shall bear a reasonable relation to the regulation of the business.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-37-1, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300; 1981, ch. 37, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For the Construction Industries Licensing Act,see60-13-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor licenses for jewelry auctions,see61-16-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nOrdinance will not be upheld merely because of its declared purpose.— Even though the declared purpose of an ordinance is for the exercise of the police power, the whole act will be examined to ascertain its characteristics and to determine whether there is actually an exercise of that power. It will not be upheld merely because of its declared purpose.City of Lovington v. Hall, 1961-NMSC-021, 68 N.M. 143, 359 P.2d 769.\n\nDeclared purpose is to be given considerationin aid of interpreting the purpose, reason or occasion for the ordinance.City of Lovington v. Hall, 1961-NMSC-021, 68 N.M. 143, 359 P.2d 769.\n\nCity cannot bargain away its police power for license fees,nor divest itself of its duty of preserving public health, by licensing a business which endangers the public health.Mitchell v. City of Roswell, 1941-NMSC-007, 45 N.M. 92, 111 P.2d 41.\n\nBusinesses subject to licensing.— Cities are authorized to fix and collect a license fee on cleaning, pressing and tailoring shops, welding shops and machine shops within their limits, as a police or regulatory measure.Tharp v. City of Clovis, 1929-NMSC-046, 34 N.M. 161, 279 P. 69.\n\nPower to license.— Cities and towns could, under their police power, license and regulate the occupation of dray, transfer, taxicab and storage warehouses.Daniel v. City of Clovis, 1929-NMSC-061, 34 N.M. 239, 280 P. 260.\n\nExtent of license fee.— Municipality has power to charge a license fee which does not exceed the probable expense of issuing the license and of regulating the business.City of Lovington v. Hall, 1961-NMSC-021, 68 N.M. 143, 359 P.2d 769.\n\nMere fact that license fees produce some excess revenuedoes not render the ordinance invalid, but the fees must be \"incidental to regulation and not primarily for the purpose of producing revenue.\"City of Lovington v. Hall, 1961-NMSC-021, 68 N.M. 143, 359 P.2d 769.\n\nDeclaration of purpose required.— There is expressed a legislative intent to allow municipalities to license and regulate provided the governing body shall by ordinance declare that the licensing and regulation is conducive to the promotion of the health and general welfare of the community. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6096.\n\nPhrase \"not otherwise exempt by law\" in this section refersboth to the exemptions from licensing and regulation created by the Construction Industries Licensing Act, those created by the Private Investigators' Act and possibly to other statutory exemptions. Section 3-38-3 NMSA 1978 covers occupations the municipality does not seek to regulate under this section. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-72.\n\nContractors exempt.— The right of a municipality to both license and regulate resident and nonresident contractors has been taken away by the comprehensive nature of the Construction Industries Licensing Act except in certain minor respects. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-72.\n\nEffect of revenue production.— The purpose of an ordinance under this section must be to charge license fees to defray the cost of regulation, and any license fee charged primarily to produce revenue would render the ordinance void. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-72.\n\nSome revenue produced by licensing under this section will not, of itself, render the ordinance void. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-72.\n\nEffect of repealing counties' specific statutory authority.— The repeal of the specific statutory authority of counties to impose license fees and occupational taxes (7-22-1 to 7-22-14 NMSA 1978) would not implicitly repeal a county's authority to exercise those powers pursuant to the statutes governing municipalities since repeals by implication are not favored. The 1979 repeal of 7-22-1 to 7-22-14 NMSA 1978, without a clear expression of legislative intent to limit the authority of counties, would not prevent a county from imposing fees and taxes under this section and 3-38-3 NMSA 1978, but a county would have no more authority in this regard than would a municipality, and the restrictions of this section and 3-38-3 NMSA 1978 would apply. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-09 (decided prior to 1981 repeal and reenactment of 3-38-3 NMSA 1978).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 51 Am. Jur. 2d Licenses and Permits §§ 4 to 38; 56 Am.
