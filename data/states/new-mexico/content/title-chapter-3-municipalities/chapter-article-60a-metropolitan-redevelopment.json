It is found and declared that there exist in the state slum areas and blighted areas that constitute a serious and growing menace, injurious to the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the state; that the existence of these areas contributes substantially to the spread of disease and crime, constitutes an economic and social burden, substantially impairs or arrests the sound and orderly development of many areas of the state and retards the maintenance and expansion of necessary housing accommodations; that economic and commercial activities are lessened in those areas by the slum or blighted conditions, and the effects of these conditions include less employment in the area, lower property values, less gross receipts tax revenue and reduced use of buildings, residential dwellings and other facilities in the area; that the prevention and elimination of slum areas and blighted areas and the prevention and elimination of conditions that impair sound and orderly development is a matter of state policy and concern in order that the state shall not continue to be endangered by these areas that contribute little to the tax income of the state and its local governments and that consume an excessive proportion of its revenues because of the extra services required for police, fire, accident, hospitalization or other forms of public protection, services and facilities.\n\nB. Certain slum areas and blighted areas or portions thereof may require land acquisition and clearance by local government, since prevailing conditions may make impracticable their reclamation or development; other areas or portions of the slum or blighted area may be suitable for conservation or rehabilitation efforts and the conditions and evils enumerated in Subsection A of this section may be eliminated, remedied or prevented by those efforts; and to the extent feasible, salvageable slum and blighted areas should be conserved and rehabilitated through voluntary action and the regulatory process and, when necessary, by government assistance.\n\nC. The powers conferred by the Metropolitan Redevelopment Code [Chapter 3, Article 60A NMSA 1978] regarding the use of public money are for public uses or purposes for which public money may be expended. The individual benefits accruing to persons as the result of the powers conferred by the Metropolitan Redevelopment Code and projects conducted in accordance with its provisions are found and declared to be incidental to the objectives of that code and are far outweighed by the benefit to the public as a whole. Activities authorized and powers granted by the Metropolitan Redevelopment Code are hereby declared not to result in a donation or aid to any person, association or public or private organization or enterprise. The necessity for these provisions and the power is declared to be in the public interest as a matter of legislative determination.\n\nHistory:Laws 1979, ch. 391, § 2; 2007, ch. 329, § 3; 2007, ch. 330, § 3; 2018, ch. 60, § 2.\n\nThe 2018 amendment,effective May 16, 2018, expanded the purpose of the Metropolitan Redevelopment Code to include counties within its scope, and made technical changes throughout the section; replaced \"municipality\" and \"municipalities\" with \"local government\" throughout the section; and deleted Subsection D, which related to problems within large metropolitan areas.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, eliminated the provision in Subsection C that the powers conferred are for public purposes for which the power of eminent domain may be exercised.\n\nLaws 2007, ch. 329, § 3 enacted identical amendments to this section.

It is the intent of the legislature by the passage of the Metropolitan Redevelopment Code [Chapter 3, Article 60A NMSA 1978] to authorize local governments to acquire, own, lease, improve and dispose of properties in a designated metropolitan redevelopment area to the end that such local governments may be able to promote industry and develop trade or other economic activity by inducing profit or nonprofit corporations, federal governmental offices, hospitals and manufacturing, industrial, commercial or business enterprises to locate, expand or remain in such area, to mitigate the serious threat of extensive unemployment in a metropolitan redevelopment area and to secure and maintain a balanced and stable economy in an area declared to be a slum or blighted area.\n\nB. It is the further intent of the legislature to authorize local governments to acquire, own, lease, improve and dispose of properties so that adequate medical care, residential housing and facilities for the disposal of sewage and solid waste may be provided; and industrial, manufacturing, commercial or business activities may be begun or expanded in these areas; furnishing water, energy and gas may be provided; more adequate facilities for sports events and activities and recreation activities, conventions and trade shows may be provided; more parking facilities or storage or training facilities may be provided; and more adequate research, product-testing and administrative facilities may be provided, all of which promote the public health, welfare, safety, convenience and prosperity.\n\nC. It is, therefore, the intention of the legislature to vest local governments with all powers, other than the power of eminent domain, that may be necessary to enable them to accomplish such purposes, which powers shall in all respects be exercised for the benefit of the inhabitants of this state and within the jurisdiction of the local governments of the state for the promotion of their health, safety, welfare, convenience and prosperity.\n\nD. It is not intended by the Metropolitan Redevelopment Code to authorize any local government to operate any manufacturing, industrial, commercial or business enterprise or any research, product-testing or administrative facilities of such enterprise. Nor is it the intent of that code to prohibit the operation of residential housing facilities, health care facilities, sewage or solid waste disposal facilities or the furnishing of water, sports or recreation facilities, convention or trade show facilities, airports, public transportation facilities or operations, parking facilities or storage or training facilities by any local government.\n\nHistory:Laws 1979, ch. 391, § 3; 2007, ch. 329, § 4; 2007, ch. 330, § 4; 2018, ch. 60, § 3.\n\nThe 2018 amendment,effective May 16, 2018, included counties within the scope of the Metropolitan Redevelopment Code; replaced \"municipality\" and \"municipalities\" with \"local government\" or \"local governments\" throughout the section.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, excluded the power of eminent domain in Subsection C.",

The metropolitan redevelopment agency shall not transact any business or exercise any powers until the local government has adopted an ordinance creating a metropolitan redevelopment agency and has specified the powers and duties of the agency.\n\nB. When the metropolitan redevelopment agency has been authorized to transact business and exercise powers, the mayor or manager of the local government, with the advice and consent of the local government, shall appoint a board of commissioners of the redevelopment agency, which shall consist of five commissioners. The commissioners shall be initially appointed to serve staggered terms as follows from the date of their appointment:\n\n(1) two members for three-year terms;\n\n(2) two members for two-year terms; and\n\n(3) one member for a one-year term. Thereafter, commissioners shall be appointed for terms of five years each.\n\nC. A commissioner shall receive no compensation for services but shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including traveling expenses, incurred in the discharge of the commissioner's duties. Each commissioner shall hold office until the commissioner's successor has been appointed and qualified. A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the clerk of the local government, and the certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of the commissioner. A commissioner may be removed from office at any time by the mayor or manager of the local government.\n\nD. The powers of a metropolitan redevelopment agency shall be exercised by the commissioners. A majority of the appointed commissioners constitutes a quorum for the purpose of conducting business and exercising the powers of the agency and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by the agency upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present at a lawful meeting, unless the bylaws require a larger number. Any person may be appointed as commissioner if the person resides within the area of operation of the agency, which shall be coterminous with the area of operation of the local government, and is otherwise eligible for appointment under the Redevelopment Law [3-60A-5 to 3-60A-18 NMSA 1978].\n\nE. The mayor or manager of the local government shall designate a chair and vice chair from among the commissioners. The commission may employ and determine the qualifications, duties and compensation of an executive director, technical experts and other agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as the metropolitan redevelopment agency may require. For legal services as the agency may require, the commission may employ or retain for the agency legal counsel and a legal staff. A metropolitan redevelopment agency shall file annually with the local government a report of its activities for the preceding fiscal year, which report shall include a complete financial statement setting forth its assets, liabilities, income and operating expenses as of the end of the fiscal year.\n\nHistory:Laws 1979, ch. 391, § 16; 2018, ch. 60, § 15.\n\nThe 2018 amendment,effective May 16, 2018, extended the powers and duties as identified in the Metropolitan Redevelopment Code from only municipalities to now include counties; replaced \"municipality\" and \"governing body\" with \"local government\" throughout the section; in Subsection B, in the introductory paragraph, after \"mayor\", added \"or manager of the local government\"; in Subsection C, after \"mayor\", added \"or manager of the local government\"; and in Subsection E, after \"mayor\", added \"or manager of the local government\".\n\nAm.

The procedures to be used in determining a property tax increment are:\n\n(1) the local government shall, after approval of a metropolitan redevelopment plan, notify the county assessor of the taxable parcels of property within the metropolitan redevelopment area;\n\n(2) upon receipt of the notification, the county assessor shall identify the parcels of property within the metropolitan redevelopment area within their respective jurisdictions and certify to the county treasurer the net taxable value of the property at the time of notification as the base value for the distribution of property tax revenues authorized by the Property Tax Code [Articles 35 through 38 of Chapter 7 NMSA 1978]. If because of acquisition by the local government the property becomes tax exempt, the county assessor shall note that fact on their respective records and so notify the county treasurer, but the county assessor and the county treasurer shall preserve a record of the net taxable value at the time of inclusion of the property within the metropolitan redevelopment area as the base value for the purpose of distribution of property tax revenues when the parcel again becomes taxable. The county assessor is not required by this section to preserve the new taxable value at the time of inclusion of the property within the metropolitan redevelopment area as the base value for the purposes of valuation of the property;\n\n(3) if because of acquisition by the local government the property becomes tax exempt, when the parcel again becomes taxable, the local government shall notify the county assessor of the parcels of property that because of their rehabilitation or other improvement are to be revalued for property tax purposes. A new taxable value of this property shall then be determined by the county assessor. If no acquisition by the local government occurs, improvement or rehabilitation of property subject to valuation by the assessor shall be reported to the assessor as required by the Property Tax Code, and the new taxable value shall be determined as of January 1 of the tax year following the year in which the improvement or rehabilitation is completed; and\n\n(4) current tax rates shall then be applied to the new taxable value of property included in the metropolitan redevelopment area. The amount by which the revenue received exceeds that which would have been received by application of the same rates to the base value before inclusion in the metropolitan redevelopment area shall be multiplied by the percentage of the increment dedicated by the local government pursuant to Section 3-60A-23 NMSA 1978, credited to the local government and deposited in the metropolitan redevelopment fund. This transfer shall take place only after the county treasurer has been notified to apply the procedures pursuant to this subsection to property included in a metropolitan redevelopment area. Unless the entire metropolitan redevelopment area is specifically included by the local government for purposes of tax increment financing, the payment by the county treasurer to the local government shall be limited to those properties specifically included. The remaining revenue shall be distributed to participating units of government as authorized by the Property Tax Code.\n\nB. The procedures to be used in determining a gross receipts tax increment are:\n\n(1) the local government shall notify the taxation and revenue department of the geographic boundaries of the metropolitan redevelopment area;\n\n(2) by the January 1 or July 1 following at least ninety days after receipt of the notice of the geographic boundaries, the taxation and revenue department shall designate a reporting location code for the metropolitan redevelopment area pursuant to Section 7-1-14 NMSA 1978;\n\n(3) using data from the twelve months of reporting periods following designation of the reporting location code, the taxation and revenue department shall calculate the gross receipts tax revenue for the base year as follows:\n\n(a) the amount of the local government's local option gross receipts tax revenue attributable to the gross receipts sourced to the metropolitan redevelopment area pursuant to Section 7-1-14 NMSA 1978 in the previous twelve months; and\n\n(b) the amount of state gross receipts tax revenue attributable to gross receipts sourced to the metropolitan redevelopment area pursuant to Section 7-1-14 NMSA 1978 in the previous twelve months, less any amount distributed to the municipality pursuant to Section 7-1-6.4 NMSA 1978 attributable to gross receipts sourced to the metropolitan redevelopment area; and\n\n(4) following making the calculation of the gross receipts tax revenue for the base year:\n\n(a) the taxation and revenue department shall compare the amounts of gross receipts tax revenues of the base year with the amounts of gross receipts tax revenues of that following twelve months, using the same calculation methods as provided in Paragraph (3) of this subsection; and\n\n(b) if there is an increase between the gross receipts tax revenue of the base year and the gross receipts tax revenue of that following twelve months, the taxation and revenue department shall distribute, pursuant to Section 7-1-6.71 NMSA 1978, the sum of: 1) the product of the total rate of the local government's local option gross receipts tax multiplied by the increased amount of the local government's local option gross receipts tax revenue, further multiplied by the percentage of the gross receipts tax increment dedicated by the local government pursuant to Section 3-60A-23 NMSA 1978; plus 2) the product of the state gross receipts tax rate multiplied by the increased amount of the state gross receipts tax revenue, further multiplied by the percentage of the gross receipts tax increment dedicated by the state board of finance pursuant to Section 3-60A-23 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. The procedures specified in this section shall be followed annually for a maximum period of twenty years following the date of notification provided by this section.\n\nD. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"local option gross receipts tax revenue\" means revenue transferred to the local government pursuant to Section 7-1-6.12 or 7-1-6.13 NMSA 1978, as appropriate; and\n\n(2) \"state gross receipts tax revenue\" means revenue received from the gross receipts tax imposed pursuant to Section 7-9-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:Laws 1979, ch. 391, § 21; 1987, ch. 316, § 1; 2000, ch. 103, § 2; 2018, ch. 60, § 20; 2023, ch. 112, § 4; 2024, ch. 62, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 2024, ch. 62, § 3 changed the effective date of Laws 2023, ch. 112 from July 1, 2024 to January 1, 2025.\n\nThe 2024 amendment,effective January 1, 2025, revised procedures for determining gross receipts tax increments used to fund metropolitan redevelopment projects; in Subsection B, deleted former Paragraphs B(1) and B(2), added new Paragraphs B(1), B(2), and B(3), in Subparagraph B(3)(a), after \"attributable to the gross receipts\", deleted \"of persons engaging in business in\" and added \"sourced to\", after \"metropolitan redevelopment area\", added \"pursuant to Section 7-1-14 NMSA 1978\", and deleted \"fiscal year, less any local option gross receipts tax revenue attributable to construction activities located within the metropolitan redevelopment area\" and added \"twelve months\", in Subparagraph B(3)(b), after the first occurrence of \"attributable to gross receipts\", deleted \"of person engaging in business in\" and added \"sourced to\", after \"metropolitan redevelopment area\", added \"pursuant to Section 7-1-14 NMSA 1978\", after \"previous\", deleted \"fiscal year\" and added \"twelve months\", and deleted \"state gross receipts tax revenue attributable to construction activities located within the metropolitan redevelopment area and, if the local government is a municipality, any\", and after the second occurrence of \"attributable to gross receipts\", deleted \"of persons engaging in business in\" and added \"sourced to\", deleted \"within six months of the end of each fiscal year following\" and in Paragraph B(4), added \"following making the calculation of the gross receipts tax revenue for\", in Subparagraph B(4)(a), after \"following\", deleted \"fiscal year\" and added \"twelve months\", after \"Paragraph\", changed \"(2)\" to \"(3)\", and deleted \"except the amounts of gross receipts tax revenues of the following fiscal year shall include revenue attributable to construction activities located within the metropolitan redevelopment area\", and in Subparagraph B(4)(b), after \"following\", deleted \"fiscal year\" and added \"twelve months, the taxation and revenue department shall distribute, pursuant to Section 7-1-6.71 NMSA 1978\".\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective January 1, 2025, provided for the dedication of a portion of an increase in property tax revenue, local option gross receipts tax revenue and state gross receipts tax revenue to fund a metropolitan redevelopment project, and defined \"local option gross receipts tax revenue\" and \"state gross receipts tax revenue\"; in the section heading, added \"Property and gross receipts\", and redesignated former Subsections A through D as Paragraphs A(1) through A(4), respectively; in Subsection A, in the introductory clause, after \"used in\", added \"determining a property\", in Paragraph A(1), after \"notify the county assessor\", deleted \"and the taxation and revenue department\", and after \"within the\", deleted \"project\" and added \"metropolitan redevelopment area\", in Paragraph A(2), after \"notification\", deleted \"pursuant to Subsection A of this section\", and after each occurrence of \"county assessor\", deleted \"the taxation and revenue department\", in Paragraph A(3), after \"notify the county assessor\", deleted \"and the taxation and revenue department\", and after \"determined by the county assessor\", deleted \"or by the taxation and revenue department if the property is within the valuation jurisdiction of that department\", in Paragraph A(4), after \"taxable value\", added \"of property included in the metropolitan redevelopment area\", after \"shall be\", added \"multiplied by the percentage of the increment dedicated by the local government pursuant to Section 3-60A-23 NMSA 1978\", and after \"notified to apply the\", deleted \"tax increment method\" and added \"procedures pursuant to this subsection\"; added a new Subsection B and redesignated former Subsection E as Subsection C; in Subsection C, after \"notification\", deleted \"of inclusion of property as coming under the transfer provisions of\" and added \"provided\"; and added a new Subsection D.",

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds or notes shall be payable from and secured by a pledge of such revenues, and the local government shall irrevocably pledge all or part of the revenues to the payment of the bonds or notes. The revenues deposited in the metropolitan redevelopment fund or the designated part thereof may thereafter be used only for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds or notes, and a holder of the bonds or notes shall have a first lien against the revenues deposited in the metropolitan redevelopment fund or the designated part thereof for the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds or notes. To increase the security and marketability of the tax increment bonds or notes, the local government may:\n\n(1) create a lien for the benefit of the bondholders on any public improvements or public works used solely by the metropolitan redevelopment project or portion of a project financed by the bonds or notes, or on the revenues of such improvements or works;\n\n(2) provide that the proceeds from the sale of real and personal property acquired with the proceeds from the sale of bonds or notes issued pursuant to the Tax Increment Law [3-60A-19 to 3-60A-25 NMSA 1978] shall be deposited in the metropolitan redevelopment fund and used for the purposes of repayment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds or notes; and\n\n(3) make covenants and do any and all acts not inconsistent with law as may be necessary, convenient or desirable in order to additionally secure the bonds or notes or make the bonds or notes more marketable in the exercise of the discretion of the local government.\n\nB. Bonds and notes issued pursuant to this section shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction, shall not be general obligations of the local government, shall be collectible only from the proper pledged revenues and shall not be subject to the provisions of any other law or charter relating to the authorization, issuance or sale of tax increment bonds or tax increment bond anticipation notes. Bonds and notes issued pursuant to the Tax Increment Law are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and, together with interest thereon, shall be exempted from all taxes by the state.\n\nC. The bonds or notes shall be authorized by an ordinance of the local government; shall be in a denomination or denominations, bear a date and mature, in the case of bonds, at a time not exceeding twenty years from their date, and in the case of notes, not exceeding five years from the date of the original note; bear interest at a rate or have appreciated principal value not exceeding the maximum net effective interest rate permitted by the Public Securities Act [6-14-1 through 6-14-3 NMSA 1978]; and be in a form, carry registration privileges, be executed in a manner, be payable at a place within or without the state, be payable at intervals or at maturity and be subject to terms of redemption as the authorizing ordinance or supplemental resolution of the local government may provide.\n\nD. The bonds or notes may be sold in one or more series at, below or above par, at public or private sale, in a manner and for a price as the local government, in its discretion, shall determine; provided that the price at which the bonds or notes are sold shall not result in a net effective interest rate that exceeds the maximum permitted by the Public Securities Act. As an incidental expense of a metropolitan redevelopment project or the portion financed with the bonds or notes, the local government in its discretion may employ financial and legal consultants with regard to the financing of the project.\n\nE. In case any of the public officials of the local government whose signatures appear on any bonds or notes issued pursuant to the Tax Increment Law cease to be public officials before the delivery of the bonds or notes, the signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if the officials had remained in office until delivery. Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds or notes issued pursuant to the Tax Increment Law shall be fully negotiable.\n\nF. In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforceability of any bond or note issued pursuant to the Tax Increment Law or the security therefor, any bond or note reciting in substance that it has been issued by the local government in connection with a metropolitan redevelopment project shall be conclusively deemed to have been issued for that purpose and the project shall be conclusively deemed to have been planned, located and carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Metropolitan Redevelopment Code [Chapter 3, Article 60A NMSA 1978].\n\nG. The proceedings under which tax increment bonds or tax increment bond anticipation notes are authorized to be issued and any mortgage, deed of trust, trust indenture or other lien or security device on real and personal property given to secure the same may contain provisions customarily contained in instruments securing bonds and notes and constituting a covenant with the bondholders.\n\nH. A local government may issue bonds or notes pursuant to this section with the proceeds from the bonds or notes to be used as other money is authorized to be used in the Metropolitan Redevelopment Code.\n\nI. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this 2023 act, the local government shall have the power to issue renewal notes, to issue bonds to pay notes and, whenever it deems refunding expedient, to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether the bonds to be refunded have or have not matured, and to issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for other purposes in connection with financing metropolitan redevelopment projects, in whole or in part.
