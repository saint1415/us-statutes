      "text": "A municipality is a body politic and corporate under the name and form of government selected by its qualified electors.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nHome rule municipalities.— Powers set forth in this section and 3-17-1 NMSA 1978 are independent municipal powers within the meaning of the home rule amendment because they are powers delegated to municipalities completely independent from the home rule amendment.New Mexicans for Free Enterprise v. City of Santa Fe, 2006-NMCA-007, 138 N.M. 785, 126 P.3d 1149.\n\nThis section confers a \"police power\" upon municipalitiesto protect their inhabitants and preserve peace and order within the municipal limits. A municipality may adopt ordinances for this purpose under authority of 3-17-1A NMSA 1978.City of Hobbs v. Biswell, 1970-NMCA-086, 81 N.M. 778, 473 P.2d 917, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 772, 473 P.2d 911.\n\nAuthority of city.— The city is the sole judge as to what is best for the public health and safety of its inhabitants.Barber's Super Mkts., Inc., v. City of Grants, 1969-NMSC-115, 80 N.M. 533, 458 P.2d 785;Gomez v. City of Las Vegas, 1956-NMSC-021, 61 N.M. 27, 293 P.2d 984.\n\nStatute prescribing procedure.— The rule is well established that where the statute directs in definite terms the manner in which municipal acts are to be exercised, such statutory method must be substantially followed.City of Clovis v. Crain, 1960-NMSC-129, 68 N.M. 10, 357 P.2d 667.\n\nII. CAPACITY FOR SUIT.\n\nMunicipality is liable for its negligence when engaged in a proprietary functionas distinguished from a governmental function.Murphy v. City of Carlsbad, 1960-NMSC-011, 66 N.M. 376, 348 P.2d 492.\n\nMunicipality acts in a governmental capacity:(a) when it performs a duty imposed by the legislature of the state, (b) only when such imposed duty is one the state may perform and which pertains to the administration of government, (c) when the municipality acts for the public benefit generally, as distinguished from acting for its immediate benefit and its private good, and (d) when the act performed is legislative or discretionary as distinguished from ministerial.Murphy v. City of Carlsbad, 1960-NMSC-011, 66 N.M. 376, 348 P.2d 492;Barker v. City of Santa Fe, 1943-NMSC-012, 47 N.M. 85, 136 P.2d 480.\n\nEstablishment and maintenance of a municipal park is a proprietary functionand a city is not immune to a suit for negligence connected therewith.Murphy v. City of Carlsbad, 1960-NMSC-011, 66 N.M. 376, 348 P.2d 492.\n\nLiability for condition of streets or sidewalks.— The liability of a town or city to damages for injuries which result proximately from the dangerous condition in which, with knowledge actual or constructive, it permits its streets or sidewalks to remain cannot be successfully challenged.Murphy v. City of Carlsbad, 1960-NMSC-011, 66 N.M. 376, 348 P.2d 492 (decided under prior law).\n\nCapacity for suit.— A municipal corporation, having capacity to sue and be sued, may be sued both at law and in equity whenever a cause of action exists against it. The fact that a creditor may not be able to obtain satisfaction of his judgment against a municipal corporation does not affect his right to sue and obtain a judgment.Roswell Drainage Dist. v. Parker, 53 F.2d 793 (10th Cir. 1931).\n\nIII. CONTRACTS.\n\nImplied contract.— Where a municipality enacted an ordinance that adopted a comprehensive personnel policy manual that required the municipality to offer to its retiring employees the option of continuing their health care coverage under the municipality's group plan at the active employee premium reimbursement rate; the petitioners, who retired from municipal service, accepted the municipality's offer at the time they retired and before the municipal council enacted an ordinance deleting the retirement insurance provision from the manual; municipal employees were required to be provided with a copy of and acknowledge receipt of the manual; employees were bound by the terms of the manual; the municipality felt bound to comply with the manual; municipal officials made admissions by their statements and conduct that the municipality was obligated to continue paying health insurance premiums for retirees who had accepted the municipality's offer to do so after the retirees had met the requirements of the ordinance existing at the time of retirement; and municipal officials made admissions that provisions of the manual became terms of an employment contract and the retirees had a vested interest in continued health insurance benefits, there was sufficient evidence to show the existence of genuine issues of material fact regarding whether an implied contract was formed and the scope of its terms.Beggs v. City of Portales, 2009-NMSC-023, 146 N.M. 372, 210 P.3d 798.\n\nRatification of mayoral act.— City council ratified the mayor's termination of a joint powers agreement for the operation of a detention center where the mayor sent a copy of the letter that terminated the agreement to the president of the city council and the city council adopted a resolution in which the city council stated that it supported the termination of the agreement and resolved that the city proceed to transfer the operation and administration of the detention center to the county.Bernalillo BBC v. Chavez, 2008-NMCA-028, 143 N.M. 543, 178 P.3d 828, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-002, 143 N.M. 665, 180 P.3d 674.\n\nContractual or vested rights not implied.— Retired municipal employees did not have a contractual or vested right to the lifetime reimbursement of health insurance premiums where the municipal ordinance that permitted retired employees to elect to continue their insurance coverage under the municipality's group plan after retirement did not contain express language creating contractual rights private and stated that the ordinance could be altered or modified.Beggs v. City of Portales, 2007-NMCA-125, 142 N.M. 505, 167 P.3d 953,rev'd,2009-NMSC-023, 146 N.M. 372, 210 P.3d 798..\n\nMunicipality has authority to enter into collective bargaining agreement with electrical unionrespecting its employees engaged in the operation of its electrical utility, when the municipality is operating an electric utility in its corporate or proprietary capacity.Internal Bhd. of Elec. Workers Local 611 v. Town of Farmington, 1965-NMSC-090, 75 N.M. 393, 405 P.2d 233.\n\nIV. UTILITIES.\n\nRates charged by municipally owned utilities.— Where the municipality owns and operates a water and sewer system, the rates charged by it must be fair, reasonable and just, uniform and nondiscriminatory. The city has the power to set reasonable rates in excess of actual expenditures in furnishing municipally owned utility services, if such rates compare favorably with those received by private utility companies.Apodaca v. Wilson, 1974-NMSC-071, 86 N.M. 516, 525 P.2d 876.\n\nDetermination of reasonableness.— When read in conjunction with the Public Utilities Act (62-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.), Subsection H clearly does not require a municipality to utilize any particular study or methodology to satisfy the standard of reasonableness.Fleming v. Town of Silver City, 1999-NMCA-149, 128 N.M. 295, 992 P.2d 308, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 148, 990 P.2d 822.\n\nV. PREEMPTION.\n\nLocal ordinance preempted by federal law.— An ordinance establishing procedures for telecommunications providers seeking access to city-owned rights-of-way caused substantial increase in costs imposed by excess conduit requirements, appraisal-based rent, cost-based application and registration fees and which gave the city free ranging discretion in determining whether or not to accept a registration or lease application was preempted by 47 U.S.C. 353.Qwest Corp. v. City of Santa Fe, 380 F.3d 1258 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\nLocal ordinance not preempted by state law.— Reading the New Mexico Telecommunications Act, 63-9A-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., and N.M. Const., art. XI, § 2 inpari materiawith New Mexico's Municipal Code, Chapter 3 NMSA 1978, and N.M. Const., art. X, § 6, the provisions of a Santa Fe telecommunications ordinance, regulating the power to contract with a service provider and to enforce provisions related to land use and rights of way held by the city, were not preempted by state law, inasmuch as they did not purport to usurp New Mexico public regulation commission's power to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity to providers of public telecommunications services or to regulate rates and quality of service for intrastate telecommunications services.Qwest Corp. v. City of Santa Fe, 224 F. Supp. 2d 1305 (D.N.M. 2002) affirmed in part, remanded in part, 380 F.3d 1258 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\nContracts for rates with public utilities.— Cities and towns have power to contract with public service companies for rates to their inhabitants for electrical current for power purposes.City of Albuquerque v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Com'n, 1993-NMSC-021, 115 N.M. 521, 854 P.2d 348;Town of Gallup v. Gallup Elec. Light & Power Co., 1924-NMSC-034, 29 N.M. 610, 225 P. 724.\n\nLeases permitted.— A city or county government has the legal power to enter into a lease agreement for property, with or without improvements, which will be used as a fire station. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-30.\n\nMunicipalities or counties may lease equipment or other personal property on a long-term basis. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-20.\n\nA municipality may enter into a long-term lease with the New Mexico boys' school for land and buildings for the purpose of setting up a recreation center for the community and the surrounding area, and which will be under the control and supervision of the municipality. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-33.\n\nPower to make gift not included in section.— Municipal corporations are creatures of statute; they have only the powers with which they are invested by the statutes creating them. Powers of cities and towns are set out in this section. No power to make a gift of any kind is mentioned. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-160.\n\nRegulating construction of state building.— In the absence of a statute specifically authorizing municipalities to regulate construction of buildings of the state, or state institutions, located within the municipalities, such power does not exist in the municipality. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5847.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Rights of New Mexico Municipalities Regarding the Siting and Operation of Privately Owned Landfills\", see 21 N.M. L.

      "text": "Unless otherwise provided by law, no municipality may impose:\n\nA. an income tax;\n\nB. a tax on property measured on an ad valorem, per unit or other basis; or\n\nC. any excise tax including but not limited to:\n\n(1) sales taxes;\n\n(2) gross receipts; and\n\n(3) excise taxes on any incident relating to:\n\n(a) tobacco;\n\n(b) liquor;\n\n(c) motor fuels; and\n\n(d) motor vehicles.\n\nD. However, any municipality may impose excise taxes of the sales, gross receipts or any other type on specific products and services, other than those enumerated in Paragraph (3) of Subsection C of this section, if the products and services taxed are each named specifically in the ordinance imposing the tax on them and if the ordinance is approved by a majority vote in the municipality.\n\nE. Subsections C and D of this section shall not be construed to apply to or otherwise affect any occupation tax imposed prior to or after the effective date of this act under Sections 3-38-1 through 3-38-12 NMSA 1978 [3-38-1 to 3-38-6 NMSA 1978], as those sections may be amended from time to time; provided, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the sale of motor vehicles.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 72-4-1.1, enacted by Laws 1972, ch. 26, § 1; recompiled as 1953 Comp., § 14-17-1.1, by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 154; 1980, ch. 101, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The reference to 3-38-1 to 3-38-12 NMSA 1978 in Subsection E seems incorrect, as 3-38-7 to 3-38-12 were either repealed or recompiled in 1981. Sections 3-38-1 to 3-38-6 NMSA 1978 presently deal with municipal licenses and taxes. The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not a part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For Municipal Local Option Gross Receipts Tax Act,seeChapter 7, Article 19D NMSA 1978.\n\nThis section is an example of specific denial of power,whereby, unless otherwise provided by law, municipalities are prohibited from imposing an income tax or an ad valorem property tax, and then, with some exceptions, are authorized to levy certain excise taxes if the ordinance imposing such a tax is approved by the majority vote in the municipality.Apodaca v. Wilson, 1974-NMSC-071, 86 N.M. 516, 525 P.2d 876.\n\nOccupation tax deemed excise tax.— There is no question but that an occupation tax imposed under 3-38-3 NMSA 1978 is an excise tax as that term is used in this section.City of Alamogordo v. Walker Motor Co., 1980-NMSC-038, 94 N.M. 690, 616 P.2d 403.\n\nNo occupation tax on motor vehicle sales.— Municipal occupation taxes may not be imposed under 3-38-3 NMSA 1978 on any incident relating to motor vehicle sales.City of Alamogordo v. Walker Motor Co., 1980-NMSC-038, 94 N.M. 690, 616 P.2d 403.\n\nA home rule municipality is prohibited from imposing any tax absent specific legislative authorization.— The Municipal Charter Act, 3-15-1 to 3-15-16 NMSA 1978, prohibits a home rule municipality from imposing any tax absent specific legislative authorization, and 3-18-2 NMSA 1978, precludes a municipality, including a home rule municipality, from imposing income and property taxes unless otherwise provided by law and allows excise taxes on certain products and services if the products or services subject to the tax are named specifically in the ordinance imposing the tax and the ordinance is approved by a majority of the voters in the municipality, and therefore a home rule municipality that is considering the imposition of a tax on items such as telecommunications services, styrofoam use, plastic bottle use, carbon emissions, and plastic bag use, may impose such taxes if those products or services are named specifically in the ordinance imposing the tax and the ordinance is approved by a majority of the voters in the home rule municipality.Limits on Taxes Imposed by Home Rule Municipalities(3/20/15), Att'y Gen.

City of Albuquerque, 2011-NMCA-038, 149 N.M. 556, 252 P.3d 780, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.\n\nImposition of red light camera ordinance penalties.— Section 3-18-17 NMSA 1978 does not restrict a municipality's authority to impose penalties only upon the driver of a vehicle observed violating a red light camera ordinance. A municipality may hold registered owners of vehicles strictly and vicariously liable for violations of the ordinance for which the owner is unable or unwilling to nominate the actual driver or to prove a defense or where the owner is unsuccessful in asserting a defense.Titus v. City of Albuquerque, 2011-NMCA-038, 149 N.M. 556, 252 P.3d 780, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.\n\nMotor Vehicle Code does not preempt the authority to enact a red light camera ordinance.— Where a municipal red light camera ordinance did not impose an affirmative disability or restraint on violators; the civil penalties for violations were purely monetary and were not criminally punitive; scienter was not necessary to a find a violation; the ordinance was a nuisance abatement ordinance; the civil penalties were rationally connected with abating a nuisance; the imposition of the civil penalties was not excessive in relation to the purpose of the ordinance to abate a nuisance; and the civil penalties imposed for violations of the ordinance were not sufficiently punitive to outweigh the civil remedial effect of the ordinance, the ordinance is not a criminal statute that is preempted by the Motor Vehicle Code.Titus v. City of Albuquerque, 2011-NMCA-038, 149 N.M. 556, 252 P.3d 780, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.\n\nRed light camera ordinance did not deny procedural due process.— Where the owner of a motor vehicle received notice of two speeding violations and fines pursuant to a municipality's red light camera ordinance; the violations were observed by video detection equipment; at an administrative hearing, the owner did not contest the fact that the video equipment had observed vehicles registered in the owner's name speeding on the dates in question; the owner claimed that the owner was not the driver of the vehicle and presented evidence that the owner was not in the municipality on the dates of the violations; the owner did not nominate the actual driver of the vehicle on the dates of the violations as permitted by the ordinance or claim any of the defense provided for in the ordinance; and the ordinance provided that the registered owner of a vehicle observed violating the ordinance was strictly and vicariously liable for the violation, the imposition of penalties on the owner for violation of the ordinance was legal and constitutional.Titus v. City of Albuquerque, 2011-NMCA-038, 149 N.M. 556, 252 P.3d 780, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.\n\nMunicipality had authority to enact a red light camera ordinance.— Where a municipality's determination that red light violations and speeding are public nuisances was premised on findings that there was a significant risk to health and safety of the community from drivers who run red lights and exceed posted speed limits; that red light violations are a matter of unique local concern to the municipality, because of high traffic volume and crowded intersections; that the municipality had one of the highest fatality and serious injury rates in the nation from red light violations and disregard by drivers for existing state red light laws; that red light violations are connected to death and serious injury to a degree not evident with regard to other traffic violations; that drivers in the municipality repeatedly violate posted speed limits; that state law against speeding was inadequate to preserve public safety in the municipality; and that nationally, red light cameras had decreased red light violations, the municipality's findings proved that speeding and red light violations are nuisances per se and the municipality acted within the scope of its authority under 3-18-17 NMSA 1978 in enacting the red light camera ordinance and designating speeding and red light violations nuisances.Titus v. City of Albuquerque, 2011-NMCA-038, 149 N.M. 556, 252 P.3d 780, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.\n\nResidential picketing.— An ordinance declaring residential picketing a nuisance even though such acts violate only private rights and produce damages to but one or a few persons constitutes a valid exercise of governmental power.Garcia v. Gray, 507 F. 2d 539 (10th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 971, 95 S. Ct. 1967, 44 L.Ed. 2d 462 (1975).\n\nLoitering on school grounds.— To interpret a city ordinance prohibiting loitering on school grounds without lawful business there as saying that no one had the right to be on school property without permission would raise serious constitutional questions, where the ordinance did not state that permission to be on school grounds was required.Anderson v. Shaver, 290 F. Supp. 920 (D.N.M. 1968).\n\nSolicitors.— The frequent ringing of doorbells of private residences by itinerant vendors and solicitors may be in fact a nuisance to the occupants of homes, or may be so considered by the municipality in one locality.Green v. Town of Gallup, 1941-NMSC-050, 46 N.M. 71, 120 P.2d 619.\n\nSunday dances.— The intention of the legislature is clear in that cities and towns have the authority to license, regulate and prohibit the giving or holding of dances on Sunday. 1954 Op.
