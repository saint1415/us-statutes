      "heading": "Refunding bonds.",
      "text": "A. Any bonds issued by any municipality and payable from any revenues of any airport facility may be refunded in the name of the municipality issuing the bonds being refunded, by the issuance of bonds to refund, pay and discharge all or any part of the outstanding bonds, including any interest on the bonds in arrears or about to become due within three years from the date of the refunding bonds and for the purpose of avoiding or terminating any default in the payment of interest on and principal of the bonds, of reducing interest costs or effecting other economies, or of modifying or eliminating restrictive contractual limitations appertaining to the issuance of additional bonds or to any facilities or income appertaining thereto, or for any combination of the foregoing purposes. Refunding bonds shall be authorized by ordinance, shall be payable from a pledge of the net income derived from any or all designated airport facilities, whether or not financed from any bond proceeds, and additionally may be payable from a pledge of any or all of the additional sources permitted by Sections 3-39-6 and 3-39-12 NMSA 1978 and may be issued under the same terms and conditions allowable by the Municipal Airport Law for airport facilities bonds. Any bonds which are refunded under the provisions of this section shall be paid at maturity or on any permitted prior redemption date in the amounts, at the time and places and, if called prior to maturity, in accordance with any applicable notice provisions, all as provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of said refunded bonds or otherwise appertaining thereto, except for any such bond which is voluntarily surrendered for exchange or payment by the holder. Refunding bonds may be delivered in exchange for the outstanding bonds refunded or may be sold at either public or private sale.\n\nB. No bonds may be refunded under the Municipal Airport Law unless the bonds either mature or are callable for prior redemption under their terms within fifteen years from the date of issuance of the refunding bonds, or unless the holders thereof voluntarily surrender them for exchange or payment. Provision shall be made for paying the bonds refunded within said period of time. Interest on any bond may be increased. The principal amount of the refunding bonds may exceed the principal amount of the refunded bonds, but only to the extent that any costs incidental to the refunding bonds or any interest on the bonds refunded in arrears or about to become due within three years from the date of the refunding bonds, or both said incidental costs and interest, are capitalized with the proceeds of refunding bonds. The principal amount of the refunding bonds may also exceed the principal amount of the refunded bonds if the aggregate principal and interest costs of the refunding bonds do not exceed such unaccrued costs of the bonds refunded. The principal amount of the refunding bonds may also be less than or the same as the principal amount of the bonds being refunded so long as provision is duly and sufficiently made for the payment of the refunded bonds.\n\nC. The proceeds of refunding bonds shall either be immediately applied to the retirement of the bonds being refunded or be placed in escrow in a commercial bank or trust company, either a state or national banking institution, which possesses and is exercising trust powers, which is located within New Mexico and which is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to be applied to the payment of the bonds being refunded upon their presentation therefor. To the extent any incidental expenses have been capitalized, such refunding bond proceeds may be used to defray such expenses, and any accrued interest and any premium appertaining to a sale of refunding bonds may be applied to the payment of the interest thereon and the principal thereof, or both interest and principal, or may be deposited in a reserve therefor, as the municipality may determine. Nothing in this section requires the establishment of an escrow if the refunded bonds become due and payable within one year from the date of the refunding bonds and if the amounts necessary to retire the refunded bonds within that time are deposited with the paying agent for said refunded bonds. Any such escrow shall not necessarily be limited to proceeds of refunding bonds but may include other moneys available for its purpose. Any proceeds in escrow, pending such use, may be invested or reinvested in bills, certificates of indebtedness, notes or bonds which are directed obligations of, or the principal and interest of which obligations are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States of America. Such proceeds and investments in escrow, together with any interest to be derived from any such investment, shall be in an amount at all times sufficient as to principal, interest, any prior redemption premium due and any charges of the escrow agent payable therefrom, to pay the bonds being refunded as they become due at their respective maturities or due at any designated prior redemption date or dates in connection with which the municipality shall exercise a prior redemption option. Any purchaser of any refunding bond issued under the Municipal Airport Law, is in no manner responsible for the application of the proceeds thereof by the municipality or any of its officers, agents or employees.\n\nD. Refunding bonds may bear such additional terms and provisions as may be determined by the municipality subject to the limitations in the Municipal Airport Law for original bond issues and are not subject to the provisions of any other statute except as may be incorporated by reference in the Municipal Airport Law.\n\nE. Municipalities may pledge irrevocably for the payment of interest and principal of refunding bonds, any of such net income of airport facilities, and any such additional special funds and additional security which may be pledged to an original issue of bonds authorized pursuant to the Municipal Airport Law, even if any of such additional special fund and additional security was not pledged to the bonds being refunded.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-40-6.1, enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 206, § 2; 1973, ch. 196, § 1.",

In the event that a political subdivision has adopted, or hereafter adopts, a general zoning ordinance regulating, among other things, the height of buildings, any airport zoning regulations adopted for the same area or portion thereof under the Municipal Airport Zoning Law [3-39-16 to 3-39-26 NMSA 1978] may be incorporated and made a part of such general zoning regulations, and be administered and enforced in connection therewith, but such general zoning regulations shall not limit the effectiveness or scope of the regulations adopted under this act.\n\nC. Any zoning or other regulations applicable to any area within which, according to an airport approach plan adopted by the legislative body, measures should be taken for the protection of airport approaches, including not only any airport zoning regulations adopted under Sections 3-39-16 through 3-39-26 NMSA 1978, but any zoning or other regulations dealing with the same or similar matters, that have been or may be adopted under authority other than that conferred by Sections 3-39-16 through 3-39-26 NMSA 1978, shall be consistent with, and conform to, the legislative body's approach plan for such area, and shall be amended from time to time as may be necessary to conform to any revision of the plan that may be made by the legislative body.\n\nD.

When advisable to facilitate the enforcement of the Municipal Airport Zoning Law [3-39-16 to 3-39-26 NMSA 1978], a system may be established for granting permits to establish or construct new structures and other uses. In any event, before any nonconforming structure may be replaced with a taller one or any nonconforming tree allowed to grow higher or be replanted, a permit must be secured from the administrative agency authorized to administer and enforce the regulations, authorizing such replacement or change. No such permit shall be granted that would allow the structure to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable regulation was adopted; and whenever the administrative agency determines that nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than eighty percent torn down, destroyed, deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow said structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. Except as indicated, all applications for permits for replacement, change or repair of nonconforming uses shall be granted.\n\nB. Any person desiring to erect any structure, or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or otherwise use his property, in violation of airport zoning regulations adopted under the Municipal Airport Zoning Law, may apply to the board of appeals, as provided in Section 3-39-22 NMSA 1978, for a variance from the zoning regulations in question. Such variance shall be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of the regulations.\n\nC. In granting any permit or variance under this section, the administrative agency or board of appeals may, if it deems such action advisable to effectuate the purposes of the Municipal Airport Zoning Law, and reasonable in the circumstances, so condition such permit or variance as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the political subdivision, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain suitable obstruction markers and obstruction lights thereon.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-40-19, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300.",

No airport zoning regulations shall be adopted, amended or changed under the Municipal Airport Zoning Law [3-39-16 to 3-39-26 NMSA 1978] except by action of the legislative body of the political subdivision in question, after a public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. At least fifteen days' notice of the hearing shall be published in an official paper, or a paper of general circulation, in the political subdivision.\n\nB. The legislative body of any political subdivision adopting airport zoning regulations under the Municipal Airport Zoning Law may delegate the duty of administering and enforcing such regulations to any administrative agency under its jurisdiction, but such administrative agency shall not be or include any member of the board of appeals. The duties of such administrative agency shall include that of hearing and deciding all permits under Section 3-39-21 NMSA 1978, but such agency shall not have or exercise any of the powers delegated to the board of appeals.\n\nC. Airport zoning regulations adopted under the Municipal Airport Zoning Law shall provide for appointment of a board of appeals to have and exercise the following powers:\n\n(1) to hear and decide appeals from any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the administrative agency in the enforcement of Sections 3-39-16 through 3-39-26 NMSA 1978, or of any ordinance adopted pursuant thereto;\n\n(2) to hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance upon which such board may be required to pass under such ordinance; and\n\n(3) to hear and decide specific variances under Section 3-39-21 NMSA 1978.\n\nD. Where a zoning board of appeals or adjustment already exists, it may be appointed as the board of appeals. Otherwise, the board of appeals shall consist of five members, each to be appointed for a term of three years and to be removable for cause by the appointing authority upon written charges and after public hearing.\n\nE. The board shall adopt rules in accordance with the provisions of any ordinance adopted under Sections 3-39-16 through 3-39-26 NMSA 1978. Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board may determine. The chairman, or in his absence the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the board shall be public. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall immediately be filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record.\n\nF. Appeals to the board may be taken by any person aggrieved, or by any other officer, department, board or bureau of the political subdivision affected, by any decision of the administrative agency. An appeal must be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the agency from which the appeal is taken and with the board, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The agency from which the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.\n\nG. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the agency from which the appeal is taken certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in its opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or by a court of record on application on notice to the agency from which the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.\n\nH. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice and due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.\n\nI. The board may, in conformity with the provisions of the Municipal Airport Zoning Law, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify, the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative agency from which the appeal is taken.\n\nJ. The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the board shall be sufficient to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the administrative agency, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such ordinance, or to effect any variation in such ordinance.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-40-20, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"County Regulation of Land Use and Development,\" see 9 Nat.
