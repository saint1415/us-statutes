The city manager's authority over \"persons engaged in the administrative service of the municipality\" does not include authority over other appointed municipal officers. The legislature has provided the governing body of a municipality with authority to appoint officers and to prescribe their powers and duties; appointed officers, therefore, serve at the pleasure of the governing body and are not subject to the authority of the city manager, who is also an appointed officer.Authority of City Manager in a Mayor-Council Municipality(6/23/22), Att'y Gen.

Const., art. VI, § 32, created a judicial standards commission and explicitly provided for grounds for and general procedures to be followed in removing judges from office, no legislatively created means of removing judicial officers was contemplated. Therefore, this section, which provided for recall of elective officers in commission-manager municipalities, was contrary to that section insofar as it pertained to removal of municipal judges.Cooper v.
