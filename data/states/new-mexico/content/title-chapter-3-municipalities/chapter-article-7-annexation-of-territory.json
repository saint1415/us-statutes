      "heading": "Methods of annexation.Section 3-7-1",
      "text": "A. There shall be three methods of annexing territory to a municipality:\n\n(1) the arbitration method as provided in Sections 3-7-5 through 3-7-10 NMSA 1978;\n\n(2) the boundary commission method as provided in Sections 3-7-11 through 3-7-16 NMSA 1978; and\n\n(3) the petition method as provided in Section 3-7-17 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. Territory may be annexed to a municipality by any one of the three methods of annexation provided for in Sections 3-7-5 through 3-7-18 NMSA 1978 except where limitations of annexation are provided by law. The provisions of this section apply to annexations of all municipalities except those that are otherwise specifically provided by law. The arbitration method of annexation may be used for municipal annexation of a traditional historic community only upon petition of a majority of the qualified electors of the territory within the traditional historic community.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-7-1, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300; 1979, ch. 159, § 1; 1995, ch. 170, § 2; 1995, ch. 211, § 1; 2019, ch. 212, § 180.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective April 3, 2019, in Subsection B, removed \"registered\" preceding \"qualified electors\".\n\n1995 amendments.— Virtually identical amendments were enacted by Laws 1995, ch. 170, § 2, effective April 5, 1995, inserting \"except where limitations of annexation are provided by law\" in the first sentence of Subsection B, and adding the sentence of Subsection B beginning \"The arbitration method of annexation\", approved April 5, 1995, and by Laws 1995, ch. 211, § 1, effective April 6, 1995, also amending this section in Subsection B by adding the exception at the end of the first sentence and adding the last sentence of the subsection, but also making a minor stylistic change, approved April 6, 1995. The section is set out as amended by Laws 1995, ch. 211, § 1. See 12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nNature of annexation statutes.— The power to create and to destroy municipal corporations, and to enlarge or diminish their boundaries, is solely and exclusively the exercise of legislative power. Such statutes are to be liberally construed in favor of the municipality and every reasonable presumption is given to the validity of the municipality's action.Leavell v. Town of Texico, 1957-NMSC-081, 63 N.M. 233, 316 P.2d 247.\n\nAnnexation methods.— The boundary commission and the arbitration methods are administrative proceedings and the petition method is a legislative proceeding.Drugger v. City of Santa Fe, 1992-NMCA-022, 114 N.M. 47, 834 P.2d 424, cert. quashed, 113 N.M. 744, 832 P.2d 1223.\n\nAnnexation of Indian Pueblo.— To allow the exercise of jurisdiction by a municipality to annex a portion of the Indian Pueblo and make it subject to jurisdiction of the municipality would affect the authority of the tribal council over reservation affairs and, hence, would infringe on the right of the Indians to govern themselves and would therefore be void.Your Food Stores, Inc. v. Village of Espanola, 1961-NMSC-041, 68 N.M. 327, 361 P.2d 950, cert. denied, 368 U.S. 915, 82 S. Ct. 194, 7 L. Ed. 2d 131.\n\nAnnexation of class A county land excepted.— A specific exception to this section is defined by the Metropolitan Boundary Act for Class A Counties (3-57-1 to 3-57-9 NMSA 1978), which provides for the annexation of territory to a municipality within a class A county. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-28.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Annexation of Unincorporated Territory in New Mexico,\" see 6 Nat.

To qualify as a traditional historic community, an area shall:\n\n(1) be an unincorporated area of a county;\n\n(2) be an identifiable village, community, neighborhood or district that can be documented as having existed for more than one hundred years;\n\n(3) include structures or landmarks that are associated with the identity of the specific village, community, neighborhood or district seeking designation as a traditional historic community;\n\n(4) have a distinctive character or traditional quality that can be distinguished from surrounding areas or new developments in the vicinity; and\n\n(5) be declared a traditional historic community by an ordinance of the board of county commissioners of the county in which the petitioning village, community, neighborhood or district is located.\n\nB. A traditional historic community may be annexed by a municipality only by petition of a majority of the qualified electors of the territory within the traditional historic community proposed to be annexed by the municipality or by the arbitration method of annexation only upon petition of a majority of the qualified electors of the territory within the traditional historic community.\n\nHistory:Laws 1995, ch. 170, § 5; 1995, ch. 211, § 4; 2019, ch. 6, § 2; 2019, ch. 212, § 181.\n\n2019 Multiple Amendments.—Laws 2019, ch. 6, § 2, effective July 1, 2019, and Laws 2019, ch. 212, § 181, effective April 3, 2019, enacted different amendments to this section that can be reconciled. Pursuant to 12-1-8 NMSA 1978, Laws 2019, ch. 212, § 181 as the last act signed by the governor, is set out above and incorporates both amendments. The amendments enacted by Laws 2019, ch. 6, § 2 and Laws 2019, ch. 212, § 181 are described below. To view the session laws in their entirety,seethe 2019 session laws onNMOneSource.com.\n\nThe nature of the difference between the amendments is that Laws 2019, ch. 6, § 2, revised the qualifications for an area to be considered a traditional historic community, and Laws 2019, ch. 212, § 181, removed \"registered\" preceding \"qualified electors\".\n\nLaws 2019, ch. 6, § 2,effective July 1, 2019, revised the qualifications for an area to be considered a traditional historic community; in Subsection A, in Paragraph A(1), after \"unincorporated area of a\", deleted \"class B\", and after the next occurrence of \"county\", deleted \"with a population between ninety-five thousand and ninety-nine thousand five hundred, based on the 1990 federal decennial census\"; in Subsection B, after \"majority of the registered\", deleted \"qualified electors\" and added \"voters\".\n\nLaws 2019, ch. 212, § 181,effective April 3, 2019, in Subsection B, removed \"registered\" preceding each occurrence of \"qualified electors\".\n\nA traditional historic community may not be annexed by a municipality unless annexation is considered by a petition of a majority of the qualified electors within the traditional historic community.— The annexation of a traditional historic community is allowable only by petition of a majority of the qualified electors of the territory within the traditional historic community proposed to be annexed by the municipality or by the arbitration method of annexation upon petition of a majority of the qualified electors of the territory, and therefore the town of Taos is barred from annexing any land within the Las Comunidades Del Valle de Los Ranchos, which was declared a traditionally historic community by county ordinance by the Taos county commission in 2022, in the absence of a petition meeting the requirements of 3-7-1.1 NMSA 1978. 2024 Op.

Therefore, the commission's decision-making process was entitled to priority as against annexation ordinances adopted by municipalities after an annexation petition had already been filed with the commission.AMREP Southwest, Inc. v.
