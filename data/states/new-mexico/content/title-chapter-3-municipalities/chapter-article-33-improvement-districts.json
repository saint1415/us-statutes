Upon the adoption of the provisional order by the governing body, the estimated maximum benefit roll showing the legal description of the property to be included in the district and the owners thereof may be recorded with the clerk of the county in which the property is located, which recording shall constitute notice of the pendency of the special assessment district and shall be constructive notice to the owner, purchaser or encumbrancer of the property concerned; and any person whose conveyance is subsequently recorded shall be considered a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer and shall be subject to and bound by all the proceedings taken after the recording of the notice to the same extent as if he were made a party to such special assessment proceedings.\n\nG. This notice need not be acknowledged to entitle it to be recorded.\n\nH. Nothing herein shall be construed to affect the priority of special assessment liens.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-32-4, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300; 1991, ch. 199, § 8.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective April 4, 1991, added \"preliminary lien; notice of pendency of district; effect\" to the section heading; in Subsection B, added the language beginning \"and, if the benefit\" at the end of Subparagraph (b) in Paragraph (2) and inserted \"road\" in Subparagraph (a) in Paragraph (3); inserted \"tax reimbursement, capital improvement, expansion, construction period interest, reserve fund, financing\" in Subsection C; added Paragraph (3) in Subsection E and Subsections F to H; and made related and other stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nStatutory grant of power to municipalities to improve streets vestsonly when the proper method to implement that power is adopted.Bowdich v. City of Albuquerque, 1966-NMSC-133, 76 N.M. 511, 416 P.2d 523.\n\nSection outlines steps.— The steps which a municipality shall take, when the governing body of the city feels that the interest of their municipality requires that any streets, alleys or any part thereof be graded, graveled, paved, macadamized, sidewalked, lighted or in any manner improved are outlined in part in this section.Bowdich v. City of Albuquerque, 1966-NMSC-133, 76 N.M. 511, 416 P.2d 523.\n\nConclusiveness in establishing district.— A city council in establishing a municipal improvement district is acting in its legislative capacity, and its action, in the absence of proof of fraud or such arbitrary conduct as amounts to fraud, is conclusive.Feldhake v. City of Santa Fe, 1956-NMSC-079, 61 N.M. 348, 300 P.2d 934.\n\nBurden of proof in attacking establishment of district.— The burden of proof as to fraud or arbitrary conduct equivalent to fraud necessarily rests upon him who makes an attack upon the action of the city in determining that a municipal improvement district shall be established.Feldhake v. City of Santa Fe, 1956-NMSC-079, 61 N.M. 348, 300 P.2d 934.\n\nConstitutionality of provisional order paving law.— \"Provisional order\" paving law does not violate the state and federal constitutions.Hodges v. City of Roswell, 1926-NMSC-016, 31 N.M. 384, 247 P. 310;Ellis v. New Mexico Constr. Co., 1921-NMSC-068, 27 N.M. 312, 201 P. 487.\n\nLegislature intended when it adopted provisional order method of street improvementthat repaving be a continuation of the paving power and the benefited owners be liable for the cost.Bowdich v. City of Albuquerque, 1966-NMSC-133, 76 N.M. 511, 416 P.2d 523.\n\nConstitutionality of front-foot rule.— Laws authorizing the assessment of benefits by the front-foot rule are not in violation of either the federal or state constitutions as taking property without due process, in the absence of a showing that the assessment is arbitrary, capricious or confiscatory.Fowler v. City of Santa Fe, 1963-NMSC-045, 72 N.M. 60, 380 P.2d 511.\n\nMore than a mere division of costs on a front-foot basis among the lots affected is requiredto determine estimated benefits.Teutsch v. City of Santa Fe, 1966-NMSC-018, 75 N.M. 717, 410 P.2d 742.\n\nPresumption that estimated benefit was basis for assessment.— It may fairly be presumed that officials charged with the duty of improvement district assessments made them on the basis of estimated benefit to the property assessed.Hedges v. City Comm'n, 1957-NMSC-042, 62 N.M. 421, 311 P.2d 649.\n\nReasonable future uses considered as benefit to assessed property.— Benefits to assessed property in an improvement district can be determined by considering reasonable future uses to which the property can be put.Clayton v. City of Farmington, 1985-NMCA-005, 102 N.M. 340, 695 P.2d 490.\n\nFees included in assessment.— Engineers' and attorneys' fees are properly chargeable as a part of the costs of a paving improvement, and, as such, are properly included in a local assessment against owners.Massengill v. City of Clovis, 1928-NMSC-047, 33 N.M. 519, 270 P. 886.\n\nPaving includes curbing and guttering.— When it is declared that a street should be paved, the word \"paved\" includes not only the paving but also curbing and guttering as a necessary part of the project.Feldhake v. City of Santa Fe, 1956-NMSC-079, 61 N.M. 348, 300 P.2d 934.\n\nRecitation of alternative kinds of paving satisfied statute.— Determination that streets were to be paved with a permanent pavement, reciting in the alternative several kinds of permanent paving, was sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements.Hodges v. City of Roswell, 1926-NMSC-016, 31 N.M. 384, 247 P. 310.\n\nScope of judicial review regarding special assessments.— Because the basis and method of apportioning special assessments is committed to the judgment and sound discretion of the legislative tribunal having charge of such improvement, the decision of such tribunal will not be disturbed by the courts in the absence of a clear showing that such decision was wholly arbitrary, capricious or actuated by fraud or bad faith.Hedges v. City Comm'n, 1957-NMSC-042, 62 N.M. 421, 311 P.2d 649.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 70A Am. Jur. 2d Special or Local Assessment § 134 et seq.",

If in connection with the creation of the improvement district the governing body determines that it is in the best interest of the municipality to finance the district improvements by the imposition of an improvement district property tax and the issuance of improvement district general obligation bonds, the governing body shall enact an ordinance making the determination and provide in the ordinance the improvement district property tax rate to be imposed; the date, which may be a predetermined date or a date to be established in the future after completion of the improvements, of commencement of the tax; the amount of the bonds to be issued to finance the improvements; and any other matters the governing body deems necessary or appropriate. The governing body shall call an election within the improvement district for the purpose of authorizing the governing body to issue general obligation bonds, the proceeds of the sale of which shall be used for constructing the improvements for which the district was created and to impose improvement district property taxes on all taxable property within the district for the purpose of paying the principal, debt service and other expenses incidental to the issuance and sale of the bonds. The election shall be conducted as prescribed by the Local Election Act [Chapter 1, Article 22 NMSA 1978] and pursuant to the requirements of the property tax division of the taxation and revenue department.\n\nB. If at the election described in Subsection A of this section the property tax imposition and the issuance of improvement district general obligation bonds are approved by a majority of the voters voting on the issues, the governing body shall impose the tax at a rate sufficient to pay the debt service on the bonds and retire them at maturity.\n\nC. Imposition and collection of the improvement district property tax authorized in this section shall be made at the same time and in the same manner as impositions and collections of property taxes for use by municipalities and counties are made.\n\nD. Bonds issued by the governing body for payment of the specified improvement district improvements shall be sold at a price that does not result in a net effective interest rate exceeding the maximum net effective interest rate permitted by the Public Securities Act [6-14-1 to 6-14-3 NMSA 1978]. The bonds may be sold at public or private sale and may be in denominations that the governing body determines.\n\nE. The form and terms of the bonds, including a final maturity of thirty years and provisions for their payment and redemption, shall be as determined by the governing body. The bonds shall be executed in the name of and on behalf of the improvement district by the mayor and clerk of the municipality. The bonds may be executed and sealed in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Facsimile Signature of Public Officials Act [6-9-1 to 6-9-6 NMSA 1978].\n\nF. To provide for the payment of the interest and principal of the bonds issued and sold pursuant to this section, the governing body shall annually impose a property tax on all taxable property in the district in an amount sufficient to produce a sum equal to the principal and interest on all bonds as they mature.\n\nG. The bonds authorized in this section are general obligation bonds of the district, and the full faith and credit of the district are pledged to the payment of the bonds. The proceeds obtained from the issuance of the bonds shall not be diverted or expended for any purposes other than those provided in Chapter 3, Article 33 NMSA 1978.\n\nH. All bonds issued by an improvement district shall be fully negotiable and constitute negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all the purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code.

The governing body may in any proceeding authorizing improvement district bonds provide for the initial issuance of one or more bonds aggregating the amount of the entire issue or may make provision for installment payments of the principal amount of any bond as it may consider desirable.\n\nJ. The governing body may issue bonds to be denominated refunding bonds, for the purpose of refunding any of the general obligation bonded indebtedness of the improvement district. Whenever the governing body deems it expedient to issue refunding bonds, it shall adopt an ordinance setting out the facts making the issuance of the refunding bonds necessary or advisable, the determination of the necessity or advisability by the governing body and the amount of refunding bonds that the governing body deems necessary and advisable to issue. The ordinance shall fix the form of the bonds; the rate or rates of interest of the bonds, but the net effective interest rate of the bonds shall not exceed the maximum net effective interest rate permitted by the Public Securities Act; the date of the refunding bonds; the denominations of the refunding bonds; the maturity dates; and the place or places of payment within or without the state of both principal and interest. Refunding bonds when issued, except for bonds issued in book entry or similar form without the delivery of physical securities, shall be negotiable in form and shall bear the signature or the facsimile signature of the mayor and clerk of the municipality. All refunding bonds may be exchanged dollar for dollar for the bonds to be refunded or they may be sold as directed by the governing body, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied only to the purpose for which the bonds were issued and the payment of any incidental expenses.\n\nK. The principal amount of improvement district general obligation bonds that may be issued by the governing body for any improvement district shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the final estimated value of properties in the district after completion of the projects to be financed with the improvement district general obligation bonds and after development of the properties in the improvement district in accordance with their planned use, as determined by the governing body with the assistance of the engineer and other qualified professionals.\n\nL.

The fact that an improvement is omitted for any benefited tract or parcel of land does not invalidate a lien or assessment made against any other tract or parcel of land.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-32-16, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300; 1979, ch. 108, § 1; 1981, ch. 44, § 3; 1991, ch. 199, § 14.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For municipal liens,see3-36-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor property tax lien,see7-38-48 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor proof of publication,see14-11-4 to 14-11-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor statute of limitations,see37-1-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective April 4, 1991, deleted \"foreclosure\" following \"liens\" in the catchline; inserted \"or posting\" following \"publication\" in two places; in Subsection A, inserted \"or provide for setting, by resolution, of the rate or rates of interest upon deferred payments after sale of bonds or assignable certificates as provided in Section 3-33-24 NMSA 1978\" and substituted \"levying\" for \"ratifying\" near the beginning of Subsection A(2) and added Subsections A(4) and A(5); in Subsection B, substituted \"levying an assessment\" for \"ratifying an assessment levied\" in the first sentence and added \"unless the assessment lien is adjusted pursuant to this section\" at the end of the final sentence; inserted \"and levying the assessments\" in Subsection C; deleted former Subsection E, pertaining to foreclosure; substituted \"for any benefited tract\" for \"in front of any tract\" in Subsection F; designated former Subsection F as Subsection E; and made minor stylistic changes throughout this section.\n\nTheory upon which municipal special assessments may be leviedis that the property charged receives a corresponding physical, material and substantial benefit from the improvement, and the property assessed will be enhanced in value to the extent of the burden imposed.Waltom v. City of Portales, 1938-NMSC-022, 42 N.M. 433, 81 P.2d 58.\n\nPower of municipality extendsto making provision for payment of such assessments and deferred payment interest rates.Munro v. City of Albuquerque, 1943-NMSC-050, 48 N.M. 306, 150 P.2d 733.\n\nNature of assessments.— Municipal special assessments are quasi-taxes laid to enable the discharge of some of the functions of government, and the power to impose them is related to the taxing power.Waltom v. City of Portales, 1938-NMSC-022, 42 N.M. 433, 81 P.2d 58.\n\nLiability for payment was in rem.— A legislative intent that the only liability for payment of bonds was in rem and not in personam was indicated.Munro v. City of Albuquerque, 1943-NMSC-050, 48 N.M. 306, 150 P.2d 733.\n\nPriority of liens.— The legislature may provide that the lien of taxes obtained by special assessments shall be paramount to all prior liens created by contract, although statute was enacted subsequent to the lien by contract.City of Albuquerque v. City Elec. Co., 1927-NMSC-036, 32 N.M. 401, 258 P. 574.\n\nPriority of existing liens.— Prior existing assessment liens which have been duly filed or recorded are superior to future liens for local improvement assessments.City of Albuquerque v. Middle Rio Grande Conservancy Dist., 1941-NMSC-021, 45 N.M. 313, 115 P.2d 66.\n\nSecurity interest.— A security interest in property held by the small business administration was not subordinate to a special assessment which was not a tax due on the property, and which, under New Mexico law was on the same plane as a lien for general taxes.United States v. City of Albuquerque, 465 F.2d 776 (10th Cir. 1972).\n\nStatutes elevating special assessment liens to parity with liens for general taxesdid not violate constitutional provision against enactment of special or local laws, nor the constitutional provision against the release, exchange or diminution of any obligation or liability owed by any person or corporation to the state or a municipal corporation, except by payment or by a proper judicial proceeding.Waltom v. City of Portales, 1938-NMSC-022, 42 N.M. 433, 81 P.2d 58.\n\nFour-year statute of limitations appliesand runs against special assessments for street paving obligations, since such assessments are not levied for governmental purposes and are not \"taxes.\"Altman v. Kilburn, 1941-NMSC-023, 45 N.M. 453, 116 P.2d 812.\n\nVoluntary payment of part of assessment,payable in installments, was not of itself sufficient to estop one from defense of confiscation in suit to foreclose lien for unpaid installment.City of Clovis v. Scheurich, 1929-NMSC-022, 34 N.M. 227, 279 P. 876.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 70A Am.

      "text": "A. To pay all or any part of the cost of the improvement, including those items set out in Subsection C of Section 3-33-11 NMSA 1978, the governing body may proceed pursuant to the provisions of Section 3-33-14.1 NMSA 1978 or may issue in the name of the municipality bonds in such form as the governing body may determine or assignable certificates in an amount not exceeding the total cost of the improvement and maturing not more than twenty years from the date of issuance. If the bonds or assignable certificates recite that:\n\n(1) the proceedings relating to making the improvement and levying the assessments as provided in Section 3-33-22 NMSA 1978 or placing the preliminary lien as provided in Section 3-33-11 NMSA 1978 to pay for the improvement have been done in compliance with law; and\n\n(2) all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien or placing the preliminary lien against the tract or parcel of land benefited by the improvement have been performed, such recital shall be conclusive evidence of the facts recited.\n\nB. The assignable certificates shall:\n\n(1) declare the liability of the owner of the tract or parcel of land so assessed or the liability of the tract or parcel of land so assessed for payment of the assessment, interest and penalties;\n\n(2) fix the terms and conditions of the certificates; and\n\n(3) accurately describe the tract or parcel of land covered by the certificate.\n\nC. The bonds shall:\n\n(1) recite the terms and conditions for their issuance;\n\n(2) be payable from money collected from the preliminary assessment lien authorized in Section 3-33-11 NMSA 1978 and, if so payable, also payable from the proceeds of bonds payable from the final assessment lien authorized in Section 3-33-22 NMSA 1978; or\n\n(3) be payable from the money collected from the assessments authorized in Section 3-33-22 NMSA 1978; provided that if assessments are made payable over more than one period of time as permitted by Section 3-33-23 NMSA 1978, specified portions of the bonds may be payable from money collected from those assessments payable over that period of time that generally corresponds to the period of time over which such specified portions of the bonds are payable; and\n\n(4) bear a rate or rates of interest that shall not exceed the rate of interest on the deferred installments of the assessments or, if more than one rate of interest is specified for assessments as permitted by Section 3-33-23 NMSA 1978, on that portion of the deferred installments of assessments from which that specified portion of the bonds may be payable. Payment of the bonds issued for the construction of a project described in Subsection A of Section 3-33-3 NMSA 1978 may be supplemented from gasoline tax money in the street improvement fund authorized by Section 3-34-1 NMSA 1978 on or before a date not more than twelve months after the last deferred installment of an assessment is due from the owner of a tract or parcel of land so assessed.\n\nD. The bonds may be issued to the contractor in payment for the construction of the improvement or may be issued and sold:\n\n(1) in payment of the municipality's proportion of the cost of the improvement;\n\n(2) in payment of the proportionate cost if the improvement is done in cooperation with another governmental agency;\n\n(3) in payment of the construction of the improvement done under contract; or\n\n(4) in reimbursement to the municipality if the municipality constructed the improvement with municipally owned or leased equipment and municipal employees.\n\nE. Any municipality creating a street improvement fund as authorized by Section 3-34-1 NMSA 1978 may contract for the issuance and sale of bonds or assignable certificates.\n\nF. Bonds or assignable certificates may be sold at public or private sale at a discount.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-32-17, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300; 1970, ch. 51, § 1; 1979, ch. 108, § 2; 1983, ch. 265, § 8; 1991, ch. 199, § 15; 2001, ch. 312, § 8.\n\nCross references.— For refunding improvement bonds,see3-33-39 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor destruction of documentary evidence of extinguished public debt,see6-10-62 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, inserted the reference to 3-33-14.1 NMSA 1978, in Subsection A.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective April 4, 1991, in Subsection A, inserted \"including those items set out in Subsection C of Section 3-33-11 NMSA 1978\" near the beginning and added \"and maturing not more than twenty years from the date of issuance\" at the end of the first sentence, inserted \"as provided in Section 3-33-22 NMSA 1978 or placing the preliminary lien as provided in Section 3-33-11 NMSA\" in Paragraph (1) and inserted \"or placing the preliminary lien\" in Paragraph (2); and in Subsection C, added Paragraph (2), designated former Paragraphs (2) and (3) as Paragraphs (3) and (4), substituted \"project described in Subsection A of Section 3-33-3 NMSA 1978\" for \"street, alley, curb, gutter or sidewalk project\" in the first full sentence in Paragraph (4), and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nConstruction of statute.— Statute was remedial in nature and did not impair the obligation of contract, and had application to bonds issued prior to its enactment.City of Albuquerque v. Middle Rio Grande Conservancy Dist., 1941-NMSC-021, 45 N.M. 313, 115 P.2d 66 (1941);Gray v. City of Santa Fe, 15 F. Supp. 1074 (D.N.M. 1936),modified and aff'd, 89 F.2d 406 (10th Cir. 1937).\n\nValidation of bonds previously issued.— Legislature specifically authorized \"paving bonds\" to be issued by municipalities, and ratified, approved and confirmed, as valid obligations, any bonds theretofore issued by any municipalities for the purpose of paying the costs of such improvement as though the same were issued under the provisions of this section.Hodges v. City of Roswell, 1926-NMSC-016, 31 N.M. 384, 247 P. 310.\n\nVote of electors required.— Obligation prescribed by applicable statute and certificates that city guarantee payment of deficiency in special assessment fund from the general revenues of the city was not within the constitutional power of the city without a vote of the qualified electors as required by N.M. Const., art. IX, § 12.Purcell v. City of Carlsbad, 126 F.2d 748 (10th Cir. 1942).\n\nNotice of statutory provisions.— All parties, including holders of municipal bonds, are chargeable with notice of the statutes and ordinances governing the issue. The recitals in the bonds are insufficient to give such notice.State ex rel. Ackerman v. City of Carlsbad, 1935-NMSC-053, 39 N.M. 352, 47 P.2d 865.\n\nCertificates were debts.— Town sewer certificates, were debts within provision of constitution.Henning v. Town of Hot Springs, 1939-NMSC-029, 44 N.M. 321, 102 P.2d 25.\n\nDebt must be fixed and certain.— Sewer construction debt must be fixed, definite and certain in amount at time it was incurred.Henning v. Town of Hot Springs, 1939-NMSC-029, 44 N.M. 321, 102 P.2d 25.\n\nPayment of deficiency held void.— The guaranty of a city to pay to the holders of sewer certificates payable out of assessments any deficiency not met by the assessments was void, in view of N.M. Const., art. IX, § 12.City of Santa Fe v. First Nat'l Bank, 1937-NMSC-009, 41 N.M. 130, 65 P.2d 857.\n\nNegotiable coupon bond which provided for interest \"from date until payment\"authorized payment of interest after maturity.Munro v. City of Albuquerque, 1939-NMSC-043, 43 N.M. 334, 93 P.2d 993.\n\nLimitations on interest.— Where a city issued special paving assessment bonds with coupons calling for 6% interest until maturity, and providing that upon default all should at once become due and should draw 1% per month, the provisions could not be enforced, since interest was limited by law to 8%, and the city could not be compelled to pay more than 8%.Munro v. City of Albuquerque, 1939-NMSC-043, 43 N.M. 334, 93 P.2d 993.\n\nBonds should not be surrendered and marked \"paid and discharged\"until all accumulated interest is paid.Munro v. City of Albuquerque, 1939-NMSC-043, 43 N.M. 334, 93 P.2d 993.\n\nSale of bonds.— Nothing in the provisions of this section would prevent the sale of special improvement bonds below par and interest accrued thereon.Stone v. City of Hobbs, 1950-NMSC-032, 54 N.M. 237, 220 P.2d 704.\n\nDiscount on bonds.— Discount on special street improvement bonds must be treated as an incidental expense which may be assessed against the property situated in the improvement district.Stone v.

If the governing body fails or refuses to foreclose and sell a tract or parcel of land for the delinquent assessment or installment of the assessment as required in Section 3-33-26 NMSA 1978, any holder of a bond or assignable certificate secured by the assessment may foreclose the assessment lien on such delinquent property in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real estate.\n\nB. Any person holding two or more assignable certificates issued as authorized in Section 3-33-24 NMSA 1978 may sue in the same action on all tracts or parcels of land described in the certificate to enforce the lien against the tract or parcel of land described in the certificate unless the assessment lien has been adjusted pursuant to Section 3-33-23 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. Whenever a governing body, board of county commissioners or local board of education is delinquent in the payment of an assessment, the holder of any assignable certificate issued against the tract or parcel of land of the municipality, county or school district has the rights and remedies for the collection of the assessment as are given by law for the collection of judgments against municipalities, counties and school districts.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-32-18, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300; 1991, ch. 199, § 16.\n\nCross references.— For municipal liens,see3-36-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor foreclosure of mortgages,see39-5-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective April 4, 1991, in Subsection A, substituted \"3-33-26 NMSA 1978\" for \"14-32-19 New Mexico Statutes Annotated, 1953 Compilation\" and inserted \"or assignable certificate\" and, in Subsection B, substituted \"3-33-24 NMSA 1978\" for \"14-32-17 New Mexico Statutes Annotated, 1953 Compilation\" and added \"unless the assessment lien has been adjusted pursuant to Section 3-33-23 NMSA 1978\" at the end.\n\nThis statute provides the exclusive remedy for the enforcement of assessmentsfor paving bonds, and the court erred in appointing a receiver to take over and administer the town's assets and perform town's duties to collect assessments.State ex rel. Lynch v. District Court, 1937-NMSC-072, 41 N.M. 658, 73 P.2d 333.\n\nAgreement by a city to collect improvement assessments and apply proceeds in payment of the bonds was valid;the city could be compelled by mandamus to perform that duty and agreement.Gray v. City of Santa Fe, 89 F.2d 406 (10th Cir. 1937).\n\nDuty of certificate holder.— Though the city is empowered to foreclose liens against delinquent assessments, a duty is imposed on the certificate holder either to bring mandamus against the city to perform this responsibility, or to bring foreclosure proceedings in his own name within the period of limitations.Munro v. City of Albuquerque, 1943-NMSC-050, 48 N.M. 306, 150 P.2d 733.\n\nExhaustion of remedies by bondholder.— Any liability of the municipality in connection with the breach of its express duty in the collection of special assessments is contingent upon and subject first to the corresponding duty of the bondholder or certificate holder to exhaust all remedies available to him: (1) to mandate the municipality to perform its express or statutory duty, and (2) to enforce in its own name and right the collection of the assessments by foreclosure proceedings when so authorized.Purcell v. City of Carlsbad, 126 F.2d 748 (10th Cir. 1942).\n\nDuty of bondholder.— Whether assessments are delinquent and whether the city has failed or declined to enforce collection by foreclosing the assessment liens must be ascertained by the bondholder at his peril. The bondholder has to show that the city failed or refused to proceed after the assessment became delinquent.Munro v. City of Albuquerque, 1943-NMSC-050, 48 N.M. 306, 150 P.2d 733.\n\nThe bondholder is under no duty to act in his own behalf until he has notice of the breach of the obligations by the default of the interest or principal on the bond, of which he was the owner or holder, unless it is shown that by some other circumstances, the bondholder was apprised of the breach, in which event it becomes his duty to timely act.Gray v. City of Santa Fe, 135 F.2d 374 (10th Cir. 1941).\n\nNotice of rights of bondholder.— Since this statute has given the bondholder a remedy under appropriate circumstances, it acts as notice of his rights and the limitations thereon, and he is placed on inquiry as to whether such circumstances may have arisen.Munro v. City of Albuquerque, 1943-NMSC-050, 48 N.M. 306, 150 P.2d 733.\n\nAlternative remedies for enforcing collection.— Where city attorney failed to perform duties imposed upon him by the ordinances, to enforce collection of the amount due on assessments by foreclosure as provided by the ordinances, the bondholders had the alternative remedies of enforcing the collection by a suit to foreclose in their own behalf, or mandamus to compel the city to perform its trust obligation.Gray v. City of Santa Fe, 135 F.2d 374 (10th Cir. 1943).\n\nMunicipality is liable for damages caused by shrinkage in valueof assessed property from the date on which it becomes obligated to enforce collection of assessments by foreclosure and the date on which it becomes the duty of the bondholders either to enforce collection of the assessments in their own behalf, or to compel the city by mandamus to perform its trust obligation, together with costs of the proceedings.Gray v.

If more than one improvement district is created, the money from assessments in each district shall be kept in a separate fund and used for the payment of principal and interest of the bonds or assignable certificates outstanding against that improvement district.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-32-19, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300; 1991, ch. 199, § 17.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective April 4, 1991, deleted \"negotiable coupon\" preceding \"bonds\" in three places and, in Subsection A, substituted \"when due\" for \"annually or semiannually\" at the end of Paragraph (2), designated former Subparagraph (d) of Paragraph (4) as Paragraph (5), and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nOrdinance cumulative of statute.— The promise of the city in paving ordinance to enforce collection of assessments is only promising to perform the very services which the statute pursuant to which the ordinances were passed says the municipality should perform and is cumulative only.Munro v.

City of Santa Fe, 135 F.2d 374 (10th Cir. 1943).\n\nThe city's only obligation to sewer certificate holdersis to handle the fund created by sewer assessments according to the contract and its liability under the contract is measured by the statutes which authorized it.Purcell v.

Any bonds that are refunded under the provisions of this section shall be paid at maturity or on any permitted prior redemption date in the amounts, at the time and places and, if called prior to maturity, in accordance with any applicable notice provisions, all as provided in the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the refunded bonds or otherwise appertaining thereto, except for any such bond that is voluntarily surrendered for exchange or payment by the holder or owner.\n\nB. Provision shall be made for paying the refunded bonds at the time or times provided in Subsection A of this section.\n\nC. The proceeds of refunding bonds, including any accrued interest and premium appertaining to the sale of refunding bonds, shall either be immediately applied to the retirement of the refunded bonds or be placed in escrow in a commercial bank or trust company that possesses and is exercising trust powers and that is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation, to be applied to the payment of the principal of, interest on and any prior redemption premium due in connection with the refunded bonds; provided that such refunding bond proceeds, including any accrued interest and any premium appertaining to a sale of refunding bonds may be applied to the establishment and maintenance of a reserve fund and to the payment of expenses incidental to the refunding and the issuance of the refunding bonds, the interest thereon and the principal thereof or both interest and principal as the municipality may determine. Nothing in this section requires the establishment of an escrow if the refunded bonds become due and payable within one year from the date of the refunding bonds and if the amounts necessary to retire the refunded bonds within that time are deposited with the paying agent for the refunded bonds. Any such escrow shall not necessarily be limited to proceeds of refunding bonds but may include other money available for its purpose. Any proceeds in escrow pending such use may be invested or reinvested in bills, certificates of indebtedness, notes or bonds that are direct obligations of or the principal and interest of which obligations are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America or in certificates of deposit of banks that are members of the federal deposit insurance corporation, the par value of which certificates of deposit is collateralized by a pledge of obligations of or the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America, the par value of which obligations is at least seventy-five percent of the par value of the certificates of deposit. Such proceeds and investments in escrow together with any interest or other income to be derived from any such investment shall be in an amount at all times sufficient as to principal, interest, any prior redemption premium due and any charges of the escrow agent payable therefrom to pay the refunded bonds as they become due at their respective maturities or due at any designated prior redemption date or dates in connection with which the municipality shall exercise a prior redemption option. Any purchaser of any refunding bond issued under Sections 3-33-39 through 3-33-42 NMSA 1978 is in no manner responsible for the application of the proceeds thereof by the municipality or any of its officers, agents or employees.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 3-33-40, enacted by Laws 1991, ch. 199, § 27.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1991, ch. 199, § 27 repealed 3-33-40 NMSA 1978, as enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300, relating to improvement district, default, petition of bondholders, exchange, and enacted a new section, effective April 4, 1991.",
