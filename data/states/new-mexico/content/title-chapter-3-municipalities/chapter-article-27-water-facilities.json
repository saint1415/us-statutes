Within twenty days following the filing of the petition, the condemnee may elect to proceed through an arbitration process pursuant to the Uniform Arbitration Act by filing a written notice with the condemnor. The arbitrators may award an amount they find to be just compensation for the condemnation of the water or water rights. The arbitrators may decide that the interests of justice are not served by permitting the taking of the condemnee's water or water rights and may order that the arbitration be dismissed and that the property not be taken by the municipality. If the award of the arbitrators exceeds the amount offered by the condemnor pursuant to this subsection by more than one hundred fifteen percent, or if the arbitrators decide that no taking shall occur as permitted in this subsection, or if the arbitration is abandoned by the condemnor, then the arbitrators shall award reasonable and necessary arbitration expenses, including attorney fees, to the condemnee.\n\nG.
