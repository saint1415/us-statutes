The notice of lien shall include:\n\n(1) the number of the ordinance under which the lien is established;\n\n(2) the fact that a lien is established;\n\n(3) the general purpose of the lien;\n\n(4) the name of the owner of the property against which the lien is established as determined from the records of the county assessor;\n\n(5) a description of the property against which the lien is established;\n\n(6) the amount of the lien; and\n\n(7) if the lien is for more than one period of time, the date for which the lien is established.\n\nB. A lien for charges or assessments which are provided for or fixed by any one ordinance or under authority of law may be included in the same notice of lien, and it shall not be necessary to file separate liens against the separate properties. The lien shall be attested in the name of the municipal clerk under the seal of the municipality.\n\nC.

Conceding that city was authorized to foreclose liens for delinquent assessments, the same right and duty was imposed upon certificate holders.

At the trial of any case foreclosing any lien, the recitals of the lien or other evidence of indebtedness shall be received in evidence as prima facie true.

The district courts shall have jurisdiction of actions authorized by this section.\n\nD. Whenever it shall appear that a lien as defined herein, or any installments thereon, has been due and unpaid and is delinquent after the date said assessment or other legal charge became a lien, the municipality may elect to declare the total amount due and payable and such lien may be foreclosed in the manner provided herein notwithstanding the provisions of any other general or special law. An election to declare the total amount due and payable shall not constitute an acceleration of the payment for the purpose of the statute of limitation and the statute of limitation shall not commence to run until the last installment would normally come due.\n\n(1) The director of finance or other municipal officer designated by the governing body to collect and receive payments due on municipal liens shall, from time to time, submit to the municipal clerk a list of tracts or parcels of land against which the municipality holds a lien and a payment or any installments due thereon have been unpaid and are delinquent.

Upon the filing of the notice of foreclosure the municipal clerk shall forthwith cause a copy thereof to be published once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper published in or having general circulation within the county in which the property affected is located.\n\nF.

It shall not be necessary for the municipality to plead or prove the various steps, procedures and notices taken prior to the enactment of an ordinance imposing an assessment, or other lawful charges against the lands described in the notice of foreclosure and all such assessments or other lawful charges shall be presumed to be valid. A defendant alleging any jurisdictional defect or invalidity in the assessment or other lawful charge must particularly specify in his answer such defect or invalidity and must affirmatively establish such defense.\n\nI.

Upon such trial, proof that such assessment or other charges was [were] paid, together with any penalties and interest costs which may have been due or that the property was not legally subject to the assessment or charges, shall constitute a complete defense.

The municipality may at any time prior to final judgment, withdraw any parcel from a proceeding under this section where the liens and other charges have been paid up to date or paid in full or in cases where a parcel was listed on the notice of foreclosure in error, or where the municipality has accepted a deed in lieu of foreclosure.\n\nM. Sale of property foreclosed under this procedure. No real property foreclosed under this procedure shall be sold to satisfy a delinquent assessment until at least fifteen days after the date of judgment or decree of the court within which time the owner, mortgage holder or other parties having an interest in the tract or parcel of land may pay off the judgment or decree and avoid the sale. Thereafter, the municipality may sell the property at public or private sale, subject to the right of redemption, ad valorem taxes and other special assessments having a lien on the property which is coequal with the lien for ad valorem taxes.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-35-6, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 379, § 1; 1977, ch. 190, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nSeverability clauses.— Laws 1977, ch. 190, § 2, provided for the severability of the act if any part or application thereof is held invalid.",
