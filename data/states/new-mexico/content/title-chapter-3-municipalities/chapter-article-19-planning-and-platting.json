Santa Fe City Council, 226 F.3d 1207 (10th Cir. 2000).\n\nLegislative and quasi-judicial proceedings.— In consolidated appeals arising from petitioners' collective opposition to the development of the proposed Santolina planned community on Albuquerque's west side mesa in Bernalillo county, where the Bernalillo county board of county commissioners (board) approved a master plan for the development of the Santolina community and a zone map amendment which rezoned the land from rural agricultural to planned community zoning, despite claims from petitioners that they were deprived of an impartial tribunal, and where the district court affirmed the board's approval of the master plan, holding that such was a legislative action, but also held that the board's consideration and approval of the zone map amendment was a quasi-judicial action requiring an impartial tribunal, the district court did not err in affirming the board's approval of the master plan, which reflected a broad, area-wide policy regarding future development of a large-scale planned community, and in finding that such action was legislative in nature, nor did the district court err in finding that the board's proceedings regarding the zone map amendment were quasi-judicial, because the zone map amendment affects only a specific area of identifiable property and alters that property's zoning in a manner distinct from surrounding properties and the county at large. As a quasi-judicial proceeding, petitioners were entitled to due process, including a fair and impartial hearing.Benavidez v. Bernalillo Cnty. Bd. of Comm'rs, 2021-NMCA-029, cert. denied.\n\nAdvisory nature of municipal master plans.— The New Mexico legislature intended any master plan adopted by a municipality to be advisory in nature.Dugger v.

The subdivision regulations shall be approved by the governing body before they become effective. The subdivision regulations may provide for:\n\n(1) the harmonious development of the municipality and its environs;\n\n(2) the coordination of streets within the subdivision with existing or planned streets or other features of the master plan or official map of the municipality;\n\n(3) adequate open space for traffic, recreation, drainage, light and air; and\n\n(4) the distribution of population and traffic which tend to create conditions favorable to the health, safety, convenience, prosperity or general welfare of the residents of the municipality.\n\nB. Subdivision regulations may govern:\n\n(1) the width of streets;\n\n(2) the width, depth and arrangement of lots;\n\n(3) land use, including natural drainage;\n\n(4) other matters necessary to carry out the purposes of the Municipal Code; and\n\n(5) the extent and manner in which:\n\n(a) streets are graded and improved; and\n\n(b) water, sewer and other utility facilities are installed as a condition precedent to the approval of a plat.\n\nC. The subdivision regulations or the practice of the planning commission may allow tentative approval of the plat previous to the completion of improvements and the installation of utility facilities but such tentative approval shall not be entered on a plat. In lieu of the completion of improvements and the installation of utility facilities previous to the final approval of a plat, the subdivision regulations may provide for:\n\n(1) assessment or other methods whereby the municipality makes the improvements and installations at the cost of the owner of property within the subdivision; or\n\n(2) acceptance of a bond, in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to the planning commission, securing to the municipality the actual construction and installation of improvements and utility facilities within a period of time specified by the planning commission and expressed in the bond. A municipality may enforce such a bond by all appropriate and legal remedies; or\n\n(3) in lieu of a bond, the municipality may enter into an agreement with a person seeking approval of a subdivision whereby the person seeking approval shall, within two years following final approval of the plat, complete the improvements and the installation of utility facilities provided for in the person's application for subdivision approval, except that the agreement set forth herein may provide that the person seeking approval shall be permitted by the municipality to sell or otherwise dispose of, or improve any lot within the subdivision, to which improvements and utility facilities have been provided by the person seeking approval at any time within the two-year period; any such agreement shall be recorded with the county clerk at the time of filing said plat.\n\nD. The governing body or planning commission of the municipality shall hold a public hearing on the adoption of a subdivision regulation or an amendment to it. Notice of the time and place of the public hearing shall be published once at least fifteen days prior to the date of the public hearing.\n\nE. If the requirement or restriction does not violate the zoning ordinance, the governing body or planning commission of the municipality may agree with a person seeking approval of a subdivision upon the use, height, area or bulk requirement or restriction governing buildings and premises within the subdivision. The requirement or restriction shall:\n\n(1) accompany the plat before it is approved and recorded;\n\n(2) have the force of law;\n\n(3) be enforced; and\n\n(4) be subject to amendment or repeal as the provisions of the zoning ordinance and map are enforced, amended or repealed.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-18-6, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300; 1975, ch. 309, § 1.\n\nNo vested development rights under impact fee ordinance.— Where the municipal impact fee ordinance exempted developers who possessed development rights that vested prior to the ordinance's date of enactment from paying the impact fee; prior to the date the ordinance was enacted, the municipal planning commission approved a site plan for subdivision of land owned by plaintiff; the approved plan established zoning, tract boundaries, vehicle access, bicycle and trail access, public transit access, internal circulation requirements, building heights, setbacks, and common landscape standards; none of the tracts were platted; and the regulations that were promulgated pursuant to the ordinance defined vested rights as development rights acquired and resulting from building permit approval, final plat approval, preliminary plat approval, or site plan for subdivision or site plan for building permit approval and defined site plan for subdivision as a plat, which covers at least one lot and specifies access and building criteria, under the ordinance, a developer receives development rights at the time it receives approval of a reliable platting pattern, the developer's original site plan for subdivision did not confer the development rights necessary to establish vested rights under the ordinance, because it did not provide a reliable platting pattern, and the developer was not exempt from paying impact fees.Andalucia Dev. Corp., Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 2010-NMCA-052, 148 N.M. 277, 234 P.3d 929.\n\nNo common law vested development rights.— Where the municipal impact fee ordinance exempted developers who possessed development rights that vested prior to the ordinance's date of enactment from paying the impact fee; prior to the date the ordinance was enacted, the municipal planning commission approved a site plan for subdivision of land owned by plaintiff; the approved plan established zoning, tract boundaries, vehicle access, bicycle and trail access, public transit access, internal circulation requirements, building heights, setbacks, and common landscape standards; none of the tracts were platted; and development of the property was subject to subsequent municipal approvals and the continuance of the project remained entirely within the municipality's discretion, the original site plan for subdivision did not confer a vested development right under common law and the developer was not exempt from paying impact fees.Andalucia Dev. Corp., Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 2010-NMCA-052, 148 N.M. 277, 234 P.3d 929.\n\nThis section did not give municipality the right to exact from subdivider a $50.00 fee per lot subdividedto be used generally for improvements to the subdivision, where no specific directions were given for the use of money so accumulated.Sanchez v.

The court is not required to indulge every inference in favor of an agency action but, on the contrary, is required to exercise its own judgment in light of the agency decision and the evidence presented to it at trial. At the conclusion, the court has the power to order the approval of a request, rather than merely vacating the agency decision and remanding for further proceedings.Clayton v.

The planning commission may adopt:\n\n(1) the master plan by a single resolution; or\n\n(2) part of the master plan as work progresses on the master plan; provided the part corresponds with one of the functional subdivisions of the subject matter of the plan. Before adoption of the master plan or any part thereof, the planning commission shall hold at least one public hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be published one time at least fifteen days before the day of the hearing. Prior to the publication of the notice, copies of the master plan shall be made available to any citizen in the office of the municipal clerk.\n\nB. Adoption of the master plan or any part, amendment or addition to the master plan shall be by a resolution approved by a majority of the members of the planning commission. The resolution shall refer expressly to the maps, descriptive matter and other matters which the planning commission intends to form part or the whole of the master plan. The action taken by the planning commission shall be recorded on the master plan or the part of the plan and shall be endorsed by the chairman and the secretary of the planning commission.

      "text": "A. After a master plan or any part thereof has been approved and within the area of the master plan or any part thereof so approved, the approval of the planning commission is necessary to construct, authorize, accept, widen, narrow, remove, extend, relocate, vacate, abandon, acquire or change the use of any:\n\n(1) park, street or other public way, ground, place or space;\n\n(2) public building or structure; or\n\n(3) utility, whether publicly or privately owned.\n\nB. The failure of the planning commission to act within sixty-five days after the submission of a proposal to it constitutes approval of the proposal unless the proponent agrees to an extension of time. If the planning commission disapproves a proposal, it must state its reasons to the governing body. The governing body may overrule the planning commission and approve the proposal by a two-thirds vote of all its members.\n\nC. None of the provisions of Chapter 3, Article 19 NMSA 1978 shall apply to any existing building, structure, plant or other equipment owned or used by any public utility or the right to its continued use or its reasonable repair or alteration for the purpose for which it was used at the time the master plan or any part thereof affecting the property takes effect. After the adoption of the master plan or any part thereof affecting the property, all extensions, betterments or additions to buildings, structures, plants or other equipment of any public utility shall be made in conformity with the master plan or any part thereof affecting the property and upon the approval of the planning commission. After a public hearing, the state corporation commission [public regulation commission] or the New Mexico public utility commission [public regulation commission] or the regulatory agency having jurisdiction or their successors having jurisdiction, as the case may be, may order that the extensions, betterments or additions to buildings, structures, plants or other equipment are reasonable and that the extensions, betterments or additions may be made even though they conflict with the adopted master plan or any part thereof affecting the property.\n\nD. Any public agency or official, not under the jurisdiction of the governing body of the municipality, authorizing or financing a public way, ground, place, space, building, structure or utility shall submit the proposal to the planning commission. If the planning commission disapproves the proposal, the board of the public agency by a two-thirds vote of all its members or the official may overrule the planning commission and proceed with the proposal subject to the provisions of Subsection C of this section.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-18-11, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300; 1993, ch. 282, § 3.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler. It was not enacted by the legislature and is not part of the law.\n\nLaws 1998, ch. 108, § 80 provided that references to the state corporation commission and the public utility commission be construed as references to the public regulation commission.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, in Subsection C, substituted \"Chapter 3, Article 19 NMSA 1978\" for \"Sections 14-18-1 through 14-18-12 New Mexico Statutes Annotated, 1953 Compilation\" in the first sentence, and in the last sentence, substituted \"the state corporation commission\" for \"the New Mexico corporation commission\" and substituted \"New Mexico public utility commission\" for \"New Mexico public service commission\"; and substituted \"provisions of Subsection C of this section\" for \"provisions of the preceding Subsection C\" in Subsection D.\n\nA city has no zoning authority beyond its corporate limits.City of Carlsbad v.
