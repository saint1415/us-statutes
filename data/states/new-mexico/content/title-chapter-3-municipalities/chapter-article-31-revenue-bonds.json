      "text": "A. In addition to any other law and constitutional home rule powers authorizing a municipality to issue revenue bonds, a municipality may issue revenue bonds pursuant to Chapter 3, Article 31 NMSA 1978 for the purposes specified in this section.\n\nB. Utility revenue bonds may be issued for acquiring, extending, enlarging, bettering, repairing or otherwise improving a municipal utility or for any combination of the foregoing purposes. The municipality may pledge irrevocably any or all of the net revenues from the operation of the municipal utility or of any one or more of other such municipal utilities for payment of the interest on and principal of the revenue bonds.\n\nC. Joint utility revenue bonds may be issued for acquiring, extending, enlarging, bettering, repairing or otherwise improving joint water facilities, sewer facilities, gas facilities or electric facilities or for any combination of the foregoing purposes. The municipality may pledge irrevocably any or all of the net revenues from the operation of these municipal utilities for the payment of the interest on and principal of the bonds.\n\nD. Gross receipts tax revenue bonds may be issued for any municipal purpose. A municipality may pledge irrevocably any or all of the gross receipts tax revenue received by the municipality pursuant to Section 7-1-6.4 or 7-1-6.12 NMSA 1978 to the payment of the interest on and principal of the gross receipts tax revenue bonds or for any area of municipal government services. A law that imposes or authorizes the imposition of a tax authorized by the Municipal Local Option Gross Receipts Taxes Act [Chapter 7, Article 19D NMSA 1978] or that affects the tax, or a law supplemental thereto or otherwise appertaining thereto, shall not be repealed or amended or otherwise directly or indirectly modified in such a manner as to impair adversely any outstanding revenue bonds that may be secured by a pledge of such tax unless the outstanding revenue bonds have been discharged in full or provision has been fully made therefor. Revenues in excess of the annual principal and interest due on gross receipts tax revenue bonds secured by a pledge of gross receipts tax revenue may be accumulated in a debt service reserve account. The governing body of the municipality may appoint a commercial bank trust department to act as trustee of the gross receipts tax revenue and to administer the payment of principal of and interest on the bonds.\n\nE.

The municipality may pledge irrevocably any or all of the net revenues from the operation of the revenue-producing project for which the particular project revenue bonds are issued to the payment of the interest on and principal of the project revenue bonds. The net revenues of any revenue-producing project may not be pledged to the project revenue bonds issued for a revenue-producing project that clearly is unrelated in nature; but nothing in this subsection shall prevent the pledge to such project revenue bonds of any revenues received from existing, future or disconnected facilities and equipment that are related to and that may constitute a part of the particular revenue-producing project. A general determination by the governing body that any facilities or equipment is reasonably related to and constitutes a part of a specified revenue-producing project shall be conclusive if set forth in the proceedings authorizing the project revenue bonds.\n\nG. Fire district revenue bonds may be issued for acquiring, extending, enlarging, bettering, repairing, improving, constructing, purchasing, furnishing, equipping and rehabilitating any fire district project, including, where applicable, purchasing, otherwise acquiring or improving the ground therefor, or for any combination of the foregoing purposes.

The revenues of any fire district project shall not be pledged to the bonds issued for a fire district project that clearly is unrelated in its purpose; but nothing in this section prevents the pledge to such bonds of any revenues received from existing, future or disconnected facilities and equipment that are related to and that may constitute a part of the particular fire district project.

However, any period of time during which a particular revenue bond issue is in litigation shall not be counted in determining the expiration date of that issue.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-30-1, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 395, § 3; 1979, ch. 311, § 1; 1981, ch. 6, § 1; 1982, ch. 38, § 1; 1983, ch. 57, § 1; 1985, ch. 81, § 8; 1985, ch. 86, § 1; 1989, ch. 356, § 1; 1990, ch. 99, § 43; 1991, ch. 9, § 8; 1995, ch. 141, § 1; 1998, ch. 90, § 1; 1999, ch. 199, § 1; 2007, ch. 148, § 2; 2019, ch. 274, § 1.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1973, ch. 395, § 3, repealed former 14-30-1, 1953 Comp., relating to issuance of revenue bonds, and enacted a new 14-30-1, 1953 Comp.\n\nCross references.— For revenue bond issues of water or natural gas associations,see3-28-10 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor the Pollution Control Revenue Bond Act,see3-59-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor destruction of documentary evidence of extinguished public debt,see6-10-62 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the Municipal Local Option Gross Receipts Taxes Act,see7-19D-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective July 1, 2019, provided that gross receipts tax revenue bonds may be issued for any municipal purpose, removed provisions specifying purposes for which gross receipts tax revenue bonds may be issued, removed the definitions of certain terms as used in Chapter 3, Article 31 NMSA 1978, and removed provisions related to economic development gross receipts tax revenue bonds and municipal higher education facilities gross receipts tax revenue bonds; added new subsection designation \"A\" and redesignated former Subsections A through C as Subsections B through D, respectively; in Subsection A, deleted the last sentence which defined \"pledged revenues\"; in Subsection B, deleted \"These bonds are sometimes referred to in Chapter 3, Article 31 NMSA 1978 as 'utility revenue bonds' or 'utility bonds'\"; in Subsection C, deleted \"These bonds are sometimes referred to in Chapter 3, Article 31 NMSA 1978 as 'utility revenue bonds' or 'utility bonds'\"; in Subsection D, deleted \"For the purposes of this subsection, 'gross receipts tax revenue bonds' means gross receipts tax revenue bonds or sales tax revenue bonds.\", and after \"bonds may be issued for any\", deleted the remainder of the introductory clause and deleted former Paragraphs (1) through (10) and added \"municipal purpose.

If a municipality or county has issued a revenue bond that is secured by a pledge of a tax being amended or repealed by this act, the revenue received by the municipality or county is impressed with the obligation to repay the outstanding bond and is dedicated to that repayment until the bond is fully discharged or otherwise provided for in full.\n\nC. If a municipality or county has dedicated any amount of revenue attributable to a tax being amended or repealed by this act, the municipality or county shall continue to dedicate the same amount of revenue attributable to the tax until the ordinance dedicating the revenue expires, the term of the dedication expires, the governing body acts to change the dedication or, in the case of bonded indebtedness, the debt is fully discharged or otherwise provided for in full.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective July 1, 2007, added Subsection J providing for municipal higher education facilities gross receipts tax revenue bonds.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective April 6, 1999, rewrote the second undesignated paragraph following Subsection C(10), relating to accumulation of revenues in excess of the annual principal and interest due on gross receipts tax revenue bonds secured by a pledge of gross receipts tax revenue into debt service reserve accounts, substituted \"the Fire Protection Fund Law\" for \"Sections 59A-53-1 through 59A-53-17 NMSA 1978\" in Subsection G, and substituted \"the Law Enforcement Protection Fund Act\" for \"Sections 29-13-1 through 29-13-9 NMSA 1978\" in Subsection H, and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective May 20, 1998, added Paragraph C(10); in the undesignated paragraph following Paragraph C(10), substituted \"7-1-6.4 or 7-1-6.12 NMSA 1978\" for \"7-1-6.4, 7-1-6.12 or 7-19A-6 NMSA 1978 or pursuant to Municipal Infrastructure Gross Receipts Tax Act\" and \"Subsection C\" for \"Subsection B\" in the first sentence; added the undesignated paragraph immediately preceding Subsection D; in Subsection D, in the first sentence, inserted \"municipal\" preceding \"jails\" and \"regional jails or juvenile detention facilities\" preceding \", libraries\", at the end of the second sentence, substituted \"the Municipal Local Option Gross Receipts Taxes Act\" for \"Section 7-19-4 NMSA 1978\"; in Subsection E, deleted \"7-1-6.14\" following \"7-1-6.9\"; added Subsection I and redesignated former Subsection I as Subsection J; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective April 5, 1995, substituted \"Subsections A through I\" for \"Subsections A through F\" in the introductory paragraph, deleted \"making additions to\" in Paragraph (6) of Subsection C, substituted \"Section 7-19D-9\" for Section 7-19-4\" in the first sentence of the second paragraph in Subsection C, substituted \"includes but is not\" for \"shall include but shall not be\" and substituted \"Subsection C of this section\" for \"this Subsection\" in Subsection D, added the last sentence in Subsection D, added Subsections G and H, redesignated former Subsection G as Subsection I, inserted \"or, for bonds to be issued and sold to the New Mexico finance authority as authorized in Subsection C of Section 3-31-4 NMSA 1978, after the expiration of two years from the date of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds\" in the first sentence of Subsection I, and made a minor stylistic change in the second paragraph of Subsection C.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective July 1, 1991, in the first sentence of the final paragraph of Subsection C, inserted \"or pursuant to the Municipal Infrastructure Gross Receipts Tax Act\" and made related stylistic changes, and made minor stylistic changes in Paragraph (5) of Subsection C and in Subsection F.\n\nThe 1990 amendment,effective March 5, 1990, in Paragraph (9) of Subsection C, inserted \"constructing\" and \"solid waste facilities\" in the first paragraph and made minor stylistic changes in the third paragraph thereof.\n\nObligations payable from special funds.— Revenues derived from the county's share of the gross receipts and gasoline taxes are within the special fund doctrine, since the legislature has expressly authorized the use of such funds for the issuance of revenue bonds.Bolton v.

Any bonds that are refunded under the provisions of this section shall be paid at maturity or on any permitted prior redemption date in the amounts, at the time and places and, if called prior to maturity, in accordance with any applicable notice provisions, all as provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the refunded bonds or otherwise appertaining thereto, except for any such bond that is voluntarily surrendered for exchange or payment by the holder or owner.\n\nB. Provision shall be made for paying the bonds refunded at the time or times provided in Subsection A of this section. The principal amount of the refunding bonds may exceed the principal amount of the refunded bonds and may also be less than or the same as the principal amount of the bonds being refunded so long as provision is duly and sufficiently made for the payment of the refunded bonds.\n\nC. The proceeds of refunding bonds, including any accrued interest and premium appertaining to the sale of refunding bonds, shall either be immediately applied to the retirement of the bonds being refunded or be placed in escrow in a commercial bank or trust company, which possesses and is exercising trust powers and which is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation, to be applied to the payment of the principal of, interest on and any prior redemption premium due in connection with the bonds being refunded; provided that such refunding bond proceeds, including any accrued interest and any premium appertaining to a sale of refunding bonds, may be applied to the establishment and maintenance of a reserve fund and to the payment of expenses incidental to the refunding and the issuance of the refunding bonds, the interest thereon and the principal thereof or both interest and principal as the municipality may determine. Nothing in this section requires the establishment of an escrow if the refunded bonds become due and payable within one year from the date of the refunding bonds and if the amounts necessary to retire the refunded bonds within that time are deposited with the paying agent for the refunded bonds. Any such escrow shall not necessarily be limited to proceeds of refunding bonds but may include other money available for its purpose. Any proceeds in escrow pending such use may be invested or reinvested in bills, certificates of indebtedness, notes or bonds that are direct obligations of or the principal and interest of which obligations are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America or in certificates of deposit of banks that are members of the federal deposit insurance corporation, the par value of which certificates of deposit is collateralized by a pledge of obligations of or the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America, the par value of which obligations is at least seventy-five percent of the par value of the certificates of deposit. Such proceeds and investments in escrow together with any interest or other income to be derived from any such investment shall be in an amount at all times sufficient as to principal, interest, any prior redemption premium due and any charges of the escrow agent payable therefrom to pay the bonds being refunded as they become due at their respective maturities or due at any designated prior redemption date or dates in connection with which the municipality shall exercise a prior redemption option. Any purchaser of any refunding bond issued under Sections 3-31-1 through 3-31-12 NMSA 1978 is in no manner responsible for the application of the proceeds thereof by the municipality or any of its officers, agents or employees.\n\nD. Refunding bonds may bear such additional terms and provisions as may be determined by the municipality subject to the limitations in this section and Section 3-31-10 NMSA 1978 and, to the extent applicable, Sections 3-31-1 through 3-31-12 NMSA 1978 relating to original bond issues, and the refunding bonds are not subject to the provisions of any other statute except as may be incorporated by reference in Sections 3-31-1 through 3-31-12 NMSA 1978.\n\nE.
