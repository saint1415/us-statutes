The new business facility investment shall be determined by dividing by twelve the sum of the total value of such property on the last business day of each calendar month of the property tax year. If the new business facility is in operation for less than an entire property tax year, the new business facility investment shall be determined by dividing the sum of the total value of the property on the last business day of each full calendar month during the portion of the property tax year during which the new business facility was in operation by the number of full calendar months during that period.\n\nC. If a facility that does not constitute a new business facility is expanded by the taxpayer, the expansion shall be considered a separate facility eligible for the exemption authorized by Section 3-64-3 NMSA 1978 if:\n\n(1) the taxpayer's investment in the expansion exceeds one million dollars ($1,000,000) or, if less, one hundred percent of its investment in the original facility prior to expansion; and\n\n(2) the expansion otherwise constitutes a new business facility.\n\nThe taxpayer's investment in the expansion and in the original facility prior to expansion shall be determined in the manner provided in Paragraph (5) of Subsection A of this section.\n\nD.
