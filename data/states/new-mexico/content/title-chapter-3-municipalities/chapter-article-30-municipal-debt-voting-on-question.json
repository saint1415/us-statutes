The legislature finds that the provisions of Article 9, Section 12 of the constitution of New Mexico regarding nonresident municipal electors violate the rights of property owners who are not qualified electors of the county where such city, town or village is situated compared to nonresident property owners who are qualified electors of the county where such city, town or village is located, and further finds that providing voting rights based on property ownership violates the franchise provisions in Article 7, Section 1 of the constitution of New Mexico.\n\nB.
