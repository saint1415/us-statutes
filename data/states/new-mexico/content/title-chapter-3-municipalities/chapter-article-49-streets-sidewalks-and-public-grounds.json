Young, 1995-NMCA-002, 119 N.M. 324, 889 P.2d 1246, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 311, 889 P.2d 1233.\n\nA municipality does not have the authority to enforce a municipal DWI ordinance on private property without the written consent of the property owner.City of Las Cruces v. Rogers, 2009-NMSC-042, 146 N.M. 790, 215 P.3d 728.\n\nWhere a police officer followed defendant into the parking lot of a convenience store on the suspicion that defendant was intoxicated; the officer stopped defendant as defendant was preparing to leave the parking lot; defendant was arrested for violating a municipal DWI ordinance; the parking lot was private property; and the owner of the property had not given express written consent to the municipality to enforce the municipality's DWI ordinance within the property, the district court did not err in dismissing the DWI complaint against defendant.City of Las Cruces v. Rogers, 2009-NMSC-042, 146 N.M. 790, 215 P.3d 728.\n\nDelegation of police power.— Power to regulate use of streets is a delegation of the police power of the state government and whatever reasonably tends to make regulation effective is a proper exercise of that power.City of Roswell v. Mitchell, 1952-NMSC-027, 56 N.M. 201, 242 P.2d 493.\n\nRegulation by state transportation commission.— Statutory powers given to cities and towns do not give such municipalities absolute control over existing streets and proposed roads to the exclusion of the state highway commission [state transportation commission].Gallegos v.

State Hwy. Comm'n v. Ford, 1964-NMSC-037, 74 N.M. 18, 389 P.2d 865.\n\nWidening state highway.— A municipal ordinance, relative to widening a portion of state highway going through city and prohibiting parking on such portion of the highway, which was enacted following the execution of a cooperative agreement between the city and state highway department was not void as a bartering away of the exercise of city's police power.Farnsworth v. City of Roswell, 1957-NMSC-053, 63 N.M. 195, 315 P.2d 839.\n\nDuty of counties.— The duty to maintain and keep public highways in repair is that of the respective counties in which the highways are located, except for highways and streets in municipalities and state highways.Sanchez v.

Comm'rs, 1970-NMCA-058, 81 N.M. 644, 471 P.2d 678, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 668, 472 P.2d 382.\n\nLiability of municipality regarding regulating use of streets.— Regulating the use of streets by a municipality involves governmental and not corporate functions. There is no liability on the part of the municipality for an omission of duty in this respect, unless such liability is imposed by statute.Hammell v. City of Albuquerque, 1958-NMSC-005, 63 N.M. 374, 320 P.2d 384.\n\nLiability of municipality to keep streets and sidewalks in safe condition.— A municipality is under a legal duty to keep its streets and sidewalks in a reasonably safe condition for the use of the public, and for the negligent failure to perform this duty it is liable in tort to a person thereby injured.Hammell v. City of Albuquerque, 1958-NMSC-005, 63 N.M. 374, 320 P.2d 384.\n\nRegulation of parking.— A city has the power to regulate parking, even to the extent of prohibiting it in a proper case.Farnsworth v. City of Roswell, 1957-NMSC-053, 63 N.M. 195, 315 P.2d 839.\n\nA no parking regulation normally represents an exercise by a municipality of its police power and it is a reasonable regulation.Farnsworth v. City of Roswell, 1957-NMSC-053, 63 N.M. 195, 315 P.2d 839.\n\nParking meter ordinance.— Where parking meter ordinance was enacted primarily as a traffic regulation and not for the revenue incidental thereto, the ordinance was not unconstitutional or otherwise invalid because, incidentally, the city's receipts of money was increased.City of Roswell v. Mitchell, 1952-NMSC-027, 56 N.M. 201, 242 P.2d 493.\n\nImprovements.— City council has the power to plant shade trees, sprinkle the streets and erect drinking fountains, or otherwise improve the streets within its limits.Water Supply Co. v. City of Albuquerque, 1912-NMSC-038, 17 N.M. 326, 128 P. 77.\n\nSpecial assessments to pay cost of curbing.— The authority to establish and improve the streets granted city councils and boards of trustees, and to provide for and regulate crosswalks, curbs and gutters, did not grant the right, either expressly or by necessary implication, to levy a special assessment upon abutting owners to pay the cost of curbing a street.Albuquerque v. Zeiger, 1891-NMSC-014, 5 N.M. 674, 27 P. 315.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 39 Am.
