Att'y Gen. No. 69-106.\n\nThe fact that a mayor may have tendered to the city council a prospective resignationeffective at a future date does not compromise or defeat his legal authority to act as mayor until that date. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-106.\n\nWhen successor to resigning mayor acquires authority.— Although the city council may choose the successor to a resigning mayor before the effective date of the present mayor's resignation, the successor does not acquire any authority or power by way of that selection and may not assume such power or authority until the office becomes vacant. 1969 Op.

In all municipalities the mayor shall vote only when there is a tie vote.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-10-3, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300.\n\nDischarge of municipal employee.— In a mayor-council form of municipal government which has four councilmen and a mayor, who votes only to break a tie vote, where one councilman voted against the discharge of a municipal employee, while two councilmen and the mayor voted in favor of his termination, and one councilman was absent, the vote did not result in a valid discharge, which could only result from three councilmen voting in favor thereof, or a tie vote, broken by the mayor in favor of termination. However, it was not error for the trial court to concede that the vote was improper but nonetheless refuse to grant the equitable relief requested because even if the absent councilman had voted against termination there would have been a tie, which the mayor's vote would have broken.Abeyta v. Town of Taos, 499 F.2d 323 (10th Cir. 1974).\n\nA mayor is counted for purposes of a quorum,but his vote is counted only if there is a tie vote of the councilmen present at a meeting. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-148.\n\nMayor's voting rights.. — A mayor always has the right to break a tie vote even when a supermajority vote is required. This opinion letter overrules 1990 Op. Att'y Gen No. 90-02. 2003 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 03-02.\n\nThree-fourths vote requirement.— If a municipal ordinance requires the vote of three-fourths of the entire membership of the municipal board of trustees to decide a question, the mayor's vote is not counted in the event of tie. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-02, overruled by 2003 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 03-02.\n\nIn the case of a municipal zoning ordinance requiring the approval of three of the four trustees on the board of trustees, if only two of the trustees were to vote for a particular action, the mayor does not vote and the action is defeated. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-02, overruled by 2003 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 03-02.\n\nCouncilman presiding as mayor pro tem.— A councilman who is elected to preside over a meeting as mayor pro tem may vote, not as the mayor, who can only vote to break ties, but pursuant to his right to vote as a councilman. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-13.\n\nTie-breaking vote on choice of resigning mayor's successor.— A resigning mayor would be authorized to cast a deciding vote in the event of a tie on the choice of a successor. 1969 Op.

Gallegos, 812 F. Supp. 1165 (D.N.M. 1992).\n\nWarrantless arrest.— If the conduct of the plaintiff at the time appeared reasonably to the mayor and police chief to amount to a disturbance of the peace, or to be otherwise unlawful in its nature, committed as it was in the presence of the mayor and chief of police, then they were authorized to arrest the plaintiff without a warrant.Cherry v. Williams, 1957-NMSC-086, 63 N.M. 244, 316 P.2d 880.\n\nDual office holding.— The duties imposed upon the mayor by this section are not incompatible with those of a district attorney, and both offices may be filled by the same person contemporaneously.State ex rel. Chapman v. Truder, 1930-NMSC-049, 35 N.M. 49, 289 P. 594.\n\nLaw enforcement responsibilities of the mayor.— A mayor's authority to exercise \"powers conferred upon sheriffs of counties to suppress disorders and keep the peace\" gives the mayor some law enforcement functions but does not make the mayor a law enforcement officer. The limited law enforcement functions conferred upon a mayor under this section do not give the mayor discretionary authority over enforcement actions against, or prosecution of, persons who violate city ordinances, but, rather, a mayor may act to suppress disorders and keep the peace indirectly through the police.Authority of City Manager in a Mayor-Council Municipality(6/23/22), Att'y Gen.

At the organizational meeting of the governing body, the mayor shall submit, for confirmation by the governing body, the names of persons who shall fill the appointive offices of the municipality and the names of persons who shall be employed by the municipality. If the governing body fails to confirm any person as an appointive official or employee of the municipality, the mayor at the next regular meeting of the governing body shall submit the name of another person to fill the appointed office or to be employed by the municipality.\n\nB. Any person holding an appointed office at the time of the municipal election shall continue in that office until the person's successor has been appointed and is qualified.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 14-10-5, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 300; 1985, ch. 208, § 106; 2018, ch. 79, § 52.\n\nThe 2018 amendment,effective July 1, 2018, removed a reference to the repealed Municipal Election Code, and made a minor technical change; and in Subsection A, after \"meeting of the governing body\", deleted \"which shall be scheduled pursuant to Section 3-8-33 NMSA 1978 of the Municipal Election Code\".\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2018, ch. 79, § 174 provided that references in law to the Municipal Election Code and to the School Election Law shall be deemed to be references to the Local Election Act.\n\nThe 1985 amendmentsubstituted \"which shall be scheduled pursuant to Section 3-8-33 NMSA 1978 of the Municipal Election Code\" for \"which shall be held on the second Monday following the election\" near the beginning of Subsection A.\n\nConfirmation required.— The power to appoint being in the mayor, subject to \"confirmation by the governing body,\" there can be no appointment until the confirmation has been obtained.Arellano v. Lopez, 1970-NMSC-058, 81 N.M. 389, 467 P.2d 715.\n\nTerm of office of a chief of police.— A municipality's chief of police cannot have an indefinite term of office because the term is dependent on the results of each biennial municipal election, an appointment by the mayor at the organizational meeting following the election, and confirmation by the governing body. The term of office for a chief of police begins with the organizational meeting confirming the mayor's appointment and lasts until the next organizational meeting held following the next general election.City of Artesia v. PERA of N.M., 2014-NMCA-009, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-011.\n\nWhere the city appointed plaintiff as chief of police in September 2006 without specifying the end date of plaintiff's term of office; at the time of the appointment, plaintiff was a PERA retiree and 10-11-8(D) NMSA 1978 contained a chief of police exemption that permitted plaintiff to receive both a pension and a salary; in 2010, 10-11-8 NMSA 1978 was amended to remove the exemption and require that the pension of a PERA retiree appointed as chief of police after July 1, 2010 be suspended; defendant sought to suspend plaintiff's pension after the city's March 2012 election; and plaintiff claimed that because plaintiff's appointment was for an indefinite term, the exemption remained in effect until plaintiff's term of office terminated, plaintiff's term of office commenced following the March 2010 municipal election and ended when the city held its organizational meeting following the March 2012 election, because municipal appointees serve definitive terms of two years subject to reappointment at the municipality's organizational meeting following each biennial municipal election.City of Artesia v. PERA of N.M., 2014-NMCA-009, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-011.\n\nFailure to submit name at organizational meeting.— Subsection A of this section and Subsection A of 3-11-6 NMSA 1978 should be read in conjunction with one another; therefore, the failure of a mayor to submit a name to the governing body for appointment to office at the organizational meeting does not preclude him or her from doing so at subsequent meetings. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-74.\n\nEmployment of officers requires affirmation by absolute majority.— The employment of municipal officers and employees requires affirmation by an absolute majority of the city council regardless of how many members are present and voting. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-08.\n\nThis section specifically prohibits the naming of the same person for the same positionwhere the governing body has failed to confirm the name when first submitted. 1966 Op.

Subject to the approval of a majority of all members of the governing body, the mayor shall:\n\n(1) appoint all officers and employees except those holding elective office; and\n\n(2) designate an employee to perform any service authorized by the governing body.\n\nB. The mayor may appoint temporary employees as required for the proper administration of municipal affairs. The employee shall serve only until the next regular meeting of the governing body at which a quorum is present.

Lopez, 1970-NMSC-058, 81 N.M. 389, 467 P.2d 715.\n\nAuthority to discharge not superseded by city manager's authority.— There is nothing in 3-14-14A(2) NMSA 1978 to indicate that the mayor's and/or city council's authority to discharge and employ under Subsection D of this section is superseded by the city manager's authority to discharge persons in administrative service.Sanchez v. City of Belen, 1982-NMCA-070, 98 N.M. 57, 644 P.2d 1046, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794.\n\nVillage clerk-treasurer not subject to merit system.— A village clerk-treasurer was an appointed official under 3-12-4 NMSA 1978 to whom the village had no authority to apply its merit system ordinance adopted under 3-13-4 NMSA 1978. Construing the word \"employees\" in 3-13-4 NMSA 1978 as not including appointed officers conforms to common usage.Webb v. Village of Ruidoso Downs, 1994-NMCA-026, 117 N.M. 253, 871 P.2d 17, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 524, 873 P.2d 270.\n\nCourt personnel excluded from general merit system.— Personnel directly employed by the courts cannot constitutionally be included in a general merit system or ordinance.Mowrer v.
