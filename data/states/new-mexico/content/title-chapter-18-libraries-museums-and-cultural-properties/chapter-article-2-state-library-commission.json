      "text": "The interstate library compact is hereby enacted into law and is entered into on behalf of this state with any state bordering on New Mexico which legally joins therein in substantially the following form:\n\nINTERSTATE LIBRARY COMPACT\n\nThe contracting states agree that:\n\nARTICLE I - PURPOSE\n\nBecause the desire for the services provided by public libraries transcends governmental boundaries and can be provided most effectively by giving such services to communities of people regardless of jurisdictional lines, it is the policy of the states who are parties to this compact to cooperate and share their responsibilities in providing joint and cooperative library services in areas where the distribution of population makes the provision of library service on an interstate basis the most effective way to provide adequate and efficient services.\n\nARTICLE II - PROCEDURE\n\nThe appropriate officials and agencies of the party states or any of their political subdivisions may, on behalf of said states or political subdivisions, enter into agreements for the cooperative or joint conduct of library services when they shall find that the executions of agreements to that end as provided herein will facilitate library services.\n\nARTICLE III - CONTENT\n\nAny such agreement for the cooperative or joint establishment, operation or use of library services, facilities, personnel, equipment, materials or other items not excluded because of failure to enumerate shall, as among the parties of the agreement: (1) detail the specific nature of the services, facilities, properties or personnel to which it is applicable; (2) provide for the allocation of costs and other financial responsibilities; (3) specify the respective rights, duties, obligations and liabilities; (4) stipulate the terms and conditions for duration, renewal, termination, abrogation, disposal of joint or common property, if any, and all other matters which may be appropriate to the proper effectuation and performance of said agreement.\n\nARTICLE IV - CONFLICT OF LAWS\n\nNothing in this compact or in any agreement entered into hereunder shall be construed to supersede, alter or otherwise impair any obligation imposed on any public library by otherwise applicable laws.\n\nARTICLE V - ADMINISTRATOR\n\nEach state shall designate a compact administrator with whom copies of all agreements to which his state or any subdivision thereof is party shall be filed. The administrator shall have such powers as may be conferred upon him by the laws of his state and may consult and cooperate with the compact administrators of other party states and take such steps as may effectuate the purposes of this compact.\n\nARTICLE VI - EFFECTIVE DATE\n\nThis compact shall become operative immediately upon its enactment by any state or between it and any other contiguous state or states so enacting.\n\nARTICLE VII - RENUNCIATION\n\nThis compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each party state until six months after any such state has given notice of repeal by the legislature. Such withdrawal shall not be construed to relieve any party to an agreement authorized by Articles II and III of the compact from the obligation of that agreement prior to the end of its stipulated period of duration.\n\nARTICLE VIII - SEVERABILITY\n\nThe provisions of this compact shall be severable. It is intended that the provisions of this compact be reasonably and liberally construed.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 4-11-16, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 20, § 2.",
