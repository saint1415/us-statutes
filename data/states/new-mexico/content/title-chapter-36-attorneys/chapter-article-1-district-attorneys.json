Each district attorney shall:\n\n(1) prosecute and defend for the state in all courts of record of the counties of his district all cases, criminal and civil, in which the state or any county in his district may be a party or may be interested;\n\n(2) represent the county before the board of county commissioners of any county in his district in all matters before the board whenever requested to do so by the board, and he may appear before the board when sitting as a board of equalization without request;\n\n(3) advise all county and state officers whenever requested; and\n\n(4) represent any county in his district in all civil cases in which the county may be concerned in the supreme court or court of appeals, but not in suits brought in the name of the state.\n\nB. A district attorney may contract with an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo within the boundaries of the district attorney's judicial district for the purpose of authorizing the district attorney or his staff to:\n\n(1) serve as a tribal prosecutor; or\n\n(2) prosecute alleged violations of tribal codes by tribal members in tribal courts.\n\nHistory:Laws 1909, ch. 22, § 2; Code 1915, § 1859; C.S. 1929, § 39-108; 1941 Comp., § 17-111; 1953 Comp., § 17-1-11; Laws 1966, ch. 28, § 30; 2001, ch. 178, § 2.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The 1915 Code compilers deleted from the end of former subdivision 2 (now Paragraph A(2)) \"and he shall appeal from the decisions of such board to the territorial board of equalization whenever in his judgment the same should be done, and a right of appeal in such cases is hereby given.\" The state board of equalization, as provided for in the constitution, was in effect abolished by the amendment to art. VIII, § 5, of the constitution adopted in 1914. The provisions concerning appeals to the state board of equalization were repealed by Laws 1915, ch. 54, § 5. Provisions relating to county valuation protests boards and proceedings thereof are compiled as 7-38-25 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nCross references.— For prosecution of solicitation of claims by attorneys,see36-2-37 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties as member of commission to determine county boundary disputes,see4-35-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duty of attorney general to act when district attorney fails to act,see8-5-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties relating to removal of officers,see10-4-17 to 10-4-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor prosecutions for shortages in officer's accounts,see10-17-9 to 10-17-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties relating to minimum wage actions by employees of public contractors,see13-4-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties relating to fish and game laws,see17-2-27 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties relating to failure to record townsite patent,see19-4-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties relating to enforcement of law regarding burial of indigent persons,see24-13-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties as attorney for persons seeking reemployment after discharge from armed forces,see28-15-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties relating to grand juries,see31-6-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties as ex-officio children's court attorney,see32A-1-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor petitions under Children's Code generally,see32A-1-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties relating to interstate family support,see40-6A-308 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties as attorney for employment security commission,see51-1-40 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor enforcement of Retail Installment Sales Act,see56-1-10 and 56-1-11 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duty to enforce motion picture regulations,see57-5-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties relating to false advertising,see57-15-4 to 57-15-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor prosecution of violations of Dental Health Care Act,see61-5A-18 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor prosecution of violations of Motor Carrier Transportation Agent Law,see65-4-15 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties relating to representation of soil and water conservation districts,see73-20-41 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties relating to county board of horticultural commissioners,see76-3-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor prosecution of seed law violations,see76-10-21 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor prosecution of violations of Pecan Industry Law,see76-16-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, inserted the Subsection A designation, added Subsection B and redesignated former Subsections A to D as Paragraphs A(1) to (4).\n\nObligation of prosecutor.— The prosecutor is a public officer with duties quasi-judicial in nature. The prosecutor's obligation is not only to protect the public interest but also the rights of the accused. In the performance of the prosecutor's duties, the prosecutor must not only be disinterested and impartial, but must also appear to be so.State v. Hill, 1975-NMCA-093, 88 N.M. 216, 539 P.2d 236 (Ct. App. 1975).\n\nDiscretion to determine criminal charges.— The district attorney makes the determination whether to file criminal charges and which charges to file.State v. Session, 1978-NMCA-005, 91 N.M. 381, 574 P. 2d 600;State v. Estrada, 2001-NMCA-034, 130 N.M. 358, 24 P.3d 793, cert. denied, 130 N.M. 459, 26 P.3d 103.\n\nFamilial relationship between defendant and district attorney.— Where defendant claimed that the district attorney was a third cousin of the defendant and that in Navajo culture, defendant and the district attorney had a clan relationship that made the district attorney culturally the grandfather of defendant, and the district attorney swore in an affidavit that although the district attorney was one-half Navajo, the district attorney was unaware of any clan relationship with defendant, that the district attorney had never had personal or direct contact with defendant until after the prosecution of defendant's case had begun, and that the district attorney had only recently discovered that the district attorney's grandmother was the sister of defendant's great-grandfather, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the familial relationship between the district attorney and defendant was insufficient to create a personal bias that warranted disqualification.State v. Juan, 2010-NMSC-041, 148 N.M. 747, 242 P.3d 314.\n\nDisqualification of district attorney's office.— Where defendant's spouse wrote letters to the disciplinary board and to the prosecutor's supervisor and the prosecutor had initiated a federal investigation into defendant's spouse for stalking, the actions of defendant's spouse and the prosecutor did not create a disqualifying interest warranting the recusal of the prosecutor and the district attorney's office.State v. Trujillo, 2012-NMCA-112, 289 P.3d 238, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-011.\n\nThreats against a prosecutor.— A defendant does not create a disqualifying interest and cannot choose his or her prosecutor for an underlying offense by the use of threats against prosecutors. An entire district attorney's office is not subject to disqualification unless an individual prosecutor is disqualified and there is a danger that the prosecutor's bias or disqualifying interest will taint the remaining attorneys in the office or give the appearance of impropriety to continued prosecution by other attorneys.State v. Robinson, 2008-NMCA-036, 143 N.M. 646, 179 P.3d 1254, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-002, 143 N.M. 666, 180 P.3d 673.\n\nHistorical law officer of the territory.— Prior to the adoption of the constitution the district attorney was by statute the law officer of the territory, and was required to represent the territory, within his district, in all cases, civil and criminal, and to give advice, when requested, to territorial officials.State ex rel. Ward v. Romero, 1912-NMSC-011, 17 N.M. 88, 125 P. 617.\n\nUnder the constitution, the district attorney is a part of the judicial system of the state,and is a quasi-judicial officer.State ex rel. Ward v. Romero, 1912-NMSC-011, 17 N.M. 88, 125 P. 617.\n\nDistrict officer construed.— The words \"district officer\" used in N.M. Const., art. XX, § 3, refer to the district attorney and district judge, but the words were used to designate the geographical limits within which such officer performed the duties of his office, and did not refer to the nature and grade of the office.State ex rel. Ward v. Romero, 1912-NMSC-011, 17 N.M. 88, 125 P. 617.\n\nDistrict attorney has no powers outside his district, nor does he have any common-law powers.State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Reese, 1967-NMSC-172, 78 N.M. 241, 430 P.2d 399.\n\nDistrict attorney or attorney general to represent state in criminal proceedings.— Although Subsection A does not require the district attorney to appear in a nonrecord court such as the metropolitan court, 36-1-19 NMSA 1978 prohibits anyone other than the attorney general's office and district attorney's office from representing the state in a criminal proceeding, except on order of the court and with the consent of those offices.State v. Baca, 1984-NMCA-096, 101 N.M. 716, 688 P.2d 34.\n\nInstitution of probation revocation proceedings.— Although the specific procedural authority of 40A-29-20, 1953 Comp., had been repealed, the district attorney, as the chief law officer of his district, had authority to institute probation revocation proceedings.State v. Paul, 1971-NMCA-107, 82 N.M. 791, 487 P.2d 493.\n\nAppearance on appeal in criminal cases.— District attorney has authority to take an appeal, but it is the prerogative and duty of attorney general to brief the case and to present it in supreme court, and a district attorney may appear on appeal in a criminal case only by permission of the attorney general and in association with him.State v. Aragon, 1950-NMSC-053, 55 N.M. 421, 234 P.2d 356,rev'd on other grounds, 1951-NMSC-052, 55 N.M. 423, 234 P.2d 358.\n\nAuthority of district attorney to bind state agency.— When representing the state in a prosecution for driving under the influence, a district attorney had the authority to bind the motor vehicle division to the judgment and sentence which, pursuant to a plea bargain, expressly provided that the conviction was to be treated as a first conviction.Collyer v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't Motor Vehicle Div., 1996-NMCA-029, 121 N.M. 477, 913 P.2d 665.\n\nOffice's immunity in defamation suit.— In a defamation suit arising out of a report prepared by an assistant district attorney at the request of the district attorney, the trial court's ruling of absolute immunity was based upon the concepts of judicial immunity, because the office of district attorney is a quasi-judicial office, as well as executive immunity, because that office has duties which cannot be properly classified as quasi-judicial.Candelaria v. Robinson, 1980-NMCA-003, 93 N.M. 786, 606 P.2d 196.\n\nNo fee for representation of the county.— All services rendered to boards of county commissioners by district attorneys are official duties. There are no legal services that can be rendered by a district attorney for a board of county commissioners for which the district attorney may exact extra compensation.Hanagan v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1958-NMSC-053, 64 N.M. 103, 325 P.2d 282.\n\nIf criminal complaint is filed by sheriff without consent of the district attorney, the latter may at any time step in and take charge of the caseand the prosecution on behalf of the state, since he is the chief law enforcement officer and the state's prosecutor in his district. 1939 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 39-3257.\n\nDistrict attorney may initiate a foreclosure action in the name of the county treasurerinterested in the particular assessment. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-77.\n\nDistrict attorneys are not required to defend sheriffs in civil suits.Their duties are limited solely to representing the interests of the state in criminal and civil actions. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-98.\n\nThe district attorney is not obligated to represent a county sheriff in a civil suit. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-47.\n\nDistrict attorney to \"represent the county\" and \"advise county officials.\"These terms are used in the generally accepted sense, namely, the district attorney is to serve as attorney for the county in all matters when called upon to so act. The legislature intended to make the district attorney the attorney for the counties of his district. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6565.\n\nDistrict attorney to represent the county.— Whenever the county commissioners request representation in any matter before them, it is the duty of the district attorney to act for such county. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6565.\n\nDuty to advise state officers found in this section is limitedto those matters relating to and pending in the judicial district in which the district attorney is located - not to matters of statewide application. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-61.\n\nDuty to advise limited.— While a district attorney is to advise state officers within his district when requested, this means \"advise these officers on matters relating to the judicial district in which he is located.\" 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-61.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"The Use of an Information Following the Return of a Grand Jury No Bill: State v. Joe Nestor Chavez,\"see10 N.M.L. Rev. 217 (1979-80).\n\nAm.

Except as provided in Subsections B and C of this section, no one shall represent the state or any county thereof in any matter in which the state or county is interested except the attorney general, his legally appointed and qualified assistants or the district attorney or his legally appointed and qualified assistants and such associate counsel as may appear on order of the court, with the consent of the attorney general or district attorney.\n\nB. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a board of county commissioners may contract with private counsel for legal assistance to or representation of the county in any civil matter in which the county is interested. Such private counsel shall have the same powers of compromise, satisfaction or release in civil proceedings as are held by district attorneys pursuant to Section 36-1-22 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. The private legal assistance permitted pursuant to Subsection B of this section shall not extend to the prosecution of any criminal action without the permission of the district attorney for that county, provided that such permission shall not be required for the prosecution of any violation of a county ordinance.\n\nHistory:Laws 1909, ch. 22, § 15; Code 1915, § 1860; C.S. 1929, § 39-109; Laws 1933, ch. 21, § 7; 1941 Comp., § 17-112; 1953 Comp., § 17-1-12; Laws 1977, ch. 318, § 1; 1985, ch. 147, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For employment of special legal assistance by the attorney general,see8-5-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nAttorney general or district attorney must represent state or county.— The attorney general's office or the district attorney's office must represent the state, or a county, in any matter in which the latter is interested.State v. Davidson, 1929-NMSC-016, 33 N.M. 664, 275 P. 373 (decided prior to 1977 amendment).\n\nRepresentation of municipality.— This statute does not apply to the representation of a municipality by a city attorney in a prosecution to enforce a municipal ordinance.City of Roswell v. Smith, 2006-NMCA-040, 139 N.M. 381, 133 P.3d 271, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-004, 139 N.M. 429, 134 P.3d 120.\n\nBut Subsection A only applicable in suits in court.— It is only in suits in court by the state or a county, and where special counsel seek to represent the state or a county, that Subsection A has any application.State v. Davidson, 1929-NMSC-016, 33 N.M. 664, 275 P. 373 (decided prior to 1933 amendment).\n\nImproper representation of state denies jurisdiction of court.— Where there was no explicit approval by order of court authorizing a private counsel to prosecute for the district attorney, the metropolitan court lacked criminal jurisdiction to proceed in an assault and battery proceeding on the criminal docket.State v. Baca, 1984-NMCA-096, 101 N.M. 716, 688 P.2d 34.\n\nPurpose of this section and 36-1-4 NMSA 1978is to prevent an attorney engaged in the performance of public duties from being influenced or appearing to be influenced by personal or private interests. The potential for conflict between public and private interests exists whether the legal services rendered consist of court appearances or other legal services. 1977 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 77-07.\n\nOfficer may not prosecute case in district court after appeal.— A peace officer who has prosecuted a criminal case in magistrate or municipal court may not continue to prosecute the case in district court after an appeal of the magistrate or municipal court judgment has been filed in district court. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-27.\n\nResponsibility for attorney's fees.— In a lawsuit between a county commission and other elected county officials concerning employment terms and conditions, each party is responsible for its own attorney's fees. The county is responsible for legal fees of its elected officials and employees only to the extent required by statute. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen.

Otero, 1934-NMSC-008, 38 N.M. 164, 29 P.2d 341.\n\nPower to settle cases.— A settlement entered into by the attorney general, with no evidence of bad motives, is not unconstitutional under N.M. Const., art. IV, § 32 and \"in the absence of explicit legislative expression to the contrary, the attorney general possesses entire dominion over every suit instituted by him in his official capacity whether there is a relator or not. As an incident of such control, the attorney general has power to dismiss or to discontinue suits brought by him either with or without a stipulation by the other party, and to make any dispositions of such suits that he deems best for the interest of the state.\"Lyle v.

Luna, 1959-NMSC-042, 65 N.M. 429, 338 P.2d 1060.\n\nWhen representing the state in a prosecution for driving under the influence, a district attorney had the authority to bind the motor vehicle division to the judgment and sentence which, pursuant to a plea bargain, expressly provided that the conviction was to be treated as a first conviction.Collyer v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't Motor Vehicle Div., 1996-NMCA-029, 121 N.M. 477, 913 P.2d 665.\n\nJudicial review.— Absent a showing of fraud or misdealing, it is not for the courts to second-guess the attorney general in the exercise of his authority in compromising a matter.State ex rel. Property Appraisal Dep't v. Sierra Life Ins. Co., 1977-NMSC-023, 90 N.M. 268, 562 P.2d 829.\n\nCompromise and settlement of tax suits.— The district attorney has full authority to compromise and settle any action instituted in behalf of the state ex rel. its state tax commission (now property tax division of taxation and revenue department) and the county treasurer, for the collection of delinquent personal property taxes. This authority is, of course, subject to the duty of the attorney general's office to act, pursuant to 8-5-2 NMSA 1978, when in the judgment of the attorney general the interest of the state requires such action, and to the authority of the attorney general's office to act pursuant to this section, empowering the attorney general to compromise and settle civil proceedings, in the event of any conflict between the state tax commission (now property tax division of taxation and revenue department) and the district attorney as to the propriety of a particular proposed settlement in a case within the authority of the commission to act. 1958 Op.

Any person so appointed shall have authority to act only in the specific case or matter for which the appointment was made. An appointment and oath shall be required of special assistant district attorneys in substantially the same form as that required for assistant district attorneys in Section 36-1-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 36-1-23.1, enacted by Laws 1984, ch. 109, § 2.\n\nSubstantial compliance sufficient.— Substantial compliance with this section, not strict compliance, is all that is required, and there was substantial compliance in this case since the appointment of a district attorney as a special prosecutor was placed in writing and filed under a miscellaneous file number, he was administered the oath, and he did not act outside the bounds of his authority.State v. Cherryhomes, 1996-NMSC-072, 122 N.M. 687, 930 P.2d 1139.\n\nWhere local district attorney available.— Attorney who was part of the Medicaid Providers Fraud Control Unit and was appointed a special assistant district attorney could not prosecute a criminal sexual penetration case for a local district attorney, where the state conceded there was no reason why the district attorney could not have prosecuted the case.State v. Hollenbeck, 1991-NMCA-060, 112 N.M. 275, 814 P.2d 143.\n\nDelegation of authority to assistant.— This section did not preclude a district attorney appointed as a special prosecutor from delegating responsibilities associated with his appointment to an assistant district attorney acting under his supervision; therefore, the assistant had the authority of a special prosecutor, and a separate appointment was not required.State v. Cherryhomes, 1996-NMSC-072, 122 N.M. 687, 930 P.2d 1139.\n\nPower and authority of a special prosecutor.— A properly appointed special prosecutor is given all the authority and duties of the appointing district attorney to prosecute the case for which that special prosecutor was appointed, including the authority to name another special prosecutor if unable to proceed for an ethical reason or other good cause.State v. Surratt, 2016-NMSC-004,rev'g2015-NMCA-039, 346 P.3d 419.\n\nWhere defendant was charged with criminal sexual penetration of a minor, his claim, that the district attorney serving as special prosecutor at his second trial lacked the authority to prosecute the case because his appointment by the first special prosecutor was without legal effect, was properly denied by the district court. The lawful appointment of the first special prosecutor vested her with all the powers and duties of the original district attorney to investigate and prosecute the case, including the authority to appoint another special prosecutor pursuant to 36-1-23.1 NMSA 1978.State v. Surratt, 2016-NMSC-004,rev'g2015-NMCA-039, 346 P.3d 419.\n\nSpecial prosecutor vested with limited authority.— A special prosecutor is vested with limited authority to act only in the specific case or matter for which the appointment was made, and does not assume the authority with which the appointing district attorney was vested by virtue of having been elected to the office; a special prosecutor appointed to prosecute a criminal case, therefore, does not have the authority to appoint another special prosecutor.State v. Surratt, 2015-NMCA-039, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-002.\n\nWhere defendant's motion for re-trial was granted after being convicted in his first trial, which was prosecuted by a special prosecutor appointed by the district attorney of the judicial district in which the case originated, and where defendant's second trial was prosecuted by a second special prosecutor appointed by the first special prosecutor, the first special prosecutor lacked lawful authority to appoint a second prosecutor, and the second special prosecutor was without lawful authority to prosecute the case against defendant, and without lawful authority to prosecute the case, the district court lacked jurisdiction over defendant's re-trial.State v. Surratt, 2015-NMCA-039, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-002.\n\nA legislator's appointment as a special assistant district attorney does not violate the separation of powers doctrine in Article III, Section 1 of the New Mexico Constitution.— The New Mexico Constitution prohibits a person charged with the exercise of the powers of one branch of government from exercising the powers of the other branches of government, prohibits service as a legislator by any person who, at the time of qualifying, holds any office of trust or profit with the state, county or national governments, and prohibits a legislator from being appointed to a civil office in the state during the legislator's term of office. A district attorney occupies an office of trust, is a quasi-judicial officer, and exercises core executive functions; as a result, a district attorney is constitutionally ineligible to serve as a member of the legislative branch. A private attorney appointed as a special assistant district attorney, however, is neither a public officer nor a public employee of the appointing district attorney and exercises the power and authority of the district attorney only in the specific case or matter for which they are appointed, and therefore a legislator's appointment to such a role does not unduly encroach upon or interfere with the authority of the executive or judicial branches. A private attorney's isolated exercise of district attorney authority while serving as a special assistant district attorney and a legislator does not violate the separation of powers doctrine of Article III, Section 1 of the New Mexico Constitution. 2024 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 24-04.",
