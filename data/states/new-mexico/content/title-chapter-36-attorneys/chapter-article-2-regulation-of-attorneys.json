      "text": "The supreme court of the state of New Mexico shall, by rules promulgated from time to time, define and regulate the practice of law within the state of New Mexico. The supreme court shall cause such rules to be printed and distributed to all members of the bar, to applicants for admission and to all courts within the state of New Mexico and the same shall not become effective until thirty (30) days after the same shall have been made ready for distribution and so distributed.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 18-101, enacted by Laws 1941, ch. 96, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 18-1-1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For right of attorney to portion of land as fee in actions quieting title,see42-6-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor limitation of fees in proceedings before employment security commission,see51-1-37 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor limitation on fees in workmen's compensation cases,see52-1-54 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor incorporation by attorneys,see53-6-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor provisions of Rules Governing Admission to the Bar,seeRule 15-101 NMRA et seq.\n\nFor provisions of Rules of Professional Conduct,seeRule 16-101 NMRA et seq.\n\nFor provisions of Rules Governing Discipline,seeRule 17-101 NMRA et seq.\n\nAuthority of supreme court.— The supreme court's constitutional power of superintending control encompasses the court's authority and duty to prescribe the qualifications for admission to the bar, to prescribe standards of conduct for lawyers, to determine what constitutes grounds for the discipline of lawyers and to discipline, for cause, any person admitted to practice law in New Mexico. Any legislative attempt to limit what conduct the court may consider as grounds for imposing attorney discipline would be an unconstitutional infringement on the court's authority to regulate the practice of law.In re Treinen, 2006-NMSC-013, 139 N.M. 318, 131 P.3d 1282.\n\nPrime purpose of licensing attorneysand in making them the exclusive practitioners in their field is to protect the public from the evils occasioned by unqualified persons performing legal services.State Bar v. Guardian Abstract & Title Co., 1978-NMSC-016, 91 N.M. 434, 575 P.2d 943.\n\nPurpose of attorney regulation.— The close regulation of those who practice law is to protect the unwary and the uninformed from injury at the hands of persons unskilled or unlearned in the law.State Bar v. Guardian Abstract & Title Co., 1978-NMSC-016, 91 N.M. 434, 575 P.2d 943.\n\nPower of legislature to regulate admission to bar.— The process of admitting to the bar comprehends fixing standards as to mental and scholastic qualifications and determining whether the applicant meets such requirements. The exercise thereof is a judicial function, inherent in the courts. The legislature may enact valid laws in aid of such functions and may, if in furtherance thereof, fix minimum requirements, but in no event, maximum requirements; and may not require the courts to admit on standards other than as accepted or established by the courts. Any legislation which attempts to do so is an invasion of the judicial power and violative of the constitutional provisions establishing the separate branches of government and prohibiting the legislature from invading the judiciary.In re Sedillo, 1959-NMSC-095, 66 N.M. 267, 347 P.2d 162.\n\nAuthority to discipline lawyers.— The New Mexico state racing commission does not have the authority to prohibit an attorney from representing a client before the commission in adjudicatory proceedings or public hearings on the basis of alleged misconduct: The supreme court has the exclusive authority to discipline lawyers. 1987 Op.

Physicians shall refrain from giving legal advice.\n\n\"2. Physicians shall refrain from interfering with established lawyer-client relationships.\n\n\"ATTORNEYS AND HEALTH CARE\n\n\"1. Attorneys shall refrain from giving medical advice.\n\n\"2. Attorneys shall refrain from interfering with established physician-patient relationships.\n\n\"AN ATTORNEY'S RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n\"An attorney's responsibility is always first to his client. However, in his relationships with physicians, an attorney has the following responsibilities:\n\n\"1.Testimony.An attorney must keep the physician fully informed as to the status of the litigation and in particular inform him sufficiently in advance of:\n\n\"a) trial settings;\n\n\"b) vacated settings;\n\n\"c) pre-trial settlements.\n\n\"2.Fees.The services of a physician in a legal matter involve the consumption of the physician's time and the utilization of his facilities and his expertise over and above that required in merely treating his patient. As a result, the attorney shall make proper arrangements with all involved physicians beforehand for payment for the physician's services either directly by his client or by the attorney himself through the advancement of costs.\n\n\"An attorney is not expected to advance costs for physician's services involving treatment.\n\n\"An attorney who requests information from a physician solely to advance his medical knowledge is responsible personally for prompt payment of those services.\n\n\"3.Background.An attorney must familiarize himself with the medical issues involved in his case from available medical literature in order that he may have some initial understanding of the problem and so that he might be able to specify the information requested from the physician and understand the physician and understand the physician's explanation and report.\n\n\"A PHYSICIAN'S RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n\"A physician's primaryresponsibility is always the health of his patient. However, a physician having a patient involved in the legal process has the following responsibilities:\n\n\"1.Records.Given a valid authorization, the physician should promptly transfer information from his records to the requesting attorney.\n\n\"2.Reports.Given a valid authorization, reports covering a summation of medical facts and opinions concerning their significance shall be furnished upon request by the treating physician or the physician specifically engaged to do such work insofar as their expertise permits. The attorney should specify the items he wishes covered in that report.\n\n\"3.Conferences.Given a valid authorization, attorneys may confer with physicians either to:\n\n\"a) gain medical information on a topic of the attorney's interest, or\n\n\"b) discuss medical aspects of the case of a particular client with the treating physician or with one engaged to render such opinions. This may include a discussion of testimony that may be elicited at trial.\n\n\"4.Testimony.Physicians may be required to testify either in court or by deposition. Cooperation between both attorneys and physicians should obviate the necessity for subpoenas.\n\n\"A physician should familiarize himself with the basic requirements of court procedure.\n\n\"A physician is not an advocate and should leave the representation of his patient and advancement of the patient's interests to the patient's attorney.\n\n\"5.Fees.Physicians may use the expenditure of their time, office facilities, and funds as a basis for arriving at a reasonable fee for services rendered pursuant to these principles. If an attorney fails to give timely notification of a change in the scheduled time for the physician's services, which makes the physician unavailable for other remunerative work, the physician may charge for the time set aside.\"\n\nAm.

John Williams & Assocs., 1979-NMSC-002, 92 N.M. 437, 589 P.2d 1028.\n\nClient accepting benefits of unauthorized settlement is bound.— Where an attorney has not been authorized to settle a case but the client accepts the benefits of the settlement before attempting to treat the settlement as unauthorized and unenforceable, the client is bound by his attorney's settlement.Augustus v. John Williams & Assocs., 1979-NMSC-002, 92 N.M. 437, 589 P.2d 1028.\n\nAuthority to settle.— An attorney may not settle a client's claim without specific authorization from the client. If there is an issue as to whether there was authorization, the party seeking enforcement of the alleged settlement agreement has the burden of establishing authorization. If it is undisputed that client authorization existed, the burden of persuasion is on the party seeking to escape from the enforceability of an authorized settlement agreement.Gomez v. Jones-Wilson, 2013-NMCA-007, 294 P.3d 1269.\n\nApparent authority to settle.— It is the client's conduct, not the attorney's conduct, that gives rise to apparent authority. The law requires some affirmative indication from the client that the client's attorney has the appropriate authority to settle before a settlement agreement is enforced.Gomez v. Jones-Wilson, 2013-NMCA-007, 294 P.3d 1269.\n\nNo apparent authority to settle.— Where plaintiff was injured due to the negligence of the driver of a truck that the driver's employer had leased from a leasing agency; plaintiff's attorney began settlement negotiations with the leasing agency; the leasing agency's attorney subsequently made a written settlement offer for both the leasing agency and the driver; after the leasing agency's attorney's offer expired, the attorneys had a telephone conversion; the leasing agency's attorney claimed that plaintiff's attorney orally agreed to settle with both the leasing agency and the driver; plaintiff's attorney claimed that plaintiff's attorney orally agreed only to settle with the leasing agency; plaintiff asserted that plaintiff had agreed to settle only with the leasing agency and never authorized plaintiff's attorney to settle with the driver; plaintiff's assertion was undisputed; and there was no evidence of any conduct or communication by plaintiff suggesting that plaintiff clothed plaintiff's attorney with apparent authority to settle with the driver, the alleged settlement agreement with the driver was unenforceable because plaintiff's attorney lacked express authority to settle with the driver and the driver failed to present evidence that plaintiff, rather than plaintiff's attorney, acted in a way that created the appearance that plaintiff's attorney had authority to settle with the driver.Gomez v. Jones-Wilson, 2013-NMCA-007, 294 P.3d 1269.\n\nScope of authority.— Where defendant did not personally sign the answer in the prior suit, in which appears the admission of the debt now sued upon, but in her answer in the present suit she admits her deceased husband signed the answer in the prior suit as attorney for her and himself, and no question has been raised as to his authority to sign the answer as her attorney or to make the admission on her behalf, then his signature on her behalf to the answer in the prior suit had the same effect as if she had personally signed.Smith v.

Norvell v. Credit Bureau of Albuquerque, Inc., 1973-NMSC-087, 85 N.M. 521, 514 P.2d 40.\n\nMeaning of \"practice of law\".— It is the character of the services rendered and not the denomination of the tribunal before whom they are rendered which controls in determining whether such services constitute the practice of law. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-200.\n\nThe practice of law, as generally understood, is the doing or performing of services in a court of justice, in any matter pending therein, throughout its various stages, and in conformity with the adopted rules or procedure, but, is not confined to performing services in an action or proceeding pending in courts of justice, and, in a larger sense, it includes legal advice and counsel, and the preparation of legal instruments and contracts by which legal rights are secured, although such matter may or may not be pending in a court. To \"practice law\" is to carry on the business of an attorney at law; to do or practice that which an attorney or counselor at law is authorized to do and practice; to exercise the calling or profession of the law, usually for the purpose of gaining a livelihood, or at least for gain; to make it one's business to act for, and by the warrant of, others in legal formalities, negotiations, or proceedings. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-173.\n\nIf a layman or an attorney appears in a representative capacity as an advocate in hearings before any commissioner, hearing officer, referee, board, body, committee or commission of the state of New Mexico which considers legal questions, applies legal principles and weighs facts under legal rules, and, in that representative capacity, files pleadings, qualifies, examines and cross-examines witnesses, proves and introduces exhibits into evidence or performs any of the other duties normally associated with an attorney requiring specialized training and skill, such layman or attorney is practicing law within the meaning of the term as it is used in this section. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen.
