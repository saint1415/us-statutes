Furthermore, in New Mexico there exists an ameliorative feature which insures that if defendants tried before a nonattorney municipal judge want to have an attorney judge, then after trial, or upon a nolo contendere or a guilty plea, they could seek an immediate trial de novo in district court before an attorney judge.Tsiosdia v.
