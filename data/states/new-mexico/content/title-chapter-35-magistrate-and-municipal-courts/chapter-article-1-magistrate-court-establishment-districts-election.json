Const., art VI, § 26 and this section to \"limited\" jurisdiction indicates that a magistrate is without authority to take action unless the authority has been affirmatively granted, and neither provision authorizes a magistrate to set aside its judgment in a criminal case.State v.

A magistrate has continuing control over a criminal judgment only until such time as the aggrieved party's opportunity to file an appeal expires. The time limitation for filing the appeal is 15 days.State v. Ramirez, 1981-NMSC-125, 97 N.M. 125, 637 P.2d 556.\n\nLimited control over civil judgment.— A magistrate's continuing control over civil judgments expires 15 days after entry of judgment.State v.
