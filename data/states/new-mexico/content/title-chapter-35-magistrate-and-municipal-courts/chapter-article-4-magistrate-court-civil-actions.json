Exemptions of personal property provided in Sections 24-5-1 through 24-5-13 New Mexico Statutes Annotated, 1953 Compilation, apply to all executions in civil actions in the magistrate court, and to attachment, garnishment, replevin and forcible entry or detainer. The person entitled to the exemption or his agent or attorney shall claim the exemption by filing as a part of the action pending in the magistrate court a list of the particular property claimed to be exempt and a statement of the grounds for the exemption. The list may be filed at any time before sale of the property or before money garnished is paid to the plaintiff.\n\nB. Upon the filing of a list of claimed exemptions, the magistrate shall notify the plaintiff in the action that claim of exemption has been made for the property specified in the list, and notify both parties of a time set for hearing on the claim of exemption. At the time set for hearing, the magistrate shall receive evidence, determine the issues and enter judgment on the claim of exemption.\n\nC. If judgment on the claim of exemption is rendered after expiration of the time for appeal on the main issue in the action, either party aggrieved by the judgment on the claim of exemption may appeal from that judgment to the district court in the same manner as other appeals from final judgments of the magistrate court are taken. If judgment on the claim of exemption is rendered before judgment on the main issue in the cause, the judgment on the claim of exemption shall be deemed interlocutory and included within any appeal taken on the main issue in the action.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 36-4-12, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 66.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Sections 24-5-1 to 24-5-8, 1953 Comp., are presently compiled as 42-10-1 to 42-10-7 NMSA 1978.
