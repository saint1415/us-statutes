      "text": "Any party aggrieved by any judgment rendered or final order issued by the magistrate court in any civil action or special statutory proceeding, or the defendant aggrieved by any judgment rendered or final order issued by the magistrate court in any criminal action, may appeal to the district court within fifteen days after judgment is rendered or the final order is issued in the magistrate court.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 36-15-1, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 148; 1975, ch. 242, § 9.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 171, repealed former 36-15-1 to 36-15-4, 1953 Comp., relating to forfeiture of appearance bonds, summons, service and appeal, effective January 1, 1969.\n\nCross references.— For constitutional authority to appeal,seeN.M. Const., art. VI, § 27.\n\nFor procedures governing appeals to the district court from magistrate courts in trial de novo cases,seeRule 1-072 NMRA.\n\nFor appeal from magistrate court,seeRule 2-705 NMRA.\n\nOrder of dismissal is a final appealable order.— Where, after a hearing pursuant to a \"Notice of Probable Cause/Bench Trial\", the magistrate court entered an order which dismissed the action due to no probable clause, the order was a final appealable order.State v. Montoya, 2008-NMSC-043, 144 N.M. 458, 188 P.3d 1209.\n\nEvidentiary hearing to determine jurisdiction.— Where the defendant pled no contest in magistrate court and appealed the magistrate court sentence to district court, the district court did not err when it conducted an evidentiary hearing concerning the defendant's plea.State v. Gallegos, 2007-NMCA-112, 142 N.M. 447, 166 P.3d 1101, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-006, 142 N.M. 15, 162 P.3d 170.\n\nAppeal matter of right.— Appeal from justices' (now magistrates') court to district court was a matter of right.Lea County State Bank v. McCaskey Register Co., 1935-NMSC-069, 39 N.M. 454, 49 P.2d 577 (decided under prior law).\n\nTime for appeal is when order is filed.— The term \"entry\" as used in Subsection A of Rule 2-705 NMRA and the terms \"rendered\" and \"issued\" in Section 35-13-1 NMSA 1978 are synonymous with the time a judgment or decision is \"filed\" with the court clerk's office. Thus, the time for an appeal begins to run when the order is filed.Trujillo v. Serrano, 1994-NMSC-024, 117 N.M. 273, 871 P.2d 369.\n\nLate filing of appeal.— Because timely filing of an appeal is a mandatory precondition rather than an absolute jurisdictional requirement, a trial court may, under unusual circumstances, use its discretion and entertain an appeal even though it is not timely filed. The decision to dismiss an appeal is extreme and must be determined on a case-by-case basis.Trujillo v. Serrano, 1994-NMSC-024, 117 N.M. 273, 871 P.2d 369.\n\nCourt error may excuse late appeal.— One unusual circumstance which would warrant permitting an untimely appeal is if the delay is a result of judicial error. To deny a party the constitutional right to an appeal because of a mistake on the part of the court runs against the most basic precepts of justice and fairness.Trujillo v. Serrano, 1994-NMSC-024, 117 N.M. 273, 871 P.2d 369.\n\nAppeal by state.— Pursuant to N.M. Const., art. VI, § 27, the state is permitted to appeal to the district court from a final judgment or decision rendered by the magistrate court. This section does not preclude such an appeal by the state. State v. Barber, 1989-NMCA-058, 108 N.M. 709, 778 P.2d 456, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 713, 778 P.2d 911.\n\nThis section does not give the state the right to appeal a magistrate court's suppression order, because such an order is not a final judgment or order.State v. Heinsen, 2005-NMSC-035, 138 N.M. 441, 121 P.3d 1040.\n\nEffect on appeal of act or omission by magistrate.— After a party had done all that he reasonably could do and that the law required to perfect his appeal, it could not be defeated by any omission or act on part of justice of the peace (now magistrate) respecting appeal bond.State ex rel. Heron v. District Court of First Judicial Dist., 1942-NMSC-035, 46 N.M. 290, 128 P.2d 451 (decided under former law).\n\nScope of appeal from final order.— All appeals from a final order issued by the magistrate court are on the merits by trial de novo except as otherwise provided by law.State v. Heinsen, 2005-NMSC-035, 138 N.M. 441, 121 P.3d 1040.\n\nOmission by magistrate fatal to appeal.— Failure by plaintiff to make certain magistrate filed the transcript to the district court within statutory time period constituted a failure to prosecute diligently his appeal, warranting dismissal of appeal.Stripling v. PMC Realtors, Inc., 1971-NMSC-096, 83 N.M. 170, 489 P.2d 883.\n\nOmission not fatal.— The district court acquires jurisdiction of inferior court cases through notice of appeal, and the court is not divested of jurisdiction by the failure of the magistrate to submit a transcript of proceedings.State v. McKee, 1974-NMCA-103, 86 N.M. 733, 527 P.2d 496, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 730, 527 P.2d 493.\n\nWhen case beyond control of magistrate.— When appellant had done all that was required of him in perfecting an appeal, the case was beyond the control of the justice (now magistrate).Lea County State Bank v. McCaskey Register Co., 1935-NMSC-069, 39 N.M. 454, 49 P.2d 577 (decided under former law).\n\nEffect on default judgment.— One could appeal from a default judgment rendered and entered against him by a justice of the peace (now magistrate).State ex rel. Heron v. District Court of First Judicial Dist., 1942-NMSC-035, 46 N.M. 290, 128 P.2d 451, writ of prohibition denied, 1942-NMSC-036, 46 N.M. 296, 128 P.2d 454;M.J. Faggard & Co. v. Cunningham, 1914-NMSC-008, 18 N.M. 510, 138 P. 264 (decided under former law).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 47 Am. Jur. 2d Justices of the Peace § 82.\n\nPlea of guilty in justice of the peace or similar inferior court as precluding appeal, 42 A.L.R.2d 995.\n\n24 C.J.S. Criminal Law §§ 1668 to 1674; 51 C.J.S.

      "text": "A. Appeals from the magistrate courts shall be tried de novo in the district court.\n\nB. The district court docket fee in any criminal appeal is thirty-five dollars ($35.00), ten dollars ($10.00) of which shall be deposited in the court automation fund.\n\nC. If the judgment of the magistrate court in a criminal action is affirmed or rendered against the appellant on appeal or if the appellant fails to appear at the time fixed for hearing in the district court, the district court shall enter judgment imposing the same, a greater or a lesser penalty as that imposed in the magistrate court in the action.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 36-15-3, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 242, § 10; 1981, ch. 271, § 1; 1987, ch. 123, § 2; 1996, ch. 41, § 6.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 171, repealed former 36-15-3, 1953 Comp., relating to forfeiture of appearance bonds, summons, service and appeal, and Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 150, enacted a new 36-15-3, 1953 Comp., relating to appeals from magistrate to district courts. Laws 1975, ch. 242, § 10, repealed 36-15-3, 1953 Comp., relating to appeals from magistrate to district courts, and enacted a new section.\n\nCross references.— For the court automation fund,see34-9-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor trial de novo on appeal to district court,see39-3-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor appeal from magistrate to district court,seeRule 2-705 NMRA.\n\nThe 1996 amendment,effective May 15, 1996, substituted \"thirty-five dollars ($35.00), ten dollars ($10.00) of which shall be deposited in the court automation fund\" for \"twenty-five dollars ($25.00)\" at the end of Subsection B.\n\nThe 1987 amendment,effective June 19, 1987, substituted \"twenty-five dollars ($25.00)\" for \"two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50)\" in Subsection B.\n\nSome of the annotations listed below were decided under former law.\n\nDistrict court required to impose sentence.— When a defendant is convicted in a trial de novo on appeal from magistrate court, the district court is required to impose a sentence prior to remanding the case to the magistrate court for enforcement of the district court's judgment.State v. Montoya, 2005-NMCA-005, 136 N.M. 674, 104 P.3d 540, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-011, 138 N.M. 587, 124 P.3d 565.\n\nOrder of remand not final.— When the district court enters an order of remand to the magistrate court that does not resolve the issue of sentencing, the order is not final and appealable.State v. Montoya, 2005-NMCA-005, 136 N.M. 674, 104 P.3d 540, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-011, 138 N.M. 587, 124 P.3d 565.\n\nJurisdiction of district court.— On appeals from a magistrate court, the district court becomes a court of limited jurisdiction for the purpose of the appeal and the trial de novo.State v. Lynch, 1971-NMCA-049, 82 N.M. 532, 484 P.2d 374.\n\nDiscussion of right to jury trial for petty offenses.— A defendant is entitled to a jury trial for multiple petty offenses arising out of the same act, transaction or occurrence only if he is actually threatened at the commencement of trial with an aggregate potential penalty of greater than six months imprisonment.Haar v. Hanrahan, 708 F.2d 1547 (10th Cir. 1983).\n\nCase dismissed when no jurisdiction.— Where case was begun in justice court (now magistrate court) and appealed to district court, if justice (now magistrate) had no jurisdiction, there was nothing to try de novo, and the case, on proper motion, would be dismissed.Geren v. Lawson, 1919-NMSC-048, 25 N.M. 415, 184 P. 216.\n\nIf the magistrate court lacks jurisdiction, the district court suffers the same lack of jurisdiction.State v. Lynch, 1971-NMCA-049, 82 N.M. 532, 484 P.2d 374.\n\nDismissal since complaint defective.— The district court could not assume a more enlarged jurisdiction on appeal than was conferred on the justice (now magistrate). Where there was nothing in complaint for assault and battery to show in what county the offense took place, the cause would be dismissed.Territory v. Valencia, 1881-NMSC-008, 2 N.M. 108.\n\nTrial to be de novo.— Where appellant interposed a plea to the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace (now magistrate), which was overruled, and he declined to plead further, and judgment was rendered against him, and on appeal to the district court appellant conceded the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace (now magistrate), but appellee's motion for affirmance for that reason was overruled, the latter ruling was proper because under the statute the case was triable de novo in the district court, upon the merits.Rogers v. Kemp Lumber Co., 1913-NMSC-079, 18 N.M. 300, 137 P. 586.\n\nThe district court could not conduct appellate review absent a written order or other clear indication in the record of the magistrate court's ruling.— In a DWI case, where charges were filed in magistrate court after police arrested defendant for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and where the magistrate court reportedly excluded all of the state's witnesses due to the state's late disclosure, and where the state filed a nolle prosequi and refiled the charges in district court to appeal the exclusion of witnesses underState v. Heinsen, 2005-NMSC-035, and where defendant moved to dismiss the criminal information, arguing that the state had failed to comply with the six-month rule in magistrate court, and that the district court could not hear the refiled case because the magistrate court had not filed a suppression order before the state filed its nolle prosequi, the district court erred when it dismissed the case for a violation of the magistrate court six-month ruling in light of the New Mexico supreme court's withdrawal of the six-month rule in district court, and the district court could not exercise appellate review of the magistrate court's reported exclusion of witnesses absent proof of an order from the magistrate court or other documentation in the magistrate court record of the exclusion ruling.State v. Hobbs, 2024-NMCA-037, cert. granted.\n\nIn an appeal from the magistrate court, the district court's review is not for legal error.— Where defendant was charged in magistrate court with one misdemeanor traffic violation and three petty misdemeanor violations, and where, two days before trial, defendant requested copies of jury questionnaires from the magistrate court clerk, who informed defendant that the magistrate court required a copying fee for copies of the jury questionnaires, and where, the day before trial, defendant filed a verified application for free process for indigency, along with a motion to continue his trial, and where, the next morning, with the jury panel already in the courtroom for jury selection, the magistrate court orally denied defendant's motion to continue, and where, following a jury trial, defendant was convicted on all four counts, and where defendant appealed to the district court and filed a pretrial motion requesting appellate review of the magistrate court clerk's refusal to provide him free copies of the jury questionnaires and of the magistrate court's denial of his motion to continue, and where the district court denied defendant's pretrial motion and held a de novo jury trial, after which, defendant was again convicted on all four counts, and where, on appeal, defendant claimed that the district court should have remanded his case to the magistrate court for a new trial, the district court did not err in providing defendant with a trial de novo, because the district court's review in an appeal from the magistrate court is not for legal error. Defendant's claims of error can only be remedied by a trial de novo in the district court, and no rule permits the district court to remand or otherwise transfer jurisdiction back to the magistrate court for a new trial.State v. Lucero, 2022-NMCA-020, cert. denied.\n\nEffect where material allegations admitted.— Defendant actually had a trial de novo on appeal even though evidence was not introduced where the material allegations of complaint had been admitted.Butler Paper Co. v. Sydney, 1943-NMSC-047, 47 N.M. 463, 144 P.2d 170.\n\nEffect on judgment below.— On appeal to district court, case was tried on its merits de novo; if plaintiff's statement in a cause of action was found defective in substance, contrary judgment below would be reversed.Crolot v. Maloy, 1882-NMSC-004, 2 N.M. 198.\n\nTrial de novo mandatory.— Trial de novo on appeal from justice court (now magistrate court) was mandatory.Butler Paper Co. v. Sydney, 1943-NMSC-047, 47 N.M. 463, 144 P.2d 170.\n\nProcedure on appeal.— If justice court (now magistrate court) had jurisdiction in first instance, then district court would proceed to try case de novo according to district court procedure, and would not follow that of the justice court (magistrate court).Pointer v. Lewis, 1919-NMSC-020, 25 N.M. 260, 181 P. 428.\n\nGrant of summary judgment not error.— Where there was nothing to show the trial court failed to consider the matters he was required to consider by Rule 56(c) [now Rule 1-056C NMRA], N.M.R. Civ. P., grant of summary judgment regardless of magistrate's findings was not error.Southern Union Gas Co. v. Taylor, 1971-NMSC-067, 82 N.M. 670, 486 P.2d 606).\n\nAccounts or setoffs filed.— Parties can file accounts or setoffs, as if the case had originated in the district court.Archibeque v. Miera, 1857-NMSC-003, 1 N.M. 160.\n\nMalicious prosecution.— Where prosecuting witness appealed from judgment of justice (now magistrate) taxing him with costs, district court was required to try the question whether the prosecution was instituted maliciously, or without probable cause, under Laws 1907, ch. 61, § 3 (41-13-5, 1953 Comp., now repealed), de novo, and enter its own independent judgment.State v. Coats, 1913-NMSC-082, 18 N.M. 314, 137 P. 597.\n\nRight to jury trial.— District courts were not bound by rules applicable in justice court (now magistrate court) and on a trial de novo no jury trial was necessary unless some other considerations required it.Reece v. Montano, 1943-NMSC-054, 48 N.M. 1, 144 P.2d 461.\n\nAfter jury trial in magistrate court, defendant not entitled to juryin trial de novo in district court.State v. Haar, 1980-NMCA-065, 94 N.M. 539, 612 P.2d 1350, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 674, 615 P.2d 991, and 449 U.S. 1063, 101 S. Ct. 787, 66 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1980).\n\nDistrict judge may not enhance sentencereceived in magistrate court.State v. Haar, 1980-NMCA-065, 94 N.M. 539, 612 P.2d 1350, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 674, 615 P.2d 991, and 449 U.S. 1063, 101 S. Ct. 787, 66 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1980).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 47 Am. Jur. 2d Justices of the Peace § 84.\n\n51 C.J.S. Justices of the Peace §§ 185 to 212, 272.",

Taylor, 1971-NMSC-067, 82 N.M. 670, 486 P.2d 606.\n\nAmendment to show jurisdiction allowed.— Former statute called for an affirmative showing on the face of the papers as to jurisdictional matters, and where it did not so appear upon any appeal, and yet the jurisdiction actually existed, it was the duty of district court to allow the necessary amendment to show such fact.Tietjen v. McCoy, 1918-NMSC-074, 24 N.M. 164, 172 P. 1144 (decided under former law).\n\nAmendment not sufficient.— Amendment to complaint to show jurisdiction by means of a paper clipped to the complaint was not sufficient.Bell v.
