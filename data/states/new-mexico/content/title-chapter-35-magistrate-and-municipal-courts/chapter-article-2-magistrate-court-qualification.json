No. 69-08.\n\nConstitutionality of lawyer requirement.— The requirement that magistrates in magistrate districts having a population of 100,000 (now 200,000) persons or more be lawyers is a reasonable legislative classification and does not violate N.M.

No. 69-08.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Disorder in the People's Court: Rethinking the Role of Non-Lawyer Judges in Limited Jurisdiction Court\", see 29 N.M.L. Rev. 119 (1999).\n\nAm.
