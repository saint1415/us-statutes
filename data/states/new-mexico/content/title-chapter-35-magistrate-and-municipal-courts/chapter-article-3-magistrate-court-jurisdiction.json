Except as provided in Subsection C of this section, civil jurisdiction extends to actions in contract, quasi-contract and tort and where expressly conferred by law.\n\nC. A magistrate has no jurisdiction in a civil action:\n\n(1) for malicious prosecution, libel or slander;\n\n(2) against public officers for misconduct in office;\n\n(3) for specific performance of contracts for the sale of real property;\n\n(4) in which the title or boundaries of land may be in dispute or drawn into question;\n\n(5) affecting domestic relations, including divorce, annulment or separation or custody, support, guardianship, adoption or dependency of children;\n\n(6) to grant writs of injunction, habeas corpus or extraordinary writs; or\n\n(7) where jurisdiction is vested exclusively in another court.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 36-3-3, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 48; 1973, ch. 206, § 1; 1989, ch. 65, § 1; 1999, ch. 104, § 2; 2001, ch. 77, § 2.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 171, repealed former 36-3-3, 1953 Comp., relating to venue in civil suits, effective January 1, 1969.\n\nCross references.— For jurisdiction of magistrate court,seeRule 2-201B NMRA.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, substituted \"ten thousand dollars ($10,000)\" for \"seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500)\" in Subsection A.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, substituted \"seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500)\" for \"five thousand dollars ($5,000)\" in Subsection A.\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective June 16, 1989, substituted \"five thousand dollars ($5,000)\" for \"two thousand dollars ($2,000)\" in Subsection A, and inserted \"of this section\" in Subsection B.\n\nSome of the following annotations are taken from cases and opinions decided and rendered under former law.\n\nNo jurisdiction where land title or boundary dispute.— Justices of the peace (now magistrates) have no jurisdiction of any matter in controversy when title or boundaries of land are in dispute.Tapia v. Martinez, 1888-NMSC-002, 4 N.M. (Gild.) 329, 16 P. 272.\n\nException to bar of jurisdiction.— Where the title to real estate is drawn in question indirectly or incidentally, statutory and constitutional provisions are not violated.Brown v. Bigham, 1958-NMSC-110, 65 N.M. 45, 331 P.2d 1106.\n\nTest of exception.— Where the statute gives a justice of the peace (now magistrate) jurisdiction, courts are powerless to impose limitations on such jurisdiction by construction. The fact that title to land may be incidentally involved does not oust a justice of the peace (now magistrate) of jurisdiction. Unless otherwise provided by statute, the test as to whether title is so directly involved as to deprive a justice of the peace (now magistrate) of jurisdiction is whether the issues to be litigated demand a judgment affecting title. Where the issues demand a judgment for the recovery of money only, title is not directly involved.State v. Brown, 1963-NMSC-127, 72 N.M. 274, 383 P.2d 243.\n\nEffect on garnishment of rent.— Question of title to land raised only indirectly does not divest justice of peace (now magistrate) of jurisdiction. In garnishment proceeding in which debtor's wife claimed the money deposited in garnishee bank as her own as the rent of her property, the title to land was not involved.Wood Garage v. Jasper, 1937-NMSC-019, 41 N.M. 289, 67 P.2d 1000.\n\nGarnishment in district and magistrate courts.— Since garnishment is both a special proceeding, and a remedial writ, ancillary to the main action, district courts have jurisdiction to issue writs of garnishment in the exercise of their jurisdiction in the main action only to the extent that jurisdiction over such special proceedings as garnishment is conferred by law. Therefore, a district court does not have jurisdiction to issue a writ of garnishment where the amount in question is not in excess of the jurisdictional amount of magistrate courts having venue within the county.Postal Fin. Co. v. Sisneros, 1973-NMSC-029, 84 N.M. 724, 507 P.2d 785.\n\nInjunction.— Metropolitan Court has jurisdiction under the Mobile Home Park Act to issue injunctions.Martinez v. Sedillo, 2005-NMCA-029, 137 N.M. 103, 107 P.3d 543.\n\nJurisdiction on Sundays.— Judicial proceedings other than purely formal acts are void if performed on Sunday. Thus, misdemeanor cases cannot be tried, nor fines imposed, on Sunday. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-05.\n\nEffect on jurisdiction where penalty exceeds limit.— Where the maximum penalty which may be imposed exceeds the jurisdictional limits of the authority of a magistrate, the court thereby loses jurisdiction to try the person accused. To do otherwise would be to lessen the penalties which the legislature has deemed assessable for the named offense. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-188.\n\nMagistrate's monetary jurisdiction limits restitution.— The amount of compelled or agreed restitution in cases involving the Criminal Code or the Motor Vehicle Code is limited by the magistrate's monetary jurisdiction. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-18.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part II,\" see 2 Nat. Resources J. 75 (1962).\n\nFor article, \"Habeas Corpus in New Mexico,\" see 11 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. Magistrates have jurisdiction in all cases of misdemeanors and petty misdemeanors, including offenses and complaints under ordinances of a county. Magistrates also have jurisdiction in any other criminal action where jurisdiction is specifically granted by law, and they may hold preliminary examinations in any criminal action where authorized by law.\n\nB. Magistrates have jurisdiction over all offenses and complaints under ordinances of a municipality and may issue subpoenas and warrants and punish for contempt if that municipality has adopted an effective ordinance to provide for magistrate jurisdiction over municipal ordinances pursuant to the provisions of Subsection B of Section 35-14-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. In any criminal action in the magistrate court which is beyond the jurisdiction of the magistrate court, the magistrate may commit to jail, discharge or recognize the defendant to appear before the district court as provided by law. Whenever the defendant is bound over to the district court, the magistrate shall forthwith deliver to the clerk of the district court a transcript of all proceedings in the magistrate court in the action.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 36-3-4, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 49; 1973, ch. 206, § 2; 1984, ch. 30, § 2; 1985, ch. 59, § 1; 1985, ch. 147, § 1.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 171, repealed former 36-3-4, 1953 Comp., relating to grounds for change of venue, effective January 1, 1969.\n\nCross references.— For sheriff's fees,see4-41-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor jurisdiction for assault and battery upon revenue bureau employees,see7-1-75 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor jurisdiction under fish and game laws,see17-2-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor duties of enforcement officials in gambling prosecutions,see30-19-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor transfer to district court because of insanity defense,see31-9-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nDelay in enforcing sentence.— Where the court delayed enforcing defendant's sentence for thirteen months due to a mistake as to whether defendant was serving the sentence during and after an appeal, the court did not lose jurisdiction to enforce the sentence.State v. Calabaza, 2011-NMCA-053, 149 N.M. 612, 252 P.3d 836.\n\nJurisdiction in felony cases.— The dismissal of a felony charge by a magistrate does not result in an acquittal because the magistrate court has no jurisdiction to try felony charges. Consequently, a subsequent indictment is not barred even if the magistrate determines in a preliminary hearing that there is no probable cause to bind over for trial in the district court. Moreover, since the magistrate court has no such jurisdiction, no double jeopardy problem can arise.State v. Peavler, 1975-NMSC-035, 88 N.M. 125, 537 P.2d 1387.\n\nA magistrate court does not have jurisdiction to try felony charges on the merits, but does have jurisdiction to hold preliminary hearings in any criminal action as authorized by law.McCormick v. Francoeur, 1983-NMSC-077, 100 N.M. 560, 673 P.2d 1293;State v. De La O, 1985-NMCA-023, 102 N.M. 638, 698 P.2d 911.\n\nJurisdiction over aggravated battery.— Magistrate courts have no trial jurisdiction over aggravated battery, which is a third-degree felony, but do have authority to conduct preliminary examinations upon charges therefor.State ex rel. Moreno v. Floyd, 1973-NMSC-117, 85 N.M. 699, 516 P.2d 670.\n\nJurisdiction under 66-8-102 NMSA 1978.— Section 66-8-102 NMSA 1978 is a valid, specific grant of concurrent jurisdiction to magistrates in cases involving driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of drugs, when the same is a first offense.State v. Rue, 1963-NMSC-090, 72 N.M. 212, 382 P.2d 697.\n\nNo jurisdiction over misdemeanor charges tried with related felony.— Because the district court has original jurisdiction over all felony charges, when misdemeanor charges brought in a magistrate's court are linked to a felony charge arising out of the same transaction, the trial should be in the district court.State v. Muise, 1985-NMCA-090, 103 N.M. 382, 707 P.2d 1192,overruled on other grounds byState v. Laguna, 1999-NMCA-152, 128 N.M. 345, 992 P.2d 896.\n\nNo jurisdiction as to municipal ordinances.— Magistrate courts are part of the judicial department of the state and their criminal jurisdiction does not specifically refer to municipal ordinances.State v. Biswell, 1971-NMCA-111, 83 N.M. 65, 488 P.2d 115, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 57, 488 P.2d 107.\n\nNo right to refuse second complaint after finding of no probable cause on first.— A magistrate, who has previously heard evidence under an original criminal complaint and has found no probable cause, does not have a discretionary right to refuse the filing of a second complaint.State v. De La O, 1985-NMCA-023, 102 N.M. 638, 698 P.2d 911.\n\nFormer Rule 17(b) [new 6-506B NMRA], N.M.R. Crim. P. (Magis. Cts.) did not conflictwith this section, by extending the dispositive powers of magistrates to cover felony charges.State v. Mann, 1980-NMSC-043, 94 N.M. 276, 609 P.2d 723 (decided under prior law).\n\nConsent or waiver of jurisdiction not possible.— Where magistrate court is without subject-matter jurisdiction, there is no possibility of waiver or consent to jurisdiction.State v. Lynch, 1971-NMCA-049, 82 N.M. 532, 484 P.2d 374.\n\nA claim of a constitutional or a statutory violation does not implicate a magistrate court's subject matter jurisdiction.— Where defendant was charged in magistrate court with one misdemeanor traffic violation and three petty misdemeanor violations, and where, two days before trial, defendant requested copies of jury questionnaires from the magistrate court clerk, who informed defendant that the magistrate court required a copying fee for copies of the jury questionnaires, and where, the day before trial, defendant filed a verified application for free process for indigency, along with a motion to continue his trial, and where, the next morning, with the jury panel already in the courtroom for jury selection, the magistrate court orally denied defendant's motion to continue, and where, following a jury trial, defendant was convicted on all four counts, and where defendant appealed to the district court and filed a pretrial motion requesting appellate review of the magistrate court clerk's refusal to provide him free copies of the jury questionnaires and of the magistrate court's denial of his motion to continue his trial, and where the district court denied defendant's pretrial motion and held a de novo jury trial, after which, defendant was again convicted on all four counts, and where, on appeal, defendant claimed that the magistrate court lost subject matter jurisdiction by proceeding to trial with an \"anonymous\" jury, defendant's claim is without merit because the legislature has provided by statute that magistrates have jurisdiction in all cases of misdemeanors and petty misdemeanors, and because the motor vehicle offenses with which defendant was charged are misdemeanors and petty misdemeanors, the magistrate court had subject matter jurisdiction, and defendant's claim of procedural violations does not implicate the magistrate court's subject matter jurisdiction.State v. Lucero, 2022-NMCA-020, cert. denied.\n\nConsideration of jurisdiction not precluded on appeal.— The failure of defendant to file an answer or plea in the justice of the peace court (now magistrate) or the district court does not preclude consideration on appeal where the issue raised by defendant questions the sufficiency of the proof to establish a cause of action under the complaint.Henderson v. Gibbany, 1966-NMSC-172, 76 N.M. 674, 417 P.2d 807 (decided under former law).\n\nJurisdiction over violations of municipal ordinances.— A municipal court does not have exclusive jurisdiction where driving while intoxicated or acts of domestic violence are alleged to have occurred within the city limits and to violate both state laws and municipal ordinances and a municipal peace officer may refer criminal charges to any prosecutor at any level for evaluation and prosecution in municipal, magistrate, or district court. Nothing in the law binds an officer to file charges in municipal court where the charges stem from activities that allegedly violate a municipal ordinance and a state law or a county ordinance. 2008 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 08-06.\n\nMagistrate can compel restitution.— The magistrate may, as part of its sentencing power, order a Criminal Code or Motor Vehicle Code violator to make restitution. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-18.\n\nJurisdiction over juveniles.— Magistrate courts have no jurisdiction over juveniles under 18 years of age. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-91.\n\nJurisdiction on Sunday.— Judicial proceedings other than purely formal acts are void if performed on Sunday. Thus, misdemeanor cases cannot be tried, nor fines imposed, on Sunday. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-05 (opinion rendered under former law).\n\nJurisdiction over sentence modification.— Since a magistrate has no power to grant a new trial, he has no power to alter, change or suspend either the fine or a jail sentence after he has issued a jail commitment to the county sheriff even if defendant were less than 21 (now 18) years of age. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-91.\n\nJurisdiction for Motor Transportation Act violations.— Section 35-3-4 NMSA 1978, prior to its 1973 amendment, did not give magistrate courts jurisdiction to try cases arising out of violations of the Motor Transportation Act (65-1-1 to 65-1-37, 65-3-1, 65-5-1 to 65-5-3, 66-6-2, 66-7-411 to 66-7-415 NMSA 1978). 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-53.\n\nNo jurisdiction where penalty exceeds statutory limits.— If the penalty for a misdemeanor set by the legislature prescribes a fine or imprisonment or both and either the fine or penalty exceeds the statutory jurisdictional limits of magistrate's courts, these courts are without jurisdiction to try such a violation. This does not disturb the jurisdiction of misdemeanors specifically granted to magistrate's courts by the legislature. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-148.\n\nMaximum penalty determines jurisdiction.— Where the maximum penalty which may be imposed exceeds the jurisdictional limits of the authority of a magistrate, the court thereby loses jurisdiction to try the person accused. To do otherwise would be to lessen the penalties which the legislature has deemed assessable for the named offense. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-188.\n\nAm.

      "text": "A. The territorial jurisdiction of a magistrate is coextensive with the magistrate district in which the magistrate serves. A magistrate also has jurisdiction in any criminal action involving violation of a law relating to motor vehicles arising in a magistrate district adjoining at any point that in which the magistrate serves and within magistrate trial jurisdiction; provided that the defendant is entitled to a change of venue to the district where the cause of action arose if the defendant so moves at, or within fifteen days after, arraignment.\n\nB. A magistrate has jurisdiction to sit in any action arising in any other magistrate district when designated for a specific period of time by a district judge because of the unavailability of a magistrate in that magistrate district. A magistrate acting in another magistrate district by designation pursuant to this subsection shall include the cases heard by designation in the magistrate's own reports to the administrative office of the courts, indicating on the reports that the magistrate's jurisdiction is by designation.\n\nC. In a criminal action in which a magistrate has territorial jurisdiction over the offense pursuant to this section, the magistrate court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant for the purpose of service of process upon the defendant wherever the defendant resides or may be found within the state.\n\nD. In a civil action arising within the magistrate's territorial jurisdiction, the magistrate court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant for the purpose of service of process upon the defendant wherever the defendant resides or may be found within the state.\n\nE.

Att'y Gen. No. 79-12.\n\nVenue provision does not violate New Mexico constitution.— Article II, § 14 of the New Mexico constitution provides a constitutional right to venue, but does not provide an absolute right to venue, and therefore 35-3-6(A) NMSA 1978, which provides that where there is a violation of a law relating to motor vehicles, law enforcement may properly initiate a criminal action in a magistrate court when the crime that is alleged to occur arose in a neighboring magistrate district, does not conflict with N.M. Const., Art. II, § 14, because 35-3-6(A) NMSA 1978 provides that a defendant may affirmatively assert his constitutional privilege to move venue to the district where the cause of action arose but may also waive his or her right to change venue.Magistrate Court Venue Involving Motor Vehicle Law Violations(2/26/15), Att'y Gen.

No person shall be punished for contempt of the magistrate court until given an opportunity to be heard in his defense. Any person convicted under this section may appeal to the district court in the same manner as in other criminal actions in the magistrate court.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 36-3-9, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 54; 1975, ch. 242, § 3; 1991, ch. 82, § 2.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 171, repealed former 36-3-9, 1953 Comp., relating to officers' fees for carrying removed justice's papers to another justice, effective January 1, 1969.\n\nCross references.— For procedures governing appeals to the district court from magistrate courts in trial de novo cases,seeRule 1-072 NMRA.\n\nFor contempt,seeRules 2-110 and 2-502E NMRA.\n\nFor applicability of Rules of Evidence to contempt proceedings,seeRule 11-1101 NMRA.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, deleted the former third sentence which read \"After hearing, any person found guilty of contempt shall be punished by a fine not exceeding twenty-five dollars ($25.00) or by imprisonment for not more than three days, or both.\"\n\nSix-day contempt sentence.— Defendant's six-day sentence by the metropolitan court for criminal contempt upon failure to pay fines or do community service in lieu of the fines was not in excess of the court's authority, as the power to punish for contempt is inherent in the courts and the magistrate and metropolitan (which is a magistrate) court rules governing contempt control over this section.State v.
