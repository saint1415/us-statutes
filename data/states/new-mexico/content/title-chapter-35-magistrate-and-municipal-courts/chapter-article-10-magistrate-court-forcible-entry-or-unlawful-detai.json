      "text": "A. A civil action for forcible entry or unlawful detainer of real property is commenced by the filing of a civil complaint alleging that one or more of the following facts exists:\n\n(1) the defendant entered and occupied the lands and tenements of another against the will or consent of the owner and refused to vacate the premises after notice by the owner or his agent or attorney;\n\n(2) the defendant holds over after the termination, or contrary to the terms of, his lease or tenancy;\n\n(3) the defendant fails to pay rent at the time stipulated for payment;\n\n(4) the defendant continues in possession after a sale by foreclosure of mortgage or on execution unless the defendant claims by a title paramount to the mortgage under which the sale was made or by title derived from the purchaser at the sale; or\n\n(5) the defendant is a tenant from month to month or a tenant at will and continues in possession of the premises after thirty days' written notice by the owner or his agent or attorney to vacate.\n\nB. The district court of the county in which the real property is located has concurrent original jurisdiction in civil actions for forcible entry or unlawful detainer when the rent contracted for amounts to fifty dollars ($50.00) or more a month or when the reasonable rental value of the premises is fifty dollars ($50.00) or more a month.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 36-12-1, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 122.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 171, repealed former 36-12-1, 1953 Comp., relating to jurisdiction in criminal cases, effective January 1, 1969.\n\nCross references.— For jurisdictional amount of magistrate court,see35-3-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nAction for unlawful detainer is purely statutoryand is restricted in its operation to the situations specified in the statute.Ott v. Keller, 1976-NMCA-124, 90 N.M. 1, 558 P.2d 613.\n\nUnlawful detainer is a summary proceeding;an equitable owner under a real estate contract cannot be ousted from possession by a summary proceeding, and the question of title to land cannot be determined in an unlawful detainer action.Ott v. Keller, 1976-NMCA-124, 90 N.M. 1, 558 P.2d 613.\n\nEffect of action.— An action for forcible entry or unlawful detainer settles nothing between the parties, does not determine title to the property or the absolute right to possession, and only places the parties in their original positions prior to the forcible entry or unlawful detainer. Ott v. Keller, 1976-NMCA-124, 90 N.M. 1, 558 P.2d 613.\n\nSufficiency of complaint.— Substantial compliance with statutory form of complaint in a forcible entry and detainer action was sufficient.Heron v. Kelly, 1944-NMSC-007, 48 N.M. 123, 146 P.2d 851;Puckett v. Walz, 1937-NMSC-055, 41 N.M. 612, 72 P.2d 623;Springer v. Wasson, 1917-NMSC-065, 23 N.M. 277, 167 P. 712 (decided under former law).\n\nSufficiency of proof.— It is unnecessary to prove a forcible entry, proof of unlawful detainer being sufficient.Springer v. Wasson, 1919-NMSC-038, 25 N.M. 379, 183 P. 398 (decided under former law).\n\nSufficiency of description of land.— In forcible entry and detainer suit, the description should be so definite and certain that the premises may be readily identified, but reasonable and not absolute certainty is all that is required.Patten v. Balch, 1910-NMSC-008, 15 N.M. 276, 106 P. 388;Sanchez v. Luna, 1857-NMSC-012, 1 N.M. 238 (decided under former law).\n\nAffidavit of jurisdictional amount.— Before a suit in forcible entry and detainer or unlawful detainer can be instituted in the district court, an affidavit must be made showing that the reasonable rental value of the premises is $50.00 or more per month.Kuykendall v. Ulibarri, 1952-NMSC-007, 56 N.M. 43, 239 P.2d 731 (decided under former law).\n\nComplaint as whole to be examined.— Where jurisdiction of the district court depends upon the amount in controversy, the complaint as a whole is to be examined to determine whether the requisite jurisdiction exists.Kuykendall v. Ulibarri, 1952-NMSC-007, 56 N.M. 43, 239 P.2d 731 (decided under former law).\n\nAction by peaceable possessor.— Where one is in quiet and peaceable possession of land belonging to the United States and is ousted by an intruder, he may maintain an action of forcible entry and detainer, even though his possession and occupation was without authority of law.Murrah v. Acrey, 1914-NMSC-051, 19 N.M. 228, 142 P. 143 (decided under former law).\n\nInterference with a tenant's right of ingress and egress is actionable.Wal-Go Assocs. v. Leon, 1981-NMSC-022, 95 N.M. 565, 624 P.2d 507.\n\nWhen suit precluded by 35-10-3 NMSA 1978.— Where defendants purchased ranch four years prior and remained in possession and plaintiff does not claim any possession prior to that, has never been in possession either as owner, tenant or in any other capacity, but bases title on a disputed contract between the parties, the plaintiff's title is so directly and inextricably involved in the action for unlawful detainer that suit is precluded by 35-10-3C NMSA 1978.Reinhart v. Lindholm, 1972-NMSC-087, 84 N.M. 546, 505 P.2d 1222.\n\nEnforcement of right of way not permitted either.— Action of forcible entry and detainer did not lie to enforce a right of way.Roberts v. Trujillo, 1884-NMSC-005, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 87, 1 P. 855 (decided under former law).\n\nJurisdiction on Apache reservation.— Despite the fact that the Apache reservation land upon which plaintiff's house is located was fee patent land, presumably granted under the Indian Allotment Act, and that the Mescalero tribal law makes no provision for a wrongful entry and detainer action, nevertheless the state may not assume jurisdiction without congressional or tribal authorization.Chino v. Chino, 1977-NMSC-020, 90 N.M. 203, 561 P.2d 476.\n\nJurisdiction not ousted by raising of title.— If title to real estate was raised only indirectly, it would not oust the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace (now magistrate).Wood Garage v. Jasper, 1937-NMSC-019, 41 N.M. 289, 67 P.2d 1000 (decided under former law).\n\nEffect of default on real estate sales contract.— A real estate sales contract is not a lease or tenancy since it does not involve a landlord-tenant relationship during the existence of the contract, and the contract cannot, after default, transform a vendor-vendee relationship into one of landlord-tenant despite provisions which attempt to do so; thus, an unlawful detainer action does not arise out of a vendor-vendee relationship, the vendee in possession was not a tenant in any sense of the word, his default did not make him a tenant, and consequently, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter.Ott v. Keller, 1976-NMCA-124, 90 N.M. 1, 558 P.2d 613.\n\nProceeding inequitable.— A summary unlawful detainer proceeding was inequitable to defendant-vendees, whose counterclaim and demand for a jury were disregarded by the trial court when it terminated defendants' contract, evicted the defendants from their residence, forfeited all sums paid (approximately 25% of the purchase price) and ordered defendants to pay plaintiffs' attorney's fees and costs.Ott v. Keller, 1976-NMCA-124, 90 N.M. 1, 558 P.2d 613.\n\nWhen right of possession arises at foreclosure sale.— The right of possession in a purchaser at a foreclosure sale arises upon the issuance to him of a commissioner's deed.Minor v. Riebold, 1974-NMSC-033, 86 N.M. 279, 523 P.2d 14.\n\nEffect of foreclosure decree sale on mortgagor possession.— A mortgagor of real estate is not entitled to retain possession of property after confirmation of sale under decree of foreclosure.Gunby v. Doughton, 1924-NMSC-063, 30 N.M. 144, 228 P. 603 (decided under former law).\n\nWaiver of notice to vacate.— In an action of unlawful detainer, notice to vacate may be waived by the defendant.Board of Educ. v. Astler, 1914-NMSC-081, 21 N.M. 1, 151 P. 462 (decided under former law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For survey, \"The Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act,\" see 6 N.M. L. Rev. 293 (1976).\n\nAm.

      "text": "A. Except as provided in Section 35-10-1 NMSA 1978, three days' notice in writing to quit must be given to the defendant before a civil action for forcible entry or unlawful detainer may be filed.\n\nB. The return day of the summons in an action for forcible entry or unlawful detainer shall be not less than three, nor more than ten, days from the time of service of the civil complaint and summons on the defendant. Except by consent of the parties, no continuance shall be granted for more than ten days.\n\nC. The questions of title or boundaries of land shall not be investigated in an action for forcible entry or unlawful detainer, but the action does not prevent a party from testing the right of property in any other manner. An action for forcible entry or unlawful detainer may not be brought in connection with any other action, nor may it be made the subject of setoff.\n\nD. The right of a landlord in an action for forcible entry or unlawful detainer is not affected by the underleasing of his tenant.\n\nE. When a lessee has been induced to take a lease by means of force, fraud or intimidation, he may plead a paramount title in himself, an outstanding title or the want of title in the lessor.\n\nF. Legal representatives of a person who, if alive, might have brought an action for forcible entry or unlawful detainer may bring the action after his death.\n\nG. All laws and procedures governing magistrate courts apply to actions for forcible entry or unlawful detainer in the magistrate court except as otherwise provided by law.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 36-12-2, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 123.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 171, repealed former 36-12-2, 1953 Comp., relating to disqualification of justice by interest or relationship, effective January 1, 1969.\n\nSufficiency of notice.— The notice to quit should be sufficiently definite to inform the tenant of the meaning of the notice, but the landlord's signature is not indispensable.Lund v. Ozanne, 1906-NMSC-001, 13 N.M. 293, 84 P. 710 (decided under former law).\n\nWhere sufficient.— Allegation in complaint \"that on a certain day, to wit, the 30th day of September, 1949, at said county, demand in writing was duly made by plaintiff of said defendant for, and requiring the payment, said rent then due, amounting to the said sum of $4000., or the possession of said demised property, but said defendant neglected and refused for the space of three whole days and upward, after demand so made as aforesaid, and still neglects and refuses, to pay said rent, or surrender possession of said premises,\" sufficiently alleged statutory notice.Kuykendall v. Ulibarri, 1952-NMSC-007, 56 N.M. 43, 239 P.2d 731 (decided under former law).\n\nDefenses allowed.— This section allows any defense, whether legal or equitable, to be raised that does not try title or boundaries to the disputed property.Wal-Go Assocs. v. Leon, 1981-NMSC-022, 95 N.M. 565, 624 P.2d 507.\n\nSuit precluded by Subsection C.— Where defendants purchased ranch four years prior and remained in possession and plaintiff does not claim any possession prior to that, has never been in possession either as owner, tenant or in any other capacity, but bases title on a disputed contract between the parties, the plaintiff's title is so directly and inextricably involved in the action for unlawful detainer that suit is precluded by 35-10-3C NMSA 1978.Reinhart v. Lindholm, 1972-NMSC-087, 84 N.M. 546, 505 P.2d 1222.\n\nReal estate provisions not violated.— Where the title to real estate is drawn in question indirectly or incidentally, statutory and constitutional provisions are not violated.Brown v. Bigham, 1958-NMSC-110, 65 N.M. 45, 331 P.2d 1106 (decided under former law).\n\nQuestion of title resolved previously.— Prohibition in Subsection C against investigation of questions of title in unlawful detainer actions did not mean that magistrate court and district court lacked jurisdiction to decide whether plaintiff was entitled to possession of property which he had purchased at foreclosure sale but which defendant had failed to vacate, since the only question of title, that of the validity of the order of the district court under which the deed was issued to the plaintiff, had previously been resolved against the defendant.Minor v. Riebold, 1974-NMSC-033, 86 N.M. 279, 523 P.2d 14.\n\nTrial by jury.— Right to a trial by jury does not exist in an action for forcible entry and detainer in the absence of statutory authority.Reece v.
