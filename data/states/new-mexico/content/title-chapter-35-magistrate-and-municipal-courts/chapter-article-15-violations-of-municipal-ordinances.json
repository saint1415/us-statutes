      "text": "A. All actions to enforce any ordinance of any municipality shall be brought in the name of the municipality as plaintiff. No prosecution, conviction or acquittal for the violation of an ordinance is a defense to any other prosecution of the same party for any other violation of an ordinance, although different causes of action existed at the same time and, if united, would have exceeded the jurisdiction of the court.\n\nB. The plaintiff or defendant may appeal to the district court from the judgment of any municipal court within fifteen days after judgment and sentence rendered in the municipal court. Failure of either party to appeal within the prescribed time is jurisdictional and an appeal not timely filed shall not be entertained by the district court.\n\nHistory:Laws 1884, ch. 39, § 17; C.L. 1884, § 1625; C.L. 1897, § 2405; Code 1915, § 3627; C.S. 1929, § 90-907; 1941 Comp., § 39-201; 1953 Comp., § 38-1-1; Laws 1959, ch. 169, § 1; 1961, ch. 208, § 10; 1963, ch. 10, § 1; 1969, ch. 35, § 1.\n\nNo chilling effect on right to appeal.— There was no \"chilling effect\" on defendant's right to appeal his conviction for violation of certain municipal ordinances where he took an appeal to the district court and requiring defendant to choose between accepting the risk of a greater sentence or foregoing his appeal was not constitutionally impermissible under the facts of the case since the choice was defendant's.City of Farmington v. Sandoval, 1977-NMCA-022, 90 N.M. 246, 561 P.2d 945.\n\nValidity of ordinances authorizing commitment.— If a fine is imposed, an order may be made for commitment until the fine and costs are paid; although such proceedings are not criminal, being at most quasi-criminal, ordinances authorizing commitment are valid.In re Roe Chung, 1897-NMSC-016, 9 N.M. 130, 49 P. 952.\n\nCity attorney may represent municipality.— City attorney may prosecute violations of municipal ordinances in district court without authorization from the district attorney.City of Roswell v.

In any action for the violation of any ordinance in which an arrest has not been made, a warrant for the arrest of the defendant may issue in the first instance upon the affidavit of any person making a complaint that he has reasonable grounds to believe the party charged is guilty. Any person arrested upon such warrant shall, without unnecessary delay, be taken before the proper officer to be tried for the alleged offense or be allowed to post an appropriate bond.\n\nB. Any municipality may provide by ordinance that the first process shall be a citation or summons in cases involving violations of any municipal ordinance not amounting to a breach of the peace, requiring the party charged to appear before the municipal court at a time fixed in the citation or summons. The ordinance may also provide that, upon the failure of the party charged to appear, a warrant for his arrest shall immediately issue by the municipal judge for the offense specified in the citation or summons, commanding that the party charged shall be arrested and proceedings had as in the case when arrest is made upon a warrant issued upon affidavit as provided in Subsection A of this section.\n\nC. Any person upon whom any fine or penalty is imposed may, upon order of the court convicting him, be committed to the county jail, municipal jail, detention facility or other place provided by the municipality for the incarceration of offenders until the fine or penalty is fully paid. The period of incarceration shall not exceed sixty days for any one offense except as authorized in Subsection C of Section 3-17-1 NMSA 1978. The municipal governing body may provide by ordinance that every person so committed shall work for the municipal corporation, at such labor as his strength will permit, within or without the jail or other place provided for the incarceration, not exceeding ten hours each working day.

The governing body of any municipality may provide by ordinance that the municipal court may, upon entry of a plea of guilty or judgment of conviction:\n\n(1) suspend in whole or part the execution of sentence; or\n\n(2) place the defendant on probation for a period not exceeding one year on terms and conditions the court deems best; or both.
