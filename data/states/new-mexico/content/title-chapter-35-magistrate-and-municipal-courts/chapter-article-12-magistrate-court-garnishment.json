      "text": "A. Garnishment may be issued in advance of judgment in a civil action in the magistrate court only upon the filing of a civil complaint, accompanied by:\n\n(1) a bond to the defendant, with sufficient sureties, in double the sum claimed in the complaint, conditioned that the plaintiff will diligently prosecute the action to final judgment without delay, will pay to the defendant all money found due to him in the action and will pay the defendant and the garnishee all damages and costs sustained from the garnishment if no judgment is recovered from the defendant in the action; and\n\n(2) an affidavit of the plaintiff that one or more of the following facts exists:\n\n(a) the defendant has no property in his possession within this state subject to execution to satisfy the amount claimed in the complaint; or\n\n(b) one or more of the grounds for issuance of attachment in the magistrate court, the applicable grounds to be stated in the affidavit.\n\nB. Garnishment may be issued in aid of execution of judgment entered in a civil action in the magistrate court only upon the filing in the action of an affidavit of the plaintiff that the defendant has no property in his possession within this state subject to execution to satisfy the judgment.\n\nC. Garnishment may be issued in the magistrate court in aid of execution of judgment, which was entered in a civil action in some other court in this state and the unpaid balance of which does not exceed the jurisdictional amount of the magistrate court, only upon the filing of a civil complaint together with a certified copy of the judgment and an affidavit of the plaintiff that the defendant has no property in his possession within this state subject to execution to satisfy the judgment.\n\nD. The affidavit under Subsections A through C shall include a statement that the plaintiff believes that a named garnishee:\n\n(1) is indebted to the defendant and that the debt is not exempt from garnishment; or\n\n(2) holds personal property belonging to the defendant.\n\nE. Any magistrate who issues a garnishment in any civil action except in compliance with the provisions of this section is guilty of a petty misdemeanor and shall be removed from office.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 36-14-1, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 133; 1969, ch. 139, § 3.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 171, repealed former 36-14-1, 1953 Comp., relating to initiation of peace proceedings, effective January 1, 1969.\n\nCross references.— For jurisdictional amount of magistrate courts,see35-3-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor rules governing garnishment in the district, magistrate, and metropolitan courts,seeRules 1-065.2, 2-802, and 3-802 NMRA, respectively.\n\nFor form for claim of exemptions on executions,seeRule 4-803 NMRA.\n\nFor form for order on claim of exemption and order to pay in execution proceedings,seeRule 4-804 NMRA.\n\nFor form for application for writ of garnishment and affidavit,seeRule 4-805 NMRA.\n\nFor form for notice of right to claim exemptions from execution,seeRule 4-808A NMRA.\n\nFor form for claim of exemption from garnishment,seeRule 4-809 NMRA.\n\nDue process not violated.— Due process does not require that a judgment debtor shall be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before issuance of a garnishment to satisfy the judgment, since the judgment debtor would have already been provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard in the proceeding that resulted in the judgment against him; in addition, the plaintiffs had actual notice of the garnishment, were represented by counsel, and made no attempt to claim the exemptions which they alleged were denied them without notice and a hearing.Moya v. DeBaca, 286 F. Supp. 606 (D.N.M. 1968), appeal dismissed, 395 U.S. 825, 89 S. Ct. 2136, 23 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1969) (decided under former law).\n\nReaching of exempt property.— Garnishment was not a device by which exempt property could be reached.McFadden v. Murray, 1927-NMSC-039, 32 N.M. 361, 257 P. 999 (decided under former law).\n\nGarnishment proceedings are a statutory remedywhich are controlled by this chapter.Jemko, Inc. v. Liaghat, 1987-NMCA-069, 106 N.M. 50, 738 P.2d 922.\n\nGarnishment of husband's income for wife's debts.— Since one-half of husband's income is available to satisfy wife's separate debt, because wife has a legally recognized interest in one-half of husband's income, creditor's post-judgment garnishment of one-half of husband's income was garnishment of its judgment debtor's wife's property, not husband's, and husband lacks standing to claim denial of due process.Cent. Adjustment Bureau, Inc. v. Thevenet, 1984-NMSC-083, 101 N.M. 612, 686 P.2d 954).\n\nJoinder of spouses jointly obligated on promissory note.— Where husband is judgment debtor and the judgment of the trial court in a garnishment proceeding indicates that garnishee is indebted on a promissory note to husband and wife, if the note is not a community asset, both payees under the note should be joined so as to adjudicate their respective rights under the note, but if the note is a community asset, wife would be considered a proper but not indispensable party.Jemko, Inc. v. Liaghat, 1987-NMCA-069, 106 N.M. 50, 738 P.2d 922.\n\nJurisdiction.— A court has no jurisdiction to proceed in garnishment, even though it is a court of general jurisdiction, unless such jurisdiction is expressly conferred by statute. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-85.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Attachment and Garnishment - Prejudgment Garnishment - Study and Proposed Revisions,\" see 9 Nat.

The garnishment shall be served on the garnishee within the magistrate district in the manner provided by law for service of a civil summons in the magistrate court and shall order the garnishee in the action to appear before the magistrate within twenty days from the date of service to answer under oath, as of the date the garnishment was served and also as of the date of the garnishee's answer:\n\n(1) what, if anything, the garnishee is indebted to the defendant and on what account;\n\n(2) what, if any, personal property of the defendant is in the garnishee's possession; and\n\n(3) what other persons, if any, within the garnishee's knowledge are indebted to the defendant or have personal property of the defendant in their possession.\n\nB.

      "text": "A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, service of a garnishment on the garnishee has the effect of attaching all personal property, money, wages or salary in excess of the amount exempt under Section 35-12-7 NMSA 1978, rights, credits, bonds, bills, notes, drafts and other choses in action of the defendant in the garnishee's possession or under his control at the time of service of the garnishment or which may come into his possession or under his control or be owing by him between the time of service and the time of making his answer. The garnishee is not liable for any judgment in money on account of any bonds, bills, notes, drafts, checks or other choses in action unless they are converted into money after service of the garnishment or he fails to deliver them to the magistrate within the time prescribed by the magistrate.\n\nB. Service of a garnishment issued in advance of judgment does not attach any wages or salary due the defendant from the garnishee.\n\nC. After service of a garnishment on the garnishee, it is unlawful for the garnishee to pay to the defendant in the action any debt or to deliver to him any personal property attached by the garnishment.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 36-14-3, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 135; 1969, ch. 139, § 4.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 171, repealed former 36-14-3, 1953 Comp., relating to requiring bond for assault or threat in presence of justice, effective January 1, 1969.\n\nThe garnishor/judgment creditor acquires the judgment debtor's right of action against the garnishee.— The effect of garnishment is that the garnishor/judgment creditor is subrogated to the rights of the judgment debtor as against the garnishee, and the garnishor/judgment creditor cannot prevail against the garnishee unless the judgment debtor could do so. The primary test for whether garnishment is appropriate is whether the judgment debtor has a valid right of action against the garnishee for the subject sought to be garnished.Kirby v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 2010-NMSC-014, 148 N.M. 106, 231 P.3d 87,rev'gKirby v. Long-Term Disability Plan of TAD Resources Int'l, Inc., 2008-NMCA-154, 145 N.M. 264, 196 P. 3d 965.\n\nTo be garnishable, the subject of garnishment must be mature, and not subject to any contingency or defense.Kirby v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 2010-NMSC-014, 148 N.M. 106, 231 P.3d 87,rev'gKirby v. Long-Term Disability Plan of TAD Resources Int'l, Inc., 2008-NMCA-154, 145 N.M. 264, 196 P. 3d 965.\n\nGarnishment not preempted by ERISA.— The federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001 to 1461 (2000), does not preempt or preclude a state law garnishment action against an ERISA insurer to enforce a judgment entered against an ERISA Plan.Kirby v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 2010-NMSC-014, 148 N.M. 106, 231 P.3d 87,rev'gKirby v. Long-Term Disability Plan of TAD Resources Int'l, Inc., 2008-NMCA-154, 145 N.M. 264, 196 P. 3d 965.\n\nGarnishment against insurer of long-term disability plan to satisfy a judgment against an insured ERISA plan.— Garnishment is an appropriate mechanism to enforce a money judgment against a plan covered by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001 to 1461 (2000), where the subject of garnishment is an insurance policy obligating the insurer to pay disability benefits directly to eligible plan beneficiaries.Kirby v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 2010-NMSC-014, 148 N.M. 106, 231 P.3d 87,rev'gKirby v. Long-Term Disability Plan of TAD Resources Int'l, Inc., 2008-NMCA-154, 145 N.M. 264, 196 P. 3d 965.\n\nGarnishment against insurer of long-term disability plan.— Plaintiff's employer established a long-term disability plan that was funded by an insurance policy issued by the defendant; defendant acted as the claims fiduciary of the plan; defendant denied plaintiff's claim for disability benefits under the plan; plaintiff sued the plan and defendant in state court for wrongful denial of benefits; plaintiff's complaint against defendant was dismissed with prejudice on res judicata grounds; plaintiff obtained a default judgment against the plan based on rights accorded under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001 to 1461 (2000); defendant refused to pay the judgment; plaintiff applied for a writ of garnishment against defendant to satisfy the judgment, describing the subject of garnishment as the insurance policy that funded the plan; the insurance policy required defendant to pay benefits when there was a judicial determination that a beneficiary was eligible; the policy imposed a legally binding obligation on defendant, the violation of which gave the plan a valid right of action against defendant; and the right of action was not subject to any contingency or defense, the insurance policy itself was not a garnishable asset, but the right of action of the plan against defendant to compel payment of improperly denied disability benefits was an asset of the plan and was properly garnished by plaintiff, standing in the shoes of the plan against defendant, to satisfy the plan's liability to plaintiff.Kirby v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 2010-NMSC-014, 148 N.M. 106, 231 P.3d 87,rev'gKirby v.

Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 2010-NMSC-014, 148 N.M. 106, 231 P.3d 87,rev'gKirby v.

If the garnishee answers under oath that he is not at the time of answer, and was not, at the time the garnishment was served on him, indebted to the defendant or in possession of any personal property of the defendant, and if the garnishee's answer is not controverted within twenty days after being made, the magistrate shall enter judgment discharging the garnishee.\n\nB. If the garnishee fails to answer the garnishment under oath within twenty days from the date of its service on him, the magistrate may render judgment by default against the garnishee for the full amount of any judgment rendered against the defendant, together with all interest and costs.\n\nC. If the garnishee answers under oath or it appears on trial of the issue that he was, at the time of answer or at the time the garnishment was served, indebted to the defendant or in possession of any personal property of the defendant, the magistrate shall render judgment for the plaintiff against the garnishee for the amount admitted or found due to the defendant or so much thereof as equals the plaintiff's judgment against the defendant. If the garnishee is indebted to the defendant for wages or salary, the magistrate shall render judgment for the plaintiff against the garnishee only for the amount of wages or salary due the defendant in excess of the amount of wages or salary exempt from garnishment under Section 35-12-7 NMSA 1978 or so much thereof as equals the plaintiff's judgment against the defendant. The magistrate shall order the garnishee to deliver any personal property to the sheriff to be held by him subject to the order of the magistrate for the satisfaction of any judgment that may be rendered against the defendant. If the garnishee fails to deliver the personal property to the sheriff, the sheriff shall notify the magistrate, and, upon motion of the plaintiff, the garnishee shall be cited for contempt. If the garnishee fails to show good cause in the contempt hearing, he shall be punished for contempt, and the magistrate may render judgment against him for the full amount of the plaintiff's judgment against the defendant, together with all interest and costs.\n\nD. If the defendant is employed by the garnishee, the magistrate shall render judgment for the plaintiff against the garnishee for the unpaid balance of the plaintiff's judgment against the defendant and order the garnishee to pay to the plaintiff each pay period the defendant's wages or salary, which are not exempt from garnishment under Section 35-12-7 NMSA 1978 and which come due subsequent to the time of answer, until the judgment is satisfied, or, if the employment relationship is terminated, until the garnishee gives the plaintiff written notice that the employment relationslhip [relationship] has terminated.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 36-14-4, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 136; 1969, ch. 139, § 5.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nRepeals.— Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 171, repealed former 36-14-4, 1953 Comp., relating to proceedings in district court after giving bond, effective January 1, 1969.\n\nCross references.— For contempt of court,see34-1-2 to 34-1-5 NMSA 1978.\n\nMany of the following annotations are from cases which were decided under former law.\n\nDuty to discharge not mandatory.— Upon failure of plaintiffs to file a traverse of the answer of the garnishee within 20 days after the filing of such answer, it did not become the fixed and mandatory duty of the court, with no alternative available, to enter judgment discharging the garnishee.Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Ledesma, 214 F.2d 495 (10th Cir. 1954).\n\nDuty to discharge discretionary.— When a motion is made to discharge the garnishee under this section, the question whether the court should enter the requested judgment of discharge or enlarge the time within which to file a traverse is one of procedure to be determined by the court in the exercise of its sound judicial discretion, and its action thereon should not be disturbed on appeal unless there is an abuse of discretion.Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Ledesma, 214 F.2d 495 (10th Cir. 1954).\n\nDischarge may be granted.— Where a writ of garnishment is issued and served on appellee, who files an answer to the writ stating it is not indebted to the appellant, which answer does not contain a certificate of service nor a separate instrument so entitled, and appellee files its application to be discharged, this being more than 20 days after the filing of its answer, and appellant files a motion for extension of time to contravene the answer of garnishee, the trial court found that the garnishee's answer was served and was not controverted within the time provided by this section. Also, here, no formal certificate of service was filed, but since there was a letter of transmittal of the answer of garnishee to the clerk which recited that copies had been sent to appellants, and the appellants made no objection to the trial court as to the sufficiency of service, the trial court made a finding that service had been made and denied appellant's motion for an enlargement of time in which to controvert the answer, which was found on appeal not to be an abuse of discretion.Bullock v. Northern Ins. Co., 331 F.2d 431 (10th Cir. 1964).\n\nStop payment.— Non-bank garnishee had no legal duty to stop payment on checks that were sent to payee prior to garnishee being served with writ of garnishment.Central Sec. & Alarm Co. v. Mehler, 1998-NMCA-096, 125 N.M. 438, 963 P.2d 515, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 322, 961 P.2d 167.\n\nDischarge denied.— Where plaintiffs had failed to traverse the answer of the garnishee within 20 days after the filing of an answer under this section, it was a matter of judicial discretion when the court entered an order denying motion to discharge the garnishee and extending until five days after entry of such order the time within which to file a traverse; and the traverse was filed within the extended period.Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Ledesma, 214 F.2d 495 (10th Cir. 1954).\n\nDefense by garnishee as to ownership of funds.— If the garnishee's answer raises doubt about who actually owns funds admittedly held by the garnishee for another, the issues must be tried; the garnishor must establish the debtor's right to the fund, but if the garnishee raises an affirmative defense in its answer, which the garnishor controverts, the garnishee has the burden of proving that defense.Amaya v. Santistevan, 1992-NMCA-051, 114 N.M. 140, 835 P.2d 856.\n\nScope of duty to controvert garnishees' denial.— Where garnishees answered interrogatories by saying that debtor worked for them 12 months, that they were paying nothing for his work, that they had never paid for it and they did not owe for it, answers did not amount to a denial requiring plaintiff to prove more than the value of the services, the work, and the identity of garnishees.Zanz v. Stover, 1880-NMSC-006, 2 N.M. 29.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 6 Am.

Exempt from garnishment in all other situations is the greater of the following portions of the defendant's disposable earnings:\n\n(1) seventy-five percent of the defendant's disposable earnings for any pay period; or\n\n(2) an amount each week equal to forty times the highest applicable minimum hourly wage rate at the place the wages were earned. The director of the financial institutions division of the regulation and licensing department shall provide a table giving equivalent exemptions for pay periods of other than one week.\n\nB. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"disposable earnings\" means that part of a defendant's wage or salary remaining after deducting the amounts that are required by law to be withheld; and\n\n(2) \"highest applicable minimum hourly wage rate\" means the highest federal, state or local minimum hourly wage rate for an eight-hour day and a forty-hour week applicable at the time the wages are payable. However, it is immaterial whether the garnishee is exempt under federal, state or local law from paying the highest applicable minimum hourly wage rate.\n\nC. The maximum amount that may be taken from a spouse's disposable earnings under both the garnishment procedure and the wage deduction procedure for the enforcement of child support is fifty percent of the spouse's disposable earnings.\n\nD. Amounts exempt under this section shall retain their exempt status when deposited into a personal bank account, provided that they are reasonably traceable.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 36-14-7, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 139, § 6; 1978 Comp., § 35-12-7; 1979, ch. 254, § 1; 2023, ch. 104, § 2.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 171, repealed former 36-14-7, 1953 Comp., relating to penalties of justices under peace bond provisions, effective January 1, 1969, and Laws 1968, ch. 62, § 139, enacted a new 36-14-7, 1953 Comp., relating to garnishment exemptions. Laws 1969, ch. 139, § 6, repealed 36-14-7, 1953 Comp., relating to garnishment exemptions, and enacted a new section.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective July 1, 2023, changed an income exemption amount from forty times the federal minimum hourly wage rate to forty times the highest applicable minimum hourly wage rate, defined \"highest applicable minimum hourly wage rate\", and provided that amounts exempt under this section shall retain their exempt status when deposited into a personal bank account; in Subsection A, Paragraph A(2), after \"forty times the\", deleted \"federal\" and added \"highest applicable\", and after \"minimum hourly wage rate\", added \"the place the wages were earned\"; in Subsection B, Paragraph B(2), deleted \"federal\" and added \"highest applicable\", after \"highest federal\", added \"state or local\", after \"forty-hour week\", added \"applicable at the time the wages are payable\", after \"under federal\", added \"state or local\", and after \"paying the\", deleted \"federal\" and added \"highest applicable\"; and added Subsection D.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2023, ch. 104, § 13 provided that the provisions of Laws 2023, ch. 104 apply to actions filed on or after July 1, 2023.\n\nWage garnishment exemption applies only to wages or salary due from judgment debtor's employer to judgment debtor and does not apply to wages or salary once paid to the judgment debtor.— Where debtors filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and elected to claim exemptions under New Mexico law and, in addition to claiming exemptions under 42-10-1 to 42-10-13 NMSA 1978, debtors claimed an exemption under the New Mexico wage garnishment statute, 35-12-7 NMSA 1978, for funds in their bank accounts, and where the Chapter 7 trustee objected to the exemption claimed under the garnishment statute, asserting that the garnishment statute was inapplicable for use by a debtor in bankruptcy to claim an exemption in otherwise non-exempt assets, the trustee's objection was sustained because the wage garnishment exemption contained in the statute applies only to wages or salary due from the employer to the judgment debtor and does not apply to wages or salary once paid to the judgment debtor. Once wages or salary are paid and deposited into a debtor's bank account, a debtor must rely on the general exemption statutes to protect such funds.In re Johnson, 593 B.R. 331 (Bankr. D.
