Where functions of departments overlap or a function assigned to one department could better be performed by another department, a secretary may recommend appropriate legislation to the next session of the legislature for its approval.\n\nE. The secretary may make and adopt such reasonable procedural rules as may be necessary to carry out the duties of the department and its divisions. No rule promulgated by the director of any division in carrying out the functions and duties of the division shall be effective until approved by the secretary unless otherwise provided by statute. Unless otherwise provided by statute, no rule affecting any person or agency outside the department shall be adopted, amended or repealed without a public hearing on the proposed action before the secretary or a hearing officer designated by the secretary. The public hearing shall be held in Santa Fe unless otherwise permitted by statute. Notice of the subject matter of the rule, the action proposed to be taken, the time and place of the hearing, the manner in which interested persons may present their views and the method by which copies of the proposed rule or proposed amendment or repeal of an existing rule may be obtained shall be published once at least thirty days prior to the hearing date in a newspaper of general circulation and mailed at least thirty days prior to the hearing date to all persons who have made a written request for advance notice of hearing. All rules shall be filed in accordance with the State Rules Act [Chapter 14, Article 4 NMSA 1978].\n\nF.

Regulation & Licensing Dep't v.

Att'y Gen. No. 87-58.\n\nLegislative purpose.— By enacting this section, the legislature did not delegate to the governor its power to repeal the statutes governing the individual boards and commissions; such an action would be in contravention of article III, § 1 of the New Mexico constitution. The more reasonable interpretation of the act is that the legislature merely delegated to the regulation and licensing department administrative or ministerial duties with respect to licensing functions of the autonomous boards; the intent of this section is to give the governor the opportunity to select initially which boards would have the regulation and licensing department administer their licensing functions. 1987 Op.
