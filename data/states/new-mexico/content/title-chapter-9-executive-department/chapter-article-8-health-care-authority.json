N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 2018-NMCA-063, cert. denied.\n\nProvider's burden in a department action to recover improper payments.— If a health care provider wishes to challenge the methodology used to choose the sample size of an audit or to randomly select the claims for audit, the relevant regulation requires that, rather than merely choose a different sample size, or select a different set of claims for audit, the provider must audit the entire universe of claims at issue.Counseling Center, Inc. v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 2018-NMCA-063, cert. denied.\n\nThe administrative law judge improperly shifted the burden of proof.— Where the New Mexico human services department (HSD) [health care authority department] appealed the district court's reversal of an administrative decision requiring respondent, a behavioral health care provider, to reimburse HSD for claimed overpayments, and where the administrative law judge (ALJ) failed to reach any conclusion regarding the validity of the alleged failed claims because respondent had not performed a one-hundred percent audit of the universe of provider records, the ALJ improperly shifted the burden of proof to respondent, as respondent was not required to provide a one-hundred percent audit of the universe of providers before the ALJ could properly consider whether the claims used to extrapolate respondent's alleged overpayment actually failed.Counseling Center, Inc. v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 2018-NMCA-063, cert. denied.\n\nSubstantial evidence of over payment of medicaid funds.— Where the New Mexico human services department (HSD) [health care authority department] appealed the district court's reversal of an administrative decision requiring respondent, a behavioral health care provider, to reimburse HSD for claimed overpayments, and where the administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that respondent was credited with medicaid funds, notwithstanding that respondent did not bill these claims to medicaid, the district court erred when it concluded that the ALJ's decision requiring respondent to return fees was not supported by substantial evidence, because the uncontroverted evidence established that respondent was paid with medicaid funds that were not eligible for payment by medicaid, and federal law requires that overpayments of medicaid funds must be returned.Counseling Center, Inc. v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 2018-NMCA-063, cert. denied.",
