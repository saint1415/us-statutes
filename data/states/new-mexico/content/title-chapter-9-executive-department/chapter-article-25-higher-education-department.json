Criteria for consideration should include current income, education and employment status of applicants to the pilot program, and eligibility criteria shall not restrict participants based on immigration status;\n\n(3) develop and administer an economic support program to provide participants with ongoing monetary stipends to enable the participants to acquire training and skills necessary to obtain employment, earn a living wage and, in the process of acquiring that training, to prevent income, housing and food insecurity. The stipends provided pursuant to this paragraph should cover the costs associated with basic living needs, including housing, food and transportation, and the costs associated with enrolling in and attending a workforce training program; and\n\n(4) identify and approve workforce training programs in the following priority industries or fields:\n\n(a) health care, including behavioral health;\n\n(b) early childhood education or care;\n\n(c) natural resources management;\n\n(d) renewable energy;\n\n(e) broadband expansion;\n\n(f) first responders;\n\n(g) construction industries;\n\n(h) aerospace;\n\n(i) biosciences;\n\n(j) cybersecurity;\n\n(k) film and television;\n\n(l) outdoor recreation;\n\n(m) sustainable agriculture;\n\n(n) intelligent manufacturing; and\n\n(o) global trade.\n\nB.
