No provision in a retail installment contract relieving the seller from liability under any legal remedies that the buyer may have against the seller under the contract, or any separate instrument of similar import executed in connection therewith, shall be enforceable.\n\nM. In the event that the seller or the holder of the retail installment contract repossesses a motor vehicle, the buyer shall be responsible and liable for any deficiency in accordance with Section 55-9-608 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 50-15-7, enacted by Laws 1959, ch. 204, § 7; 1973, ch. 243, § 1; 1975, ch. 256, § 1; 1975, ch. 274, § 2; 1977, ch. 272, § 2; 1979, ch. 188, § 1; 1981, ch. 10, § 2; 1989, ch. 266, § 1; 2001, ch. 123, § 3; 2013, ch. 74, § 7.\n\nCross references.— For the allowance of a reasonable attorney fee for the debtor, if prevailing in a civil action pursuant to this section,see39-2-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective March 29, 2013, prohibited the amount for insurance from exceeding the rates filed with the superintendent of insurance; and in Subsection F, in the first sentence, after \"filed with the\", added \"office of superintendent of\" and after \"insurance\", deleted \"division of the public regulation commission\"; in Subsection J, after \"the requirements of\", deleted \"A\" and added \"C\"; and in Subsection M, after \"Section\", deleted \"55-9-504\" and added \"55-9-608\".\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, inserted the language beginning \"and if it is the case\" in Paragraph B(5); and substituted \"insurance division of the public regulation commission\" for \"department of insurance of the state corporation commission\" in Subsection C.\n\nEffect of seller's failure to sign contract and deliver unit.— Where the plaintiffs signed a contract agreeing to buy a mobile home from the defendant, which contract was neither dated nor signed by the latter, paying a down payment toward the purchase price, and shortly after the mobile home arrived from the factory, the plaintiffs went to the defendant's place of business to see it, and either at this point or on a second visit, discovering that it was not as ordered in several particulars, asked for a refund of their down payment under this article, they had a right to rescind the contract and receive a refund of the payments they had made, since the contract was not signed by the seller and the unit was never delivered to the buyers.White v. Singleton, 1975-NMCA-104, 88 N.M. 262, 539 P.2d 1024.\n\nAgreement compromising right to rescission and refund void.— An alleged compromise agreement whereby the plaintiffs who refused to accept the mobile home they ordered allowed the defendant to retain their down payment as a credit on another purchase, where the plaintiffs had a right under Subsection A(3) to rescission and refund, was unenforceable and void, because the effect of the alleged compromise amounted to an attempted waiver of the plaintiffs' rights, in violation of Section 58-19-12 NMSA 1978, and because of the general rule that transactions in violation of a statute prescribing penalties, such as those in Section 58-19-11A NMSA 1978, are void.White v. Singleton, 1975-NMCA-104, 88 N.M. 262, 539 P.2d 1024.\n\nAuthority to collect finance charges.— Persons licensed as sales finance companies are without any specific statutory authority under this article to collect any finance charges; because this could not have been what the legislature intended, one must find, in Section 56-8-11.1 NMSA 1978 (now repealed), the authority to collect finance charges. 1985 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 85-01.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —Construction of statutes regulating form and contents of motor vehicle installment sales contracts, 14 A.L.R.3d 330, 46 A.L.R.

In the event one or more installments are extended, deferred or restated, the holder may compute an extension charge on the amount of the installment payment or payments or part thereof which is extended, for the period of time for which each payment, or part thereof is extended, deferred or restated, at the following rates on contracts originally in the respective classification of motor vehicles set forth in Section 8A of this act:\n\nClass 1Class 2Class 3 and 4\n\n1 percent per month1 1/2 percent per month2 percent per month\n\nSuch extension charges may be computed on the basis of a full month for any fractional month period in excess of ten days.\n\nOPTION 2.
