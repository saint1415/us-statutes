      "text": "The following are hereby declared to be the objects and purposes of this act:\n\nA. there exists among citizens of this state a widespread demand for small loans. The scope and intensity of this demand have been increased progressively by many social and economic forces;\n\nB. the expense of making and collecting small loans, which are usually made on comparatively unsubstantial security to wage earners, salaried employees and other persons of relatively low incomes is necessarily high in relation to the amounts lent;\n\nC. experience has proven that such loans cannot be made profitably except under special permissive laws and that without such laws many legitimate enterprises are excluded from the small loan field; that without laws regulating the making of small loans interest charges are often disguised by the use of complicated and technical subterfuge to evade the usury law; that without regulations, borrowers of small sums are often exploited by charges generally exorbitant in relation to those necessary to conduct a small loan business;\n\nD. it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this statute to bring up to date the law pertaining to small loans; to insure more rigid public regulation and supervision of those engaging in the business of making small loans, and selling insurance in connection therewith; to facilitate the elimination of abuse of borrowers; and to establish a system which will more adequately provide honest and efficient small loan service and stimulate competitive reductions in charges.\n\nThe legislature expressly declares: that the charges which licensee [licensees] may collect under the provisions of this act, while inclusive of pure interest, are recognized as inclusive also of adequate service fees to the licensees.\n\nThe legislature further declares: that the charges established by this act are limiting maximums, fixed after careful study of modernized, adequate and efficiently functioning small loan statutes of other states, which will permit licensees hereunder to meet the expense and loss hazard incident to the making and servicing of small loans, to the end that licensees may be encouraged to establish and maintain supervised and regulated loan agencies, whose competitive operations, while stimulating reductions from maximum allowable charges, will provide legitimate sources of loan credit to a large class of borrowers throughout the state, who cannot otherwise obtain honest and lawful loan accommodations under the general laws of New Mexico governing money, interest and usury.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 48-17-30, enacted by Laws 1955, ch. 128, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was added by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The term \"this act\" means Laws 1955, ch. 128, §§ 1 to 29 that are presently compiled as 58-15-1 to 58-15-3, 58-15-6 to 58-15-13 and 58-15-17 to 58-15-31 NMSA 1978.\n\nGenerally.— Small Loan Act of 1947 (Laws 1947, ch. 174, since repealed) was not rendered invalid under the \"enrolled bill rule\" merely because of a failure of the legislative journals to show that the bill was read publicly in full in each legislative house and properly signed by officers of both houses in open session.Thompson v.

      "text": "A. A person shall not engage in the business of lending in amounts of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less for a loan without first having obtained a license from the director. Nothing contained in this subsection shall restrict or prohibit a licensee under the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 from making loans in any amount under the New Mexico Bank Installment Loan Act of 1959 [Chapter 58, Article 7 NMSA 1978] in accordance with the provisions of Section 58-7-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. Nothing in the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 shall apply to a person making individual advances of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less under a written agreement providing for a total loan or line of credit in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000).\n\nC. A banking corporation, savings and loan association or credit union operating under the laws of the United States or of a state shall be exempt from the licensing requirements of the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955, nor shall that act apply to business transacted by any person under the authority of and as permitted by any such law nor to any bona fide pawnbroking business transacted under a pawnbroker's license nor to bona fide commercial loans made to dealers upon personal property held for resale. Nothing contained in the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 shall be construed as abridging the rights of any of those exempted from the operations of that act from contracting for or receiving interest or charges not in violation of an existing applicable statute of this state.\n\nD. The provisions of Subsection A of this section apply to:\n\n(1) a person who owns an interest, legal or equitable, in the business or profits of a licensee and whose name does not specifically appear on the face of the license, except a stockholder in a corporate licensee;\n\n(2) a person who seeks to evade its application by any device, subterfuge or pretense whatsoever, including but not thereby limiting the generality of the foregoing:\n\n(a) the loan, forbearance, use or sale of credit (as guarantor, surety, endorser, comaker or otherwise), money, goods or things in action;\n\n(b) the use of collateral or related sales or purchases of goods or services or agreements to sell or purchase, whether real or pretended;\n\n(c) receiving or charging compensation for goods or services, whether or not sold, delivered or provided;\n\n(d) the real or pretended negotiation, arrangement or procurement of a loan through any use or activity of a third person, whether real or fictitious;\n\n(e) making loans disguised as a personal property sale and leaseback transaction;\n\n(f) disguising loan proceeds as a cash rebate for the pretextual installment sale of goods or services; and\n\n(g) making, offering, assisting or arranging a debtor to obtain a loan with a greater rate of interest, consideration or charge than is permitted by Chapter 58 NMSA 1978 through any method, including mail, telephone, internet or any electronic means, regardless of whether the person has a physical location in the state; and\n\n(3) if the loan exceeds the rate permitted by Chapter 58 NMSA 1978, a person purporting to act as an agent, service provider or in another capacity for another entity that is exempt from the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955, if, among other things:\n\n(a) the person holds, acquires or maintains, directly or indirectly, the predominant economic interest in the loan;\n\n(b) the person markets, brokers, arranges or facilitates the loan and holds the right, requirement or first right of refusal to purchase loans, receivables or interests in the loans; or\n\n(c) the totality of the circumstances indicate that the person is the lender and the transaction is structured to evade the requirements of the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955. In deciding whether the totality of the circumstances indicate that the person is a lender and a transaction is structured to evade the requirements of the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955, all relevant factors may be considered, including where the person: 1) indemnifies, insures or protects an exempt entity for any costs or risks related to the loan; 2) predominantly designs, controls or operates the loan program; or 3) purports to act as an agent, service provider or in another capacity for an exempt entity while acting directly as a lender in other states.\n\nE. A person, copartnership, trust or a trustee or beneficiary thereof or an association or corporation or a member, officer, director, agent or employee thereof who violates or participates in the violation of a provision of Subsection A of this section is guilty of a petty misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Subsection B of Section 31-19-1 NMSA 1978. A contract or loan in the making or collection of which an act is done that violates Subsection A or D of this section or Section 58-15-17 or 58-15-20 NMSA 1978 is void and the lender has no right to collect, receive or retain any principal, interest or charges whatsoever.\n\nF. A loan in an amount equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less shall be made only pursuant to the New Mexico Bank Installment Loan Act of 1959 or the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955.\n\nG. A violation of a provision of the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 that constitutes either an unfair or deceptive trade practice or an unconscionable trade practice pursuant to Section 57-12-2 NMSA 1978 is actionable pursuant to the Unfair Practices Act.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 48-17-32, enacted by Laws 1955, ch. 128, § 3; 1973, ch. 18, § 1; 1977, ch. 245, § 61; 1983, ch. 95, § 1; 1987, ch. 127, § 1; 1993, ch. 210, § 4; 2007, ch. 86, § 3; 2017, ch. 110, § 12; 2019, ch. 201, § 9; 2022, ch. 23, § 6.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective January 1, 2023, revised certain applicability provisions of the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955; in Subsection A, after \"lending in amounts of\", deleted \"five thousand dollars ($5,000)\" and added \"ten thousand dollars ($10,000)\"; in Subsection B, after \"individual advances of\", deleted \"five thousand dollars ($5,000)\" and added \"ten thousand dollars ($10,000)\", and after \"in excess of\", deleted \"five thousand dollars ($5,000)\" and added \"ten thousand dollars ($10,000)\"; in Subsection D, Paragraph D(2), added Subparagraphs D(2)(e) through D(2)(g), and added Paragraph D(3); and in Subsection F, after \"an amount equal to\", deleted \"five thousand dollars ($5,000)\" and added \"ten thousand dollars ($10,000)\".\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective January 1, 2020, provided penalties for violations of the certain provisions of the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955, and provided that certain violations of the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 are also actionable pursuant to the Unfair Practices Act; in Subsection E, after \"of this section\", added \"or Section 58-15-17 or 58-15-20 NMSA 1978\"; and in Subsection G, after \"1955\", deleted \"which violation consists of a false or misleading oral or written representation of any kind knowingly made in the extension of credit that may, tends to or does deceive or mislead any person to whom the extension of credit is made\" and added \"that\", after \"constitutes\", added \"either\", after \"trade practice\", added \"or an unconscionable trade practice pursuant to Section 57-12-2 NMSA 1978 is actionable\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2019, ch. 201, § 17 provided that the provisions of this act apply to loans subject to the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 and the New Mexico Bank Installment Loan Act of 1959 that are executed on or after January 1, 2020.\n\nThe 2017 amendment,effective January 1, 2018, revised certain criteria requiring persons who are engaged in the business of lending to obtain a license from the director of the financial institutions division of the regulation and licensing department, revised the amount of certain loans that are exempt from the provisions of the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955, provided that loans in the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000) or less shall be made only pursuant to the New Mexico Bank Installment Loan Act of 1959 or the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955, and provided that certain violations of the provisions of the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 constitute unfair or deceptive trade practices pursuant to the Unfair Practices Act; in Subsections A and B, changed \"two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500)\" to \"five thousand dollars ($5,000)\"; and added Subsections F and G.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective November 1, 2007, amended Subsection B to delete the former condition that loan contracts with a line of credit in excess of $2,500 be secured by a pledge of real estate.\n\nSeverability clause.— Laws 2007, ch. 86, § 23 provided that if any part or application of the act is held invalid, the remainder or its application to other situations or persons shall not be affected.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, in Subsection E, substituted the language following \"Subsection A of this section\" in the first sentence for \"is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100) and not more than three hundred dollars ($300) or by imprisonment of not more than ninety days or by both fine and imprisonment\" and made a stylistic change.\n\nGenerally.— Fact that one was licensed as a small loan operator under Laws 1947, ch. 174 (now repealed), did not preclude it from making loans for more than $500, provided it did not charge more than 10% interest per annum.Spain Mgmt. Co. v. Packs' Auto Sales, 1950-NMSC-001, 54 N.M. 64, 213 P.2d 433.\n\nActs constituting \"engaging in the business\" of lending.— Occasional isolated acts of loaning money to accommodate one's customers and friends do not constitute \"engaging in the business\" of loaning money; yet one act can be sufficient to support a finding that one was engaged in business.Hammond v. Reeves, 1976-NMCA-069, 89 N.M. 389, 552 P.2d 1237.\n\nWhere the lender made a relatively small number of loans and had another business from which he presumably obtained the majority of his income, it cannot be said that the trial court erred in the conclusion that he was not engaged in the business of lending.Hammond v. Reeves, 1976-NMCA-069, 89 N.M. 389, 552 P.2d 1237.\n\nBusiness establishments dealing with Indians not exempt.— Business establishments, not specially licensed as pawnbrokers, located outside of Indian reservations which charged in excess of 12% per annum when loaning money or extending credit to Indians are not exempt from the provisions of the Small Loan Act. 1970 Op.

Within thirty days after the entry of such an order, the director shall prepare written findings and shall deliver a copy of the findings to the applicant.

The court in its discretion and upon proper showing may order a temporary extension of the license pending disposition of the review proceedings.\n\nJ. In connection with the determination of fitness and character of an applicant pursuant to the provisions of this section, the fact that the applicant or licensee is a member of or interested financially in, connected or affiliated with, controls or is controlled by or owns or is owned by other corporations, partnerships, trusts, associations or other legal entities engaged in the lending of money whose policies and practices as to rates of interest, charges and fees and general dealing with borrowers are questionable or would constitute violation of the general usury statutes of this state or of the declared purposes and spirit of the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 shall be given such consideration and weight as the director determines.\n\nK. At the time of issuance of original license and each annual renewal thereof, the licensee for each licensed office shall pay to the director as a license fee for the period covered by the license the sum of five hundred dollars ($500) as a minimum, plus an additional seventy-five cents ($.75) for each one thousand dollars ($1,000) or fraction thereof of loans outstanding as of December 31 next preceding, as shown on the applicant's annual report. In the event that the application for annual renewal of the license is delinquent, the licensee shall also pay a delinquency fee of ten dollars ($10.00) per day for each day the licensee is delinquent in filing the application for renewal.\n\nL. In addition to the fees provided for in Subsection K of this section, at the time of issuance of original license and each annual renewal thereof, the licensee for each licensed office shall pay to the director as an additional fee for the period covered by the license the sum of two hundred dollars ($200), which fee shall be deposited into the financial literacy fund.\n\nM. A licensee by accepting a license that is issued or renewed or by continuing to operate a licensed office under the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 shall by such action be deemed to have consented to be bound by the lawful provisions of that act and all lawful requirements, regulations and orders of the director promulgated or issued pursuant to any authorization granted in that act.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 58-15-5, enacted by Laws 1978, ch. 6, § 1; 1987, ch. 292, § 2; 1993, ch. 210, § 5; 2007, ch. 86, § 4; 2017, ch. 110, § 13.\n\nCross references.— For exemption of banks, saving and loan associations, and credit unions from licensing requirement,see58-15-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2017 amendment,effective January 1, 2018, provided for an additional two hundred dollar ($200) annual license fee to be paid by the licensee of each licensed office and to be deposited into the financial literacy fund; and added a new Subsection L and redesignated the succeeding subsection accordingly.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2017, ch. 110, § 26 provided that the provisions of Laws 2017, ch. 110 shall apply to loans subject to the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 and the New Mexico Bank Installment Loan Act of 1959 executed on or after January 1, 2018.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective November 1, 2007, simplifies the language and organization of this section.\n\nSeverability clause.— Laws 2007, ch. 86, § 23 provided that if any part or application of the act is held invalid, the remainder or its application to other situations or persons shall not be affected.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, in Subsection A, deleted language relating to the procedure for application for a license under the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 and made a stylistic change; substituted \"March 31\" for \"May 1\" in Subsection D; added the last sentence to Subsection G; and made stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nCourts not to consider certain matters regarding small loan companies.— Whether small loan companies serve the public interest and, if so, whether experience justifies a restriction on the number licensed may be debatable, but these are not considerations for the courts.S.I.C. Finance-Loans of Menaul, Inc. v. Upton, 1966-NMSC-012, 75 N.M. 780, 411 P.2d 755.\n\nLicense issuance or denial deemed administrative.— The general welfare of the public is the primary concern of the legislature in providing for the regulation and control of small loan businesses, and to that end the issuance or denial of an application for a small loan license is an administrative act and not a judicial function.S.I.C. Finance-Loans of Menaul, Inc. v. Upton, 1966-NMSC-012, 75 N.M. 780, 411 P.2d 755.\n\nPurpose of \"convenience and advantage\" clause.— The \"convenience and advantage\" clause of this section was adopted to make sure that the needs of the community to be served by small loan businesses were not outrun by the number of such establishments at the risk of defeating the beneficent purposes of the Small Loan Act.S.I.C. Finance-Loans of Menaul, Inc. v. Upton, 1966-NMSC-012, 75 N.M. 780, 411 P.2d 755.\n\nOther factors to be consideredin licensing are the needs of the general public in the community as a whole and in the particular area to be served, the number and location of other small loan licensees and the effect upon them and, in turn, on the service and costs to the public of an additional licensee.S.I.C. Finance-Loans of Menaul, Inc. v. Upton, 1966-NMSC-012, 75 N.M. 780, 411 P.2d 755.\n\nFacts justifying denial of license.— Where facts showed that the presently existing small loan licensees were adequately serving the small loan needs of the community; that the general economy of the area was leveling off; that, of the 18 small loan licensees in the city, two were not presently operating, and several showed decreases in loans outstanding; that delinquencies in payments of loans, suits and repossessions showed an increase and that the general indices and criteria measuring factors of economic advancement did not indicate such growth at the present or in the immediate future as would give rise to the conclusion that allowing the applicant to engage in business would promote the convenience and advantage of the community in which the business of the applicant was to be conducted, the denial of a license to open a small loan business was justified.Nationwide Fin. Co. v. State Bank Exm'r, 1966-NMSC-070, 76 N.M. 191, 413 P.2d 471.\n\nDiscretion of director.— Under this section, the examiner or commissioner (now director) is given fact-finding powers, the exercise of which permits certain discretion in determining the conditions in the community where the business is to be conducted.S.I.C. Finance-Loans of Menaul, Inc. v. Upton, 1966-NMSC-012, 75 N.M. 780, 411 P.2d 755.\n\nScope of review in supreme court.— On appeal from an administrative body, the review of the supreme court, like that of the district court, is limited to determining whether the facts found by the commissioner (now director) have substantial support in the evidence, and if so, whether the law was properly applied.S.I.C. Finance-Loans of Menaul, Inc. v. Upton, 1966-NMSC-012, 75 N.M. 780, 411 P.2d 755.\n\nFactors reviewing court to consider.— In determining whether the commissioner's (now director's) findings are supported by substantial evidence and whether the conclusions based thereon are arbitrary and unreasonable, attention should first be directed to the necessity for regulation of small loan businesses and for the inclusion in the majority of small loan acts of the \"convenience and advantage\" clause.S.I.C. Finance-Loans of Menaul, Inc. v. Upton, 1966-NMSC-012, 75 N.M. 780, 411 P.2d 755.\n\nFees.— The financial institutions division may not charge a fee based upon loans made pursuant to the Installment Loan Act. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen.

Therefore, the business cannot continue to operate. This, of course, does not mean that the loans outstanding at the time of death may not be collected at the small loan rate.

The licensee shall pay to the director for such annual examination a fee of two hundred dollars ($200).\n\nB. Within a reasonable time after the completion of an examination of a licensed office, the director shall mail to the licensee a copy of the report of the examination, together with any comments, exceptions, objections or criticisms of the director concerning the conduct of the licensee and the operation of the licensed office.\n\nC. For the purpose of discovering violations of the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 or of securing information lawfully required under that act, the director or the director's authorized representative may at any time investigate the business and examine the books, accounts, papers and records used therein, including income tax returns or other reports filed in the office of the director of the revenue processing division of the taxation and revenue department of:\n\n(1) any licensee;\n\n(2) any other person engaged in the business described in Subsection A of Section 58-15-3 NMSA 1978 or participating in such business as principal, agent, broker or otherwise; and\n\n(3) any person who the director has reasonable cause to believe is violating any provision of the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955, whether the person claims to be within the authority or beyond the scope of that act.\n\nD. For the purposes of this section, a person who advertises, solicits or makes any representation as being willing to make loan transactions in any amount, except persons, financial institutions or lending agencies operating under charters or licenses issued by a state or federal agency or under any special statute, shall be subject to investigation under the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 and shall be presumed to be engaged in the business described in Subsection A of Section 58-15-3 NMSA 1978 as to any loans of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less.\n\nE. To facilitate the examinations and investigations by the director and fully disclose the operations and methods of operation of each licensed office, the licensee shall, in each licensed office, keep on file as part of the records of the office all office manuals, communications or directives containing statements of loan policy to office managers and employees. If the licensee is an individual, corporation, trust or association, the licensee shall keep in at least one office for information of the director a record of the several individuals, firms, beneficiaries of any trust and corporations deriving or receiving any part of the benefits, net income or profits from the operation of the licensee within New Mexico.\n\nF. For the purposes of this section, the director or the director's authorized representative shall have and be given free access to the offices and places of business, files, safes and vaults of all licensees and shall have authority to require the attendance of any person and to examine the person under oath relative to such loans or business or to the subject matter of any examination, investigation or hearing as provided in the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955. Notices to appear before the director for examination under oath may be served by registered mail. If the party notified to appear is the licensee, any person named on the face of the license being investigated or any agent, employee or manager participating in the licensee's business and the party fails to appear for examination or refuses to answer questions submitted, the director may, forthwith and without further notice to the licensee, suspend the license involved pending compliance with the notice. Upon failure of any other person to appear or to answer questions, the director may apply to and invoke the aid of any district court of New Mexico in compelling the attendance and testimony of any such person and the production of books, records, written instruments and documents relating to the business of the licensee. The district court whose aid is so invoked by the director may, in case of contumacy or refusal to obey any order of the district court issued to compel the attendance of the person or the production of books, records, written instruments and documents, punish the person as for contempt of court.\n\nG. The director shall prescribe rules of procedure for all hearings, examinations or investigations provided for in the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955. The director is not bound by the usual common law or statutory rules of evidence or by any technical or formal rules of procedure or pleading and specification of charges other than as specifically provided in the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 but may conduct hearings, examinations and investigations in the manner best calculated to ascertain the substantial rights of the parties interested.\n\nH. The director has the power to administer oaths, certify official acts and records of the director's office, issue subpoenas for witnesses in the name of and under the seal of the director's office and compel the production of papers, books, accounts and documents. The director shall issue subpoenas at the instance of any party to a hearing before the division upon payment of a fee of two dollars fifty cents ($2.50) for each subpoena so issued.\n\nI. Depositions may be taken with or without a commission, and written interrogatories may be submitted in the same manner and on the same grounds provided by law for the taking of depositions or submission of written interrogatories in civil actions pending in the district courts of this state.\n\nJ. Each witness who appears before the director by the director's order shall receive the fees and mileage provided for witnesses in civil actions in the district court. Fees and mileage shall be paid by the state, but no witness subpoenaed at the instance of parties other than the director is entitled to compensation from the state for attendance or mileage unless the director certifies that the witness' testimony is material.\n\nK. Whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe that a person is violating a provision of the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955, the director may, in addition to all actions provided for in that act and without prejudice thereto, enter an order requiring the person to desist or to refrain from the violation. An action may be brought on the relation of the attorney general and the director to enjoin the person from engaging in or continuing the violation or from doing any act in furtherance of the violation. In any such action, an order or judgment may be entered awarding a preliminary or final injunction as may be deemed proper. In addition to all other means provided by law for the enforcement of a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction or final injunction, the court in which such action is brought shall have power and jurisdiction to impound and to appoint a receiver for the property and business of the defendants, including books, papers, documents and records pertaining thereto or so much thereof as the court may deem reasonably necessary to prevent further violations of the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 through or by means of the use of the property and business.

The financing statements required to be filed under the Uniform Commercial Code are, in effect, mortgages because they create a lien on the property pledged. Concluding, then, that financing statements are tantamount to mortgages, a release of such a lien must be filed whenever a note is paid in full, as provided for in Subsection A(3) of this section. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-50 (overruled 1970 Op. Att'y Gen.
