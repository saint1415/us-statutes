No association subject to the provisions of the Savings and Loan Act shall obtain insurance of accounts from, or represent in any way that its accounts are insured by, any insurer other than the federal savings and loan insurance corporation or other federal agency or a state agency unless the supervisor, upon application to him by the association and after reasonable notice and public hearing by the supervisor, issues his certificate approving the application after determining that:\n\n(a) the contract of insurance contemplated is written upon substantially the same basis as to form, amount, coverage, maturity, voluntary and involuntary termination and other provisions as the insurance contract provided by the federal savings and loan insurance corporation, and complies with any further requirements for protection the supervisor deems reasonably necessary; and\n\n(b) the contract is underwritten by an insurer having a net worth reasonably commensurate with the risks underwritten, but not less than twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000), which is licensed in this state and authorized to do business in this state, and which is admitted and authorized by law to write such insurance in all of the states of the United States.\n\nThe requirements of this paragraph apply to all revisions or modifications of such contracts of insurance. Associations and foreign associations insured as provided in this paragraph may make representations as to insurance of savings accounts, but all representations shall set forth the name of the insurer. Except for banks, no association or foreign association or other person shall advertise or represent or accept or offer to accept any savings accounts in this state as insured or guaranteed accounts, or as the savings accounts of an insured or guaranteed institution, unless they are insured as provided in this paragraph. Any person who violates any provision of this paragraph is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000). Each day of any violation is a separate offense, and shall be enjoined upon application to the district court by the attorney general, the supervisor, the district attorney or by any association in this state. The requirements of this paragraph are in the exercise of the police power of this state and are enacted to protect the people of the state from misrepresentation, misunderstanding and from loss.\n\nB. If the supervisor so finds, he shall state his findings in writing, endorse his approval on the articles of incorporation, issue under his official seal a certificate of authority for the association to transact business, deliver copies of the approved articles of incorporation and bylaws to the incorporators and to the state corporation commission [public regulation commission] and retain a copy as a permanent file of his office. Upon acceptance and approval by the state corporation commission [public regulation commission] of the articles of incorporation, the proposed association is a corporate body with perpetual existence unless terminated by law, and it may exercise the powers of an association as set forth in the Savings and Loan Act. Before actually transacting any savings and loan business, the association shall file with the supervisor satisfactory proof that insurance of accounts has been obtained.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 48-15-56, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 61, § 12.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nLaws 1998, ch. 108, § 80 provided that references to the state corporation commission be construed as references to the public regulation commission.\n\nCross references.— For meaning of \"supervisor\",see58-10-2J NMSA 1978.\n\nCharter authorizes operation only of described institution.— When a charter is actually issued, it has been held to constitute authority to operate only that institution which it describes. 1981 Op.

The association shall first file an application with the supervisor, accompanied by an investigation fee of five hundred dollars ($500). The supervisor shall conduct a hearing on the application after giving the same notice as provided for in Section 58-10-11 NMSA 1978. Opportunity shall be offered any interested person to present evidence and argument. After hearing, the supervisor shall, in his discretion, grant or deny the application in writing. In exercising his discretion, the supervisor shall take into account, but not by way of limitation, such factors as the financial history and conditions of the applicant association, the adequacy of its capital structure, its future earning prospects and the general character of its management. Approval shall not be given until he is satisfied that:\n\n(1) establishment of the branch will meet the needs and promote the convenience and advantage of the community in which the business of the branch is to be conducted; and\n\n(2) the probable volume of business and reasonable public demand in the community are sufficient to assure and maintain the solvency of the branch and of the existing association or associations in the community.\n\nB. Branches of a parent association authorized under the Savings and Loan Act shall be opened for business within six months after the authorization has been issued or extended by the supervisor, or the authorization is void. Branches shall be operated as branches of, and under the name of, the parent association, and be under the control and discretion of the board of directors and executive officers of the parent association.\n\nC. Except as provided in Subsection D of this section, branches of a parent association authorized under the Savings and Loan Act may do business the same as the parent association but branches must be located within a radius of one hundred statute air miles from the principal office of the parent association within the state of New Mexico. The provisions of this subsection are not retroactive with respect to branches established or approved by the director of the financial institutions division prior to the effective date of the Savings and Loan Act.\n\nD. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection C of this section, upon the United States or any agency thereof changing the restrictions on branch offices of federally chartered savings and loan associations which have their principal office in the state, the director of the financial institutions division of the commerce and industry department [regulation and licensing department] may promulgate regulations embodying restrictions for state-chartered savings and loan associations, which restrictions are substantially similar to those then applying to federally chartered savings and loan associations.\n\nE. As used in this section, \"branch\" includes any additional house, office or place of business at which deposits are received and money lent except where the additional house, office or place of business is connected with the main association business premises by underground or overhead passageways, in which case it shall not be considered as a branch.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 48-15-61, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 61, § 17; 1973, ch. 189, § 2; 1977, ch. 38, § 1; 1977, ch. 245, § 42; 1977, ch. 329, § 1; 1978, ch. 8, § 1; 1979, ch. 198, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nSee58-1-32 NMSA 1978 and notes thereto.\n\nCross references.— For meaning of \"supervisor\",see58-10-2J NMSA 1978.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 1967, ch. 61, § 101 made the Savings and Loan Act effective July 1, 1967.\n\nHearing requirement does not apply to transfer of existing branches.— Subsection A applies only to an application for a new branch and the purpose of the hearing requirements is to have evidence presented that the factors and standards described in the statute can or cannot be met. Therefore, the hearing requirement of Subsection A does not apply to the transfer of existing branches from one savings and loan association to another.Equitable Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Davidson, 1973-NMSC-100, 85 N.M. 621, 515 P.2d 140.\n\n\"Grandfather clause\" branch offices transferred without meeting section's requirements.— Branch offices established under the \"grandfather clause\" of former Subsection D (present Subsection C) can be transferred without the requirement of notice and hearing, and without meeting the required conditions necessary for the establishment of a new branch office.Equitable Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Davidson, 1973-NMSC-100, 85 N.M. 621, 515 P.2d 140.\n\nAssertion of undue competitive injury by proposed branch gives standing.— To attain standing in a suit arguing the unlawfulness of governmental action, the complainant must allege that he is injured in fact or is imminently threatened with injury, economically or otherwise. Appellants had standing to seek review of the supervisor's order as associations \"aggrieved and directly affected\" by it where they asserted they would suffer from undue competitive injury if another branch was permitted in Santa Fe, and that another branch would not be to the advantage of the community; the protection of these interests is explicitly recognized in Subsection A.De Vargas Sav. & Loan Ass'n v.

The association may pay in full each withdrawal request as presented without requiring that written application be made. When an association is unable to pay all withdrawal requests within a period of thirty days from the date of receipt of written request, the association shall number and file all withdrawal requests in the order received and proceed in the following manner while any withdrawal request remains unpaid for more than thirty days:\n\n(1) withdrawal requests shall be paid in the order received and, if any holder of a savings account or accounts has requested the withdrawal of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), he shall be paid one thousand dollars ($1,000) in order when reached and his withdrawal request shall be charged with that amount as paid and shall be renumbered and placed at the end of the list of withdrawal requests, and thereafter, upon again being reached, shall be paid a like amount but not exceeding the withdrawal value of his savings account, and until the withdrawal request has been paid in full shall continue to be so paid, renumbered and replaced at the end of the withdrawal requests on file. When any such request is reached for payment, the association shall advise the holder of the savings account by certified mail to his last address of record on the books of the association and, unless the holder applies in person or in writing for the payment of the withdrawal request within thirty days from the date of the mailing of the notice, no payment on account of the withdrawal request shall be made and the request shall be cancelled. The board of directors may pay on an equitable basis an amount not exceeding two hundred dollars ($200) to any holder of a savings account or accounts in any calendar month without regard to any other provision of this section.\n\n(2) when an association is unable to pay all withdrawal requests within a period not exceeding thirty days from the date of receipt of written request, it shall allot to the payment of such requests the remainder of the association's receipts from all sources after deducting from total receipts appropriate amounts for expenses, required payments on indebtedness, earnings distributable in cash to holders of savings accounts and a fund for general corporate purposes equivalent to not more than twenty percent of the association's receipts from holders of its savings accounts and from its borrowers.\n\nB.

The opening of the account in such form is, in the absence of fraud or undue influence, conclusive evidence in any action to which either the association or the surviving party or parties is a party of the intention of all of the parties to the account to vest title to the account and the additions thereto in the survivor or survivors. By written instructions given to the institution by all the parties to the account, the signature of more than one of the persons during their lifetimes or of more than one of the survivors after the death of any one of them may be required on any check, receipt or withdrawal order, in which case the institution shall pay the money in the account only in accordance with the instructions, but no such instructions shall limit the right of the survivor or survivors to receive the money in the account. Payment of all or any money in the account as provided in this subsection discharges the institution from liability with respect to the money paid prior to receipt by the institution of written notice from any one of them directing the institution not to permit withdrawals in accordance with the terms of the account or the instructions. After receipt of such notice, an institution may refuse, without liability, to honor any check, receipt or withdrawal order on the account pending determination of the rights of the parties.

The receiver, upon appointment by the court, shall immediately take charge of the affairs of the association, subject to direction of the court, and proceed to conduct the business of the association or to take steps as necessary to conserve the assets and protect the rights of the creditors of the association and its members as may be ordered by the court. If the association is insured by the federal savings and loan insurance corporation, the corporation may be tendered appointment as receiver or coreceiver. If it accepts the appointment, it may nevertheless make loans on the security of, or purchase at public or private sale, any part or all of the assets of the association of which it is receiver or coreceiver if the loan or purchase is approved by the court.
