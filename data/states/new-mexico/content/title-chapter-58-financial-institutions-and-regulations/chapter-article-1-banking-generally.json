As used in this subsection, \"improved farm land\" means any land used for crop or livestock production. A state bank may make real estate loans secured by liens upon unimproved real estate, upon improved real estate, including improved farmland and improved business and residential properties, and upon real estate to be improved by a building to be constructed or in the process of construction in an amount that when added to the amount unpaid upon prior mortgages, liens and encumbrances, if any, upon the real estate does not exceed the respective proportions of appraised value as provided in this section. A loan secured by real estate within the meaning of this section shall be in the form of an obligation secured by a mortgage, trust deed or other instrument, which shall constitute a lien on real estate in fee or under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the director, on a leasehold under a lease that does not expire for at least ten years beyond the maturity date of both and a state bank may purchase or sell obligations so secured in whole or in part. The amount of any such loan made shall not exceed sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the appraised value if the real estate is unimproved; eighty percent of the appraised value if the real estate is improved farmland or is improved by off-site improvements such as streets, water, sewers or other utilities; seventy-five percent of the appraised value if the real estate is in the process of being improved by a building to be constructed or in the process of construction; or ninety percent of the appraised value if the real estate is improved by a building. If any such loan exceeds sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the appraised value of the real estate or if the real estate is improved with a one- to four-family dwelling, installment payments shall be required that are sufficient to amortize the entire principal of the loan within a period of not more than thirty years. However:\n\n(1) the limitations and restrictions set forth in this subsection shall not prevent the renewal or extension of loans and shall not apply to real estate loans that are guaranteed or insured by the United States or an agency thereof or by a state or agency or instrumentality thereof; and\n\n(2) loans that are guaranteed or insured as described in Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of real estate loans that a state bank may make in relation to its capital and surplus or its time and savings deposits or in determining the amount of real estate loans secured by other than first liens. Where the collateral for a loan consists partly of real estate and partly of other security, only the amount by which the loan exceeds the value as collateral of such other security shall be considered a loan upon the security of real estate. In no event shall a loan be considered as a real estate loan where there is a valid and binding agreement that is entered into by a financially responsible lender or other party directly with the bank that is either for the benefit of or has been assigned to the bank and pursuant to which agreement the lender or other party is required to advance to the bank within sixty months from the date of the making of the loan the full amount of the loan to be made by the bank upon the security of real estate. The amount unpaid upon any real estate loan secured by other than a first lien, when added to the amount unpaid upon prior mortgages, liens and encumbrances, shall not exceed in an aggregate sum twenty percent of the amount of the capital stock of the bank paid in and unimpaired plus twenty percent of the amount of its unimpaired surplus fund.\n\nD. A state bank may make real estate loans secured by liens upon forest tracts that are properly managed in all respects. The loans shall be in the form of an obligation secured by mortgage, trust deed or other such instrument, and a state bank may purchase or sell obligations so secured in whole or in part. The amount of any such loan, when added to the amount unpaid upon prior mortgages, liens and encumbrances, if any, shall not exceed sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the appraised fair market value of the growing timber, lands and improvements thereon offered as security. The loan shall be made upon such terms and conditions as to assure that at no time shall the loan balance, when added to the amount unpaid upon prior mortgages, liens and encumbrances, if any, exceed sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the original appraised total value of the property then remaining. No such loan shall be made for a longer term than three years, except that a loan may be made for a term not longer than fifteen years if the loan is secured by an amortized mortgage, deed of trust or other such instrument under the terms of which the installment payments are sufficient to amortize the principal of the loan within a period of not more than fifteen years and at a rate of at least six and two-thirds percent per year. All such loans secured by liens upon forest tracts shall be included in the permissible aggregate of all real estate loans and, when secured by other than first liens, in the permissible aggregate of all real estate loans secured by other than first liens prescribed in Paragraph (2) of Subsection C of this section, but no state bank shall make forest tract loans in an aggregate sum in excess of fifty percent of its capital stock paid in and unimpaired plus fifty percent of its unimpaired surplus fund.\n\nE. Loans made to finance the construction of a building and having maturities of not to exceed sixty months where there is a valid and binding agreement entered into by a financially responsible lender or other party to advance the full amount of the bank's loan upon completion of the building and loans made to finance the construction of residential or farm buildings and having maturities of not to exceed forty-two months may be considered as real estate loans if the loans qualify under this section, or such loans may be classed as commercial loans whether or not secured by a mortgage or similar lien on the real estate upon which the building is being constructed, at the option of each state bank that may have an interest in the loan. No state bank shall invest in or be liable on any such loans classed as commercial loans under this subsection in an aggregate amount in excess of one hundred percent of its actually paid-in and unimpaired capital plus one hundred percent of its unimpaired surplus fund.\n\nF. Notes representing loans made pursuant to provisions of this section to finance the construction of residential or farm buildings and having maturities of not to exceed nine months shall be eligible for discount as commercial paper if accompanied by a valid and binding agreement to advance the full amount of the loan upon the completion of the building, entered into by an individual, partnership, association or corporation acceptable to the discounting bank.\n\nG. Loans made to any borrower where the bank looks for repayment by relying primarily on the borrower's general credit standing and forecast of income, with or without other security, or loans secured by an assignment of rents under a lease and where the bank wishes to take a mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument upon real estate, whether or not constituting a first lien, as a precaution against contingencies and loans in which the small business administration cooperates through agreements to participate in an immediate or deferred or guaranteed basis under the federal Small Business Act shall not be considered as real estate loans within the meaning of this section but shall be classed as commercial loans.\n\nH. A state bank may make loans upon the security of real estate that do not comply with the limitations and restrictions in this section if the total unpaid amount loaned, exclusive of loans that subsequently comply with those limitations and restrictions, does not exceed five percent of the amount that a state bank may invest in real estate loans. The total unpaid amount so loaned shall be included in the aggregate sum that the bank may invest in real estate loans.\n\nI. A loan made by a state bank as a noncomplying loan pursuant to Subsection H of this section may be evidenced by a debt instrument and a security instrument consisting of a mortgage, deed of trust or similar instrument that contain [contains] the following provisions:\n\n(1) either fixed rate or adjustable rate interest accrual on the debt;\n\n(2) an authorization for the borrower to make unscheduled payments to reduce the principal amount of the loan without relieving the borrower from continuing to make payments of installments in the amounts specified in the original debt and security instruments;\n\n(3) the frequency of unscheduled payments shall not exceed the frequency of scheduled payments; and\n\n(4) authorization for the borrower to retrieve by withdrawal part or all of the amount of an unscheduled payment previously made.\n\nJ.

A state bank authorized to exercise trust powers shall not accept or voluntarily relinquish a fiduciary account without the approval or ratification of the board of directors or of a committee of officers or directors designated by the board to perform this function, but the board or the committee may prescribe general rules governing acceptance or relinquishment of fiduciary accounts, and action taken by an officer in accordance with these rules is sufficient approval. Any committee so designated shall keep minutes of its meetings and report at each monthly meeting of the board all action taken since the previous meeting of the board. The board shall designate one or more committees of not less than three qualified officers or directors to supervise the investment of fiduciary funds. No such investment shall be made, retained or disposed of without the approval of a committee. At least once in every calendar year at intervals of not more than fifteen months, the committee shall review all the assets of each fiduciary account and shall determine their current value, safety and suitability and whether the investments should be modified or retained. The committee shall keep minutes of its meetings and shall report at each monthly meeting of the board its conclusions on all questions considered and all action taken since the previous meeting of the board.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 48-22-54, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 305, § 54; 1975, ch. 330, § 36; 1981, ch. 196, § 1; 1995, ch. 190, § 11.\n\nCross references.— For meaning of director of the division,see58-1-3, 9-16-4 and 9-16-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, substituted \"each calendar quarter\" for \"every month\" at the end of the first sentence, added the second sentence, substituted \"board member\" for \"director\" in the third sentence, substituted \"quarterly\" for \"monthly\" in the introductory paragraph of Subsection B; in Paragraph (2) of Subsection B, substituted \"that exceeds the amount specified in Paragraph (1) of this subsection\" for \"which exceed this amount\", \"three\" for \"two\" and made minor stylistic changes; and substituted \"director of the division\" for \"director of the financial institutions division\" and \"board\" for \"board of directors\" throughout the section.\n\nAm.

The director may take possession of a state bank if, after a hearing or bank stipulation, he finds:\n\n(1) its capital is impaired or it is otherwise in an unsound condition;\n\n(2) its business is being conducted in an unlawful or unsound manner;\n\n(3) it is unable to continue normal operations; or\n\n(4) its examination has been obstructed or impeded.\n\nB. The director shall take possession by posting upon the premises a notice reciting that he is assuming possession pursuant to the Banking Act and the time, not earlier than the posting of the notice, when his possession shall be deemed to commence. A copy of the notice shall be filed in the district court in the county in which the main office is located. The director shall notify the federal reserve bank of the district of his taking possession of any state bank which is a member of the federal reserve system.\n\nC. When the director has taken possession of a state bank, he is vested with the full and exclusive power of management and control, including the power to continue or to discontinue the business, to stop or to limit the payment of its obligations, to employ any necessary assistants, to execute any instrument in the name of the bank, to commence, defend and conduct in its name any action or proceeding in which it may be a party, to terminate his possession by restoring the bank to its board of directors and to reorganize or liquidate the bank in accordance with the Banking Act. As soon as practicable after taking possession, the director shall make an inventory of the assets and file a copy of the inventory with the court in which the notice of possession was filed.\n\nD. When the director has taken possession, there shall be a postponement until six months after the commencement of his possession of the date upon which any period of limitation fixed by a statute or agreement would otherwise expire on a claim or right of action of the bank, or upon which an appeal must be taken or a pleading or other document must be filed by the bank in any pending action or proceeding.\n\nE. Within thirty days after the director has taken possession, any interested party may file an application for an injunction with the district court of the county in which the principal office of that bank is located for an order vacating the possession.\n\nF. If the director decides to liquidate the state bank, he shall give what he deems to be adequate notice to the directors, stockholders, depositors and creditors. Any objection to the liquidation shall be filed with the director within ten days after the notice. The director shall proceed to liquidate the institution unless he finds the action unnecessary to protect depositors.\n\nG. If the director decides to reorganize the state bank, after according a hearing to all interested parties he shall enter an order proposing a reorganization plan. A copy of the plan shall be sent to each depositor and creditor who will not receive payment of his claim in full under the plan, together with notice that unless the plan is disapproved within fifteen days in writing by persons holding one-third or more of the aggregate amount of such claims, the director will proceed to effect the reorganization. A department, agency or political subdivision of this state holding a claim which will not be paid in full is authorized to participate as any other creditor.\n\nH. No judgment, lien or attachment shall be executed upon any asset of the state bank while it is in the possession of the director. Upon the election of the director to liquidate or reorganize:\n\n(1) any lien or attachment, other than an attorney's or mechanic's lien, obtained upon any asset of the state bank during the director's possession or within four months prior to commencement thereof shall be vacated, except liens created by the director while in possession; and\n\n(2) any transfer of an asset of the state bank made after or in contemplation of its insolvency with intent to effect a preference shall be voided.\n\nI. The director may borrow money in the name of the state bank and may pledge its assets as security for the loan.\n\nJ. All necessary and reasonable expenses of the director's possession of a state bank and of its reorganization or liquidation shall be defrayed from the assets thereof.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 48-22-61, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 305, § 61; 1991, ch. 120, § 6.\n\nCross references.— For state funds in insolvent banks, see 6-10-48, 6-10-49 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, substituted \"director\" for \"commissioner\" in the section heading and throughout the section; inserted \"or bank stipulation\" near the beginning of Subsection A; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\n\"Insolvent bank\" defined.— Formerly, it was held that an insolvent bank is one which the state bank inspector believes cannot resume business or liquidate its indebtedness to the satisfaction of all its creditors.Maddison v. Bryan, 1926-NMSC-007, 31 N.M. 404, 247 P. 275.\n\nInsolvent bank's loss of power.— By Laws 1915, ch. 67, § 87, an insolvent bank is ousted of its power \"to collect all debts, dues, claims and demands.\"Cooper v. Manning, 1934-NMSC-008, 39 N.M. 206, 43 P.2d 1055.\n\nDirections in decree appointing receiver.— Banks, unlike other corporations, are always subject to the supervisory and visitorial powers of the state. If thought to be in an insolvent condition, it must immediately suspend business. By operation of statute, it is ousted of the possession of all its property and assets, and the court assumes charge and appoints a receiver. Thus, under former law, it was held that it is consequently immaterial that a decree appointing a receiver does not also give full directions for the winding up of the business.Cooper v. Manning, 1934-NMSC-008, 39 N.M. 206, 43 P.2d 1055.\n\nReceiver vested with title.— Laws 1915, ch. 67 (now repealed), construed with former 51-8-6, 1953 Comp., vested title in a bank receiver with the powers enumerated in former 51-8-4, 1953 Comp.State v. Peoples Sav. Bank & Trust Co., 1917-NMSC-060, 23 N.M. 282, 168 P. 526.\n\nConstruction of decree to wind up bank.— In a statutory proceeding to wind up an insolvent bank, it was held formerly that a decree which was inaccurately worded should not be subjected to a fine analysis, but should be taken with the purpose of the statute in view.Cooper v. Manning, 1935-NMSC-038, 39 N.M. 206, 43 P.2d 1055.\n\nExaminer's right to possession enforceable in court.— Since by Laws 1915, ch. 67, § 87, the state bank examiner, during the period he is in possession of a bank, has the power to collect all obligations due the bank, it was held under former law that it may be inferred that the courts are open to him to effectuate this power, and that § 80 of such act contemplates him as a proper party to assert his right to retain possession of a bank.Cooper v. Otero, 1934-NMSC-008, 38 N.M. 164, 29 P.2d 341.\n\nExaminer's right to retain possession.— Formerly, it was held that the bank examiner is a proper party to assert his right to retain possession of a bank, and the attorney general may represent him in court.Cooper v.

A lessor who receives sixty days notice of the commissioner's [director's] election to terminate the lease shall have no claim for rent other than rent accrued to the date of termination nor for damages for such termination.\n\nC. As soon after the commencement of liquidation as practicable, the commissioner [director] shall take the necessary steps to terminate all fiduciary positions held by the state bank and take such action as may be necessary to surrender all property held by the bank as a fiduciary and to settle its fiduciary accounts.\n\nD. The right of any agency of the United States insuring deposits to be subrogated to the rights of the depositors upon payment of their claim shall not be less extensive than the law of the United States requires as a condition of the authority to issue such insurance or make such payment.\n\nE. As soon after the commencement of liquidation as practicable the commissioner [director] shall:\n\n(1) send by mail, to the address shown on the books of the institution, a notice of the liquidation to each known depositor, creditor, lessee of a safe deposit box, bailor of property held by the bank or person interested in funds held as fiduciary by the bank;\n\n(2) include with the liquidation notices sent by mail:\n\n(a) to all depositors or creditors, a statement of the amount shown on the books of the institution to be due the depositor or creditor and that if the amount claimed differs from that stated, a claim must be filed with the commissioner [director] before a specified date, not earlier than sixty days nor later than ninety days thereafter, in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the notice;\n\n(b) to all bailors or lessees of safe deposit boxes, a demand that property held by the bank as bailee or in safe deposit boxes be withdrawn within thirty days by the person entitled thereto; and\n\n(c) to all persons interested in funds held as a fiduciary, a statement that the commissioner [director] is going to take action to resign the fiduciary position and take action to settle the fiduciary accounts;\n\n(3) publish the notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the community once a week for three successive weeks;\n\n(4) open all safe deposit boxes from which the contents have not been removed within thirty days after demand, deal with the contents in the manner provided for boxes upon which the payment of rental is in default, and hold the sealed packages containing the contents, together with the certified inventories for one year, unless sooner claimed by the person entitled thereto, then sell or otherwise dispose of the property and transfer the proceeds of any sale or disposition to the state treasurer as abandoned funds;\n\n(5) hold all unclaimed property held by the bank as bailee together with a certified inventory of the property for a year, unless sooner claimed by the person entitled thereto, then sell or otherwise dispose of the property, and transfer the proceeds of any sale or disposition to the state treasurer as abandoned funds.\n\nF. Within six months after the last day specified in the notice for the filing of claims, or a longer period allowed by the court in which the notice of possession was filed, the commissioner [director] shall:\n\n(1) reject any claim if he doubts the validity thereof;\n\n(2) determine the amount, if any, owing to each known creditor or depositor and the priority class of his claim under the Banking Act;\n\n(3) prepare a schedule of his determinations for filing in the court in which notice of possession was filed;\n\n(4) notify each person whose claim has not been allowed in full, and publish once a week for three successive weeks a notice of the time when and the place where the schedule of determinations will be available for inspection and the date, not sooner than thirty days thereafter, when the commissioner [director] will file his schedule in court.\n\nG. Within twenty days after the filing of the commissioner's [director's] schedule, any creditor, depositor or stockholder may file an objection to any determination made. Any objections so filed shall be heard and determined by the court, upon such notice to the commissioner [director] and interested claimants as the court may prescribe. If the objection is sustained, the court shall direct an appropriate modification of the schedule. After filing his schedule, the commissioner [director] may, from time to time, make partial distribution to the holders of claims which are undisputed or have been allowed by the court, if a proper reserve is established for the payment of disputed claims. As soon as is practicable after the determination of all objections, the commissioner [director] shall make final distribution.\n\nH. The following claims shall have priority in the order named:\n\n(1) obligations incurred by the commissioner [director];\n\n(2) wages and salaries of officers and employees earned during the three-month period preceding the commissioner's [director's] possession in an amount not exceeding six hundred dollars ($600) a month for any one person;\n\n(3) fees and assessments due to the department [financial institutions division]; and\n\n(4) deposits to the extent of one hundred dollars ($100) for each depositor.\n\nI. After the payment of all other claims with interest at the maximum rate permitted on time deposits, the commissioner [director] shall pay claims otherwise proper which were not filed within the time prescribed. If the sum available for any class is insufficient to provide payment in full, such sum shall be distributed to the claimants in the class pro rata.\n\nJ. Any assets remaining after all claims have been paid shall be distributed to the stockholders in accordance with their respective interests.\n\nK. Unclaimed funds remaining after completion of the liquidation shall be retained for five years by the commissioner [director] unless sooner claimed by the owner. At the expiration of such period, the remaining sum shall be transferred to the state treasurer as abandoned funds.\n\nL. When the assets have been distributed in accordance with the Banking Act, the commissioner [director] shall file an account with the court. Upon approval of the report, the commissioner [director] shall be relieved of liability in connection with the liquidation and the charter shall be cancelled.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 48-22-63, enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 305, § 63.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995),see7-8A-30 NMSA 1978.\n\nPurpose of article.— Laws 1915, ch. 67, § 86, was passed to obviate the cumbersome and expensive method formerly prevailing, under which creditors and not the receiver enforced the stockholders' liability.Melaven v. Schmidt, 1929-NMSC-100, 34 N.M. 443, 283 P. 900;Clapp v. Smith, 1916-NMSC-048, 22 N.M. 153, 159 P. 523;Maddison v. Bryan, 1926-NMSC-007, 31 N.M. 404, 247 P. 275.\n\nLaws 1933, ch. 32, § 1, is not a mandatory statuterequiring the judicial department to appoint the state bank examiner receiver of an insolvent bank, or providing that no receiver shall be appointed by the court except upon application of the attorney general.Cooper v. Otero, 1934-NMSC-008, 38 N.M. 164, 29 P.2d 341 (decided under former law).\n\nStatute is only a recommendation to the judiciary.— Formerly, it was held that the provision of Laws 1933, ch. 32, § 1, that the court \"shall appoint the state bank examiner as such receiver\" amounts to no more in an equity proceeding than a recommendation to the judiciary to appoint him; otherwise the enactment would violate N.M. Const., art. VI, § 13.Cooper v. Otero, 1934-NMSC-008, 38 N.M. 164, 29 P.2d 341.\n\nCourt aid to wind up affairs.— Under former law, it was held that no state officer has authority to wind up the affairs of an insolvent bank without the aid of a court.Cooper v. Otero, 1934-NMSC-008, 38 N.M. 164, 29 P.2d 341.\n\nJudge with discretion as to receiver appointment.— The district judge to whom application for appointment of receiver for insolvent bank was made under Laws 1921, ch. 134, was not bound to appoint the state bank examiner receiver, but could exercise discretion and appoint another as held under former law.State ex rel. Read v. Ryan, 1922-NMSC-011, 27 N.M. 651, 204 P. 68.\n\nOfficer's power of possession only preliminary to court action.— In this state, under former law, it was held that power conferred upon the state banking officer to take possession of a state bank is only preliminary to court action, in order to give the state officer more than temporary standing.Cooper v. Otero, 1934-NMSC-008, 38 N.M. 164, 29 P.2d 341.\n\nReceiver of insolvent bank is not representative of creditorswith power to institute a suit for the recovery of the added liability of stockholders as was formerly held.Clapp v. Smith, 1916-NMSC-048, 22 N.M. 153, 159 P. 523.\n\nStockholders' liability enforceable by receiver.— Under Laws 1915, ch. 67, § 86, it was formerly held that statutory liability of stockholders of a bank which has failed is an asset in the hands of the receiver, who may enforce it in the course of liquidation without awaiting final determination of fact or amount of deficiency of assets.Maddison v. Bryan, 1926-NMSC-007, 31 N.M. 404, 247 P. 275.\n\nPerson maintaining suit.— Laws 1933, ch. 32, § 1, contains no direction as to the name of the person in whose name the suit shall be maintained.Cooper v. Otero, 1934-NMSC-008, 38 N.M. 164, 29 P.2d 341.\n\nWinding up decree to be liberally construed.— It was held under former law that in a statutory proceeding to wind up an insolvent bank, a decree which was inaccurately worded should not be subjected to a fine analysis, but should be taken with the purpose of the statute in view.Cooper v. Manning, 1935-NMSC-038, 39 N.M. 206, 43 P.2d 1055.\n\nDistribution of assets of insolvent state bankis governed by general incorporation laws.State v. Bank of Magdalena, 1928-NMSC-048, 33 N.M. 473, 270 P. 881, distinguished,State v. State Bank, 1934-NMSC-046, 38 N.M. 338, 32 P.2d 1017 (decided under former law).\n\nPreferences and setoffs are governed by the general incorporation lawsfor the winding up of insolvent corporations.State v. Bank of Magdalena, 1928-NMSC-048, 33 N.M. 473, 270 P. 881, distinguished,State v. State Bank, 1934-NMSC-046, 38 N.M. 338, 32 P.2d 1017 (decided under former law).\n\nState preference lost after receiver appointed.— It was held under former law that where a receiver has been appointed for an insolvent state bank, the state is not entitled to a preference over other creditors, as to money on deposit at the time the receiver was appointed.State v. First State Bank, 1917-NMSC-047, 22 N.M. 661, 167 P. 3, 1918A L.R.A. 394, distinguished,State v. People's Sav. Bank & Trust Co., 1917-NMSC-060, 23 N.M. 282, 168 P. 526.\n\nDeposits of the state in an insolvent bank lose priority of payment when the assets of such bank are turned over to the hands of a receiver.State v. People's Sav. Bank & Trust Co., 1917-NMSC-060, 23 N.M. 282, 168 P. 526 (decided under former law).\n\nSubsequent purchaser cannot engage in savings and loan business when association liquidated.— When the assets of a savings and loan association are liquidated by a receiver pursuant to an order of the court, the association is terminated and its \"charter\" or authority to transact business is terminated as well. Therefore, no \"charter\" or valid franchise remains entitling a subsequent purchaser to engage in the savings and loan business. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-22.\n\nAm.

The provisions of this paragraph shall not allow the indemnification of directors, officers or employees of a bank against expenses, penalties or other payments incurred in an administrative proceeding or action instituted by an appropriate bank regulatory agency, which proceeding or action results in a final order assessing civil money penalties or requiring affirmative action by an individual in the form of payments to the bank; and\n\n(3) if provided in its articles of incorporation, a bank may acquire and pay the premiums for insurance covering the liability of its directors, officers or employees, except that the provisions of this paragraph shall exclude insurance coverage for a formal order assessing civil money penalties against a bank director, officer or employee.\n\nB. In accordance with his supervisory responsibilities, the director may, in his discretion, review the threat to bank safety and soundness posed by any indemnification or proposed indemnification of directors, officers or employees by a bank or for the consistency of any such indemnification with the standards adopted by that bank in its articles of incorporation. Based upon this review, the director may direct a prospective modification of a specific indemnification by a bank through appropriate administrative action.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 58-1-82, enacted by Laws 1995, ch. 190, § 12.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1995, ch. 190, § 12, repeals former section 58-1-82 NMSA 1978, as enacted by Laws 1963, ch. 305, § 70, relating to unlawful payment of penalties and judgments against others including directors and officers, and enacts the above section, effective June 16, 1995.
