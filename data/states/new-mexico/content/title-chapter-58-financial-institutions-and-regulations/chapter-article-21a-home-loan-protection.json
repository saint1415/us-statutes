      "text": "The legislature finds that:\n\nA. abusive mortgage lending has become an increasing problem in New Mexico, exacerbating the loss of equity in homes and causing the number of foreclosures to increase in recent years;\n\nB. one of the most common forms of abusive lending is the making of loans that are equity-based, rather than income-based;\n\nC. the financing of points and fees in these loans provides immediate income to the originator and encourages creditors to repeatedly refinance home loans; and\n\nD. while the marketplace appears to operate effectively for conventional mortgages, too many homeowners find themselves victims of overreaching creditors who provide loans with high costs and terms that are unnecessary to secure repayment of the loan.\n\nHistory:Laws 2003, ch. 436, § 2.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2003, ch. 436 contains no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 23, is effective June 20, 2003, 90 days after adjournment of the legislature.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2003, ch. 436, § 19A made the Home Loan Protection Act applicable to all home loans made or entered into after January 1, 2004.\n\nEquity-based loan was not subject to the legislative findings set forth in the Home Loan Protection Act.— Where plaintiff bank filed a complaint for foreclosure, alleging that defendant had defaulted on a \"no document\" loan taken out in 2003, approval of which depended on whether defendant's equity and credit score met certain guidelines, and where defendant argued that the equity-based loan was unenforceable as a matter of public policy, claiming that the Home Loan Protection Act (HLPA) 58-21A-1 to 58-21A-14 NMSA 1978, established New Mexico's public policy that equity-based loans were a form of abusive lending and unenforceable, the district did not err in granting summary judgment for plaintiff, because the HLPA did bring every loan within its purview; the legislature used the applicability date to clarify the class of home loans to which the HLPA applies, thus explicitly narrowing the class to loans that were made or entered into after January 1, 2004.Wells Fargo v. Graham, 2023-NMCA-023.\n\nBank did not have \"unclean hands\" in making equity-based loan.— Where plaintiff bank filed a complaint for foreclosure, alleging that defendant had defaulted on a \"no document\" loan taken out in 2003, approval of which depended on whether defendant's equity and credit score met certain guidelines, and where defendant argued that the equity-based loan was unenforceable based on the equitable doctrine of unclean hands, claiming that by approving an equity-based loan with no investigation into defendant's assets and ability to pay, the bank's conduct was fraudulent, illegal or inequitable, the district did not err in granting summary judgment for plaintiff, because the undisputed facts before the district court created no material issue of fact to support equitable relief based on fraudulent, illegal or inequitable conduct by the bank in originating the 2003 loan; to the contrary, defendant's testimony demonstrated that he understood the terms of the loan and purposefully sought the loan because its equity-based terms were the only terms available to him in his financial situation.Wells Fargo v. Graham, 2023-NMCA-023.",

      "text": "A. No creditor shall finance, directly or indirectly, credit life, credit disability, credit unemployment or credit property insurance, or any other life or health insurance, or any payments directly or indirectly for any debt cancellation or suspension agreement or contract, provided that nothing in this subsection prohibits the payment or receipt of insurance premiums or debt cancellation or suspension fees calculated on the unpaid balance of a home loan and paid on a monthly basis.\n\nB. No creditor shall knowingly and intentionally engage in the unfair act or practice of flipping a home loan. As used in this subsection, \"flipping a home loan\" means the making of a home loan to a borrower that refinances an existing home loan when the new loan does not have reasonable, tangible net benefit to the borrower considering all of the circumstances, including the terms of both the new and refinanced loans, the cost of the new loan and the borrower's circumstances.\n\nC. No creditor shall make a home loan without documenting and considering the borrower's reasonable ability to repay that loan pursuant to its terms. The borrower's ability to repay shall be demonstrated through reasonably reliable documentation that may include payroll receipts, tax returns, bank records, asset and credit evaluations, mortgage payment history or other similar reliable documentation. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a home loan originated pursuant to a government streamline program or a streamline program administered by a government-sponsored enterprise, to a reverse mortgage insured as part of a government program or to loss mitigation activities of a home loan servicer or lender with which the borrower has a current relationship, so long as each of these exceptions, as applicable, provides the borrower with a reasonable, tangible net benefit.\n\nD. No creditor shall make a home loan without determining the borrower's reasonable ability to pay the costs set forth in this subsection. In the case of an adjustable rate home loan, the reasonable ability to pay shall be determined based on a fully indexed rate and repayment schedule that achieves full amortization over the life of the home loan. The costs, as applicable, to be used in determining the borrower's reasonable ability to pay include principal, interest, real estate taxes, property insurance, property assessments, mortgage insurance premiums and other scheduled long-term monthly debt payments.\n\nE. No creditor shall make or originate an adjustable rate home loan in which caps on payment increases may be less than that necessary to reduce principal and amortize the loan over the entire term of the loan regardless of interest rate adjustments resulting in negative amortization.\n\nF. No creditor shall make or originate a home loan that includes terms under which more than two periodic payments required under the loan are consolidated and paid in advance from the loan proceeds provided to the borrower.\n\nG. No creditor shall pay a contractor under a home-improvement contract from the proceeds of a home loan unless:\n\n(1) the creditor is presented with a signed and dated completion certificate showing that the home improvements have been completed; or\n\n(2) the instrument is payable jointly to the borrower and the contractor, or at the election of the borrower, through a third-party escrow agent in accordance with terms established in a written agreement signed by the borrower, the creditor and the contractor prior to the disbursement.\n\nH. No creditor shall charge a borrower any fees or other charges, other than those that are bona fide, reasonable and actual, to modify, renew, extend or amend a home loan.\n\nI. No creditor shall charge a borrower more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00) to defer any payment due under the terms of a home loan.\n\nJ. No creditor shall recommend or encourage default on an existing loan or other debt prior to and in connection with the closing or planned closing of a home loan that refinances all or any portion of the existing loan or debt.\n\nK. No creditor shall make a home loan that provides for a late payment fee except as follows:\n\n(1) the late payment fee shall not be in excess of five percent of the amount of the payment past due;\n\n(2) the late payment fee shall only be assessed for a payment past due for fifteen days or more;\n\n(3) the late payment fee shall not be imposed more than once with respect to a single late payment, and no late payment fee shall be charged with respect to a subsequent payment that would have been a full payment but for the previous default or the imposition of the previous late payment fee;\n\n(4) no late payment fee shall be charged unless the creditor notifies the borrower within forty-five days following the date the payment was due that a late payment fee has been imposed for a particular late payment. A late payment fee that the creditor has collected shall be reimbursed if the borrower presents proof of having made a timely payment; and\n\n(5) a creditor shall treat each payment as posted on the same business day as it was received by the creditor, servicer, creditor's agent for making payments or at the address provided to the borrower by the creditor, servicer or creditor's agent for making payments.\n\nL. No creditor shall make a home loan that contains a provision that permits the creditor, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the indebtedness, provided that this provision does not prohibit acceleration of a loan in good faith due to a borrower's failure to abide by the material terms of the loan.\n\nM. No creditor shall make or originate a home loan that contains a provision that requires a penalty or premium for prepayment of the balance or any portion of the principal of the indebtedness.\n\nN. No creditor shall make or originate a home loan that includes or uses one or more of the following lending practices:\n\n(1) making a home loan primarily based upon the foreclosure or liquidation value of the borrower's collateral rather than on the borrower's ability to repay the home loan according to its terms;\n\n(2) making or originating an adjustable rate home loan, except a home equity line of credit, where the interest rate and payment may change more frequently than once every six months during the term of the loan;\n\n(3) making an adjustable rate home loan, except a home equity line of credit, where:\n\n(a) the initial interest rate may be increased by more than two percent for loans with initial periods less than five years and six percent for loans with initial periods greater than or equal to five years;\n\n(b) a periodic interest rate may be increased by more than one percent every six months; and\n\n(c) a lifetime interest rate cap is more than six percent over the initial rate;\n\n(4) advertising terms of home loans, including interest rates, margins, discount points, fees, commissions or other material facts, including limitations on the home loans, unless the creditor is able to make the advertised home loans available to a reasonable number of qualified applicants;\n\n(5) misrepresenting a borrower's credit rating;\n\n(6) misrepresenting, inflating or fabricating, or encouraging a borrower to misrepresent, inflate or fabricate, the source or amount of a borrower's actual income or assets, other than allowable grossed-up income not to exceed the twenty-five percent per agency guidelines established by rule by the director, in the application or underwriting process of a home loan; and\n\n(7) making a home loan with an eighty percent or higher loan-to-value ratio for an owner-occupied residence if the creditor has failed to establish an escrow account for the payment of real estate taxes and property insurance.\n\nHistory:Laws 2003, ch. 436, § 4; 2009, ch. 122, § 56; 2021, ch. 82, § 1.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective June 18, 2021, amended the frequency and limits of adjustments permitted to be made to adjustable rate mortgages originated in New Mexico; and in Subsection N, Paragraph N(2), after \"more frequently than\", changed \"annually\" to \"once every six months\", and in Paragraph N(3), Subparagraph N(3)(b), after \"increased by more than\", changed \"two percent\" to \"one percent every six months\".\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 31, 2009, in Subsection A, after \"paid on a monthly basis\", deleted the remainder of the sentence; and added Subsections C through N.\n\nSeverability.— Laws 2009, ch. 122, § 60 provided that if any part or application of this act is held invalid, the remainder or its application to other situations or persons shall not be affected.\n\nAct not preempted by federal law.— The Home Loan Protection Act, Section 58-21A-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., is a state law of general applicability that is not preempted by federal law.Bank of New York v. Romero, 2014-NMSC-007,rev'g2011-NMCA-110, 150 N.M. 769, 266 P.3d 638.\n\nAbility to repay.— A lender must consider a borrower's ability to repay a home mortgage loan in determining whether the loan provides a reasonable, tangible net benefit as required by the Home Loan Protection Act, Section 58-21A-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.Bank of New York v. Romero, 2014-NMSC-007,rev'g2011-NMCA-110, 150 N.M. 769, 266 P.3d 638.\n\nReasonable, tangible net benefit standard.— The reasonable, tangible new benefit standard of Subsection B of Section 58-21A-4 NMSA 1978 requires a finding that the benefit of making the home loan outweighs the costs associated with the loan. A lender must make a reasonable inquiry of the borrower that refinancing an existing home is in the borrower's interest.Bank of N.Y. v. Romero, 2011-NMCA-110, 150 N.M. 769, 266 P.3d 638, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-010.\n\nRefinancing loan did not constitute \"flipping a home loan\".— Where defendants, who were in default on their home loan and in debt on credit card and other loan obligations wanted to refinance their home to repay their debts and to restock their clothing and music business; and defendants obtained a new home loan from plaintiff that allowed defendants to pay their existing home loan and credit card and other loan obligations and to restock their store, plaintiff did not engage in \"flipping a home loan\", because defendants received a reasonable, net tangible benefit from the new loan.Bank of N.Y. v. Romero, 2011-NMCA-110, 150 N.M. 769, 266 P.3d 638, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-010.",

No creditor or mortgage loan originator making a high-cost home loan shall directly or indirectly finance any points or fees in excess of two percent of the principal loan amount.\n\nB.

Before an action is filed to foreclose or collect money due pursuant to a home loan or before other action is taken to seize or transfer ownership of property subject to a home loan, the creditor or creditor's assignee of the loan shall deliver to the borrower a notice of the right to cure the default informing the borrower of:\n\n(1) the nature of the default;\n\n(2) the borrower's right to cure the default by paying the sum of money required, provided that a creditor or assignee shall accept any partial payment made or tendered in response to the notice. If the amount necessary to cure the default will change within thirty days of the notice, due to the application of a daily interest rate or the addition of late fees, as allowed by the Home Loan Protection Act, the notice shall give sufficient information to enable the borrower to calculate the amount at any point within the thirty-day period;\n\n(3) the date by which the borrower may cure the default to avoid a court action, acceleration and initiation of foreclosure or other action to seize the property, which date shall not be less than thirty days after the date the notice is delivered, and the name and address and telephone number of a person to whom the payment or tender shall be made;\n\n(4) that if the borrower does not cure the default by the date specified, the creditor or assignee may file an action for money due or take steps to terminate the borrower's ownership in the property by requiring payment in full of the home loan and commencing a foreclosure proceeding or other action to seize the property; and\n\n(5) the name and address and the telephone number of a person whom the borrower may contact if the borrower disagrees with the assertion that a default has occurred or the correctness of the calculation of the amount required to cure the default.\n\nB.

Cure of the default shall reinstate the borrower to the same position as if the default had not occurred and shall nullify, as of the date of the cure, an acceleration of any obligation under the home loan arising from the default.\n\nC. To cure a default under this section, a borrower shall not be required to pay any charge, fee or penalty attributable to the exercise of the right to cure a default, other than the fees specifically allowed by this subsection. The borrower shall not be liable for any attorney fees relating to the default that are incurred by the creditor or assignee prior to or during the thirty-day period set forth in Subsection A of this section, nor for any such fees in excess of one hundred dollars ($100) that are incurred by the creditor or assignee after the expiration of the thirty-day period but prior to the time the creditor or assignee files a foreclosure or other judicial action or takes other action to seize or transfer ownership of the real estate. After the creditor or assignee files a foreclosure or other judicial action or takes other action to seize or transfer ownership of the real estate, the borrower shall only be liable for attorney fees that are reasonable and actually incurred by the creditor or assignee, based on a reasonable hourly rate and a reasonable number of hours.\n\nD. If a default is cured prior to the initiation of any action to foreclose or to seize the residence, the creditor or assignee shall not institute a proceeding or other action for that default. If a default is cured after the initiation of any action, the creditor or assignee shall take such steps as are necessary to terminate the action.\n\nE. A creditor or a creditor's assignee of a home loan that has the legal right to foreclose shall, in a foreclosure, use the judicial foreclosure procedures provided by law. In such a proceeding, the borrower may assert the nonexistence of a default and any other claim or defense to acceleration and foreclosure, including any based on a violation of the Home Loan Protection Act, though no such claim or defense shall be deemed a compulsory counterclaim.\n\nHistory:Laws 2003, ch. 436, § 6; 2009, ch. 122, § 58.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 31, 2009, deleted former Subsection F, which provided that the act applied only to high-cost home loans at the time of origination.\n\nSeverability.— Laws 2009, ch. 122, § 60 provided that if any part or application of this act is held invalid, the remainder or its application to other situations or persons shall not be affected.",

A purchaser or assignee has exercised such due diligence if the purchaser or assignee:\n\n(1) has in place at the time of the purchase or assignment of the subject loans, policies that expressly prohibit its purchase or acceptance of an assignment of any high-cost home loans;\n\n(2) requires by contract that a seller or assignor of the home loans to the purchaser or assignee represents and warrants to the purchaser or assignee that either:\n\n(a) the seller or assignor will not sell or assign any high-cost home loans to the purchaser or assignee; or\n\n(b) that such seller or assignor is the beneficiary of such a representation and warranty from a previous seller or assignor; and\n\n(3) exercises reasonable due diligence at the time of purchase or assignment of home loans or within a reasonable period of time thereafter intended by the purchaser or assignee to prevent the purchaser or assignee from purchasing or taking assignment of any high-cost home loans; or\n\n(4) satisfies the requirements in Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection and establishes that a reasonable person exercising ordinary due diligence could not determine, based on the documentation required by the federal Truth in Lending Act and the itemization of the amount financed and other disclosure disbursements, that the loan was a high-cost home loan.\n\nB. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a borrower acting only in an individual capacity may assert against the creditor or any subsequent holder or assignee of the home loan:\n\n(1) within six years of the closing of a high-cost home loan, a violation of the Home Loan Protection Act in connection with the loan as an original action;\n\n(2) at any time during the term of a high-cost home loan, any defense, claim or counterclaim, or action to enjoin foreclosure or to preserve or obtain possession of the dwelling that secures the loan, including but not limited to a violation of the Home Loan Protection Act, after an action to collect on the home loan or foreclose on the collateral securing the home loan has been initiated or the debt arising from the home loan has been accelerated or the home loan has become sixty days in default; or\n\n(3) within three years of the closing of a home loan, a violation of Subsection B of Section 4 [58-21A-4 NMSA 1978] of the Home Loan Protection Act as a defense, claim or counterclaim or as an action to enjoin foreclosure or to preserve or obtain possession of the dwelling that secures the loan, after an action to collect on the home loan or foreclose on the collateral securing the home loan has been initiated or the debt arising from the home loan has been accelerated or the home loan has become sixty days in default.\n\nC.
