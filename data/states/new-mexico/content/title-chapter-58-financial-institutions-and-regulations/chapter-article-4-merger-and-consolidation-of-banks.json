If the director of the division approves the plan of conversion, then the association shall submit the plan to the stockholders. After approval of the plan of conversion, the director shall supervise and monitor the conversion process and shall ensure that the conversion is conducted pursuant to law and the association's approved plan of conversion.\n\nH. After lawful notice to the stockholders of the association and full and fair disclosure of the plan of conversion, the plan shall be approved by a majority of the total votes that stockholders of the association are eligible and entitled to cast. Stockholders may vote in person or by proxy. Following the vote of the stockholders, the association shall file with the director of the division the results of the vote certified by an appropriate officer of the association. The director shall then approve the requested conversion, and the association shall file with the state corporation commission [public regulation commission] articles of incorporation with the certificate of the approval of the director attached. The conversion of the association to a bank shall be effective upon this filing.\n\nI. The director of the division may authorize the resulting bank to:\n\n(1) wind up any activities legally engaged in by the association at the time of conversion but not permitted to state banks; and\n\n(2) retain for a transitional period any assets and deposit liabilities legally held by the association at the effective date of the conversion that may not be held by state banks.\n\nJ. Upon conversion of an association to a bank, the legal existence of the association does not terminate, and the resulting bank is a continuation of the association. The conversion shall be a mere change in identity, form or organization. All rights, liabilities, obligations, interest and relations of whatever kind of the association shall continue and remain in the resulting bank. Except as may be authorized during a transitional period by the director of the division, a bank resulting from the conversion of an association shall have only those rights, powers and duties that are authorized for banks by law. All actions and legal proceedings to which the association was a party prior to conversion shall be unaffected by the conversion and shall proceed as if the conversion had not taken place.\n\nK. As used in this section, \"conversion\" includes:\n\n(1) a transaction in which a state bank assumes all or substantially all of the liabilities and purchases all or substantially all of the assets of an association; and\n\n(2) any other transaction that results in a change of identity of an association to a state bank.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 58-4-13, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 210, § 3.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nLaws 1998, ch. 108, § 80 provided that references to the state corporation commission be construed as references to the public regulation commission.",
