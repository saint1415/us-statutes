      "text": "A. The legislature hereby finds and declares that:\n\n(1) the high cost and lack of availability of industrial loans for small- and medium-sized businesses make it difficult for many of these industrial and agricultural enterprises in New Mexico to hold or increase their present employment levels, and, as a result of the continuing increase in construction costs and other expenses, the state suffers from structural economic weaknesses which contribute to chronic unemployment and underemployment;\n\n(2) the lack of gainful employment puts added pressure on the state's social programs and increases the cost of unemployment compensation to the existing enterprises of the state;\n\n(3) the availability of financial assistance and suitable facilities is an important inducement to industrial, commercial and agricultural enterprises to remain and locate within the state; and\n\n(4) it is an important function of government to increase opportunities for gainful employment and improved living conditions, assist in promoting a balanced and productive economy, encourage the flow of private capital for investment in productive enterprises and otherwise improve the prosperity, health and general welfare of the inhabitants of the state.\n\nB. The legislature further finds and determines that:\n\n(1) the establishment of an industrial and agricultural finance authority for the purpose of carrying out the powers granted in the Industrial and Agricultural Finance Authority Act is necessary to encourage and promote the provisions of productive facilities in areas of the state, especially in areas of high unemployment, where such facilities are needed to meet the aforesaid needs; and\n\n(2) the advantages of this program to the general public would include an increase in the gainful employment of the citizens; a decrease in social services and unemployment compensation costs; an increase in the tax base of the state; an increase in the inventory of industrial, commercial and agricultural sites and modern industrial, commercial and agricultural buildings suitable to house new or expanding industrial, commercial and agricultural enterprises; and the expansion, reclamation or renovation of existing buildings to house new or expanding industrial, commercial and agricultural enterprises.\n\nC. It is therefore expressly declared that the provisions of the Industrial and Agricultural Finance Authority Act and the powers conferred therein on the authority constitute a needed program in the public interest and serve a necessary and valid public purpose.\n\nHistory:Laws 1983, ch. 300, § 2.",

There is created a public body politic and corporate to be known as the \"New Mexico industrial and agricultural finance authority.\" The authority is hereby constituted a public instrumentality, and the exercise by the authority of the powers conferred by the Industrial and Agricultural Finance Authority Act shall be deemed to be the performance of an essential governmental function. The authority shall be separate and apart from the state and shall not be subject to the supervision or control of any board, bureau, department or agency of the state except as specifically provided in the Industrial and Agricultural Finance Authority Act.\n\nB. The authority shall be governed and its corporate powers exercised by a board of directors consisting of seven members. The secretary of commerce and industry [superintendent of regulation and licensing], the director of the New Mexico department of agriculture and the director of the financial institutions division of the commerce and industry department [regulation and licensing department] shall be ex officio members of the board with voting privileges. The governor, with the advice and consent of the senate, shall appoint the other four directors, who shall be residents of the state, at least one of whom shall have a knowledge of industrial and commercial activity in the state and at least one of whom shall have a knowledge of agricultural activity in the state. The four directors of the board appointed by the governor shall be appointed for terms of four years or less, staggered so that the term of not more than one director expires on January 1 of each year.

Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman or whenever three members shall so request in writing. A majority of members then in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business and for the exercise of any power or function of the board. No vacancy in the membership of the board shall impair the rights of a quorum to exercise all the rights and to perform all the duties of the board.

The notes may be issued for any corporate purpose of the authority. All such notes shall be issued and secured and shall be subject to the provisions of the Industrial and Agricultural Finance Authority Act in the same manner and to the same extent as bonds issued pursuant to the Industrial and Agricultural Finance Authority Act.\n\nG. It is the intention of the legislature that any pledge of assets, earnings, revenues or other money made by the authority shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; that the earnings, revenues or other money so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act; and that the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the authority irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.\n\nH.
