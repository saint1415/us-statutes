A title company that maintains one or more trust accounts or escrow accounts into which customer funds are deposited for use in the purchase, sale or financing of real property located in New Mexico may maintain one or more pooled interest-bearing transaction accounts and may deposit customer funds into those accounts, except for funds required to be deposited into interest-bearing accounts or investments under instructions from one or more of the parties to a transaction that provide for the payment of interest to be earned on the deposited funds to a person other than the title company. A pooled interest-bearing transaction account established pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be maintained in the name of the title company, but the trustee shall be named and shown as the beneficial owner of the account income or interest. A title company maintaining one or more pooled interest-bearing transaction accounts shall not be paid or receive any interest earned on funds deposited in the accounts except for the purpose of remitting net earned interest to the trustee pursuant to the provisions of this section.\n\nB. The interest earned on customer funds deposited in a pooled interest-bearing transaction account pursuant to the requirements of Subsection A of this section, net of any service charges and fees that a depository institution charges to regular, non-title company depositors and net of any reasonable charge for preparation and transmittal of any required report pursuant to the provisions of Subsection F of this section, shall be remitted monthly or quarterly either directly to the fund or to the title company for its remittance to the fund. Alternatively, the depository institution may credit the title company account with the net interest earned either monthly or quarterly. Interest accrued after deducting the allowable charges and fees shall be treated as interest earned by the trustee and reported as such by the depository institution.\n\nC. The provisions of this section shall not change existing duties or obligations of a title company under other laws to safeguard and account for funds held for customers.\n\nD. Funds in each pooled interest-bearing transaction account shall be subject to withdrawal upon request and without delay, subject only to the notice period the depository institution is required to observe by law or rule.\n\nE. The rate of interest payable on a pooled interest-bearing transaction account shall not be less than the rate customarily paid by the depository institution to regular, non-title company depositors for similar accounts. Interest shall be computed in accordance with the depository institution's standard accounting practice. Higher rates offered by the depository institution to customers whose deposits exceed certain time or quantity minima, such as those offered in the form of certificates of deposit, may be obtained by the title company on some or all of the deposited funds so long as there is no impairment of the right to withdraw or transfer principal, subject only to the notice period the depository institution is required to observe by law or rule.\n\nF. A depository institution or title company making a remittance of interest to the fund shall at the time of the remittance transmit a report to the trustee for each account from which remittance is made showing:\n\n(1) the name of the title company maintaining the account from which remittance is made;\n\n(2) the rate of interest used to compute the earned interest and the amount of earned interest;\n\n(3) the amount, if any, of depository institution service charges and fees deducted and any charge for the preparation and transmittal of the report; and\n\n(4) the account balance as of the ending date of the reporting period.\n\nG. If the depository institution remits to the title company or credits the title company account, it shall make the remittance or credit no later than ten days after the statement cutoff for that account. The title company shall remit to the fund and shall send the report with the remittance no later than thirty days after receipt of the remittance or credit by the depository institution.\n\nH. Remittances to the fund shall be made at least quarterly, no later than ten days after the statement cutoff for that account if made by the depository institution and no later than thirty days after receipt of remittance or credit from the depository institution if made by the title company.\n\nI.
