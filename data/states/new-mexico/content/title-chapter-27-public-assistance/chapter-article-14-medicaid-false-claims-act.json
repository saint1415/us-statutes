The complaint shall not be served on the defendant until the expiration of sixty days or any extension approved. Within sixty days after receiving a copy of the complaint, the department shall conduct an investigation of the factual allegations and legal contentions made in the complaint, shall make a written determination of whether there is substantial evidence that a violation has occurred and shall provide the person against which a complaint has been made with a copy of the determination.

A payment to a person pursuant to this subsection shall be made from the proceeds.

All such expenses, fees and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.\n\nC. Whether or not the department proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action that the party would otherwise receive pursuant to Subsection A or B of this section, taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation.
