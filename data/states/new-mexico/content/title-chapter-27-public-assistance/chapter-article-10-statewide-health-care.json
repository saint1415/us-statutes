      "text": "A. Access to health care reduces long-term medical and social costs. The effectiveness of statewide health care has been decreased by excessive fragmentation and failure to maximize the use of existing in-state revenues and to develop effective ways of drawing upon potential federal revenue sources. An effective statewide health care system must retain local health care efforts, stimulate local innovations for meeting particular health care needs and use existing resources to expand health care options, especially for those citizens unable to pay for their own care.\n\nB. The purpose of the county-supported medicaid fund is to leverage existing resources to better address the state's health care needs. The county-supported medicaid fund will be used to accomplish this purpose by using local revenues to support the state medicaid program and to institute or support primary care health care services pursuant to Section 24-1A-3.1 NMSA 1978. Money appropriated from the county-supported medicaid fund to institute or support primary care health care services pursuant to Section 24-1A-3.1 NMSA 1978 shall be supplemental to general fund appropriations.\n\nHistory:Laws 1991, ch. 212, § 2; 1993, ch. 321, § 19; 1996, ch. 29, § 5.\n\nThe 1996 amendment,effective May 15, 1996, in Subsection B, inserted \"or support\" in the second sentence and added the last sentence.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, substituted \"to support the state medicaid program\" for \"solely to expand eligibility for federal medicaid optional coverages in supplementation to mandated federal medicaid services\" in the second sentence of Subsection B.",

Income earned from investment of the fund shall be credited to the county-supported medicaid fund.\n\nB. Money in the county-supported medicaid fund is subject to appropriation by the legislature to support the state medicaid program and to institute or support primary care health care services pursuant to Subsections D and E of Section 24-1A-3.1 NMSA 1978. Of the amount appropriated each year, nine percent shall be appropriated to the health care authority to institute or support primary care health care services pursuant to Subsections D and E of Section 24-1A-3.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. Up to three percent of the county-supported medicaid fund each year may be expended for administrative costs related to medicaid or developing new primary care health care centers or facilities.\n\nD. In the event federal funds for medicaid are not received by New Mexico for any eighteen-month period, the unencumbered balance remaining in the county-supported medicaid fund and the safety net care pool fund at the end of the fiscal year following the end of any eighteen-month period shall be paid within a reasonable time to each county for deposit in the county health care assistance fund in proportion to the payments made by each county through tax revenues or transfers in the previous fiscal year as certified by the local government division of the department of finance and administration.

      "text": "A. In the event a county does not enact an ordinance imposing a county health care gross receipts tax pursuant to Section 7-20D-3 [7-20E-18] NMSA 1978, the county shall, by ordinance to be effective July 1, 1993, dedicate to the county-supported medicaid fund an amount equal to a gross receipts tax rate of one-sixteenth of one percent applied to the taxable gross receipts reported during the prior fiscal year by persons engaging in business in the county. For purposes of this subsection, a county may use funds from any existing authorized revenue source of the county.\n\nB. For each county that has in effect an ordinance enacted pursuant to Subsection A of this section on July 1 of each year, the taxation and revenue department shall certify to the county by September 15, 1993 and by September 15 of each subsequent fiscal year the amount of gross receipts reported for the county for purposes of the gross receipts tax during the prior fiscal year. Upon certification by the department, any county enacting an ordinance pursuant to Subsection A of this section shall transfer to the county-supported medicaid fund by the last day of March, June, September and December of each year an amount equal to a rate of one-sixty-fourth of one percent applied to the certified amount.\n\nC. The requirements of an ordinance enacted pursuant to this section may be terminated for a county only on the effective date of an ordinance enacted by the county imposing the county health care gross receipts tax; provided that if the effective date of the ordinance imposing the tax is January 1, the termination does not apply to the payments required for September and December of that year.\n\nHistory:Laws 1991, ch. 212, § 4; 1992, ch. 31, § 3; 1993, ch. 321, § 21.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.
