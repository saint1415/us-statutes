      "text": "Although in recent years New Mexico has shown improvement in indices such as personal income and the number of families below the poverty level, the state continues to compare poorly with other states. New Mexico has risen from 48th in 1974 to 41st in per capita personal income; however, poverty continues to be the lot of a substantial number of New Mexicans. New Mexico can achieve its full economic and social potential only if every individual has the opportunity to contribute to the full extent of his capabilities and to participate in the working of our society. It is, therefore, the policy of this state to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty in this state by opening to everyone the opportunity to live in decency and dignity. It is the purpose of the Community Action Act to strengthen, supplement and coordinate efforts in furtherance of that policy.\n\nHistory:Laws 1983, ch. 139, § 2.",
