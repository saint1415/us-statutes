      "heading": "Fair hearing.",
      "text": "A. An applicant for or recipient of assistance or services under any provisions of the Public Assistance Act [27-2-1 NMSA 1978], Social Security Act or Special Medical Needs Act [Chapter 27, Article 4 NMSA 1978] or regulations of the board adopted pursuant to those acts may request a hearing in accordance with regulations of the board if:\n\n(1) an application is not acted upon within a reasonable time after the filing of the application;\n\n(2) an application is denied in whole or in part; or\n\n(3) the assistance or services are modified, terminated or not provided.\n\nThe department shall notify the recipient or applicant of his rights under this section.\n\nB. The board shall by regulation establish procedures for the filing of a request for a hearing and the time limits within which a request may be filed; provided, however, that the department may grant reasonable extensions of the time limits. If the request is not filed within the specified time for appeal or within whatever extension the department may grant, the department action shall be final. Upon receipt of a timely request, the department shall give the applicant or recipient reasonable notice of an opportunity for a fair hearing in accordance with the regulations of the board.\n\nC. The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer designated by the director. The powers of the hearing officer shall include administering oaths or affirmations to witnesses called to testify, taking testimony, examining witnesses, admitting or excluding evidence and reopening any hearing to receive additional evidence. The technical rules of evidence and the rules of civil procedure shall not apply. The hearing shall be conducted so that the contentions or defenses of each party to the hearing are amply and fairly presented. Either party may be represented by counsel or other representative of his designation, and he or his representative may conduct cross-examination. Any oral or documentary evidence may be received, but the hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence.\n\nD. The director shall review the record of the proceedings and shall make a decision thereon. The applicant or recipient or his representative shall be notified in writing of the director's decision and the reasons for the decision. The written notice shall inform the applicant or recipient of his right to judicial review. The department shall be responsible for assuring that the decision is enforced.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 13-18-3, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 256, § 3; 1991, ch. 155, § 3.\n\nCross references.— For the federal Social Security Act,see42 U.S.C.S. § 301 et seq.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, in Subsection A, substituted \"Social Security Act\" for \"Social Services Act\" near the beginning and added \"or not provided\" at the end of Paragraph (3) and made minor stylistic changes in Subsections A and D.\n\nJudicial review.— In reviewing an administrative decision, the courts must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the decision.N.M. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Tapia, 1982-NMSC-033, 97 N.M. 632, 642 P.2d 1091.\n\nConsideration of evidence not presented to the original caseworker.— Regardless of whether the original caseworker had access to the evidence, a hearing officer should consider new evidence that tends to establish eligibility at the time of the original denial of benefits.Carter v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 2009-NMCA-063, 146 N.M. 422, 211 P.3d 219.\n\nConsideration of evidence not presented to the original caseworker.— Where a case worker formally denied the petitioner's application for medicaid benefits on February 9, 2006, because the petitioner's bank statements for November and December 2005 showed that the petitioner was financially ineligible to receive benefits; at the administrative hearing on the petitioner's appeal, the petitioner introduced the petitioner's bank statement for February 2006, which showed that the petitioner was financially eligible for benefits; the hearing officer did not consider the February statement because the bank statement had not been considered by the case worker; and the hearing officer affirmed the caseworker's denial of the petitioner's application for benefits, the hearing officer should have considered the petitioner's February bank statement, because the bank statement tended to establish the petitioner's eligibility for benefits on February 1, 2006, as provided by 8.281.500.10 NMAC, prior to the denial of the petitioner's application on February 9, 2006.Carter v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 2009-NMCA-063, 146 N.M. 422, 211 P.3d 219.\n\nRight to hearing.— Medicaid recipient's allegations of both a past lack of success with the type of conventional therapy offered by her HMO and a history of successful treatment by licensed physicians employing non-conventional therapy were sufficient to entitle her to a fair hearing to determine whether her HMO in fact has contracted with providers having the necessary qualifications to provide her with appropriate treatment.Hyden v. Human Servs. Dep't, 2000-NMCA-107, 130 N.M. 19, 16 P.3d 444.\n\nMedical assistance division does not have the authority to resolve discrimination claims.— Where petitioner, a member of a managed care organization (MCO) that contracts with the human services department (HSD) [health care authority department] to administer the provision of medicaid benefits and services, including non-emergency medical transportation, to eligible members, made requests of the MCO, pursuant to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA Title II) and Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act, for certain accommodations in the provision of transportation services, and where the MCO denied petitioner's request for reasonable accommodations in accessing medicaid services, and where petitioner requested a fair hearing to appeal the failure of the MCO and HSD to grant her reasonable accommodations in medicaid transportation services, the district court did not err in affirming HSD's medical assistance division's (division) dismissal of the matter, because neither the Public Assistance Act nor the Medicaid Act relied on by petitioner expressly grants the division the power to resolve discrimination claims raised by a medicaid beneficiary challenging an agency's denial or inaction in response to a request for accommodation, nor is any such power vested in the division by any regulation promulgated under state law.Law v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 2019-NMCA-066, cert. denied.\n\nRequirement that medical reports evidence be available for examination.— Since medical reports are written information, they cannot be made a part of a hearing record or be used in making a decision on the case unless they have been made available for examination prior to or during the hearing.Hillman v. Health & Soc. Servs. Dep't, 1979-NMCA-007, 92 N.M. 480, 590 P.2d 179.\n\nConsideration of report not properly admitted into evidence held harmless error.— Where a report is not available to recipient before the hearing is concluded, and is not properly admitted into evidence, consideration of this report by the hearing officer violates the program manual but where the report does no more than agree with previous reports of specialists, which were properly in evidence and which provide substantial support for the decision to terminate benefits, consideration of the report is harmless error.State ex rel. Human Servs. Dep't v. Gomez, 1982-NMSC-153, 99 N.M. 261, 657 P.2d 117.\n\nTermination of benefits cannot be based upon information outside record.Hillman v. Health & Soc. Servs. Dep't, 1979-NMCA-007, 92 N.M. 480, 590 P.2d 179.\n\nTermination hearing must protect claimant's opportunity to present case.— Any decision terminating a claimant's benefits must be based on a hearing which fully protects the claimant's opportunity to present his case; specifically, the option to examine all medical reports prior to or during the hearing.Hillman v. Health & Soc. Servs. Dep't, 1979-NMCA-007, 92 N.M. 480, 590 P.2d 179.\n\nHearing conducted by telephone not denial of due process.— A recipient of welfare benefits is not deprived of due process because his termination hearing is conducted by telephone and not in the presence of a hearing officer who can observe his demeanor.State ex rel. Human Servs. Dep't v. Gomez, 1982-NMSC-153, 99 N.M. 261, 657 P.2d 117.\n\nReasons for decision.— Although the director signed a form paragraph entitled \"Final Decision\" and inserted a check mark indicating \"[d]ecided in favor of Dept.,\" his signature and the check mark failed to comply with Subsection D because they did not indicate the reason for his decision. Specifically, the director failed to indicate whether he adopted or approved the findings and conclusions of the hearing officer or whether he reached his decision on some other basis.Green v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 1988-NMCA-083, 107 N.M. 628, 762 P.2d 915.\n\nBurden on department to inform about subsequent hearing opportunities.— The burden of informing an applicant/recipient of the opportunity to present his case in light of new medical reports and social summaries at subsequent hearings is placed upon the department.Hillman v. Health & Soc. Servs. Dep't, 1979-NMCA-007, 92 N.M. 480, 590 P.2d 179.\n\nNo duty to inform of right to reapply.— There is nothing in the statutes or regulations that would impose upon the department the duty to inform an applicant to reapply for benefits.Landavazo v. N.M. Dep't of Human Servs., 1988-NMCA-002, 106 N.M. 715, 749 P.2d 538.\n\nSubsequent change of circumstance.— Where an applicant's application for food stamp benefits was originally denied by the county office because the resource maximum for his household was exceeded by the value of his vehicle, and he then modified his vehicle to accommodate his physical handicap, so as to exclude it from consideration as a resource, this modification constituted a changed condition or circumstance subsequent to the original denial of his application, so that the hearing officer did not err in refusing to consider this evidence. The applicant's proper remedy was to reapply for benefits.Landavazo v. N.M. Dep't of Human Servs., 1988-NMCA-002, 106 N.M. 715, 749 P.2d 538.\n\nDepartment is bound by its own regulations.Hillman v. Health & Soc. Servs. Dep't, 1979-NMCA-007, 92 N.M. 480, 590 P.2d 179.\n\nNotice of right of review.— This section provides for joint notice of decision and notice of the right of review, and, consequently, the notice of the right of review can be sent to a representative who has represented the applicant at the hearing and who receives notice of the director's decision.James v. N.M. Human Serv. Dep't, 1987-NMCA-105, 106 N.M. 318, 742 P.2d 530, cert. quashed, 106 N.M. 353, 742 P.2d 1058.\n\nTardy notice of appeal.— An applicant may not rely on inaccurate information in her notification from the director under this section as to the time for taking an appeal to excuse the tardy filing of her notice of appeal.James v. N.M. Human Serv. Dep't, 1987-NMCA-105, 106 N.M. 318, 742 P.2d 530, cert. quashed, 106 N.M. 353, 742 P.2d 1058.\n\nScope of judicial review of \"fair hearing\" decision.— A judicial review of a \"fair hearing\" decision is not limited to whether the department's representative proceeded properly on the basis of information known prior to the \"fair hearing\". On the contrary, the evidence that is considered is the evidence contained in the record of the entire \"fair hearing.\"Cruz v. N.M. Dep't of Human Servs., 1983-NMCA-080, 100 N.M. 133, 666 P.2d 1280 (decided prior to 1999 amendment to Section 27-3-4 NMSA 1978).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Survey of New Mexico Law, 1979-80: Administrative Law,\" see 11 N.M.L. Rev. 1 (1981).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —Representation by attorney of social security benefit claimant in administrative proceeding, 59 A.L.R. Fed. 595.",

      "text": "Within thirty days after receiving written notice of the decision of the director pursuant to Section 27-3-3 NMSA 1978, an applicant or recipient may file a notice of appeal with the district court pursuant to the provisions of Section 39-3-1.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 13-18-4, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 256, § 4; 1998, ch. 55, § 37; 1999, ch. 265, § 39.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, substituted \"Section 39-3-1.1\" for \"Section 12-8A-1\".\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective September 1, 1998, rewrote this section to the extent that a detailed comparison is impracticable.\n\nTime for filing notice of appeal.— Because the requirement of the time for filing notice of an appeal from a decision of an administrative board or agency lies within the supreme court's rule-making authority, and because such timing is now covered by Rule 12-601A NMRA, requiring filing notice within 30 days of the decision appealed from, not this section, requiring filing notice within 30 days of receipt of written notice of the decision, governs.James v. N.M. Human Serv. Dep't, 1987-NMCA-105, 106 N.M. 318, 742 P.2d 530 (decided prior to 1999 amendment).\n\nReview of administrative decisions where whole record considered.— Because of the minor departure from the customary substantial evidence rule in reviewing administrative decisions where the record as a whole must be considered, the reviewing court may act on other convincing evidence in the record and may make its own findings based thereon.N.M. Human Servs. Dep't v. Garcia, 1980-NMSC-025, 94 N.M. 175, 608 P.2d 151 (decided prior to 1999 amendment).\n\nIn reviewing an administrative decision, the courts must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the decision.N.M. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Tapia, 1982-NMSC-033, 97 N.M. 632, 642 P.2d 1091 (decided prior to 1999 amendment).\n\nIn order to determine whether a decision by the human services department [health care authority department] is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole, the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the decision by the human services department [health care authority department]; this does not permit accepting part of the evidence and totally disregarding other convincing evidence in the record considered as a whole.N.M. Human Servs. Dep't v. Garcia, 1980-NMSC-025, 94 N.M. 175, 608 P.2d 151 (decided prior to 1999 amendment).\n\nThe court of appeals does not reweigh the evidencenor resolve any conflicts in evidence. If there is substantial evidence on which a reasonable mind would have made such a decision, the court should affirm the administrative officer's decision.Montoya v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 1989-NMCA-017, 108 N.M. 263, 771 P.2d 196 (decided prior to 1999 amendment).\n\nNonincome producing property not bar to benefits.— When the evidence shows that the property cannot be utilized to produce income and a sale of the property would produce no income, the applicants for public assistance are eligible for benefits; therefore, the department's decision to deny aid to families with dependent children benefits has no support in the record.Robnett v. N.M. Dep't of Human Servs. Income Support Div., 1979-NMCA-099, 93 N.M. 245, 599 P.2d 398 (decided prior to 1999 amendment).\n\nDenial of benefits based upon substantial evidence.— Substantial evidence in the record as a whole supported the human services department's [health care authority department's] denial of aid to families with dependent children benefits where the natural father could provide support.N.M. Human Servs. Dep't v. Garcia, 1980-NMSC-025, 94 N.M. 175, 608 P.2d 151 (decided prior to 1999 amendment).\n\nArbitrary and capricious action by administrative agencyis evident when it can be said that such action is unreasonable or does not have a rational basis and is the result of an unconsidered, willful and irrational choice of conduct, and not the result of a winnowing and sifting process.Garcia v. N.M. Human Servs. Dep't, 1979-NMCA-071, 94 N.M. 178, 608 P.2d 154,rev'd on other grounds, 1980-NMSC-025, 94 N.M. 175, 608 P.2d 151 (decided prior to 1999 amendment).\n\nFailure to give notice of reason for reduction in benefits.— The action of the department in not giving notice to a recipient of the reason why her benefits were reduced invalidates the decision of the department.Taylor v. Department of Human Servs., 1982-NMCA-107, 98 N.M. 314, 648 P.2d 353 (decided prior to 1999 amendment).\n\nFailure of department to consider certain relevant medical evidencefound to be arbitrary, capricious and not in accordance with law.Saenz v. New Mexico Dep't of Human Servs., 1982-NMCA-159, 98 N.M. 805, 653 P.2d 181 (decided prior to 1999 amendment).\n\nCorrect decision reached for wrong reason not reversed.— A correct decision of the department will not be reversed because the result was reached for the wrong reason where the court finds another valid basis for that result.Melton v. N.M. Dep't of Human Servs., 1981-NMCA-130, 97 N.M. 102, 637 P.2d 52 (decided prior to 1999 amendment).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Use of the Substantial Evidence Rule to Review Administrative Findings of Fact in New Mexico,\" see 10 N.M.L.
