Further, the legislature notes that New Mexico's health care licensure provisions may be contributing to harmful delays in access to health care throughout the state, particularly in areas with acute professional shortages. The legislature believes that efforts begun pursuant to House Joint Memorial 61 of the second session of the forty-fifth legislature and the continued cooperation among respective licensing boards, the regulation and licensing department, various statewide professional associations and societies, insurers and national accrediting and standard setting organizations will produce a system satisfactory to all concerned while maintaining the primary goal of ensuring the health and safety of New Mexico residents\".",

In the absence of clinical guidelines that meet the requirements of Subsection A of this section, peer-reviewed publications may be substituted.\n\nC. When a medical assistance plan restricts coverage of a prescription drug for the treatment of any medical condition through the use of a step therapy protocol, a recipient and the practitioner prescribing the prescription drug shall have access to a clear, readily accessible and convenient process to request a step therapy exception determination. A medical assistance plan may use its existing medical exceptions process in accordance with the provisions of Subsections D through I of this section to satisfy this requirement. The process shall be made easily accessible for recipients and practitioners on the medical assistance plan's publicly accessible website.\n\nD. A medical assistance plan shall expeditiously grant an exception to the medical assistance plan's step therapy protocol, based on medical necessity and a clinically valid explanation from the patient's prescribing practitioner as to why a drug on the plan's formulary that is therapeutically equivalent to the prescribed drug should not be substituted for the prescribed drug, if:\n\n(1) the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request is contraindicated or will likely cause an adverse reaction by or physical or mental harm to the patient;\n\n(2) the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request is expected to be ineffective based on the known clinical characteristics of the patient and the known characteristics of the prescription drug regimen;\n\n(3) while under the recipient's current medical assistance plan, or under the recipient's previous health coverage, the recipient has tried the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class or with the same mechanism of action as the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request and that prescription drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness, diminished effect or an adverse event; or\n\n(4) the prescription drug required pursuant to the step therapy protocol is not in the best interest of the patient, based on clinical appropriateness, because the patient's use of the prescription drug is expected to:\n\n(a) cause a significant barrier to the patient's adherence to or compliance with the patient's plan of care;\n\n(b) worsen a comorbid condition of the patient; or\n\n(c) decrease the patient's ability to achieve or maintain reasonable functional ability in performing daily activities.\n\nE.

A medical assistance plan shall respond with its decision on a recipient's exception request within seventy-two hours of receipt. In cases where exigent circumstances exist, a medical assistance plan shall respond within twenty-four hours of receipt of the exception request. In the event the medical assistance plan does not respond to an exception request within the time frames required pursuant to this subsection, the exception request shall be granted.\n\nG. A medical assistance plan's denial of a request for an exception for step therapy protocols shall be subject to review and appeal pursuant to department rules.\n\nH. After a recipient has made an exception request in accordance with the provisions of this section, a medical assistance plan shall authorize continued coverage of a prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request pending the determination of the exception request.\n\nI. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to prevent:\n\n(1) a medical assistance plan from requiring a patient to try a biosimilar, interchangeable biologic or generic equivalent of a prescription drug before providing coverage for the equivalent brand-name prescription drug; or\n\n(2) a practitioner from prescribing a prescription drug that the practitioner has determined to be medically necessary.\n\nJ. As used in this section, \"medical necessity\" or \"medically necessary\" means health care services determined by a practitioner, in consultation with the medical assistance plan, to be appropriate or necessary, according to:\n\n(1) any applicable, generally accepted principles and practices of good medical care;\n\n(2) practice guidelines developed by the federal government or national or professional medical societies, boards or associations; or\n\n(3) any applicable clinical protocols or practice guidelines developed by the medical assistance plan consistent with federal, national and professional practice guidelines.

The income support division of the department shall make reasonable efforts to ascertain any legal liability of third parties who are or may be liable to pay all or part of the medical cost of injury, disease or disability of an applicant for or recipient of medical assistance pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 27 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. When the department makes medical assistance payments on behalf of a recipient, the department is subrogated to any right of the recipient against a third party for recovery of medical expenses to the extent that the department has made payment.\n\nC. Health insurers, including self-insured plans, group health plans, service benefit plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers or other parties, that are, by statute, contract or agreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for a health care item or service, as a condition of doing business with New Mexico, shall:\n\n(1) provide, with respect to individuals who are eligible for or are provided medical assistance under the medicaid program, upon the request of the state, information to determine during what period the individual, the individual's spouse or the individual's dependents may be, or may have been, covered by a health insurer and the nature of the coverage provided by the health insurer, including the name, address and identifying number of the plan;\n\n(2) accept New Mexico's right of recovery and the assignment to New Mexico of any right of an individual or other entity to payment from the party for an item or service for which payment has been made under the medicaid program;\n\n(3) respond to any inquiry by New Mexico regarding a claim for payment for any health care item or service that is submitted no later than three years after the date of the provision of such health care item or service; and\n\n(4) agree not to deny a claim submitted by New Mexico solely on the basis of the date of submission of the claim by the provider, the type of the claim form or a failure to present proper documentation at the point-of-sale that is the basis of the claim, if:\n\n(a) the claim is submitted by New Mexico within the three-year period beginning on the date on which the item or service was furnished; and\n\n(b) any action by New Mexico to enforce its rights with respect to such claim is commenced within six years of New Mexico's submission of such claim.\n\nD. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the application of common law principles in determining equitable reimbursement from any third-party source for New Mexico or a health insurer, including self-insured plans, group health plans, service benefit plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers or other parties.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 13-1-20.1, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 232, § 1; 2007, ch. 246, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For medical assistance programs generally,see27-2-12 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor liability for repayment of public assistance,see27-2-28 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, added Subsections C and D.\n\nDepartment's subrogationis right of recovery subject to equitable principles.White v.

Where the settlement proceeds in a medical malpractice suit would constitute but a small fraction of a medical assistance recipient's actual damages and any money which the department might recover would be due to a very large extent to the energies expended in pursuing the malpractice claim by the recipient and her attorneys, who were charging a contingent fee of 25 percent of the recovery, the department was not equitably entitled to complete reimbursement for its payments to the recipient.White v. Sutherland, 1978-NMCA-076, 92 N.M. 187, 585 P.2d 331, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 79, 582 P.2d 1292.\n\nEquitable reduction.— Subsection G of Section 27-2-28 NMSA 1978, providing for assignment to the department of a recipient's right to recovery against a tortfeasor, as reconciled with this section and federal law, does not convey the right to full reimbursement in every case, but permits an equitable reduction.Kahrs v.
