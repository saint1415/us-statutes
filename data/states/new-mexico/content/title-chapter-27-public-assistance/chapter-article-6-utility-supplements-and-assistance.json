The Electrical Energy Tax Act was enacted by Laws 1975, Chapter 263 and approved April 10, 1975. Laws 1975, ch. 300, § 10, compiled as 27-6-10 NMSA 1978, provides that no payments shall be made under the Utility Supplement Act if the Electrical Energy Tax Act is held invalid in any suit. The Electrical Energy Tax Act was held invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution in Arizona Pub. Serv. Co. v. Snead, 441 U.S. 141, 99 S. Ct. 1629, 60 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1979). Laws 1982, ch. 18, § 27 later repealed the Electrical Energy Tax Act, effective July 1, 1982. The provisions of 27-6-1 to 27-6-10 NMSA 1978, the Utility Supplement Act, have been deleted from the statutes compilation as they no longer have any force or effect.",
