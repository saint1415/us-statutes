In expending money from the fund, except that for film and multimedia production companies and preemployment training programs for that industry, the board shall employ a preference for training or instructional services for trainees who meet the criterion in Subparagraph (a) of Paragraph (3) of Subsection F of this section over training or instructional services for trainees who meet the criterion in Subparagraph (b) of that paragraph.\n\nD. Subject to the approval of the industrial training board, the economic development division of the economic development department shall:\n\n(1) administer all funds allocated or appropriated for industrial development training purposes;\n\n(2) provide designated training services;\n\n(3) regulate, control and abandon any training program established under the provisions of this section;\n\n(4) assist companies requesting training in the development of a training proposal to meet the companies' workforce needs;\n\n(5) contract for the implementation of all training programs;\n\n(6) provide for training by educational institutions or by a company through in-plant training, at that company's request; and\n\n(7) evaluate training efforts on a basis of performance standards set forth by the industrial training board.\n\nE. The instructional support and vocational education division of the public education department shall provide technical assistance to the economic development department concerning the development of agreements, the determination of the most appropriate instructional training to be provided and the review of training program implementation.\n\nF. Except as provided in Section 21-19-7.1 NMSA 1978 for film and multimedia production companies and preemployment training programs for that industry, the state shall contract with a company or an educational institution to provide training or instructional services in accordance with the approved training proposal and within the following limitations:\n\n(1) payment shall not be made for training in excess of one thousand forty hours of training per trainee for the total duration of training;\n\n(2) trainees shall be guaranteed full-time employment with the contracted company upon successful completion of the training;\n\n(3) trainees shall be of legal status for employment and:\n\n(a) have resided within the state for at least one year at any time before the start of the training program;

and\n\n(b) contributes at least fifty percent of the premium for the health insurance plan for those employees who choose to enroll in it; provided that the fifty percent employer contribution shall not be a requirement for the dependent coverage that is offered.\n\nHistory:Laws 1983, ch. 299, § 1;

in Subsection C, after \"New Mexico and its people\", deleted \"For fiscal years 2018 through 2022\"; and in Subsection F, Subparagraph F(3)(b), deleted \"for fiscal years 2018 through 2022\".\n\nThe 2017 amendment,effective June 16, 2017, temporarily allowed for the reduction of the residency requirement for the workforce development training program of the economic development department when the training provided is for high-wage jobs in certain locations of the state, provided a preference for training or instructional services for trainees who have resided within the state for at least one year in the expenditure of money from the development training fund, and revised the composition of the industrial training board; in Subsection A, after \"furnish qualified\", deleted \"manpower\" and added \"workforce\"; in Subsection B, Paragraph B(2), after \"director of the\", added \"instructional support and\", in Paragraph B(5), after \"employee of the\", added \"workforce solutions\", and after \"department\", deleted \"of labor\"; in Subsection C, after \"oversight to\", deleted \"assure\" and added \"ensure\", after \"legal limits\", added \"while\", and added the second sentence; in Subsection D, Paragraph D(4), after \"companies'\", deleted \"manpower\" and added \"workforce\";

modified Subsection B by removing the director of the job training division of the labor department as a member of the board and substituting the director of the governor's office of workforce training and development and adding an employee of the department of labor as a member of the board;

and deleted the exception in Subsection F(2) for waiver of residency requirement prior to July 1, 2004.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 2005, ch. 102 is contingent upon an \"appropriation for development training in the General Appropriations Act of 2005\". The General Appropriations Act of 2005 does not provide for an appropriation for development training, but rather authorizes use of cash balances in the \"development training fund\". The actual appropriation of funds from the \"development training fund\" is provided by 21-19-11 NMSA 1978 and not the General Appropriations Act of 2005. Section 21-19-11 NMSA 1978 provides that \"Money appropriated to the fund or accruing to it through gifts, grants, repayments or bequests shall not be transferred to any other fund or be encumbered or disbursed in any manner except as provided in Section 21-19-7 NMSA 1978.\" Laws 2005, ch. 33, Subsection D of § 4 of the General Appropriations Act of 2005 provides as follows: \"Notwithstanding Section 21-19-7 NMSA 1978 and Section 21-9-7.1 NMSA 1978, the economic development department may use up to five percent of the cash balances in the development training fund as of December 31, 2004 for skill-enhancement training and pre-employment training programs for the film and multimedia industry.\" This is not actually an appropriation by an authorization to use funds appropriated by Section 21-19-11 NMSA 1978. The prohibition against using funds for another purpose is found in 21-19-11 NMSA 1978 and not 21-19-7 or 21-9-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective January 1, 2004, in Subsection A, deleted \"the particular company\" and \"shall be\" following \"designed for\" in the second sentence; and added Paragraph F(9).\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, added the proviso at the end of the introductory language in Paragraph F(2) and added Subparagraphs F(2)(a) through F(2)(d).\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective April 8, 1997, made a minor stylistic change in Subsection B; substituted \"economic development division of the economic development department\" for \"vocational education division of the state department of public education\" in Subsection D; added Subsection E and redesignated former Subsection E as F; and substituted \"of legal status for employment\" for \"citizens of the United States\" in Paragraph F(1).",
