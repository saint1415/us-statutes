Any person or corporation may institute in the district court of any county in which the off-campus instruction program district affected lies an action or suit to contest the validity of any proceedings held under the Off-Campus Instruction Act, but no such suit or action shall be maintained unless it is instituted within ten days after the issuance by the proper officials of a certificate or notification of the results of the election and the canvassing of the election returns.\n\nK.
