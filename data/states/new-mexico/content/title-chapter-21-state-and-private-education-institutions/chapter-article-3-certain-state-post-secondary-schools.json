Such board shall have the general powers now conferred on boards of regents of the other normal schools of this state; including the power to acquire by donations, the title to the necessary lands for building site and campus, and the acceptance of such other donations as may be available; and provided further, that such board can incur no indebtedness whatever.\n\nHistory:Laws 1927, ch. 79, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 120-1904; 1941 Comp., § 55-2135; 1953 Comp., § 73-22-36.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nN.M.
