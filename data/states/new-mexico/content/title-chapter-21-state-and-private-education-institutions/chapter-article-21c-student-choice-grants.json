The legislature declares that the purpose of the Student Choice Act is to broaden student choice and to make maximum possible utilization of existing postsecondary educational resources and facilities, both public and independent, and thus to benefit the residents of the state. The legislature further finds that the broadening of educational choice will reduce the financial demands on the taxpayers of New Mexico.\n\nHistory:Laws 1983, ch. 240, § 2.",

The hourly rate shall be calculated by taking the general fund appropriations for instruction and general purposes for the university of New Mexico, New Mexico state university, New Mexico highlands university, eastern New Mexico university and western New Mexico university for the fiscal year in which the student choice grant is to be made, subtracting from that sum the portion deemed by the commission [department] to be attributable to other than undergraduate education and dividing by the aggregate number of undergraduate credit hours which were used in the calculation by the board of the general fund appropriations. If the hourly rate calculated under this subsection exceeds the tuition rate at any institution, then the hourly rate for purposes of calculating a student choice grant at that institution shall be the institution's hourly tuition rate;\n\nD. a student choice grant to a part-time student shall be proportional to the student choice grant paid to a full-time student, based on the ratio of part-time credit hours to full-time credit hours;\n\nE. if the money in the student choice fund is less than the amount needed to make the student choice grants in the amounts determined by the commission on higher education [higher education department], each grant to each student shall be reduced proportionally so as to utilize the full amount in the student choice fund; and\n\nF. if a student withdraws or drops below full-time student status and is entitled to a refund for any tuition as determined by each institution's refund policy, the student shall pay to the commission on higher education [higher education department], as a refund of the student choice grant, the amount of any refund to which he is entitled from the institution, not to exceed the amount of the student choice grant awarded to that student.\n\nHistory:Laws 1983, ch. 240, § 5; 1990, ch. 102, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nFor designation of the commission on higher education as the higher education department,see9-25-4.1 NMSA 1978.",
