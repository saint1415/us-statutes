      "text": "A. The New Mexico school for the deaf shall be under the control and management of a board of regents consisting of five members, at least one of whom shall be a deaf person and at least one of whom shall be the parent of a deaf child, to be appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the senate for a term of six years. Not more than three of them shall belong to the same political party at the time of their appointment. The board shall make its own rules and regulations for the government of its meetings and the institution under its care. Annually on the second Monday of April the board shall elect from among its number a president and secretary.\n\nB. The board shall have full power and authority to employ a superintendent, teachers and all other necessary employees to operate the New Mexico school for the deaf in the most efficient manner with the appropriations made therefor, with full power to provide suitable buildings, additions to existing buildings and enlarging and improving the buildings and property now occupied by the school.\n\nC. It is unlawful for any member of the board of regents to incur any indebtedness or provide any improvements, repairs or to enlarge the buildings, except for current expenses, unless there is money on hand in the treasury subject to be used for those purposes.\n\nD. Members of the board of regents shall be reimbursed according to the Per Diem and Mileage Act [10-8-1 to 10-8-8 NMSA 1978] for travel and expenses incurred for each day in actual attendance at board meetings or while engaged in the performance of official business.\n\nE. The board of regents shall present to the governor each year a full and detailed report including an itemized statement of all expenditures and of all its actions during the previous year, with that information and those recommendations it deems necessary and advisable for the governor and the legislature to act upon.\n\nHistory:Laws 1899, ch. 42, § 2; Code 1915, § 5102; C.S. 1929, § 130-404; 1941 Comp., § 55-2303; 1953 Comp., § 73-24-3; Laws 1961, ch. 31, § 1; 1979, ch. 44, § 1; 1981, ch. 19, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For penalty for interest in contracts for supplies,see21-1-35 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor state educational institutions,seeN.M. Const., art. XII, § 11.\n\nFor boards of regents for educational institutions,seeN.M. Const., art. XII, § 13.\n\nEmployee must comply with internal grievance procedures.— An employee must substantially comply with mandatory internal grievance procedures contained in an employee manual or handbook before filing suit for breach of contract claims based on an alleged failure of an employer to follow its employment policies.Lucero v. UNM Board of Regents, 2012-NMCA-055, 278 P.3d 1043, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-004.\n\nWhere a university manager was terminated by the university; the manager did not follow the grievance process contained in the university's employee handbook by filing a grievance; the handbook governed the manager's employment with the university; and the manager filed an action in district court for breach of contract and wrongful termination alleging that the employee handbook created a contract and that the university breached the contract by failing to abide by the handbook's policies and procedures governing workplace performance, disciplinary action, a harassment-free workplace, employer-employee relations, progressive discipline and by disciplining the manager without just cause, the manager's claims were barred because the manager failed to exhaust the handbook's internal grievance procedures before filing the breach of contract action based on an alleged failure of the university to follow policies in the handbook.Lucero v. UNM Board of Regents, 2012-NMCA-055, 278 P.3d 1043, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-004.\n\nImplied powers also possessed.— The board of regents possesses, in addition to the express powers given, those which although not expressly stated are necessarily implied in order that the objects and purposes of the institution may be fully attained. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6169.\n\nPower to designate jury duty as vacation.— The duly constituted board of regents of the school for the deaf is authorized to make decisions according to its sound judgment. It may, or it may not, designate absence of a school employee for jury duty as a vacation period during which time the employee will receive regular pay. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-73 (seeSection 38-5-18 NMSA 1978).\n\nScope and effect of statutory powers.— The New Mexico school for the deaf is not subject to the Personnel Act (see10-9-1 NMSA 1978 and notes thereto). Rather, the control of its employees and the appropriations for the school are placed in the hands of the board of regents of that school under this section, which authorizes the board to make rules and regulations governing the institution. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-73.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —15A Am. Jur. 2d Colleges and Universities §§ 3, 5, 7, 11, 35, 39; 63A Am.

      "text": "A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the New Mexico school for the deaf shall be devoted exclusively to the care and instruction of persons of either sex who are residents within the state and between the ages of five years and the age of majority and who are deaf or hard-of-hearing; provided that the board of regents, in its discretion, may admit residents of this state who have attained the age of one year for daytime care and instruction, but not for residential purposes, and may also admit residents of this state who are over the age of majority.\n\nB. The board of regents may make expenditures for undergraduate collegiate expenses of graduates of the New Mexico school for the deaf. The board of regents may permit the use of facilities of the school by public and private agencies in the state in carrying on a conservation-of-hearing program when the agencies participate in the cost of the operation, upon such terms and conditions as the board of regents may prescribe.\n\nC. The board of regents may contract with the veterans' administration and the vocational rehabilitation division of the public education department to provide instruction for adults with a disability in vocations or lip reading taught at the school, but such adults may not be housed at the school. The board of regents may lease for a nominal sum for periods not to exceed three months to the public schools, institutions and agencies of the state any hearing test equipment owned by the school.\n\nD. The board of regents, for the purpose of creating a source of teachers of the deaf, may pay tuition and other necessary expenses of graduates of New Mexico colleges desiring to take training to teach the deaf in out-of-state training centers and intending to make the teaching of the deaf in New Mexico their profession.\n\nE. All instruction shall be free. Deaf or hard-of-hearing children from other states or territories may be received and educated in the school under such rules and regulations as the board of regents may prescribe, but in no event shall such children be admitted except upon the payment or guaranty of at least one thousand dollars ($1,000) for the school year, on the basis of nine months for a school year. The president of the board of regents is authorized to make and enter into on behalf of the school all necessary agreements and contracts with the United States government and the proper authorities of other states and territories for the reception and education of such children, and the president is further authorized to receive and receipt for all money paid upon such account and to endorse and transfer all checks, vouchers or other evidences of payment made or received in behalf of the school.\n\nHistory:Laws 1899, ch. 42, § 3; Code 1915, § 5103; C.S. 1929, § 130-405; 1941 Comp., § 55-2304; Laws 1945, ch. 80, § 1; 1953, ch. 26, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 73-24-4; Laws 1955, ch. 63, § 1; 1973, ch. 138, § 30; 2007, ch. 46, § 9.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, amended the section to make non-substantive language changes.\n\nScope of power to care.— The board of the deaf school (New Mexico school for the deaf) is vested by law with power to care for children under its control and to provide food, clothing, quarters, medical and such other care as may be necessary to the children's welfare. 1945 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 45-4803.\n\nPower to spend funds limited.— The statute's language would seem to preclude the power to spend the funds of the institution in instructing other than those persons in the institution. The legislature did not intend that personnel from school be dispatched, at institution expense, to places outside the school to prepare others in communicating and otherwise being able to get along with students from the school. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6170.\n\nMeaning of \"resident\".— The term \"resident\" as used in this statute means a person who maintains his \"domicile\" in this state. Domicile is defined as that place where a person maintains his residence with the intention to live there indefinitely. Once established he may leave it and the place may remain his domicile if he intends to return. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6302.\n\nEffect of absence from state for military service.— Mere absence from this state by reason of being in the military service does not change that person's domicile in New Mexico, and thus his or her children would be eligible for admission without payment of the nonresident fee. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6302.\n\nEffect of mere presence by nonresident.— The mere presence of a soldier or sailor from another state at a post in New Mexico does not by that fact alone establish his residence here and for that reason his or her children would not be eligible for admission without payment of a nonresident fee. However, such a person could establish his residence here. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6302.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —15A Am.

The provisions of the laws of New Mexico in regard to compulsory attendance upon the public schools shall be applicable to attendance upon some school for the deaf or the hard of hearing, and the school directors of the several districts are hereby required and directed to enforce the same with regard to this school in the same manner as is provided by those laws for enforcing attendance upon the district schools.\n\nAny failure on the part of any person hereinbefore mentioned to comply with the duties herein provided shall be deemed a misdemeanor and punished as such.\n\nHistory:Laws 1899, ch. 42, § 4; Code 1915, § 5104; C.S. 1929, § 130-406; 1941 Comp., § 55-2305; Laws 1947, ch. 40, § [1]; 1953 Comp., § 73-24-5.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nAm.
