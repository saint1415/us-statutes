If a reciprocal insurer has a surplus of assets over all liabilities at least equal to the minimum capital stock required to be maintained by a domestic stock insurer authorized to transact like kinds of insurance, upon application of the attorney and as approved by the subscribers' advisory committee the superintendent shall issue his certificate authorizing the insurer to extinguish the contingent liability of subscribers under its policies then in force in this state, and to omit provisions imposing contingent liability in all policies delivered or issued for delivery in this state for so long as all such surplus remains unimpaired.\n\nB. Upon impairment of such surplus, the superintendent shall forthwith revoke the certificate. Such revocation shall not render subject to contingent liability any policy then in force and for the remainder of the period for which the premium has theretofore been paid; but after such revocation no policy shall be issued or renewed without providing for contingent assessment liability of the subscriber.\n\nC. The superintendent shall not authorize a domestic reciprocal insurer so to extinguish the contingent liability of any of its subscribers or in any of its policies to be issued, unless it qualifies to and does extinguish such liability of all its subscribers and in all such policies for all kinds of insurance transacted by it; but if required by the laws of another state in which the insurer is transacting insurance as an authorized insurer, the insurer may issue policies providing for the contingent liability of such of its subscribers as may acquire such policies in such state and need not extinguish the contingent liability applicable to policies theretofore in force in such state.\n\nHistory:Laws 1984, ch. 127, § 680.",

If the attorney fails to make up such deficiency or to make the assessment within thirty (30) days after the superintendent orders him to do so, or if the deficiency is not fully made up within sixty (60) days after the date the assessment was made, the insurer shall be deemed insolvent and shall be proceeded against as authorized by the Insurance Code.\n\nC.
