Att'y Gen. No. 62-57.\n\nSales outside state.— As to sales consummated outside the state, the governing language is that portion of this section which provides that no unlicensed person shall \"sell or propose to sell to the public in this state\" any insurance securities. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-57.\n\nComplete regulation of insurance securities for superintendent.— An analysis of the Securities Act (former 58-13-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.) and this act (former 59-13-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.) leads to the conclusion that the legislature intended for the superintendent of insurance to have complete regulation over the sale of insurance company securities. 1969 Op.
