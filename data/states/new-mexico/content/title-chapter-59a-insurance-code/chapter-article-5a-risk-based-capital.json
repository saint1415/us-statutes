On or before March 1 each year, every domestic insurer and health organization shall prepare and submit to the superintendent a report of its risk-based capital levels as of December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, in a form and containing such information as is required by the risk-based capital instructions. In addition, every domestic insurer and health organization shall file its risk-based capital report with:\n\n(1) the national association of insurance commissioners in accordance with the risk-based capital instructions; and\n\n(2) the insurance commissioner of each state in which the insurer or health organization is authorized to do business, if the insurance commissioner for that state has notified the insurer or health organization of the request in writing. The insurer or health organization shall file a copy of its risk-based capital report with each commissioner not later than March 1 each year or fifteen days from receipt of the notice, whichever is later.\n\nB. A life or health insurer's or a fraternal benefit society's risk-based capital shall be determined in accordance with the formula in the risk-based capital instructions. The formula shall take into account and may adjust for the covariance among the following factors:\n\n(1) asset risk;\n\n(2) the risk of adverse insurance experience with respect to the insurer's liabilities and obligations;\n\n(3) the interest rate risk with respect to the insurer's business; and\n\n(4) all other business risks and other relevant risks set forth in the risk-based capital instructions.\n\nC.

Capital in excess of the amount produced by the risk-based capital requirements contained in the Risk-Based Capital Act and formulas, schedules and instructions referenced in the Risk-Based Capital Act is desirable in the business of insurance. Additional capital is used and useful in the insurance business and helps to secure an insurer or health organization against various risks inherent in, or affecting, the business of insurance and not accounted for or only partially measured by the risk-based capital requirements contained in the Risk-Based Capital Act. Accordingly, insurers and health organizations should seek to maintain capital above the risk-based capital levels required by that act.\n\nE. If a domestic insurer or health organization files a risk-based capital report that in the superintendent's judgment is inaccurate, then the superintendent shall adjust the risk-based capital report to correct the inaccuracy and shall notify the insurer or health organization of the adjustment.

Nothing in this section shall be construed as a grant of privilege or confidentiality or a bar to production of that information by an insurer in a civil suit, whether or not the office of superintendent of insurance is a party.\n\nB. To assist in the performance of the superintendent's duties, the superintendent may:\n\n(1) share documents, materials or other information, including the confidential and privileged documents, materials or information identified in Subsection A of this section, with other state, federal and international regulatory agencies, with the national association of insurance commissioners, its affiliates or its subsidiaries and with state, federal and international law enforcement authorities if the recipient agrees in writing to maintain the confidentiality and privilege of the documents, materials or other information;\n\n(2) receive documents, materials or information, including otherwise confidential and privileged documents, materials or information, from the national association of insurance commissioners, its affiliates or its subsidiaries and from regulatory and law enforcement officials of foreign or domestic jurisdictions, except that the superintendent shall maintain as confidential or privileged documents, materials or other information received with notice or the understanding that the content is confidential or privileged pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction from which the information originates; and\n\n(3) enter into agreements governing the sharing and use of information that are consistent with this subsection.\n\nC. The comparison of an insurer's or health organization's total adjusted capital to any of its risk-based capital levels is a regulatory tool that may indicate the need for possible corrective action by the superintendent with respect to the insurer or health organization and is not intended as a means to rank insurers or health organizations generally or to compare insurers or health organizations for marketing purposes. Use of such comparisons for such purposes is inherently misleading and deceptive.

The risk-based capital instructions, risk-based capital reports, adjusted risk-based capital reports, risk-based capital plans and revised risk-based capital plans are intended solely for use by the superintendent in monitoring the solvency of insurers and health organizations and the need for possible corrective action with respect to insurers and health organizations.
