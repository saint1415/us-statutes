The amendments enacted by Laws 2011, ch. 127, § 10 and Laws 2011, ch. 156, § 4 are described below. To view the session laws in their entirety,seethe 2011 session laws onNMOneSource.com.\n\nLaws 2011, ch. 156, § 4, effective June 17, 2011, exempted insurance from the application of Chapter 59A, Article 14 NMSA 1978 when New Mexico is not the home state of the insured.\n\nLaws 2011, ch. 127, § 10, effective July 1, 2011, eliminated the limitation on the application of Chapter 59A, Article 14 NMSA 1978 to reinsurance placed by general lines agents and surplus lines brokers.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2011, ch. 156, § 11 provided that the provisions §§ 3 through 10 of Laws 2011, ch. 156 are applicable to insurance policies issued on or after July 21, 2011.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective April 3, 1991, substituted \"Chapter 59A, Article 14 NMSA 1978\" for \"This article\" at the beginning of Subsections A and B; substituted \"Chapter 59A, Article 15 NMSA 1978\" for \"Article 15 of the Insurance Code\" at the end in Subsection A; in Subsection B, substituted \"Section 59A-7-5 NMSA 1978\" for \"Section 111 of the Insurance Code\" at the end of Paragraph (1), added Paragraph (6) and made a related stylistic change; added Subsection C; and made a minor stylistic change in Subsection A.\n\nMiscommunication may result in coverage despite exclusion.— Since the surplus lines insurer authorized a surplus lines broker to issue insurance, the insurer must assume responsibility for inadequate insurance coverage resulting from miscommunications made between intermediaries during the process of selling insurance to the insured. Since the insured initially sought coverage for a particular injury, the insured's damages are covered under the policy notwithstanding an exclusion for that particular injury.Barth v.
