Installment fees are associated with the privilege of paying a premium in installments and are not for the actual purchase of insurance itself.Nakashima v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 2007-NMCA-027, 141 N.M. 239, 153 P.3d 664.\n\nInstallment payment fees were not premiums.— Where the insurer offered policies with a six-month term and required payment of the premium in a lump sum for the entire term; the insurer required policyholders who wanted to pay premiums in monthly installments to enter into a premium payment agreement with a separate corporation before the insurer would issue a policy that allowed monthly payments; the payee corporation imposed a monthly service charge to cover the increased costs of monthly billing and payment; the payee corporation's monthly bills reflected the service charge as an amount separate from and in addition to the monthly installment of the prorated lump-sum premium; and the policy included an endorsement amending the policy period to one calendar month, continuing for successive monthly periods, if the premium was paid when due, the monthly service charge was not a premium.Nellis v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Ariz., 2012-NMCA-020, 272 P.3d 143, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-011..\n\nInstallment payment fees were supported by consideration.— Where the insurer offered policies with a six-month term and required payment of the premium in a lump sum for the entire term; the insurer allowed policyholders who wanted to pay premiums in monthly installments to enter into a premium payment agreement with a separate corporation; the payee corporation imposed a monthly service charge to cover the increased costs of monthly billing and payment; and the policy that allowed monthly payments included an endorsement amending the policy period to one calendar month, continuing for successive monthly periods, if the premium was paid when due, the monthly service charge was supported by consideration.Nellis v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Ariz., 2012-NMCA-020, 272 P.3d 143, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-011.\n\nParol evidence rule did not prevent enforcement of premium payment agreement.— Where the insurer required policyholders who wanted to pay premiums in monthly installments to enter into a premium payment agreement with a separate corporation before the insurer would issue a policy that allowed monthly payments; the payee corporation imposed a monthly service charge to cover the increased costs of monthly billing and payment; the policy issued by the insurer did not specify any service charge to be paid by policyholders who bought insurance on a monthly basis; although the policy declaration provided that no fees were payable with respect to the policy, it referred to the premium payment agreement with the payee corporation; and the policy included a merger clause and an endorsement amending the policy period to one calendar month, continuing for successive monthly periods if the premium was paid when due, the policy was only partially integrated and the parol evidence rule did not prevent the proof and enforcement of the premium payment agreement.Nellis v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Ariz., 2012-NMCA-020, 272 P.3d 143, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-011.\n\nStacking.— When an automobile insurance policy states that premiums for uninsured motorist coverage with respect to additional vehicles under the policy are included in another premium, a reasonable insured might understand that more than one premium is charged, more than one coverage is purchased, and that stacking would be permitted. Since an insurer conceptualizes and drafts the insurance contract, the insurer has an obligation to express clearly its intent not to allow stacking, to its agents who sell the policy and, more importantly, to the insureds to whom it issues the agreements it prepares.Rodriguez v. Windsor Ins. Co., 1994-NMSC-075, 118 N.M. 127, 879 P.2d 759.",

Foundation Reserve Ins. Co., 1967-NMSC-094, 77 N.M. 661, 427 P.2d 21.\n\nRegardless of intent.— Action for death benefit under certificate of fraternal benefit insurance was defeated by fact that insured, being then pregnant and afterward dying as result thereof, falsely, though innocently, warranted in application for insurance that she was not pregnant.Vigil v. American Ins. Union, 1932-NMSC-065, 37 N.M. 44, 17 P.2d 936.\n\nRepresentation or concealment of fact is materialif it operates as an inducement to the insurer to enter into the contract, where, except for such inducement, it would not have done so, or would have charged a higher premium.Modisette v. Foundation Reserve Ins. Co., 1967-NMSC-094, 77 N.M. 661, 427 P.2d 21.\n\nWhen it is determined that the insurer's conduct would not have been altered in either accepting the risk, or in the premium that would have been charged, the conclusion follows that the policy should not be cancelled for fraud.Tsosie v. Foundation Reserve Ins. Co., 1967-NMSC-095, 77 N.M. 671, 427 P.2d 29.\n\nEffect of insurer's agent's misstatement.— Insurer is not relieved from liability by reason of misstatements as to health of insured in application made out by insurer's agent and signed by insured without reading, though copy of application, as required by statute, is attached to policy when delivered, and was not read by insured.Griego v. New York Life Ins. Co., 1940-NMSC-029, 44 N.M. 330, 102 P.2d 31.\n\nEffect of agent's disregard of information.— Aside from any question which may be present as to the effect of the failure of insurer's agent to make further inquiry to avoid being misled, the agent's disregard of the information that was given may properly be considered by the court in determining the issue of materiality and reliance.Tsosie v. Foundation Reserve Ins. Co., 1967-NMSC-095, 77 N.M. 671, 427 P.2d 29.\n\nMateriality is factual question.— The question of materiality or reliance by the defendant ordinarily is for the trier of facts, and the burden of proof is on the insurance company.Tsosie v. Foundation Reserve Ins. Co., 1967-NMSC-095, 77 N.M. 671, 427 P.2d 29.\n\nKnowledge prerequisite to waiver or estoppel.— An insurer may waive its right to assert a forfeiture, or be estopped from asserting this right. Before an insurer can be held to have waived, or be estopped from asserting a right of forfeiture, it must have had knowledge of the facts.Modisette v. Foundation Reserve Ins.

In defining the essential health benefits pursuant to Subsection B of this section, the superintendent shall:\n\n(1) ensure that such essential health benefits reflect an appropriate balance among the categories described in that subsection, so that benefits are not unduly weighted toward any category;\n\n(2) not make coverage decisions, determine reimbursement rates, establish incentive programs or design benefits in ways that discriminate against individuals because of their age, disability or expected length of life;\n\n(3) take into account the health care needs of diverse segments of the population, including women, children, persons with disabilities and other groups;\n\n(4) ensure that health benefits established as essential not be subject to denial to individuals against their wishes on the basis of the individual's age or expected length of life or of the individual's present or predicted disability, degree of medical dependency or quality of life;\n\n(5) provide that if a plan is offered through the New Mexico health insurance exchange, another health insurance plan offered through the New Mexico health insurance exchange shall not fail to be treated as a qualified health plan solely because the plan does not offer coverage of benefits offered through the standalone plan that are otherwise required; and\n\n(6) periodically update the essential health benefits under Subsection B of this section to address any gaps in access to coverage or changes in the evidence base identified by the superintendent.\n\nD. A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering a group or individual health insurance plan shall not establish a restricted lifetime or annual limit on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary with respect to benefits that are essential health benefits, as determined by the superintendent. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to prevent a group health plan or health insurance plan from placing annual or lifetime per-beneficiary limits on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits, to the extent that these limits are otherwise permitted under federal or state law.\n\nE. The superintendent shall adopt and promulgate rules specifying the maximum cost-sharing amounts for which an insured may be held liable for payment of covered benefits under any health insurance plan that provides benefits other than excepted benefits, including deductibles, coinsurance, copayments or similar charge, and any other expenditure required of an insured individual with respect to essential health benefits covered under the plan, but not including premiums, balance billing amounts for non-network providers or spending for non-covered services.\n\nF.

The provisions of Subsection G of this section shall not be construed to prohibit a health insurance plan or health insurance issuer from providing coverage for services in addition to those recommended by the United States preventive services task force or to deny coverage for services that are not described in this section. The superintendent shall establish by rule a minimum interval between the date on which a recommendation described in Paragraphs (1) and (2) of Subsection G of this section or a guideline under Paragraph (3) of Subsection G of this section is issued and the plan year with respect to which the requirement described in Subsection G of this section is effective with respect to the service described in such recommendation or guideline; provided that the interval shall not be less than one year from the date the federal recommendation or guideline is published.\n\nI. If a health insurance plan is offered as a qualified health plan through the New Mexico health insurance exchange, the insurer offering the qualified health plan shall also offer that plan through the health insurance exchange as a plan that restricts enrollment to individuals who, as of the beginning of a plan year, have not attained the age of twenty-one years.\n\nJ.

An insurer or agent may at any time cancel a policy for nonpayment of premium when due, whether the premium is payable directly to the insurer or agent or indirectly under any premium financing plan or extension of credit. The insurer or agent shall give the named insured written notice of the cancellation not less than ten days prior to the effective date of the cancellation.\n\nB. An insurer may cancel its policy without cause at any time within sixty days following original issuance and effective date of the policy. The insurer shall give the named insured written notice of the cancellation not less than ten days prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which effective date shall fall within the sixty-day period.\n\nC. Subject to Subsection A of this section, after expiration of the sixty-day period referred to in Subsection B of this section, an insurer or agent shall not cancel except for reasonable cause such policies and for such causes, and with advance notice of cancellation for such period of time, as may from time to time be provided by rules and regulations of the superintendent. Such rules and regulations may also require that statement of the reasons for cancellation be contained in the notice of cancellation given to specified persons.\n\nD. Notice of cancellation shall be given using any communication method authorized by the named insured, or by personal delivery to the named insured or by mailing the notice postage-paid addressed to the named insured at the address last of record with the insurer. Notice so mailed shall be deemed given when deposited in a mail depository of the United States post office.\n\nE. There shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action shall arise against an insurer or other person for furnishing information as to reasons for cancellation or for a statement made or information given pursuant to this section.\n\nF. This section shall not apply as to life insurance or annuity contracts, health insurance contracts, title insurance, inland marine insurance contracts, or to an insurance policy that by its terms is not cancellable during the term of the policy at the option of the insurer.\n\nHistory:Laws 1984, ch. 127, § 358; 2021, ch. 108, § 15.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective July 1, 2021, clarified that notice of cancellation shall be delivered using any communication method authorized by the named insured; and in Subsection D, after \"Notice of cancellation\", changed \"may\" to \"shall\", and after \"be given\", added \"using any communication method authorized by the named insured\".\n\nReasonable cause required.— This section does not preclude an insurer from cancelling insurance after sixty days, but requires only that reasonable cause exists for cancellation. Neither does it mandate that the insurer give notice of what the reasonable cause is. Notification of reasonable cause for termination is not a statutory requirement.Corbin v. State Farm Ins. Co., 1990-NMSC-014, 109 N.M. 589, 788 P.2d 345.\n\nCommon-law duty to avoid terminating policy.— An employer owes a common-law duty of good faith and due care to employees in attending a group insurance policy secured for the benefit of the employees. This duty requires the employer perform whatever functions are reasonable and necessary in order to keep the policy in effect, and that the employer avoid terminating the insurance policy or allowing it to lapse contrary to the desires and intentions of the employees. Notice of cancellation to the employee is not required, however, when the basis for the cancellation is nonpayment by the employee.Chavez v. American Life & Cas. Ins. Co., 1994-NMSC-037, 117 N.M. 393, 872 P.2d 366.\n\nStatutory requirement of 10-day notice of cancellation does not apply to life insurance.— It is only the phrase \"to any insurance policy\" that is limited by the concluding language in Subsection F.Chavez v. American Life & Cas. Ins. Co., 1994-NMSC-037, 117 N.M. 393, 872 P.2d 366.\n\nNo notice required before coverage laspes.— The failure of an insured to pay a renewal premium by the due date results in a lapse of coverage as of the last day of the policy period; under those circumstances, statutory requirement for 10-day notifications of cancellation does not apply.Guaranty Nat'l Ins. Co. v. C de Baca, 1995-NMCA-130, 120 N.M. 806, 907 P.2d 210, cert. denied, 120 N.M. 715, 905 P.2d 1119.\n\nProvision that notice is deemed given when deposited in the mailin Subsection D did not apply to a rejection notice of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.Kaiser v. DeCarrera, 1996-NMSC-050, 122 N.M. 221, 923 P.2d 588.\n\nLiability of insurer to third persons.— Where an insurer canceled a trucker's insurance policy in accordance with this section, the cancellation terminated the liability of the insurer not only with respect to the insured, but also with respect to third persons who were creditors of the insured and who brought garnishment proceedings against the insurer.Howard v. Guaranty Nat'l Ins. Co., 1999-NMCA-121, 128 N.M. 79, 989 P.2d 896, cert. deniedsub nom., Howard v. Quality Xpress, Inc., 128 N.M. 148, 990 P.2d 822.\n\nAm.
