The compensation of the special deputies, counsel, clerks or assistants and all expenses of taking possession of the delinquent insurer and of conducting the delinquency proceedings shall be fixed by the receiver, subject to the approval of the court, and shall be paid out of the funds or assets of the insurer.

Upon the issuance of an order of liquidation with a finding of insolvency against a domestic insurer, the superintendent shall make application to the court requesting authority to disburse funds to the life insurance guaranty association or the property and casualty insurance guaranty association, as applicable, from time to time out of the insurer's marshalled assets as funds become available in amounts equal to disbursements made by the association for claims handling expense and covered claims obligations on the presentation of evidence that such disbursements have been made by the guaranty association.

The superintendent in determining the amounts available for disbursements to the life insurance guaranty association or property and casualty insurance guaranty association, as applicable, and similar associations or funds in other states shall reserve sufficient assets for the payment of the expenses of administration. The superintendent shall establish procedures for the ratable allocation of disbursements to the life insurance guaranty association or property and casualty insurance guaranty association and similar associations or funds in other states, and shall secure from the life insurance guaranty association or property and casualty guaranty association and each eligible similar association or fund in other states as a condition to advances in reimbursement of covered claims obligations and claim handling expenses, an agreement to return to the superintendent on demand funds previously advanced as may be required to pay the expenses of administration.\n\nHistory:Laws 1984, ch. 127, § 710.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and it is not part of the law.\n\nAm.

For the purposes of Sections 59A-41-25 and 59A-41-26 NMSA 1978, an insurer may be deemed to be in a hazardous financial condition when the superintendent has determined, after notice and hearing, that the loss experience of the insurer, when reviewed in conjunction with the kinds and characteristics of risks insured, or the insurer's financial condition, or its ownership, or the ratio of its annual premium volume in relation to its policyholders' surplus, would make further assumption of risks by the insurer hazardous to those persons doing business with the insurer or to the general public.\n\nB. The following items may be considered by the superintendent to determine whether the continued operation of an insurer transacting an insurance business in New Mexico is hazardous to the policyholders, the creditors or the general public:\n\n(1) adverse findings reported in financial condition and market conduct examination reports, audit reports and actuarial opinions, reports or summaries;\n\n(2) the national association of insurance commissioners insurance regulatory information system and its other financial analysis solvency tools and reports;\n\n(3) ratios of commission expense, general insurance expense, policy benefits and reserve increases to annual premium and net investment income;\n\n(4) whether, according to currently accepted actuarial standards of practice, the insurer has made adequate provision for the anticipated cash flows required by the insurer's contractual obligations and related expenses, when considered in light of the insurer's assets and investment earnings on assets held for reserves and related actuarial items and the considerations anticipated to be received and retained through the insurer's policies and contracts;\n\n(5) the ability of an assuming reinsurer to perform and whether the insurer's reinsurance program provides sufficient protection for the insurer's remaining surplus after taking into account the insurer's cash flow and the classes of business written as well as the financial condition of the assuming reinsurer;\n\n(6) whether the insurer's operating loss in the last twelve-month period or any shorter period of time, including net capital gain or loss, change in non-admitted assets and cash dividends paid to shareholders is greater than fifty percent of the insurer's remaining surplus as regards policyholders in excess of the minimum required;\n\n(7) whether the insurer's operating loss, excluding net capital gains, in the last twelve months or a shorter period of time is greater than twenty percent of the insurer's remaining surplus as regards policyholders in excess of the minimum required;\n\n(8) whether a reinsurer, an obligor or an entity within the insurer's insurance holding company system is insolvent, threatened with insolvency or delinquent in payment of its monetary or other obligations and that, in the superintendent's opinion, might affect the solvency of the insurer;\n\n(9) contingent liabilities, pledges or guaranties that individually or collectively involve a total amount that, in the superintendent's opinion, may affect the solvency of the insurer;\n\n(10) whether any person having control of an insurer is delinquent in transmitting or paying net premiums to the insurer;\n\n(11) the age and collectibility of receivables;\n\n(12) whether the management of an insurer, including officers, directors or any other person who directly or indirectly controls the operation of the insurer, fails to possess and demonstrate the competence, fitness and reputation deemed necessary to serve the insurer in such position;\n\n(13) whether management of an insurer has failed to respond to inquiries relative to the condition of the insurer or has furnished false or misleading information concerning an inquiry;\n\n(14) whether the insurer, for a reason not satisfactory to the superintendent, has failed to meet financial and holding company filing requirements;\n\n(15) whether management of an insurer has filed with any regulatory authority or released to lending institutions or to the general public any false or misleading financial statements or has made a false or misleading entry or has omitted an entry of material amount in the books of the insurer;\n\n(16) whether the insurer has grown so rapidly and to such an extent that it lacks adequate financial and administrative capacity to meet its obligations in a timely manner;\n\n(17) whether the insurer has experienced or will experience in the foreseeable future cash flow or liquidity problems;\n\n(18) whether management of the insurer has established reserves that do not meet the minimum standards established by New Mexico's insurance laws and rules and by statutory accounting standards, sound actuarial principles and standards of practice;\n\n(19) whether management of the insurer persistently engages in material under-reserving that results in adverse development;\n\n(20) whether transactions among affiliates, subsidiaries or controlling persons for which the insurer receives assets or capital gains, or both, do not provide sufficient value, liquidity or diversity to ensure that the insurer can meet its outstanding obligations as they mature;\n\n(21) risk-based capital reports and other information obtained pursuant to the Risk-Based Capital Act [Chapter 59A, Article 5A NMSA 1978]; or\n\n(22) such other material information and data as the superintendent may deem relevant.\n\nC. For the purposes of making a determination of an insurer's financial condition under this section, the superintendent may:\n\n(1) disregard any credit or amount receivable resulting from transactions with a reinsurer that is insolvent, impaired or otherwise subject to a delinquency proceeding;\n\n(2) make appropriate adjustments, including disallowance, to asset values attributable to investments in or transactions with parents, subsidiaries or affiliates that are consistent with the national association of insurance commissioners' accounting practices and procedures manual and with state laws and rules;\n\n(3) refuse to recognize the stated value of accounts receivable if the ability to collect receivables is highly speculative in view of the age of the account or the financial condition of the debtor; or\n\n(4) increase the insurer's liability in an amount equal to any contingent liability, pledge or guarantee not otherwise included if there is a substantial risk that the insurer will be called upon to meet the obligation undertaken within the next twelve-month period.\n\nHistory:Laws 1984, ch. 127, § 716; 1993, ch. 320, § 90; 1995, ch. 149, § 15; 2014, ch. 59, § 47.\n\nThe 2014 amendment,effective July 1, 2014, expanded the factors the superintendent may consider in determining a hazardous financial condition; in Subsection B, Paragraph (1), at the beginning of the sentence, added \"adverse\", and after \"examination reports\", added \"audit reports and actuarial opinions, reports or summaries\"; in Subsection B, Paragraph (2), after \"information system and its\", deleted \"related\" and added \"other financial analysis solvency tools and\"; in Subsection B, Paragraph (4), deleted the former language which permitted the superintendent to consider the value, liquidity or diversity of the insurer's asset portfolio in light of the current economic conditions with regard to the insurer's ability to meet outstanding obligations, and added the current language of the paragraph; in Subsection B, Paragraph (5), at the beginning of the sentence, after \"the\", deleted \"adequacy, reliability and soundness of\" and added \"ability of an assuming reinsurer to perform and whether\", after \"reinsurance program\", added \"provides sufficient protection for the insurer's remaining surplus after taking into account the insurer's cash flow and the classes of business written\", and after \"assuming reinsurer\", deleted \"and the ability of the assuming reinsurer to perform under its reinsurance agreements\"; in Subsection B, Paragraph (6), at the beginning of the sentence, added \"whether\", and after \"paid to shareholders\", deleted \"in comparison to such\" and added \"is greater than fifty percent of the\"; in Subsection B, added Paragraph (7); in Subsection B, Paragraph (8), after \"whether\", deleted \"any affiliate, subsidiary or\" and added \"a\", after \"reinsurer\", added \"an obligor or an entity within the insurer's insurance holding company system\", and after \"monetary or other\", deleted \"obligation\" and added \"obligations and that, in the superintendent's opinion, might affect the solvency of the insurer\"; in Subsection B, Paragraph (9), after \"pledges or guaranties\", deleted \"which\" and added \"that individually or collectively involve a total amount that, in the superintendent's opinion\"; in Subsection B, added Paragraphs (14), (18), (19) and (20); and in Subsection C, Paragraph (2), after \"appropriate adjustments\", added \"including disallowance\", and after \"subsidiaries and affiliates\", added the remainder of the sentence.\n\nSeverability.— Laws 2014, ch. 59, § 54 provided that if any part or application of the provisions of Laws 2014, ch. 59 is held invalid, the remainder or its application to other situations or persons shall not be affected.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, in Subsection B, added Paragraph (16) and redesignated former Paragraph (16) as Paragraph (17).\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, added the subsection \"A\" designation; in Subsection A, substituted \"Sections 59A-41-25 and 59A-41-26 NMSA 1978\" for \"Sections 717 and 718 of this article\" and substituted \"business with the insurer or to the general public\" for \"business with its insurer\"; and added Subsections B and C.\n\nAm.

Whenever the superintendent finds an insurer authorized to transact insurance in New Mexico to be in hazardous financial condition, as referred to in Section 59A-41-24 NMSA 1978, the superintendent may order the insurer to take such action as the superintendent deems reasonably necessary to rectify the hazardous condition, including requiring the insurer to:\n\n(1) reduce, suspend or limit the volume of business being accepted or renewed;\n\n(2) submit its reinsurance contracts for approval and make such further requirements as to the insurer's reinsurance arrangements as the superintendent deems necessary;\n\n(3) bulk-reinsure all or any part of its New Mexico business with another insurer authorized to transact such business in New Mexico;\n\n(4) increase the insurer's capital and surplus on such terms, in such amount and in such manner as the superintendent deems necessary;\n\n(5) maintain with the superintendent a special deposit in cash or securities eligible for investment of funds of a like domestic insurer under Chapter 59A, Article 9 NMSA 1978 and in amount not less than the lesser of:\n\n(a) the amounts required to be maintained as: 1) reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on New Mexico business; and 2) reserves for unearned premiums on New Mexico business.

Such a lien could not, however, become superior and such a purchase could not create superior rights for the purpose of Subsection B of this section through any acts subsequent to the obtaining of such a lien or subsequent to such a purchase which require the agreement or concurrence of any third party or which require any further judicial action or ruling.\n\nD. A transfer of property for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration which is deemed under Subsection B of this section to be made or suffered after the transfer because of delay in perfecting it does not thereby become a transfer for or on account of an antecedent debt if any acts required by the applicable law to be performed in order to perfect the transfer as against liens or bona fide purchasers' rights are performed within twenty-one days or any period expressly allowed by law, whichever is less. A transfer to secure a future loan, if such a loan is actually made, or a transfer which becomes security for a future loan, shall have the same effect as a transfer for [sic] on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration.\n\nE. If any lien deemed voidable under Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of this section has been dissolved by the furnishing of a bond or other obligation, the surety on which has been indemnified directly or indirectly by the transfer of or the creation of a lien upon any property of an insurer before the filing of a petition under Chapter 59A, Article 41 NMSA 1978 which results in a liquidation order, the indemnifying transfer or lien shall also be deemed voidable.\n\nF. The property affected by any lien deemed voidable under Subsections A and E of this section shall be discharged from such lien, and that property and any of the indemnifying property transferred to or for the benefit of a surety shall pass to the liquidator, except that the court may on due notice order any such lien to be preserved for the benefit of the estate and the court may direct that such conveyance be executed as may be proper or adequate to evidence the title of the liquidator.\n\nG. The court before which the rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding is pending shall have summary jurisdiction of any proceeding by the liquidator to hear and determine the rights of any parties under this section. Reasonable notice of any hearing in the proceeding shall be given to all parties in interest, including the obligee of a releasing bond or other like obligation. Where an order is entered for the recovery of indemnifying property in kind or for the avoidance of an indemnifying lien, the court, upon application of any party in interest, shall in the same proceeding ascertain the value of the property or lien, and if the value is less than the amount for which the property is indemnity or less than the amount of the lien, the transferee or lienholder may elect to retain the property or lien upon payment of its value, as ascertained by the court, to the rehabilitator or liquidator, within such reasonable times as the court shall fix.\n\nH. The liability of the surety under a releasing bond or other like obligation shall be discharged to the extent of the value of the indemnifying property recovered or the indemnifying lien nullified and avoided by the rehabilitator or liquidator, or where the property is retained under Subsection G of this section to the extent of the amount paid to the rehabilitator or liquidator.\n\nI. If a creditor has been preferred, and afterward in good faith gives the insurer further credit without security of any kind, for property which becomes a part of the insurer's estate, the amount of the new credit remaining unpaid at the time of the petition may be set off against the preference which would otherwise be recoverable from him.\n\nJ. If an insurer shall, directly or indirectly, within four months before the filing of a successful petition for rehabilitation or liquidation under Chapter 59A, Article 41 NMSA 1978, or at any time in contemplation of a delinquency proceeding, pay money or transfer property to an attorney-at-law for services rendered or to be rendered, the transactions may be examined by the court on its own motion or shall be examined by the court on petition of the rehabilitator or liquidator and shall be held valid only to the extent of a reasonable amount to be determined by the court, and the excess may be recovered by the rehabilitator or liquidator for the benefits of the estate; provided that where the attorney is in a position of influence in the insurer or an affiliate thereof payment of any money or the transfer of any property to the attorney-at-law for services rendered or to be rendered shall be governed by the provisions of Subparagraph (d) of Paragraph (2) of Subsection A.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 59A-41-43.1, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 320, § 94.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and it is not part of the law.",

Claims may not be cumulated by assignment to avoid application of the fifty dollar ($50.00) deductible provision. Subject to the fifty dollar ($50.00) deduction, every claim in each class shall be paid in full or adequate funds retained for payment before the members of the next class receive any payment. No subclasses shall be established within any class. Subject to the foregoing, the order of distribution and of priority shall be as follows:\n\nA. administration costs. The costs and expenses of administration, including but not limited to the actual and necessary costs of preserving or recovering the assets of the insurer, compensation for all services rendered in the liquidation, necessary filing fees, fees and mileage payable to witnesses, attorney's fees in reasonable amount and the reasonable expenses of a guaranty association for unallocated loss adjustment expense;\n\nB. wages. Debts due to employees of the insurer for services performed, not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) to each employee, and earned within three months before commencement of delinquency proceedings.

If a claimant files a claim and bases it both on the judgment and on the underlying facts, the claim shall be considered by the liquidator, who shall give the judgment such weight as he deems appropriate. The claim as allowed shall receive the priority it would receive in absence of the judgment. If the judgment is larger than the allowance on the underlying claim, the remaining portion of the judgment shall be treated as if it were a claim based solely on a judgment, except that, to the extent such judgment was obtained through fraud or collusion, it shall be disallowed;\n\nG. interest on claims already paid. Interest at the legal rate compounded annually on all claims in the classes under Subsections A through I of this section, from date of petition for liquidation or the date on which the claim becomes due, whichever is later, until the date on which the dividend is declared. The liquidator, with the court's approval, may make reasonable classifications of claims for purposes of computing interest, may make approximate computations and may ignore certain classifications and time periods as de minimis;\n\nH. miscellaneous subordinated claims.

The requested order may:\n\n(1) direct the superintendent to take possession and control of all or part of the property, books, accounts and records of the insurer and the premises occupied by it for transaction of its business in this state; and\n\n(2) until further order of the court, enjoin the insurer and its officers, managers, agents and employees from removal, concealment or other disposition of its property, and from transaction of its business, except with the superintendent's written consent.\n\nB. The court's order shall be for such duration, specified in the order, as the court deems necessary to enable the superintendent to ascertain the insurer's condition. On motion of any party or on its own motion, the court may hold such hearings as it deems desirable after such notice as it deems appropriate, and extend or shorten the duration or modify the terms of the order. The court shall vacate the seizure order if the superintendent fails to commence a formal proceeding under this article after reasonable opportunity to do so; and a seizure order is automatically terminated by issuance of the court's order pursuant to formal delinquency proceedings under this article.\n\nC. Entry of a seizure order under this section does not constitute an anticipatory breach of any contract of the insurer.\n\nHistory:Laws 1984, ch. 127, § 746.",

If it appears to the superintendent that the interests of policyholders, creditors or the public will be jeopardized by delay incident to requesting a court seizure order, then on any ground which would justify a court seizure order under Section 59A-41-54 NMSA 1978, and without notice and without applying to the court, the superintendent may issue a seizure order which must contain a statement verified by him of the grounds for his action. As directed by the seizure order, the superintendent's representatives shall forthwith take possession and control of all or part of the property, books, accounts and records of the insurer and of the premises in this state occupied by the insurer for transaction of its business. The superintendent shall retain possession and control until the order is vacated or is replaced by an order of court pursuant to Subsection B of this section, or pursuant to a formal proceeding under Chapter 59A, Article 41 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. At any time after seizure under Subsection A of this section, the insurer may apply to the district court for Santa Fe county. The court shall thereupon order the superintendent to appear forthwith and shall thereafter proceed as if the order were a court seizure order issued under Section 59A-41-54 NMSA 1978.\n\nC.
