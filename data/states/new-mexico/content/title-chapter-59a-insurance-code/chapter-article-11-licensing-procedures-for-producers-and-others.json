Nothing in this section shall be construed as a grant of privilege or confidentiality or a bar to production of that information by an insurer or the insurance producer in a civil suit, whether or not the superintendent is a party; provided that the superintendent may use the documents, materials or other information in a regulatory or legal action brought in the course of the superintendent's official duties. The documents, materials or other information shall not be made public by the superintendent or any other person, except to insurance departments of other states, unless the superintendent determines that the interests of the policyholders, shareholders or public will be served by the publication of them, in which case the superintendent may publish all or any part of them in the manner the superintendent deems appropriate;\n\n(2) in order to assist in the performance of the superintendent's duties, the superintendent may:\n\n(a) share documents, materials or other information, including the confidential documents, materials or information subject to this section, with other state, federal and international regulatory agencies, with the national association of insurance commissioners, its affiliates or subsidiaries and with state, federal and international law enforcement authorities; provided that the recipient agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the documents, materials or other information;\n\n(b) receive documents, materials or information, including otherwise confidential documents, materials or information from the national association of insurance commissioners, its affiliates or subsidiaries and from regulatory and law enforcement officials of other foreign or domestic jurisdictions, and shall maintain as confidential or privileged any document, material or information received with notice or the understanding that it is confidential or privileged under the laws of the jurisdiction that is the source of the document, material or information; and\n\n(c) enter into agreements governing sharing and use of information consistent with this subsection. The language in this subsection assumes the recipient has the authority to protect the applicable confidentiality or privilege, but does not address the verification of that authority that would presumably occur in the context of a broader information-sharing agreement;\n\n(3) no waiver of any privilege or claim of confidentiality in the documents, materials or information shall occur as a result of disclosure to the superintendent under this section or as a result of sharing as authorized in this section; and\n\n(4) nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the superintendent from releasing final adjudicated actions, including for-cause terminations that are open to public inspection pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act, to a database or other clearinghouse service maintained by the national association of insurance commissioners, its affiliates or subsidiaries of the national association of insurance commissioners.\n\nL.
