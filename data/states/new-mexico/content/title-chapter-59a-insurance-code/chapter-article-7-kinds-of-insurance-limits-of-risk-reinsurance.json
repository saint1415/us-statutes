An insurer authorized to transact casualty insurance may write accident and health insurance as those terms are defined in Section 59A-7-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:Laws 1984, ch. 127, § 112; 1978 Comp., § 59A-7-6, repealed and reenacted by Laws 2016, ch. 89, § 8; 2017, ch. 130, § 6.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 2016, ch. 89, § 8 repealed 59A-7-6 NMSA 1978, and enacted a new section, effective July 1, 2017.\n\nThe 2017 amendment,effective July 1, 2017, allowed casualty insurers to write accident and health insurance; added subsection designation \"A.\" and redesignated former Subsections A through DDD as Paragraphs A(1) through A(56), respectively; and added a new Subsection B.\n\nSeverability.— Laws 2016, ch. 89, § 71 provided that if any part or application of Laws 2016, ch. 89 is held invalid, the remainder or its application to other situations or persons shall not be affected.\n\nMeaning of the word \"sudden\" in a pollution exclusion provision.— Where plaintiff mining company incurred liability for environmental contamination that occurred over a period of years; plaintiff's liability insurance policies excluded coverage for damage caused by pollution or contamination unless the discharges were \"sudden and accidental\"; the policies did not define the word \"sudden\" or the phrase \"sudden and accidental\"; the court considered other provisions of the policies, dictionary definitions, opinions of other courts, industry practice, and the drafting history of the exclusion provision by the insurance industry to evaluate whether the word \"sudden\" was ambiguous; and based on the court's consideration of the extrinsic evidence, the court concluded that the word \"sudden\" as used in the policies was ambiguous, the court resolved the ambiguity against the defendant insurer and held that as a matter of law, the word \"sudden\" as used in the exclusion provision meant \"unexpected\", rather than indicating a temporal limitation on the occurrence.United Nuclear Corp. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2012-NMSC-032, 285 P.3d 644,rev'g2011-NMCA-039, 149 N.M. 574, 252 P.3d 798.\n\nMeaning of \"sudden\" in qualified pollution exclusion provision.— Where a liability insurance policy excluded coverage for property damage or personal injury caused by pollution unless the pollution was \"sudden and accidental\", the term \"sudden\" means quick, abrupt or a temporary shot period of time.United Nuclear Corp. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2011-NMCA-039, 149 N.M. 574, 252 P.3d 798, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.\n\nFederal regulations define terms in aircraft insurance policies.— Aircraft insurance policies are not ambiguous where they fail to define the terms \"airworthiness certificate,\" \"airworthiness certification\" and \"full force and effect\" because when insurance policies are clearly within the context of aviation, the pertinent federal aviation regulations which define these terms apply.Security Mut. Cas. Co. v. O'Brien, 1983-NMSC-035, 99 N.M. 638, 662 P.2d 639.\n\nIntent to harm can be inferred.— With regard to whether sexual assault is the kind of intentional act to which liability insurance does not apply, the insured's intent to harm can be inferred as a matter of law.Sena v.
