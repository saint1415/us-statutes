Its authority to conduct one or more businesses shall not be limited by its status as a subsidiary of a domestic insurer.\n\nB. In addition to investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities permitted pursuant to the Insurance Holding Company Law, a domestic insurer may also invest:\n\n(1) in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities of one or more subsidiaries, amounts that do not exceed the lesser of ten percent of the insurer's assets or fifty percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders; provided that after the investments, the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.

For the purpose of this paragraph, \"the total investment of the insurer\" includes:\n\n(a) any direct investment by the insurer in an asset; and\n\n(b) the insurer's proportionate share of any investment in an asset by any subsidiary of the insurer, which shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the subsidiary's investment by the percentage of the ownership of the subsidiary; or\n\n(3) with the approval of the superintendent, any greater amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations or other securities of one or more subsidiaries; provided that after the investment, the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.\n\nC. Investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations or other securities of subsidiaries made pursuant to Subsection B of this section shall not be subject to any of the otherwise applicable restrictions or prohibitions contained in the Insurance Code applicable to the investments of the insurer.\n\nD. Whether any investment pursuant to Subsection B of this section meets the applicable requirements of that subsection shall be determined before the investment is made by calculating the applicable investment limitations as though the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the day they were made, net of any return of capital invested and not including dividends.\n\nE. If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of any investment made in it pursuant to this section within three years from the time of the cessation of control or within such further time as the superintendent may prescribe, unless at any time after the investment is made, the investment meets the requirements for investment under any other section of the Insurance Code and the insurer has so notified the superintendent.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 59A-37-3, enacted by Laws 1993, ch. 320, § 72; 2001, ch. 90, § 2; 2014, ch. 59, § 30.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1993, ch. 320, § 72 repealed former 59A-37-3 NMSA 1978, as enacted by Laws 1984, ch. 127, § 618, relating to the purpose of Article 37, and enacted a new section, effective June 18, 1993.\n\nCross references.— For the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,see15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq.\n\nFor the Investment Company Act of 1940,see15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq.\n\nThe 2014 amendment,effective July 1, 2014, removed restrictions on the type of subsidiaries a domestic insurer may organize or acquire; in Subsection A, after the first sentence, deleted \"engaged in the following kinds of business\" and added the second and third sentences; in Subsection A, deleted former Paragraphs (1) through (12), which listed the types of business transactions in which subsidiaries were authorized to engage; in Subsection B, after \"permitted pursuant to the\", deleted \"federal\", and after \"insurer may also\", added \"invest\"; in Subsection B, Paragraph (1), in the first sentence, deleted \"invest\", and in the second sentence, after \"foreign insurance subsidiaries\", added \"and health maintenance organizations\"; in Subsection B, Paragraph (2), in the first sentence, deleted \"invest\"; and in Subsection B, Paragraph (3), deleted \"invest\".\n\nSeverability.— Laws 2014, ch. 59, § 54 provided that if any part or application of the provisions of Laws 2014, ch. 59 is held invalid, the remainder or its application to other situations or persons shall not be affected.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, inserted \"federal\" preceding the act names in Paragraphs A(4), A(5) and Subsection B, and deleted \"including, but not limited to, actuarial, loss prevention, safety engineering, data processing, accounting, claims, appraisal and collection services\" from the end of Paragraph A(7).\n\nAm.

The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and any person in its holding company system, including amendments and modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed pursuant to this section that are subject to the materiality standards of this subsection, may not be entered into unless the insurer has notified the superintendent in writing of its intention to enter into such transactions at least thirty days prior thereto, or such shorter period as the superintendent may permit, and the superintendent has not disapproved it within that period:\n\n(1) sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, guarantees or investments, provided the transactions are equal to or exceed:\n\n(a) with respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five percent of surplus as regards policyholders as of the most recent December 31; or\n\n(b) with respect to life insurers, three percent of the insurer's admitted assets as of the most recent December 31;\n\n(2) loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate, where the insurer makes loans or extensions of credit with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of the transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of credit to, to purchase assets of, or to make investments in, any affiliate of the insurer making the loans or extensions of credit, provided the transactions are equal to or exceed:\n\n(a) with respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five percent of surplus as regards policyholders as of the most recent December 31; or\n\n(b) with respect to life insurers, three percent of the insurer's admitted assets as of December 31 next preceding;\n\n(3) reinsurance agreements or modifications to those agreements, including reinsurance pooling agreements or agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities, or projected reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next three years, equals or exceeds five percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as of the most recent December 31, including those agreements that may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a non-affiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and non-affiliate that any portion of such assets will be transferred to one or more affiliates of the insurer;\n\n(4) all management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation agreements, guarantees and cost-sharing arrangements;\n\n(5) guarantees made by a domestic insurer if the amount of the guarantee can be quantified and is greater than one-half of one percent of the insurer's admitted assets or ten percent of surplus as regards policyholders as of the most recent December 31, whichever is less.

A domestic insurer may not enter into transactions that are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the superintendent determines that such separate transactions were entered into over any twelve-month period for that purpose, the superintendent may exercise authority under Section 59A-37-26 NMSA 1978.\n\nD. The superintendent, in reviewing transactions pursuant to Subsection B of this section, shall consider whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in Subsection A of this section and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.\n\nE.

Any officer, director or employee of an insurance holding company system who willfully and knowingly subscribes to or makes or causes to be made any false statements or false reports or false filings with the intent to deceive the superintendent in the performance of the superintendent's duties under the Insurance Holding Company Law, upon conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned for not more than twenty years or fined not more than one million dollars ($1,000,000), or both. Any fines imposed shall be paid by the officer, director or employee in the officer's, director's or employee's individual capacity.\n\nF.

If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a domestic insurer has been entered for any reason, the receiver appointed under such order shall have a right to recover on behalf of the insurer:\n\n(1) from any parent corporation or holding company or person or affiliate who otherwise controlled the insurer, the amount of distributions, other than distributions of shares of the same class of stock, paid by the insurer on its capital stock;\n\n(2) any payment in the form of a bonus, termination settlement or extraordinary lump-sum salary adjustment made by the insurer or its subsidiary to a director, officer or employee; or\n\n(3) any payment on a surplus note entered into pursuant to Section 59A-34-23 NMSA 1978, where the distribution or payment pursuant to Paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection is made at any time during the two years preceding the petition for liquidation, conservation or rehabilitation, as the case may be, subject to the limitations of Subsections C, D, and E of this section.\n\nC. No such distribution shall be recoverable if the parent or affiliate shows that when paid, the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.\n\nD. Any person who was a parent corporation or holding company or a person who otherwise controlled the insurer or affiliate at the time such distributions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions or payments under Subsection B of this section which the person received.

      "text": "A. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"acquisition\" means an agreement, arrangement or activity whose consummation results in a person directly or indirectly acquiring the control of another person and includes the acquisition of voting securities, the acquisition of assets, bulk reinsurance and mergers; and\n\n(2) \"involved insurer\" includes an insurer that acquires or is acquired, is affiliated with an acquirer or acquired or is the result of a merger.\n\nB. Except as provided in this subsection, this section applies to an acquisition in which there is a change of control of an insurer authorized to do business in New Mexico. This section does not apply to:\n\n(1) a purchase of securities made solely for investment purposes if the securities are not used by voting or otherwise to cause or attempt to cause the substantial lessening of competition in an insurance market in New Mexico. If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control as provided in Subsection C of Section 59A-37-2 NMSA 1978, this section applies to the purchase unless the insurance supervisory official of the insurer's state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist and the domiciliary insurance supervisory official communicates that disclaimer action or affirmative finding to the superintendent;\n\n(2) the acquisition of a person by another person when both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance, if the acquisition would otherwise not be excluded from this section by the provisions of another paragraph of this subsection and if the acquiring party to the acquisition files with the superintendent a notification in accordance with Paragraph (1) of Subsection C of this section at least thirty days prior to the proposed effective date of the acquisition;\n\n(3) the acquisition of an already affiliated person;\n\n(4) where \"market\" means the direct written insurance premium in New Mexico for a line of business contained in the annual statement required to be filed by an insurer licensed to do business in New Mexico, an acquisition if, as an immediate result of the acquisition:\n\n(a) the combined market share of the involved insurers would not exceed five percent of the total market in any market;\n\n(b) no market share would increase; or\n\n(c) the combined market share of the involved insurers would not exceed twelve percent, and the market share would not increase by more than two percent, of the total market in any market;\n\n(5) an acquisition for which a pre-acquisition notification would be required by the provisions of this section solely because of its effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business; and\n\n(6) an acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary insurance supervisory official finds that the insurer is in failing condition, that there is no feasible way to improve the condition and that the benefit to the public of improving the insurer's condition through the acquisition exceeds the benefit to the public that would arise from not lessening competition; provided that the findings are communicated to the superintendent by the domiciliary insurance supervisory official.\n\nC. An acquisition identified in Subsection B of this section may be subject to an order pursuant to Subsection E of this section, unless the acquiring person files a pre-acquisition notification and the waiting period has expired. The acquired person may file a pre-acquisition notification. The superintendent shall treat as confidential information submitted pursuant to this subsection in the same manner as provided in Section 59A-37-24 NMSA 1978.\n\n(1) Pre-acquisition notification shall contain the information and be in the form prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners relating to the markets that, pursuant to Paragraph (4) of Subsection B of this section, subject the acquisition to the provisions of this section. The superintendent may require the submission of additional materials and information that the superintendent deems necessary to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate the competitive standard identified in Subsection D of this section. Among other materials, the superintendent may require the submission of an economist's opinion relating to the competitive impact of the acquisition in New Mexico along with an addendum addressing the economist's educational background, experience and ability to render an informed opinion.\n\n(2) A waiting period shall begin on the date that the superintendent receives a pre-acquisition notification and shall end on the thirtieth day after the date of receipt or upon the superintendent's termination of the waiting period, whichever is earlier. Prior to the end of the waiting period, the superintendent, through one request, may require the submission of additional information relevant to the proposed acquisition. A request for the submission of additional information shall trigger a new waiting period that begins on the date of receipt of the additional information and ends on the thirtieth day after that receipt or upon the superintendent's termination of the waiting period, whichever is earlier.\n\nD. The superintendent may enter an order pursuant to Subsection E of this section if there is substantial evidence that the acquisition may substantially lessen competition in a line of insurance in New Mexico or that the acquisition would tend to create a monopoly or if the insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with Subsection C of this section.\n\n(1) In determining whether a proposed acquisition would violate the competitive standard identified in this subsection, the superintendent shall consider that:\n\n(a) an acquisition identified in Subsection B of this section that involves two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of a violation of the competitive standard: 1) if the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:\n\n1% or more; or\n\n2) if the market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:\n\n1% or more;\n\n(b) for the purposes of Subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, a highly concentrated market is one in which the share of the four largest insurers is seventy-five percent or more of the market; the insurer with the largest share of the market shall be deemed to be Insurer A; a percentage not shown in a table is interpolated in proportion to the percentages shown; and if more than two insurers are involved in the acquisition, exceeding the total of the two columns in the table is prima facie evidence of a violation of the competitive standard of this subsection;\n\n(c) there is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate market share of a grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the two largest to the eight largest, has increased by seven or more percent of the market over a period of time extending from any base year five to ten years prior to the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition. An acquisition or a merger identified in Subsection B of this section that involves two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of a violation of the competitive standard of this subsection if: 1) there is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market; 2) an involved insurer is in a grouping of large insurers showing the requisite increase in the market share; and 3) another involved insurer's market is two percent or more;\n\n(d) for the purposes of this subsection: 1) \"insurer\" includes a company and a group of companies under common management, ownership or control; 2) \"market\" means the relevant product and geographical markets. In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the superintendent shall give due consideration to, among other things, existing definitions or guidelines promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners and information submitted by the parties to the acquisition. In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, such line being that used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in New Mexico, and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be New Mexico; and 3) the superintendent bears the burden of showing prima facie evidence of a violation of the competitive standard; and\n\n(e) an acquisition that is not prima facie evidence of a violation of the competitive standard pursuant to Subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph may establish the requisite anti-competitive effect based on other substantial evidence. Using other substantial evidence, a party may establish the absence of the requisite anti-competitive effect for an acquisition that violates the competitive standard pursuant to Subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Paragraph (2) of this subsection. In making a determination pursuant to this subparagraph, the superintendent shall consider relevant factors, including: 1) market shares; 2) volatility of the ranking of market leaders; 3) the number of competitors; 4) concentration; 5) the trend of concentration in the industry; and 6) the ease of entry and exit into the market.\n\n(2) An order shall not be entered pursuant to Subsection E of this section if:\n\n(a) the acquisition would yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource utilization that cannot be feasibly achieved in another way and the benefit to the public that would arise from those economies would exceed the benefits to the public that would arise from not lessening competition; or\n\n(b) the acquisition would substantially increase the availability of insurance and the benefits to the public of the increase would exceed the benefits to the public that would arise from not lessening competition.\n\nE. If an acquisition violates the standards of this section, the superintendent may enter an order requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in New Mexico with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation or an order denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do business in New Mexico. The superintendent shall only enter an order if notice of a hearing was issued before the end of the waiting period, but not less than fifteen days prior to the hearing, and the hearing has concluded. The superintendent shall not enter an order more than sixty days after the insurer filed with the superintendent pre-acquisition notification. A written decision by the superintendent that sets forth findings of fact and conclusions of law shall accompany an order. An order is void if the acquisition is not consummated. After notice and a hearing, the superintendent may fine a person that violates a valid cease-and-desist order no more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per day of the violation or suspend or revoke the person's license, or both. The superintendent may fine an insurer or other person that fails to make a filing required by this section and fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with a filing requirement no more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).\n\nF. Subsections B and C of Section 59A-37-25 NMSA 1978 and Subsection A of Section 59A-37-27 NMSA 1978 do not apply to an acquisition identified in Subsection B of this section.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 59A-37-29, enacted by Laws 2014, ch. 59, § 43.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2014, ch. 59, § 55 made Laws 2014, ch. 59, § 43 effective July 1, 2014.\n\nSeverability.— Laws 2014, ch. 59, § 54 provided that if any part or application of the provisions of Laws 2014, ch. 59 is held invalid, the remainder or its application to other situations or persons shall not be affected.",

Nothing in this section precludes a domestic insurer from participating in a common management function, a cooperative or the joint use of personnel if that participation meets the standards of Subsection A of Section 59A-37-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nC.
