Each group or blanket health insurance policy, health care plan and certificate of health insurance delivered or issued for delivery in this state that provides a prescription drug benefit for which any step therapy protocols are required shall establish clinical review criteria for those step therapy protocols.

An insurer may use its existing medical exceptions process in accordance with the provisions of Subsections D through I of this section to satisfy this requirement. The process shall be made easily accessible for insureds and practitioners on the insurer's publicly accessible website.\n\nD. An insurer shall expeditiously grant an exception to the health insurance policy's, health care plan's or certificate of insurance's step therapy protocol, based on medical necessity and a clinically valid explanation from the patient's prescribing practitioner as to why a drug on the health insurance policy's, health care plan's or certificate of insurance's formulary that is therapeutically equivalent to the prescribed drug should not be substituted for the prescribed drug, if:\n\n(1) the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request is contraindicated or will likely cause an adverse reaction by or physical or mental harm to the patient;\n\n(2) the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request is expected to be ineffective based on the known clinical characteristics of the patient and the known characteristics of the prescription drug regimen;\n\n(3) while under the insured's current health insurance policy, health care plan or certificate of insurance, or under the insured's previous health coverage, the insured has tried the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class or with the same mechanism of action as the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request and that prescription drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness, diminished effect or an adverse event; or\n\n(4) the prescription drug required pursuant to the step therapy protocol is not in the best interest of the patient, based on clinical appropriateness, because the patient's use of the prescription drug is expected to:\n\n(a) cause a significant barrier to the patient's adherence to or compliance with the patient's plan of care;\n\n(b) worsen a comorbid condition of the patient; or\n\n(c) decrease the patient's ability to achieve or maintain reasonable functional ability in performing daily activities.\n\nE. Upon the granting of an exception to a health insurance policy's, health care plan's or certificate of insurance's step therapy protocol, an insurer shall authorize coverage for the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request.\n\nF. An insurer shall respond with its decision on an insured's exception request within seventy-two hours of receipt. In cases where exigent circumstances exist, an insurer shall respond within twenty-four hours of receipt of the exception request. In the event the insurer does not respond to an exception request within the time frames required pursuant to this subsection, the exception request shall be granted.\n\nG.

The provisions of this section shall not be construed to prevent:\n\n(1) a health insurance policy, health care plan or certificate of insurance from requiring a patient to try a generic equivalent of a prescription drug before providing coverage for the equivalent brand-name prescription drug; or\n\n(2) a practitioner from prescribing a prescription drug that the practitioner has determined to be medically necessary.\n\nJ.

      "text": "A. A group health plan that is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed in this state that covers essential health benefits or covers prosthetic and custom orthotic devices shall consider these benefits habilitative or rehabilitative benefits for purposes of state or federal requirements on essential health benefits coverage.\n\nB. When performing a utilization review for a request for coverage of prosthetic or orthotic benefits, an insurer shall apply the most recent version of evidence-based treatment and fit criteria as recognized by relevant clinical specialists or their organizations. Such standards may be named by the superintendent in rule.\n\nC. An insurer shall render utilization review determinations in a nondiscriminatory manner and shall not deny coverage for habilitative or rehabilitative benefits, including prosthetics or orthotics, solely based on an insured's actual or perceived disability.\n\nD. An insurer shall not deny a prosthetic or orthotic benefit for an individual with limb loss or absence that would otherwise be covered for a non-disabled person seeking medical or surgical intervention to restore or maintain the ability to perform the same physical activity.\n\nE. A health benefits plan that is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed in this state that offers coverage for prosthetics and custom orthotic devices shall include language describing an insured's rights pursuant to Subsections C and D of this section in its evidence of coverage and any benefit denial letters.\n\nF. Prosthetic and custom orthotic device coverage shall not be subject to separate financial requirements that are applicable only with respect to that coverage. A group health plan may impose cost sharing on prosthetic or custom orthotic devices; provided that any cost-sharing requirements shall not be more restrictive than the cost-sharing requirements applicable to the plan's coverage for inpatient physician and surgical services.\n\nG. A group health plan that provides coverage for prosthetic or orthotic services shall ensure access to medically necessary clinical care and to prosthetic and custom orthotic devices and technology from not less than two distinct prosthetic and custom orthotic providers in the managed care plan's provider network located in the state. In the event that medically necessary covered orthotics and prosthetics are not available from an in-network provider, the insurer shall provide processes to refer a member to an out-of-network provider and shall fully reimburse the out-of-network provider at a mutually agreed upon rate less member cost sharing determined on an in-network basis.\n\nH. If coverage for prosthetic or custom orthotic devices is provided, payment shall be made for the replacement of a prosthetic or custom orthotic device or for the replacement of any part of such devices, without regard to continuous use or useful lifetime restrictions, if an ordering health care provider determines that the provision of a replacement device, or a replacement part of such a device, is necessary because of any of the following:\n\n(1) a change in the physiological condition of the patient;\n\n(2) an irreparable change in the condition of the device or in a part of the device; or\n\n(3) the condition of the device, or the part of the device, requires repairs and the cost of such repairs would be more than sixty percent of the cost of a replacement device or of the part being replaced.\n\nI. Confirmation from a prescribing health care provider may be required if the prosthetic or custom orthotic device or part being replaced is less than three years old.\n\nJ. The provisions of this section do not apply to excepted benefits plans subject to the Short-Term Health Plan and Excepted Benefit Act [Chapter 59A, Article 23G NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:Laws 2023, ch. 196, § 4.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2023, ch. 196, § 7 made Laws 2023, ch. 196, § 4 effective January 1, 2024.",
