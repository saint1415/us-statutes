      "text": "\"Insurance\" is a contract whereby one undertakes to pay or indemnify another as to loss from certain specified contingencies or perils, or to pay or grant a specified amount or determinable benefit in connection with ascertainable risk contingencies, or to act as surety.\n\nHistory:Laws 1984, ch. 127, § 5.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The annotations appearing below were abstracted from attorney general opinions decided under former 59-1-1 NMSA 1978 which defined \"insurance\" as \"any form of insurance, bond or indemnity contract, the issuance of which is legal in the state of New Mexico.\"\n\nContract to defend and indemnify was an insurance contract.— Where defendant's insured sued defendant and plaintiff; defendant agreed to defend and indemnify plaintiff without any further elaboration or condition, the principal object and purpose of the agreement was the defense and indemnification of plaintiff and the agreement was an insurance contract.Guest v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2010-NMSC-047, 149 N.M. 74, 244 P.3d 342,aff'g in part, rev'g in part2009-NMCA-037, 145 N.M. 797, 205 P.3d 844.\n\nIndemnification contract.— Where an insured sued the insured's insurer and the insurer's attorney for claims that arose out of the handling of the insured's uninsured motorist claim and the insurer agreed to defend and indemnity the attorney in the insured's suit, the contract was not a contract of insurance, because the contract to defend and indemnify the attorney shifted the risk of litigation to the insurer and did not involve distribution, or sharing, of the risk among others.Guest v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2009-NMCA-037, 145 N.M. 797, 205 P.3d 844,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2010-NMSC-047, 149 N.M. 74, 244 P.3d 342.\n\nTerm \"insurance\" not restrictive.— Definition of \"insurance\" appears to express an intent that the term not be restrictive. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-82; 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-20.\n\nTest for insurance.— Test as to whether certain business constitutes insurance is whether the certificate of membership or other contract issued constitutes a contract of insurance or indemnity. 1933 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 33-569.\n\nContract of insurance must be for security against riskof loss, which risk, originally resting with the insured, be shifted and assumed by the insurer, and the risk must be covered by a general fund consisting of deposits made by persons having similar contractual arrangements with the insurer. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-82.\n\nIndemnification required for insurance.— If a contract is for services and not indemnification, then it is not an insurance transaction. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-82.\n\nThird-party indemnification.— Indemnification under an insurance contract does not necessarily have to be made directly to the insured. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-82.\n\nService contracts constitute a form of insurance.1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-20.\n\nVariable annuities not insurance.— Variable annuities are subject to regulation by the commissioner of securities rather than by the superintendent of insurance, inasmuch as they are not \"insurance\" within the meaning of this section, but rather are \"securities\". 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-137.\n\nPrepaid medical fees.— Agreement between individual and physician for personal services in return for certain monthly payments involved prepayment of medical fees and not insurance. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-29.\n\nFurnishing of ambulance service not insurance.— Furnishing of ambulance service by association which sells memberships to the public entitling members to free ambulance service from any contract operator in event of sickness or injury does not amount to the doing of an insurance business, as it does not assume as its primary purpose a risk, hazard or peril but merely constitutes a contract to furnish services. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-58.\n\nSetting up of contract to indemnify the public for loss suffered by reason of necessity to utilize ambulance services was insurance. 1954 Op. Atty's Gen. No. 54-5990.\n\nWhere a person operating an ambulance proposes to offer ambulance service to the general public pursuant to an agreement which in substance recites that in consideration of $15.00 the ambulance service will be provided to and from a named hospital within a 25 mile radius for a period of one year to the subscribers of such agreement, such an arrangement is not insurance so as to be amenable to regulation under the insurance laws of New Mexico. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-30.\n\nAutomobile club services as insurance.— Various services furnished members by an automobile club, including furnishing of bond, attorney fees for defense or collection of damages, reward for return of stolen vehicle, protection against lost credit cards, emergency road service and reimbursement for expenses due to automobile disability, constituted practice of insurance. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-82.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Nonprofit Health Care Corporations Are Not Insurance Providers,\" see 10 N.M.L. Rev. 481 (1980).\n\nAm.

      "text": "A. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"charitable gift annuity\" means a transfer of cash or other property by a donor to a charitable organization in return for an annuity payable over one or two lives, under which the actuarial value of the annuity is less than the value of the cash or other property transferred and the difference in value constitutes a charitable deduction for federal tax purposes;\n\n(2) \"charitable organization\" means an entity described in:\n\n(a) Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or\n\n(b) Section 170(c) of that act; and\n\n(3) \"qualified charitable gift annuity means a charitable gift annuity described in Section 501(m)(5) and Section 514(c)(5) of that act that is issued by a charitable organization that on the date of the annuity agreement:\n\n(a) has either an unrestricted fund balance consisting of assets in excess of liabilities of not less than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) or unencumbered assets in its gift annuity fund of not less than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000); and\n\n(b) has been in continuous operation for at least three years or is a successor or affiliate of a charitable organization that has been in continuous operation for at least three years.\n\nB. The issuance of a qualified charitable gift annuity does not constitute engaging in the business of insurance in this state.\n\nC. A charitable gift annuity issued prior to July 1, 1999 is a qualified charitable gift annuity for purposes of this section, and the issuance of that charitable gift annuity does not constitute engaging in the business of insurance in this state.\n\nD. When entering into an agreement for a qualified charitable gift annuity, the charitable organization shall disclose to the donor in writing in the annuity agreement that a qualified charitable gift annuity is not insurance under the laws of this state and is not subject to regulation by the insurance division or protected by a guaranty association affiliated with the division. The disclosure shall be in a separate paragraph in a print size no smaller than that employed generally in the annuity agreement.\n\nE. A charitable organization that issues qualified charitable gift annuities shall notify the insurance division in writing by the later of October 1, 1999 or the date on which it enters into the organization's first qualified charitable gift annuity agreement. The notice shall:\n\n(1) be signed by an officer or director of the charitable organization;\n\n(2) identify the charitable organization; and\n\n(3) certify that the organization is a charitable organization and the annuities issued by the organization are qualified charitable gift annuities. The charitable organization shall not be required to provide additional information to the division except as provided in Subsection F of this section.\n\nF. The failure of a charitable organization to comply with the notice requirements provided in Subsections D and E of this section does not prevent a charitable gift annuity that otherwise meets the requirements of this section from constituting a qualified charitable gift annuity; provided, however, that the superintendent may enforce performance of those requirements by sending a letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, demanding that the charitable organization comply with the notice requirements provided in Subsections D and E of this section.\n\nG. The issuance of a qualified charitable gift annuity does not constitute a violation of the Unfair Practices Act [Chapter 57, Article 12 NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:Laws 1999, ch. 34, § 1.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 1999, ch. 34, § 2 makes the act effective on July 1, 1999.\n\nCross references.— For Sections 170(c), 501(c) and (m), and 514(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,see26 U.S.C. §§ 170(c), 501(c) and (m), and 514(c), respectively.",
