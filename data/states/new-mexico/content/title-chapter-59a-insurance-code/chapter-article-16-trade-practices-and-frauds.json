Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 170 F.3d 985 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\nDisclosures related to modal premium charges.— Under both the Unfair Practices Act and the Unfair Insurance Practices Act, an insurer may have a duty to disclose information about \"finance charges\" and \"APR\" rates when insureds pay modal premium charges, depending on the materiality of the facts.Azar v.

As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"contract\" means an annuity contract but excludes annuity contracts used to fund employment-based retirement plans or programs in which the insurer is not committed by the terms of the annuity contract to pay a death benefit to the beneficiaries of specific plan participants;\n\n(2) \"death master file\" means the federal social security administration's death master file or another database or service for determining that a person has died and that is at least as comprehensive as the federal social security administration's death master file;\n\n(3) \"match\" means a search of a death master file that results in a match of the social security number or the name and date of birth of an insured, annuity owner or retained asset account holder; and\n\n(4) \"policy\" means a policy or certificate of life insurance that provides a death benefit, but excludes policies or certificates of credit life or accidental death insurance, policies or certificates of life insurance used to fund a preneed funeral contract or funeral prearrangement and policies or certificates of life insurance that provide a death benefit pursuant to an employee benefit plan that are:\n\n(a) subject to the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; or\n\n(b) under a federal employee benefit program.\n\nB. At least twice a year, an insurer shall crosscheck its insureds' in-force life insurance policies and retained-asset accounts against a death master file to identify potential matches. For each potential match, within ninety days, the insurer shall:\n\n(1) make and document a good faith effort to confirm the death of the insured or retained-asset account holder by using other available records and information;\n\n(2) determine whether the applicable policy or contract provides for the payment of a death benefit.

An insurer or its service provider shall not charge an insured, an account holder or a beneficiary for a search or confirmation conducted pursuant to this subsection.\n\nD. The benefits from a life insurance policy or a retained asset account, plus any applicable accrued interest, shall be payable pursuant to the terms of the contract or, if applicable, in accordance with probate law. If the proper recipients of a life insurance policy or a retained asset account cannot be found, the benefits shall escheat to New Mexico as unclaimed property pursuant to the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) [Chapter 7, Article 8A NMSA 1978]. Upon the expiration of the statutory time period for escheat, an insurer shall notify the taxation and revenue department that a life insurance policy beneficiary or retained asset account holder has not submitted a claim with the insurer and the insurer has complied with the provisions of Subsection B of this section and has been unable to contact the retained asset account holder, beneficiary or beneficiaries. Upon notifying the taxation and revenue department, the insurer shall submit the unclaimed life insurance benefits or unclaimed retained asset accounts, plus any applicable accrued interest, to the taxation and revenue department pursuant to the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995).\n\nE. To assist the superintendent in identifying lost policies, by July 1, 2016, an insurer that has never conducted a crosscheck of its insureds' policies and contracts issued prior to July 1, 2013 against a death master file for the purpose of identifying deceased insureds shall provide to the superintendent a list of all policies and contracts in force and issued in New Mexico.\n\nF. For an insurer that has never conducted a crosscheck of its insureds' policies and contracts against a death master file for the purpose of identifying deceased insureds, the provisions of this section shall apply only to policies and contracts issued and delivered in New Mexico on or after July 1, 2013.\n\nHistory:Laws 2013, ch. 100, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,see26 U.S.C. § 410 et seq.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2013, ch. 100, § 3 made Laws 2013, ch. 100, § 1 effective July 1, 2013.",

No person engaged in the business of selling real or personal property or financing purchase or lending money on security of real or personal property shall share information received in connection with an application for credit in the purchase or for the loan with any parent corporation, subsidiary or affiliate of the person or with an insurer, for the purpose of soliciting insurance, unless the person has written authorization to release the information executed by the purchaser or borrower subsequent to extension of credit or making of the loan.\n\nI.

Because the duty of disclosure owed to class-two insureds is triggered only when the insurer receives actual knowledge of the identity of a class-two insured with an allegedly compensable claim, the duty of disclosure does not require the insurer to seek out the identity of class-two insureds.Salas v.

Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co., 2009-NMSC-005, 145 N.M. 542, 202 P.3d 801, modifying 2007-NMCA161, 143 N.M. 113, 173 P.3d 35.\n\nDuty to defend.— Actual notice of a claim against its insured from any source that is sufficient to permit the insurer to locate and defend its insured is sufficient to trigger the duty to defend unless the insured affirmatively declines a defense.Garcia v. Underwriters at Lloyd's, 2008-NMSC-018, 143 N.M. 732, 182 P.3d 113.\n\nDuty to defend triggered.— In New Mexico, an insurer's duty to defend is triggered when it has received actual notice of a claim against the insured, unless the insured affirmatively declines a defense. The duty to defend arises and is determined from the allegations on the face of the complaint or from the known but unpleaded factual basis of the claim that brings it arguably within the scope of coverage.Pulte Homes of N.M., Inc. v. Indiana Lumbermens Ins. Co., 2016-NMCA-028.\n\nIn a construction defects case, where plaintiff contractor tendered two demands for a defense to the insurance company that had issued a commercial general liability policy to subcontractor, naming contractor as an additional insured, and where the liability policy excluded from coverage property damage to subcontractor's own work (\"your work\" exclusion), the \"your work\" exclusion precluded coverage with regard to the first defense tender to insurer, because the only property damage alleged was to subcontractor's work itself, the windows and the sliding glass door, and not to other property. The second defense tender, however, alleged that subcontractor's defective installation of windows and sliding glass doors caused damage to some of the homeowners' other property, namely the stucco around the windows and doors. The facts presented with regard to the first defense tender did not trigger insurer's duty to defend because the \"your work\" exclusion precluded coverage under those facts. The facts presented in contractor's second defense tender to insurer triggered the insurer's duty to defend because the \"your work\" exclusion did not preclude coverage.Pulte Homes of N.M., Inc. v. Indiana Lumbermens Ins. Co., 2016-NMCA-028.\n\nAn insured's failure to give notice as required by the insurance contract is not an available defense to a claim that the insurer breached the duty to defend.— As a policy matter, New Mexico law prioritizes the duty to defend over potential contract defenses, like the failure to give notice. The policy of encouraging insurers to perform their contractual obligations outweighs any requirement that allows insurers to default on their obligation to defend simply because the insured did not formally ask the insurer to do what the insurance contract already requires.D.R. Horton, Inc. v. Trinity Universal Ins. Co., 2024-NMCA-054, cert. denied.\n\nWhere appellants alleged that defendant insurance company had a duty to defend a series of claims relating to construction defects, and where the district court, although finding that disputed facts exist about defendant's breach of the duty to defend, concluded that defendant suffered substantial prejudice from appellants' multi-year delay in providing notice of the claims to defendant and granted summary judgment in defendant's favor, the district court erred in granting summary judgment, because the determination that disputed facts exist about defendant's breach of the duty to defend precluded summary judgment and New Mexico law requires that the duty to defend question be resolved before contract defenses, such as compliance with contractual notice requirements, can be applied.D.R. Horton, Inc. v. Trinity Universal Ins. Co., 2024-NMCA-054, cert. denied.\n\nInsurer's unilateral refusal to defend constituted a breach of that duty.— Where plaintiff, the tenant of a rental dwelling, was sued by a public utility employee when the employee was injured by plaintiff's dog, and where defendant insurance company refused to tender a defense for plaintiff because plaintiff was not the named insured and did not qualify as an insured by definition under the rental dwelling policy, and where plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that defendant breached its duty to defend plaintiff in the primary action, the district court erred in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment, because defendant did not seek a judicial ruling relieving itself of its duty to defend, the insurer bears the burden of proving as a matter of law that all claims arose out of an uncovered act and thus had a duty to defend until it met that burden, and where there is a legitimate question regarding whether the claim is covered, an insurer who refused to defend has breached its duty.Dove v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 2017-NMCA-051, cert. denied.\n\nThis section was patternedafter the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Model Act.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69.\n\nPrivate right of action is recognized against insurerswho engage in unfair claim practices under the Insurance Code.Southern Farm Bureau Cas. Co. v. Hiner, 2005-NMCA-104, 138 N.M. 154, 117 P.3d 960, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-008, 138 N.M. 328, 119 P.3d 1265.\n\nSummary judgment for insurer appropriate where policy exclusion was enforceable.— Where plaintiff, a construction business that conducts, among other things, roof repair, including \"torch-down\" roofing, a technique which uses a flaming torch to heat and seal tar paper onto a roof, purchased a general commercial liability insurance policy through an insurance broker, who was authorized to sell insurance products supplied by defendant, an insurance company, and where defendant transmitted to the broker a copy of the insurance policy, which specifically precluded coverage for damages caused by torch-down roofing, and where plaintiff, unaware of the exclusion, submitted a claim for coverage after a fire occurred at a home while plaintiff was performing torch-down roofing, and where defendant denied plaintiff's insurance claim relying on the torch-down roofing exclusion, the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment, because the documents defendant provided to plaintiff notified plaintiff that there were limits and restrictions to the coverage that were fully explained within the complete policy, and therefore defendant provided plaintiff with reasonable notice of the contents of its policy. Plaintiff had notice of the torch-down roofing exclusion as a matter of law and defendant may rely on the exclusion to deny plaintiff's claim.OR&L Const. v. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co., 2022-NMCA-035.\n\nConsent-to-settle provisions may be waived.— When an insurer has received notice of a proposed settlement between its insured and a third-party tortfeasor, but fails to notify its insured of the insurer's decision to either grant or withhold consent to settle within a reasonable amount of time, the insurer may waive the consent requirement and may not rely on the consent-to-settle provision as a basis to deny coverage.Thayer v. State Farm, 2023-NMCA-090.\n\nSummary judgment for insurer was not appropriate where there was a question of fact as to whether plaintiff breached the consent-to-settle provision.— Where plaintiff filed a complaint for breach of contract and bad faith after State Farm denied his claim for underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits, and where State Farm moved for summary judgment, arguing that it was not liable for UIM benefits because plaintiff had breached a contract provision requiring him to obtain State Farm's written consent before settling with the tortfeasor, and where plaintiff acknowledged that he had settled without State Farm's permission, but asserted he had notified State Farm of the offer and waited more than a year before ultimately accepting the settlement, the district court erred in granting State Farm's motion for summary judgment, because plaintiff fully complied with his initial obligations under the policy's consent-to-settle provision by providing notice to his insurer of the proposed settlement and requesting the insurer's permission to accept the settlement, and plaintiff presented evidence that could allow a jury to infer that State Farm had a reasonable opportunity to respond to plaintiff's request for consent to settle but failed to do so, and thereby waived its right to rely on the consent-to-settle provision. Thus, there are genuine issues of fact as to whether plaintiff breached the consent-to-settle provision as a result of his settlement with the tortfeasor.Thayer v. State Farm, 2023-NMCA-090.\n\nReasonable expectations doctrine.— The reasonable expectations doctrine may be invoked when the language of an insurance policy or representations of an insurance company lead the insured to reasonably expect coverage, the language of the policy is ambiguous, or when the dynamics of the insurance transaction make way for its application.OR&L Const. v. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co., 2022-NMCA-035.\n\nReasonable expectations doctrine is a judicial doctrine applied by the courts when interpreting an insurance policy.— Where plaintiff, a construction business that conducts, among other things, roof repair, including \"torch-down\" roofing, a technique which uses a flaming torch to heat and seal tar paper onto a roof, purchased a general commercial liability insurance policy through an insurance broker, who was authorized to sell insurance products supplied by defendant, an insurance company, and where defendant transmitted to the broker a copy of the insurance policy, which specifically precluded coverage for damages caused by torch-down roofing, and where plaintiff, unaware of the exclusion, submitted a claim for coverage after a fire occurred at a home while plaintiff was performing torch-down roofing, and where defendant denied plaintiff's insurance claim relying on the torch-down roofing exclusion, and where plaintiff argued that defendant failed to consider plaintiff's reasonable expectation of coverage, the district court did not err in dismissing plaintiff's claim regarding the reasonable expectations doctrine, because the reasonable expectations doctrine is a judicial doctrine applied by the courts when interpreting an insurance policy, it is not a doctrine applicable to insurers themselves, nor does it govern what insurers must cover in an insurance policy. Insurers are not obligated to consider an insured's reasonable expectations of coverage.OR&L Const. v. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co., 2022-NMCA-035.\n\nInsurer did not violate its duty to investigate.— Where plaintiff, a construction business that conducts, among other things, roof repair, including \"torch-down\" roofing, a technique which uses a flaming torch to heat and seal tar paper onto a roof, purchased a general commercial liability insurance policy through an insurance broker, who was authorized to sell insurance products supplied by defendant, an insurance company, and where defendant transmitted to the broker a copy of the insurance policy, which specifically precluded coverage for damages caused by torch-down roofing, and where plaintiff, unaware of the exclusion, submitted a claim for coverage after a fire occurred at a home while plaintiff was performing torch-down roofing, and where defendant denied plaintiff's insurance claim relying on the torch-down roofing exclusion, and where plaintiff argued that defendant violated its duty to investigate or otherwise sought to prevent the policy's performance or withhold its benefits, the district court did not err in dismissing defendant's claim where the evidence showed that defendant inquired as to the cause of the fire, informed plaintiff that its policy did not cover torch-down roofing, and confirmed that the policy exclusion still precluded coverage after plaintiff expressed that it was unaware of the exclusion. Once defendant performed its investigation and determined that plaintiff lacked coverage for the fire, there was no performance due under the contract.OR&L Const. v. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co., 2022-NMCA-035.\n\nInsurer did not violate its duty to attempt to resolve insured's claim in good faith.— Where plaintiff, a construction business that conducts, among other things, roof repair, including \"torch-down\" roofing, a technique which uses a flaming torch to heat and seal tar paper onto a roof, purchased a general commercial liability insurance policy through an insurance broker, who was authorized to sell insurance products supplied by defendant, an insurance company, and where defendant transmitted to the broker a copy of the insurance policy, which specifically precluded coverage for damages caused by torch-down roofing, and where plaintiff, unaware of the exclusion, submitted a claim for coverage after a fire occurred at a home while plaintiff was performing torch-down roofing, and where defendant denied plaintiff's insurance claim relying on the torch-down roofing exclusion, and where plaintiff argued that defendant did not attempt to resolve plaintiff's claim in good faith, the district court did not err in denying plaintiff's claim, because plaintiff failed to establish coverage for claims regarding torch-down roofing, and an insured cannot raise a claim of bad faith based on an insurer's failure to pay a covered claim unless the insured can establish that coverage existed.OR&L Const. v. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co., 2022-NMCA-035.\n\nApplication to adjusters.— Pursuant to 59A-16-1 NMSA 1978, this section applies to adjusters as well as insurers.Dellaria & Carnes v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 2004-NMCA-132, 136 N.M. 552, 102 P.3d 111.\n\nStatutory duty under Subsection Eof this section, to attempt reasonable settlement efforts of an \"insured's claims\", includes, in the context of automobile liability insurance, attempting in good faith to settle the claim of a third party.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69.\n\nSubstantial prejudice required.— An insurer must demonstrate substantial prejudice as a result of a material beach of the insurance policy by the insured before it will be relieved of its obligations under a policy.Foundation Reserve Ins. Co. v. Esquibel, 1980-NMSC-019, 94 N.M. 132, 607 P.2d 1150.\n\nAn insurance company must demonstrate substantial prejudice from the breach of a consent-to-settle provision before it can be relieved from paying uninsured motorist benefits.State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Fennema, 2005-NMSC-010, 137 N.M. 275, 110 P.3d 491.\n\nAlthough the insurer shall have the ultimate burden of persuasion to demonstrate substantial prejudice, a presumption of substantial prejudice arises from proof that an insured has breached a consent-to-settle provision.State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Fennema, 2005-NMSC-010, 137 N.M. 275, 110 P.3d 491.\n\nComplaint stated claim.— Where under the facts alleged in the complaint, plaintiffs may be able to show that company hired by insurance company to settle claims offered lower than fair settlements with such frequency as to \"indicate a general business practice\", they have stated a claim.Dellaria & Carnes v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 2004-NMCA-132, 136 N.M. 552, 102 P.3d 111.\n\nFailure to state claim.— Insured's allegation generally that the insurer's conduct violated \"one or more of the provisions of [this section]\" failed to state claim for relief because the insured did not specify which of the fifteen provisions of the section he felt the insurer violated, and it could not be perceived which subsection could have been violated under the facts alleged.Yumukoglu v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co., 131 F. Supp. 2d 1215 (D.N.M. 2001).\n\nSufficient evidence of bad faith.— Where the injured spouse was severely injured when the driving spouse attempted to pass on a blind curve and collided head-on with another vehicle; the driving spouse's insurer knew within four days after the accident that the injured spouse's claim would exceed the $100,000 policy limits of the driving spouse's liability insurance policy and that the driving spouse was solely at fault for the accident; the insurer applied a policy provision that the insurer knew to be invalid to reduce the amount it would pay for family members; the insurer paid the policy limit for medical expenses and refused to pay the remainder of the injured spouse's medical expenses; the insurer made no attempt to settle the matter; on September 22, 2003, the injured spouse demanded payment of the full value of the policy; the insurer ignored the offer and allowed it to expire; the insurer had the information it needed to settle by August 10, 2003; from September 24, 2003 until October 22, 2003, the insurer asked the injured spouse for more information and medical authorization releases even though the information was readily available without medical authorization releases; on October 22, 2003, the insurer sent a letter to the injured spouse claiming that the injured spouse and the insurer had agreed to settle for an amount less than the injured spouse's medical bills; the injured spouse did not accept the offer; the injured spouse was awarded personal injury damages of $2.8 million dollars against the driving spouse; and in 2005, with the goal of thwarting the injured spouse's bad faith claim against the insurer, the insurer sued the driving spouse in federal court in Texas to establish that the driving spouse was liable for the excess judgment in the personal injury action, the evidence was sufficient to support the district court's finding that the insurer acted in bad faith,Dydek v. Dydek, 2012-NMCA-088, 288 P.3d 872.\n\nApplicability of Subsection C.— The word \"claims\" in Subsection C means first-party claims, not demands for defense against third-party claims.Valley Improvement Ass'n v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Corp., 129 F.3d 1108 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\nInsurer's duty to investigate demands by insured to provide defense.— An insurance company is required to conduct a reasonable investigation into the facts and circumstances underlying the complaint against its insured in order to determine whether it has a duty to defend. Reasonableness is determined in light of the information provided by the insured and the circumstances surrounding the claim.G & G Servs., Inc. v. Agora Syndicate, Inc., 2000-NMCA-003, 128 N.M. 434, 993 P.2d 751, cert. quashed, 129 N.M. 520, 10 P.3d 843.\n\nDuty to fairly investigate and evaluate claims.— Where a police officer saw two vehicles heading toward the officer; the vehicle driven by the insured collided with the officer's vehicle; the officer charged the insured with drag racing and reckless driving; the insured's insurer received a statement from the insured denying that the insured had engaged in racing and a statement from the officer that the insured had initially denied racing, then later admitted it; because the insured's insurance policy excluded coverage for accidents resulting from racing, the insurer denied the insured's claim; several months after the accident, the racing charge against the insured was dismissed; the insurer continued to deny coverage based on the racing exclusion and the officer's statement that the insured had admitted to racing; and the insured's expert testified that the insurer favored its own interests over the interests of the insured and paid little attention to what the insured told the insurer, failed to ask the insured if the insured was racing, failed to review the claim when the charges against the insured were dismissed and instead reaffirmed its original position, failed to demonstrate how it evaluated and decided the claim, and looked at one-sided evidence and information, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find bad faith based on the manner in which the insurer's investigation of the insured's claim was conducted.Am. Nat'l. Prop. & Cas. Co. v. Cleveland, 2013-NMCA-013, 293 P.3d 954.\n\nClear mandate of public policy sufficient to support a claim of retaliatory discharge.— A retaliatory discharge cause of action is recognized in New Mexico as a narrow exception to the general rule that employment at will can be terminated by either the employer or the employee for any reason, or for no reason at all. Under this cause of action, an employee must identify a specific expression of public policy which the discharge violated, demonstrate that he or she acted in furtherance of the clearly mandated public policy, and show that he or she was terminated as a result of those acts.Sherrill v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 2016-NMCA-056.\n\nIn a retaliatory discharge claim, where plaintiff alleged that insurance company's practices promoted premature settlements for vulnerable injured claimants, and where the district court determined that plaintiff failed to identify a clearly mandated public policy sufficient to support a claim of retaliatory discharge, summary judgment was improper because 59A-16-20 NMSA 1978 embodies a clear mandate of the public policy in favor of protecting the public from unfair and deceptive insurance claims practices, a policy whose parameters are not too vague or ambiguous to provide guidance on prohibited conduct, sufficient to support a claim of retaliatory discharge.Sherrill v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 2016-NMCA-056.\n\nRefusal to defend insured upheld.— Insurer did not violate Subsection E by refusing to defend the insured in a case charging the insured with negligent touching, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress, since the liability policy provided coverage for damages due to bodily injury or property damages caused by an \"occurrence,\" which was defined as an accident, and since the plaintiff did not allege facts even tending to show an occurrence under the policy.Sena v. Travelers Ins. Co., 801 F. Supp. 471 (D.N.M. 1992).\n\nInsurer did not have a duty to defend.— Where a third party leased property from plaintiffs to develop into a drug store that the third party intended to lease to a national drug store operator; the third party sued plaintiffs for claims based on the third party's allegation that plaintiffs used their superior bargaining power to coerce the third party to provide additional improvements and concessions not covered by the original lease agreement; plaintiffs sued defendant for failure to defend plaintiffs in the third party lawsuit pursuant to plaintiffs' liability insurance policy, which required defendant to defend plaintiffs against injury arising out of abuse of process or malicious prosecution; plaintiffs alleged, and the district court assumed, that the motivation for the third party complaint was that plaintiffs had threatened the third party with litigation in order to coerce the third party to agree to favorable business terms; and the third party's complaint did not make an express claim for malicious abuse of process, and the facts underlying the third party's complaint did not state a claim for malicious abuse of process, defendant did not have a duty to defend under the policy.Hinkle v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 2013-NMCA-084, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-007.\n\nDuty of insurer to settle with a third-party claimant.— Article 16 confers upon a victim of an automobile accident a direct right of action against the insured's automobile liability insurance company, when the liability insurer fails to make good-faith efforts, as defined by Subsection E of this section, to settle a liability claim.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69.\n\nPrivate right of action for third partieswho are victims of automobile accidents is consistent with a statutory scheme that was intended to benefit both insureds and third-party claimants.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69,aff'gHovet v. Lujan, 2003-NMCA-061, 133 N.M. 611, 66 P.3d 980.\n\nThird-party claimant may not sue both insured and insurerin the same lawsuit.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69.\n\nClaimant will not even have an action under Subsection Eof this section, unless and until there has been a judicial determination of the insured's fault and the amount of damages awarded in the underlying negligence action.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69.\n\nQui tam action by federal government.— Claims under the New Mexico Unfair Insurance Practices Act were necessarily dismissed given the fact that defendant insurance companies had no duty to defend nor indemnify plaintiff against a qui tam action brought by the federal government.New Mem'l Assocs. v. Credit Gen. Ins. Corp., 973 F. Supp. 1027 (D.N.M. 1997).\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico insurance law, 19 N.M.L.

Without amending other statutes dealing with checks, drafts or electronic transfer of funds, a resident of New Mexico is granted a cause of action for ten percent of the amount of any check, draft or electronic transfer of funds that is not paid or lawfully rejected within ten days of forwarding by a New Mexico financial institution, but in no case to be less than five hundred dollars ($500) plus costs of suit and attorney fees. The insurer shall not be required to pay such civil damages for delay if it proves that the delay in processing and payment was caused by a financial institution or postal or delivery service and the check, draft or electronic transfer of funds was paid or lawfully rejected within forty-eight hours of actual receipt of the draft, check or electronic transfer of funds by the person on whom drawn.\n\nB. Notwithstanding any provision of the Insurance Code [Chapter 59A NMSA 1978], any insurer issuing any policy, certificate or contract of insurance, surety, guaranty or indemnity of any kind or nature that fails for a period of forty-five days, after required proof of loss has been furnished, to pay to the person entitled the amount justly due shall be liable for the amount due and unpaid with interest on that amount at the rate of one and one-half times the prime lending rate for New Mexico banks during the period the claim is unpaid.

If the superintendent believes that any person engaged in any business which is subject to the superintendent's supervision under the Insurance Code, is in the conduct of such business engaging in this state in any method of competition or in any act or practice not defined in this article which is unfair or deceptive and that a proceeding by him in respect thereto would be in the public interest, the superintendent shall, after a hearing of which notice and of the charges against such person are given him, make a written report of his findings of fact relative to such charges and serve a copy thereof upon such person and any intervenor at the hearing.\n\nB. If such report charges a violation of this article and if such method of competition, act or practice has not been discontinued, the superintendent may at any time after twenty (20) days after the service of such report cause an action to be instituted in the district court of the county wherein the person resides or has his principal place of business to enjoin and restrain such person from engaging in such method, act or practice. The court shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and shall have power to make and enter appropriate orders in connection therewith and to issue such writs or orders as are ancillary to its jurisdiction or necessary in its judgment to prevent injury to the public pendente lite; but the state of New Mexico shall not be required to give security before the issuance of any such order or injunction under this section.

The court may award attorneys' fees to the prevailing party if:\n\nA. the party complaining of the violation of that article has brought an action that he knew to be groundless; or\n\nB. the party charged with the violation of that article has willfully engaged in the violation.\n\nThe relief provided in this section is in addition to remedies otherwise available against the same conduct under the common law or other statutes of this state; provided, however, that the Workers' Compensation Act [Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978] and the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law provide exclusive remedies.\n\nHistory:Laws 1984, ch. 127, § 296.1; 1990 (2nd S.S.), ch. 2, § 91.\n\nCross references.— For New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law,see52-3-1 NMSA 1978 and notes thereto.\n\nNo cause of action if insurance is nonmandatory.— A third-party claimant does not have a statutory bad faith cause of action against an excess liability insurer for failure to settle an underlying suit, pursuant to the New Mexico Insurance Code, where the excess liability insurance policy between the insurer and the insured is not mandated by New Mexico law.Jolley v. Associated Elec. & Gas Ins. Servs. Ltd., 2010-NMSC-029, 148 N.M. 436, 237 P.3d 738.\n\nWhere the decedent died as a result of an explosion and fire caused by the collision of the decedent's vehicle with an unprotected natural gas wellhead; the owner of the gas well had an excess reimbursement insurance policy; the owner rejected the decedent's estate's offer of settlement; the estate obtained a judgment against the owner for compensatory and punitive damages in an amount that substantially exceeded the amount of the estate's settlement offer; the estate sued defendant for failure to make a good faith effort to settle the estate's lawsuit; and the excess liability policy was not required by any New Mexico law, the decedent's estate did not have a bad faith cause of action against the insurer.Jolley v. Associated Elec. & Gas Ins. Servs. Ltd., 2010-NMSC-029, 148 N.M. 436, 237 P.3d 738.\n\nJudgment rule.— Damages in insurance bad faith actions are determined by the judgment rule which does not require the insured to make payment as a precondition to the insurers' liability. A bad faith insurer is liable regardless of whether its insured has paid, can pay or must pay an excess judgment.Dydek v. Dydek, 2012-NMCA-088, 288 P.3d 872.\n\nWhere the injured spouse was severely injured when the driving spouse attempted to pass on a blind curve and collided head-on with another vehicle; the injured spouse was awarded personal injury damages of $2.8 million dollars against the driving spouse; the policy limits of the driving spouse's liability insurance policy was $100,000; the driving spouse was awarded excess damages of $2.7 million dollars against the driving spouse's insurer for bad faith; and the injured spouse agreed not to enforce the personal injury judgment against the driving spouse personally, the insurer was liable for the excess judgment.Dydek v. Dydek, 2012-NMCA-088, 288 P.3d 872.\n\nThe private right of action is a statutory cause of actionand is not founded on or related to any common law liability or contractual obligation.Martinez v. Cornejo, 2009-NMCA-011, 146 N.M. 223, 208 P.3d 443, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-001, 145 N.M. 655, 203 P.3d 870.\n\nAttorney fees incurred by an employee in a mandamus actionto compel the employee's governmental employer to appoint independent defense counsel to defend the employee pursuant to the Tort Claims Act are not recoverable by the employee under the Insurance Code.Paz v. Tijerina, 2007-NMCA-109, 142 N.M. 391, 165 P.3d 1167.\n\nReservation of rights against insurer in settlement agreement.— The absence of a judicial determination of fault or liability is an absolute bar to a third party claim against an insurer and the reservation in a settlement agreement with an insured of a claim against the insured's insurer does not create any rights against the insurer.King v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2007-NMCA-044, 141 N.M. 612, 159 P.3d 261, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-004, 141 N.M. 568, 158 P.3d 458.\n\nActual notice of a claim against the insuredtriggers the duty to defend even if the insured has not given notice of the claim to the insurer.Garcia v. Underwriters at Lloyd's London, 2007-NMCA-042, 141 N.M. 421, 156 P.3d 712,aff'd, 2008-NMSC-018, 143 N.M. 732, 182 P.3d 113.\n\nAn insured's failure to give notice as required by the insurance contract is not an available defense to a claim that the insurer breached the duty to defend.— As a policy matter, New Mexico law prioritizes the duty to defend over potential contract defenses, like the failure to give notice. The policy of encouraging insurers to perform their contractual obligations outweighs any requirement that allows insurers to default on their obligation to defend simply because the insured did not formally ask the insurer to do what the insurance contract already requires.D.R. Horton, Inc. v. Trinity Universal Ins. Co., 2024-NMCA-054, cert. denied.\n\nWhere appellants alleged that defendant insurance company had a duty to defend a series of claims relating to construction defects, and where the district court, although finding that disputed facts exist about defendant's breach of the duty to defend, concluded that defendant suffered substantial prejudice from appellants' multi-year delay in providing notice of the claims to defendant and granted summary judgment in defendant's favor, the district court erred in granting summary judgment, because the determination that disputed facts exist about defendant's breach of the duty to defend precluded summary judgment and New Mexico law requires that the duty to defend question be resolved before contract defenses, such as compliance with contractual notice requirements, can be applied.D.R. Horton, Inc. v. Trinity Universal Ins. Co., 2024-NMCA-054, cert. denied.\n\nLegislature intendedto create a remedy for third-party claimants.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69.\n\nThe text of this section leaves no impression that the legislature intended to deny a remedy to third-party claimants.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69.\n\nLegislative purpose.— In creating a separate statutory action, the legislature had a remedial purpose in mind.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69.\n\nIn choosing the words \"any person\" the legislature did not mean to restrict recoverysolely to first parties, those insured under the policy.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69.\n\nPrivate right of action for third partieswho are victims of automobile accidents is consistent with a statutory scheme that was intended to benefit both insureds and third-party claimants.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69.\n\nA private right of action for third-party claimants enforces the policy of the Insurance Code, which is to promote ethical settlement practices within the insurance industry.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69.\n\nSufficient evidence to support insurer's denial of benefits in third-party claim.— Where the district court's finding that defendant's blood alcohol content was nearly double the New Mexico threshold for a presumption of intoxication was based on improperly admitted evidence, the district court's determination that defendant was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident was upheld where other properly admitted evidence showed that defendant was drinking on the evening of the accident, that emergency medical personnel smelled alcohol on defendant's person at the scene of the accident, a medical record that was properly admitted indicated that defendant had a blood alcohol level of .26, and an expert in traumatic brain injuries testified that defendant's blood alcohol level \"would be an intoxicating level.\" The evidence supported reasonable inferences that defendant was under the influence of alcohol when he left a liquor establishment on his all terrain vehicle, and that consequently defendant's driving ability was impaired, and that defendant's alcohol use was a cause of the accident.Brawley v. Board of Regents, 2016-NMCA-037, cert. denied.\n\nThird-party claimant may not sue both insured and insurerin the same lawsuit.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69.\n\nClaimant will not even have an action under 59A-16-20 ENMSA 1978, unless and until there has been a judicial determination of the insured's fault and the amount of damages awarded in the underlying negligence action.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69.\n\nExclusion of attorneys.— The private right of action under the Insurance Code is limited by statute to violations by insurance companies and their agents; attorneys are not included.Hovet v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-010, 135 N.M. 397, 89 P.3d 69.\n\nReliance on deceptive conduct.— Consistent with a national trend to interpret consumer protection statutes, like the Unfair Insurance Practices Act, such that plaintiffs need not prove reliance, and consistent with the absence of language in the act requiring reliance, a plaintiff need not allege or prove that she relied on defendant's purported deceptive conduct in order to recover under the act.Smoot v. Physicians Life Ins. Co., 2004-NMCA-027, 135 N.M. 265, 87 P.3d 545.\n\nProof of link required.— While it is true that the Unfair Insurance Practices Act requires proof of a casual link between conduct and loss, there is nothing in the language of the act requiring proof of a link between conduct and purchase or sale.Smoot v. Physicians Life Ins. Co., 2004-NMCA-027, 135 N.M. 265, 87 P.3d 545.\n\nArbitration clause barred.— Regulation mandating arbitration clause in title insurance contract is in conflict with 57-12-10 NMSA 1978 and this section; therefore, plaintiff in suit against title company may have statutory claims heard in a court of law.Lisanti v. Alamo Title Ins. of Tex., 2001-NMCA-100, 131 N.M. 334, 35 P.3d 989,aff'd, 2002-NMSC-032, 132 N.M. 750, 55 P.3d 962.\n\nBecause 59A-16-30 and 57-12-10 NMSA 1978 provide for judicial actions on claims of unfair insurance and trade practices, a regulation, NMAC 13.14.18.14, which requires mandatory arbitration in title insurance policy disputes, is unenforceable because it violates the landowner's right to a trial by jury, as guaranteed by N.M. Const. art. II, § 12, in his action against a title insurance company asserting the above-stated claims and because the rights created by the statutes prevail over the regulation.Lisanti v. Alamo Title Ins., 2002-NMSC-032, 132 N.M. 750, 55 P.3d 962, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1193, 123 S. Ct. 1288, 154 L. Ed. 2d 1027 (2003).\n\nGroundless claims.— Plaintiffs are subject to fee sanctions if they have brought suit knowing they can present no legal argument to support the claim, or knowing they cannot come forth with the appropriate factual predicate to support their theory.City of Farmington v. L.R. Foy Constr. Co., 1991-NMSC-067, 112 N.M. 404, 816 P.2d 473.\n\nThis section expresses the clear legislative intent that in order for plaintiffs to be sanctioned with attorneys' fees it must be shown they subjectively knew at the time the suit was filed that the complaint was groundless. Under the appropriate circumstances, however, the filing of an amended complaint may constitute the bringing of an action, and, if done with knowledge that its allegations provided no grounds to prevail, may subject the plaintiff to sanctions.City of Farmington v. L.R. Foy Constr. Co., 1991-NMSC-067, 112 N.M. 404, 816 P.2d 473.\n\nA claim is groundless if the allegations in the complaint, although sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, are not in good faith discoverable through litigation.City of Farmington v. L.R. Foy Constr. Co., 1991-NMSC-067, 112 N.M. 404, 816 P.2d 473.\n\nThe determination of whether a suit is groundless from the outset should not turn on a pleading that may be inartfully drafted or facts that may not have been available when the pleadings were filed so that certain allegations could not be made.City of Farmington v. L.R. Foy Constr. Co., 1991-NMSC-067, 112 N.M. 404, 816 P.2d 473.\n\nDismissal prior to a trial on the merits is not dispositive of the issue of groundlessness.City of Farmington v. L.R. Foy Constr. Co., 1991-NMSC-067, 112 N.M. 404, 816 P.2d 473.\n\nRemand for an evidentiary hearing was appropriate, where factual questions remained as to whether a city knew that its third-party suit against an insurer was groundless.City of Farmington v. L.R. Foy Constr. Co., 1991-NMSC-067, 112 N.M. 404, 816 P.2d 473.\n\nJury verdict supports award of fees.— Insured's entitlement to attorney's fees was established by the factual determinations implicit in the jury's award of punitive damages.O'Neel v. USAA Ins. Co., 2002-NMCA-028, 131 N.M. 630, 41 P.3d 356, cert. denied, 131 N.M. 737, 42 P.3d 842.\n\nAward of fees and costs.— Where plaintiff, a construction business that conducts, among other things, roof repair, including \"torch-down\" roofing, a technique which uses a flaming torch to heat and seal tar paper onto a roof, purchased a general commercial liability insurance policy through an insurance broker, who was authorized to sell insurance products supplied by defendant, an insurance company, and where defendant transmitted to the broker a copy of the insurance policy, which specifically precluded coverage for damages caused by torch-down roofing, and where plaintiff, unaware of the exclusion, submitted a claim for coverage after a fire occurred at a home while plaintiff was performing torch-down roofing, and where defendant denied plaintiff's insurance claim relying on the torch-down roofing exclusion, and where the district court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that plaintiff had reasonable notice of the torch-down roofing exclusion as a matter of law and awarded costs to defendant, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding costs and fees where it affirmatively explained, in a detailed twelve-page order, its reasons for awarding fees and costs in a manner that was not contrary to logic or reason.OR&L Const. v. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co., 2022-NMCA-035.\n\nAward of attorney fees was proper where insurance company willfully committed several violations of Article 16.— Where plaintiff was an attorney who represented Allstate insurance company in a lawsuit brought by insureds, and where plaintiff sued Allstate for failing to honor its agreement to indemnify her in the litigation, resulting in a jury award of compensatory and punitive damages based on Allstate's breach of contract, breach of its duty of good faith and fair dealing, and prima facie tort, and, where, after several appeals and appellate court decisions, Allstate argued that neither NMSA 1978, § 39-2-1 nor NMSA 1978, § 59A-16-30(B) support awarding plaintiff attorney fees and that the district court exceeded a supreme court mandate directing the district court to evaluate punitive damages based on plaintiff's reduced compensatory damages, the district court exceeded its mandate by upholding the punitive damage award which was not based on the amount of compensatory damages contemplated by the supreme court mandate, but the district court did not err in awarding plaintiff attorney fees under § 59A-16-30(B), because costs, including attorney fees, may be awarded if the district court finds a willful violation of Chapter 59A, Article 16 of the Insurance Code, and, in this case, the district court found that Allstate had willfully committed several violations of Article 16.Guest v. Allstate, 2024-NMCA-022, cert. denied.\n\nPre- and post-judgment interest on award of attorney fees.— Where plaintiff was an attorney who represented Allstate insurance company in a lawsuit brought by insureds, and where plaintiff sued Allstate for failing to honor its agreement to indemnify her in the litigation, resulting in a jury award of compensatory and punitive damages based on Allstate's breach of contract, breach of its duty of good faith and fair dealing, and prima facie tort, and where the district court awarded 6 percent prejudgment interest on plaintiff's award of her own fees compounded monthly, and post-judgment interest on the award of punitive damages that compounds annually, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest, which is permissible under NMSA 1978, § 56-8-4(B), but the district court erred in awarding compounding interest, because there is no legal basis for awarding compound interest in this case.Guest v. Allstate, 2024-NMCA-022, cert. denied.\n\nInsured's request for apportioned attorneys' fees rejected.— In an action involving a question of whether an insurer who had a subrogated interest in the insured's settlement was required to pay a proportionate share of the insured's attorney fees incurred in settling the claim, evidence supported the finding that the insurer's conduct was reasonable and did not violate this section because the issue had not been previously addressed by the courts and was open to legitimate debate.Amica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Maloney, 1995-NMSC-059, 120 N.M. 523, 903 P.2d 834.\n\nFederal diversity jurisdiction.— In unfair trade practices action, federal court did not err in assuming diversity jurisdiction based on amount in controversy of $50,000 (now $75,000), where treble damages sought were $41,028.51 and the plaintiff sought reasonable attorney's fees and costs.Miera v. Dairyland Ins. Co., 143 F.3d 1337 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico commercial law, see 16 N.M.L.
