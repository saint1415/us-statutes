If a member insurer is an impaired insurer, the association may, in its discretion, and subject to conditions imposed by the association that do not impair the contractual obligations of the impaired insurer and that are approved by the superintendent:\n\n(1) guarantee, assume, reissue or reinsure, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, reissued or reinsured, any or all of the policies or contracts of the impaired insurer; and\n\n(2) provide such money, pledges, loans, notes, guarantees or other means as are proper to effectuate Paragraph (1) of this subsection and assure payment of the contractual obligations of the impaired insurer pending action pursuant to Paragraph (1) of this subsection.\n\nB. If a member insurer is an insolvent insurer, the association shall, in its discretion, either:\n\n(1) guarantee, assume, reissue or reinsure, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, reissued or reinsured, the policies or contracts of the insolvent insurer, or assure payment of the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer, and provide money, pledges, loans, notes, guarantees or other means reasonably necessary to discharge the association's duties; or\n\n(2) provide benefits and coverages in accordance with the following provisions:\n\n(a) with respect to policies and contracts, assure payment of benefits that would have been payable under the policies or contracts of the insolvent insurer, for claims incurred: 1) with respect to group policies and contracts, not later than the earlier of the next renewal date under those policies or contracts or forty-five days, but in no event less than thirty days, from the date on which the association becomes obligated with respect to the policies and contracts; and 2) with respect to non-group policies, contracts and annuities, not later than the earlier of the next renewal date, if any, under the policies or contracts or one year, but in no event less than thirty days, from the date on which the association becomes obligated with respect to the policies or contracts;\n\n(b) make diligent efforts to provide all known insureds, enrollees or annuitants, for non-group policies and contracts, or group policy holders or contract owners with respect to group policies and contracts, thirty days' notice of the termination, pursuant to Subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, of the benefits provided;\n\n(c) with respect to non-group policies or contracts covered by the association, and with respect to an individual formerly insured, enrolled or formerly an annuitant under a group policy or contract who is not eligible for replacement group coverage, make available to each known insured, enrollee or annuitant, or owner if other than the insured, enrollee or annuitant, substitute coverage on an individual basis in accordance with the provisions of Subparagraph (d) of this paragraph if the insureds, enrollees or annuitants had a right under law or the terminated policy, contract or annuity to convert coverage to individual coverage or to continue an individual policy, contract or annuity in force until a specified age or for a specified time, during which the insurer or health maintenance organization had no right unilaterally to make changes in any provision of the policy, contract or annuity or had a right only to make changes in premium by class;\n\n(d) in providing the substitute coverage required pursuant to Subparagraph (c) of this paragraph, the association may offer either to reissue the terminated coverage or to issue an alternative policy or contract at actuarially justified rates. Alternative or reissued policies or contracts shall be offered without requiring evidence of insurability and shall not provide for a waiting period or exclusion that would not have applied under the terminated policy or contract. The association may reinsure an alternative or reissued policy or contract;\n\n(e) alternative policies or contracts adopted by the association shall be subject to the approval of the superintendent. The association may adopt alternative policies or contracts of various types for future issuance without regard to a particular impairment or insolvency. Alternative policies or contracts shall contain at least the minimum statutory provisions required in this state and provide benefits that shall not be unreasonable in relation to the premium charged. The association shall set the premium in accordance with a table of rates that it shall adopt. The premium shall reflect the amount of insurance to be provided and the age and class of risk of each insured but shall not reflect changes in the health of the insured after the original policy or contract was last underwritten. An alternative policy or contract issued by the association shall provide coverage of a type similar to that of the policy or contract issued by the impaired or insolvent insurer, as determined by the association;\n\n(f) if the association elects to reissue terminated coverage at a premium rate different from that charged under the terminated policy or contract, the premium shall be actuarially justified and set by the association in accordance with the amount of insurance provided and the age and class of risk, subject to the approval of the superintendent;\n\n(g) the association's obligations with respect to coverage under a policy or contract of the impaired or insolvent insurer or under a reissued or alternative policy or contract shall cease on the date the coverage or policy is replaced by another similar policy by the policy owner, contract owner, enrollee, the insured or the association; and\n\n(h) when proceeding under this subsection with respect to a policy or contract carrying guaranteed minimum interest rates, the association shall assure the payment or crediting of a rate of interest consistent with Paragraph (3) of Subsection E of Section 59A-42-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. Nonpayment of premiums within thirty-one days after the date required under the terms of a guaranteed, assumed, alternative or reissued policy or contract or substitute coverage shall terminate the association's obligations under the policy, contract or coverage pursuant to the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act with respect to the policy, contract or coverage, except with respect to claims incurred or net cash surrender value that may be due in accordance with the provisions of that act.\n\nD. Premiums due for coverage after entry of an order of liquidation of an insolvent insurer shall belong to and be payable at the direction of the association. If the liquidator of an insolvent insurer requests, the association shall provide a report to the liquidator regarding such premium collected by the association. The association shall be liable for unearned premiums due to policy or contract owners arising after the entry of the order.\n\nE. The protection provided by the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act shall not apply where guaranty protection is provided to residents of this state by the laws of the domiciliary state or jurisdiction of the impaired or insolvent insurer other than this state.\n\nF. In carrying out its duties pursuant to Subsection B of this section, the association may:\n\n(1) subject to approval by a court in this state, impose permanent policy or contract liens in connection with a guaranty, assumption or reinsurance agreement if the association finds that the amounts that can be assessed are less than the amounts needed to assure full and prompt performance of the association's duties, or if it finds that the economic or financial conditions as they affect member insurers are sufficiently adverse to render the imposition of such permanent policy or contract liens to be in the public interest; or\n\n(2) subject to approval by a court in this state, impose temporary moratoriums or liens on payments of cash values and policy loans, or another right to withdraw funds held in conjunction with policies or contracts, in addition to contractual provisions for deferral of cash or policy loan value. In addition, in the event of a temporary moratorium or moratorium charge imposed by the receivership court on payment of cash values or policy loans, or on another right to withdraw funds held in conjunction with policies or contracts, out of the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer, the association may defer the payment of cash values, policy loans or other rights by the association for the period of the moratorium or moratorium charge imposed by the receivership court, except for claims covered by the association to be paid in accordance with a hardship procedure established by the liquidator or rehabilitator and approved by the receivership court.\n\nG. A deposit in this state, held pursuant to law or required by the superintendent for the benefit of creditors, including policy or contract owners, not turned over to the domiciliary liquidator upon the entry of a final order of liquidation or order approving a rehabilitation plan of a member insurer domiciled in this state or in a reciprocal state, pursuant to Chapter 59A, Article 10 NMSA 1978, shall be promptly paid to the association. The association is entitled to retain a portion of an amount paid to it equal to the percentage determined by dividing the aggregate amount of policy or contract owners' claims related to that insolvency for which the association has provided statutory benefits by the aggregate amount of all policy or contract owners' claims in this state related to that insolvency and shall remit to the domiciliary receiver the amount so paid to the association less the amount retained pursuant to this subsection. An amount paid to the association and retained by it shall be treated as a distribution of estate assets pursuant to the Insurers Conservation, Rehabilitation and Liquidation Law [Chapter 59A, Article 41 NMSA 1978] or similar provision of the state of domicile of the impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\nH. If the association fails to act within a reasonable period of time with respect to an insolvent insurer, as provided in Subsection B of this section, the superintendent shall have the powers and duties of the association with respect to the insolvent insurer.\n\nI. The association may render assistance and advice to the superintendent, upon the superintendent's request, concerning rehabilitation, payment of claims, continuance of coverage or the performance of other contractual obligations of an impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\nJ. The association shall have standing to appear or intervene before a court or agency in this state with jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer concerning which the association is or may become obligated pursuant to the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act or with jurisdiction over a person or property against which the association may have rights through subrogation or otherwise. Standing shall extend to all matters germane to the powers and duties of the association, including proposals for reinsuring, reissuing, modifying or guaranteeing the policies or contracts of the impaired or insolvent insurer and the determination of the policies or contracts and contractual obligations. The association shall also have the right to appear or intervene before a court or agency in another state with jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer for which the association is or may become obligated or with jurisdiction over a person or property against whom the association may have rights through subrogation or otherwise.\n\nK. The association shall have subrogation rights under the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act as follows:\n\n(1) a person receiving benefits pursuant to the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act shall be deemed to have assigned the rights under, and any causes of action against any person for losses arising pursuant to, resulting from or otherwise relating to, the covered policy or contract to the association to the extent of the benefits received, whether the benefits are payments of or on account of contractual obligations, continuation of coverage or provision of substitute or alternative policies, contracts or coverages. The association may require an assignment to it of those rights and causes of action by an enrollee, payee, policy or contract owner, beneficiary, insured or annuitant as a condition precedent to the receipt of a right or benefit conferred upon the person;\n\n(2) the subrogation rights of the association pursuant to this subsection shall have the same priority against the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer as that possessed by the person entitled to receive benefits;\n\n(3) in addition to Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the association shall have all common law rights of subrogation and any other equitable or legal remedy that would have been available to the impaired or insolvent insurer or owner, beneficiary, enrollee or payee of a policy or contract with respect to the policy or contracts;\n\n(4) if Paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection is invalid or ineffective with respect to a person or claim for any reason, the amount payable by the association with respect to the related covered obligations shall be reduced by the amount realized by another person with respect to the person or claim that is attributable to the policies or contracts, or to the portion of the policies or contracts, covered by the association; and\n\n(5) if the association has provided benefits with respect to a covered obligation and a person recovers amounts as to which the association has rights as described in this subsection, the person shall pay to the association the portion of the recovery attributable to the policies or contracts, or to the portion of the policies or contracts, covered by the association.\n\nL. In addition to its other rights and powers, the association may:\n\n(1) enter into contracts that are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act;\n\n(2) sue or be sued, including taking legal actions necessary or proper to recover unpaid assessments pursuant to Section 59A-42-8 NMSA 1978 and to settle claims or potential claims against it;\n\n(3) borrow money to effect the purposes of the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act. Notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the association not in default shall be legal investments for domestic member insurers and may be carried as admitted assets;\n\n(4) employ or retain those persons necessary or appropriate to handle the financial transactions of the association and to perform other functions as become necessary or proper;\n\n(5) take legal action that may be necessary or appropriate to avoid or recover payment of improper claims;\n\n(6) exercise, to the extent approved by the superintendent, the powers of a domestic life insurer, health maintenance organization or health insurer, but in no case may the association issue policies or contracts other than those issued to perform its obligations pursuant to the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act;\n\n(7) organize itself as a corporation or in other legal form permitted by the laws of this state;\n\n(8) request information from a person seeking coverage from the association in order to aid the association in determining its obligations with respect to that person, and that person shall promptly comply with the request;\n\n(9) unless prohibited by law, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy or contract, file for an actuarially justified rate or premium increase for a policy or contract for which it provides coverage under the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act; and\n\n(10) take other necessary or appropriate action to discharge its duties and obligations or to exercise its powers.\n\nM.

The association may succeed to the rights and obligations of an insolvent insurer as follows:\n\n(1) at any time within one hundred eighty days of the date of the order of liquidation, the association may elect to succeed to the rights and obligations of the ceding member insurer that relate to policies, contracts or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, in each case under one or more reinsurance contracts entered into by the insolvent insurer and its reinsurers and selected by the association. The assumption shall be effective as of the date of the order of liquidation. The election shall be effected by the association or the national organization of life and health insurance guaranty associations on its behalf sending written notice, return receipt requested, to the affected reinsurers;\n\n(2) to facilitate the earliest practicable decision about whether to assume any of the contracts of reinsurance, and in order to protect the financial position of the estate, the receiver and each reinsurer of the ceding member insurer shall make available, upon request, to the association or to the national organization of life and health insurance guaranty associations on its behalf, as soon as possible after commencement of formal delinquency proceedings:\n\n(a) copies of in-force contracts of reinsurance and all related files and records relevant to the determination of whether those contracts should be assumed; and\n\n(b) notices of defaults under the reinsurance contracts or a known event or condition that with the passage of time could become a default under the reinsurance contracts;\n\n(3) the following shall apply to reinsurance contracts assumed by the association:\n\n(a) the association shall be responsible for all unpaid premiums due under the reinsurance contracts for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation and shall be responsible for the performance of all other obligations to be performed after the date of the order of liquidation, in each case that relate to policies, contracts or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association. The association may charge policies, contracts or annuities covered in part by the association, through reasonable allocation methods, the costs for reinsurance in excess of the obligations of the association and shall provide notice and an accounting of these charges to the liquidator;\n\n(b) the association shall be entitled to amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods after the date of the order of liquidation and that relate to policies, contracts or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, provided that, upon receipt of those amounts, the association shall be obliged to pay to the beneficiary under the policy, contract or annuity on account of which the amounts were paid a portion of the amount equal to the lesser of: 1) the amount received by the association; and 2) the excess of the amount received by the association over the amount equal to the benefits paid by the association on account of the policy, contract or annuity less the retention of the insurer applicable to the loss or event;\n\n(c) within thirty days following the association's election, the association and each reinsurer under contracts assumed by the association shall calculate the net balance due to or from the association under each reinsurance contract as of the date of election with respect to policies, contracts or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, which calculation shall give full credit to all items paid by either the member insurer or its receiver or the reinsurer prior to the election date. The reinsurer shall pay the receiver amounts due for losses or events prior to the date of the order of liquidation, subject to a setoff for premiums unpaid for periods prior to that date, and the association or reinsurer shall pay any remaining balance due the other, in each case within five days of the completion of the calculation described in this subparagraph. A dispute over the amounts due to either the association or the reinsurer shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to the terms of the affected reinsurance contracts or, if the contract contains no arbitration clause, as otherwise provided by law. If the receiver has received amounts due the association pursuant to Subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, the receiver shall remit those amounts to the association as promptly as practicable; and\n\n(d) if the association or receiver, on the association's behalf, within sixty days of the election described in Subparagraph (c) of this paragraph, pays the unpaid premiums due for periods both before and after the date of election that relate to policies, contracts or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, the reinsurer shall not be entitled to terminate the reinsurance contracts for failure to pay premiums insofar as the reinsurance contracts relate to policies, contracts or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, and the reinsurer shall not be entitled to set off unpaid amounts due under other contracts, or unpaid amounts due from parties other than the association, against amounts due the association;\n\n(4) during the period from the date of the order of liquidation, until the election date or, if the election does not occur, until one hundred eighty days after the date of the order of liquidation, neither the association nor the reinsurer shall have rights or obligations pursuant to reinsurance contracts that the association has the right to assume pursuant to Paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection, whether for periods prior to or after the date of the order of liquidation, and the reinsurer, the receiver and the association shall, to the extent practicable, provide each other data and records reasonably requested; provided that once the association has elected to assume a reinsurance contract, the parties' rights and obligations shall be governed by Paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection;\n\n(5) if the association does not elect to assume a reinsurance contract by the election date pursuant to Paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection, the association shall have no rights or obligations, in each case for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation, with respect to the reinsurance contract;\n\n(6) when policies, contracts or annuities, or covered obligations with respect to those policies, contracts or annuities, are transferred to an assuming insurer, reinsurance on the policies or annuities may also be transferred by the association, in the case of contracts assumed pursuant to Paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection, subject to the following:\n\n(a) unless the reinsurer and the assuming insurer agree otherwise, the reinsurance contract transferred shall not cover new policies of insurance, contracts or annuities in addition to those transferred;\n\n(b) the obligations described in Paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection shall no longer apply with respect to matters arising after the effective date of the transfer; and\n\n(c) notice shall be given in writing, return receipt requested, by the transferring party to the affected reinsurer not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of the transfer;\n\n(7) the provisions of this subsection shall supersede the provisions of a state law or of an affected reinsurance contract that provides for or requires a payment of reinsurance proceeds, on account of losses or events that occur in periods after the date of the order of liquidation, to the receiver of the insolvent insurer or another person. The receiver shall remain entitled to amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods prior to the date of the order of liquidation, subject to applicable setoff provisions; and\n\n(8) except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the provisions of this subsection shall not:\n\n(a) alter or modify the terms and conditions of a reinsurance contract;\n\n(b) abrogate or limit the rights of a reinsurer to claim that it is entitled to rescind a reinsurance contract;\n\n(c) give a policyholder, contract owner, enrollee, certificate holder or beneficiary an independent cause of action against a reinsurer that is not otherwise set forth in the reinsurance contract;\n\n(d) limit or affect the association's rights as a creditor of the estate against the assets of the estate; or\n\n(e) apply to reinsurance contracts covering property or casualty risks.\n\nO. The board may exercise reasonable business judgment to determine the means by which the association is to provide the benefits of the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act in an economical and efficient manner.\n\nP. Where the association has arranged or offered to provide benefits to a covered person under a plan or arrangement that fulfills the association's obligations, the person shall not be entitled to benefits from the association in addition to or other than those provided under the plan or arrangement.\n\nQ.

      "text": "A. For the purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association, the board shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at a time and for amounts as the board finds necessary. Assessments shall be due not less than thirty days after prior written notice to the member insurers and shall accrue interest at six percent a year on and after the due date.\n\nB. There shall be two classes of assessments as follows:\n\n(1) class A assessments shall be authorized and called for the purpose of meeting administrative and legal costs and other expenses. Class A assessments may be authorized and called whether or not related to a particular impaired or insolvent insurer; and\n\n(2) class B assessments shall be authorized and called to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association with regard to an impaired or an insolvent insurer.\n\nC. The amount of a class A assessment shall be determined by the board and may be authorized and called on a pro rata or non-pro rata basis. If the class A assessment is authorized and called on a pro rata basis, the board may provide that it be credited against future class B assessments. The amount of a class B assessment, except for assessments related to long-term care insurance, shall be allocated for assessment purposes between the accounts and among the subaccounts of the life insurance and annuity account pursuant to an allocation formula that may be based on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or another standard deemed by the board in its sole discretion as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nD. The amount of the class B assessment for long-term care insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer shall be allocated according to a methodology included in the plan of operation and approved by the superintendent. The methodology shall provide for fifty percent of the assessment to be allocated to accident and health member insurers and fifty percent to be allocated to life and annuity member insurers.\n\nE. Class B assessments against member insurers for each account and subaccount shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this state by each assessed member insurer on policies or contracts covered by each account for the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the member insurer became insolvent or, in the case of an assessment with respect to an impaired insurer, the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the member insurer became impaired, bears to premiums received on business in this state for those calendar years by all assessed member insurers.\n\nF. Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer shall not be authorized or called until necessary to implement the purposes of the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act. Classification of assessments pursuant to Subsection B of this section and computation of assessments pursuant to Subsections C and E of this section shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible. The association shall notify each member insurer of its anticipated pro rata share of an authorized assessment not yet called within one hundred eighty days after the assessment is authorized.\n\nG. The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. In the event an assessment against a member insurer is abated, or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section. Once the conditions that caused a deferral have been removed or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were deferred pursuant to a repayment plan approved by the association.\n\nH. Subject to the provisions of Subsection I of this section, the total of all assessments authorized by the association with respect to a member insurer for each subaccount of the life insurance and annuity account and for the health insurance account shall not in one calendar year exceed two percent of that member insurer's average annual premiums received in this state on the policies and contracts covered by the subaccount or account during the three calendar years preceding the year in which the member insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\nI. If two or more assessments are authorized in one calendar year with respect to member insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different calendar years, the average annual premiums for purposes of the aggregate assessment percentage limitation referenced in Subsection H of this section shall be equal and limited to the higher of the three-year average annual premiums for the applicable subaccount or account as calculated pursuant to this section.\n\nJ. If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in an account, does not provide in one year in either account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act.\n\nK. The board may provide in the plan of operation a method of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one or more impaired or insolvent insurers, when the maximum assessment will be insufficient to cover anticipated claims.\n\nL. If the maximum assessment for a subaccount of the life and annuity account in one year does not provide an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, then pursuant to Subsection E of this section, the board shall access the other subaccounts of the life insurance and annuity account for the necessary additional amount, subject to the maximum stated in Subsections H, I and J of this section.\n\nM. The board may, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the board finds is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subrogation, net realized gains and income from investments. A reasonable amount may be retained in an account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the association and for a future losses claim.\n\nN. It shall be proper for a member insurer, in determining its premium rates and policyowner dividends as to any kind of insurance or health maintenance organization business within the scope of the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act, to consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under that act.\n\nO. The association shall issue to each member insurer paying an assessment, other than a class A assessment, a certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the superintendent, for the amount of the assessment paid. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contribution may be shown by the member insurer in its financial statement as an asset in that form and for that amount, if any, and period of time as the superintendent may approve.\n\nP. A protest to an assessment shall occur as follows:\n\n(1) a member insurer that wishes to protest all or part of an assessment shall pay when due the full amount of the assessment as set forth in the notice provided by the association. The payment shall be available to meet association obligations during the pendency of the protest or a subsequent appeal. Payment shall be accompanied by a statement in writing that the payment is made under protest and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds for the protest;\n\n(2) within sixty days following the payment of an assessment under protest by a member insurer, the association shall notify the member insurer in writing of its determination with respect to the protest unless the association notifies the member insurer that additional time is required to resolve the issues raised by the protest;\n\n(3) within thirty days after a final decision has been made, the association shall notify the protesting member insurer in writing of that final decision. Within sixty days of receipt of notice of the final decision, the protesting member insurer may appeal that final action to the superintendent;\n\n(4) in the alternative to rendering a final decision with respect to a protest based on a question regarding the assessment base, the association may refer protests to the superintendent for a final decision, with or without a recommendation from the association; and\n\n(5) if the protest or appeal on the assessment is upheld, the amount paid in error or excess shall be returned to the member insurer. Interest on a refund due a protesting member insurer shall be paid at the rate actually earned by the association.\n\nQ. The association may request information of member insurers in order to aid in the exercise of its power pursuant to this section, and member insurers shall promptly comply with a request.\n\nHistory:Laws 1984, ch. 127, § 757; repealed and reenacted by Laws 2012, ch. 9, § 11; 2024, ch. 36, § 6.\n\nThe 2024 amendment,effective January 1, 2025, revised certain assessments by the board against member insurers; in Subsection C, deleted \"The total of all non-pro rata assessments shall not exceed three hundred dollars ($300) per member insurer in one calendar year.\", after \"class B assessment\", added \"except for assessments related to long-term care insurance\" and after \"assessment purposes\" deleted \"among the accounts\" and added \"between the accounts and among the subaccounts of the life insurance and annuity account\"; added a new Subsection D and redesignated former Subsections D through P as Subsections E through Q, respectively; in Subsection L, after \"Subsections\", deleted \"G, H and I\" and added \"H, I and J\"; and in Subsection N, after \"kind of insurance\" added \"or health maintenance organization business\".\n\nApplicability.Laws 2024, ch. 36, § 12 provided that Laws 2024, ch. 36 shall not apply to any member insurer that was insolvent or unable to fulfill the member insurer's contractual obligations prior to January 1, 2025.",

No person, including a member insurer, agent or affiliate of a member insurer, shall make, publish, disseminate, circulate or place before the public, or cause directly or indirectly to be made, published, disseminated, circulated or placed before the public, in a newspaper, magazine or other publication, or in the form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter or poster, or over a radio station or television station, or in any other way, an advertisement, announcement or statement, written or oral, that uses the existence of the association for the purpose of sales, solicitation or inducement to purchase insurance or other coverage covered by the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act. However, this subsection shall not apply to the association or any other entity that does not sell or solicit insurance or coverage by a health maintenance organization.\n\nB. Within one hundred eighty days of the effective date of this act, the association shall prepare a summary document describing the general purposes and current limitations of that act and complying with Subsection C of this section. The document shall be submitted to the superintendent for approval. At the expiration of the sixtieth day after the date on which the superintendent approves the document, a member insurer shall not deliver a policy or contract to a policy owner, contract owner, certificate holder or enrollee unless the summary document is delivered to the policy owner, contract owner, certificate holder or enrollee at the time of delivery of the policy or contract. The document shall also be available upon request by a policy owner, contract owner, certificate holder or enrollee. The distribution, delivery or contents or interpretation of this document does not guarantee that either the policy or the contract or the policy owner, contract owner, certificate holder or enrollee is covered in the event of the impairment or insolvency of a member insurer. The description document shall be revised by the association as amendments to the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act may require. Failure to receive this document does not give the policy owner, contract owner, certificate holder or insured greater rights than those stated in the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act.\n\nC. The document prepared pursuant to Subsection B of this section shall contain a clear and conspicuous disclaimer on its face. The superintendent shall establish the form and content of the disclaimer.

A member insurer shall retain evidence of compliance with Subsection B of this section for as long as the policy or contract for which the notice is given remains in effect.\n\nHistory:Laws 2012, ch. 9, § 20; 2024, ch. 36, § 10.\n\nThe 2024 amendment,effective January 1, 2025, amended an existing exception to the prohibited advertisement provision to include entity's that do not sell or solicit coverage by a health maintenance organization; in Subsection A, after \"solicit insurance\" added \"or coverage by a health maintenance organization\"; and in Subsection B and Subsection C, Paragraphs C(2) and C(5), after \"contract owner\" added \"certificate holder or enrollee\", in Paragraph C(4), after \"form of insurance\" added \"or health maintenance organization coverage\", and in Paragraph C(5), after \"selecting an insurer\" added \"or health maintenance organization\".\n\nApplicability.Laws 2024, ch. 36, § 12 provided that Laws 2024, ch. 36 shall not apply to any member insurer that was insolvent or unable to fulfill the member insurer's contractual obligations prior to January 1, 2025.",
