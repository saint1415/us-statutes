Within the area and limits of coverage offered an insured and selected by the insured in the application for insurance, the right of a person to exercise full freedom of choice in the selection of a hospital for hospital care or of a practitioner of the healing arts or optometrist, psychologist, podiatrist, physician assistant, certified nurse-midwife, registered lay midwife or registered nurse in expanded practice, as defined in Subsection B of this section, for treatment of an illness or injury within that person's scope of practice shall not be restricted under any new policy of health insurance, contract or health care plan issued after June 30, 1967 in this state or in the processing of a claim thereunder. A person insured or claiming benefits under any such health insurance policy, contract or health care plan providing within its coverage for payment of service benefits or indemnity for hospital care or treatment of persons for the cure or correction of any physical or mental condition shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of the policy, contract or health care plan as to submission of proof of loss upon submitting written proof supported by the certificate of any hospital currently licensed by the department of health or any practitioner of the healing arts or optometrist, psychologist, podiatrist, physician assistant, certified nurse-midwife, registered lay midwife or registered nurse in expanded practice.\n\nB.

This section shall apply to any such policy that is delivered or issued for delivery in this state on or after July 1, 1979 and to any existing group policy or plan on its anniversary or renewal date after June 30, 1979 or at expiration of the applicable collective bargaining contract, if any, whichever is later.\n\nHistory:Laws 1984, ch. 127, § 454; 1985, ch. 192, § 1; 1987, ch. 81, § 1; 1987, ch. 259, § 21; 1989, ch. 96, § 1; 2003, ch. 343, § 2; 2008, ch. 9, § 5.\n\nCross references.— For drug prescriptive, distributing and administering authority of certified nurse midwives,see24-1-4.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2008 amendment,effective May 14, 2008, added \"physician assistant\" in Subsection A and added the definition of \"physician assistant\" in Paragraph (6) of Subsection B.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, substituted \"department of health\" for \"health and environment department\" throughout the section; in Paragraph B (2), deleted the reference to Chapter 61, Article 4, 5, 6, 10 or 14A NMSA 1978 and added Subparagraphs B(2)(a) through (e); in Paragraphs B(3) and (4) substituted a reference to the named act for the reverence to the chapter and article; in Paragraphs B(6) and (7), substituted \"public health division\" for \"health services division\".\n\nCompiler's notes.— The annotations appearing below were abstracted from attorney general opinions decided under former 59-18-19 NMSA 1978 which contained provisions similar to this section.\n\nInsurer may not designate practitioners.— This section provides that an insurer or health care plan may not limit the right of an insured or subscriber to select his own physician, nor may they restrict the choice of the insured or subscriber to a list of practitioners designated by the insurer or health care plan. To so restrict the freedom of choice of the insured or subscriber to a designated list of practitioners would be in clear contravention of this section. 1977 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 77-13.\n\nInsurer may not limit payments for particular profession.— An insurer or health care plan may not so limit the benefits to be paid for the services rendered by a particular profession of health care providers so as to effectively limit the freedom of choice of the insured or subscriber, and thus defeat the legislative mandate of the section. 1977 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 77-13.\n\nInsured may choose chiropractors.— The restriction of this section prohibiting discrimination against an insured in the choice of a practitioner of the healing arts, applies to chiropractors. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-58.\n\nLimits of insured's freedom of choice.— The section provides for freedom of choice by the insured or subscriber in the selection for health care treatment of a hospital or practitioner of the healing arts, optometrist or podiatrist. However, this freedom of choice is limited to those areas of coverage offered in the insurance policy or health care plan, and by the stated limits of the policy or plan. The choice of practitioner is also limited to treatment of an illness or injury that is within the scope of practice of the health care purveyor selected by the insured or subscriber. 1977 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 77-13.\n\nApplies to nonprofit health care plans.— Nonprofit health care plans organized under former 59-19-1 NMSA 1978 et seq. were required to comply with the provisions of this section relating to freedom of choice of a subscriber in the selection of a physician, osteopath, dentist or chiropractor. 1977 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 77-13.\n\nAccident and health insurance, contract or health care.— Under the language of this section, the freedom of choice provisions of this section are made applicable to policies of accident and health insurance, and to contract or health care plans. 1977 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 77-13.\n\nAm.

The clinical review criteria shall be based on clinical practice guidelines that:\n\n(1) recommend that the prescription drugs subject to step therapy protocols be taken in the specific sequence required by the step therapy protocol;\n\n(2) are developed and endorsed by an interdisciplinary panel of experts that manages conflicts of interest among the members of the panel of experts by:\n\n(a) requiring members to: 1) disclose any potential conflicts of interest with insurers, health maintenance organizations, health care plans, pharmacy benefits managers and any other entities; and 2) recuse themselves if there is a conflict of interest; and\n\n(b) using analytical and methodological experts to work to provide objectivity in data analysis and ranking of evidence through the preparation of evidence tables and facilitating consensus;\n\n(3) are based on high-quality studies, research and medical practice;\n\n(4) are created pursuant to an explicit and transparent process that:\n\n(a) minimizes bias and conflicts of interest;\n\n(b) explains the relationship between treatment options and outcomes;\n\n(c) rates the quality of the evidence supporting recommendations; and\n\n(d) considers relevant patient subgroups and preferences; and\n\n(5) take into account the needs of atypical patient populations and diagnoses.\n\nB. In the absence of clinical guidelines that meet the requirements of Subsection A of this section, peer-reviewed publications may be substituted.\n\nC. When a health insurance policy, health care plan or certificate of insurance restricts coverage of a prescription drug for the treatment of any medical condition through the use of a step therapy protocol, an insured and the practitioner prescribing the prescription drug shall have access to a clear, readily accessible and convenient process to request a step therapy exception determination. An insurer may use its existing medical exceptions process in accordance with the provisions of Subsections D through I of this section to satisfy this requirement. The process shall be made easily accessible for insureds and practitioners on the insurer's publicly accessible website.\n\nD. An insurer shall expeditiously grant an exception to the health insurance policy's, health care plan's or certificate of insurance's step therapy protocol, based on medical necessity and a clinically valid explanation from the patient's prescribing practitioner as to why a drug on the health insurance policy's, health care plan's or certificate of insurance's formulary that is therapeutically equivalent to the prescribed drug should not be substituted for the prescribed drug, if:\n\n(1) the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request is contraindicated or will likely cause an adverse reaction by or physical or mental harm to the patient;\n\n(2) the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request is expected to be ineffective based on the known clinical characteristics of the patient and the known characteristics of the prescription drug regimen;\n\n(3) while under the insured's current health insurance policy, health care plan or certificate of insurance, or under the insured's previous health coverage, the insured has tried the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class or with the same mechanism of action as the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request and that prescription drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness, diminished effect or an adverse event; or\n\n(4) the prescription drug required pursuant to the step therapy protocol is not in the best interest of the patient, based on clinical appropriateness, because the patient's use of the prescription drug is expected to:\n\n(a) cause a significant barrier to the patient's adherence to or compliance with the patient's plan of care;\n\n(b) worsen a comorbid condition of the patient; or\n\n(c) decrease the patient's ability to achieve or maintain reasonable functional ability in performing daily activities.\n\nE. Upon the granting of an exception to a health insurance policy's, health care plan's or certificate of insurance's step therapy protocol, an insurer shall authorize coverage for the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request for no less than the duration of the therapeutic effect of the drug. An insurer shall include in its evidence of coverage language describing an insured's rights pursuant to this subsection.\n\nF. An insurer shall respond with its decision on an insured's exception request within seventy-two hours of receipt. In cases where exigent circumstances exist, an insurer shall respond within twenty-four hours of receipt of the exception request. In the event the insurer does not respond to an exception request within the time frames required pursuant to this subsection, the exception request shall be granted.\n\nG. An insurer's denial of a request for an exception for step therapy protocols shall be subject to review and appeal pursuant to the Patient Protection Act [Chapter 59A, Article 57 NMSA 1978].\n\nH. After an insured has made an exception request in accordance with the provisions of this section, an insurer shall authorize continued coverage of a prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request pending the determination of the exception request.\n\nI. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to prevent:\n\n(1) a health insurance policy, health care plan or certificate of insurance from requiring a patient to try a biosimilar, interchangeable biologic or generic equivalent of a prescription drug before providing coverage for the equivalent brand-name prescription drug; or\n\n(2) a practitioner from prescribing a prescription drug that the practitioner has determined to be medically necessary.\n\nJ. The superintendent shall promulgate rules as may be necessary to appropriately implement the provisions of this section.\n\nK. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to interfere with the superintendent's authority to regulate prescription drug coverage benefits under other state and federal law.\n\nL. As used in this section, \"medical necessity\" or \"medically necessary\" means health care services determined by a practitioner, in consultation with the insurer, to be appropriate or necessary, according to:\n\n(1) any applicable, generally accepted principles and practices of good medical care;\n\n(2) practice guidelines developed by the federal government or national or professional medical societies, boards or associations; or\n\n(3) any applicable clinical protocols or practice guidelines developed by the insurer consistent with federal, national and professional practice guidelines. These standards shall be applied to decisions related to the diagnosis or direct care and treatment of a physical or behavioral health condition, illness, injury or disease.\n\nHistory:Laws 2018, ch. 9, § 3; 2024, ch. 42, § 3.\n\nThe 2024 amendment,effective May 15, 2024, modified the guidelines relating to step therapy for prescription drug coverage, required a health insurance policy's health care plan, upon the granting of an exception to step therapy protocol, to authorize coverage for the prescription drug that is the subject of the exception request for no less than the duration of the therapeutic effect of the drug, and provided that in addition to a health insurance policy's health plan's current authority to require a patient to try a generic equivalent of a prescription drug before providing coverage for the equivalent brand-name prescription drug, the health care plan may now require a patient to try a biosimilar, interchangeable biologic drug before providing coverage for a brand-name prescription; in Subsection E, added \"for no less than the duration of the therapeutic effect of the drug. An insurer shall include in its evidence of coverage language describing an insured's rights pursuant to this subsection.\"; in Subsection I, Paragraph I(1), after \"patient to try a\" added \"biosimilar, interchangeable biologic or\"; and deleted former Subsection J and redesignated former Subsections K through M as Subsection J through L, respectively.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2024, ch. 42, § 7 provided that the provisions of Sections 1 and 3 through 6 [13-7-18, 59A-22-53.1, 59A-22B-8, 59A-46-52.1, 59A-47-47.1 NMSA 1978] of this act do not apply to short-term plans subject to the Short-Term Health Plan and Excepted Benefit Act [Chapter 59A, Article 23G NMSA 1978].\n\nLaws 2024, ch. 42, § 8 provided that the provisions of Laws 2024, ch. 42 apply to group health insurance policies, health care plans or certificates of health insurance, other than small group health plans, that are delivered, issued for delivery or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2025.",

      "text": "A. An individual health plan that is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed in this state that offers coverage for prosthetic and custom orthotic devices shall consider these benefits habilitative or rehabilitative benefits for purposes of any state or federal requirement for coverage of essential health benefits.\n\nB. When performing a utilization review for a request for coverage of prosthetic or orthotic benefits, an insurer shall apply the most recent version of evidence-based treatment and fit criteria as recognized by relevant clinical specialists or their organizations. Such standards may be named by the superintendent in rule.\n\nC. An insurer shall render utilization review determinations in a nondiscriminatory manner and shall not deny coverage for habilitative or rehabilitative benefits, including prosthetics or orthotics, solely on the basis of an insured's actual or perceived disability.\n\nD. An insurer shall not deny a prosthetic or orthotic benefit for an individual with limb loss or absence that would otherwise be covered for a non-disabled person seeking medical or surgical intervention to restore or maintain the ability to perform the same physical activity.\n\nE. A health benefits plan that is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed in this state that offers coverage for prosthetics and custom orthotic devices shall include language describing an insured's rights pursuant to Subsections C and D of this section in its evidence of coverage and any benefit denial letters.\n\nF. Prosthetic and custom orthotic device coverage shall not be subject to separate financial requirements that are applicable only with respect to that coverage. An individual health plan may impose cost sharing on prosthetic or custom orthotic devices; provided that any cost-sharing requirements shall not be more restrictive than the cost-sharing requirements applicable to the plan's coverage for inpatient physician and surgical services.\n\nG. A health plan that provides coverage for prosthetic or orthotic services shall ensure access to medically necessary clinical care and to prosthetic and custom orthotic devices and technology from not less than two distinct prosthetic and custom orthotic providers in the managed care plan's provider network located in the state. In the event that medically necessary covered orthotics and prosthetics are not available from an in-network provider, the insurer shall provide processes to refer a member to an out-of-network provider and shall fully reimburse the out-of-network provider at a mutually agreed upon rate less member cost sharing determined on an in-network basis.\n\nH. If coverage for prosthetic or custom orthotic devices is provided, payment shall be made for the replacement of a prosthetic or custom orthotic device or for the replacement of any part of such devices, without regard to continuous use or useful lifetime restrictions, if an ordering health care provider determines that the provision of a replacement device, or a replacement part of such a device, is necessary because of any of the following:\n\n(1) a change in the physiological condition of the patient;\n\n(2) an irreparable change in the condition of the device or in a part of the device; or\n\n(3) the condition of the device, or the part of the device, requires repairs and the cost of such repairs would be more than sixty percent of the cost of a replacement device or of the part being replaced.\n\nI. Confirmation from a prescribing health care provider may be required if the prosthetic or custom orthotic device or part being replaced is less than three years old.\n\nJ. The provisions of this section do not apply to excepted benefits plans subject to the Short-Term Health Plan and Excepted Benefit Act [Chapter 59A, Article 23G NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:Laws 2023, ch. 196, § 3.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2023, ch. 196, § 7 made Laws 2023, ch. 196, § 3 effective January 1, 2024.",
