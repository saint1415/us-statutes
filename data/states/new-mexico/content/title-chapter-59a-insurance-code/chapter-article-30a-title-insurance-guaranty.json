In no event shall the association be obligated to a policyholder in an amount in excess of the obligation of the insolvent insurer under the policy;\n\n(2) be deemed the insolvent insurer to the extent of the insurer's obligation on covered claims and to such extent shall have all rights, duties and obligations of the insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent; provided that the association shall have no liability for any past claims based on negligence of the insurer or its agents in searching and reporting the condition of a title, on bad faith of the insolvent insurer, on the closing of any transaction or for exemplary or punitive damages;\n\n(3) pay for the administration and operation of the association from the administrative account, through proceeds received from an annual guaranty fee to be collected in the amounts and manner established by rule of the superintendent;\n\n(4) allocate claims payments, loss and adjustment expense and administrative expense to the appropriate accounts and assess member insurers, separately for each account, amounts necessary to pay the association's obligations subsequent to an insolvency. Assessments shall not be made in a year in which guaranty fee proceeds, together with unencumbered account balances and other assets, will be sufficient to satisfy the association's obligations. Assessments shall be made against each member insurer in the proportion that the member insurer's net written premiums for the last full calendar year bears to net written premiums of all member insurers for that calendar year. Each member insurer shall be notified of the assessment not later than thirty days before it is due. No member insurer may be assessed in a year an amount greater than two percent of that member insurer's net written premiums for the preceding calendar year. If it appears that the maximum assessment available, together with unencumbered account balances and other assets, will be insufficient in a year to make all necessary payments, the association's obligations shall be paid pro rata and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon as additional assessment proceeds or other funds become available. The association may pay claims in an order that it deems reasonable, including payments as claims are received or by groups or categories of claims. The association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if the assessment would cause the member insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority in any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance. Each member insurer acting as a servicing facility may set off against an assessment any authorized payments made on covered claims and expenses incurred in the payment of the claims by such member insurer if they are chargeable to the account for which the assessment is made;\n\n(5) investigate claims and adjust, compromise, settle and pay covered claims to the extent of the association's obligations, and deny all other claims.
