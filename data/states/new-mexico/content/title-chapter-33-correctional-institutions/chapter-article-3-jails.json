The common jails shall be under the control of the respective sheriffs, independent contractors or jail administrators hired by the board of county commissioners or other local public body or combination thereof, and the same shall be used as prisons in the respective counties.\n\nB. Contracts between local public bodies and private independent contractors for the operation, or provision and operation, of a jail are specifically authorized by this section; provided that prior to July 1, 1987, no more than two pilot projects involving private independent contractors are authorized in New Mexico, pursuant to Section 33-3-26 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:Laws 1865-1866, ch. 19, § 1; C.L. 1884, § 468; C.L. 1897, § 821; Code 1915, § 3033; C.S. 1929, § 75-101; 1941 Comp., § 45-201; 1953 Comp., § 42-2-1; Laws 1983, ch. 181, § 3; 1984, ch. 22, § 4.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The 1915 Code compilers, in Subsection A, deleted \"now standing or that may hereafter be built in the different counties of the territory\" after \"common jails\" and deleted \"for the purposes in this act provided\" from the end of the section.\n\nCross references.— For the definition of jail administrator,see4-44-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor bond issues for jails,see4-49-1 to 4-49-21 NMSA 1978.\n\nGuadalupe County correctional facility's contractwith the board of commissioners of Guadalupe County, a contract which is specifically authorized by law, vested the facility's employees with the authority to act as jailers.State v. Young, 2004-NMSC-015, 135 N.M. 458, 90 P.3d 477.\n\nTransportation of prisonershoused at a county jail or other detention facility is not the exclusive responsibility of the local sheriff's department; jail administrators and independent contractors may also transport inmates at their facilities. 2000 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 00-02.\n\nMunicipal jail not \"common jail\" even if only one.— When a municipal jail is the only jail in a county, this does not cause it to become a \"common jail\" within the meaning of this section. Therefore, it is not subject to the control of the county sheriff. 1976 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 76-18.\n\nNo authority to refuse prisoners.— County jail administrators have no authority to refuse to accept persons who have been properly committed to their custody by state or federal authorities. 1994 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 94-08.\n\nCounty commissioners may not arbitrarily decide how sheriff's space used.— While Sections 4-38-13 and 4-38-18 NMSA 1978 grant the board of county commissioners the authority to control and manage county property, this does not mean the board may arbitrarily decide how space assigned to the county sheriff may be used. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-50.\n\nJails are under sheriff's control, irrespective of duty to inspect.— While the county commissioners have the duty to inspect jails at least twice a year, the jails are under the control of the sheriffs of the respective counties. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-50.\n\nSheriff may provide quarters for jailer and his familyin space assigned to the sheriff, for that purpose, convenient to the jail. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-50.\n\nNo authority to contract with independent contractors for jail services.— This section, which is the basic authorization for county jails, does not authorize counties to contract with private independent contractors for jail services, as it does not authorize anyone other than a sheriff or hired jail administrator to control a county jail. 1983 Op.

Hughes, 1918-NMSC-094, 24 N.M. 421, 174 P. 425.\n\nCounty may refuse use of jail by city without arrangement.— Neither the sheriff nor the county commissioners may limit use of the facilities of the county jail if the city has been using the jail with the county commissioners' consent, but if no such consent has ever been obtained by the city, then the county commissioners may refuse until some satisfactory arrangement is made by the county commissioners and the city. 1952 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 52-5608.\n\nPersons violating state law confined to county jail pending appeal.— Those persons convicted of violation of state laws are to be committed to the county jail, and a municipality should not be forced to accept or pay for their upkeep while they are appealing to the district court. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-21.\n\nResponsibility for expenses and upkeep of prisoners.— A county becomes responsible for paying the expenses and upkeep of prisoners arrested by municipal police on state charges at such times as the prisoners are delivered to the actual custody of the county jail, along with any necessary paperwork; a county becomes responsible for medical costs of indigent prisoners at the same time and in the same circumstances. 1985 Op.

County of Santa Fe, 213 F. Supp. 2d 1288 (D.N.M. 2002).\n\nIrrespective of duty to inspect, sheriffs have control of jail.— While the county commissioners have the duty to inspect jails at least twice (now once) a year, the jails are under the control of the sheriffs of the respective counties. 1969 Op.

The sheriff or jail administrator of any county, with the approval of the committing judge or presiding judge, may grant any person imprisoned in the county jail a deduction of time from the term of his sentence for good behavior and industry and shall establish rules for the accrual of \"good time\". Deductions of time shall not exceed one-half of the term of the prisoner's original sentence. If a prisoner is under two or more cumulative sentences, the sentences shall be treated as one sentence for the purpose of deducting time for good behavior.\n\nB. A prisoner shall not accrue good time for the mandatory portion of a sentence imposed pursuant to the provisions of:\n\n(1) Sections 66-8-102 and 66-5-39 NMSA 1978; or\n\n(2) a county or municipal ordinance that prohibits driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, or driving with a revoked or suspended driver's license.\n\nC. A part or all of the prisoner's accrued deductions may be forfeited for any conduct violation. The sheriff or jail administrator shall establish rules and procedures for the forfeiture of accrued deductions and keep a record of all forfeitures of accrued deductions and the reasons for the forfeitures. In addition, any independent contractor shall also keep a duplicate record of such forfeitures.\n\nD. No other time allowance or credits in addition to deductions of time permitted under this section may be granted to any prisoner.\n\nE. If a private independent contractor operates a jail, he shall make reports of disciplinary violations and good behavior to the sheriff of the county in which the jail is located. All action on such reports and awards or forfeitures of good time shall be made by the sheriff. The independent contractor shall not have the power to award or cause the forfeiture of good time pursuant to this section.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 42-2-7.1, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 207, § 1; 1983, ch. 181, § 10; 1984, ch. 22, § 11; 1993, ch. 134, § 1; 1995, ch. 112, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For the definition of jail administrator,see4-44-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, in Subsection A, substituted \"of any county, with the approval of the committing judge or presiding judge, may\" for \"as defined in Section 4-44-19 NMSA 1978 of any county shall\" in the first sentence, deleted \"except when a prisoner is being credited with good time due to community service work that he is performing\" from the end of the second sentence, and deleted the third through fifth sentences regarding deductions for community services; added Subsection B; and redesignated former Subsections B through D as Subsections C through E.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, in Subsection A, in the first sentence, inserted \"as defined in Section 4-44-19 NMSA 1978\", deleted \"with the approval of the district judge or committing judge, may\" following the first occurrence of \"county\" and made two stylistic changes, in the second sentence, substituted \"one-half\" for \"one-third\" and added the language following \"original sentence\", and inserted the third, fourth, and fifth sentences; and, in Subsection B, inserted \"establish rules and procedures for the forfeiture of accrued deductions and\" in the second sentence.\n\nThis section does not require a sentencing judge to grant a convicted person the opportunity to earn good time credits while in jail.State v. Wyman, 2008-NMCA-113, 144 N.M. 701, 191 P.3d 559, cert. quashed, 2009-NMCERT-012, 147 N.M. 600, 227 P.3d 90.\n\nConstitutionality of good time credit scheme.— New Mexico's good time credit statutory scheme does not offend the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law; it is reasonable not to award good time credits for presentence confinement to detainees who are presumed innocent and therefore are not yet subject to rehabilitation efforts or to compulsory labor requirements, especially when they are held without systematic evaluation in county jails lacking rehabilitation programs.State v. Aqui, 1986-NMSC-048, 104 N.M. 345, 721 P.2d 771, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 917, 107 S. Ct. 321, 93 L. Ed. 2d 294 (1986).\n\nNew Mexico's statutory scheme making prisoners eligible for awards of good time credits for the periods of their post-sentencing confinement in Correction Department facilities and county jails but not for the periods of their presentence confinement in county jails does not offend the due process guarantees of the New Mexico and United States constitutions.State v. Aqui, 1986-NMSC-048, 104 N.M. 345, 721 P.2d 771, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 917, 107 S. Ct. 321, 93 L. Ed. 2d 294 (1986).\n\nFailure to allow good time credit for presentence confinement does not subject a prisoner to double jeopardy.Enright v. State, 1986-NMSC-070, 104 N.M. 672, 726 P.2d 349.\n\nNew Mexico's statutory scheme, which does not allow good time credit for presentence confinement, does not offend the equal protection and due process guarantees of the New Mexico and United States constitutions.Enright v. State, 1986-NMSC-070, 104 N.M. 672, 726 P.2d 349.\n\nApplicability of good time credits.— Good time credits are available only to convicted and sentenced prisoners and did not apply to the defendant who was incarcerated between the date of the crime and the trial.State v. Landgraf, 1996-NMCA-024, 121 N.M. 445, 913 P.2d 252, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 375, 911 P.2d 883.\n\nDiscretion of administrators.— Deduction of good time credits from an inmate's sentence is a discretionary matter entrusted not to the courts but to the administrators of the corrections department or the county jails.State v. Aqui, 1986-NMSC-048, 104 N.M. 345, 721 P.2d 771, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 917, 107 S. Ct. 321, 93 L.

The fact that the correctional facility housed inmates from the department of corrections rather than county inmates is immaterial both for the definition of \"local jail\" in this section and the definition of \"penal institution\" in Section 31-20A-5 NMSA 1978.State v.
