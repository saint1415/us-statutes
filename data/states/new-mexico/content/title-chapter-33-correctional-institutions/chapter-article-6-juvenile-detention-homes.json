The board [boards] of county commissioners of counties in this state are hereby authorized and empowered to establish and equip juvenile detention homes and for that purpose to issue bonds of such counties in any sum necessary. Such juvenile detention homes are hereby declared to be necessary public buildings. In counties in this state where juvenile detention homes have been established, the board [boards] of county commissioners of those counties are hereby authorized and empowered to add rooms onto the original structure or erect additional buildings and for that purpose to issue bonds of such counties in any sum necessary.\n\nB. Whenever there is more than one county within a judicial district, the board of county commissioners of each such county is hereby authorized to enter into an agreement with one or more of the counties within the same judicial district providing for the establishment and equipment of one juvenile detention home to be located in said judicial district, to spend funds of the county for establishment and equipment of such juvenile detention home and to allocate the cost thereof among the participating counties on such basis as may be agreed upon by each board of county commissioners. For the purpose of providing funds for a juvenile detention home to be established and equipped under the provisions of this section, each participating county is hereby authorized to issue the bonds of its county in any sum necessary to meet such county's share of the cost.\n\nHistory:Laws 1939, ch. 75, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 45-602; 1953 Comp., § 42-6-2; Laws 1953, ch. 12, § 1; 1976, ch. 42, § 3.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For the children, youth and families department,see9-2A-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor detention facilities under Children's Code,see32A-2-4 and 32A-2-12 NMSA 1978.\n\nJuvenile detention home for county of first class was necessary public building within provision of constitution(N.M.
