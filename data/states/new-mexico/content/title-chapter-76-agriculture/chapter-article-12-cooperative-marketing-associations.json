      "text": "A. When a member of an association has paid his membership fee or stock subscription in full he shall receive, as the case may be, a certificate of membership or a stock certificate.\n\nB. No association shall issue membership certificates or stock until they have been fully paid for, but an association in its bylaws may admit a member and allow him to vote and hold office as soon as twenty per centum (20%) of his membership fee or his stock certificate has been paid.\n\nC. An association shall limit the interest it pays on membership capital or stock to an amount not greater than eight percent (8%) per annum. Such apportionment shall not be made until not less than ten (10%) percent of any undistributed balance accruing since the last apportionment, has been set aside in a surplus or reserve fund unless such surplus or reserve fund equal [equals] at least one hundred (100%) percent of the paid up membership fees or capital stock.\n\nD. Undistributed balances from any source, in excess of additions to reserves and surplus, shall be distributed on the basis of patronage, that is according to the amount or value, as the association may decide, of the products sold to or through, and/or purchased from or through, the association by its patrons. The distribution of such balances may be restricted to members or be made at the same or a different rate for members and nonmembers. The bylaws may provide that any distribution to a nonmember, eligible for membership may be credited to such nonmember until the amount thereof equals the value of a membership certificate or a share of the association's common stock. Such a distribution credited to the account of a nonmember shall revert to the reserve fund to be used for educational purposes if, after two years, the amount is less than the value of a membership certificate or a share of common stock, or in case said person does not accept and exercise his membership privileges.\n\nE. Ownership of common stock and/or membership certificates may be transferred by a member only to other associations or to persons engaged in the production of agricultural products, and who are eligible to hold same. Such transfer must be approved by the board of directors before it is binding on the association.\n\nF. An association may issue and sell preferred stock to members or nonmembers. Preferred stock may be redeemable or retirable by the association on such terms and conditions as may be provided by the bylaws and printed on the stock certificate. Preferred stockholders shall not be entitled to vote. Whenever an association organized hereunder with preferred stock shall purchase the stock or any interest in any property of any person it may discharge the obligation so incurred wholly or in part by exchanging for the acquired interest shares of its preferred stock to an amount which would equal the fair market value of the stock or interest so purchased as determined by the board of directors.\n\nHistory:Laws 1937, ch. 152, § 12; 1941 Comp., § 48-1312; 1953 Comp., § 45-14-12.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nIntent of legislature in establishing required reservein Subsection C was to assure protection of the association's creditors by establishing an adequate reserve fund and to establish a means for maintaining capital in the association. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-149.\n\nOnly common stock to be included in reserve fund requirement.— Because, in a stock association, the holders of common stock are the members of the association, but the preferred stockholders are not members and do not have a voice in the control of the corporation, the intention of the legislature was to include only common stock in the reserve fund requirement of Subsection C for stock associations. 1963 Op.

If the members in the association contract a sale to or through the association the fact that for certain purposes the relation between the association and its members may be one of agency shall not prevent the passage from the member to the association of absolute and exclusive title to the products which are the subject matter of the contract. Such title shall pass to the association upon delivery of the product or at any other specified time which may be expressly and distinctly agreed upon in the contract subject to previously existing liens. In the case of contracts with members who are natural persons, if the period of the contract exceeds three years, the contracts executed thereunder shall specify a reasonable period in each year during which the member by giving to the association such reasonable notice as may be prescribed in the contract may withdraw and be released from his obligations, subject to liability already incurred by him as a member of the association. In the absence of a provision for notice of withdrawal in the contract a member who is a natural person may withdraw at any time after three years subject to liabilities already incurred.\n\nB. The contract may fix, as liquidated damages, which shall not be regarded as penalties, specific sums to be paid by the member to the association upon the breach of any provision of the contract regarding the use of any facilities of the association or the sale or delivery or withholding of products and may further provide that the member who breaks his contract shall pay all costs, premiums for bonds, expenses and fees, in case any action is brought upon the contract by the association.\n\nC. In the event of any breach or threatened breach of such a contract by a member, the association shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent the breach of the contract and to a decree of specific performance thereof. Pending the adjudication of such an action and upon filing a verified complaint showing the breach or threatened breach, the association shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the member.\n\nD. The association may cause the original of a contract or an authenticated copy thereof to be filed in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the products described in the contract, or any part thereof, are or will at some future time be situated. Such contracts shall describe the property or services affected, the manner in which they are affected and the time for which they are affected and shall state the names and residences of the parties to the contract.\n\nThe filing of a contract in conformity to the provisions of this section shall operate as notice thereof to all subsequent purchasers and incumbrancers of so much of said property as is at the time mentioned in the contract located in the county or counties wherein such contract or authenticated copy thereof is filed; provided that when property subject to such a contract is moved into this state, or from one county to another, any previous filing of the contract shall not operate as notice as against subsequent creditors, purchasers, mortgagees or encumbrancers for a longer period than one hundred twenty days after such removal, but such contract must be refiled in the county to which the chattel is removed and in which it is permanently located. The fees for filing such contracts shall be twenty-five cents (25 ) for each contract.\n\nE. Whenever such contract shall have terminated, the association shall on demand give to the member a certificate to that effect, which may be filed with the county clerk. The county clerk shall be entitled to the same filing fees under this subsection as in the case of chattel mortgages.\n\nHistory:Laws 1937, ch. 152, § 16; 1941 Comp., § 48-1316; 1953 Comp., § 45-14-16.\n\nCross references.— For injunctions,seeRule 1-066 NMRA.\n\nCompiler's notes.— For similar provisions in earlier act,seeLaws 1925, ch. 99, §§ 13, 20 and 21.\n\nContract enforceable.— Cooperative marketing association without capital stock and operated for mutually beneficial purpose could enforce performance of grower's contract to sell alfalfa to it exclusively, in suit for specific performance or for injunction against contract breach; rule that contract for delivery of ordinary article of commerce would not be compelled by specific performance was not applicable, as action for damages would not afford adequate remedy.Elephant Butte Alfalfa Ass'n v.
