The state treasurer shall appoint the state cash manager, who shall manage efficiently all state cash balances in the custody of the state not otherwise invested or deposited, and in consultation with the state board of finance perform the duties necessary to carry out that management responsibility.\n\nB. The duties of the state cash manager include:\n\n(1) issuance of cash management regulations, procedures and enforcement policy to assure implementation of and compliance with the federal Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 and other provisions of law;\n\n(2) obtaining from each state agency periodic reports of all money from any source in the agency's custody, including detailed information on receipts, disbursements and balances on hand or on deposit in a financial institution;\n\n(3) periodic review of all deposits made and balances on hand to assure that all money received by each state agency is deposited in a timely manner in the state fiscal agent bank and, if applicable, to the state agency's account in the state treasury;\n\n(4) projection of the state's short-term and long-term cash needs to determine the amount available for short-term and long-term investment;\n\n(5) determination and periodic update of the warrant clearance pattern to project the time lag between warrant issuance date and warrant clearance date to facilitate cash management activities; and\n\n(6) preparation of a monthly written report showing state fund balances in each financial institution and sending the report to the state board of finance, the legislative finance committee, the state investment council, the educational retirement board and the retirement board of the public employees retirement association.\n\nC. In addition to the specific duties in Subsection B of this section, the state cash manager shall ensure that non-income producing state cash balances are kept to a minimum in accordance with established guidelines. The state cash manager shall report any actual or anticipated deviations from such established guidelines to the state board of finance, the investing board or council, and the legislative finance committee.\n\nD. The state cash manager shall have access to all accounts, files and other records of funds in the custody of the state. Upon approval of the state board of finance, the state cash manager may conduct any periodic investigation he deems necessary to enable him to perform his duties pursuant to this section.\n\nE.

Laws 1897, § 2597 was a general limitation upon the authority of the auditor, under which he could audit only such accounts as had been expressly allowed by acts passed, and he was required to report claims not so allowed to the next legislative assembly for its action thereon.Garcia v. Territory ex. rel. Bursum, 1900-NMSC-006, 10 N.M. 43, 61 P. 207.\n\nConstruction.— When Laws 1957, chs. 248 and 252, were construed by the rule of \"pari materia\" the supreme court found the duties of the auditor substantially the same as previously performed by him, except preaudit duties and the duty of issuing warrants, which duties had been transferred to the director of the department of finance and administration (now secretary of finance and administration) by the 1957 act.Torres v. Grant, 1957-NMSC-061, 63 N.M. 106, 314 P.2d 712.\n\nConstitutionality.— Laws 1957, ch. 252, providing warrants on state funds may be drawn only by director of department of finance and administration (now secretary of finance and administration), was not unconstitutional on theory that it removed from the state auditor, a constitutional officer, substantially all the powers and duties of that office.Torres v. Grant, 1957-NMSC-061, 63 N.M. 106, 314 P.2d 712.\n\nEffect of approval of warrant.— The warrant of the superintendent of insurance on the insurance fund, approved by the auditor (now secretary of finance and administration), was not the warrant of the auditor (now secretary).State ex rel.
