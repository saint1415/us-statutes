GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nDiscretion to determine public interest.— The language of this section grants the attorney general discretion in determining when the public interest requires him to bring a civil action on behalf of the state.State ex rel. Bingaman v. Valley Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 1981-NMSC-108, 97 N.M. 8, 636 P.2d 279.\n\nHistorical.— In the Act of 1859, the duties of the attorney general were coextensive with the territory; but by the Act of 1862, his duties were expressly limited to the supreme court and district courts of the first and second districts. In the Act of January 28, 1863, § 25, the territorial limits within which the attorney general was to exercise his duties was again reduced and restricted to the first judicial district.Territory ex rel. Wade v. Ashenfelter, 1887-NMSC-013, 4 N.M. (Gild.) 93, 12 P. 879, appeal dismissed, 154 U.S. 493, 14 S. Ct. 1141, 38 L. Ed. 1079 (1893).\n\nAttorney general has no common-law powers or duties.State ex rel. Norvell v. Credit Bureau of Albuquerque, Inc., 1973-NMSC-087, 85 N.M. 521, 514 P.2d 40.\n\nThe office of attorney general in New Mexico was created by statute, and its powers and duties defined and limited by statute from its inception. No common-law powers were confirmed in the office of attorney general by the constitution ofNew Mexico. State v. Davidson, 1929-NMSC-016, 33 N.M. 664, 275 P. 373.\n\nWaiving sovereign immunity.— The attorney general's authority is broad enough to include making litigation decisions such as waiving an immunity defense.Abreau v. N.M. Children, Youth and Families Dep't, 646 F.Supp. 2d 1259 (D.N.M. 2009).\n\nSection 8-5-2 NMSA 1978, which specifies the powers of the attorney general, does not expressly confer on the attorney general the authority to waive Eleventh Amendment immunity.Guttman v. Khalsa, 320 F.Supp. 2d 1164 (D.N.M. 2003).\n\nII. SUPREME COURT AND COURT OF APPEALS.\n\nAttorney general must represent state in any appeal.State ex rel. Maloney v. Sierra, 1970-NMSC-144, 82 N.M. 125, 477 P.2d 301.\n\nFiling of brief by special assistant attorney general.— Where brief erroneously filed by district attorney was ordered stricken and attorney general and regular assistants disqualified, the special assistant attorney general was allowed 20 days in which to file a brief on the merits.State v. Aragon, 1950-NMSC-053, 55 N.M. 421, 234 P.2d 356.\n\nIII. OTHER COURTS.\n\nDisqualification of attorney general.— The attorney general is the state's highest ranking law enforcement officer, elected by the people of New Mexico. For a court to forbid the attorney general from engaging in a prosecution within the jurisdiction of the office is a serious encroachment on the executive branch. The disqualification of the attorney general is an action that should be undertaken with the greatest circumspection.State v. Armijo, 1994-NMCA-136, 118 N.M. 802, 887 P.2d 1269; cert. denied, 119 N.M. 20, 888 P.2d 466.\n\nThe approval as to form of a contract that was the subject of a criminal prosecution by the attorney general for financial impropriety was not grounds for disqualifying the attorney general.State v. Armijo, 1994-NMCA-136, 118 N.M. 802, 887 P.2d 1269; cert. denied, 119 N.M. 20, 888 P.2d 466.\n\nDuty to prosecute.— Attorney general is charged by statute with the duty of prosecuting in court any action when in his judgment the interest of the state requires such action.State ex rel. Maloney v. Sierra, 1970-NMSC-144, 82 N.M. 125, 477 P.2d 301.\n\nProsecution in federal court.— The attorney general may delegate the power to institute juvenile proceedings in federal court to U.S. attorneys.U.S. v. Dennison, 652 F. Supp.211 )D.N.M. 1986).\n\nProtecting state's interests.— Inherent in the attorney general's duty to \"prosecute\" is the power to initiate civil lawsuits when, in his judgment, the interest of the state is in need of protection.State ex rel. Bingaman v. Valley Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 1981-NMSC-108, 97 N.M. 8, 636 P.2d 279.\n\nProsecution of actions.— This section and 8-5-3 NMSA 1978 permit the attorney general to bring an action on behalf of the state if no other provision has been made for it to be brought, or to step into litigation brought by another where the interests of the state are not being adequately represented or protected.State v. Koehler, 1981-NMSC-060, 96 N.M. 293, 629 P.2d 1222.\n\nReal party in interest.— The attorney general's duty of prosecuting any action when, in his judgment, the interest of the state is present, makes him a real party in interest.State ex rel. Bingaman v. Valley Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 1981-NMSC-108, 97 N.M. 8, 636 P.2d 279.\n\nRight to maintain suit in water-law cases.— The attorney general may maintain suit on behalf of state to enjoin use of unappropriated water for irrigation contrary to law.State ex rel. Bliss v. Dority, 1950-NMSC-066, 55 N.M. 12, 225 P.2d 1007, appeal dismissed, 341 U.S. 924, 71 S. Ct. 798, 95 L. Ed. 1356 (1951).\n\nIV. STATE OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES.\n\nGovernor as defendant to constitutional challenge.— The governor, as represented by the attorney general, because of his ability to influence the prosecution of violators, is the proper defendant in an action alleging that the statute prohibiting dissemination of \"harmful\" material to a minor over a computer network is facially invalid on First Amendment grounds.American Civil Liberties Union v. Johnson, 4 F. Supp. 2d 1024 (D.N.M. 1998), aff'd, 194 F.3d 1149 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\nAttorney general's prosecution of state officer he formerly represented.— The appointment of the New Mexico attorney general, and a deputy attorney general, to act as special assistant United States attorneys for prosecution of criminal charges against the state investment officer and an assistant state treasurer alleging a conspiracy to extort a political contribution involved no inherent or actual conflict of interest under the rules of professional responsibility or this section. An inherent conflict of interest does not arise merely because a state attorney general prosecutes a state officer whom he formerly represented.United States v. Troutman, 814 F.2d 1428 (10th Cir. 1987).\n\nRepresentation of state corporation commission (now public regulation commission) and customers.— The attorney general's representation both of the state corporation commission (now public regulation commission) and of unrepresented customers of a utility is proper. His representation of other parties before the commission is not a conflict of interest and not a violation of his constitutional duty to represent the commission.Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Corporation Comm'n, 1982-NMSC-127, 99 N.M. 1, 653 P.2d 501.\n\nV. DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.\n\nNo right to displace generally.— Nothing in this section suggests a right in the attorney general to displace the district attorney in a case where the rights of the state are being actively advocated.State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Reese, 1967-NMSC-172, 78 N.M. 241, 430 P.2d 399.\n\nRelation between attorney general and district attorneys.— There is nothing in the laws making the attorney general the superior of the district attorneys. The most that can be said concerning the powers of the attorney general in this section is that it gives concurrent right with the district attorney to bring an action, and there is nothing in this section which remotely suggests a right to supplant or take over from a district attorney who is performing his legal duties.State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Reese, 1967-NMSC-172, 78 N.M. 241, 430 P.2d 399.\n\nAppeal of criminal cases.— District attorney has authority to take an appeal, but it is the prerogative and duty of the attorney general to brief the case and to present it in the supreme court, and a district attorney may appear on appeal in a criminal case only by permission of the attorney general and in association with him.State v. Aragon, 1950-NMSC-053, 55 N.M. 421, 234 P.2d 356.\n\nVI. OPINIONS.\n\nWeight given by supreme court.— The supreme court is not bound by attorney general opinions, and gives them such weight only as it deems they merit and no more. If the court thinks the opinions are right, it follows and approves, and if convinced they are wrong the court rejects them.City of Santa Rosa v. Jaramillo, 1973-NMSC-119, 85 N.M. 747, 517 P.2d 69;First Thrift & Loan Ass'n v. State ex rel. Robinson, 1956-NMSC-099, 62 N.M. 61, 304 P.2d 582;Perea v. Board of Torrance County Comm'rs, 1967-NMSC-056, 77 N.M. 543, 425 P.2d 308.\n\nOpinions may be overruled by supreme court.— Opinions of the attorney general are entitled to great weight, however, to the extent they conflict with the conclusions announced by the supreme court, they must be overruled.Hanagan v. Board of County Comm'rs, 1958-NMSC-053, 64 N.M. 103, 325 P.2d 282.\n\nConflict over interpretation subject to declaratory judgment.— Where there was an administrative stalemate, detrimental to public interest, in which attorney general claimed that entire chapter on liquor sales was unconstitutional, contrary to assertion of director of department of alcoholic beverage control, and attorney general construed a separate chapter on liquor sales to allow sale of alcoholic beverages by the drink on Sundays, but director denied such an interpretation, there existed an actual controversy between interested parties rendering suit proper for declaratory judgment relief even though a licensed dispenser of alcoholic beverages was not a party.State ex rel. Maloney v. Sierra, 1970-NMSC-144, 82 N.M. 125, 477 P.2d 301.\n\nAttorney general is legal representative of state agencies, departments, etc.— While a district attorney is to advise state officers within his district when requested, this means \"advise these officers on matters relating to the judicial district in which he is located.\" This position is made firm when we remember that the attorney general is the legal representative of all state agencies, departments, etc. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-61.\n\nMagistrates.— As a magistrate is a state officer, he is entitled to be represented by the attorney general's office when he is sued as a result of action taken by him in his official capacity. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-83.\n\nFormal and informal.— The attorney general is authorized to render formal and official opinions only to those officials stated in this section. However, an informal and unofficial expression of view may be given to nonenumerated officials. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-59.\n\nNew Mexico Attorney General's office issues opinions on questions of law.— The Attorney General's Office issues opinions on questions of law, is not an adjudicative body, and does not resolve factual disputes that may be resolved by a court. 2024 Op. Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. No. 2024-02.\n\nOpinion on qualification of legislator unauthorized.— This section and N.M. Const., art. III, § 1 (separation of powers provision) bar the attorney general from giving an opinion of the issue of whether or not a public school teacher is prohibited from becoming a state legislator. Only the legislature itself can decide the qualifications of its members. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-21.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Resolving Land-use Disputes by Intimidation: SLAPPSuits in New Mexico,\" see 32 N.M.L. Rev. 217 (2002).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —7 Am. Jur. 2d Attorney General §§ 9 to 13.\n\nRight of attorney general to intervene in divorce suit, 22 A.L.R. 1112.\n\nDismissal of criminal proceedings on motion to attorney general, 66 A.L.R. 1378.\n\nPower of attorney general to compromise, settle or dismiss suit or proceeding, 81 A.L.R. 124.\n\nQuo warranto, concurrent or conflicting powers of prosecuting attorney and attorney general as to bringing action of, 131 A.L.R. 1212.\n\nRight of attorney general to represent or serve administrative officer or body to exclusion of attorney employed by such officer or body, 137 A.L.R. 818.\n\nWill contest: right of attorney general to intervene in will contest case involving charitable trust, 74 A.L.R.2d 1066.\n\nDuty of trustees of charitable trust to furnish information and records to attorney general relating to trust administration, 86 A.L.R.2d 1375.\n\nConsumer protection: right of public official to seek restitution of fruits of consumer fraud, without specific statutory authorization, 55 A.L.R.3d 198.\n\n7A C.J.S. Attorney General § 7.",

Provided, that the attorney general shall, upon direction of the governor, investigate any matter or matters in any county of the state in which the county, state or any department may be interested. After such investigation, the attorney general be, and he is hereby authorized to take such action as, in his opinion, conditions warrant. The cost of such investigation shall be paid out of the general fund of the county wherein such investigation shall have been made, and the costs of any prosecution arising out of such investigation shall be paid as are the costs in cases prosecuted by district attorneys.\n\nHistory:Laws 1933, ch. 21, § 3; 1941 Comp., § 3-303; 1953 Comp., § 4-3-3.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nGovernor as defendant to constitutional challenge.— The governor, as represented by the attorney general, because of his ability to influence the prosecution of violators, is the proper defendant in an action alleging that the statute prohibiting dissemination of \"harmful\" material to a minor over a computer network is facially invalid on First Amendment grounds.American Civil Liberties Union v. Johnson, 4 F. Supp. 2d 1024 (D.N.M. 1998), aff'd, 194 F.3d 1149 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\nNo right to displace generally.— There is nothing in the laws making the attorney general the superior of the district attorneys. Otherwise, the provision granting the attorney general a right to displace a district attorney only \"upon the failure or refusal of any district attorney to act\" would be clearly surplusage and unnecessary.State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Reese, 1967-NMSC-172, 78 N.M. 241, 430 P.2d 399.\n\nPowers when district attorney delegates prosecution.— This section and 8-5-2 NMSA 1978 permit the attorney general to bring an action on behalf of the state if no other provision has been made for it to be brought, or to step into litigation brought by another where the interests of the state are not being adequately represented or protected. Where a district attorney delegates a prosecution to the attorney general, the attorney general may proceed under the authority of this section.State v.

The attorney general may appoint a deputy attorney general and as many other assistant attorneys general together with stenographic, clerical and other necessary employees on a full- or part-time basis, at salaries to be fixed by him within budget allowances and appropriation limits, as the business of the department shall require and who shall hold office at the pleasure of the attorney general. The deputy attorney general and the assistant attorneys general shall, subject to the direction of the attorney general, have the same power and authority as the attorney general.\n\nB. Within legislative appropriations, the attorney general may appoint full-time salaried members of his staff as peace officers for the full-time investigation of violations of, and, and the full-time enforcement of, the criminal laws of the state. These employees shall comply with the certification provisions of Section 29-7-8 NMSA 1978 [repealed].\n\nHistory:Laws 1933, ch. 21, § 5; 1941 Comp., § 3-305; 1953 Comp., § 4-3-5; Laws 1955, ch. 119, § 1; 1965, ch. 214, § 1; 1979, ch. 356, § 1; 1988, ch. 92, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and it is not a part of the law.

Naranjo, 1980-NMSC-061, 94 N.M. 407, 611 P.2d 1101.\n\nFormal swearing-in ceremony not required.— Assistant attorneys general appointed pursuant to this section are not required to undergo the same formal swearing-in ceremony as the attorney general or other public official.State v. Koehler, 1981-NMSC-060, 96 N.M. 293, 629 P.2d 1222.\n\nThe Personnel Act applies to all state employees, including employees of the office of the attorney general, unless specifically excluded.— Where, in 2015, the newly elected New Mexico attorney general, before taking office, terminated certain employees within the office of the attorney general (OAG), and where the employees appealed to the state personnel board (board) claiming that 10-9-4 NMSA 1978 made all employees of the OAG classified employees who could not be discharged without the procedural protections of the Personnel Act, 10-9-1 to -25 NMSA 1978, and where the attorney general claimed that all employees of the OAG are exempt because they all serve at the pleasure of the attorney general pursuant to 8-5-5 NMSA 1978, the board erred in concluding that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the employees' appeal on the ground that the employees were not entitled to the protections of the Personnel Act, because the Personnel Act, as a comprehensive revision of the law on the subject of state public employment, supersedes 8-5-5 NMSA 1978, and the plain language of this section specifically provides that the Personnel Act applies to \"all state positions\" except those falling within specific categories.Landau v. N.M. Att'y Gen., 2019-NMCA-041, cert. denied.\n\nAssistant attorney general's salary set by attorney general.— As assistant attorney general is a state officer not subject to the salary classification of the Personnel Act. Further, the legislature has delegated to the attorney general of the state of New Mexico the exclusive right to set the salaries of his assistants. Such power is subject only to the budget allowances and appropriation limits. Thus, it is apparent if the attorney general has the funds available for the payment of his assistants, he may pay them individually such salaries as in his opinion shall be warranted. 1958. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-29.\n\nThis section clearly indicates that the attorney general of New Mexico shall fix the salaries of his assistants subject only to budget allowances and appropriation limits. 1958 Op.
