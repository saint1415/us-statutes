      "text": "It is the policy of the legislature that the transition from the administration of one governor to the administration of another governor be orderly and without friction and confusion. The legislature finds that the lag between the election and the inauguration of a new governor is approximately two months and consequently there is a premium on the necessity of a well-planned period of transition. The legislature further finds that for an orderly and efficient transfer of executive authority, the resources required by a governor-elect include, as a minimum, temporary office space in close proximity to the governor's office and the department of finance and administration, the equipment and supplies for such an office and the use of a limited full-time staff and clerical employees.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 4-28-1, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 116, § 1.",
