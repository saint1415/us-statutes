The New Mexico activities association and the local school board in the school district in which a charter school is located shall allow charter school students in grades seven through twelve to participate in school district extracurricular activities sanctioned by the New Mexico activities association if they meet eligibility requirements other than enrollment in a particular public school and if the charter school does not offer such activities sanctioned by the New Mexico activities association or any other association.\n\nB. A charter school student otherwise eligible to participate in an extracurricular activity shall participate in the public school in the attendance zone in which the student lives, provided, however, that the student may choose only one public school in which to participate.\n\nHistory:Laws 2005, ch. 97, § 1.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2005, ch. 97 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 23, was effective June 17, 2005, 90 days after adjournment of the legislature.\n\nCharter school students participating in extracurricular activities.— Legislative history and rules of construction that require all statutes to be construed in harmony with all other statutes if such harmonious construction can be accomplished, suggest an intent on the part of the legislature that 22-8-23.6 NMSA 1978 and 22-8C-8 NMSA 1978, both authorize charter school students to participate in extracurricular activities in either the public school in their attendance zone or at another public school within the school district in which their charter school is located.
