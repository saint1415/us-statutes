The legislature finds that, although New Mexico has been in the forefront of educational reforms in many areas, additional improvements are necessary to enhance and upgrade the delivery of quality education in New Mexico.\n\nB. The legislature further finds that enhancement of the educational system in New Mexico requires a renewed emphasis on the primary grades, recognizing especially the importance of the first grade to a child's future educational career.\n\nC. The legislature further finds that teachers and administrators play a key role in any reform efforts and acknowledges their importance in the educational process.\n\nD. The legislature further finds that the smorgasbord curriculum offered in many schools fails to provide students with the basic educational background necessary to provide them with indispensable life skills.\n\nE. The legislature further finds that discipline in the schools is essential to provide an atmosphere conducive to effective learning.\n\nF. It is the purpose of this reform legislation, among other things, to stress the importance of substantive academic subjects, provide for a greater emphasis on the primary grades, upgrade curriculum and graduation requirements, systematically evaluate instructional improvement and student progress, increase parental involvement in the public schools and recognize that teachers should be treated like other professionals.\n\nHistory:Laws 1986, ch. 33, § 1.",

      "text": "A. The legislature finds that no education system can be sufficient for the education of all children unless it is founded on the sound principle that every child can learn and succeed and that the system must meet the needs of all children by recognizing that student success for every child is the fundamental goal.\n\nB. The legislature finds further that the key to student success in New Mexico is to have a multicultural education system that:\n\n(1) attracts and retains quality and diverse teachers to teach New Mexico's multicultural student population;\n\n(2) holds teachers, students, schools, school districts and the state accountable;\n\n(3) integrates the cultural strengths of its diverse student population into the curriculum with high expectations for all students;\n\n(4) recognizes that cultural diversity in the state presents special challenges for policymakers, administrators, teachers and students;\n\n(5) provides students with a rigorous and relevant high school curriculum that prepares them to succeed in college and the workplace; and\n\n(6) elevates the importance of public education in the state by clarifying the governance structure at different levels.\n\nC. The legislature finds further that the teacher shortage in this country has affected the ability of New Mexico to compete for the best teachers and that, unless the state and school districts find ways to mentor beginning teachers, intervene with teachers while they still show promise, improve the job satisfaction of quality teachers and elevate the teaching profession by shifting to a professional educator licensing and salary system, public schools will be unable to recruit and retain the highest quality teachers in the teaching profession in New Mexico.\n\nD. The legislature finds further that a well-designed, well-implemented and well-maintained assessment and accountability system is the linchpin of public school reform and must ensure that:\n\n(1) students who do not meet or exceed expectations will be given individual attention and assistance through extended learning programs and individualized tutoring;\n\n(2) students have accurate, useful information about their options and the adequacy of their preparation for post-secondary education, training or employment in order to set and achieve high goals;\n\n(3) teachers who do not meet performance standards must improve their skills or they will not continue to be employed as teachers;\n\n(4) public schools make progress toward educational excellence; and\n\n(5) school districts and the state are prepared to actively intervene and improve failing public schools.\n\nE. The legislature finds further that improving children's reading and writing abilities and literacy throughout their years in school must remain a priority of the state.\n\nF. The legislature finds further that the public school governance structure needs to change to provide accountability from the bottom up instead of from the top down. Each school principal, with the help of school councils made up of parents and teachers, must be the instructional leader in the public school, motivating and holding accountable both teachers and students. Each local superintendent must function as the school district's chief executive officer and have responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the school district, including personnel and student disciplinary decisions.\n\nG. It is the purpose of the 2003 public school reform legislation as augmented by this 2007 legislation to provide the framework to implement the legislative findings to ensure student success in New Mexico.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 22-1-1.2, enacted by Laws 2003, ch. 153, § 2; 2007, ch. 307, § 1; 2007, ch. 308, § 1; 2015, ch. 58, § 1.\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective June 19, 2015, removed references to adequate yearly progress; and in Subsection D, Paragraph (4), after \"make\", deleted \"adequately yearly\".\n\nThe 2007 amendment,added Paragraph (5) of Subsection B and Paragraph (2) of Subsection D. Laws 2007, ch. 307, § 1 enacted identical amendments to this section.",
