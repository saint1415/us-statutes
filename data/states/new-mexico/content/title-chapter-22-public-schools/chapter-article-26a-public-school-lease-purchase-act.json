The lien on school improvements does not take first priority over all other liens on the real property.Liens on Charter School Improvements(1/22/16), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2016-01.\n\nConstitutionality.— The prohibition, that \"no appropriation shall be made for charitable, educational or other benevolent purposes to any person, corporation, association, institution or community, not under the absolute control of the state . . .,\" N.M. Const., Art. IV, § 31, does not apply to lease purchase agreements under this section, because the legislature does not make appropriations directly to charter schools and school districts. Moreover, this section does not violate the anti-donation clause, N.M. Const., Art. IX, § 14, because consideration can be found in the fact that the school will have the benefit and value of the use of any improvements for the life of the lease-purchase arrangement.Liens on Charter School Improvements(1/22/16), Att'y Gen.
