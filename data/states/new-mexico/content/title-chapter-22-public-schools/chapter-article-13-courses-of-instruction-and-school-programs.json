Its failure to insure compliance by the local school districts, however, implicates it under § 504 insofar as the state's status as the recipient of federal financial assistance obligates it not to permit, directly or indirectly, programs benefiting from federal financial assistance received by the state, to discriminate against handicapped persons within the context of the regulations promulgated under § 504.N.M.

A qualified student for whom the state is required by federal law to provide a free appropriate public education and who is attending a private, nonsectarian, nonprofit educational training center or a residential treatment center is a public school student and shall be counted in the special education membership of the school district that is responsible for the costs of educating the student as provided in the individualized education program for the student.\n\nL. The department shall adopt the format to report individual student data and costs for any qualified student or school-age person attending public or private educational training centers or residential treatment centers and shall include those reports in the student teacher accountability reporting system by using the same student identification number issued to a public school student pursuant to Section 22-2C-11 NMSA 1978 or by assigning a unique student identifier for school-age persons, including those who are not residents of this state but who are attending a private, nonsectarian, nonprofit educational training center or residential treatment center in this state.

Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit a school that establishes a breakfast after the bell program under the provisions of Subsection A or B of this section from beginning breakfast service before the start of the instructional day; provided that the school also serves breakfast after the beginning of the instructional day in the location of its choice, including the cafeteria, classroom, on the bus, or by providing a hand-carried breakfast.\n\nD.
