The number of students from each public school in each category shall be divided by the public school's total enrollment to determine the percentage of students in each category. The family income index for each public school is as follows:\n\n(1) for fiscal year 2022, the sum of the percentages of the public school's students in the extremely low and very low income categories during the preceding fiscal year;\n\n(2) for fiscal year 2023, the average of the sum of the percentages of the public school's students in the extremely low and very low income categories during the immediately preceding two fiscal years; and\n\n(3) for fiscal year 2024 and each subsequent fiscal year, the average of the sum of the percentages of the public school's students in the extremely low and very low income categories during the immediately preceding three fiscal years.\n\nE.

To determine the proportional share of funding that the department distributes to a school district for each eligible public school, the number of eligible students in each eligible public school shall be divided by the total number of eligible students at all eligible public schools. Each eligible public school's proportional share shall be multiplied by the total amount appropriated for distribution pursuant to the Family Income Index Act.\n\nE. The legislature may establish a different percentage of public schools to be considered pursuant to Paragraphs (1) and (2) of Subsection A of this section.\n\nF.
