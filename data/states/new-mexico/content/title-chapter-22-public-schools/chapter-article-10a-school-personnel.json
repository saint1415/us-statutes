The department of public safety shall conduct a check of state records and forward the fingerprints to the federal bureau of investigation for a national criminal history record check to determine the existence and content of a record of convictions in this state or other law enforcement jurisdictions and to generate a criminal history record check in accordance with rules of the department of public safety and regulations of the federal bureau of investigation. The department of public safety shall review the information obtained from the criminal history record check and shall compile and provide that information to the department. The department shall use the information resulting from the fingerprint-based criminal history record check to inform department decisions relating to the issuance or continuation of licensure. The applicant for initial licensure shall pay for the cost of obtaining the criminal history record check.\n\nC. Governing authorities shall develop policies and procedures to require criminal history record checks on an applicant who has been offered employment or who applies to be a school volunteer or works for the public school as a contractor or a contractor's employee and who may have unsupervised contact with children or students on school premises. Nothing in this section shall preclude governing authorities from developing and implementing policies or procedures requiring or affecting other or additional background or criminal history record checks of personnel or applicants for employment.\n\nD.

The public school shall pay for the criminal history record check for an applicant who has been offered employment. A school volunteer, contractor or contractor's employee may be required to pay for the cost of obtaining a criminal history record check.\n\nE. Convictions of felonies or misdemeanors contained in the criminal history record check shall be used in accordance with the Criminal Offender Employment Act [Chapter 28, Article 2 NMSA 1978]; provided that other information contained in the criminal history record check, if supported by independent evidence, may form the basis for the employment decisions for just cause. The department shall not exclude an otherwise qualified person from licensure on the sole basis that the person has been previously arrested or convicted of a crime, unless that person has a disqualifying criminal conviction, pursuant to Section 61-1-36 NMSA 1978.\n\nF. Records and related information shall be privileged and shall not be disclosed to a person not directly involved in the employment, volunteering or contracting decision affecting the specific applicant, school volunteer, contractor or contractor's employee who has been offered employment, a school volunteer position or a contract and will have unsupervised contact with children or students on school premises.

The superintendent or the designated representative shall investigate all allegations of ethical misconduct about any school district personnel, school employee, school volunteer, contractor or contractor's employee who resigns, is being discharged or terminated or otherwise leaves employment after an allegation has been made. If the investigation results in a finding of ethical misconduct by a licensed school employee, the superintendent or the superintendent's designated representative shall report the identity of the licensed school employee and attendant circumstances of the ethical misconduct on a standardized form to the department and the licensed school employee within thirty days following the separation from employment or immediately if the finding of ethical misconduct is sexual misconduct with an adult or child. The superintendent or the superintendent's designated representative shall also report allegations of sexual assault or sexual abuse involving any school district personnel, school employee, school volunteer, contractor or a contractor's employee to the appropriate law enforcement agency. No agreement between a departing school employee and the governing authority or superintendent shall diminish or eliminate the responsibility of investigating and reporting the alleged ethical misconduct to the department or, if legally mandated, to law enforcement, and any such agreement to the contrary is void.\n\nI. Unless the department has commenced its own investigation of a licensed school employee prior to receipt of the form, the department shall serve the licensed school employee with a notice of investigation and a notice of contemplated action pursuant to the Uniform Licensing Act [Chapter 61, Article 1 NMSA 1978] within sixty days of receipt of the form.\n\nJ.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that failure of a superintendent to serve a written notice of reemployment or termination shall automatically extend a licensed school employee's employment contract for a period in excess of one school year.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 77-8-9, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 16, § 114; 1975, ch. 306, § 8; 1986, ch. 33, § 20; 1978 Comp., § 22-10-12, recompiled as § 22-10A-22 by Laws 2003, ch. 153, § 72; 2019, ch. 238, § 5.\n\nRecompilations.— Laws 2003, ch. 153, § 72 recompiled former 22-10-12 NMSA 1978, as 22-10A-22 NMSA 1978, effective April 4, 2003.\n\nCross references.— For grounds and procedure for refusal of reemployment of certified school instructors with tenure rights,see22-10A-24 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor applicability of provisions of section,see22-10A-26 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective June 14, 2019, changed certain requirements for notice of reemployment or termination, and clarified certain terms and provisions related to notice of reemployment or termination; in the section heading, added \"Licensed school employees\"; and after \"On or before\", added \"fifteen working days prior to\".\n\nFailure to serve required notice upon nontenured teacher.— Because appeal to the state board was available only to tenured teachers for a local board's failure to serve the required notice, the failure of the local board to give a nontenured teacher the written notice required by the regulation 14 days before the end of the school year did not require that the court order her re-employment for an additional year.Provoda v. Maxwell, 1991-NMSC-022, 111 N.M. 578, 808 P.2d 28.\n\nFailure to comply with regulation requiring notice.— A regulation of the state board of education requiring that notice of reemployment or termination be served no later than 14 days before the end of the school year did not give a nontenured teacher an enforceable right to notice before the end of the school year, and therefore the board's notice of intent not to employ, timely served in accordance with this section, complied with the law.Giangreco v. Murlless, 1997-NMCA-061, 123 N.M. 498, 943 P.2d 532.\n\nReemployment offer to come from school board.— An official offer to reemploy can come only from the school board; thus, a teacher's purported acceptance of employment based on a memorandum from his supervisors of their intent to recommend his reemployment did not form an employment contract.Giangreco v.

after \"superintendent or\", added \"state agency\" throughout; in Subsection A, after \"state agency may terminate\", deleted \"an employee with fewer than three years of consecutive service\" and added \"a licensed school employee, excluding licensed educational assistants who have not been offered and accepted the third consecutive contract\", added \"A local school board or governing authority of a state agency may terminate a nonlicensed school employee or a licensed educational assistant with less than one year of employment for any reason it deems sufficient\"; in Subsection B, after \"terminating a\", deleted \"noncertified\" and added \"nonlicensed\", after \"school employee\", added \"or a licensed educational assistant\", and after \"serve the employee\", added \"or assistant\"; in Subsection C, deleted \"An\" and added \"A licensed school\", after \"district or state agency for\", deleted \"three\" and added \"more than two\", after \"consecutive years\", added \"or a nonlicensed school employee or licensed educational assistant who has been employed for more than one year\", after \"Section\", deleted \"22-10-12\" and added \"22-10A-22\", after \"superintendent or\", added \"state agency\", after \"served upon\", deleted \"him\" and added \"the employee or assistant\", after each occurrence of \"employee\", added \"or assistant\"; in Subsection D, after \"may not terminate\", deleted \"an employee who has been employed by a school district or state agency for three consecutive years\" and added \"a licensed school employee who has been offered and accepted a third-year contract or a nonlicensed school employee or licensed educational assistant who has been employed by a school district or state agency for more than one year\"; and in Subsection F, after \"accompanied by a person of\", deleted \"his\" and added \"the employee's and the local superintendent's or state agency administrator's\".\n\nThe 1994 amendment,effective May 18, 1994, substituted \"employee\" for \"certified school instructor\" throughout the section, rewrote the first sentence of Subsection A, added Subsection B and redesignated former Subsections B through E as Subsections C through F and made related changes, substituted \"or this section\" for \"or Subsection A of this section\" in Subsection C, and substituted \"terminate\" for \"refuse to reemploy\" in Subsection D.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective July 1, 1993, substituted \"Subsection A\" for \"Subsection B\" in the first sentence and \"were received\" for \"was received\" in the third sentence of Subsection B; substituted \"Subsection B\" for \"Subsection C\" in two places in the first sentence of Subsection D and in the fourth sentence of Subsection E; and substituted \"Subsection D\" for \"Subsection E\" in the fifth sentence of Subsection E.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, rewrote this section to the extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nThe 1990 amendment,effective May 16, 1990, inserted \"governing authority of a state agency\" in the catchline and in the first sentence of Subsection A and \"or governing authority\" following \"local school board\", \"or state agency\" following \"school district\", and \"local\" before \"superintendent\" throughout the section; added the final four sentences in Subsection A; in Subsection B, substituted \"five working days\" for \"five calendar days\" in two places and deleted \"local school board's\" preceding \"action to terminate him\" at the end of the second sentence; in Subsection C, inserted \"state agency\" in Subparagraph (c) of Paragraph (2); substituted \"ten working days\" for \"five calendar days\" in the third sentence of Subsection D; and, in Subsection E, substituted \"in no less than five or more than fifteen working days\" for \"within ten calendar days\" in the first sentence and \"five working days\" for \"five calendar days\" in the final sentence.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nEffect of 1994 amendment.— The 1994 amendment to this section and Section 22-10-14.1 NMSA 1978 (now Section 22-10A-25 NMSA 1978) does not protect a non-certified public school employee who was terminated a few days after the effective date of the amendment when the termination was authorized by the terms of a contract that predated the effective date of the amendment.Gadsden Fed'n of Teachers v. Board of Educ., 1996-NMCA-069, 122 N.M. 98, 920 P.2d 1052.\n\nII. TENURE RIGHTS.\n\nA. GENERALLY.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Most of the cases cited in the notes below were decided under this section as it existed prior to the 1986 reenactment. Prior to the reenactment, the section provided for tenure rights for certified school instructors employed for three consecutive school years and having entered into an employment contract for a fourth consecutive school year.See now22-10-11E NMSA 1978 [now 22-10A-21 NMSA 1978], which provides that, except as provided in 22-10-12 NMSA 1978 [now 22-10A-22 NMSA 1978], no person employed by contract pursuant to 22-10-11 NMSA 1978 [now 22-10A-21 NMSA 1978] shall have a legitimate objective expectancy of reemployment, and Subsection F of this section.\n\nDrawing on facts predating statute not retroactive application.— The supreme court has held that teacher tenure laws are prospective in application. However, a statute is not applied retroactively merely because it draws upon antecedent facts for its operation.Lucero v. Board of Regents, 1978-NMSC-054, 91 N.M. 770, 581 P.2d 458.\n\nPersons to whom applicable.— Only certified school instructors with three or more years of service are entitled to procedural due process prior to nonrenewal; the statutory scheme does not give similar protection to administrators at the expiration and nonrenewal of their contracts.Cole v. Ruidoso Mun. Sch., 947 F.2d 903 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\nTenure rights of administrators.— While certified school instructors have procedural due process and certain other rights under the School Personnel Act, administrators have no tenure rights and therefore have no expectation of continued employment.Swinney v. Deming Bd. of Educ., 1994-NMSC-039, 117 N.M. 492, 873 P.2d 238.\n\nThe legislature purposely excluded school administrators from the protections afforded certified school instructors.Naranjo v. Board of Educ. of Espa ola Pub. Schs., 1995-NMSC-015, 119 N.M. 401, 891 P.2d 542.\n\nTeacher at state school held entitled to tenure.— Where a certified teacher seeking recognition as a tenured teacher had been employed for three consecutive years prior to the effective date of the 1975 amendment making this section applicable to state agencies, and had entered into a contract for the fourth consecutive year after the amendment became effective, his years of service prior to that date could be counted towards the required number of years of employment, since a contract had been entered into after the effective date of the amendment.Lucero v. Board of Regents, 1978-NMSC-054, 91 N.M. 770, 581 P.2d 458.\n\nSection required only that a certified school instructor be employed by a school district;it did not limit that employment to teaching positions or to employment in a single school within that district.Penasco Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 4 v. Lucero, 1974-NMCA-099, 86 N.M. 683, 526 P.2d 825.\n\nInstructor lost tenure rights upon employment as administrator.— A certified school instructor who had previously acquired tenure rights as a certified school instructor with a public school district lost those tenure rights as a result of being reemployed for the next consecutive school year as a certified school administrator.Atencio v. Board of Educ., 1982-NMSC-140, 99 N.M. 168, 655 P.2d 1012 (decided prior to 1983 amendment adding last sentence of Subsection B), superseded by statute.Naranjo v. Board of Educ. of Espa ola Pub. Schs., 1995-NMSC-015, 119 N.M. 401, 891 P.2d 542.\n\nAn individual who voluntarily changed his teacher status to become a certified school administrator did not retain a property interest as a tenured certified school instructor entitled to protection by due process.Atencio v. Board of Educ., 1982-NMSC-140, 99 N.M. 168, 655 P.2d 1012 (decided prior to 1983 amendment), superseded by statute.Naranjo v. Board of Educ. of Espa ola Pub. Schs., 1995-NMSC-015, 119 N.M. 401, 891 P.2d 542.\n\nReduction in force or staff realignment.— A tenured teacher subject to termination under a reduction-in-force plan is entitled to bump a non-tenured teacher holding a position for which both are certified, or take priority over a non-tenured teacher in obtaining the necessary certification for a vacant position for which neither is presently certified. However, a tenured teacher can be terminated and a non-tenured teacher retained as an alternative to a staff realignment which would seriously affect the educational program.N.M. State Bd. of Educ. v. Abeyta, 1988-NMSC-017, 107 N.M. 1, 751 P.2d 685.\n\nReemployment offer to come from school board.— An official offer to reemploy can come only from the school board; thus, a teacher's purported acceptance of employment based on a memorandum from his supervisors of their intent to recommend his reemployment did not form an employment contract.Giangreco v. Murlless, 1997-NMCA-061, 123 N.M. 498, 943 P.2d 532.\n\nB. PROCEDURE FOR REFUSAL TO REEMPLOY.\n\nService of notice of termination during third year of employment.— A certified teacher who is served during, but prior to the completion of, the teacher's third year of teaching with notice of the school board's intent not to renew the teacher's contract may be terminated only after a hearing and based upon good cause.Weiss v. Board of Educ. of Santa Fe Pub. Sch., 2014-NMCA-100, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-009.\n\nWhere plaintiff, who was a certified teacher, received notice that the school board would not renew plaintiff's teaching contract for a fourth year; the notice was given to plaintiff two weeks before plaintiff had completed plaintiff's third consecutive year of teaching; and the school board denied plaintiff's request for a hearing, the school board could terminate plaintiff only after a hearing and based upon good cause.Weiss v. Board of Educ. of Santa Fe Pub. Sch., 2014-NMCA-100, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-009.\n\nSufficiency of notice of termination.— Where teacher with tenure rights was only given two days notice - excluding the date of service - before the end of the school year, and under the regulations prescribed by the state board she was entitled to no less than 14 days notice before the end of the school year, the conduct of the local board in failing to follow the regulation amounted to unfairness, and although teacher may have known her principal was going to recommend to the local board that she not be reemployed, this placed no burden upon her to employ an attorney, or to otherwise begin the preparation of her defense, in anticipation of the ruling of the local board. She was entitled, insofar as the section and the rule permitted, to a timely notice, pursuant to the requirements of the rule.Brininstool v. N.M. State Bd. of Educ., 1970-NMCA-034, 81 N.M. 319, 466 P.2d 885.\n\nFormality of notice of termination.— Evaluation reports by a school principal and a supervisor addressed \"To Whom It May Concern,\" copies of which were sent to counsel for teacher, did not constitute the written statement of the cause or causes for his dismissal even though the letter by which these evaluation reports were transmitted referred to them as formal charges on file with the local board, and also advised of complaints and observations made against teacher by school patrons and parents.Belen Mun. Bd. of Educ. v. Sanchez, 1965-NMSC-088, 75 N.M. 386, 405 P.2d 229.\n\nGrounds for termination.— Absent grounds personal to a teacher, to terminate his services it is necessary to show affirmatively that there is no position available which he is qualified to teach, and where a local board asserts no grounds personal to the teacher, it is up to them to prove that no position is available for which he is qualified.Penasco Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 4 v. Lucero, 1974-NMCA-099, 86 N.M. 683, 526 P.2d 825;Fort Sumner Mun. Sch. Bd. v. Parsons, 1971-NMCA-066, 82 N.M. 610, 485 P.2d 366, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 601, 485 P.2d 357.\n\nC. HEARINGS.\n\nDue process required.— Exhaustion of administrative remedies as a precursor to plaintiff's suit for wrongful termination was not required where school district did not inform plaintiff of his right to attend the board meeting where his termination would be discussed, and thereby deprived plaintiff of his due process right to employ the administrative process mandated by this section.Franco v. Carlsbad Mun. Schs., 2001-NMCA-042, 130 N.M. 543, 28 P.3d 531.\n\nHearing prerequisite to appeal.— It is well settled that a teacher must first seek a hearing before the local board and, if dissatisfied there, appeal from an adverse decision of the local board to the state board of education.Shepard v. Board of Educ., 1970-NMSC-067, 81 N.M. 585, 470 P.2d 306; (decided under former Section 22-10-19 NMSA 1978, repealed in 1986).\n\nThe right to appeal to the state board, affirmatively authorized, is from a decision of the local board \"after a hearing.\" The negative implication is that where no hearing has been held, an appeal to the state board is not authorized. Absent a hearing before the local board, neither the state board nor the court of appeals has jurisdiction over any matter presented.Quintana v. State Bd. of Educ., 1970-NMCA-074, 81 N.M. 671, 472 P.2d 385, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 668, 472 P.2d 382 (decided under former Section 22-10-19 NMSA 1978, repealed in 1986).\n\nA teacher whose contract was not renewed and who so desired had an obligation to call for a hearing before the local school board, to be followed by an appeal to state board of education in event decision of the local board was unsatisfactory, before resorting to the courts for relief.Jones v. Board of Sch. Dirs., 1951-NMSC-025, 55 N.M. 195, 230 P.2d 231 (decided under former Section 22-10-19 NMSA 1978, repealed in 1986).\n\nLocal board's decision must rest on its conclusion of lawand the conclusion must in turn be supported by one or more findings of fact.Morgan v. N.M. State Bd. of Educ., 1971-NMCA-102, 83 N.M. 106, 488 P.2d 1210, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 105, 488 P.2d 1209 (decided under former Section 22-10-19 NMSA 1978, repealed in 1986).\n\nAdmission of hearsay evidence.— Where discharged school principal, appealing from his discharge for insubordination, complained of the admission of four written exhibits at the local board hearing on the basis that the documents were hearsay and prejudicial to his interest, and where none of the four exhibits contained evidence of insubordination during the term of the current contract, but each tended to establish that principal's insubordination during the current contract was willful, admission of the written hearsay was not error, since it could not have said that principal's right to a fair hearing, or his interests, was substantially prejudiced thereby.McAlister v. N.M. State Bd. of Educ., 1971-NMCA-088, 82 N.M. 731, 487 P.2d 159 (decided under former Section 22-10-19 NMSA 1978, repealed in 1986).\n\nConstitutionality.— The procedures in this section, 22-10-14.1 (now 22-10A-25 NMSA 1978), 22-10-17 (now 22-10A-27 NMSA 1978), and 22-10-17.1 NMSA 1978 (now 22-10A-28 NMSA 1978) satisfy the requirements of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-05.\n\n\"Employed\"required that a contract be entered into for four consecutive years and services be rendered. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-70.\n\nTeacher did not acquire tenurewhere the three years of service were not consecutive, being interrupted by a leave of absence for one year. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-70.\n\nPolicy behind tenure statute.— The legislature recognized the sound public policy of retaining in the public school system teachers who had become increasingly valuable by reason of their experience and had by statute assured these public servants an indefinite tenure of position during satisfactory performance of their duties. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-152.\n\nLaw reviews.— For 1984-88 survey of New Mexico administrative law, 19 N.M.L. Rev. 575 (1990).\n\nAm.

      "text": "A. An employee who is still aggrieved by a decision of a local school board or governing authority rendered pursuant to Section 22-10A-24 NMSA 1978 may appeal the decision to an arbitrator. A written appeal shall be submitted to the local superintendent or administrator within five working days from the receipt of the local school board's or governing authority's written decision or the refusal of the board or authority to grant a hearing. The appeal shall be accompanied by a statement of particulars specifying the grounds on which it is contended that the decision was impermissible pursuant to Subsection E of Section 22-10A-24 NMSA 1978 and including a statement of facts supporting the contentions. Failure of the employee to submit a timely appeal or a statement of particulars with the appeal shall disqualify the employee for any appeal and render the local school board's or governing authority's decision final.\n\nB. The local school board or governing authority and the employee shall meet within ten working days from the receipt of the request for an appeal and select an independent arbitrator to conduct the appeal. If the parties fail to agree on an independent arbitrator, they shall request the presiding judge in the judicial district in which the employee's public school is located to select one. The presiding judge shall select the independent arbitrator within five working days from the date of the parties' request.\n\nC. A qualified independent arbitrator shall be appointed who is versed in employment practices and school procedures and who preferably has experience in the practice of law. No person shall be appointed to serve as the independent arbitrator who has any direct or indirect financial interest in the outcome of the proceeding, has any relationship to any party in the proceeding, is employed by the local school board or governing authority or is a member of or employed by any professional or labor organization of which the employee is a member.\n\nD. Appeals from the decision of the local school board or governing authority shall be decided after a de novo hearing before the independent arbitrator. The issue to be decided by the independent arbitrator is whether there was just cause for the decision of the local school board or governing authority to terminate the employee.\n\nE. The de novo hearing shall be held within thirty working days from the selection of the independent arbitrator. The arbitrator shall give written notice of the date, time and place of the hearing, and such notice shall be sent to the employee and the local school board or governing authority.\n\nF. Each party has the right to be represented by counsel at the hearing before the independent arbitrator.\n\nG. Discovery shall be limited to depositions and requests for production of documents on a time schedule to be established by the independent arbitrator.\n\nH. The independent arbitrator may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and for the production of books, records, documents and other evidence and shall have the power to administer oaths. Subpoenas so issued shall be served and enforced in the manner provided by law for the service and enforcement of subpoenas in a civil action.\n\nI. The rules of civil procedure shall not apply to the de novo hearing, but it shall be conducted so that both contentions and responses are amply and fairly presented. To this end, the independent arbitrator shall permit either party to call and examine witnesses, cross-examine witnesses and introduce exhibits. The technical rules of evidence shall not apply, but, in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, the independent arbitrator shall require reasonable substantiation of statements or records tendered, the accuracy or truth of which is in reasonable doubt.\n\nJ. The local school board or governing authority has the burden of proof and shall prove by a preponderance of the evidence that, at the time the notice of termination was served on the employee, the local school board or governing authority had just cause to terminate the employee. If the local school board or governing authority proves by a preponderance of the evidence that there was just cause for its action, then the burden shifts to the employee to rebut the evidence presented by the local school board or governing authority.\n\nK. The independent arbitrator shall uphold the local school board's or governing authority's decision only if it proves by a preponderance of the evidence that, at the time the notice of termination was served on the employee, the local school board or governing authority had just cause to terminate the employee. If the local school board or governing authority fails to meet its burden of proof or if the employee rebuts the proof offered by the local school board or governing authority, the arbitrator shall reverse the decision of the local school board or governing authority.\n\nL. Either party desiring a record of the arbitration proceedings may, at the party's own expense, record or otherwise provide for a transcript of the proceedings; provided, however, that the record so provided shall not imply any right of automatic appeal or review.\n\nM. The independent arbitrator shall render a written decision affirming or reversing the action of the local school board or governing authority. The decision shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law. The parties shall receive actual written notice of the decision of the independent arbitrator within ten working days from the conclusion of the de novo hearing.\n\nN. The sole remedies available under this section shall be reinstatement or payment of compensation reinstated in full but subject to any additional compensation allowed other employees of like qualifications and experience employed by the school district or state agency and including reimbursement for compensation during the entire period for which compensation was terminated, or both, less an offset for any compensation received by the employee during the period the compensation was terminated.\n\nO. Unless a party can demonstrate prejudice arising from a departure from the procedures established in this section and in Section 22-10A-24 NMSA 1978, such departure shall be presumed to be harmless error.\n\nP. The decision of the independent arbitrator shall be binding on both parties and shall be final and nonappealable except where the decision was procured by corruption, fraud, deception or collusion, in which case it shall be appealed to the district court in the judicial district in which the public school or state agency is located.\n\nQ. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses. The independent arbitrator's fees and other expenses incurred in the conduct of the arbitration shall be assigned at the discretion of the independent arbitrator.\n\nR. School districts shall file a record with the department of all terminations and all actions arising from terminations annually.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 22-10-14.1, enacted by Laws 1986, ch. 33, § 23; 1990, ch. 90, § 3; 1991, ch. 187, § 5; 1994, ch. 110, § 3; recompiled as § 22-10A-25 by Laws 2003, ch. 153, § 72; 2021, ch. 94, § 7.\n\nRecompilations.— Laws 2003, ch. 153, § 72 recompiled former 22-10-14.1 NMSA 1978, as 22-10A-25 NMSA 1978, effective April 4, 2003.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective June 18, 2021, amended references to a recompiled section of law, and removed provisions related to official transcripts of school personnel appeals hearings; changed each occurrence of \"22-10-14\" to \"22-10A-24\" throughout; in Subsection L, deleted \"No official record shall be made of the hearing\", and after \"shall not\", deleted \"be deemed an official transcript of the proceedings nor shall it\"; and in Subsection R, deleted \"Local\".\n\nThe 1994 amendment,effective May 18, 1994, substituted \"employee\" for \"certified school instructor\" throughout the section, substituted \"Subsection E of Section 22-10-14 NMSa 1978\" for \"Subsection D of Section 22-10-14 NMSA 1978\" in Subsection A, and substituted \"professional or labor organization\" for \"teachers' organization\" in Subsection C.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, rewrote this section to the extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nThe 1990 amendment,effective May 16, 1990, inserted \"or governing authority\" following \"local school board\" throughout the section; in Subsection A, deleted \"who has been employed by a school district for three consecutive years and\" following \"school instructor\", rewrote the second sentence which read \"A written request for an appeal shall be submitted to the local superintendent within five calendar days from the receipt of the local school board's written decision or the refusal of the board to grant a hearing\"; in Subsection B, substituted \"ten working days\" for \"ten calendar days\" in the first sentence and \"five working days\" for \"five calendar days\" in the third sentence; substituted \"thirty working days\" for \"thirty calendar days\" in Subsection E; substituted \"ten working days\" for \"ten calendar days\" in the third sentence of Subsection M; inserted \"or state agency\" following \"school district\" in two places in Subsection N and following \"public school\" near the end of Subsection P; and, in Subsection Q, substituted \"assigned at the discretion of the arbitrator\" for \"borne by the school district; provided that if the certified school instructor does not prevail in the proceeding, he shall be responsible for reimbursing the school district for the costs incurred in the conduct of the arbitration proceedings and the arbitrator's fees\" at the end thereof.\n\nEffect of 1994 amendment.— The 1994 amendment to this section and Section 22-10-14 NMSA 1978 (now Sections 22-10A-24 NMSA 1978) does not protect a non-certified public school employee who was terminated a few days after the effective date of the amendment when the termination was authorized by the terms of a contract that predated the effective date of the amendment.Gadsden Fed'n of Teachers v. Board of Educ., 1996-NMCA-069, 122 N.M. 98, 920 P.2d 1052.\n\nAdequate review necessary for reversal.— Before the state board opts to reject the decision of its hearing officer, particularly when the credibility of the witnesses is at issue, at the very least it must review so much of the transcript of the proceedings before the hearing officer as is necessary to support its decision.Board of Educ. v. New Mexico State Bd. of Educ., 1987-NMCA-084, 106 N.M. 129, 740 P.2d 123 (decided under former Section 22-10-20 NMSA 1978).\n\nArbitration not required.— Plaintiff was not required to appeal his termination by a school district to an independent arbitrator before filing suit for wrongful termination, where the district's own procedures successfully thwarted any possible effort by plaintiff to utilize available administrative procedures.Franco v. Carlsbad Mun. Schs., 2001-NMCA-042, 130 N.M. 543, 28 P.3d 531.\n\nBoard's reversal of hearing officer held erroneous.— The state board improvidently found that the local board did not establish sufficient cause for its discharge of a teacher by a preponderance of the evidence, in light of the number of witnesses testifying before the local board as to the teacher's sexual advances and the nature of their testimony.Board of Educ. v. N.M.

A superintendent may recommend to the governing authority the discharge of a licensed school employee during the term of a contract authorized pursuant to Section 22-10A-21 NMSA 1978 only for just cause according to the following procedure:\n\n(1) the superintendent shall serve a written notice of intent to recommend discharge on the licensed school employee in accordance with the law for service of process in civil actions; and\n\n(2) the superintendent shall state in the notice of intent to recommend discharge the cause for the recommendation and shall advise the licensed school employee of the licensed school employee's right to a discharge hearing before the governing authority as provided in this section. If the licensed school employee does not exercise that right to hearing, the superintendent shall discharge the licensed school employee.\n\nB. A licensed school employee who receives a notice of intent to recommend discharge pursuant to Subsection A of this section may exercise the licensed school employee's right to a hearing before the governing authority by giving the superintendent written notice of that election within ten working days of the licensed school employee's receipt of the notice of intent to recommend discharge.\n\nC. The governing authority shall hold a discharge hearing no less than twenty and no more than forty working days after the superintendent receives the written election from the licensed school employee and shall give the licensed school employee at least ten days written notice of the date, time and place of the discharge hearing.\n\nD.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nConstitutionality.— Considered together, the pre- and post-termination procedures of the School Personnel Act, Sections 22-10A-27 to -28 NMSA 1978, comport with due process requirements.West v. San Jon Bd. of Educ., 2003-NMCA-130, 134 N.M. 498, 79 P.3d 842, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-002, 134 N.M. 723, 82 P.3d 533.\n\nArbitration decision acts as collateral estoppel.— Where plaintiff was a certified teacher; defendant gave plaintiff notice of intent to discharge; plaintiff did not request a hearing before the school board; after defendant discharged plaintiff, plaintiff requested a hearing before the school board or before an arbitrator; defendant subsequently filed an action in district court for breach of contract and violation of due process; the district court ordered arbitration and stayed the proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration; plaintiff was afforded an arbitration hearing before an independent arbitrator; the parties to the arbitration and the district court hearing were the same; the issue in the arbitration and the district court was the same; in the arbitration, plaintiff had notice of the allegations against plaintiff, was represented by counsel, and presented evidence and cross-examined witnesses; and the arbitrator upheld plaintiff's discharge and concluded that the procedural errors concerning plaintiff's request for a hearing before the school board were mooted by the district court's ruling requiring arbitration, plaintiff's claim for damages in district court was determined by the arbitrator and was barred by collateral estoppel.Larsen v. Farmington Mun. Sch., 2010-NMCA-094, 148 N.M. 926, 242 P.3d 493, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-009, 149 N.M. 49, 243 P.3d 753.\n\nThe legislature can constitutionally prescribe the methods for adjudicating a disputeover termination of a certified school employee's right to continued employment because that right is a public right created by statute.Board of Educ. of Carlsbad Mun. Schs. v. Harrell, 1994-NMSC-096, 118 N.M. 470, 882 P.2d 511.\n\n\"Discharge\" includes temporary or permanent removal.— \"Discharge,\" as used in this section, prohibiting the discharge of certified instructors without an opportunity for notice and hearing, includes removing the teacher either temporarily or permanently from employment.Board of Educ. v. Singleton, 1985-NMCA-112, 103 N.M. 722, 712 P.2d 1384.\n\nReduction in force as just cause.— Statutory \"just cause\" allows for discharge of a teacher when exigent fiscal circumstances justify a reduction in force, but the teacher's competence, turpitude and performance do not.Aguilera v. Board of Educ., 2006-NMSC-015, 139 N.M. 330, 132 P.3d 587.\n\nStandard for reduction in force discharge.— When a school board is forced to reduce its teaching staff by way of a reduction in force, it must prove that there is no other position for which the teacher, who is to be discharged, is qualified consistent with the academic necessities of the district.Aguilera v. Board of Educ., 2006-NMSC-015, 139 N.M. 330, 132 P.3d 587.\n\nJustification for discharge for reduction in force.— Unlike termination, which applies to the coming year, discharge results in a teacher losing his or her job in the middle of the school year when there may be no opportunity to find other employment. Given the extreme hardship to the teacher, the justifications must be substantial to allow a school board to lay off a qualified teacher in the middle of a school year pursuant to a reduction in force. The school board has to show not just projected financial burdens in the future, but that it cannot survive financially in the present year, which is already underway.Aguilera v. Board of Educ., 2006-NMSC-015, 139 N.M. 330, 132 P.3d 587.\n\nII. DISCHARGE PROCEDURE.\n\nAdequate notice.— Where plaintiff, who was a certified teacher, was discharged; the notice of intent to recommend discharge alleged that plaintiff proposed to a student that the student pose for lewd photographs; the student at the arbitration hearing testified that plaintiff wanted the student to go with plaintiff somewhere in the woods after school to take pictures; the arbitrator found that defendant did not prove allegations that the proposed photographs were lewd; the arbitrator found only that plaintiff suggested to a student that the student pose for pictures outside the classroom and outside the presence of anyone else and that the photography was not part of a school project; and the arbitrator concluded that this suggestion alone constituted just cause for termination of plaintiff, plaintiff was not denied due process because the notice was sufficient to apprise plaintiff of the charges against plaintiff and the arbitrator's decision was not based on new charges but on information presented at the arbitration hearing which did not differ from the allegations contained in the notice.Larsen v. Bd. of Educ. of the Farmington Mun. Sch., 2010-NMCA-093, 148 N.M. 926, 242 P.3d 487, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-009, 149 N.M. 49, 243 P.3d 753.\n\nThe school board is required to conduct discharge hearings.— Where the Albuquerque public school district (APS) sought to discharge a teacher by providing the teacher a discharge hearing before the superintendent and where the school board asserted that changes made to the Public School Code in 2003 divested school boards of all authority to act on any personnel matters and vested exclusive authority to act on all personnel matters in the local school superintendent, the district court did not err in issuing a permanent writ of mandamus to APS and its superintendent, directing that a proposed discharge hearing be conducted by the APS school board, because APS had a clear, legal duty under this section to provide the teacher with a discharge hearing before the school board.Alarcon v. Albuquerque Pub. Schs. Bd. of Educ., 2018-NMCA-021, cert. denied.\n\nReduction in force.— A school board cannot discharge a certified school teacher before her current employment contract expires solely because of a reduction in force.Aguilera v. Board of Educ., 2005-NMCA-069, 137 N.M. 642, 114 P.3d 322, cert. granted, 2005-NMCERT-006, 137 N.M. 767, 115 P.3d 230.\n\nPreponderance of evidence.— It is incumbent upon a school board to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that teacher's \"discharge\" was based upon her performance, competence, or turpitude.Aguilera v. Board of Educ., 2005-NMCA-069, 137 N.M. 642, 114 P.3d 322, cert. granted, 2005-NMCERT-006, 137 N.M. 767, 115 P.3d 230.\n\nConstruction of this section and Section 22-10-21 NMSA 1978 (now Section 22-10A-30 NMSA 1978).Morgan v. New Mexico State Bd. of Educ., 1971-NMCA-102, 83 N.M. 106, 488 P.2d 1210, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 105, 488 P.2d 1209 (decided prior to 1986 reenactment).\n\nSection inapplicable to suspensions with pay for duration of contract.— School board's action in suspending school superintendent with pay for the duration of his contract period did not amount to a discharge and was not protected by the statutory requirements for a hearing.Black v. Board of Educ., 1974-NMSC-095, 87 N.M. 45, 529 P.2d 271 (decided prior to 1986 reenactment).\n\nNeutral tribunal not required at pre-termination hearing,because the statutory framework of the School Personnel Act, Sections 22-10A-27 to -28 NMSA 1978, provides for the opportunity to appeal the board's decision to an independent arbitrator in a post-termination hearing, followed by meaningful district court (now court of appeals) review.West v. San Jon Bd. of Educ., 2003-NMCA-130, 134 N.M. 498, 79 P.3d 842, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-002, 134 N.M. 723, 82 P.3d 533.\n\nExhaustion of administrative remedies required.By not completing her appeal of the board's decision to an independent arbitrator, a discharged teacher failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under the procedures set forth by the School Personnel Act, Sections 22-10A-27 to -28 NMSA 1978.West v. San Jon Bd. of Educ., 2003-NMCA-130, 134 N.M. 498, 79 P.3d 842, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-002, 134 N.M. 723, 82 P.3d 533.\n\nWhether discharged teacher was entitled to pre-discharge work conferenceswas a factual question where allegations against her were based on insubordination and willful misconduct.West v. San Jon Bd. of Educ., 2003-NMCA-130, 134 N.M. 498, 79 P.3d 842, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-002, 134 N.M. 723, 82 P.3d 533.\n\nDetermination as to good cause for discharge.— In the absence of a statutory definition of the term, it is the function of the state board of education in the exercise of its sound discretion to determine the question of \"good cause,\" and its determination is conclusive unless the evidence discloses that it acted unlawfully, arbitrarily or capriciously.Lopez v. State Bd. of Educ., 1962-NMSC-070, 70 N.M. 166, 372 P.2d 121 (decided prior to enactment of Section 22-10A-2 NMSA 1978).\n\nSchool boards may discharge superintendent without interim appointment.— The school board may discharge those employees of the school district that it directly employs, specifically superintendents, and is not required to hire an interim employee to fulfill this task or wait for the superintendent to recommend his own discharge.Stanley v. Raton Bd. of Educ., 1994-NMSC-059, 117 N.M. 717, 876 P.2d 232.\n\nAssault while intoxicated.— State board of education did not act unlawfully, arbitrarily or capriciously in finding good cause for the termination of a teacher's contract where teacher assaulted a woman in a bar while intoxicated.Lopez v. State Bd. of Educ., 1962-NMSC-070, 70 N.M. 166, 372 P.2d 121.\n\nInsubordination.— A principal's permitting a reading program which departed from the self-contained classroom basis established in the school system constituted insubordination.McAlister v. N.M. State Bd. of Educ., 1971-NMCA-088, 82 N.M. 731, 487 P.2d 159.\n\nHarmless error applies to untimely request for discharge hearing.— The explicit application of the harmless error provision in 22-10A-28(L) NMSA 1978 to this section's provision for requesting a discharge hearing unambiguously expresses the legislature's intent that failure to comply with the five-day time limit, 22-10A-27(B) NMSA 1978, is deemed harmless error, absent a showing of prejudice.National Educ. Ass'n of N.M. v. Santa Fe Pub. Sch., 2016-NMCA-009.\n\nWhere petitioner, who received notice of the Santa Fe public schools' intent to discharge him from his teaching and coaching positions, filed a request for hearing two days after the five-day time limit had passed, petitioner's departure from the five-day time requirement, 22-10A-27(B) NMSA 1978, was harmless error where respondent failed to demonstrate prejudice.National Educ. Ass'n of N.M. v. Santa Fe Pub. Sch., 2016-NMCA-009.\n\nTiming of hearing mandatory.— The time specified for conducting a dismissal hearing pursuant to this section is mandatory, unless waived by the parties or unless a continuance is sought and obtained for good cause.Board of Educ. v. Singleton, 1985-NMCA-112, 103 N.M. 722, 712 P.2d 1384.\n\nAppeal limited to issues urged at hearing.— A school board's delay in according a dismissed teacher a timely hearing under this section and the provisions of her contract could not be urged as a basis for dismissal of the board's appeal, where this ground was not initially argued in the administrative hearing below.Board of Educ. v. Singleton, 1985-NMCA-112, 103 N.M. 722, 712 P.2d 1384.\n\nConstitutionality.— The procedures in Section 22-10-14 (now Section 22-10A-24), Section 22-10-14.1 (now Section 22-10A-25), this section, and Section 22-10-17.1 NMSA 1978 (now Section 22-10A-28 NMSA 1978) satisfy the requirements of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States. 1988 Op.

A licensed school employee aggrieved by a decision of the governing authority to discharge the licensed school employee after a discharge hearing held pursuant to Section 22-10A-27 NMSA 1978 may appeal the decision to an independent arbitrator. A written notice of appeal shall be submitted to the governing authority within ten working days from the receipt of the copy of the written decision of the governing authority.\n\nB. The governing authority may delegate responsibility for the arbitration to the superintendent. The superintendent as delegate of the governing authority and the licensed school employee shall meet within ten calendar days from the receipt of the notice of appeal and select an independent arbitrator to conduct the appeal, or, in the event the parties fail to agree on an independent arbitrator, they shall request the presiding judge in the judicial district in which the public school is located to select the independent arbitrator. The presiding judge shall select the independent arbitrator within five working days from the date of the parties' request.\n\nC. A qualified independent arbitrator shall be appointed who is versed in employment practices and school procedures. No person shall be appointed to serve as the independent arbitrator who has any direct or indirect financial interest in the outcome of the proceeding, has any relationship to any party in the proceeding, is employed by the superintendent or is a member of or employed by any professional organization of which the licensed school employee is a member.\n\nD. Appeals from the decision of the governing authority shall be decided after a de novo hearing before the independent arbitrator. The superintendent, as delegate of the governing authority, shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that, at the time of the notice of intent to recommend discharge, the superintendent had just cause to discharge the licensed school employee. The superintendent shall present evidence first, with the licensed school employee presenting evidence thereafter.\n\nE. The hearing shall be held within thirty working days from the selection of the independent arbitrator. The independent arbitrator shall give written notice of the date, time and place of the hearing, and such notice shall be sent to the licensed school employee and the governing authority.\n\nF. Each party has the right to be represented by counsel at the hearing before the independent arbitrator.\n\nG. Discovery shall be limited to depositions and requests for production of documents on a time schedule to be established by the independent arbitrator.\n\nH. The independent arbitrator may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and for the production of books, records, documents and other evidence and shall have the power to administer oaths. Subpoenas so issued shall be served and enforced in the manner provided by law for the service and enforcement of subpoenas in a civil action or in the manner provided by the American arbitration association's voluntary labor arbitration rules if that entity is used by the parties.\n\nI. The rules of civil procedure shall not apply to the hearing, but it shall be conducted so that both contentions and responses are amply and fairly presented. To this end, the independent arbitrator shall permit either party to call and examine witnesses, cross-examine witnesses and introduce exhibits. The technical rules of evidence shall not apply, but, in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, the independent arbitrator may require reasonable substantiation of statements or records tendered, the accuracy or truth of which is in reasonable doubt.\n\nJ. An official record shall be made of the hearing. Either party may order a transcript of the record at the party's own expense.\n\nK. The independent arbitrator shall render a written decision affirming or reversing the action of the governing authority. The decision shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law. The parties shall receive the written decision of the independent arbitrator within thirty working days from the conclusion of the hearing.\n\nL. Unless a party can demonstrate prejudice arising from a departure from the procedures established in this section and in Section 22-10A-27 NMSA 1978, such departure shall be presumed to be harmless error.\n\nM. The decision of the independent arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties and shall be nonappealable except where the decision was procured by corruption, fraud, deception or collusion, in which case it may be appealed to the court of appeals by filing a notice of appeal as provided by the New Mexico rules of appellate procedure.\n\nN. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses. The independent arbitrator's fees and other expenses incurred in the conduct of the arbitration shall be assigned at the discretion of the independent arbitrator.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 22-10-17.1, enacted by Laws 1986, ch. 33, § 25; 1990, ch. 90, § 5; 1991, ch. 187, § 8; recompiled as § 22-10A-28 by Laws 2003, ch. 153, § 72; 2019, ch. 238, § 9.\n\nRecompilations.— Laws 2003, ch. 153, § 72 recompiled former 22-10-17.1 NMSA 1978, as 22-10A-28 NMSA 1978, effective April 4, 2003.\n\nCross references.— For New Mexico Rules of Appellate Procedure,see12-101 NMRA.\n\nFor issuance of subpoenas in civil actions,see1-045 NMRA.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective June 14, 2019, provided that the governing authority may delegate responsibility for the arbitration to the superintendent, and clarified certain terms and provisions in the section; in the section heading, added \"Discharge\" and \"licensed school employees\"; in Subsection B, after \"governing authority\", added \"may delegate responsibility for the arbitration to the superintendent. The superintendent as delegate of the governing authority\"; and in Subsection L, after \"Section\", deleted \"22-10-17\" and added \"22-10A-27\".\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, substituted \"employee\" for \"instructor or certified school administrator\" throughout the section; substituted \"notice of appeal\" for \"request for an appeal\" in the second sentence in Subsection A and in the first sentence in Subsection B; in Subsection A, substituted \"a discharge hearing held\" for \"his statement to the local school board presented\" in the first sentence and deleted the former third sentence which read \"The appeal shall be accompanied by a statement of particulars specifying the grounds on which it is contended that the decision was not based on good and just cause\"; in Subsection C substituted \"professional organization\" for \"teachers' or administrators' organization\"; in Subsection D, inserted \"de novo\" in the first sentence and substituted the second and third sentences for the former second sentence which read \"The issue to be decided by the independent arbitrator is whether the board's decision to discharge the certified school instructor or certified school administrator was based on good and just cause\"; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nThe 1990 amendment,effective May 16, 1990, inserted \"or governing authority\" following \"local school board\" throughout the section; in Subsection A, in the first sentence, inserted \"local school\" preceding \"board\" the second time the reference appears and substituted \"may appeal the decision\" for \"may request an appeal\", in the second sentence, inserted \"or administrator\" and substituted \"five working days\" for \"five calendar days\" and, in the third sentence, substituted \"The appeal shall be\" for \"The request for an appeal to an independent arbitrator shall be\"; substituted \"five working days\" for \"five calendar days\" in the final sentence of Subsection B; in Subsection E, substituted \"thirty working days\" for \"thirty calendar days\" in the first sentence and inserted \"or certified school administrator\" in the second sentence; substituted \"labor arbitration rules\" for \"rules for arbitration\" near the end of Subsection H; substituted \"thirty working days\" for \"thirty calendar days\" in the third sentence of Subsection K; in Subsection N, substituted \"Each party\" for \"Either party\" at the beginning of the first sentence and rewrote the second sentence which read \"The arbitrator's fees and other expenses incurred in the conduct of the arbitration shall be borne by the school districts; provided that if the certified school instructor or administrator does not prevail in the proceeding, he shall be responsible for reimbursing the school district for the costs incurred in the conduct of the arbitration proceeding and the arbitrator's fees\"; and deleted former Subsection O relating to compliance with the American arbitration association's rules.\n\nConsidered together, the pre- and post-termination procedures of the School Personnel Act,22-10A-27 and 22-10A-28 NMSA 1978, comport with due process requirements.West v. San Jon Bd. of Educ., 2003-NMCA-130, 134 N.M. 498, 79 P.3d 842, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-002, 134 N.M. 723, 82 P.3d 533.\n\nNeutral tribunal not required at pre-termination hearing,because the statutory framework of the School Personnel Act, 22-10A-27 and 22-10A-28 NMSA 1978, provides for the opportunity to appeal the board's decision to an independent arbitrator in a post-termination hearing, followed by meaningful district court (now court of appeals) review.West v. San Jon Bd. of Educ., 2003-NMCA-130, 134 N.M. 498, 79 P.3d 842, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-002, 134 N.M. 723, 82 P.3d 533.\n\nExhaustion of administrative remedies required.By not completing her appeal of the board's decision to an independent arbitrator, a discharged teacher failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under the procedures set forth in this section.West v. San Jon Bd. of Educ., 2003-NMCA-130, 134 N.M. 498, 79 P.3d 842, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-002, 134 N.M. 723, 82 P.3d 533.\n\nCompulsory arbitration is constitutionaland the procedures used in judicial tribunals need not be used in compulsory arbitration, so long as the arbitration procedures are sufficient to guarantee a fair proceeding. Therefore, the provisions of this section mandating compulsory arbitration of the grievances of discharged school employees do not violate an employee's right of access to the courts, or right to jury trial; nor do these provisions unconstitutionally delegate power to a nonjudicial tribunal.Board of Educ. of Carlsbad Mun. Schs. v. Harrell, 1994-NMSC-096, 118 N.M. 470, 882 P.2d 511 (1994).\n\nUnconstitutional limit on judicial review.— Because due process and the separation of powers principle requires that parties to statutorily mandated arbitration be offered meaningful review of the arbitrator's decision, the provision of Subsection M limiting judicial review of the arbitrator's decision to cases \"where the decision was procured by corruption, fraud, deception or collusion\" must be stricken as a violation of due process and as an unconstitutional delegation of judicial power.Board of Educ. of Carlsbad Mun. Schs. v. Harrell, 1994-NMSC-096, 118 N.M. 470, 882 P.2d 511.\n\nStandard of review.— Subsection D requires the reviewing entity to determine whether the alleged misconduct actually occurred and constitutes just cause for discharge.Santa Fe Pub. Schs. v. Romero, 2001-NMCA-103, 131 N.M. 383, 37 P.3d 100.\n\nHarmless error applies to untimely request for discharge hearing.— The explicit application of the harmless error provision in 22-10A-28(L) NMSA 1978 to 22-10A-27 NMSA 1978, the provision for requesting a discharge hearing, unambiguously expresses the legislature's intent that failure to comply with the five-day time limit, 22-10A-27(B), is deemed harmless error, absent a showing of prejudice.National Educ. Ass'n of N.M. v. Santa Fe Pub. Sch., 2016-NMCA-009.\n\nWhere petitioner, who received notice of the Santa Fe public schools' intent to discharge him from his teaching and coaching positions, filed a request for hearing two days after the five-day time limit had passed, petitioner's departure from the five-day time requirement, 22-10A-27(B) NMSA 1978, was harmless error where respondent failed to demonstrate prejudice.National Educ. Ass'n of N.M. v. Santa Fe Pub. Sch., 2016-NMCA-009.\n\nConstitutionality.— The procedures in Section 22-10-14 (now Section 22-10A-24 NMSA 1978), Section 22-10-14.1 (now Section 22-10A-25 NMSA 1978), Section 22-10-17 (now Section 22-10A-27 NMSA 1978), and this section satisfy the requirements of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States. 1988 Op.

If the compensation of the licensed school employee or superintendent discharged during the term of a written employment contract is to be paid monthly during a twelve-month period for services to be performed during a period less than twelve months, the licensed school employee or superintendent shall be entitled to a pro rata share of the compensation payments due for the period during the twelve months in which no services were to be performed.\n\nB. In the event the action of the governing authority in discharging a licensed school employee or superintendent is reversed on appeal, payment of compensation to the licensed school employee or superintendent shall be reinstated in full but subject to any additional compensation allowed other licensed school employees or superintendents of like qualifications and experience employed by the public school and including reimbursement for compensation during the entire period the compensation was terminated less an offset for any compensation received by the licensed school employee or superintendent from the public school during the period the compensation was terminated.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 77-8-15, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 16, § 120; 1975, ch. 306, § 13; 1978 Comp., § 22-10-18, recompiled as § 22-10A-29 by Laws 2003, ch. 153, § 72; 2019, ch. 238, § 10.\n\nRecompilations.— Laws 2003, ch. 153, § 72 recompiled former 22-10-18 NMSA 1978 as 22-10A-29 NMSA 1978, effective April 4, 2003.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective June 14, 2019, replaced each occurrence of \"school instructor\" with \"licensed school employee\", and replaced each occurrence of \"local school board\" with \"governing authority\".\n\nThe legislature can constitutionally prescribe the methods for adjudicating a disputeover termination of a certified school employee's right to continued employment because that right is a public right created by statute.Board of Educ. of Carlsbad Mun.
