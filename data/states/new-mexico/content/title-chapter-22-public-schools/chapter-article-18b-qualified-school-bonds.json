      "text": "A. The legislature finds that:\n\n(1) the condition of public school facilities has a direct effect on the safety of teachers and students and on the ability of students to learn;\n\n(2) public schools in rapidly growing urban areas of New Mexico and public schools in sparsely populated rural areas are unable to meet the capital needs for modernization of existing school facilities to meet the growing school-age population in New Mexico under present funding authorizations;\n\n(3) additional funding options are necessary to meet the needs for teacher training to improve student achievement levels and to meet the needs of the work place by providing sufficient student training in the use of advanced technology;\n\n(4) encouraging active community participation and private sector contributions to the public schools will enhance learning opportunities for New Mexico students;\n\n(5) authorizing additional forms of financing for school modernization and construction will permit eligible taxpayers to take advantage of tax credits not currently available to bondholders and will increase the market options for state and local bonds;\n\n(6) encouraging active community participation in the development of resources to build and modernize schools, to enhance educational technology and to enhance teacher training is essential to the success of students in the twenty-first century; and\n\n(7) authorizing additional alternative procedures for the sale of bonds will allow New Mexico public schools and eligible taxpayers to participate in available tax credits and to leverage additional funds for the improvement of public school facilities.\n\nB. The purpose of the Qualified School Bonds Act is to implement a state program that allows eligible taxpayers to take advantage of available tax credits by expanding the incentives to purchase and hold bonds and thereby increasing the financing alternatives for modernization and rehabilitation of public school facilities and enhancing teacher training.\n\nHistory:Laws 1999, ch. 225, § 2.",
