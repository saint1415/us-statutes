Before any general obligation bonds are issued, a local school board of a school district shall submit to a vote of the qualified electors of the school district the question of creating a debt by issuing the bonds, and a majority of those persons voting on the question shall vote for issuing the general obligation bonds.\n\nB. The election on the question of creating a debt by issuing general obligation bonds shall be held pursuant to the provisions of the Local Election Act [Chapter 1, Article 22 NMSA 1978]. The question shall be submitted to a vote at a district election upon the initiative of a local school board or upon a petition being filed with a local school board signed by qualified electors of the school district. The number of signatures required on the petition shall be at least ten percent of the number of votes cast for governor in the school district in the last preceding general election. For the purpose of determining the number of votes cast for governor in the school district at the last preceding general election, any portion of a voting division within the school district shall be construed to be wholly within the school district.

IX, § 11 violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const. by restricting the right to vote in school district bond elections to real estate owners, and likewise, this section, which implements N.M. Const., art. IX, § 11, conflicts with the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const. insofar as it restricts the franchise in school district bond elections to real estate owners or to those who have paid a property tax on property in the school district for the preceding year.Prince v.
