The Public School Insurance Authority Act (PSIA Act), 22-29-1 to 22-29-12 NMSA 1978, in contrast, identifies the insurance options available to specific types of governmental entities, including \"educational entities\" which are defined in the PSIA Act as the higher educational institutions listed in N.M. Const., Art. XII, § 11. The TCA and the PSIA Act, read in harmony, indicate that it was the intent of the legislature to authorize higher educational institutions to purchase liability insurance coverage offered by the PSIA Act.Higher Educational Facilities Authority to Purchase Liability Insurance from the New Mexico Public Insurance Authority(8/17/15), Att'y Gen.
