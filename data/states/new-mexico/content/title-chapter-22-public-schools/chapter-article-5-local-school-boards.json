Clerk v. Martinez, 2005-NMSC-037, 138 N.M. 575, 124 P.3d 210.\n\nTeaching positions.— A local school board may add or abolish teaching positions in performing its fiscal responsibilities.Aguilera v.

State Bd. of Educ., 1971-NMCA-102, 83 N.M. 106, 488 P.2d 1210, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 105, 488 P.2d 1209.\n\nNo Eleventh Amendment immunity.— School districts and their governing boards in New Mexico are not arms of the state entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.Duke v. Grady Mun. Schs., 127 F.3d 972 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\nLegislative intent.— The New Mexico legislature intended school districts or boards to be political subdivisions or local public bodies, not arms of the state.Duke v. Grady Mun. Schs., 127 F.3d 972 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\nLiability of state.— State of New Mexico is not legally liable for judgment against a school district.Duke v. Grady Mun. Schs., 127 F.3d 972 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\nAuthority of local board over personnel.— A local board is the only entity with power to terminate employees; the purpose of former Subsection D is to require input of a superintendent before a personnel decision is made, and not to render a board powerless to act except in accordance with the recommendation of its superintendent.Daddow v. Carlsbad Mun. Sch. Dist., 1995-NMSC-032, 120 N.M. 97, 898 P.2d 1235 (decided under prior law).\n\nProcurement Code exemptions applicable to school boards.— The provision of Subsection N(now Subsection J) requires school boards to contract according to all but two sections of the entire Procurement Code; this means that all bidding requirements of the Code, including the exemptions in Section 13-1-98 NMSA 1978, apply to school district contracts.Morningstar Water Users Ass'n v. Farmington Mun. Sch. Dist. No. 5, 1995-NMSC-052, 120 N.M. 307, 901 P.2d 725.\n\nUltra vires acts by school boards.— Any attempt by a local school board to enter into a contract or formulate a policy that violates the specific statutory provisions governing school boards is ultra vires and void. Thus, any attempt by a school board to enter into a contract or promulgate a termination policy through manuals which give an employee rights in conflict with the School Personnel Act is ultra vires and void.Swinney v. Deming Bd. of Educ., 1994-NMSC-039, 117 N.M. 492, 873 P.2d 238.\n\nThe local school board, as the policy maker of the public employer, is the proper party to engage in collective bargaining negotiations and to review employee grievances.— Where the central consolidated school dstrict refused to review grievances appealed to the school board pursuant to a negotiated grievance procedure contained in a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the teachers' union, and where the school board asserted that changes made to the Public School Code in 2003 divested school boards of all authority to act on any personnel matters and vested exclusive authority to act on all personnel matters in the local school superintendent, the district court did not err in affirming the order of the public employee labor relations board that the school board is required to hear and decide appeals from decisions of the school superintendent under grievance procedures set forth in the CBA, because the school board, as the policy maker who negotiated and agreed to the CBA is the appropriate entity to determine whether its own policy, or specific provision in the CBA, has been violated, misinterpreted, or misapplied.Alarcon v. Albuquerque Pub. Schs. Bd. of Educ., 2018-NMCA-021, cert. denied.\n\nSchool board's supervision and discharge of superintendent.— Inherent in the power given to the school board to employ a superintendent is the ability for the board to supervise and discharge a superintendent.Stanley v. Raton Bd. of Educ., 1994-NMSC-059, 117 N.M. 717, 876 P.2d 232.\n\nEmployment of administrators.— The school board effectively terminated the plaintiffs' employment as school administrators by declaring the jobs vacant, and therefore met the obligations under this section. The plaintiffs could reasonably infer from the board's actions that they were not reemployed for the next year.Naranjo v. Board of Educ., 1995-NMSC-015, 119 N.M. 401, 891 P.2d 542.\n\nSchool districts and their governing boards in New Mexicoare not arms of the state, and they are accordingly not shielded by the Eleventh Amendment from liability for a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action in federal court.Duke v. Grady Mun. Schs., 127 F.3d 972 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\nLiability of local board under federal civil rights law.— In an action brought by a school employee against a school district local school board under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the board was a \"person\" for purposes of the suit, and the action under such law was not barred by any statutory governmental immunity.Daddow v. Carlsbad Mun. Sch. Dist., 1995-NMSC-032, 120 N.M. 97, 898 P.2d 1235.\n\nA school board is the policymaking body of its local school district and retains the responsibility of formally approving expenditures during board meetings.— The Public School Finance Act, 22-8-1 to 22-8-49 NMSA 1978, and the Public School Code, 22-5-1 to 22-35-5 NMSA 1978, provide that school boards are authorized to approve school district budgets and disbursements of school district funds, whether by voucher, warrants, or checks of the local school board, and although individual school board members may discuss and vote to disapprove expenditures, made in any form, during school board meetings and may question, address, or vote against these items in an opening meeting, only the board as a whole, with all the members or a quorum thereof present, can take official action and formally approve or disapprove school district expenditures in convened sessions. 2024 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 24-11.\n\nNo power to create police department.— A local school board does not have the authority to create and fund an independent police department without specific legislative authority. 2007 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 07-07.\n\nUse of public funds to defend actions involving misconduct.— Public funding may be used to defend public school districts, boards and employees in legal actions involving misconduct if the charges arise from the discharge of an official duty in which the government has an interest; the public employee was acting in good faith when the alleged wrongful conduct occurred; the employing government entity has express or implied legal authority to pay the employee's legal expenses; the employee is exonerated of the charges; and the decision to pay the legal fees is made by an impartial official or official body. 2007 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 07-03.\n\nConditions under which private group may use facilities.— A local board of education may permit a particular religious denomination or private group to use public school buildings or facilities after school hours where such use, in the opinion of the school board, will not interfere with normal school activities, but the board may not in any respect sanction or give endorsement to such religious denominational programs. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-106.\n\nInclude equal treatment of all groups.— A local school board must, in exercising its discretion as to whether a particular religious denomination may use public school facilities after school hours, either make the use of school facilities available to all religious groups on an equal basis and without preference as to any particular group or not permit such use at all. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-106.\n\nAnd reimbursement of school's actual expenses.— Since a school district may not in any manner lend its financial or other support to any private religious denominations, it is incumbent upon school authorities to obtain reimbursement for any actual expenses occasioned from a religious group's private use of public school facilities. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-106.\n\nPayment for time spent away from district by district employee.— A local school district employee who serves on the state board of education may draw salary from the district and per diem and expenses from the state department of education; however, he may not be paid for time spent away from his duties with the district unless he takes authorized leave with pay. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-45.\n\nCharacter of private use determines whether state approval required.— Where a local school board desires to enter into a lease of real property to any private party or religious group and proposes to give exclusive right of possession and occupancy to school lands or buildings, the state board of finance must give its approval pursuant to Section 13-6-2 NMSA 1978. Where, however, the use permitted is temporary or brief and limited to hours when the property is not needed for school purposes, the approval of the state board of finance is not necessary, and the local board of education may or may not authorize such usage according to its discretion. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-106.\n\nSchool board attendance allocation proper.— So long as the statutory and constitutional minimum educational standards are satisfied, the local school board may allocate attendance within the district. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-36.\n\nSchool boards have authority to enact reasonable regulationsrelating to the suspension or expulsion of students. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-214.\n\nRegulating married students.— A rule or regulation prohibiting married students from participating in band, glee club, dramatic events, school newspapers, school clubs, school sponsored trips and school athletics is arbitrary and unreasonable and therefore void. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-117.\n\nPregnant students.— A rule which would require the withdrawal of a student when it is known that she is pregnant and when the school officials do not believe that such attendance is proper clearly violates the compulsory attendance law; therefore if the girl is physically capable of attending school, the local school board may not prohibit her attendance by rule or regulation merely because she is pregnant. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-117.\n\nSchool boards have authority to ban smoking.— Because local school boards have authority to supervise and control all public schools within their district, they can use that authority to ban smoking by both adults and minors on all public school campuses within their district. 1994 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 94-03.\n\nSchool board president's authority.— A local school board president has authority to deny citizens the right to address the local school board during a meeting of the board, if he is authorized to do so by rules promulgated by the board and he does not exercise that authority arbitrarily or capriciously. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-26.\n\nHealth club memberships for employees.— A school district may spend public funds to provide its full time employees with membership in a private health club if the membership is provided in return for services rendered to the district. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-20.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 68 Am.

An individual school within a school district may establish a school discipline policy, provided that parents, school personnel and students are involved in its development and a public hearing is held in the school prior to its adoption. If an individual school adopts a discipline policy in addition to the local school board's school district discipline policy, it shall submit its policy to the local school board for approval.\n\nD.
