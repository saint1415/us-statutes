      "text": "The legislature finds that:\n\nA. while state and federal combined funding for New Mexico's bilingual multicultural education programs was forty-one million dollars ($41,000,000) in 2003, the funds do not directly support bilingual multicultural education program instruction;\n\nB. the state's bilingual multicultural education program goals are for all students, including English language learners, to:\n\n(1) become bilingual and biliterate in English and a second language, including Spanish, a Native American language, where a written form exists and there is tribal approval, or another language; and\n\n(2) meet state academic content standards and benchmarks in all subject areas;\n\nC. districts do not fully understand how to properly assess, place and monitor students in bilingual multicultural education programs so that the students may become academically successful;\n\nD. because inaccurate reporting on student participation in bilingual multicultural education programs has a direct impact on state and federal funding, accountability measures are necessary to track bilingual multicultural education program funds;\n\nE. the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 does not preclude using state funds for bilingual multicultural education programs;\n\nF. Article 12, Section 8 of the constitution of New Mexico recognizes the value of bilingualism as an educational tool;\n\nG. professional development is needed for district employees, including teachers, teacher assistants, principals, bilingual directors or coordinators, associate superintendents, superintendents and financial officers in the areas of:\n\n(1) research-based bilingual multicultural education programs and implications for instruction;\n\n(2) best practices of English as a second language, English language development and bilingual multicultural education programs; and\n\n(3) classroom assessments that support academic and language development;\n\nH. parents in conjunction with teachers and other district employees shall be empowered to decide what type of bilingual multicultural education program works best for their children and their community. Districts shall also provide parents with appropriate training in English or in the home or heritage language to help their children succeed in school;\n\nI. because research has shown that it takes five to seven years to acquire academic proficiency in a second language, priority should be given to programs that adequately support a child's linguistic development. The state shall, therefore, fund bilingual multicultural education programs for students in grades kindergarten through three before funding bilingual multicultural education programs at higher grade levels;\n\nJ. a standardized curriculum, including instructional materials with scope and sequence, is necessary to ensure that the bilingual multicultural education program is consistent and building on the language skills the students have previously learned. The instructional materials for Native American bilingual multicultural education programs shall be written, when permitted by the Indian nation, tribe or pueblo, and if written materials are not available, an oral standardized curriculum shall be implemented;\n\nK. equitable and culturally relevant learning environments, educational opportunities and culturally relevant instructional materials for all students participating in the program. For Native American students enrolled in public schools, equitable and culturally relevant learning environments, educational opportunities and culturally relevant instructional materials are required to satisfy a goal of the Indian Education Act [Chapter 22, Article 23A NMSA 1978]; and\n\nL. the Bilingual Multicultural Education Act will ensure equal education opportunities for students in New Mexico. Cognitive and affective development of the students is encouraged by:\n\n(1) using the cultural and linguistic backgrounds of the students in a bilingual multicultural education program;\n\n(2) providing students with opportunities to expand their conceptual and linguistic abilities and potentials in a successful and positive manner; and\n\n(3) teaching students to appreciate the value and beauty of different languages and cultures.\n\nHistory:Laws 2004, ch. 32, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For the federal No Child Left Behind Act,see20 U.S.C., § 6301.",
