State, 1996-NMSC-001, 121 N.M. 212, 910 P.2d 288.\n\nBecause the retirement plan provided no contractual or vested right to receive an irrevocable tax exemption, there was no constitutionally protected private interest in the tax exemption and there was no due process violation when the exemption was repealed.Pierce v. State, 1996-NMSC-001, 121 N.M. 212, 910 P.2d 288.\n\n\"Trading\" tax exemptions for health care.— Repeal of the state income tax exemptions for teacher pensions and public employee pensions does not remedy constitutional defects of the proposed retiree health care act under a theory that those exemptions would be \"traded\" for retiree health care. Those exemptions are not property rights, irrepealable contractual entitlements, or pension benefits. Hence, elimination of the favorable tax treatment for current retirees is not consideration for a multi-million dollar health care plan that the state proposes to provide them. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen.

State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1982-NMCA-112, 98 N.M. 362, 648 P.2d 820, superseded by statute,Pierce v. State, 1996-NMSC-001, 121 N.M. 212, 910 P.2d 288.\n\nRepeal of tax exemption.— Because no private contractual rights were granted by the retirement plan, there was no impairment or breach of contract resulting from the 1990 repeal of the tax exemption provision and, although the plan conferred property rights that vested upon accumulating minimum earned service credits, those rights did not include the right to receive pension benefits exempt from tax.Pierce v. State, 1996-NMSC-001, 121 N.M. 212, 910 P.2d 288.\n\nBecause the retirement plan provided no contractual or vested right to receive an irrevocable tax exemption, there was no constitutionally protected private interest in the tax exemption and there was no due process violation when the exemption was repealed.Pierce v. State, 1996-NMSC-001, 121 N.M. 212, 910 P.2d 288.\n\n\"Trading\" tax exemptions for health care.— Repeal of the state income tax exemptions for teacher pensions and public employee pensions does not remedy constitutional defects of the proposed retiree health care act under a theory that those exemptions would be \"traded\" for retiree health care. Those exemptions are not property rights, irrepealable contractual entitlements, or pension benefits. Hence, elimination of the favorable tax treatment for current retirees is not consideration for a multi-million dollar health care plan that the state proposes to provide them. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen.
