If the state or a school district that has been authorized to issue bonds, or is in the process of obtaining authorization to issue bonds, desires to designate all or any portion of the bonds as qualified school construction bonds, it shall submit an application to the council for an allocation distribution. For bonds to be issued in calendar year 2010, the application shall be submitted no later than the last day of the third month following the month in which this 2010 act is first effective; and, for bonds to be issued in any subsequent year in which an allocation exists, the application shall be submitted no later than March 1 of that year. The application shall include evidence that the requirements of Paragraphs (1) and (2) of Subsection A of Section 22-18C-3 NMSA 1978 have been satisfied; provided, however, that any school district to which a direct allocation is made pursuant to Section 1521 of the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 shall be exempt from the application requirement to the extent that the amount of qualified school construction bonds to be issued by that district does not exceed the direct allocation.\n\nD.
