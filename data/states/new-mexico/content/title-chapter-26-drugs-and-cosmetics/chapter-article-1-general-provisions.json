Whenever an authorized agent of the board has probable cause to believe that any drug, device or cosmetic is adulterated, misbranded or counterfeit, he shall affix to such article appropriate marking, giving notice that the article is suspected of being adulterated, misbranded or counterfeit and has been detained or embargoed, and warning all persons not to remove or dispose of such article until permission for removal or disposal is given by the agent or the court. It is unlawful for any person to remove or dispose of such detained or embargoed article without such permission.\n\nB. When an article detained or embargoed has been found by the agent to be adulterated, misbranded or counterfeit he shall petition the judge of the district court in whose jurisdiction the article is detained or embargoed for a libel for condemnation of such article. When the agent has found that an article so detained or embargoed is not adulterated, misbranded or counterfeit he shall remove the marking.\n\nC. If the court finds that a detained or embargoed article is adulterated or misbranded or counterfeit, the article shall, after entry of the decree, be destroyed at the expense of the claimant under the supervision of the agent, and all court costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses shall be taxed against the claimant of the article or his agent. However, when the adulteration or misbranding can be corrected by proper labeling or processing of the article, the court, after entry of the decree and after costs, fees and expenses have been paid and a sufficient bond has been executed, conditioned that the article shall be so labeled or processed, may by order direct that the article be delivered to the claimant for labeling or processing under the supervision of an agent of the board. The expense of the supervision shall be paid by the claimant. The bond shall be returned to the claimant of the article on representation to the court by the board that the article is no longer in violation of the New Mexico Drug and Cosmetic Act [New Mexico Drug Device and Cosmetic Act] and that the expenses of the supervision have been paid.\n\nD. The following may be seized by a duly authorized law enforcement official of the state whenever he has reasonable grounds to believe they are:\n\n(1) a drug other than a controlled substance, that is counterfeit;\n\n(2) a container of a counterfeit drug;\n\n(3) any punch, die, plate, stone, labeling, container or other thing used or designed for use in making a counterfeit drug or drugs.\n\nE. When an article, equipment or other thing is seized under Section 6D [26-1-6D NMSA 1978] of the New Mexico Drug and Cosmetic Act [New Mexico Drug Device and Cosmetic Act], the proceedings shall be brought in the name of the state by the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the article was seized, and the libel shall be verified by a duly authorized agent of the state in a manner required by the law of this state. The libel shall describe the merchandise, state its location, state the name of the person in actual possession, state the name of the owner, if known to the duly authorized agent of the state, allege the essential elements of the violation which is claimed to exist and shall conclude with a prayer of due process to enforce the forfeiture. Upon the filing of libel the court shall properly cause process to issue to the authorized law enforcement official commanding him to seize the goods described in the libel and to hold the same for further order of the court. The authorized law enforcement official shall at the time of seizure serve a copy of said process upon the owner of said merchandise. Such service may be made personally, by mail or by publication according to the rules governing the service of civil process in this state. At the expiration of twenty days after such seizure, if no claimant has appeared to defend the libel, the court shall order the authorized law enforcement official to dispose of said merchandise.\n\nF. Any person having an interest in the alleged article, equipment or other thing proceeded against, or any person against whom a civil or criminal liability would exist if said merchandise is in violation of Section 3 [26-1-3 NMSA 1978] of the New Mexico Drug and Cosmetic Act [New Mexico Drug Device and Cosmetic Act] may, within twenty days following the authorized law enforcement official's seizure, appear and file answer or demurrer to the libel. The answer or demurrer shall allege the interest or liability of the party filing it. In all other respects the issue shall be made up as in other civil actions.\n\nG. Any article, equipment or other thing condemned under this section shall, after entry of the decree, be disposed of by destruction or sale as the court may, in accordance with the provisions of this section, direct and the proceeds, if sold, less the legal costs and charges, shall be paid to the general fund; but such article, equipment or other thing shall not be sold under such decree contrary to provisions of the New Mexico Drug and Cosmetic Act [New Mexico Drug Device and Cosmetic Act]. Whenever in any proceedings under this section the condemnation of any equipment or other thing, other than a drug, is decreed, the court shall allow the claim of any claimant, to the extent of such claimant's interest, for remission or mitigation of such forfeiture if such claimant proves to the satisfaction of the court that he has not committed or caused to be committed any prohibited act referred to in this section and has no interest in any drug referred to therein; that he has an interest in such equipment or other thing as owner or lienor or otherwise, acquired by him in good faith; and that he at no time had any knowledge or reason to believe that such equipment or other thing was being or would be used in, or to facilitate, the violation of the laws of this state relating to counterfeit drugs.\n\nH. When a decree of condemnation is entered against the article, equipment or other thing, court costs and fees and storage and other proper expenses may be awarded against the person, if any, intervening as claimant of the article.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 54-6-31, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 23, § 6; 1971, ch. 241, § 1; 1972, ch. 84, § 45.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.

Ass'n v. N.M. Bd. of Pharmacy, 1974-NMCA-038, 86 N.M. 571, 525 P.2d 931, cert. quashed, 86 N.M. 657, 526 P.2d 799.\n\nLicensing of detailmen allowed.— Reviewing courts overturn the administrative interpretation of statute by appropriate agencies only if they are clearly incorrect. Since detailmen handle controlled drugs and are part of the interstate drug shipment operation, even though they do not ship drugs themselves, the interpretation by the board of pharmacy of Section 26-1-16 NMSA 1978 to allow licensing of detailmen is not clearly erroneous and will not be overturned by a reviewing court.Pharmaceutical Mfrs.

The comments of the one board member suffice in this regard.Pharmaceutical Mfrs. Ass'n v. N.M.
