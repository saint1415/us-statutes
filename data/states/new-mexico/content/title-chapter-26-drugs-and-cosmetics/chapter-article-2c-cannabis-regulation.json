Except for verification of age, the division shall not require licensees to request information from consumers or impose any residency requirement upon consumers for the purchase of commercial cannabis products.

Except as otherwise provided in the Cannabis Regulation Act, the division shall not limit the number of licensed premises a licensee may occupy or operate under a license. Multiple licensees may occupy a single licensed premises, and the division shall not place any restriction or prohibition on the number of licensees occupying a single licensed premises or on the number of licensed premises of a cannabis establishment except as otherwise specifically provided for by that act. A licensee may conduct any lawful activity or any combination of lawful activities at a licensed premises except that a cannabis licensee shall not occupy any premises that also houses a business holding a license under the Liquor Control Act [60-3A-1 NMSA 1978] that allows the sale or giving away of alcoholic beverages by the glass or package, including growlers, to the public or to members of a private club or otherwise allows consumption of alcohol on the premises.\n\nK.

Licensees are specifically allowed to conduct other licensed activities, including activities pursuant to the Hemp Manufacturing Act [Chapter 76, Article 24 NMSA 1978] and the Liquor Control Act except for co-location as specified in Subsection J of this section.\n\nM.

As to activity under the medical cannabis program, the licensee shall continue to operate under rules promulgated for the medical cannabis program until the division promulgates rules for medical cannabis activity, and a qualified patient, primary caregiver or reciprocal participant shall not be prohibited from purchasing and obtaining cannabis products through the medical cannabis program.\n\nN. To address a shortage of cannabis supply in the medical cannabis program, the division may:\n\n(1) require all cannabis establishment licensees to ensure that at least ten percent of their cannabis in stock on a monthly basis is designated for sale to qualified patients, primary caregivers and reciprocal participants;\n\n(2) initially take reasonable measures to expeditiously incentivize increased production of cannabis plants to remedy a shortage of cannabis supply in the medical cannabis program;\n\n(3) after having first exhausted measures to increase production of cannabis plants to address the shortage of cannabis supply in the medical cannabis program, exclude commercial cannabis activity from the scope of new licenses issued to initial applicants for a vertically integrated cannabis establishment, cannabis producer, integrated cannabis microbusiness, cannabis producer microbusiness or cannabis manufacturer license, which limitation shall be in force for a period of at least six months; and\n\n(4) require licensees who are licensed to produce cannabis to produce a specified quota of mature cannabis plants to be designated for use in the medical cannabis program; provided that:\n\n(a) the division may require a licensee to devote no more than twenty-five percent of the licensee's cultivated cannabis plants on a monthly basis for use in the medical cannabis program; and\n\n(b) the division may require specific tracking of cannabis plants.\n\nO.
