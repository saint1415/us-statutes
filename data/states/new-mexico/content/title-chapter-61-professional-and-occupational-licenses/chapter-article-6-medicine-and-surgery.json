      "text": "A. Chapter 61, Article 6 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Medical Practice Act\".\n\nB. In the interest of the public health, safety and welfare and to protect the public from the improper, unprofessional, incompetent and unlawful practice of medicine, it is necessary to provide laws and rules controlling the granting and use of the privilege to practice medicine and to establish a medical board to implement and enforce the laws and rules.\n\nC. The primary duties and obligations of the medical board are to issue licenses to qualified health care practitioners, including physicians, physician assistants and anesthesiologist assistants, to discipline incompetent or unprofessional physicians, physician assistants or anesthesiologist assistants and to aid in the rehabilitation of impaired physicians, physician assistants and anesthesiologist assistants for the purpose of protecting the public.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 61-6-1, enacted by Laws 1989, ch. 269, § 1; 2003, ch. 19, § 1; 2021, ch. 54, § 16.\n\nRecompilations.— Laws 1989, ch. 269, § 2 recompiled former 61-6-1 NMSA 1978, relating to appointment, qualifications and terms of board of medical examiners, as 61-6-2 NMSA 1978, effective July 1, 1989.\n\nCross references.— For Sexual Assault Survivors Emergency Care Act,see24-10D-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective June 18, 2021, in Subsection C, after \"qualified\", added \"health care practitioners, including\".\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, substituted \"medical board\" for \"board of medical examiners\" in Subsections B and C; in Subsection C, inserted \"anesthesiologist assistants\" three times and deleted \"to register qualified\" preceding \"physician assistants\".\n\nLicense requirement does not violate first amendment rights.— The Medical Practice Act does not purport to regulate the expression of ideas or opinions concerning effective treatments or other issues of public concern, nor does it require all speakers at seminars held in New Mexico to be licensed to practice in New Mexico. The act simply requires those who engage in conduct in New Mexico that amounts to the practice of medicine to obtain a New Mexico license. Thus, any burden on the exercise of first amendment rights is at best minimal and incidental, and the act leaves open alternative channels of communication through which ideas and opinions can be expressed.State v.

A board member failing to attend three consecutive meetings, either regular or special, shall automatically be removed as a member of the board unless excused from attendance by the board for good cause shown.\n\nHistory:Laws 1923, ch. 44, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 110-101; 1941 Comp., § 51-501; Laws 1949, ch. 139, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 67-5-1; Laws 1955, ch. 44 [§ 1]; 1969, ch. 46, § 1; 1979, ch. 40, § 1; 1978 Comp., § 61-6-1, recompiled as § 61-6-2 by Laws 1989, ch. 269, § 2; 1991, ch. 189, § 9; 2003, ch. 19, § 2; 2021, ch. 54, § 17.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 1989, ch. 269, § 32 repealed former 61-6-2 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1955, ch. 44, § 1, relating to meetings and quorums of the board, effective July 1, 1989. For present comparable provisions,see61-6-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nCross references.— For Uniform Licensing Act,see61-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective June 18, 2021, increased the number of members of the New Mexico medical board from nine members to eleven members, increased the number of physicians to be appointed to the board, required that at least two of the members be osteopathic physicians and two of the members be medical physicians, and prohibited health care practitioners over which the board has licensure authority from being public members of the board; in Subsection A, after \"consisting of\", changed \"nine\" to \"eleven\", after \"physician assistant and\", changed \"six\" to \"eight\", after \"reputable physicians\", added \"at least two of whom shall be osteopathic physicians and at least two of whom shall be medical physicians. The osteopathic physicians and the medical physicians shall be\", and after \"shall not have been licensed by the board\", deleted \"or have practiced as a physician\" and added \"as a health care provider over which the board has licensure authority\"; and added a new Subsection C and redesignated former Subsections C through E as Subsections D through F, respectively.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2021, ch. 54, § 48 provided:\n\nA. On June 18, 2021, all functions, personnel, money, appropriations, records, furniture, equipment, supplies and other property of the board of osteopathic medicine are transferred to the New Mexico medical board.\n\nB. On June 18, 2021, all contractual obligations of the board of osteopathic medicine are binding on the New Mexico medical board.\n\nC. On June 18, 2021, all references in law to the board of osteopathic medicine shall be deemed to be references to the New Mexico medical board.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, substituted \"New Mexico medical board\" for \"Board of medical examiners\" in the section heading; in Subsection A, substituted \"'New Mexico medical board, consisting of nine members\" for \"board of medical examiners, consisting of eight members\" in the first sentence, inserted \"one physician assistant\" preceding \"and six reputable\", deleted \"as defined in Section 61-6-6 NMSA 1978\" in the second sentence, inserted the present third sentence, and inserted \"by the board\" in the last sentence; added present Subsection C and redesignated former Subsections C and D as Subsections D and E, and rewrote present Subsection D.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2003, ch. 19, § 28, effective June 20, 2003, provided that all functions, personnel, appropriations, money, records, equipment, supplies and other property of the New Mexico board of medical examiners shall be transferred to the New Mexico medical board; all contracts of the New Mexico board of medical examiners shall be binding and effective on the New Mexico medical board; and all references in law to the New Mexico board of medical examiners shall be deemed to be references to the New Mexico medical board.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, in Subsection A, increased the membership of the board from six members to eight members and, in the second sentence, substituted \"two public members and six reputable physicians\" for \"one public member and five reputable physicians\" and \"licensed physicians\" for \"registered practitioners\"; deleted former Subsection C which read \"Two of the physician members of the board first appointed shall hold their offices for a period of two years, and the remaining three physician members shall hold their offices for a period of four years. Thereafter, the physician members shall hold their offices for a period of four years. All board members shall hold office until their successors are appointed and qualified\"; designated former Subsections D and E as Subsections C and D, rewriting present Subsection C which read \"The public member shall be appointed to a four-year term\"; and made related and minor stylistic changes in Subsections A and B.\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective July 1, 1989, renumbered this section, which formerly was 61-6-1 NMSA 1978; inserted \"or schools\" near the middle of the second sentence of Subsection A; substituted the present provisions of Subsection D for \" The public member, upon the effective date of this act, shall be appointed to a term expiring January 1, 1982. Thereafter the public member shall be appointed to a four-year term\"; substituted all of the present language of Subsection E following \"removed\" for \"as a member of this board\"; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nGovernor's power not usurped.— Requirement that the governor appoint to the board of medical examiner's nominees who were submitted by the New Mexico medical society, where only the governor has this prerogative, would not unconstitutionally usurp the governor's power.Seidenberg v.

Exam'rs, 1969-NMSC-028, 80 N.M. 135, 452 P.2d 469.\n\nReview of board's proceedings.— On review of proceedings of board of medical examiners, court is limited to a determination of whether the board's order was reasonable, lawful and had substantial evidence to support it.Seidenberg v. N.M. Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 1969-NMSC-028, 80 N.M. 135, 452 P.2d 469.\n\nCorporation to perform medical services.— Because the legislature chose to expressly prohibit the corporate practice, apart from professional corporations, in the case of dentists and podiatrists, and chose to expressly permit, with limitation, other forms of corporate practice in the case of psychologists and engineers, it may be inferred from the legislature's silence in the case of medical doctors that a corporation may be formed to provide medical services. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-39.\n\nA corporation, organized and controlled by non-physicians, may provide medical services to the general public through employed physicians, unless prohibited by statute or unless it exercises lay control of medical judgment or engages in lay exploitation of the medical profession in a manner prohibited by public policy. 1987 Op.

The board may refuse to license and may revoke or suspend a license that has been issued by the board or a previous board and may fine, censure or reprimand a licensee upon satisfactory proof being made to the board that the applicant for or holder of the license has been guilty of unprofessional or dishonorable conduct.

If evidence fails to establish to the satisfaction of the board that the licensee is competent and is of good moral character or if evidence shows that the licensee has not complied with the terms of probation, the board may revoke or suspend the license. If a license to practice in this state is suspended, the holder of the license may not practice during the term of suspension. A person whose license has been revoked or suspended by the board and who thereafter practices or attempts or offers to practice in New Mexico, unless the period of suspension has expired or been modified by the board or the license reinstated, is guilty of a felony and shall be punished as provided in Section 61-6-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nD. \"Unprofessional or dishonorable conduct\", as used in this section, means, but is not limited to because of enumeration, conduct of a licensee that includes the following:\n\n(1) procuring, aiding or abetting an illegal procedure;\n\n(2) employing a person to solicit patients for the licensee;\n\n(3) representing to a patient that a manifestly incurable condition of sickness, disease or injury can be cured;\n\n(4) obtaining a fee by fraud or misrepresentation;\n\n(5) willfully or negligently divulging a professional confidence;\n\n(6) conviction of an offense punishable by incarceration in a state penitentiary or federal prison or conviction of a misdemeanor associated with the practice of the licensee.

and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nDue process.— Former Subsection D(27) (now Subsection D(29)) of this section, defining \"unprofessional or dishonorable conduct\" to include conduct unbecoming in one licensed to practice medicine or detrimental to the best interests of the public, is not void for vagueness.McDaniel v. N.M. Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 1974-NMSC-062, 86 N.M. 447, 525 P.2d 374.\n\nTerms of probation not unconstitutionally vague.— Where one of the terms of probation imposed by the board on a physician found guilty of unprofessional conduct for falsely prescribing demerol for the alleged use of another when in fact the drug was for personal use was that the doctor not take or have in the doctor's possession \"any dangerous drugs\" without the consent of a psychiatrist, and the physician thereafter prescribed the drug ritalin for a patient and diverted some of it for personal use, revocation of the physician's license for violating probation was justified, as under the facts the terms thereof were not unconstitutionally vague.McDaniel v. N.M. Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 1974-NMSC-062, 86 N.M. 447, 525 P.2d 374.\n\nPrior judicial determination unnecessary.— An administrative determination of \"unlawful, illegal or unauthorized\" conduct sufficient to support a conclusion of \"unprofessional conduct,\" as provided in this section, is not dependent upon a prior judicial determination of criminal guilt.Strance v. N.M. Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 1971-NMSC-081, 83 N.M. 15, 487 P.2d 1085.\n\nRestraint of proceedings.— Board of medical examiners has exclusive jurisdiction regarding the granting and revoking of certificates admitting physicians and surgeons to practice, and as statutes do not provide for disqualification of board members, proceedings before the board may not be restrained merely by reason of the fact that the board itself initiated the proceedings against a physician and was, therefore, an interested party.Seidenberg v. N.M. Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 1969-NMSC-028, 80 N.M. 135, 452 P.2d 469.\n\nSubsection D(5) does not create privilege;it only describes ethical constraints placed upon a physician.Trujillo v. Puro, 1984-NMCA-050, 101 N.M. 408, 683 P.2d 963, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 362, 683 P.2d 44.\n\nReinstatement after revocation.— Board of medical examiners has the power to suspend a license inherent in its power to revoke, but when revocation is accomplished, the only method of reinstating revoked licensee to full privileges is by the means of reapplication. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5839.\n\nUnder former law, the legislature did not define unprofessional conduct,nor prohibit advertising by physicians; former statute did not go far enough to give power to the board of medical examiners to revoke the license of a physician for advertising unless said advertising was false, immoral and against the public welfare. 1939 Op. Att'y Gen.
