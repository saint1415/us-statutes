The board shall post the lists of unapproved and approved licensing jurisdictions on the board's website. The list of disapproved licensing jurisdictions shall include the specific reasons for disapproval. The lists shall be reviewed annually to determine if amendments to the rule are warranted.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 67-2-7, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 44, § 7; 1977, ch. 220, § 4; 1991, ch. 190, § 6; 1997, ch. 244, § 6; 2003, ch. 276, § 4; 2003, ch. 307, § 7; 2022, ch. 39, § 14.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective May 18, 2022, provided that the board of nursing is subject to the provisions of the State Rules Act for promulgating rules and to the Uniform Licensing Act for licensing and disciplinary matters, required the board of nursing to determine by rule, and to post on its website, which states and territories of the United States or the District of Columbia from which the board will not accept an applicant for expedited licensure and those foreign countries from which the board will accept an applicant for expedited licensure, required that the list of disapproved licensing jurisdictions include a reason for disapproval, and required the board to review the lists annually to determine if amendments to the rule are needed; in Subsection A, after \"shall\", deleted \"adopt and revise such\" and added \"promulgate\", and after \"rules\", deleted \"and regulations\" and added \"in accordance with the State Rules Act\"; redesignated former Subsections G through R as Subsections H through S, respectively; in Subsection G, added \"conduct hearings upon charges related to an applicant or discipline of a licensee\"; in Subsection H, after \"prosecution of\", deleted \"all\", after \"persons\", deleted \"including firms, associations, institutions and corporations\", and after \"is necessary\", deleted \"therefor\" and added \"for the prosecution\"; and added Subsection T.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2022, ch. 39, § 104 provided that a board that is required by Laws 2022, ch. 39 to change its licensing provisions to allow for new or different expedited licensure shall have rules in place and operational by January 1, 2023.\n\n2003 Amendments.— Laws 2003, ch. 307, § 7, effective January 1, 2004, substituted \"if\" for \"provided that\" following \"prescribed standards\" near the end of Subsection D; inserted \"or nurse not licensed to practice in New Mexico who is permitted to practice professional registered nursing or licensed practical nursing in New Mexico pursuant to a multistate licensure privilege as provided in the Nurse Licensure Compact\" following \"discipline of a licensee\" near the middle of Subsection F; and added a new Subsection Q and redesignated former Subsection Q as Subsection R.\n\nLaws 2003, ch. 276, § 4, effective June 20, 2003, at the end of Subsection Q inserted \"and certified registered nurse anesthetists\".\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective June 20, 1997, substituted \"who\" for \"and\" preceding \"shall define\" in Subsection J, added \"and shall study methods of monitoring continuing competence\" at the end of Subsection L, substituted \"license qualified\" for \"endorse the qualifications of\" at the beginning of Subsection P, and added Subsection Q.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, substituted \"educational\" for \"education\" in Subsections D and L; substituted \"at least one member who is a board member and at least two members\" for \"at least three members\" in Subsection M; added Subsections O and P; and made a minor stylistic change in Subsection J and a related stylistic change in Subsection M.\n\nVolunteers for the board of nursing would likely be covered under the liability policies for the state of New Mexico.— The New Mexico Tort Claims Act explicitly contemplates that volunteers acting on behalf of the government may be considered public employees subject to its protections and to its waivers of those protections, 41-4-3(F)(3) NMSA 1978, and therefore, volunteers charged with reviewing complaints and making recommendations to the nursing board regarding potential disciplinary action against licensees would likely be deemed public employees acting on behalf or in service of a governmental entity, and liability policies of the state of New Mexico likely would cover negligent acts by these volunteers.Use of Volunteers at the New Mexico State Board of Nursing(11/26/18), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2018-09.\n\nThe nursing board's use of volunteer committee members to assist the board in the approval of nursing programs does not violate the law.— The Nursing Practice Act provides that the nursing board is authorized to prescribe standards and approve curricula for educational programs preparing persons for licensure under the Nursing Practice Act and is authorized to appoint advisory committees consisting of at least one member who is a board member and at least two members expert in the pertinent field of health care to assist it in the performance of its duties, and the New Mexico board of nursing employee policies set forth qualifications of committee members for each of the board's advisory committees. The board of nursing's practice of allowing volunteer committee members to make site visits for the purpose of assisting the board in approval of nursing programs, therefore, appears to comply with the law and is appropriate based on the required qualifications of the committee members.Use of Volunteers at the New Mexico State Board of Nursing(11/26/18), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2018-09.\n\nApplicability of the Open Meetings Act to volunteer nursing board advisory committees.— The Open Meetings Act, 10-15-1 to 10-15-4 NMSA 1978, applies to a quorum of members of any board or commission or other policy making body of any state agency held for the purpose of formulating public policy or taking any action within the authority of, or the delegated authority of, any board or commission or other policymaking body, and therefore, meetings of a volunteer advisory committee appointed by the nursing board to provide advice and recommendations to the nursing board on various topics would not implicate the Open Meetings Act, unless the advisory committee includes among its members a quorum of the nursing board, in which case the committee meeting would need to be noticed as a public meeting and the minutes would need to be taken, and any minutes that are taken must be open to public access.Use of Volunteers at the New Mexico State Board of Nursing(11/26/18), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2018-09.\n\nDuplicate certificate.— The board could establish regulations for issuing a duplicate certificate, but no fee could be charged therefor. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-99.\n\nAm.

A nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is provided. The practice of nursing is not limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located. The practice of nursing in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.\n\nF. Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state's single-state license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the single-state license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice nursing in any other party state. Nothing in this compact shall affect the requirements established by a party state for the issuance of a single-state license.\n\nG. Any nurse holding a home state multistate license, on the effective date of this compact, may retain and renew the multistate license issued by the nurse's then-current home state, provided that a nurse who:\n\n(1) changes primary state of residence after this compact's effective date must meet all applicable requirements of Subsection C of Article 3 of the Nurse Licensure Compact to obtain a multistate license from a new home state; or\n\n(2) fails to satisfy the multistate licensure requirements in Subsection C of Article 3 of the Nurse Licensure Compact due to a disqualifying event occurring after this compact's effective date shall be ineligible to retain or renew a multistate license, and the nurse's multistate license shall be revoked or deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the commission.\n\nARTICLE 4 Applications for Licensure in a Party State\n\nA. Upon application for a multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.\n\nB. A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the home state, in only one party state at a time.\n\nC. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving between two party states, the nurse must apply for licensure in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state will be deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the commission.\n\n(1) The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence.\n\n(2) A multistate license shall not be issued by the new home state until the nurse provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate license from the new home state.\n\nD. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a non-party state, the multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid only in the former home state.\n\nARTICLE 5 Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing Boards\n\nA. In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the authority to:\n\n(1) take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state; provided that:\n\n(a) only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a nurse's license issued by the home state; and\n\n(b) for purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action;\n\n(2) issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within that party state;\n\n(3) complete any pending investigations of a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. The licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions;\n\n(4) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located;\n\n(5) obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant, fingerprint or other biometric-based information to the federal bureau of investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the federal bureau of investigation record search on criminal background checks and use the results in making licensure decisions;\n\n(6) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that nurse; and\n\n(7) take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.\n\nB. If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.\n\nC. Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the nurse's participation in an alternative program.\n\nARTICLE 6 Coordinated Licensure Information System and Exchange of Information\n\nA. All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all licensed registered nurses and licensed practical or vocational nurses. This system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement efforts.\n\nB. The commission, in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper procedures for the identification, collection and exchange of information under this compact.\n\nC. All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, denials of applications (with the reasons for such denials) and nurse participation in alternative programs known to the licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed nonpublic or confidential under state law.\n\nD. Current significant investigative information and participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.\n\nE. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate information that may not be shared with non-party states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express permission of the contributing state.\n\nF. Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board shall not be shared with non-party states or disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing the information.\n\nG. Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that information shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system.\n\nH. The compact administrator of each party state shall furnish a uniform data set to the compact administrator of each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum:\n\n(1) identifying information;\n\n(2) licensure data;\n\n(3) information related to alternative program participation; and\n\n(4) other information that may facilitate the administration of this compact, as determined by commission rules.\n\nI. The compact administrator of a party state shall provide all investigative documents and information requested by another party state.\n\nARTICLE 7 Establishment of the Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators\n\nA. The party states hereby create and establish a joint public entity known as the Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators.\n\n(1) The commission is an instrumentality of the party states.\n\n(2) Venue is proper, and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively, in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings.\n\n(3) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\nB. Membership, Voting and Meetings\n\n(1) Each party state shall have and be limited to one administrator. The head of the state licensing board or designee shall be the administrator of this compact for each party state. Any administrator may be removed or suspended from office as provided by the law of the state from which the administrator is appointed.

The commission shall keep minutes that fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of the views expressed. All documents considered in connection with an action shall be identified in such minutes. All minutes and documents of a closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to release by a majority vote of the commission or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nC. The commission shall, by a majority vote of the administrators, prescribe bylaws or rules to govern its conduct as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and exercise the powers of this compact, including but not limited to:\n\n(1) establishing the fiscal year of the commission;\n\n(2) providing reasonable standards and procedures:\n\n(a) for the establishment and meetings of other committees; and\n\n(b) governing any general or specific delegation of any authority or function of the commission;\n\n(3) providing reasonable procedures for calling and conducting meetings of the commission, ensuring reasonable advance notice of all meetings and providing an opportunity for attendance of such meetings by interested parties, with enumerated exceptions designed to protect the public's interest, the privacy of individuals, and proprietary information, including trade secrets.

All hearings will be recorded, and a copy will be made available upon request.\n\n(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.\n\nH.

Enforcement\n\n(1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.\n\n(2) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices against a party state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws.

A party state's withdrawal or termination shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing or terminated state's licensing board to report adverse actions and significant investigations occurring prior to the effective date of such withdrawal or termination.\n\nE. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any nurse licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a non-party state that is made in accordance with the other provisions of this compact.\n\nF. This compact may be amended by the party states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon the party states unless and until it is enacted into the laws of all party states.\n\nG. Representatives of non-party states to this compact shall be invited to participate in the activities of the commission, on a nonvoting basis, prior to the adoption of this compact by all states.\n\nARTICLE 11 Construction and Severability\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States, or if the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
