      "text": "It is unlawful for a person to engage in the business or act in the capacity of real estate associate broker or qualifying broker within New Mexico without a license issued by the commission. A person who engages in the business or acts in the capacity of an associate broker or a qualifying broker in New Mexico, except as otherwise provided in Section 61-29-2 NMSA 1978, with or without a New Mexico real estate broker's license, has thereby submitted to the jurisdiction of the state and to the administrative jurisdiction of the commission and is subject to all penalties and remedies available for a violation of any provision of Chapter 61, Article 29 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 67-24-19, enacted by Laws 1959, ch. 226, § 1; 1965, ch. 304, § 1; 2001, ch. 163, § 1; 2005, ch. 35, § 1; 2013, ch. 167, § 1.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective June 14, 2013, clarified the prohibited activities; in the first sentence, after \"engage in the business\", added \"or\", and after \"act in the capacity of\", deleted \"advertise or display in any manner or otherwise assume to engage in the business of, or act as an\", added \"real estate\" and in the second sentence, after \"with or without a New Mexico\" added \"real estate broker's\".\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective January 1, 2006, prohibits a person from engaging in business or acting as an associate broker or a qualifying broker without a license.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, substituted \"a person to engage\" for \"any person, business association or corporation to engage\"; deleted \"real estate\" preceding \"broker\"; deleted \"New Mexico real estate\" preceding \"commission\"; and added the last sentence of the subsection.\n\nBrokerage can encompass sale of interest in real estate contract.— Commission had jurisdiction over real estate broker's sale of an interest in a real estate contract since broker was a real estate broker as defined in Section 61-29-2A(4) NMSA 1978 and represented himself as such and acted in that capacity.Elliott v. N.M. Real Estate Comm'n, 1985-NMSC-078, 103 N.M. 273, 705 P.2d 679.\n\nPayment of a finder's fee to an unlicensed real estate broker prohibited.— Where a Chapter 7 trustee filed a motion to sell debtors' house, and where the terms of the proposed sale included a proposed finder's fee for creditor, an unlicensed real estate broker who introduced the buyers of the house to the trustee, the proposed finder's fee was prohibited by this section, because the creditor, as an unlicensed broker in New Mexico, may not collect a finder's fee or any other compensation from the sale of real estate.In re Waggoner, 605 B.R. 222 (Bankr. D. N.M. 2019).\n\nGenerally, as to advertisements violating section.— It is a violation of this section for a person, business firm or corporation to advertise the disposition of real estate using the terms \"Real Estate Agency,\" \"Realty,\" \"Agency\" or \"Broker\" without first being licensed as a real estate broker as is defined in Section 61-29-2 NMSA 1978. It is not really important whether or not the person, business firm or corporation doing the advertising uses the terms \"Real Estate Agency,\" \"Realty,\" \"Agency\" or \"Broker.\" The real question is: have they advertised themselves as offering a service which comes within the definition of a real estate broker and a real estate salesman? 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-16.\n\nA person who auctions the real estate of another person for compensation is acting as an associate or qualifying broker.— The Real Estate Brokers and Salesmen Act (act), 61-29-1 to 61-29-29 NMSA 1978, specifically lists auctioning or the offer to auction real estate, when performed for another and for compensation, as conduct that brings one within the definition of associate broker and qualifying broker, and therefore a person who auctions or offers for auction the real estate of another person for compensation is acting as an associate or qualifying broker under the act and must possess a broker's license issued by the New Mexico real estate commission, regardless of whether the auctioneer is hired by the seller or by a licensed broker.Necessity of a Real Estate Broker's License to Auction Real Estate(5/24/16), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2016-05.\n\nRule governing advertisements applies to advertisements of real estate auctions.— The New Mexico real estate commission has adopted a rule governing real estate advertising that requires all real estate advertising be a true and factual representation of the property and real estate services being advertised, and because auctioning or offering for auction the real estate of another for compensation is a real estate service that requires a broker's license, it follows that advertisements regarding the sale of real estate by auction comes under this rule.Necessity of a Real Estate Broker's License to Auction Real Estate(5/24/16), Att'y Gen.

in Subsection A, added a new Paragraph A(4) and redesignated former Paragraphs A(4) through A(16) as Paragraphs A(5) through A(17), respectively; in Subsection B, after the first occurrence of \"Paragraph\", deleted \"(14)\" and added \"(15)\"; and in Subsection C, added Paragraph C(9).\n\nThe 2014 amendment,effective May 21, 2014, added definitions of \"commercial real estate\", \"foreign broker\", and \"nonresident licensee\" to provide for foreign brokers acting as qualifying or associate brokers with respect to commercial real estate; and in Subsection A, added Paragraphs (7), (10) and (13).\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective June 14, 2013, changed the definition of \"associate broker\" and added the definition of \"qualifying broker\";

defendants, who were licensed brokers in New Mexico, assisted plaintiff conduct due diligence in connection with the purchase of the ranch; plaintiff and defendants subsequently agreed that if defendants found a third-party purchaser of the ranch, that plaintiff would not buy the ranch and plaintiff and defendants would share the sales commission; defendants told plaintiff about a possible buyer of the ranch and plaintiff directed defendants to contact the owner of the ranch about the prospective buyer; the ranch was not listed for sale; and the only way defendants knew the ranch was for sale was through their contact with plaintiff, plaintiff was a broker within the meaning of Section 61-29-2 NMSA 1978 because plaintiff was a finder or middleman who brought the ranch owner and the buyer together with the assistance of defendants.PC Carter Co. v. Miller, 2011-NMCA-052, 149 N.M. 660, 253 P.3d 950.\n\nBroker buying or selling property for himself.— The commission lacks jurisdiction over a real estate broker who is buying or selling property for himself, unless he holds himself out as a broker.Vihstadt v. Real Estate Comm'n, 1988-NMSC-003, 106 N.M. 641, 748 P.2d 14.\n\nBurden on broker when acting for himself.— A licensed broker has the burden of showing that there is no possibility of misunderstanding or confusion as to his status when he purports to act for himself.Poorbaugh v. N.M. Real Estate Comm'n, 1978-NMSC-033, 91 N.M. 622, 578 P.2d 323.\n\nHiring of note broker for sale of real estate contract.— Because the seller of a real estate contract, who hired a note broker to handle the sale, was not acting as a real estate broker during the sale, the commission lacked jurisdiction to revoke the seller's license for misrepresentation.Vihstadt v. Real Estate Comm'n, 1988-NMSC-003, 106 N.M. 641, 748 P.2d 14.\n\nWhether landowner made representation as to being real estate broker is factual determinationto be made by the trier of fact.Poorbaugh v. N.M. Real Estate Comm'n, 1978-NMSC-033, 91 N.M. 622, 578 P.2d 323.\n\nFiduciary duties of salesperson extended to broker.— Because a real estate salesperson must work under a broker, when a principal buyer or seller engages a real estate salesperson as an agent, the principal also engages the salesperson's qualifying broker as an agent, thus extending the fiduciary duty owed to the principal buyer or seller up the salesperson's chain of command to the broker. Although agency fiduciary obligations and liabilities may extend from a salesperson to the qualifying broker, the fiduciary duties of one real estate salesperson are not attributable to another salesperson operating under the same qualifying broker unless one salesperson is at fault in appointing, supervising or cooperating with the other.Moser v. Bertram, 1993-NMSC-040, 115 N.M. 766, 858 P.2d 854.\n\nBroker status not changed by power of attorney.— Where a real estate broker entered into a real estate transaction as a broker, he was not exempt from the jurisdiction of the commission under the \"attorney in fact\" exception in Subsection D (now C(4)), even though he was given the power of attorney to enable him to complete the transaction without the owners being present.Elliott v. N.M. Real Estate Comm'n, 1985-NMSC-078, 103 N.M. 273, 705 P.2d 679.\n\nActivities not excepted.— Activities did not fall within exception provided for in Subsection D (now C).Bosque Farms Home Ctr., Inc. v. Tabet Lumber Co., 1988-NMSC-027, 107 N.M. 115, 753 P.2d 894.\n\nNo license required for arranging investments.— Arranging investments in real estate contracts is not a transaction for which a real estate broker's or salesperson's license is required.Garcia v. N.M. Real Estate Comm'n, 1989-NMCA-034, 108 N.M. 591, 775 P.2d 1308, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 624, 776 P.2d 846.\n\nA person who auctions the real estate of another person for compensation is acting as an associate or qualifying broker.— The Real Estate Brokers and Salesmen Act (act), 61-29-1 to 61-29-29 NMSA 1978, specifically lists auctioning or the offer to auction real estate, when performed for another and for compensation, as conduct that brings one within in the definition of associate broker and qualifying broker, and therefore a person who auctions or offers for auction the real estate of another person for compensation is acting as an associate or qualifying broker under the act and must possess a broker's license issued by the New Mexico real estate commission, regardless of whether the auctioneer is hired by the seller or by a licensed broker.Necessity of a Real Estate Broker's License to Auction Real Estate(5/24/16), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2016-05.\n\nRule governing advertisements applies to advertisements of real estate auctions.— The New Mexico real estate commission has adopted a rule governing real estate advertising that requires all real estate advertising be a true and factual representation of the property and real estate services being advertised, and because auctioning or offering for auction the real estate of another for compensation is a real estate service that requires a broker's license, it follows that advertisements regarding the sale of real estate by auction comes under this rule.Necessity of a Real Estate Broker's License to Auction Real Estate(5/24/16), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2016-05.\n\nBroker to supervise salespeople.— This section and Section 61-29-11 NMSA 1978 express a clear legislative mandate that brokers, as the persons principally responsible to the public, actually be in a position to supervise the actions of their salespeople. At the same time, the statutes do not require the broker himself to engage in business full-time. 1980 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 80-22.\n\nThe exemption contained in Subsection D (now C(4)) applies onlyto those persons holding the power of attorney and who are not engaged in business as real estate brokers. 1965 Op.

All real-estate-related activity conducted under such license shall cease for the duration of the license suspension or revocation, and any associate broker licenses hanging with a qualifying broker whose license is suspended or revoked shall be automatically placed on inactive status until a new qualifying broker or a qualifying broker in charge is designated.\n\nD. Every license shall be renewed every three years on or before the last day of the month following the licensee's month of birth. Upon written request for renewal by the licensee, the commission shall certify renewal of a license if there is no reason or condition that might warrant the refusal of the renewal of a license. The licensee shall provide proof of compliance with continuing education requirements and pay the renewal fee. If a licensee has not made application for renewal of license, furnished proof of compliance with continuing education requirements and paid the renewal fee by the license renewal date, the license shall expire.

The revocation of a qualifying broker's license automatically suspends every associate broker's license granted to any person by virtue of association with the qualifying broker whose license has been revoked, pending a change of qualifying broker. Upon the naming of a new qualifying broker, the suspended license shall be reactivated without charge if granted during the three-year renewal cycle.\n\nE. A qualifying broker shall conduct brokerage business under the trade name and from the brokerage address registered with the commission. Every brokerage shall have a qualifying broker in charge. The license of the qualifying broker and each associate broker associated with that qualifying broker shall be prominently displayed in each brokerage office. The address of the office shall be designated in the qualifying broker's license, and a license issued shall not authorize the licensee to transact real estate business at any other address.

Although agency fiduciary obligations and liabilities may extend from a salesperson to the qualifying broker, the fiduciary duties of one real estate salesperson are not attributable to another salesperson operating under the same qualifying broker unless one salesperson is at fault in appointing, supervising or cooperating with the other.Moser v. Bertram, 1993-NMSC-040, 115 N.M. 766, 858 P.2d 854.\n\nBrokers must supervise their salespeople.— Section 61-29-2 NMSA 1978 and this section express a clear legislative mandate that brokers, the persons principally responsible to the public, actually be in a position to supervise the actions of their salespeople. At the same time, the statutes do not require the broker himself to engage in business full-time. 1980 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 80-22.\n\nRelicensing of out-of-state broker returning to state.— An individual who has been licensed as a resident real estate broker in the state of New Mexico, and who has established a residence in another state or country may subsequently return to New Mexico and be relicensed as a real estate broker upon payment of the necessary fee and filing of the required bond and meeting any other needed requirements without applying for and taking a broker's examination as required of applicants who have not previously been licensed as real estate brokers, provided that the real estate board in its discretion desires to waive the examination. 1958 Op.

      "text": "A. In accordance with the Uniform Licensing Act [Chapter 61, Article 1 NMSA 1978], the commission may refuse to issue a license or may suspend, revoke, limit or condition a license if the applicant or licensee has, by false or fraudulent representations, obtained a license or, in performing or attempting to perform any of the actions specified in Chapter 61, Article 29 NMSA 1978, an applicant or licensee has:\n\n(1) made a substantial misrepresentation;\n\n(2) pursued a continued and flagrant course of misrepresentation; made false promises through agents, salespersons, advertising or otherwise; or used any trade name or insignia of membership in any real estate organization of which the licensee is not a member;\n\n(3) paid or received a rebate, profit, compensation or commission to or from any unlicensed person, except the licensee's principal or other party to the transaction, and then only with that principal's written consent;\n\n(4) represented or attempted to represent a qualifying broker other than a qualifying broker with whom the licensee is associated without the express knowledge and consent of that qualifying broker;\n\n(5) failed, within a reasonable time, to account for or to remit any money coming into the licensee's possession that belongs to others, commingled funds of others with the licensee's own or failed to keep funds of others in an escrow or trustee account or failed to furnish legible copies of all listing and sales contracts to all parties executing them;\n\n(6) been convicted in any court of competent jurisdiction of a felony or any offense involving moral turpitude;\n\n(7) employed or compensated, directly or indirectly, a person for performing any of the acts regulated by Chapter 61, Article 29 NMSA 1978 who is not a licensed qualifying broker or an associate broker; provided, however, that a qualifying broker may pay a commission to a qualifying broker of another state as provided in Section 61-29-16.1 NMSA 1978;\n\n(8) failed, if a qualifying broker, to place as soon after receipt as is practicably possible, after securing signatures of all parties to the transaction, any deposit money or other money received by the qualifying broker in a real estate transaction in a custodial, trust or escrow account, maintained by the qualifying broker in a bank or savings and loan institution or title company authorized to do business in this state, in which the funds shall be kept until the transaction is consummated or otherwise terminated, at which time a full accounting of the funds shall be made by the qualifying broker. Records relative to the deposit, maintenance and withdrawal of the funds shall contain information as may be prescribed by the rules of the commission. Nothing in this paragraph prohibits a qualifying broker from depositing nontrust funds in an amount not to exceed the required minimum balance in each trust account so as to meet the minimum balance requirements of the bank necessary to maintain the account and avoid charges. The minimum balance deposit shall not be considered commingling and shall not be subject to levy, attachment or garnishment. This paragraph does not prohibit a qualifying broker from depositing any deposit money or other money received by the qualifying broker in a real estate transaction with another cooperating broker who shall in turn comply with this paragraph;\n\n(9) failed, if an associate broker, to place as soon after receipt as is practicably possible in the custody of the associate broker's qualifying broker, after securing signatures of all parties to the transaction, any deposit money or other money entrusted to the associate broker by any person dealing with the associate broker as the representative of the qualifying broker;\n\n(10) violated a provision of Chapter 61, Article 29 NMSA 1978 or a rule promulgated by the commission;\n\n(11) committed an act, whether of the same or different character from that specified in this subsection, that is related to dealings as a qualifying broker or an associate broker and that constitutes or demonstrates bad faith, incompetency, untrustworthiness, impropriety, fraud, dishonesty, negligence or any unlawful act; or\n\n(12) been the subject of disciplinary action as a licensee while licensed to practice real estate in another jurisdiction, territory or possession of the United States or another country.\n\nB. An unlawful act or violation of Chapter 61, Article 29 NMSA 1978 by an associate broker, employee, partner or associate of a qualifying broker shall not be cause for the revocation of a license of the qualifying broker unless it appears to the satisfaction of the commission that the qualifying broker had guilty knowledge of the unlawful act or violation.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 67-24-29, enacted by Laws 1959, ch. 226, § 11; 1965, ch. 304, § 7; 1981, ch. 22, § 3; 1983, ch. 261, § 5; 1984, ch. 56, § 1; 1987, ch. 90, § 5; 1991, ch. 13, § 1; 2001, ch. 163, § 8; 2005, ch. 35, § 14; 2011, ch. 85, § 6; 2022, ch. 39, § 97.\n\nThe 2022 amendment,effective May 18, 2022, clarified that the New Mexico real estate commission is required to follow the provisions of the Uniform Licensing Act for disciplinary matters; and in Subsection A, added \"In accordance with the Uniform Licensing Act\".\n\nThe 2011 amendment,effective July 1 2011, permitted the payment of a commission to a qualified broker or another state if, pursuant to Section 61-29-16.1 NMSA 1978, the nonresident broker has entered in to a transaction-specific contract with a resident broker and has consented to being sued in New Mexico.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective January 1, 2006, permits the real estate commission to issue license with limitations or conditions if the applicant or licensee has obtained a license by false or fraudulent representations or performed or attempted to perform the prescribed acts specified in this section and provides that an unlawful act or violation of Chapter 61, Article 29 NMSA 1978 by an associate broker is not cause for revocation of a qualifying broker's license unless the qualifying broker had guilty knowledge of the act.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, inserted the Subsection A and B designations and redesignated former Subsections A to K as Paragraphs A(1) to A(11); deleted \"real estate\" preceding \"broker\" throughout the section; in Subsection A, substituted \"refuse to issue or may suspend\" for \"refuse a license for cause or suspend\", and \"an applicant or licensee has:\" for \"is deemed to be guilty of:\" in the introductory language; substituted \"with whom he is associated\" for \"with whom he is licensed\" in Paragraph (4), inserted \"after securing signatures of all parties to the transaction\" in Paragraphs (8) and (9); deleted \"in the interests of the public and in conformance with the provisions of Chapter 61, Article 29 NMSA 1978\" from the end of Paragraph (10); substituted \"committed an act\" for \"any other conduct\" in Paragraph (11); and added Paragraph (12).\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, substituted \"in Chapter 61, Article 29 NMSA 1978\" for \"herein\" in the introductory paragraph; substituted the language beginning with \"unlicensed person\" for \"person other than his principal\" at the end of Subsection C; and made minor stylistic changes in Subsections E and K.\n\nRevocation for \"substantial misrepresentations\".— The commission may suspend a license on the grounds that the licensee misrepresented to prospective buyers both the size of the property in question and the age of the roof.Wolfley v. Real Estate Comm'n, 1983-NMSC-064, 100 N.M. 187, 668 P.2d 303.\n\nIf the subjects of misrepresentations on application forms are material, i.e., \"substantial misrepresentations\", the real estate commission can, absent intervening equities, revoke the license even though there is no actual or intentional fraud.Padilla v. Real Estate Comm'n, 1987-NMSC-056, 106 N.M. 96, 739 P.2d 965.\n\nThe test of whether a misrepresentation is substantial is if it operates as an inducement to the real estate commission to do that which it should not otherwise have done.Padilla v. Real Estate Comm'n, 1987-NMSC-056, 106 N.M. 96, 739 P.2d 965.\n\nWhere a license to sell real estate was revoked for false or fraudulent representations in applications with respect to unpaid liens or judgments, but the real estate commission's findings and conclusions did not resolve in any meaningful way whether licensee intended to deceive and to induce the commission to act in reliance upon a misrepresentation of fact known by him to be untrue, and there were no specific findings and conclusions by the commission to afford the supreme court a clear understanding that the decision was based upon false representations relevant and material to facts bearing upon the good repute and competence of the licensee in the public interest, the cause was remanded to the commission with express directions to enter proper findings of fact and conclusions of law, together with a final order.Padilla v. Real Estate Comm'n, 1987-NMSC-056, 106 N.M. 96, 739 P.2d 965.\n\nSubstantial evidence to support commission's suspension of broker's license based on Paragraph A(5).Elliott v. N.M. Real Estate Comm'n, 1985-NMSC-078, 103 N.M. 273, 705 P.2d 679.\n\nBroker to have knowledge of building code and zoning ordinances.— It is incumbent upon the broker to have a general knowledge of the building code and the zoning ordinances which deal with the particular property being offered for sale or which is being purchased.Amato v. Rathbun Realty, Inc., 1982-NMCA-095, 98 N.M. 231, 647 P.2d 433.\n\nNonresident broker may share in commission.— This section modifies Sections 61-29-1 and 61-29-16 NMSA 1978 to the extent that a nonresident broker may, in a limited situation, share in a commission. He may only do so, however, through cooperation with a New Mexico licensed broker.Hayes v. Reeves, 1977-NMSC-092, 91 N.M. 174, 571 P.2d 1177.\n\nGenerally, as to establishing custodial, trust or escrow accounts.— No regulation of the real estate commission requires a custodial, trust or escrow account prior to the receipt of funds appropriate for deposit in such account.McCaughtry v. N.M. Real Estate Comm'n, 1970-NMSC-143, 82 N.M. 116, 477 P.2d 292.\n\nJurisdiction where landowner claims acting as broker.— Under Section 61-29-2 NMSA 1978 if a landowner represents to either the buyer or seller that he is acting as a broker, the real estate commission has jurisdiction over the transaction.Poorbaugh v. N.M. Real Estate Comm'n, 1978-NMSC-033, 91 N.M. 622, 578 P.2d 323.\n\nHiring of note broker for sale of real estate contract.— Because the seller of a real estate contract, who hired a note broker to handle the sale, was not acting as a real estate broker during the sale, the commission lacked jurisdiction to revoke the seller's license for misrepresentation.Vihstadt v. Real Estate Comm'n, 1988-NMSC-003, 106 N.M. 641, 748 P.2d 14.\n\nApplicability of Paragraph A(3) prohibition.— The prohibition of Subsection C (now Paragraph A(3)) is applicable to a broker or salesman representing the seller of real estate giving the purchaser trading stamps, free down payments on the property, moving costs, etc., when it can be shown that the real estate broker or salesman gave one or more of the items listed to the purchaser of the property as an integral part of a transaction involving the purchase and sale of the property. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-28 (rendered prior to 1991 amendment).\n\nPayment of commission to buyer who is not principal prohibited.— Subsection C (now Paragraph A(3)) precludes a licensed salesman or broker from paying any portion of his commission to a buyer who is not his principal, regardless of disclosure to the principal of the arrangement. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-25 (rendered prior to 1991 amendment).\n\nIn order to properly make sense of the reference in Subsection C (now Paragraph A(3)) to \"paying,\" and to give effect to the legislative intent indicated by that reference, the words \"to or\" may be read into that subsection preceding \"from any person.\" 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-25 (rendered prior to 1991 amendment).\n\nCriminal Offender Employment Act to be followed in suspension or revocation action.— The provisions of the Criminal Offender Employment Act must be followed by the real estate commission in any action by the commission to suspend or revoke a broker's or salesperson's license because of a conviction of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-02.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \" 'To Purify the Bar': A Constitutional Approach to Non-Professional Misconduct,\" see 5 Nat. Res.

To rule otherwise would be to violate the clear intent of the legislature in requiring that real estate \"brokers\" or salespersons be licensed.Watts v. Andrews, 1982-NMSC-080, 98 N.M. 404, 649 P.2d 472.\n\nTexas broker barred from collecting a commission.— Where plaintiff, who was a licensed real estate broker in Texas, knew that an unlisted ranch was for sale; plaintiff and defendants, who were licensed real estate brokers in New Mexico, orally agreed to work together as co-brokers in the sale of the ranch and to share the commission on the purchase price; plaintiff and defendants never entered into a transaction-specific written agreement to share the commission; and plaintiff brought the sellers and the buyers together with the assistance of defendants, plaintiff was barred from collecting a real estate commission, because plaintiff was acting as a broker without a valid New Mexico broker's license or a written, foreign broker's agreement in violation of Section 61-29-16 NMSA 1978.PC Carter Co. v. Miller, 2011-NMCA-052, 149 N.M. 660, 253 P.3d 950.\n\nMeaning of \"arose\".— The word \"arose\" used in this statute is used in its usual and ordinary meaning and denotes past completed action, not past continuing action.Lakeview Invs., Inc. v.

Alamo Hotels, Inc., 1963-NMSC-091, 72 N.M. 227, 382 P.2d 707,overruled byStar Realty Co. v. Sellers, 1963-NMSC-140, 73 N.M. 207, 387 P.2d 319.\n\nFinding that plaintiff held license required.— A judgment for recovery of a real estate commission without a finding that the plaintiff held either a broker's or salesman's license when the cause of action arose is erroneous.Watts v. Andrews, 1982-NMSC-080, 98 N.M. 404, 649 P.2d 472.\n\nSection did not apply where plaintiff was not acting as a real estate broker.— A judgment for recovery of a real estate commission without a finding that the plaintiff held either a broker's or salesman's license when the cause of action arose is erroneous, but if the real estate commission is not derived from the sale of real property, or if the person was not acting as a real estate broker, then this provision does not apply, and therefore where plaintiff, a business consulting company, brought an action against the owner of property for breach of contract, fraudulent inducement and unjust enrichment based on services plaintiff rendered in the sale of property and in the sale of water from the property, summary judgment for the property owner was not warranted, because plaintiff had no role in the negotiations, did not introduce the buyers to the sellers, and had no first-hand knowledge of the deal's details. Plaintiff was therefore not acting as a real estate broker during the sale of the property or during the water sale negotiations.Tyler Group Partners, LLC v. Madera, 543 F. Supp. 3d 1184 (D. N.M. 2021).\n\nSection prohibits action in quantum meruit to recover value of servicesrendered by person who is required to have license, in the absence of such license.Bank of N.M. v.

Andrews, 1982-NMSC-080, 98 N.M. 404, 649 P.2d 472.\n\nSuit by corporation.— Since an action to recover a real estate commission may only be brought in the name of the licensed broker, evidence showing corporation may be entitled to a license, and that an officer thereof had a license, was insufficient to enable corporation to bring suit in its own name.Star Realty Co. v. Sellers, 1963-NMSC-140, 73 N.M. 207, 387 P.2d 319.\n\nAction for breach of contract.— This section did not prevent real estate broker from maintaining action for breach of contract where broker was not licensed at time he entered into exclusive sales representation agreement with defendant but became licensed prior to breach of this agreement by defendant.Lakeview Invs., Inc. v.
