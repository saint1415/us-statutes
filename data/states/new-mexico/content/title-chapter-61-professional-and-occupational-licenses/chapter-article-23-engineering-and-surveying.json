In order to safeguard life, health and property and to promote the public welfare, any person in either public or private capacity practicing or offering to practice engineering or surveying shall be required to submit evidence that the person is qualified to so practice and shall be licensed as provided in the Engineering and Surveying Practice Act. It is unlawful for any person to practice, offer to practice, engage in the business, act in the capacity of, advertise or use in connection with the person's name or otherwise assume, use or advertise any title or description tending to convey the impression that the person is a professional, licensed engineer or surveyor unless that person is licensed or exempt under the provisions of the Engineering and Surveying Practice Act.

Determination of exclusive practice of engineering or surveying requires an affirmative vote by no less than three members of the joint committee. If an affirmative vote of three members cannot be achieved, the determination of exclusivity shall be made by the full board.\n\nF. To effect the provisions of the Engineering and Surveying Practice Act, the board may, under the chair's hand and the board's seal, subpoena witnesses and compel the production of books, papers and documents in any disciplinary action conducted in accordance with the Uniform Licensing Act [Chapter 61, Article 1 NMSA 1978] against a licensee or a person practicing or offering to practice without licensure. Any member of the board may administer oaths or affirmations to witnesses appearing before the board. If a person refuses to obey a subpoena so issued or refuses to testify or produce any books, papers or documents, the board may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an order to compel the requisite action. If a person willfully fails to comply with such an order, that person may be held in contempt of court.\n\nG.
