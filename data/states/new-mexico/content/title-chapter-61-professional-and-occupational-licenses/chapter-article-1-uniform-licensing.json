      "text": "Chapter 61, Article 1 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Uniform Licensing Act\".\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 67-26-1, enacted by Laws 1957, ch. 247, § 1; 1971, ch. 54, § 1; 2021 (1st S.S.), ch. 3, § 7.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 2002, ch. 83, §§ 2 to 4 purported to enact new sections under the Uniform Licensing Act, but those sections were relocated to appear following the State Civil Emergency Preparedness Act, which is compiled as 12-10-1 to 12-10-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nCross references.— For State Rules Act,see14-4-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor criminal offender employment,see28-2-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the Parental Responsibility Act,see40-5A-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nThe 2021(1st S.S.)amendment,effective June 29, 2021, changed \"Sections 67-26-1 through 67-26-31 NMSA 1953\" to \"Chapter 61, Article 1 NMSA 1978\".\n\nDue process.— A regulation of the New Mexico board of psychologist examiners requiring an oral examination for reinstatement of a retiree's license was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose; however, the examination might not comply with due process, and, thus, an applicant for reinstatement was entitled to a hearing on the rational justification for the oral examination requirement.Mills v. N.M. State Bd. of Psychologist Exam'rs, 1997-NMSC-028, 123 N.M. 421, 941 P.2d 502.\n\nAppeals.— Because the Uniform Licensing Act did not provide a retired psychologist with a basis for appealing a decision of the New Mexico board of psychologist examiners to require an oral examination for reinstatement of her license, she could request a writ of certiorari to obtain review of the board's alleged due process violations.Mills v. N.M. State Bd. of Psychologist Exam'rs, 1997-NMSC-028, 123 N.M. 421, 941 P.2d 502.\n\nRevocation must be based on substantial evidence.— In administrative adjudications where a person's livelihood (a property right) is at stake, any action depriving a person of that property must be based upon such substantial evidence as would support a verdict in a court of law.Young v. Board of Pharmacy, 1969-NMSC-168, 81 N.M. 5, 462 P.2d 139.\n\nNaked hearsay insufficient.— In proceedings to revoke a license to conduct a business or profession, where, by law, the licensee is entitled to a hearing before the licensing authority, revocation based solely upon hearsay evidence is unwarranted.Young v. Board of Pharmacy, 1969-NMSC-168, 81 N.M. 5, 462 P.2d 139.\n\nLicense not revocable on grounds for original denial.— An administrative agency, having once issued a license to an applicant who has made full disclosure of all pertinent facts, may not revoke that same license for reasons that would not have permitted issuance of the license in the first instance.Roberts v. State Bd. of Embalmers & Funeral Dirs., 1967-NMSC-257, 78 N.M. 536, 434 P.2d 61.\n\nBarring fraud and misrepresentation and the existence of statutory authority, state may not revoke the license issued previously to party for the reason that party did not have two years of college training required by the statute when, in fact, at the time appellant granted the license to party, state knew that appellee did not have said college work but, nevertheless, proceeded to grant the license under a policy which, in effect, eliminated the college requirement.Roberts v. State Bd. of Embalmers & Funeral Dirs., 1967-NMSC-257, 78 N.M. 536, 434 P.2d 61.\n\nSpecification of \"unprofessional conduct\" not required.— A board may suspend or revoke a license to practice a profession for \"unprofessional conduct\" without its being required to first specify by regulation or rule exactly what acts may be so considered.Young v. Board of Pharmacy, 1969-NMSC-168, 81 N.M. 5, 462 P.2d 139.\n\nPreexisting account not required to receive funds.— No law or regulation of the New Mexico real estate commission requires a custodial, trust or escrow account prior to the receipt of funds appropriate for deposit in such account.McCaughtry v. N.M. Real Estate Comm'n, 1970-NMSC-143, 82 N.M. 116, 477 P.2d 292.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Police Power and the Design of Buildings,\" see 5 Nat. Res.

Manufactured Hous. Comm., 2003-NMCA-134, 134 N.M. 533, 80 P.3d 470.\n\nA constitutional due process analysis under this section must consider and balance three factors: (1) the private interest affected, (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the interest with the procedures used, and (3) the government's interest, including the fiscal and administrative burdens of providing additional procedures.Rex, Inc. v. Manufactured Hous. Comm., 2003-NMCA-134, 134 N.M. 533, 80 P.3d 470.\n\nDue process requirements were satisfied where the notice of contemplated action cited the statute and the rules the committee relied upon in contemplating the attachment of the consumer bond, contained information about the actual bond, and outlined the general nature of the evidence, and where the licensee had a full and fair opportunity to be heard on the issue of whether collateral estoppel applied on the issues of misrepresentation and loss by the consumers.Rex, Inc. v. Manufactured Hous. Comm., 2003-NMCA-134, 134 N.M. 533, 80 P.3d 470.\n\nProbable cause hearing not necessary before revocation proceedings.— A licensee is not deprived of any due process rights when no probable cause hearing is conducted prior to the institution of license revocation proceedings.Keney v. Derbyshire, 718 F.2d 352 (10th Cir. 1983).\n\nCharging board not disqualified in hearing on charge.— The board of medical examiners has exclusive jurisdiction of the granting and revoking of certificates admitting physicians and surgeons to practice and, in view of the absence of a provision for disqualification of board members, proceedings before the board may not be restrained merely by reason of the fact that the board itself initiated the proceedings against a physician and was, therefore, an interested party.Seidenberg v. N.M. Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 1969-NMSC-028, 80 N.M. 135, 452 P.2d 469.\n\nZeal in performing public duty does not disqualify.Seidenberg v. N.M. Bd. of Med.

Additionally, Subsection L grants the board authority to impose fines of the same amounts upon non-pharmacist registrants and licensees over whom the board has the power to impose other forms of discipline including license or registration revocation and suspension. As to persons over whom the board lacks such disciplinary powers under the Pharmacy Act, the Uniform Licensing Act does not grant the power to impose fines. 1995 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 95-01.\n\nAm.

An action that would have any of the effects specified in Subsections D through N of Section 61-1-3 NMSA 1978 or an action related to unlicensed activity shall not be initiated by a board later than two years after the discovery by the board of the conduct that would be the basis for the action, except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law. Discovery by the board is considered the date on which a complaint or other information that would reasonably connect the allegations to the person was received by a board or board staff.\n\nB. The time limitation contained in Subsection A of this section shall be tolled by any civil or criminal litigation in which the licensee or applicant is a party arising from substantially the same facts, conduct or transactions that would be the basis for the board's action.\n\nC. The New Mexico state board of psychologist examiners shall not initiate an action that would result in any of the actions specified in Subsections D through N of Section 61-1-3 NMSA 1978 later than five years after the conduct of the psychologist or psychologist associate that is the basis for the action. However, if the conduct that is the basis for the action involves a minor or a person adjudicated incompetent, the action shall be initiated, in the case of a minor, no later than one year after the minor's eighteenth birthday or five years after the conduct, whichever is last and, in the case of a person adjudicated incompetent, one year after the adjudication of incompetence is terminated or five years after the conduct, whichever is last.\n\nD.

The section is set out as amended by Laws 1993, ch. 295, § 4.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective May 20, 1992, substituted \"Subsections C and D\" for \"Subsection C\" in Subsection A, added Subsection D and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective June 16, 1989, in Subsection A, substituted \"Subsection D\" for \"Subsections D\" and added \"except as provided in Subsection C of this section\"; in Subsection B deleted \", transaction\" following \"conduct\"; and added Subsection C.\n\nWhen limitation period began to run under the 1993 version of the statute.— The 1993 version of the two-year limitations began to run when the licensing board discovered the conduct giving rise to a disciplinary action against a licensee, not when someone else, such as a complaining party, discovered the conduct.N.M. Real Estate Comm'n v. Barger, 2012-NMCA-081, 284 P.3d 1112.\n\nWhere a complaint was filed with the New Mexico real estate commission in October 2008 against the licensed real estate broker which alleged that the broker was guilty of ethical violations in connection with a real estate contract executed by a seller of real estate and the broker as buyer; the commission investigated the matter and, in May 2010, filed a notice of contemplated action against the broker threatening to revoke the broker's license; the notice of contemplated action was filed more than two years after the complaining party discovered the broker's alleged unethical conduct, but less than two years after the commission discovered the conduct; the 1993 version of the statute did not specify whose discovery of unethical conduct triggered the limitations period; and the 2003 amendment specified that discovery of the unethical conduct by the commission triggered the limitations period, the limitations period began to run under the 1993 version of the statute when the commission discovered the broker's conduct, not when the complaining party discovered the conduct.N.M. Real Estate Comm'n v. Barger, 2012-NMCA-081, 284 P.3d 1112.\n\nDisciplinary action may not be taken against a party later than two years after the improper conduct is discovered by the board.— Where the New Mexico real estate commission (NMREC) issued a notice of contemplated action indicating formal action against petitioners for the revocation of their real estate licenses two years and six days after NMREC received notice from the New Mexico attorney general's office regarding a complaint from a homeowner alleging that petitioners made false statements regarding their business relationship with the homeowner and acted in bad faith regarding negotiations for the short sale of the homeowner's home, the disciplinary action was time-barred by the statute of limitations. A licensing board, subject to the Uniform Licensing Act, §§ 61-1-1 through 61-1-37 NMSA 1978, cannot take disciplinary action against a party later than two years after the improper conduct is discovered by the board.Trubow v. N.M. Real Est. Comm'n, 2022-NMCA-044, cert. granted.\n\nWhen limitation period begins to run.— The limitation period of this section begins to run from the date of the licensee's culpable conduct. Varoz v. N.M. Bd. of Podiatry, 1986-NMSC-051, 104 N.M. 454, 722 P.2d 1176.\n\nCriminal prosecution tolls statute.— The criminal prosecution of culpable conduct serves only to toll the statute if litigation is commenced during the two-year period following the criminal act.Varoz v. N.M. Bd. of Podiatry, 1986-NMSC-051, 104 N.M. 454, 722 P.2d 1176.\n\nIf tolling applies, the limitation period is tolled from the time of indictment or information until the judgment of conviction has been entered, but no longer.Varoz v. N.M. Bd. of Podiatry, 1986-NMSC-051, 104 N.M. 454, 722 P.2d 1176.\n\nConviction is not \"conduct\".— Although the fact of conviction may provide a separate and independent basis for revoking a professional license, a conviction is not \"conduct\" within the meaning of this section and, therefore, the two-year limitation period begins to run from the time of the conduct, transaction or occurrence that underlies the conviction rather than from the date of conviction.Varoz v.

Bd. of Veterinary Med. v. Riegger, 2007-NMSC-044, 142 N.M. 248, 164 P.3d 949.\n\nAssessable costs.— Transcription costs, and if the board is the prevailing party, the costs of at least one expert witness, are assessable to a disciplined licensee.N.M. Bd. of Veterinary Med. v. Riegger, 2007-NMSC-044, 142 N.M. 248, 164 P.3d 949.\n\nNon-assessable costs.— The hearing officer's costs, the cost of a hearing room and board member's per diem and mileage costs are not assessable to a disciplined licensee.N.M. Bd. of Veterinary Med. v. Riegger, 2007-NMSC-044, 142 N.M. 248, 164 P.3d 949.\n\nProbable cause hearing not necessary before revocation proceedings.— A licensee is not deprived of any due process rights when no probable cause hearing is conducted prior to the institution of license revocation proceedings.Keney v. Derbyshire, 718 F.2d 352 (10th Cir. 1983).\n\nCharging board not disqualified in hearing on charge.— The board of medical examiners has exclusive jurisdiction regarding the granting and revoking of certificates admitting physicians and surgeons to practice and, in view of the fact that the statutes do not provide for disqualification of board members, proceedings before the board may not be restrained merely by reason of the fact that the board itself initiated the proceedings against a physician and was, therefore, an interested party.Seidenberg v. N.M. Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 1969-NMSC-028, 80 N.M. 135, 452 P.2d 469.\n\nZeal in performing public duty does not disqualify.Seidenberg v. N.M. Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 1969-NMSC-028, 80 N.M. 135, 452 P.2d 469.\n\nContent of notice.— The \"evidence\" to be set out in the notice of contemplated action under this statute is the evidence of the ground or grounds to be relied upon in taking the contemplated action under former Section 61-5-14 NMSA 1978, not the evidence to be adduced by way of explanation and determination of rehabilitation under the Criminal Offender Employment Act, Section 28-2-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.Weiss v. N.M. Bd. of Dentistry, 1990-NMSC-077, 110 N.M. 574, 798 P.2d 175.\n\nNotice of contemplated action sufficient.— The notice of contemplated action in this case was sufficient to provide the licensee with notice, even though it did not state that the qualifying party certificate was in jeopardy; the licensee knew the general nature of the proceedings against him and that is all that notice pleading requires. Further, the licensee waived the lack of notice issue by appearing at the administrative hearing and defending on the merits.Oden v. State Regulation & Licensing Dep't, 1996-NMSC-022, 121 N.M. 670, 916 P.2d 1337.\n\nPsychologist was afforded adequate notice that she might be questioned regarding what means she had used to assess her former patient's needs and potential for exploitation; the relevant board rules, which were quoted in the notice of contemplated action, provided that personal relationships with former clients could only be entered with \"caution and deliberateness\", which should be reflected by the psychologist considering issues such as the need for future treatment and the potential for exploitation of the client.N.M. State Bd. of Psychologist Exam'rs v. Land, 2003-NMCA-034, 62 N.M. 1244, 62 P.3d 1244, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 413, 63 P.3d 516.\n\nThe notice of contemplated action was adequate where it cited the statute and the rules the committee relied upon in contemplating the attachment of the consumer bond, contained information about the actual bond, and outlined the general nature of the evidence.Rex, Inc. v. Manufactured Hous. Comm., 2003-NMCA-134, 134 N.M. 533, 80 P.3d 470.\n\nThe manufacturer was not prejudiced by the omission of the right to subpoena witnesses in the notice of contemplated action because the hearing was based upon the judgment and findings of the district court in an Unfair Practices Act action, and the manufacturer did not have the right to relitigate them.Rex, Inc. v. Manufactured Hous. Comm., 2003-NMCA-134, 134 N.M. 533, 80 P.3d 470.\n\nRule 1-054 NMRAdoes not govern the award of costs in an administrative disciplinary action under the Uniform Licensing Act. N.M. Bd. of Veterinary Med. v. Riegger, 2006-NMCA-069, 139 N.M. 679, 137 P.3d 619,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2007-NMSC-044, 142 N.M. 248, 164 P.3d 947.\n\nAssessment of cost of stenographic recordto licensee in disciplinary hearing was not arbitrary or capricious because employing a stenographer, rather than tape recording the proceedings, was a permissible and logical choice.N.M. Bd. of Veterinary Med. v. Riegger, 2006-NMCA-069, 139 N.M. 679, 137 P.3d 619,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2007-NMSC-044, 142 N.M. 248, 164 P.3d 947.\n\nAssessment of board members' per diem and mileagecosts to licensee in disciplinary hearing was proper.N.M. Bd. of Veterinary Med. v. Riegger, 2006-NMCA-069, 139 N.M. 679, 137 P.3d 619,aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2007-NMSC-044, 142 N.M. 248, 164 P.3d 947.\n\nRequirement of actual notice to licensee.— The Uniform Licensing Act requires actual notice to be given to an individual who may lose a license, pursuant to the hearing requirements contained in the law. In that case, a public policy-making body which convenes a hearing on a licensing matter and which is subject to the provisions of the act must follow the act's specific notice tenets. In these cases, mere posting of such notice is insufficient as it affects the individual licensee. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-29.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 51 Am.

N.M. Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 1969-NMSC-028, 80 N.M. 135, 452 P.2d 469.\n\nZeal in performing public duty does not disqualify.Seidenberg v. N.M. Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 1969-NMSC-028, 80 N.M. 135, 452 P.2d 469.\n\nDue process violated where hearing conducted by prejudiced tribunal.— Any utilization of this section which has the effect of allowing an administrative hearing, punitive in nature, to be conducted by a patently prejudiced tribunal must necessarily violate the due process provisions of the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the United States constitution and N.M. Const., art. II, § 18.Reid v. N.M. Bd. of Exam'rs in Optometry, 1979-NMSC-005, 92 N.M. 414, 589 P.2d 198.\n\nOne peremptory disqualification allowed.— Interpretation of this section by the manufactured homes committee to allow only one peremptory disqualification of a committee member at a hearing was correct.Rex, Inc. v. Manufactured Hous. Comm., 1995-NMSC-023, 119 N.M. 500, 892 P.2d 947.\n\nPeremptory excusals must be exercised prior to the first of sequential hearings in a disciplinary action.— Where, following the receipt of five patient complaints regarding petitioner, the New Mexico medical board (board) initiated two disciplinary actions against petitioner, each based on the complaints filed against him, a notice of summary suspension and a notice of contemplated action, both of which were assigned the same case number, and where petitioner requested hearings as to each notice, and where, following the summary suspension hearing, the hearing officer issued proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law recommending suspension of petitioner's medical license, and where the board adopted the hearing officer's recommendation of suspension, and where a second hearing was scheduled on the notice of contemplated action before the same hearing officer who presided over the summary suspension hearing, and where petitioner filed a motion for change of hearing officer, in which he stated that he was electing to exercise his right to a peremptory excusal of the assigned hearing officer, and where the hearing officer filed an order denying petitioner's motion on the basis that the peremptory excusal was not timely, stating that a peremptory excusal was not available to petitioner because NMSA 1978, § 61-1-7(C), provides for peremptory excusal at least twenty days prior to the first hearing, and where the board affirmed the hearing officer's order denying petitioner's motion for change of hearing officer, and where the contemplated action hearing was held as scheduled, resulting in the hearing officer's report recommending that petitioner's license be revoked, and where the board adopted the hearing officer's findings and ultimately issued its decision and order revoking petitioner's license, the board did not err in affirming the hearing officer's order denying petitioner's motion for change of hearing officer, because in light of the facts of the case and the plain language of the statute, the board's interpretation of § 61-1-7(C), that peremptory excusals must be exercised prior to the first of a series of hearings since the notices and hearings, together, constituted the disciplinary action against petitioner, was reasonable and representative of the obvious spirit of the statute.Rauth v.

In proceedings held under the Uniform Licensing Act, boards and hearing officers may admit any evidence and may give probative effect to evidence that is of a kind commonly relied on by reasonably prudent people in the conduct of serious affairs. Boards and hearing officers may in their discretion exclude incompetent, irrelevant, immaterial and unduly repetitious evidence. In proceedings involving the suspension or revocation of a license, rules of privilege shall be applicable to the same extent as in proceedings before the courts of this state. Documentary evidence may be received in the form of copies or excerpts.\n\nB. Boards and hearing officers may take notice of judicially cognizable facts and in addition may take notice of general, technical or scientific facts within their specialized knowledge. When any board or hearing officer takes notice of a fact, the applicant or licensee shall be notified either before or during the hearing of the fact so noticed and its source and shall be afforded an opportunity to contest the fact so noticed.\n\nC. Boards and hearing officers may utilize their experience, technical competence and specialized knowledge in the evaluation of evidence presented to them.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 67-26-11, enacted by Laws 1957, ch. 247, § 11; 1981, ch. 349, § 10.\n\nReliable evidence given probative effect.— Evidence of a kind commonly relied on by reasonably prudent men in the conduct of serious affairs may be given probative effect under this section.Young v. Board of Pharmacy, 1969-NMSC-168, 81 N.M. 5, 462 P.2d 139.\n\nNecessity of expert testimony.— Expert testimony is not required to establish negligence or a failure to comply with the standards of professional conduct. A board is required to rely on substantial evidence in reaching its decision; while the court will defer to the board's expert interpretation of evidence, the court will not allow the board to take disciplinary action without substantial evidence in the record to justify the application of the board's expertise.Gonzales v. N.M. Bd. of Chiropractic Exam'rs, 1998-NMSC-021, 125 N.M. 418, 962 P.2d 1253.\n\nExpert testimony was not required to support charges that a dentist submitted a false claim for reimbursement and that the dentist was guilty of unprofessional conduct and failed to practice dentistry in a professionally competent manner. Where the agency conducting the hearing is itself composed of experts qualified to make a judgment as to the licensee's adherence to standards of professional conduct, there is no need for the kind of assistance an expert provides in the form of an opinion.Weiss v. N.M. Bd. of Dentistry, 1990-NMSC-077, 110 N.M. 574, 798 P.2d 175.\n\nHearsay admissible.— This section clearly contemplates that a board may admit and consider hearsay evidence, if it is of a kind commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent men in the conduct of serious affairs.In re Willoughby, 1971-NMSC-040, 82 N.M. 443, 483 P.2d 498.\n\nReference to indictment.— Because an agency has wide discretion in receiving and excluding evidence in proceedings under the Uniform Licensing Act, any error in allowing reference to an indictment against a dentist was harmless.Weiss v. N.M. Bd. of Dentistry, 1990-NMSC-077110 N.M. 574, 798 P.2d 175.\n\nStandard of proof applied in administrative proceedings,with few exceptions, is a preponderance of the evidence.Foster v. Bd. of Dentistry, 1986-NMSC-009, 103 N.M. 776, 714 P.2d 580.\n\nSubstantial evidence must support revocation.— The revocation or suspension of a license to conduct a business or profession must not be based solely upon hearsay evidence, as other legally competent evidence, together with the hearsay evidence, must substantially support the findings upon which the revocation or suspension is based.In re Willoughby, 1971-NMSC-040, 82 N.M. 443, 483 P.2d 498.\n\nHigher burden to prove fraud.— If fraud is charged in an administrative proceeding, the evidence in support of a finding of fraud is not deemed substantial \"if it is not clear, strong and convincing.\"Seidenberg v.

Bd. of Dental Health Care v. Jaime, 2013-NMCA-040, 296 P.3d 1261.\n\nEffect of failure to timely sign decision.— Failure of the board of dentistry to render and sign its decision suspending a dentist's license within 90 days after completion of the hearing made the decision null and void.Foster v. Board of Dentistry, 1986-NMSC-009, 103 N.M. 776, 714 P.2d 580.\n\nThe 90-day time limit imposed by this section is expressly jurisdictional.
