      "text": "A. The legislature finds that the mapping of the human genome continues to result in the rapid expansion of genetic knowledge and a proliferation of testing for genetic conditions. This has created a need for qualified professional genetic counselors to coordinate assessments, to deliver accurate information to families, to assist families in adjusting to the implications of their diagnoses and to help ensure that genetic information is used appropriately in the delivery of medical care.\n\nB. The purpose of the Genetic Counseling Act is to protect the public from the unprofessional, improper, incompetent and unlawful practice of genetic counseling.\n\nHistory:Laws 2008, ch. 53, § 2.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2008, ch. 53 § 14 made the Genetic Counseling Act effective July 1, 2009.",
