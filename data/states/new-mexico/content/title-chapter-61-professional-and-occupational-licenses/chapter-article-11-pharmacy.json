      "text": "A. The legislature finds that the practice of pharmacy in New Mexico is a professional practice affecting the public health, safety and welfare and is subject to regulation and control in the public interest. The legislature finds further that it is a matter of public interest and concern that the practice of pharmacy as defined in the Pharmacy Act merit and receive the confidence of the public, and that only qualified persons be permitted to engage in the practice of pharmacy so that the quality of drugs and related devices distributed in New Mexico is ensured.\n\nB. The purpose of the Pharmacy Act is to promote, preserve and protect the public health, safety and welfare by and through the effective control and regulation of the practice of pharmacy, including the licensure of pharmacists and pharmacist interns and registration of pharmacy technicians; the licensure, control and regulation of all sites or persons, in or out of state, who distribute, manufacture or sell drugs or devices used in the dispensing and administration of drugs in New Mexico; and the regulation and control of such other materials as may be used in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of injury, illness or disease of a patient or other person.\n\nHistory:Laws 1997, ch. 131, § 2.\n\nStandard of care required of retail pharmacists in filling prescriptions for controlled substances.— Where the personal representative of decedent's estate brought a lawsuit, asserting claims of negligence and negligence per se, against the pharmacy that dispensed certain Schedule II drugs to decedent, who died from an overdose of physician-prescribed medications, the district court erred in granting the pharmacy's motion for summary judgment, because the pharmacy's motion did not establish a prima facie case of entitlement to judgment as a matter of law as to the standard of care or the pharmacy's compliance with the standard, and even if the pharmacy had met that burden, plaintiff's expert affidavit sufficed to establish a genuine dispute of material fact concerning these material issues, and dismissal of the pharmacy from the case was improper because the motion did not demonstrate the pharmacy's entitlement to summary judgment on the separate claim of negligence per se.Oakey v. May Maple Pharmacy, Inc., 2017-NMCA-054, cert. denied.",

added a new Subsection GG and redesignated former Subsection EE as Subsection HH; and in Subsection HH, after \"including\", deleted \"manufacturers, repackers\".\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, inserted \"the administering or prescribing of dangerous drug therapy\" in Subsection BB.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, added Subsection G(3).\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective June 20, 1997, rewrote this section to the extent that a detailed comparison is impracticable.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective May 20, 1992, added all of the present language of Subsection C following \"dosage form\";

defendant had a pharmacy consultant agreement with the nursing home in which defendant agreed to be responsible for the general supervision of the pharmaceutical products and pharmacy services provided by the nursing home and a pharmacy services agreement to purchase pharmacy products and services for the nursing home; both agreements expressly provided that the agreements did not confer any benefits on third parties and that a failure to perform by defendant created imminent jeopardy to patient safety; the nursing home did not notify defendant of the change in the decedent's prescription; the decedent was not a third-party beneficiary of the agreements between defendant and the nursing home; and defendant had no duty to control the nurse or to monitor patients outside a monthly review which defendant had conducted prior to the change in the decedent's prescription, defendant was not liable to the decedent for breach of contract or for negligence.Thompson v. Potter, 2012-NMCA-014, 268 P.3d 57.\n\nDefendants did not meet the definition of \"custodial care facilities,\" and therefore did not require a pharmacy license.— Where the board of pharmacy notified defendants, two community care homes that provide full-time care, supervision and support to children, that they needed a pharmacy license to maintain their children, youth and families department (CYFD) licenses, claiming that defendants were considered \"custodial care facilities\" under the Pharmacy Act, §§ 61-11-1 through 61-11-29 NMSA 1978, and where defendants responded that they were not required to hold a pharmacy license because they were not \"custodial care facilities,\" and where defendants filed a complaint in district court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent their licenses from being revoked, the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting declaratory and injunctive relief in defendants' favor, because defendants did not meet the definition of \"custodial care facilities.\" Defendants' purpose is to provide safe care for certain children, not medical or health care, and the children which defendants care for are not placed there for health care purposes; defendants do not retain nurses or doctors on staff, and do not provide the children with extended health care or prescribe them medications. Defendants are not \"custodial care facilities\" as contemplated by the Pharmacy Act, but are \"community homes,\" as defined by CYFD regulations, which are not required to obtain a pharmacy license to operate.N.M. Boys & Girls Ranch v. N.M. Bd. of Pharmacy, 2022-NMCA-047, cert. denied.\n\nPharmacy board exceeded its regulatory authority by expanding the statutory definition of \"custodial care facility\".— Where the board of pharmacy (board) notified defendants, two community care homes that provide full-time care, supervision and support to children, that they needed a pharmacy license to maintain their children, youth and families department licenses, claiming that defendants were considered \"custodial care facilities\" under the Pharmacy Act, §§ 61-11-1 through 61-11-29 NMSA 1978, and where defendants responded that they were not required to hold a pharmacy license because they were not \"custodial care facilities,\" and where defendants filed a complaint in district court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent their licenses from being revoked, the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting declaratory and injunctive relief in defendants' favor, because the board acted outside its statutory authority in defining \"custodial care facility\" by regulation in a manner that excessively expanded upon the legislature's definition of \"custodial care facility\" in the Pharmacy Act. The board's definition is therefore void.N.M. Boys & Girls Ranch v. N.M. Bd. of Pharmacy, 2022-NMCA-047, cert. denied.\n\n\"Licensed practitioner\".— In view of the specific exception from licensing requirements granted to students, interns and residents, Subsection K (nowseeSubsection P) should be viewed as allowing prescriptions written by residents or interns to be filled by pharmacists outside the hospital in which the resident or intern is serving. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-93.\n\nNature of outlet.— Whether an outlet is wholesale or retail depends on the manner in which it does business. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-219.\n\n\"Person\".— The health and environment department (now department of health) is not a \"person\" within the meaning of Subsection L (nowseeSubsection U) and is therefore not required to employ licensed pharmacists to dispense drugs to patients at the department's public health clinics. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-76.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 25 Am. Jur. 2d Drugs, Narcotics and Poisons §§ 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 98, 100.\n\n28 C.J.S. Drugs and Narcotics § 8 et seq.",

Defendants are not \"custodial care facilities\" as contemplated by the Pharmacy Act, but are \"community homes,\" as defined by CYFD regulations, which are not required to obtain a pharmacy license to operate.N.M. Boys & Girls Ranch v. N.M. Bd. of Pharmacy, 2022-NMCA-047, cert. denied.\n\nPharmacy board exceeded its regulatory authority by expanding the statutory definition of \"custodial care facility\".— Where the board of pharmacy (board) notified defendants, two community care homes that provide full-time care, supervision and support to children, that they needed a pharmacy license to maintain their children, youth and families department licenses, claiming that defendants were considered \"custodial care facilities\" under the Pharmacy Act, §§ 61-11-1 through 61-11-29 NMSA 1978, and where defendants responded that they were not required to hold a pharmacy license because they were not \"custodial care facilities,\" and where defendants filed a complaint in district court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent their licenses from being revoked, the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting declaratory and injunctive relief in defendants' favor, because the board acted outside its statutory authority in defining \"custodial care facility\" by regulation in a manner that excessively expanded upon the legislature's definition of \"custodial care facility\" in the Pharmacy Act. The board's definition is therefore void.N.M. Boys & Girls Ranch v. N.M. Bd. of Pharmacy, 2022-NMCA-047, cert. denied.\n\nBoard constitutional.— The board is well founded in the police power of the state and cannot be attacked as being unconstitutional. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-126.\n\nConstitutionality of regulating nonresident dealers.— This provision gives the board power to license, regulate and impose a reasonable license fee on resident and nonresident wholesale drug dealers and manufacturers distributing their products in the state, and such action will not violate the United States constitution. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-49.\n\nPowers of board.— The board of pharmacy has power to make bylaws, rules and regulations necessary for the protection of the public in the field of pharmacy and may employ chemists, inspectors, agents and clerical administrative help for the proper conduct of its business. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5776.\n\nJurisdiction over hospital pharmacies.— The board of pharmacy exercises the same powers over pharmacies or drug dispensaries operated by a hospital as it does over any other drug store or pharmacy, etc., operated within the state. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-126.\n\nPresence of pharmacist.— Under broad grant of authority given the board for the protection of public health and welfare, it may promulgate a regulation requiring that a registered pharmacist must be on duty in a drug store from the opening hour of the drug store until the closing hour. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-85.\n\nSharing office space.— The pharmaceutical association and the state board of pharmacy could maintain offices under the same roof and within the same office space, but they would be required to separate their expenditures for rent and clerical help. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5776.\n\nInspector.— Inspector appointed under former law, in the performance of duties, was empowered with all of the powers and duties of law enforcement officers of the state, within which powers was the right to carry such weapons as the occasion appeared to require. 1965 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-93.\n\nAn inspector has all of the authority granted to municipal, county and state law enforcement officers, including the power to obtain search warrants in all cases concerning the violation or violations of the pharmacy laws of the state of New Mexico. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5865 (rendered under former law).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 28 C.J.S. Drugs and Narcotics § 8 et seq.",
