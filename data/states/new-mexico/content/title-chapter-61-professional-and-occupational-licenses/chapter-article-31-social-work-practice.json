For the purposes of the Social Work Practice Act, a person is practicing social work if he advertises, offers himself to practice, is employed in a position described as social work or holds out to the public or represents in any manner that he is licensed to practice social work in this state.\n\nB. Social work practice means a professional service and emphasizes the use of specialized knowledge of social resources, social systems and human capabilities to effect change in human behavior, emotional responses and social conditions. Services may be rendered through direct assistance to individuals, couples, families, groups and community organizations. Social work practice focuses on both direct and indirect services to facilitate change on the intrapersonal, interpersonal and systemic levels. Areas of specialization that address these include but are not limited to the following:\n\n(1) clinical social work practice, which is the professional application of social work theory and methods in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of psychosocial dysfunction, disability or impairment, including but not limited to emotional and mental disorders. It is based on knowledge of one or more theories of human development within a psychosocial context. Clinical social work includes interventions directed to interpersonal interactions, intrapsychic dynamics or life support and management issues. Clinical social work services consist of assessment, diagnosis and treatment, including psychotherapy and counseling, client-centered advocacy, consultation and evaluation;\n\n(2) social work research practice, which is the professional study of human capabilities and practice of social work specialties, including direct and indirect practice, through the formal organization and the methodology of data collection and the analysis and evaluation of social work data;\n\n(3) social work community organization, planning and development practice, which is a conscious process of social interaction and method of social work concerned with the meeting of broad needs and bringing about and maintaining adjustment between needs and resources in a community or other areas; helping people to deal more effectively with their problems and objectives by helping them develop, strengthen and maintain qualities of participation, self-direction and cooperation; and bringing about changes in community and group relationships and in the distribution of decision-making power. The community is the primary client in community organizations. The community may be an organization, neighborhood, city, county, state or national entity;\n\n(4) social work administration, which is the practice that is concerned primarily with translating laws, technical knowledge and administrative rulings into organizational goals and operational policies to guide organizational behavior; designing organizational structure and procedures or processes through which social work goals can be achieved; and securing resources in the form of material, staff, clients and societal legitimation necessary for goal attainment and organizational survival; and\n\n(5) university social work faculty, which provides an equal quality of social work education in identified areas of content; prepares graduates to practice in a range of geographic areas with diverse populations; and establishes the foundation for practitioners' professional futures, exposing them to the best of current knowledge and developing in them the ability to continue questioning and learning, as well as an awareness of their responsibility to continue this professional development.\n\nHistory:Laws 1989, ch. 51, § 6; 1996, ch. 51, § 14.\n\nDelayed repeals.— For delayed repeal of this section,see61-31-25 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1996 amendment,effective March 5, 1996, made a stylistic change in Subsection B and inserted \"university\" at the beginning of Paragraph B(5) and substituted \"faculty\" for \"education practice\" in that paragraph.",

      "text": "A. A licensed social worker shall not be examined without the consent of his client concerning any communication made by the client to him or any advice given to the client in the course of professional employment; nor shall the secretary, stenographer or clerk of a social worker be examined without the consent of his employer concerning any fact, the knowledge of which he has acquired in that capacity; nor shall any person who has participated in any social work practice conducted under the supervision of a person authorized by law to conduct such practice, including group therapy sessions, be examined concerning any knowledge gained during the course of the practice without the consent of the person to whom the testimony sought relates.\n\nB. No licensed social worker may disclose any information he has acquired from a person consulting him in his professional capacity, unless:\n\n(1) he has the written consent of the client or, in the case of death or disability, of his personal representative, any other person authorized to sue or the beneficiary of any insurance policy on his life, health or physical condition;\n\n(2) such communication reveals the contemplation of a crime or harmful act;\n\n(3) the client is under the age of sixteen years or an adult who is mentally fragile and the information acquired indicates that the child or adult was the victim or subject of a crime, in which case the social worker may be required to testify fully in relation to the crime in any examination, trial or other proceeding in which the commission of the crime is a subject of inquiry; or\n\n(4) the person waives the privilege by bringing charges against the social worker.\n\nC. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a licensed social worker from disclosing information in court hearings concerning matters of adoption, child abuse, child neglect or other matters pertaining to the welfare of children as stipulated in the Children's Code [Chapter 32A NMSA 1978] or to those matters pertaining to citizens protected under the Adult Protective Services Act [27-7-14 to 27-7-31 NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:Laws 1989, ch. 51, § 24.\n\nDelayed repeals.— For delayed repeal of this section,see61-31-25 NMSA 1978.\n\nWhen statutory privilege conflicts with constitutional or court rule privilege.— The supreme court's constitutional power of superintending control over all inferior courts carries with it the inherent power to regulate all pleading, practice and procedure affecting the judicial branch of government; with respect to privileges, if a statutory privilege is not consistent with a rule of the supreme court, the statutory privilege is not given effect and the constitutional or court rule privilege prevails.State v. Strauch, 2015-NMSC-009,rev'g2014-NMCA-020.\n\nThe provisions of this section that arguably create social worker evidentiary privileges cannot prevent court-ordered disclosure of communications that would be mandated by the discovery and evidence rules of the supreme court; consequently, statements made to a social worker by an alleged child abuser in private counseling sessions are not protected from disclosure in a court proceeding as a result of the specific exception to the physician-patient and psychotherapist-patient evidentiary privilege in Rule 11-504(D)(4) NMRA, which provides that no privilege shall apply for confidential communications concerning any material that a social worker is required by law to report to a public agency.State v. Strauch, 2015-NMSC-009,rev'g2014-NMCA-020.\n\nApplicability of privilege in a child abuse and neglect casewas not required to be addressed because the clear language of Rule 11-504 NMRA, this section, and Section 61-9A-27 NMSA 1978 permits disclosure.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't, 2000-NMCA-035, 128 N.M. 813, 999 P.2d 1045, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 207, 4 P.3d 35.\n\nRecognition of role licensed social workers play in providing treatment to victims of child abuse and neglect would be consistent with the legislature's recognition of the professional nature of their services.State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dept. v. Frank G., 2005-NMCA-026, 137 N.M. 137, 108 P.3d 543,aff'd, 2006-NMSC-019, 139 N.M. 459, 134 P.3d 746.\n\nIssue not preserved on appeal.— Where defendant argued that the statements he made to social workers, implicating himself in criminal sexual contact with a minor, are privileged, but he did not cite either this section or Jaffee v. Redmond, 518 U.S. 1, 135 L. Ed. 2d 337, 116 S. Ct. 1923 (1996), to support that argument in the trial court, he has not preserved the issue and may not raise it in an appellate court.State v. Neswood, 2002-NMCA-081, 132 N.M. 505, 51 P.3d 1159, cert. denied, 132 N.M. 551, 52 P.3d 411.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 81 Am. Jur. 2d Witnesses §§ 453, 541, 542.\n\n97 C.J.S.
