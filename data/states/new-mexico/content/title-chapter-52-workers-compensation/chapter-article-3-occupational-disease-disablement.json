      "text": "This act shall be known as the \"New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law\".\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 57-1101, enacted by Laws 1945, ch. 135, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 59-11-1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The words \"this act\" refer to Laws 1945, ch. 135, compiled herein as 52-3-1 to 52-3-5, 52-3-7 to 52-3-14, 52-3-32, 52-3-34 to 52-3-41, 52-3-43 to 52-3-46, 52-3-48 to 52-3-54 NMSA 1978.\n\nCross references.— For Occupational Health and Safety Act not to supersede or affect this act,see50-9-21 NMSA 1978.\n\nLiberal construction applies to law.— Liberal construction under the Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Act applies only to the law and not to the facts.Ojinaga v. Dressman, 1972-NMCA-017, 83 N.M. 508, 494 P.2d 170.\n\nCalculation for total disablement.— In calculating a worker's disability benefits for total disablement, the date of disablement shall be used in determining the worker's compensation rate, not the date of last employment or the date of last injurious exposure to the hazards of the employment.Di Luzio v. City of Santa Fe, 2015-NMCA-042.\n\nWhere worker was employed as a firefighter for the city of Santa Fe for twenty-one years and was diagnosed with mantle cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma twelve years after his service as a firefighter, the worker's compensation judge erred in using the date of worker's last employment as a firefighter to calculate disability benefits, and not the date of the occurrence of the disablement as required by this section.Di Luzio v. City of Santa Fe, 2015-NMCA-042.\n\nApplication of rules of procedure.— Language in Section 52-3-18 NMSA 1978 is comparable to Section 52-1-34 NMSA 1978 of the present Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Law and under the rules noted above requires application of the rules of civil procedure in cases arising under the Occupational Disease Disablement Law unless not reasonable to do so.Holman v. Oriental Refinery, 1965-NMSC-029, 75 N.M. 52, 400 P.2d 471 (decided under former law).\n\nRule for leave to amend applicable.— Rule 15(a), N.M.R. Civ. P., (now Rule 1-015 A NMRA) providing for freely granting of leave to amend when justice requires, is applicable to proceedings under the Occupational Disease Disablement Law.Holman v. Oriental Refinery, 1965-NMSC-029, 75 N.M. 52, 400 P.2d 471.\n\nApplicability of estoppel doctrine in Occupational Disease Disablement Law.— Even though the Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Act does not specifically provide for equitable defenses, nevertheless, the appellate court has considered equitable claims and defenses in workmen's (workers') compensation proceedings; therefore, by analogy, if the elements of estoppel are established, the doctrine can be applied in a case arising under the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law.McDonald v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 1979-NMCA-088, 93 N.M. 192, 598 P.2d 654.\n\nDisease must be peculiar to worker's occupation.— In order for the Occupational Disease Disablement Law to apply, it must be established that the disease is peculiar to the worker's occupation and not merely to his workplace.Rader v. Don J. Cummings Co., 1989-NMCA-079, 109 N.M. 219, 784 P.2d 38, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 131, 782 P.2d 384.\n\nUnusual hazard must be shown.— In order for there to be an occupational disease, in addition to the requirement that it be peculiar to claimant's occupation, the conditions must attach to that occupation a hazard that distinguishes it from the usual run of occupations and is in excess of the hazards attending employment in general.Rader v. Don J. Cummings Co., 1989-NMCA-079, 109 N.M. 219, 784 P.2d 38, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 131, 782 P.2d 384.\n\nStandard for admitting expert testimonyestablished byDaubert v. Merrel Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), as adopted inNew Mexico by State v. Alberico, 1993-NMSC-047, 116 N.M. 156, 861 P.2d 192, does not apply to the testimony of a health care provider pursuant to 52-1-28(B) or 52-3-32 NMSA 1978.Banks v. IMC Kalium Carlsbad Potash Co., 2003-NMSC-026, 134 N.M. 421, 77 P.3d 1014.\n\nAsbestosis as occupational disease.— By analogy to silicosis, asbestosis is an occupational disease contracted gradually in the course of employment, and not a physical harm compensable under the doctrine of strict liability in tort.Bassham v. Owens-Corning Fiber Glass Corp., 327 F. Supp. 1007 (D.N.M. 1971).\n\nReinstatement of act.— The decision inState ex rel. Hovey Concrete Prods. Co. v. Mechem, 1957-NMSC-075, 63 N.M. 250, 316 P.2d 1069 in effect reinstated the Occupational Disease Disablement Act. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen.

The following employers, when the conditions and hazards inherent in the occupation involved are such as to expose the employees to any of the hazards of occupational disease, shall be subject to the provisions of the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law: the state and each county, municipality, school district, drainage, irrigation or conservancy district and public institution and administrative board thereof, every charitable organization and every private person, firm or corporation engaged in carrying on business or trade within the state having in service four or more employees regularly employed in the same business or in or about the same establishment under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written, except employers of ranching or agricultural laborers and employers of private domestic servants; provided, however, effective January 1, 1978, the provisions of the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law shall apply to employers of three or more employees, except employers of ranching or agricultural laborers and employers of private domestic servants and, effective January 1, 1990, the provisions of the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law shall apply to all employers of employees, except employers of ranching or agricultural laborers and employers of private domestic servants.

The term \"regularly employed\", as herein used, unless the context otherwise requires, shall include all employments in the usual course of the trade, business, profession or occupation of the employer, whether continuous throughout the year or for only a portion of the year.\n\nC. Any person, firm or corporation engaged in the performance of work as an independent contractor shall be deemed an employer within the meaning of this section. The term \"independent contractor\", as herein used, is defined to be any person, association or corporation engaged in the performance of any work for another, who, while so engaged, is independent of the employer in all that pertains to the execution of the work, is not subject to the rule or control of the employer, is engaged only in the performance of a definite job or piece of work and is subordinate to the employer only in effecting a result in accordance with the employer's design.\n\nD. For the purposes of the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law, an individual who performs services as a qualified real estate salesperson shall not be treated as an employee and the person for whom the services are performed shall not be treated as an employer.\n\nE. For the purpose of Subsection D of this section, a \"qualified real estate salesperson\" means an individual who:\n\n(1) is a licensed real estate salesperson, associate broker or broker under contract with a real estate firm;\n\n(2) receives substantially all of his remuneration, whether or not paid in cash, for the services performed as a real estate salesperson, associate broker or broker under contract with a real estate firm in direct relation to sales or other output, including the performance of services, rather than to the number of hours worked; and\n\n(3) performs services pursuant to written contract between himself and the person for whom the services are performed, and the contract provides that the individual will not be treated as an employee with respect to such services.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 57-1102, enacted by Laws 1945, ch. 135, § 2; 1953 Comp., § 59-11-2; Laws 1971, ch. 261, § 6; 1972, ch. 65, § 3; 1973, ch. 239, § 1; 1975, ch. 317, § 1; 1987, ch. 260, § 2; 1989, ch. 263, § 48.\n\nSubject to act until notice of rejection.— Once an employer has come under the act he remains subject thereto until he complies with giving notice of rejection in the manner by the act provided. 1945 Op.

United Nuclear-Homestake Partners, 1976-NMCA-105, 89 N.M. 704, 556 P.2d 1180, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619.\n\n\"Disablement\"under this section, giving an ordinary meaning to \"incapacity,\" may mean total physical unfitness, by reason of occupational disease, to perform any work for remuneration in the pursuit in which the workman (worker) was engaged.Salazar v. Kaiser Steel Corp., 1973-NMCA-068, 85 N.M. 254, 511 P.2d 580, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 229, 511 P.2d 555 (decided under prior law).\n\nConstrued in pari materia.— The provisions in Sections 52-3-14 and 52-3-15 NMSA 1978 which refer to total and partial disablement, do not change the definition of disablement and do not provide that compensation is payable for partial disablement; the word \"total\" in Section 52-3-14 NMSA 1978 is a redundancy since the only disablement under the section is for total physical incapacity by reason of an occupational disease.Vincent v. United Nuclear-Homestake Partners, 1976-NMCA-105, 89 N.M. 704, 556 P.2d 1180, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619 (decided under prior law).\n\nWorkman (Worker) able to perform other work.— If the proof brings plaintiff within the statutory definition of disablement, the fact that he is still able to work in other fields does not alter this situation. A finding that plaintiff had worked as an underground miner for 27 years, and that he became totally disabled from work as an underground miner, supported the conclusion of disablement, and his work since the date of disablement, other than as an underground miner, had no legal effect on the judgment of disablement.Vincent v. United Nuclear-Homestake Partners, 1976-NMCA-105, 89 N.M. 704, 556 P.2d 1180, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619 (decided under prior law).\n\nWhen the employee was disabled from working as a filling station operator because of the occupational disease, he was disabled from following \"the pursuit in which he was engaged\" and the court did not err in so ruling. That he is still able to work in other fields does not alter this situation.Holman v. Oriental Refinery, 1965-NMSC-029, 75 N.M. 52, 400 P.2d 471 (decided under prior law).\n\nUnder prior law, to be totally disabled, a worker had to prove that he or she was completely unable to perform the tasks comprising the work performed at the time of injury and also was unable to perform any work for which he or she was fitted, based upon his or her age, education, and experience. Under present law, the inquiry is limited to whether the worker is totally unable to perform any work in the occupation in which the worker was engaged. Thus, in determining whether a worker is totally incapacitated, other occupations for which the worker might be fitted are not considered.Bryant v. Lear Siegler Mgmt. Servs. Corp., 1993-NMCA-052, 115 N.M. 502, 853 P.2d 753, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 535, 854 P.2d 362.\n\nWork after finding of disability.— A workman (worker) may, from a clinical standpoint, be totally and permanently disabled but through sheer drive of willpower and habit continue for some time at his job; therefore, that employees worked for varying periods of time after the date the trial court found them to be disabled does not require a ruling that the men were not disabled as a matter of law.Salazar v. Kaiser Steel Corp., 1973-NMCA-068, 85 N.M. 254, 511 P.2d 580, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 229, 511 P.2d 555 (decided under prior law).\n\nSuffer entire loss of earning ability not mean helplessness.— Although the requirements of this section are more definite and specific than the requirements for total disability under the workmen's (workers') compensation law, to suffer an entire loss of wage earning ability does not mean that a workman (worker) must be in a state of absolute helplessness, or unable to do work of any kind.Salazar v. Kaiser Steel Corp., 1973-NMCA-068, 85 N.M. 254, 511 P.2d 580, cert. denied, 85 N.M. 229, 511 P.2d 555 (decided under prior law).\n\nPlaintiff who developed an allergic disorder after inhaling paint fumesand was thus unable to work any longer as a painter was entitled to compensation under this act, even though he might possibly have obtained work in another field.Herrera v. Fluor Utah, Inc., 1976-NMCA-045, 89 N.M. 245, 550 P.2d 144, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 321, 551 P.2d 1368.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —82 Am.

There is imposed upon every employer a liability for the payment of compensation to every employee of such employer who suffers total disablement by reason of an occupational disease arising out of his employment, subject to the following conditions:\n\n(1) no compensation shall be paid when the last day of injurious exposure of the employee to the hazards resulting in an occupational disease occurred prior to the passage of the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law; and\n\n(2) no compensation shall be paid in case of silicosis or asbestosis unless during the ten years immediately preceding the disablement the injured employee was exposed to harmful quantities of silicon dioxide dust or asbestos dust for a total period of no less than twelve hundred fifty work shifts in employment in this state and unless disablement results within two years from the last day upon which the employee actually worked for the employer against whom compensation is claimed. For the purpose of computing work shifts under this section, employment for less than one-half of a normal shift shall be disregarded, and employment for one-half or more of a normal shift shall be deemed a full shift.\n\nB. There is imposed upon every employer a liability for the payment of compensation to the dependents of every employee in cases where death results from an occupational disease arising out of his employment, subject to the following conditions:\n\n(1) no compensation shall be paid when the last day of exposure of the employee to the hazards resulting in death from occupational disease occurred prior to the passage of the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law;\n\n(2) no compensation shall be paid for death from silicosis or asbestosis unless during the ten years immediately preceding the disablement the deceased employee was exposed to harmful quantities of silicon dioxide dust or asbestos dust for a period of not less than twelve hundred fifty work shifts in this state;\n\n(3) no compensation shall be paid for death from silicosis or asbestosis unless the death results within two years from the last day upon which the employee actually worked for the employer against whom compensation is claimed, except in those cases where death results during a period of continuous disablement from silicosis or asbestosis for which compensation has been paid or awarded or for which a claim, compensable but for such death, is on file with the director, and in these cases compensation shall be paid if death results within five years from the last day upon which the employee actually worked for the employer against whom compensation is claimed; and\n\n(4) no compensation shall be paid for death from an occupational disease other than silicosis or asbestosis unless death results within one year from the last day upon which the employee actually worked for the employer against whom compensation is claimed, except in those cases where death results during a period of continuous disablement from an occupational disease other than silicosis or asbestosis for which compensation has been paid or awarded or for which a claim, compensable but for such death, is on file with the director, and in these cases compensation shall be paid if death results within three years from the last day upon which the employee actually worked for the employer against whom compensation is claimed.\n\nC.

The compensation to which a worker who has suffered disablement, or the worker's dependents, shall be entitled under the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law is limited to the provisions of that law. No compensation shall be due or payable under the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law for any disablement that does not result in either the temporary disablement of the worker lasting for more than seven days or in the worker's permanent disablement as herein described or in death; provided, however, that if the period of temporary disablement of the worker lasts for more than four weeks from the date of the disablement, compensation under the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law shall be payable in addition to the amount hereinafter stated in a like amount for the first seven days after the date of disablement. But for any such disablement for which compensation is payable under the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law, the employer shall in all proper cases, as herein provided, pay to the disabled worker or to some person authorized by the director to receive the same, for the use and benefit of the beneficiaries entitled thereto, compensation at regular intervals of no more than sixteen days apart, in accordance with this section, less proper deductions on account of default in failure to give notice of such disablement as required in Section 52-3-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. For total disablement, the worker shall receive sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the worker's average weekly wage, not to exceed a maximum compensation of eighty-five percent of the average weekly wage in the state, a week, effective July 1, 1987, continuing through December 31, 1999, and thereafter not to exceed a maximum of one hundred percent of the average weekly wage in the state, a week, but not to be less than a minimum compensation of thirty-six dollars ($36.00) a week, during the period of such disablement, but in no event to exceed a period of seven hundred weeks; provided, however, that when the workers' wages are less than thirty-six dollars ($36.00) a week, then the compensation to be paid such worker shall be the full amount of such weekly wages; provided further that the benefits paid or payable during a worker's entire period of disablement shall be based on and limited to the benefits in effect on the date of the occurrence of the disablement.\n\nC. For partial disablement, the benefits shall be a percentage of the benefits payable for total disablement calculated under Subsection B of this section as that percentage is determined pursuant to the provisions of Section 52-3-4 NMSA 1978. In no event shall the duration of partial benefits extend longer than five hundred weeks.\n\nD. In no event shall the duration of any combination of disablements, whether temporary or partial disablements, and death be payable for a period in excess of seven hundred weeks.\n\nE. For the purpose of the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law, the average weekly wage in the state shall be determined by the workforce solutions department on or before June 30 of each year and shall be computed from all wages reported to the department from employing units, including reimbursable employers, in accordance with the rules of the department for the preceding calendar year, divided by the total number of covered employees divided by fifty-two. The first such determination by the employment security division of the average weekly wage in the state shall be made on or before June 30, 1975 from reported wages and covered employees for the calendar year ending December 31, 1974.\n\nF. The average weekly wage in the state, determined as provided in Subsection E of this section, shall be applicable for the full period during which compensation is payable when the date of the occurrence of the disablement falls within the calendar year commencing January 1 following the June 30 determination.\n\nG. Unless the computation provided for in Subsection E of this section results in an increase or decrease of two dollars ($2.00) or more, raised to the next whole dollar, the statewide average weekly wage determination shall not be changed for any calendar year.\n\nH. In case death proximately results from the disablement within the period of two years, compensation benefits to be paid such worker shall be in the amounts and to the persons as follows:\n\n(1) if there are no dependents, the compensation shall be limited to the funeral expenses not to exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) and the expenses provided for medical and hospital services for the deceased, together with such other sums as the deceased may have been paid for disablement; or\n\n(2) if there are dependents at the time of death, the payment shall consist of a sum not to exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) for funeral expenses and expenses provided for medical and hospital services for the deceased, together with such other sums as the deceased may have been paid for disability, and a percentage specified in this paragraph for average weekly wages subject to the limitations of the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law to continue for the period of seven hundred weeks from the date of death of such worker; provided that the total death compensation, unless otherwise specified, payable in any of the cases mentioned in this section shall not be less than the minimum weekly compensation provided in Subsection B of this section or more than the maximum weekly compensation provided in Subsection B of this section and shall be based on and limited to the benefits in effect on the date of the occurrence of the disablement.

No compensation shall be allowed for the first seven days after the employee has suffered disablement unless such disablement continues for a period of more than four weeks after the disablement occurs, or in any case, unless the employer is notified thereof within the period specified in Section 52-3-16 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. After disablement and continuing so long as medical and surgical attention is reasonably necessary, the employer shall, subject to the provisions of this section, provide the worker in a timely manner reasonable and necessary health care services from a health care provider.\n\nC. The employer shall initially either select the health care provider for the injured worker or permit the injured worker to make the selection. Subject to the provisions of this section, that selection shall be in effect during the first sixty days from the date the worker receives treatment from the initially selected health care provider.\n\nD. After the expiration of the initial sixty-day period set forth in Subsection C of this section, the party who did not make the initial selection may select a health care provider of his choice. Unless the worker and employer otherwise agree, the party seeking such a change shall file a notice of the name and address of his choice of health care provider with the other party at least ten days before treatment from that health care provider begins. The director shall adopt rules and regulations governing forms, which employers shall post in conspicuous places, to enable this notice to be promptly and efficiently provided. This notice may be filed on or after the fiftieth day of the sixty-day period set forth in Subsection C of this section.\n\nE. If a party objects to the choice of health care provider made pursuant to Subsection D of this section, then he shall file an objection to that choice pursuant to Subsection F of this section with a workers' compensation judge within three days from receiving the notice. He shall also provide notice of that objection to the other party. If the employer does not file his objection within the three-day period, then he shall be liable for the cost of treatment provided by the worker's health care provider until the employer does file his objection and the workers' compensation judge has rendered his decision as set forth in Subsection G of this section. If the worker does not file his objection within the three-day period, then the employer shall only be liable for the cost of treatment from the health care provider selected by the employer, subject to the provisions of Subsections F, G and H of this section. Nothing in this section shall remove the employer's obligation to provide reasonable and necessary health care services to the worker so long as the worker complies with the provisions of this section.\n\nF. If the worker or employer disagrees with the choice of the health care provider of the other party at any time, including the initial sixty-day period, and they cannot otherwise agree, then he shall submit a request for a change of health care provider to a workers' compensation judge. The director shall adopt rules and regulations governing forms, which employers shall post in conspicuous places, to submit to a workers' compensation judge a request for a change of a health care provider.\n\nG. The request shall state the reasons for the request and may state the applicant's choice for a different health care provider. The applicant shall bear the burden of proving to the workers' compensation judge that the care being received is not reasonable. The workers' compensation judge shall render his decision within seven days from the date the request was submitted. If the workers' compensation judge grants the request, he shall designate either the applicant's choice of health care provider or a different health care provider.\n\nH. If the worker continues to receive treatment or services from a health care provider rejected by the employer and not in compliance with the workers' compensation judge's ruling, then the employer is not required to pay for any of the additional treatment or services provided to that worker by that health care provider.\n\nI. In all cases where the disablement is such as to permit the use of artificial members, including teeth and eyes, the employer shall pay for such artificial members.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 57-1114a, enacted by Laws 1951, ch. 184, § 2; 1953 Comp., § 59-11-15; Laws 1965, ch. 299, § 3; 1971, ch. 261, § 9; 1973, ch. 239, § 6; 1977, ch. 276, § 3; 1987, ch. 235, § 37; 1990 (2nd S.S.), ch. 2, § 36.\n\nThe 1990 (2nd S.S.) amendment,effective January 1, 1991, inserted \"selection of health care provider\" in the catchline, substituted \"or\" for \"nor\" in Subsection A, rewrote Subsections B and C, added Subsections D to H, and redesignated former Subsection D as Subsection I, substituting \"pay for\" for \"furnish\" therein.\n\nLump-sum payment and release agreement effective as waiver of statutory rights.— Lump-sum payment and release agreement which stated, among other things, that claimant would be treated by present physician or his referral for life was a binding contract, and constituted a waiver of employer's right under this section to designate a change in claimant's primary care provider.Ramirez v. Johnny's Roofing, Inc., 1999-NMCA-038, 127 N.M. 83, 977 P.2d 348.\n\nIn absence of evidence of wages, earnings or disability percentile,and in light of plaintiff's admission at oral argument that there was no proof of a percentage of disability and her failure to refute court's conclusion, the court's judgment denying recovery was not erroneous even though the act authorizes payment for partial disability.Ojinaga v.

If the worker fails to give notice in the manner and within the time required by Section 52-3-19 NMSA 1978 or if the worker fails to file a claim for benefits within the time required by this section, his claim for benefits, all his right to the recovery of benefits and the bringing of any proceeding for the recovery of compensation are forever barred.\n\nC.

Vocational rehabilitation services are those services designed to return the employee to gainful employment, in the following priority:\n\n(1) pre-injury job with the same employer;\n\n(2) modified work with the same employer;\n\n(3) job related to former employment; or\n\n(4) suitable employment in a nonrelated work field.\n\nC. Subject to the requirements imposed upon the employee and the other limitations of this section, the employer shall furnish vocational rehabilitation services for the employee who has suffered disablement that is covered by the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law. When, as a result of the injury, the employee is unable to perform the pre-injury job with the same employer or unable to perform modified work with the same employer, he shall be entitled to vocational rehabilitation evaluation, counseling and training if necessary to return the employee to either a job related to his former employment or suitable employment in a nonrelated field. The total amount required to be paid by an employer for vocational evaluation and counseling shall not exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500).\n\nD. The employer shall notify the employee in writing of the provisions of this section within thirty days of the first report of disablement required to be filed by the employer under Section 52-3-51 NMSA 1978 if the employee is at the time disabled.\n\nE. To be entitled to vocational rehabilitation services or benefits, a disabled employee must notify the employer in writing that he has been released within one hundred twenty days from the date that he is released from regular treatment by his primary treating health care provider as defined in Section 52-4-1 NMSA 1978. In the event the employee fails to notify the employer, the employer shall not be liable for any vocational rehabilitation benefits.\n\nF. A referral for an evaluation of a [an] employee for suitability for vocational rehabilitation services shall be made by the employer of an employee who notifies the employer under Subsection E of this section. If the evaluation or vocational rehabilitation services are requested and these services are not voluntarily offered by the employer or if offered but not accepted by the employee, the workers' compensation judge upon application affording the parties an opportunity to be heard may determine whether the employee needs evaluation or vocational rehabilitation services and shall cooperate with and refer promptly all cases in need of such services to the appropriate public or private agencies in this state or where necessary in any other state for such services.\n\nG. An employee who is entitled to vocational rehabilitation training shall receive payment for board, lodging, tuition, travel and all other expenses, including the cost or charges for the vocational rehabilitation training, for a period of time not to exceed two years from the date vocational rehabilitation training is determined to be necessary. Any benefits to which an employee is entitled under this section shall not be considered or paid as part of any lump sum settlement of a claim by an employee and payment by the employer shall only be required as services are incurred.\n\nH. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to submit to all reasonable requests for evaluations made by the employer or required by the workers' compensation judge, as may be necessary, to determine the need for or to develop a plan for vocational rehabilitation. However, the employee shall not be required to bear the cost of any evaluation requested by the employer, notwithstanding the limitation on expenditures specified in Subsection C of this section. If the employee refuses to submit to evaluation or to accept vocational rehabilitation training pursuant to an order of a workers' compensation judge, the employer's liability to the employee shall be limited to medical and disability benefits under the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 52-3-17, enacted by Laws 1987, ch. 235, § 38; 1989, ch. 263, § 53.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1987, ch. 235, ch. 38 repealed former 52-3-17 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1986, ch. 22, § 59 and enacted a new 52-3-17 NMSA 1978, effective June 19, 1987.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nBookkeeping not \"suitable employment\" for sheet-metal fabricator.— A bookkeeping position was not \"suitable employment\" for a worker who, prior to his injury, was a sheet-metal fabricator.Bryant v.

The disease must be incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of employer and employee. The disease need not have been foreseen or expected but after its contraction must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and to have flowed from that source as a natural consequence. In all cases where the defendant denies that an alleged occupational disease is the material and direct result of the conditions under which work was performed, the worker must establish that causal connection as a medical probability by medical expert testimony. No award of compensation benefits shall be based on speculation or on expert testimony that as a medical possibility the causal connection exists.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 57-1119, enacted by Laws 1945, ch. 135, § 19; 1953 Comp., § 59-11-20; Laws 1965, ch. 299, § 17; 1989, ch. 263, § 57.\n\nWork-related factors need not be predominate causative agent of occupational disease or death,so long as the work-related factors can be reasonably categorized by medical experts as a nonnegligible contributing cause as a matter of medical probability.Buchanan v.

      "text": "A. As used in this section, \"firefighter\" means a person who is employed as a full-time non-volunteer firefighter by the state or a local government entity and who has taken the oath prescribed for firefighters.\n\nB. If a firefighter is diagnosed with one or more of the following conditions after the period of employment indicated, and the condition was not revealed during an initial employment medical screening examination or during a subsequent medical review pursuant to the Occupational Health and Safety Act [50-9-1 to 50-9-25 NMSA 1978] and rules promulgated pursuant to that act, the condition is presumed to be proximately caused by employment as a firefighter:\n\n(1) brain cancer after ten years;\n\n(2) bladder cancer after twelve years;\n\n(3) kidney cancer after fifteen years;\n\n(4) colorectal cancer after ten years;\n\n(5) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after fifteen years;\n\n(6) leukemia after five years;\n\n(7) ureter cancer after twelve years;\n\n(8) testicular cancer after five years if diagnosed before the age of forty with no evidence of anabolic steroids or human growth hormone use;\n\n(9) breast cancer after five years if diagnosed before the age of forty without a breast cancer 1 or breast cancer 2 genetic predisposition to breast cancer;\n\n(10) esophageal cancer after ten years;\n\n(11) multiple myeloma after fifteen years;\n\n(12) hepatitis, tuberculosis, diphtheria, meningococcal disease and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus appearing and diagnosed after entry into employment; or\n\n(13) posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosed by a physician or psychologist that results in physical impairment, primary or secondary mental impairment or death.\n\nC. The presumptions created in Subsections B and D of this section may be rebutted by a preponderance of evidence in a court of competent jurisdiction showing that the firefighter engaged in conduct or activities outside of employment that posed a significant risk of contracting or developing a described condition.\n\nD. If a firefighter is diagnosed with a heart injury or stroke suffered within twenty-four hours of fighting a fire, while responding to an alarm, while returning from an alarm call, while engaging in supervised physical training or while responding to or performing in a non-fire emergency, the heart injury or stroke is presumed to be proximately caused by employment as a firefighter. The presumption created in this subsection shall not be made if the firefighter's employer does not have a current physical training program and the firefighter does not have a current medical screening examination or review pursuant to the Occupational Health and Safety Act and rules promulgated pursuant to that act allowing participation in that program.\n\nE. When any presumptions created in this section do not apply, it shall not preclude a firefighter from demonstrating a causal connection between employment and condition or injury by a preponderance of evidence in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nF. Medical treatment based on the presumptions created in this section shall be provided by an employer as for a job-related condition or injury unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the presumption does not apply. If the court determines that the presumption does not apply or that the condition or injury is not job related, the employer's workers' compensation insurance provider shall be reimbursed for health care costs by the medical or health insurance plan or benefit provided for the firefighter by the employer.\n\nHistory:Laws 2009, ch. 252, § 1; 2019, ch. 118, § 1.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective June 14, 2019, added posttraumatic stress disorder to the list of conditions presumed to be proximately caused by employment as a firefighter; replaced \"disease\" with \"condition\" throughout the section; in Subsection A, added Paragraph A(13); and in Subsection F, replaced each occurrence of \"illness\" with \"condition\".\n\nStatutory presumption that the development of a listed disease is proximately caused by employment as a firefighter.— By enacting the firefighter occupational disease statute, the legislature adopted a statutory presumption that the development of the listed disease by a firefighter is linked to his or her service in that role under certain circumstances and exempts firefighters in certain situations from the burden of establishing a causal connection between their disease and their duties as a firefighter; when a firefighter establishes that he or she is suffering from one or more of the diseases listed in this section and the firefighter served the requisite number of years, subject to any other requirements under this section, the firefighter is entitled to the rebuttable presumption that the disease was caused by his or her employment as a firefighter.Di Luzio v. City of Santa Fe, 2015-NMCA-042.\n\nWhere worker was employed as a firefighter for the City of Santa Fe for twenty-one years and was diagnosed with mantle cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma twelve years after his service as a firefighter, worker met the statutory prerequisites to be entitled to the presumption that his disease was the result of his years of service as a firefighter, and was not required to establish that his disease was causally connected to his employment.Di Luzio v. City of Santa Fe, 2015-NMCA-042.\n\nTest for retroactive application of the statute.— The relevant inquiry for determining whether this section was being applied retroactively or prospectively is not whether the firefighter was employed as a firefighter at the time of the statute's enactment, but rather whether this section was in existence at the time the firefighter filed for disability benefits. Di Luzio v. City of Santa Fe, 2015-NMCA-042.\n\nWhere worker was employed as a firefighter for the city of Santa Fe for twenty-one years and was diagnosed with mantle cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma twelve years after his service as a firefighter, and where worker filed for disability benefits two years after this section's enactment, application of the statute was not retroactive.Di Luzio v.

Singer Bus. Machs., 1978-NMCA-113, 92 N.M. 261, 586 P.2d 1090.\n\nMeaning of \"peculiar to\".— The phrase \"peculiar to\" is not used in the sense that the disease must be one which originates exclusively from the particular kind of employment in which the employee is engaged, but rather in the sense that the conditions of that employment must result in a hazard which distinguishes it in character from the general run of occupations.Martinez v. University of Cal., 1979-NMSC-073, 93 N.M. 455, 601 P.2d 425.\n\nOccupational disease does not includea disease which results from peculiar conditions surrounding the workmen's ( workers') employment as long as the nature of that work is not more likely to cause the disability than other kinds of employment carried on under the same conditions.Marable v.

      "text": "A. In the event of a dispute concerning any medical issue, if the parties cannot agree upon the use of a specific independent medical examiner, either party may petition a workers' compensation judge for permission to have the worker undergo an independent medical examination. The independent medical examination shall be performed immediately, pursuant to procedures adopted by the director, by a health care provider other than the designated health care provider, unless the employer and the worker otherwise agree.\n\nB. In deciding who may conduct the independent medical examination, the workers' compensation judge shall not designate the health care provider initially chosen by the petitioner. The workers' compensation judge shall designate a health care provider on the approved list of persons authorized by the committee appointed by the advisory council on workers' compensation to create that list. The decision of the workers' compensation judge shall be final. The employer shall pay for any independent medical examination.\n\nC. Only the health care provider who has treated the worker pursuant to Section 52-3-15 NMSA 1978 or the health care provider providing the independent medical examination pursuant to this section may offer testimony at any workers' compensation hearing concerning the particular disablement in question.\n\nD. If, pursuant to Subsection D of Section 52-3-15 NMSA 1978, the injured worker selects a new health care provider, the employer shall be entitled to periodic examinations of the worker by the health care provider he previously selected. Examinations may not be required more frequently than at six-month intervals; except that upon application to the workers' compensation judge having jurisdiction of the claim and after reasonable cause therefor, examinations within six-month intervals may be ordered. In considering such applications, the workers' compensation judge should exercise care to prevent harassment of the claimant.\n\nE. If the employer requests an independent medical examination or an examination pursuant to Subsection D of this section, the worker shall travel to the place at which the examination shall be conducted. Within thirty days after the examination, the worker shall be compensated by the party requesting the examination for all necessary and reasonable expenses incidental to submitting to the examination, including the cost of travel, meals, lodging, loss of pay or other like direct expense, but the amount to be compensated for meals and lodging shall not exceed that allowed for nonsalaried public officers under the Per Diem and Mileage Act [10-8-1 to 10-8-8 NMSA 1978].\n\nF. No attorney shall be present at any examination authorized under this section.\n\nG. Both the employer and the worker shall be given a copy of the report of the examination of the worker made by the independent health care provider pursuant to this section.\n\nH. If a worker fails or refuses to submit to examination in accordance with this section, he shall forfeit all disablement compensation benefits that would accrue or become due to him except for such failure or refusal to submit to examination during the period that he persists in such failure and refusal unless he is by reason of disability unable to appear for examination.\n\nI. If any employee persists in any unsanitary or injurious practice that tends to imperil, retard or impair his recovery or increase his disability or refuses to submit to such medical or surgical treatment as is reasonably essential to promote his recovery, the workers' compensation judge may in his discretion reduce or suspend the employee's disablement compensation benefits.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 52-3-39, enacted by Laws 1987, ch. 235, § 40; 1989, ch. 263, § 61; 1990 (2nd S.S.), ch. 2, § 38.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1987, ch. 235, § 40 repealed former 52-3-39 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1986, ch. 22, § 63 and enacted a new 52-3-39 NMSA 1978, effective June 19, 1987.\n\nThe 1990 (2nd S.S.) amendment,effective January 1, 1991, rewrote the section, including the catchline, to the extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nExpert testimony.— The standard for admitting expert testimony established byDaubert v.

If the claimant substantially prevails on the claim, as determined by a workers' compensation judge, any discovery cost advanced by the employer shall be paid by that employer. If the claimant does not substantially prevail on the claim, as determined by a workers' compensation judge, the employer shall be reimbursed for discovery costs advanced according to a schedule for reimbursement approved by a workers' compensation judge.\n\nE. In all cases where compensation to which any person is entitled under the provisions of the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law is refused and the claimant thereafter collects compensation through proceedings before the workers' compensation administration or courts in an amount in excess of the amount offered in writing by an employer five business days or more prior to the informal hearing before the administration, the compensation to be paid the attorney for the claimant shall be fixed by the workers' compensation judge hearing the claim or the courts upon appeal in the amount the workers' compensation judge or courts deem reasonable and proper, subject to the limitation of Subsection I of this section. In determining and fixing a reasonable fee, the workers' compensation judge or courts shall take into consideration:\n\n(1) the sum, if any, offered by the employer:\n\n(a) before the employee's attorney was employed;\n\n(b) after the attorney's employment but before proceedings were commenced; and\n\n(c) in writing five business days or more prior to the informal hearing;\n\n(2) the present value of the award made in the employee's favor; and\n\n(3) the failure of a party to participate in a good-faith manner in informal claim resolution methods adopted by the director.\n\nF. After a recommended resolution has been issued and rejected, but more than ten days before a trial begins, the employer or claimant may serve upon the opposing party an offer to allow a compensation order to be taken against the employer or claimant for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer, with costs then accrued, subject to the following:\n\n(1) if, within ten days after the service of the offer, the opposing party serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service thereof, and thereupon that compensation order may be entered as the workers' compensation judge may direct. An offer not accepted shall be deemed withdrawn, and evidence thereof is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs. If the compensation order finally obtained by the party is not more favorable than the offer, that party shall pay the costs incurred by the opposing party after the making of the offer. The fact that an offer has been made but not accepted does not preclude a subsequent offer;\n\n(2) when the liability of one party to another has been determined by a compensation order, but the amount or extent of the liability remains to be determined by further proceedings, the party adjudged liable may make an offer, which shall have the same effect as an offer made before trial if it is served within a reasonable time not less than ten days prior to the commencement of hearings to determine the amount or extent of liability;\n\n(3) if the employer's offer was greater than the amount awarded by the compensation order, the employer shall not be liable for the employer's fifty-percent share of the attorney fees to be paid the worker's attorney and the worker shall pay one hundred percent of the attorney fees due to the worker's attorney; and\n\n(4) if the worker's offer was less than the amount awarded by the compensation order, the employer shall pay one hundred percent of the attorney fees to be paid the worker's attorney, and the worker shall be relieved from any responsibility for paying any portion of the worker's attorney fees.\n\nG. In all actions arising under the provisions of Section 52-3-35 NMSA 1978, where the jurisdiction of the workers' compensation administration is invoked to determine the question of whether the claimant's disablement has terminated and the claimant is represented by an attorney, the workers' compensation judge or courts upon appeal shall determine and fix a reasonable fee for the services of the claimant's attorney only if the employer is unsuccessful in establishing that the claimant's disablement has terminated. The fee when fixed by the workers' compensation judge or courts upon appeal shall be taxed as part of the costs against the employer and shall be the limit of the fee received or to be received by the attorney for services in the action, subject to the limitation of Subsection I of this section.\n\nH. In determining reasonable attorney fees for a claimant, the workers' compensation judge shall consider only those benefits to the employee that the attorney is responsible for securing. The value of future medical benefits shall not be considered in determining attorney fees.\n\nI. Attorney fees, including, but not limited to, the costs of paralegal services, legal clerk services and any other related legal services costs on behalf of a claimant or an employer for a single disablement claim, including representation before the workers' compensation administration and the courts on appeal, shall not exceed twenty-two thousand five hundred dollars ($22,500). This limitation applies whether the claimant or employer has one or more attorneys representing the claimant or employer and applies as a cumulative limitation on compensation for all legal services rendered in all proceedings and other matters directly related to a single occupational disease of a claimant. The workers' compensation judge may exceed the maximum amount stated in this subsection in awarding a reasonable attorney fee if the judge finds that a claimant, an insurer or an employer acted in bad faith with regard to handling the disabled employee's claims and the employer or disabled employee has suffered economic loss as a result thereof. However, in no case shall this additional amount exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000). As used in this subsection, \"bad faith\" means conduct by the claimant, insurer or employer in the handling of a claim that amounts to fraud, malice, oppression or willful, wanton or reckless disregard of the rights of the employee or employer. Any determination of bad faith shall be made by the workers' compensation judge through a separate fact-finding proceeding. Not withstanding the provisions of Subsection J of this section, the party found to have acted in bad faith shall pay one hundred percent of the additional fees awarded for representation of the prevailing party in a bad faith action.\n\nJ. Except as provided in Paragraphs (3) and (4) of Subsection F of this section, the payment of a claimant's attorney fees determined under this section shall be shared equally by the employee and the employer.\n\nK. It is unlawful for any person except a licensed attorney to receive or agree to receive any fee or payment for legal services in connection with any claim for compensation under the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law.\n\nL. Nothing in this section applies to agents, excluding attorneys, representing employers, insurance carriers or the subsequent injury fund in any matter arising from a claim under the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law.\n\nM. No attorney fees shall be paid until the claim has been settled or adjudged.\n\nN. Every person violating the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than five hundred dollars ($500), to which may be added imprisonment in the county jail for a term not exceeding ninety days.\n\nO. Nothing in this section shall restrict a claimant from being represented before the workers' compensation administration by a nonattorney as long as that nonattorney receives no compensation for representation from the claimant.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 52-3-47, enacted by Laws 1987, ch. 235, § 41; 1989, ch. 263, § 65; 1990 (2nd S.S.), ch. 2, § 39; 1993, ch. 193, § 7; 2013, ch. 168, § 2.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1987, ch. 235, § 41 repealed former 52-3-47 NMSA 1978, as enacted by Laws 1986, ch. 22, § 67 and enacted a new 52-3-47 NMSA 1978, effective June 19, 1987.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 1987, ch. 235, § 54A, effective June 19, 1987, repealed Laws 1986, ch. 22, § 105 which had formerly repealed this section effective July 1, 1987.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective June 14, 2013, raised the limits for discovery costs; raised the limits for attorney fees; and in Subsection I, in the second sentence, after \"up to a limit of\", deleted \"one thousand dollars ($1,000)\" and added \"three thousand dollars ($3,000)\"; and in Subsection I, in the first sentence, after \"shall not exceed\", deleted \"twelve thousand five hundred dollars ($12,500)\" and added \"twenty-two thousand five hundred dollars ($22,500)\", in the fourth sentence, after \"additional amount exceed\", deleted \"two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500)\" and added \"five thousand dollars ($5,000)\", and added the seventh sentence.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, substituted \"discovery\" for \"deposition\" in the catchline; made a minor stylistic change in Subsection C; in Subsection F(3), substituted \"worker's\" for \"claimant's\" and added \"and the worker shall pay one hundred percent of the attorneys' fees due to the worker's attorney\" at the end; in Subsection F(4), substituted \"worker's\" for \"employer's\" preceding \"offer\", \"worker's\" for \"claimant's\" preceding \"attorney\", \"worker\" for \"claimant\", and \"the worker's\" for \"his attorneys' \" preceding \"fees\"; deleted \"Except for attorneys' fees incurred by an agency of the state or any political subdivsion of the state\" at the beginning of Subsection M; and made a minor stylistic change in Subsection O.\n\nThe 1990 (2nd S.S.) amendment,effective January 1, 1991, inserted \"deposition costs; offer of judgment\" in the catchline and rewrote the section to the extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nAn award of an attorney's fee is authorized in each case,and the award is for an amount the trial court deems reasonable and proper.
