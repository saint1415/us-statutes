      "text": "It is the intent of the legislature in creating the workers' compensation administration that the laws administered by it to provide a workers' benefit system be interpreted to assure the quick and efficient delivery of indemnity and medical benefits to injured and disabled workers at a reasonable cost to the employers who are subject to the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act [Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978] and the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law [52-3-1 NMSA 1978]. It is the specific intent of the legislature that benefit claims cases be decided on their merits and that the common law rule of \"liberal construction\" based on the supposed \"remedial\" basis of workers' benefits legislation shall not apply in these cases. The workers' benefit system in New Mexico is based on a mutual renunciation of common law rights and defenses by employers and employees alike. Accordingly, the legislature declares that the Workers' Compensation Act and the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law are not remedial in any sense and are not to be given a broad liberal construction in favor of the claimant or employee on the one hand, nor are the rights and interests of the employer to be favored over those of the employee on the other hand.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 52-5-1, enacted by Laws 1987, ch. 342, § 30; 1989, ch. 263, § 70; 1990 (2nd S.S.), ch. 2, § 53.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1987, ch. 342, § 30 repealed former 52-5-1 NMSA 1978, as enacted by Laws 1986, ch. 22, § 27, relating to creation of workmen's compensation administration, effective July 1, 1987, and enacted a new 52-5-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nCross references.— For authority to establish workers' compensation division,seeN.M. Const., art. III, § 1.\n\nThe 1990 (2nd S.S.) amendment,effective January 1, 1991, substituted \"administration\" for \"division of the labor department\" near the beginning of the first sentence.\n\nAppropriations.— Laws 1990, ch. 65, § 3, effective May 16, 1990, appropriated $750,000 from the workers' compensation administration fund to the workers' compensation division of the labor department for expenditure in the seventy-ninth fiscal year for the purpose of providing for the review and other services provided pursuant to 52-4-2 and 52-4-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nConstitutionality.— This section is a statement of legislative intent; legislature did not intend the courts to disregard precedent by applying a liberal construction, and therefore this section does not violate the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.Benavides v. Eastern N.M. Med. Ctr., 2014-NMSC-037,rev'gNo. 32,450, mem. Op. (N.M. Ct. App. Mar. 25, 2013) (non-precedential).\n\nWorkers' Compensation Act fulfills its purpose through a bargainin which an injured worker gives up his or her right to sue the employer for damages in return for an expedient settlement covering medical expenses and wage benefits, while the employer gives up her defenses in return for immunity from a tort claim.Morales v. Reynolds, 2004-NMCA-098, 136 N.M. 280, 97 P.3d 612, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-008, 136 N.M. 492, 100 P.3d 197.\n\nLegislative intent.— This section calls for a balanced and evenhanded construction of the Workers' Compensation Act.Gomez v. B.E. Harvey Gin Corp., 1990-NMSC-057, 110 N.M. 100, 792 P.2d 1143.\n\nThe legislature's rejection of the rule of liberal construction of the Workers' Compensation Act in favor of workers does not preclude adoption of the traveling-employee rule.Ramirez v. Dawson Prod. Partners, Inc., 2000-NMCA-011, 128 N.M. 601, 995 P.2d 1043.\n\nThis section is a prospectively applicable statement of legislative intent that neither attempts nor purports to retroactively dismantle established workers' compensation case law enunciated under the rule of liberal construction.Garcia v. Mt. Taylor Millwork, Inc., 1989-NMCA-100, 111 N.M. 17, 801 P.2d 87, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 282, 795 P.2d 87.\n\nThis section is a prospective statement of legislative intent which leaves intact the premises exception to the going and coming rule adopted inDupper v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 1987-NMSC-007, 105 N.M. 503, 734 P.2d 743.Garcia v. Mt. Taylor Millwork, Inc., 1989-NMCA-100, 111 N.M. 17, 801 P.2d 87, cert. denied, 110 N.M. 282, 795 P.2d 87.\n\nThe decision in this case comports with the legislative intent expressed in this section.Jackson v. K & M Constr., 2004-NMCA-082, 136 N.M. 94, 94 P.3d 837, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-007, 136 N.M. 452, 99 P.3d 1164.\n\nAll claims to be filed with division.— All claims, regardless of when the injury or death may have occurred, shall be filed with the workmen's (workers') compensation administration (now the workers' compensation division).Wylie Corp. v. Mowrer, 1986-NMSC-075, 104 N.M. 751, 726 P.2d 1381.\n\nLaw reviews.— For case note, \"WORKERS' COMPENSATION LAW: A Clinical Psychologist Is Qualified to Give Expert Medical Testimony Regarding Causation: Madrid v.

      "text": "A. When a dispute arises under the Workers' Compensation Act [Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978] or the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law [52-3-1 NMSA 1978], any party may file a claim with the director no sooner than thirty-one days from the date of injury or the occurrence of the disabling disease. The director shall assist workers and employees not represented by counsel in the preparation of the claim document.\n\nB. The director shall prepare a form of claim, which shall be available to all parties. The claim shall state concisely in numbered paragraphs the questions at issue or in dispute that the claimant expects to be determined with sufficient particularity that the responding or opposing party may be notified adequately of the claim and its basis, including, if applicable, the specific benefit that is due and not paid.\n\nC. Upon receipt, every claim shall be evaluated by the director or the director's designee, who shall then contact all parties and attempt to informally resolve the dispute. Within sixty days after receipt of the claim, the director shall issue recommendations for resolution and serve the parties with a copy. Within thirty days of receipt of the recommendation of the director, each party shall notify the director on a form provided by the director of the acceptance or rejection of the recommendation. A party failing to notify the director waives any right to reject the recommendation and is bound conclusively by the director's recommendation unless, upon application made to the director within thirty days after the foregoing deadline, the director finds that the party's failure to notify was the result of excusable neglect. If either party makes a timely rejection of the director's recommendation, the claim shall be assigned to a workers' compensation judge for hearing.\n\nD. Each party to a dispute shall have a peremptory right to disqualify one workers' compensation judge; provided that:\n\n(1) the employer and the employer's insurer shall constitute a single party for purposes of this subsection;\n\n(2) this peremptory right to disqualify one worker's compensation judge shall not apply to the judge appointed pursuant to Section 52-1-49 NMSA 1978 to render a decision within seven days on a request for a different health care provider; and\n\n(3) no party shall be required to disqualify a workers' compensation judge until a judge has been assigned to a case.\n\nHistory:Laws 1986, ch. 22, § 31; 1987, ch. 235, § 47; 1989, ch. 263, § 74; 1993, ch. 193, § 10; 2013, ch. 134, § 7.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective July 1, 2013, allowed the workers' compensation administration to serve parties in formats in addition to certified mail; and in Subsection C, in the second sentence, after \"resolution and\", deleted \"provide\" and added \"serve\" and after \"with a copy\" deleted \"by certified mail, return receipt requested\".\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, in Subsection D, added the Paragraph (1) designation and made a minor stylistic change in Paragraph (1), and added Paragraphs (2) and (3).\n\nModification of resolution.— A party may petition a workers' compensation judge to modify a binding recommended resolution within the two-year time period provided by statute, so long as the party's application is based on one of the statutorily enumerated grounds.Hidalgo v. Ribble Contracting, 2008-NMSC-028, 144 N.M. 117, 184 P.3d 429.\n\nJurisdiction over Indians.— Where worker was injured during the course of worker's employment by an Indian tribe at a ski run that was operated by the Indian tribe and the ski run was located on federal, not tribal land; the Indian tribe did not waive sovereign immunity by operating the ski run off tribal land, the location of the ski run off tribal land did not confer jurisdiction to the state, and the workers' compensation judge lacked subject matter jurisdiction of worker's claim.Antonio v. Inn of the Mountain Gods Resort & Casino, 2010-NMCA-077, 148 N.M. 858, 242 P.3d 425, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-007, 148 N.M. 610, 241 P.3d 611.\n\nFiling in improper venue.— The one-year statute of limitations under this section was satisfied by the diligent filing of the complaint, although it was in an improper venue. The statutory period was tolled during the pendency of the action, including the time consumed on appeal.Bracken v. Yates Petroleum Corp., 1988-NMSC-072, 107 N.M. 463, 760 P.2d 155 (decided under prior law).\n\nTime limit.— The language of Subsection C indicates a legislative intent that a time limit exist on the authority of the director to vacate or modify a recommended disposition, thus requiring (1) a showing of good cause, and (2) that the motion for reconsideration was made within 30 days following receipt by the parties of the hearing officer's proposed informal recommendation.Armijo v. Save 'N Gain, 1989-NMCA-014, 108 N.M. 281, 771 P.2d 989.\n\nThe division should not be deprived of administrative jurisdiction when the issuance of recommended resolutions are delayed beyond the prescribed statutory time limit.Armijo v. Save 'N Gain, 1989-NMCA-014, 108 N.M. 281, 771 P.2d 989.\n\nFailure of the director to comply with the legislative time constraints imposed by Subsection C permits the parties to either waive any delay in the rendition of the informal resolution and await the recommended resolution or, if no informal resolution has been filed after the expiration of the 60-day period, to invoke its rights to a prompt hearing on the merits before a hearing officer without further delay and without the necessity of awaiting the issuance of an informal settlement recommendation.Armijo v. Save 'N Gain, 1989-NMCA-014, 108 N.M. 281, 771 P.2d 989.\n\nRelief from mistake.— Subsection C of this section provides the exclusive procedure for obtaining relief from the binding effect of an accepted recommended resolution on the grounds of mistake.Medina v. Hunemuller Constr., Inc., 2005-NMCA-123, 138 N.M. 472, 122 P.3d 839.\n\nFailure to timely respond to recommended resolution.— Examination of Subsection C of this section in context with the act as a whole indicates that the legislature intended that a party's failure to timely respond to a recommended resolution would preclude a later attempt to contest the recommended resolution for mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect under Subsection B(2) of Section 52-5-9 NMSA 1978.Norman v. Lockheed Eng'g & Science Co., 1991-NMCA-101, 112 N.M. 618, 817 P.2d 1260.\n\nTo the extent that the provisions of Section 52-5-5C and 52-5-9B(2) NMSA 1978 are conflicting, the former section is the more specific and governs.Norman v. Lockheed Eng'g & Science Co., 1991-NMCA-101, 112 N.M. 618, 817 P.2d 1260.\n\nSince respondents failed to notify the workers' compensation judge of excusable neglect within the time limit specified in Subsection C of this section, they could not subsequently file a rejection to the recommended resolution under the two-year time limit provided in Section 52-5-9 NMSA 1978.Norman v. Lockheed Eng'g & Science Co., 1991-NMCA-101, 112 N.M. 618, 817 P.2d 1260.\n\nAllowing a party up to two years to assert mistake or excusable neglect as a basis for filing a rejection to the recommended resolution would make a nullity of the time limits in Subsection C of this section.Norman v. Lockheed Eng'g & Science Co., 1991-NMCA-101, 112 N.M. 618, 817 P.2d 1260.\n\nTime limits for modifications.— A party who fails to file a response to a recommended resolution is governed by the time limits of Subsection C when seeking to modify compensation order based on mistake or excusable neglect; when considering other grounds for modification under Section 52-5-9 NMSA 1978, excluding mistake or excusable neglect, the two-year limitation period of Section 52-5-9 NMSA 1978 applies as with any other compensation order.Fasso v. Sierra Healthcare Ctr., 1994-NMCA-170, 119 N.M. 132, 888 P.2d 1014.\n\nSince the worker sought to modify recommended worker's compensation resolution on the basis of her change in condition, the two-year provision in Section 52-5-9B NMSA 1978 applied and not the shorter limitations period in Subsection C.Fasso v. Sierra Healthcare Ctr., 1994-NMCA-170, 119 N.M. 132, 888 P.2d 1014.\n\nTime limits for relief from recommended resolution.— Section 52-5-9 B(2) NMSA 1978 does not provide a basis for obtaining relief from a recommended resolution on the basis of mistake once the time limits of Subsection C of this section governing withdrawal of an acceptance have expired.Medina v. Hunemuller Constr., Inc., 2005-NMCA-123, 138 N.M. 472, 122 P.3d 839.\n\nWorker's burden to establish entitlement to benefits.— Although an employer filed with the administration a petition to reduce benefits seeking a termination or reduction of temporary total disability benefits, it did not bear the burden of persuading the judge that the worker's benefits should be terminated or reduced. The burden was on the worker to establish entitlement to benefits.Gallegos v. City of Albuquerque, 1993-NMCA-050, 115 N.M. 461, 853 P.2d 163, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 535, 854 P.2d 362.\n\nInitiation of claim by employer.— An employer had standing to initiate a worker's compensation action for death benefits on behalf of its employee.Eldridge v. Circle K Corp., 1997-NMCA-022, 123 N.M. 145, 934 P.2d 1074, cert. denied, 122 N.M. 808, 932 P.2d 498.\n\nWhen an employer initiated a worker's compensation death claim on behalf of its employee, and the employee's estate filed an action in district court against the employer for intentional wrongful acts, action on the worker's compensation claim would be deferred until the estate's action for intentional tort was resolved.Eldridge v. Circle K Corp., 1997-NMCA-022, 123 N.M. 145, 934 P.2d 1074, cert. denied, 122 N.M. 808, 932 P.2d 498.\n\nModification of binding resolution.— A conclusively binding recommendation under this section, after the running of the time for contesting the recommendation, is synonymous with and constitutes an \"award\" within the meaning of Subsection A of Section 52-5-9 NMSA 1978. Thus, jurisdiction vests with the workers' compensation judge (W.C.J.) to modify a conclusively binding recommended resolution under Section 52-5-9 NMSA 1978, and the W.C.J. erred in concluding that a conclusively binding recommended resolution is not a \"compensation order\" as used in Section 52-5-9 NMSA 1978.Norman v. Lockheed Eng'g & Science Co., 1991-NMCA-101, 112 N.M. 618, 817 P.2d 1260.\n\nThe grounds for modification listed in Subsection B of Section 52-5-9 NMSA 1978 do not permit a party to file a delayed response to a recommended resolution once the resolution has become final.Norman v. Lockheed Eng'g & Science Co., 1991-NMCA-101, 112 N.M. 618, 817 P.2d 1260.\n\nDisqualification of judge.— The formal hearing rule adopted by the worker's compensation administration was erroneously interpreted to require a worker to file a provisional challenge to an alternative worker's compensation judge within ten days of the initial notice of judge assignment, in anticipation of the possibility that the opposing party would challenge the first judge. The rule could be properly interpreted to permit each party to exercise a peremptory challenge within ten days of the initial notice of judge assignment or a subsequent notice of judge assignment, if the first judge is excused or recuses himself or herself.Wineman v. Kelly's Restaurant, 1991-NMCA-128, 113 N.M. 184, 824 P.2d 324.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —82 Am. Jur. 2d Workers' Compensation § 488 et seq.\n\n100 C.J.S.

      "text": "A. Unless the parties agree otherwise, or it is ordered by the workers' compensation judge or the director in the case of a director's hearing, hearings shall be held at an office of the workers' compensation administration that is located nearest to the location of injury or disablement. In determining the site of hearing, the judge or the director shall consider cost-effectiveness, judicial efficiency, the health and mobility of the worker and the convenience of parties and witnesses. Hearings may be conducted by videoconferencing or by telephone at the discretion of the judge or the director.\n\nB. The workers' compensation judge and the director shall have the power to preserve and enforce order during hearings; administer oaths; issue subpoenas to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses, the production of books, papers, documents and other evidence or the taking of depositions before a designated individual competent to administer oaths; examine witnesses; enter noncriminal sanctions for misconduct; and do all things conformable to law that may be necessary to enable the judge or the director to discharge the duties of the judge's or the director's office effectively.\n\nC. In addition to the noncriminal sanctions that may be ordered by the workers' compensation judge or the director, any person committing any of the following acts in a proceeding before a workers' compensation judge or the director may be held accountable for the person's conduct in accordance with the provisions of Subsection D of this section:\n\n(1) disobedience of or resistance to any lawful order or process;\n\n(2) misbehavior during a hearing or so near the place of the hearing as to obstruct it;\n\n(3) failure to produce any pertinent book, paper or document after having been ordered to do so;\n\n(4) refusal to appear after having been subpoenaed;\n\n(5) refusal to take the oath or affirmation as a witness; or\n\n(6) refusal to be examined according to law.\n\nD. The director may certify to the district court of the district in which the acts were committed the facts constituting any of the acts specified in Paragraphs (1) through (6) of Subsection C of this section. The court shall hold a hearing and, if the evidence so warrants, may punish the offending person in the same manner and to the same extent as for contempt committed before the court, or it may commit the person upon the same conditions as if the doing of the forbidden act had occurred with reference to the process of or in the presence of the court.\n\nHistory:Laws 1986, ch. 22, § 32; 1987, ch. 235, § 48; 1989, ch. 263, § 75; 2001, ch. 87, § 4; 2013, ch. 134, § 8.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective July 1, 2013, removed the requirement that workers' compensation claims be heard in the county in which the injury occurred; deleted former Subsection A, which required that workers' compensation claims be heard in the county in which the injury occurred; and added Subsection A.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective July 1, 2001, added the last sentence in Subsection A.\n\nThe workers' compensation administration has inherent and statutory authority to suspend an attorney from practicing before it.Chavez v. N.M. Workers' Comp. Admin., 2012-NMCA-060, 280 P.3d 927.\n\nSuspension of an attorney from practicing before the workers' compensation administration.— Where the director of the worker's compensation administration proposed to assess administrative penalties against an attorney who practiced before the workers' compensation administration for seventeen violations of the Worker's Compensation Act and rules; the parties entered into a stipulated agreement which provided that if the attorney violated the terms of the stipulated agreement, a stipulated order which suspended the attorney from practice before the workers' compensation administration would be filed; and the attorney violated the terms of the stipulated agreement and was suspended from practicing before the workers' compensation administration, the workers' compensation administration had authority to suspend the attorney from practicing before it and the suspension did not infringe upon the exclusive authority of the supreme court to discipline attorneys because the workers' compensation administration took no action against the attorney's status as an attorney as such.Chavez v. N.M. Workers' Comp. Admin., 2012-NMCA-060, 280 P.3d 927.\n\nSanction of an attorney exceeded the workers' compensation administration's authority.— Where a stipulated order suspending an attorney from practicing before the workers' compensation administration prohibited the attorney from generating any fees associated with worker's compensation matters, the prohibition exceeded the worker's compensation administration's authority to control proceedings before it and infringed upon the supreme court's exclusive jurisdiction to discipline attorneys.Chavez v.

When matters in dispute cannot be resolved by informal conference or other techniques, the director shall transmit a copy of the claim to the other parties with notice to respond by written answer. The other parties shall respond with a written answer within twenty days after receiving a notice or within such extension of that time as the director may allow. If no timely answer is filed by a party after notice, a workers' compensation judge may, if he determines it to be appropriate, grant the relief sought against that party. However, if, in order to enable the workers' compensation judge to enter an order and carry out its effect, it is necessary to take an account, determine the amount of benefits due, establish the truth of any claims by evidence or make an investigation of any matter, the workers' compensation judge may conduct such hearings as he deems necessary and proper.\n\nB. A hearing shall be held for determining the questions at issue within sixty days of the filing of the answer. All parties in interest shall be given at least twenty days' notice of the hearing and of the issues to be heard, served personally or by mail. Following the presentation of the evidence, the workers' compensation judge shall determine the questions at issue and file the decision with the director within thirty days, unless the time for filing the decision is extended by the mutual agreement of the parties. At the time of filing, a certified copy of the decision shall be sent by first class mail to all interested parties at the last known address of each. The decision of the workers' compensation judge shall be made in the form of a compensation order, appropriately titled to show its purpose and containing a report of the case, findings of fact and conclusions of law and, if appropriate, an order for the payment of benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act [Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978] or the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law [52-3-1 NMSA 1978].\n\nC. The decision of the workers' compensation judge shall be final and conclusive as to all matters adjudicated by him upon the expiration of the thirtieth day after a copy of the decision has been mailed to the parties, unless prior to that day a party in interest seeks judicial review of the decision pursuant to Section 52-5-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nD. All hearings before the workers' compensation judge shall be open to the public. The director shall by regulation provide for the preparation of a record of each hearing.\n\nE. The director may authorize a workers' compensation judge or his duly authorized representative to enter at any reasonable time the premises where an injury or death has occurred and to make such examination of any tool, appliance, process, machinery or environmental or other condition as may be relevant to a determination of the cause and circumstances of the injury, disablement or death.\n\nF. The testimony of any witness may be taken by deposition or interrogatories according to the rules of civil procedure for the district courts and may be taken before any workers' compensation judge or any person authorized to take testimony, but discovery procedure shall be conducted only upon the workers' compensation judge's findings that good cause exists. The cost and expense of any discovery procedure allowed by the workers' compensation judge shall be paid as provided in Section 52-1-54 NMSA 1978. No costs shall be charged, taxed or collected by the workers' compensation judge except fees for witnesses who testify under subpoena. The witnesses shall be allowed the same fee for attendance and mileage as is fixed by the law in civil actions, except that the workers' compensation judge may assess against the employer the fees allowed any expert witness, as provided in Section 38-6-4 NMSA 1978, whose examination of the claimant, report or hearing attendance the workers' compensation judge deems necessary for resolution of matters at issue.\n\nHistory:Laws 1986, ch. 22, § 33; 1987, ch. 235, § 49; 1989, ch. 263, § 76; 1993, ch. 193, § 11.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, substituted \"as provided in Section 52-1-54 NMSA 1978\" for \"by the employer, and in no event shall an unsuccessful claimant be responsible for the cost and expense of any discovery procedure\" in the second sentence of Subsection F.\n\nAttorney fees.— Nothing in the language of Section 52-5-7B NMSA 1978 indicates that it applies to subsequent orders awarding attorney fees.Trujillo v. Hilton of Santa Fe, 1993-NMCA-005, 115 N.M. 398, 851 P.2d 1065,rev'd on other grounds, 1993-NMSC-017, 115 N.M. 397, 851 P.2d 1064.\n\nDiscovery.— The statute directs that discovery shall be conducted only upon the hearing officer's findings that good cause exists.Cantrell v. W & C Contracting Co., 1991-NMCA-091, 112 N.M. 609, 817 P.2d 1251, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 440, 816 P.2d 509.\n\n\"Cost and expense\".— The words \"cost and expense\" in Subsection F also permit the workers' compensation judge to allow a reasonable fee charged by an expert witness in necessarily reviewing records or otherwise preparing to testify by deposition.Cantrell v. W & C Contracting Co., 1991-NMCA-091, 112 N.M. 609, 817 P.2d 1251, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 440, 816 P.2d 509.\n\nThe words \"cost and expense,\" as used in Subsection F of this section, have been interpreted to include the actual costs of taking a deposition, such as stenographer and reporter fees.Cantrell v.

A decision of a workers' compensation judge is reviewable by the court of appeals in the manner provided for other cases and is subject to stay proceedings as provided by the rules of civil procedure for the district courts, except that the appeal shall be advanced on the calendar and disposed of as promptly as possible.\n\nC.

No docket fee or other costs shall be charged the worker on appeal.\n\nHistory:Laws 1986, ch. 22, § 34; 1989, ch. 263, § 77.\n\nFinal order.— A compensation order of the workers' compensation administration awarding compensation and medical benefits but not resolving the issue of attorney fees was not a final order for purposes of appeal.Trujillo v.

Pojoaque Tribal Police Dep't, 2010-NMSC-034, 148 N.M. 692, 242 P.3d 259.\n\nWhere petitioner mailed a notice of appeal four days before the filing deadline, but the notice of appeal was filed two days after the filing deadline, the workers' compensation judge did not have authority under Rule 12-601 NMRA to grant petitioner's unopposed motion for an extension of time to file the notice of appeal.Schultz v.

Horror One Prods., 2009-NMSC-006, 145 N.M. 551, 202 P.3d 810.\n\nMotion for reconsideration.— Where defendants filed a motion for reconsideration sixteen days after the workers' compensation judge filed a final order and defendants filed a notice of appeal twenty days after the workers' compensation judge denied the motion, defendants' notice of appeal was timely filed under Section 39-1-1 NMSA 1978 and Rule 12-201 NMRA.Baca v. Los Lunas Cmty. Programs, 2011-NMCA-008, 149 N.M. 198, 246 P.3d 1070.\n\nRule 12-601 NMRA governs over this section.— Rule 12-601 NMRA, which allows appeal within 30 days from the filing, governs over this section, which allows appeal within 30 days from the mailing.Maples v.

Los Alamos Constructors, Inc., 1969-NMCA-005, 79 N.M. 789, 450 P.2d 198.\n\nAppellate review of a workman's (worker's) compensation case requires that the appellate court view the entire record in the light most favorable to support the trial court's findings; considering any reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom to support the findings, and disregarding any inferences to the contrary.Gallegos v. Duke City Lumber Co., 1975-NMCA-039, 87 N.M. 404, 534 P.2d 1116.\n\nIf there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the trial court they will not be disturbed.Moorhead v. Gray Ranch Co., 1977-NMCA-017, 90 N.M. 220, 561 P.2d 493, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 254, 561 P.2d 1347;Marez v.

Schultz & Lindsay Constr. Co., 1968-NMCA-064, 79 N.M. 485, 444 P.2d 996, cert. denied, 79 N.M. 448, 444 P.2d 775.\n\nUnfavorable part of evidence not considered.— Where judgment was rendered for plaintiff in action for compensation, on jury's special findings, part of physician's testimony unfavorable to plaintiff would not be considered on appeal.Robinson v. Mittry Bros., 1939-NMSC-038, 43 N.M. 357, 94 P.2d 99 (decided under former law).\n\nEvidence to be stated as favorably as possible.— Where the sole question on appeal was whether there was substantial evidence of a causal connection between accident and disability, the evidence was to be stated as favorably as possible in support of the special verdict that \"plaintiff's disability, and his suffering from atrophy and his blindness\" were caused \"by an accident.\"Janes v. Aguadero Corp., 1935-NMSC-025, 39 N.M. 159, 42 P.2d 775 (decided under former law).\n\nIn reviewing workmen's (workers') compensation cases an appellate court considers only evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to support the findings.Quintana v. East Las Vegas Mun. Sch. Dist., 1971-NMCA-029, 82 N.M. 462, 483 P.2d 936.\n\nTrial court to weigh all evidence.— It was not the duty of the appellate court to weigh the testimony of the doctors, but rather, the duty of the trier of fact; and although there was testimony of the medical experts from which the trial court might have found other than it did, nevertheless, it was for the trial court, as the fact finder, to evaluate all the evidence and determine where the truth lay.Moorhead v. Gray Ranch Co., 1977-NMCA-017, 90 N.M. 220, 561 P.2d 493, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 254, 561 P.2d 1347.\n\nThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony in compensation hearings are to be determined by the trial court and not by the appellate court. The appellate court may not properly substitute its judgment for that of the trial court as to the credibility of any witness or as to the weight to be given his testimony. It is not for the appellate court to say what testimony should be given credence and what should be disbelieved.Lopez v. Schultz & Lindsay Constr. Co., 1968-NMCA-064, 79 N.M. 485, 444 P.2d 996, cert. denied, 79 N.M. 448, 444 P.2d 775;Marez v.

Duke City Lumber Co., 1975-NMCA-039, 87 N.M. 404, 534 P.2d 1116.\n\nInterest on compensation orders.— A review of the Workers' Compensation Act as a whole demonstrates a legislative intent to apply post-judgement interest to final compensation orders.Sanchez v. Siemens Transmission Sys., 1991-NMCA-028, 112 N.M. 236, 814 P.2d 104,rev'd on other grounds, 1991-NMSC-093, 112 N.M. 533, 817 P.2d 726.\n\nAppeal not dismissed because claimant accepts benefits.— The claimant's appeal should not be dismissed because he accepted benefits under the judgment.Howard v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 1982-NMCA-075, 98 N.M. 184, 646 P.2d 1248, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794.\n\nSubsection B does not provide that appeal for benefit of attorney be freeto the attorney or that the public bear the cost of the appeal.Holloway v.

Lerner's, Inc., 1985-NMSC-022, 102 N.M. 391, 696 P.2d 479.\n\nThe legislature did not intend to permit interlocutory appealsfrom the workers' compensation division, and appellate review is limited to final orders as specified in Subsection A.Sanchez v. Bradbury & Stamm Constr., 1989-NMCA-076, 109 N.M. 47, 781 P.2d 319, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 54, 781 P.2d 782.\n\nNo interlocutory appellate review of nonfinal orders.— Subsection B does not provide statutory authority for interlocutory appellate review of nonfinal administrative orders of the workers' compensation division.Sanchez v. Bradbury & Stamm Constr., 1989-NMCA-076, 109 N.M. 47, 781 P.2d 319, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 54, 781 P.2d 782.\n\nOrder reopening lacked finality to render it appealable.— The order reopening the claim for workmen's (workers') compensation lacked the finality indispensable to render it an appealable order under this section or under Supreme Court Rule 5(2) (now superseded).Davis v. Meadors-Cherry Co., 1957-NMSC-093, 63 N.M. 285, 317 P.2d 901.\n\nOrder opening up judgment in workmen's (workers') compensation case is not final order,but merely interlocutory and not appealable.Davis v. Meadors-Cherry Co., 1957-NMSC-093, 63 N.M. 285, 317 P.2d 901 (decided under former law).\n\nMandamus will lie to determine the proper place of trial,before trial, where great delay and expense would result from pursuing an appeal and where a change in venue was made without authority.State ex rel.

Servs. Dep't, 1976-NMSC-008, 89 N.M. 60, 547 P.2d 65.\n\nIssue whether determination is finding of fact or conclusion of lawis itself a question of law and, therefore, freely reviewable in the supreme court.Edens v. N.M. Health & Soc. Servs. Dep't, 1976-NMSC-008, 89 N.M. 60, 547 P.2d 65.\n\nWhether findings of fact reviewable.— In workmen's (workers') compensation cases findings of fact are reviewable only to the extent of determining whether they are supported by substantial evidence, whereas conclusions of law are freely reviewable.Edens v.

Servs. Dep't, 1976-NMSC-008, 89 N.M. 60, 547 P.2d 65.\n\nReview precluded by failure to file timely request for findings.— The failure of a party to file a timely request for findings of fact and conclusions of law precludes evidentiary review by the court of appeals.Pennington v.

      "heading": "Application for modification of compensation order.",
      "text": "A. Compensation orders are reviewable subject to the conditions stated in this section upon application of any party in interest in accordance with the procedures relating to hearings. The workers' compensation judge, after a hearing, may issue a compensation order to terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, decrease or otherwise properly affect compensation benefits provided by the Workers' Compensation Act [Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978] or the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law [52-3-1 NMSA 1978] or in any other respect, consistent with those acts, modify any previous decision, award or action.\n\nB. A review may be obtained upon application of a party in interest filed with the director at any time within two years after the date of the last payment or the denial of benefits upon the following grounds:\n\n(1) change in condition;\n\n(2) mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect;\n\n(3) clerical error or mistake in mathematical calculations;\n\n(4) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered prior to the issuance of the compensation order;\n\n(5) fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party;\n\n(6) the compensation order is void; or\n\n(7) the compensation order has been satisfied, released or discharged or a prior order upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the order should have prospective application.\n\nHistory:Laws 1986, ch. 22, § 35; 1989, ch. 263, § 78.\n\nCompiler's notes.— For the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law,see52-3-1 NMSA 1978 and compiler's notes thereto.\n\nApplicability.— This section was intended to govern all proceedings before the workers' compensation administration. It would make no sense for the implementing statutes setting forth the procedures of the administration not to apply to every case heard by the administration from the administration's inception; otherwise there would be a gap in the law.Lucero v. Yellow Freight Sys., 1991-NMCA-087, 112 N.M. 662, 818 P.2d 863.\n\nThis section applied where the cause of action arose in October 1986 and claimant filed his claim with the workers' compensation administration on June 25, 1987.Lucero v. Yellow Freight Sys., 1991-NMCA-087, 112 N.M. 662, 818 P.2d 863.\n\nModifications of lump-sum settlements.— The workers' compensation administration has continuing jurisdiction over both modification and enforcement of lump-sum settlement agreements.Cruz v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 1995-NMSC-006, 119 N.M. 301, 889 P.2d 1223.\n\nA compensation order is modifiable even when premised on a lump-sum settlement agreement.Fasso v. Sierra Healthcare Ctr., 1994-NMCA-170, 119 N.M. 132, 888 P.2d 1014.\n\nMistake, surprise or excusable neglect.— Mistake or excusable neglect, as used in Subsection B(2) of this section, does not, as a matter of law, constitute a valid basis to subsequently seek to contest a recommended resolution once the time limits specified in Subsection C of Section 52-5-5 NMSA 1978 have expired.Norman v. Lockheed Eng'g & Science Co., 1991-NMCA-101, 112 N.M. 618, 817 P.2d 1260.\n\nExamination of Subsection C of Section 52-5-5 NMSA 1978 in context with the act as a whole indicates that the legislature intended that a party's failure to timely respond to a recommended resolution would preclude a later attempt to contest the recommended resolution for mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect under Subsection B(2) of this section.Norman v. Lockheed Eng'g & Science Co., 1991-NMCA-101, 112 N.M. 618, 817 P.2d 1260.\n\nTo the extent that the provisions of Subsection C of Section 52-5-5 NMSA 1978 and Subsection B(2) of Section 52-5-9 NMSA 1978 are conflicting, the former section is the more specific and governs.Norman v. Lockheed Eng'g & Science Co., 1991-NMCA-101, 112 N.M. 618, 817 P.2d 1260.\n\nAllowing a party up to two years to assert mistake or excusable neglect as a basis for filing a rejection to the recommended resolution would make a nullity of the time limits in Subsection C of Section 52-5-5 NMSA 1978.Norman v. Lockheed Eng'g & Science Co., 1991-NMCA-101, 112 N.M. 618, 817 P.2d 1260.\n\nSince respondents failed to notify the workers' compensation judge of excusable neglect within the time limit specified in Subsection C of Section 52-5-5 NMSA 1978, they could not subsequently file a rejection to the recommended resolution under the two-year time limit provided in this section.Norman v. Lockheed Eng'g & Science Co., 1991-NMCA-101, 112 N.M. 618, 817 P.2d 1260.\n\nFailure of judge to enter order.— Employer properly sought relief under Subsection B(2), where the judge had apparently intended to enter a compensation order in accordance with what he had orally stated at a prior hearing but, given the fading of memories, had failed to do so.Lucero v. Yellow Freight Sys., 1991-NMCA-087, 112 N.M. 662, 818 P.2d 863.\n\nMistaken acceptance of mediator's recommendation.— An employer who mistakenly notifies the workers' compensation administration of its acceptance of a mediator's recommended resolution may not obtain relief from the binding effect of the recommended resolution pursuant to Subsection B(2) of this section.Medina v. Hunemuller Constr., Inc., 2005-NMCA-123, 138 N.M. 472, 122 P.3d 839.\n\nIncomplete diagnosis as mistake of fact.— An incorrect diagnosis or a complete failure to diagnose an injury constitutes a mutual mistake of fact which can be a sufficient basis for setting aside a settlement agreement.Curliss v. B & C Auto Parts, 1993-NMCA-139, 116 N.M. 668, 866 P.2d 396.\n\nUnder the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the worker's brain injury was not diagnosed until sixteen months after the settlement and the failure to diagnose the injury was based on the failure of the insurer to secure the neurological examination recommended by the university of New Mexico hospital. Furthermore, the worker agreed to the lump sum settlement based on the insurer's negligent misrepresentations regarding the provisions of the New Mexico Workers' Compensation Act. Since the worker entered into the settlement under the mistaken belief that he had suffered no brain injury, the lump sum settlement is set aside for mistake.Curliss v. B & C Auto Parts, 1993-NMCA-139, 116 N.M. 668, 866 P.2d 396.\n\nChange in condition.— The term \"change in condition\" refers to a change in a worker's medical or physical condition.Fasso v. Sierra Healthcare Ctr., 1994-NMCA-170, 119 N.M. 132, 888 P.2d 1014.\n\nA compensation order may be modified under the change in condition criteria of Subsection B(1) even if the compensation order is the result of a recommended resolution following a settlement conference.Fasso v. Sierra Healthcare Ctr., 1994-NMCA-170, 119 N.M. 132, 888 P.2d 1014.\n\nAlthough a change in condition must relate to a worker's physical or medical condition,a change in condition may occur when the worker's physical or medical condition may change due to a worker's election to undergo different treatment.Laughlin v. Convenient Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2013-NMCA-088, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-007.\n\nWorker's condition changed due to worker's election to have surgery.— Where worker filed a petition for partial lump sum payment for debts at a time when worker had elected not to undergo surgery to treat worker's work-related injury; the workers compensation judge determined that worker had reached maximum medical improvement and granted worker a partial lump sum payment for debts; five months later, worker decided to undergo surgery to treat the injury; and worker did not claim that worker's physical condition had changed, the workers compensation judge did not err in determining that worker had a change of condition by electing to undergo surgery and that worker was no longer at maximum medical improvement.Laughlin v. Convenient Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2013-NMCA-088, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-007.\n\nJudicial estoppel and the law-of-the-case did not bar change of position regarding medical improvement.— Where worker filed a petition for partial lump sum payment for debts, claiming that worker's injuries were at maximum medical improvement; at that time, worker had elected not to undergo surgery to treat worker's injuries; the workers compensation judge determined that worker had reached maximum medical improvement and granted worker a partial lump sum payment for debts; five months later, worker decided to undergo surgery to treat the injury and took the position that worker was no longer at maximum medical improvement; and the workers compensation judge determined that worker had a change of condition by electing to undergo surgery and that worker was no longer at maximum medical improvement, neither judicial estoppel nor the law-of-the-case doctrine barred worker's change of position regarding whether worker was at maximum medical improvement despite the worker's compensation judge's previous finding that worker was at maximum medical improvement at the time worker was awarded a lump sum payment for debts.Laughlin v. Convenient Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2013-NMCA-088, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-007.\n\nEvidence not presented to judge not reviewable.— A judicial review of an order from which a worker appeals cannot be based on evidence in a supplemental record on appeal, evidence that had not been presented to the worker's compensation judge at the time the order was issued.Gallegos v. City of Albuquerque, 1993-NMCA-050, 115 N.M. 461, 853 P.2d 163, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 535, 854 P.2d 362.\n\nModification of binding resolution.— A conclusively binding recommendation under Section 52-5-5 NMSA 1978, after the running of the time for contesting the recommendation, is synonymous with and constitutes an \"award\" within the meaning of Subsection A of this section. Thus, jurisdiction vests with the workers' compensation judge (W.C.J.) to modify a conclusively binding recommended resolution under this section, and the W.C.J. erred in concluding that a conclusively binding recommended resolution is not a \"compensation order\" as used in this section.Norman v. Lockheed Eng'g & Science Co., 1991-NMCA-101, 112 N.M. 618, 817 P.2d 1260.\n\nThe grounds for modification listed in Subsection B of this section do not permit a party to file a delayed response to a recommended resolution once the resolution has become final.Norman v. Lockheed Eng'g & Science Co., 1991-NMCA-101, 112 N.M. 618, 817 P.2d 1260.\n\nFailure to respond to recommended resolution.— A party who fails to file a response to a recommended resolution is governed by the time limits of Section 52-5-5C NMSA 1978 when seeking to modify compensation order based on mistake or excusable neglect; when considering other grounds for modification under this section, excluding mistake or excusable neglect, the two-year limitation period of this section applies as with any other compensation order.Fasso v. Sierra Healthcare Ctr., 1994-NMCA-170, 119 N.M. 132, 888 P.2d 1014.\n\nNo abuse of discretion in denying increase.Bustamante v.

In the event of default in the payment of compensation due under a compensation order, the person to whom compensation is payable may, after the thirtieth day from the date on which the compensation became due and before the lapse of one year from that due date, make application for a supplementary compensation order declaring the amount of compensation in default. The application shall be filed with the director, who shall forthwith notify the employer and the issuer of the filing of the application, giving opportunity to be heard in respect of the application. In the absence of an allegation and proof of fraud in the procurement of the compensation order and if the workers' compensation judge determines that payment of compensation is in default, the workers' compensation judge shall make and file a supplementary compensation order declaring the amount of the compensation in default. In case the payment in default is an installment of an award of determinable amount, the workers' compensation judge may, in his discretion, declare the entire balance of the award due. The claimant or workers' compensation judge may file a certified copy of the supplementary compensation order with the clerk of any district court.\n\nB. The applicant or director may thereafter petition such district court solely for the purposes of entry of judgment upon the supplementary compensation order and the imposition of appropriate sanctions, serving notice of the petition on the employer and any other person in default. If the employer maintains no place of business in the state, he shall be deemed to have appointed the superintendent of insurance as his agent for the purpose of acceptance of service of process in all matters under the Workers' Compensation Act [Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978] or the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law [52-3-1 NMSA 1978] or related thereto. The district court shall accept the supplementary compensation order as valid, and shall not review or supplement the findings and conclusions of the workers' compensation judge, other than to enforce the supplementary compensation order and impose appropriate sanctions. The district court shall enter judgment against the person in default for the amount due under the order. No fees shall be required for the filing of a supplementary compensation order, for the petition for judgment, for the entry of judgment or for any enforcement procedure for the judgment. No supersedeas bond shall be granted by any court with respect to a judgment entered under this section.\n\nC.

      "text": "A. It is stated policy for the administration of the Workers' Compensation Act [Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978] and the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law [52-3-1 NMSA 1978] that it is in the best interest of the injured worker or disabled employee that the worker or employee receive benefit payments on a periodic basis. Except as provided in this section, lump-sum payments in exchange for the release of the employer from liability for future payments of compensation or medical benefits shall not be allowed.\n\nB. With the approval of the workers' compensation judge, a worker may elect to receive compensation benefits to which the worker is entitled in a lump sum if the worker has returned to work for at least six months, earning at least eighty percent of the average weekly wage the worker earned at the time of injury or disablement. If a worker receives the benefit income in a lump sum, the worker is not entitled to any additional benefit income for the compensable injury or disablement and the worker shall only receive that portion of the benefit income that is attributable to the impairment rating as determined in Section 52-1-24 NMSA 1978. In making lump-sum payments, the payment due the worker shall not be discounted at a rate greater than a sum equal to the present value of all future payments of compensation computed at a five-percent discount compounded annually.\n\nC. After maximum medical improvement and with the approval of the workers' compensation judge, a worker may elect to receive a partial lump-sum payment of workers' compensation benefits for the sole purpose of paying debts that may have accumulated during the course of the injured or disabled worker's disability.\n\nD. The worker and employer may elect to resolve a claim for injury with a lump-sum payment to the worker for all or a portion of past, present and future payments of compensation benefits, medical benefits or both in exchange for a full and final release or an appropriate release of the employer from liability for such compromised benefits. The proposed lump-sum payment agreement shall be presented to the workers' compensation judge for approval, and a hearing shall be held on the record. The workers' compensation judge shall approve the lump-sum payment agreement if the judge finds that:\n\n(1) a written agreement describing the nature of the proposed settlement has been mutually agreed upon and executed by the worker and the employer;\n\n(2) the worker has been fully informed and understands the terms, conditions and consequences of the proposed settlement;\n\n(3) the lump-sum payment agreement is fair, equitable and provides substantial justice to the worker and employer; and\n\n(4) the lump-sum payment agreement complies with the requirements for approval set forth in Sections 52-5-13 and 52-5-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nE. The workers' compensation judge shall approve a lump-sum payment agreement pursuant to Subsection D of this section by order. Once the agreement has been approved and filed with the clerk of the administration, any further challenge to the terms of the settlement is barred and the lump-sum payment agreement shall not be reopened, set aside or reconsidered nor shall any additional benefits be imposed.\n\nF. If a worker and employer elect to enter into a lump-sum payment agreement pursuant to Subsection D of this section, the limit on attorney fees pursuant to Subsection I of Section 52-1-54 NMSA 1978 shall apply.\n\nG. If an insurer pays a lump-sum payment to an injured or disabled worker without the approval of a workers' compensation judge and if at a later date benefits are due for the injured or disabled worker's claim, the insurer alone shall be liable for that claim and shall not in any manner, including rate determinations and the employer's experience modifier, pass on the cost of the benefits due to the employer.\n\nH. If the compensation benefit to which a worker is entitled is less than fifty dollars ($50.00) per week, any party may petition the workers' compensation judge to consolidate that payment into quarterly installments.\n\nHistory:Laws 1986, ch. 22, § 38; 1987, ch. 235, § 50; 1990 (2nd S.S.), ch. 2, § 57; 1993, ch. 193, § 12; 2003, ch. 259, § 10; 2009, ch. 235, § 1.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, added Subsections D through F and deleted former Subsection F, which provided that periodic compensation payments for disability arising from primary mental impairments or secondary mental impairment shall be paid as incurred and shall not be included in lump-sum payments.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, substituted \"fifty dollars ($50.00)\" for \"twenty-five dollars ($25.00)\" near the middle of Subsection E.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, deleted the former second sentence of Subsection F, which read \"Vocational rehabilitation benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act and the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law shall be paid as incurred and shall not be included in any lump sum payments.\"\n\nThe 1990 (2nd S.S.) amendment,effective January 1, 1991, in Subsection A, inserted \"or disabled employee\", substituted \"Subsections B, C, and D\" for \"Subsection B\", inserted \"not\", and deleted language regarding lump sum payments by agreement or best interest of the parties; added Subsections B to E; and redesignated former Subsection B as Subsection F, inserting therein \"or the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law\".\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nLump sum settlement.— When an employer or insurer and an employee agree to a lump-sum settlement for workers' compensation benefits, and that agreement is reduced to writing and is signed, it becomes \"a binding expression of the parties' intent.\"Rojo v. Loeper Landscaping, Inc., 1988-NMSC-065, 107 N.M. 407, 759 P.2d 194.\n\nDuty of worker's compensation judge to advise worker.— When an employer/insurer solicits a lump sum payment from an unrepresented worker, the worker's compensation judge has an affirmative duty to ensure that the worker understands the lump sum settlement agreement into which he or she is entering.Sommerville v. Southwest Firebird, 2008-NMSC-034, 144 N.M. 396, 188 P.3d 1147.\n\nThe restrictions on lump sum paymentsset forth the in this section do not violate equal protection.Rodriguez v. Scotts Landscaping, 2008-NMCA-046, 143 N.M. 726, 181 P.3d 718.\n\nWhen a worker enters into a final settlement of a workers' compensation claimin exchange for a lump-sum payment of all future benefits, the worker may not proceed with an intentional tort action against the employer.Salazar v. Torres, 2007-NMSC-019, 141 N.M. 559, 158 P.3d 449.\n\nLegislature's policy on lump-sum payments does not deprive employer of due process.— The legislature has established the policy for the award of lump-sum payments by providing that a lump-sum settlement must be in the best interests of the parties entitled to compensation; all parties in interest must have due notice of a hearing; and lastly, that no lump-sum settlement could be made for less than a payment equal to the present value of all future payments of compensation computed at 5% discount, compounded annually. Such an award does not deprive employer of due process of law or equal protection of the law.Livingston v. Loffland Bros., 1974-NMCA-047, 86 N.M. 375, 524 P.2d 991, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 372, 524 P.2d 988.\n\nLegislature's policy favoring periodic over lump sum paymentsin Subsection A of this section also applies to compensation due a deceased worker's dependents under Section 52-1-46 NMSA 1978.Paradiso v. Tipps Equip., 2004-NMCA-009, 134 N.M. 814, 82 P.3d 985, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-001.\n\nNot unconstitutional delegation of authority.— The section awarding lump sum payment to the employee is not an unconstitutional delegation of authority by the legislature and does not deprive the employer of his right to due process of law.Livingston v. Loffland Bros., 1974-NMCA-047, 86 N.M. 375, 524 P.2d 991, cert. denied, 86 N.M. 372, 524 P.2d 988.\n\nAccelerated periodic paymentsare not lump-sum settlements requiring pre-approval by the judge. Therefore, employer was entitled to a credit without discount for advance periodic payments made to worker.Gomez v. Bernalillo Cnty. Clerk's Office, 1994-NMCA-102, 118 N.M. 449, 882 P.2d 40.\n\nLump-sum payment and release agreement effective as waiver of statutory rights.— Lump-sum payment and release agreement which stated, among other things, that claimant would be treated by present physician or his referral for life was a binding contract, and constituted a waiver of employer's right under Section 52-3-15 NMSA 1978 to designate a change in claimant's primary care provider.Ramirez v. Johnny's Roofing, Inc., 1999-NMCA-038, 127 N.M. 83, 977 P.2d 348.\n\nLimitation on release.— Subsections A and B of this section do not allow the release of an employer from liability for further benefit payments in exchange for partial lump-sum payments when worker's condition becomes worse.Souter v. Ancae Heating & Air Conditioning, 2002-NMCA-078, 132 N.M. 608, 52 P.3d 980.\n\nFacilitating the production of income.— The term \"to facilitate the production of income,\" as used in thePadilla v. Frito-Laytest (see annotation this section), does not mean maximizing return on investment.Merrifield v. Auto-Chlor Sys., 1983-NMCA-098, 100 N.M. 263, 669 P.2d 739.\n\nNo lump-sum award of attorney's fees.— Hearing officer did not abuse his discretion in refusing to award attorney's fees in a lump sum payable by employer and, instead, awarding attorney's fees to be paid out of claimant's bi-weekly compensation.Strong v. Sysco Corp./Nobel Sysco, 1989-NMCA-051, 108 N.M. 639, 776 P.2d 1258.\n\nVoluntary payment of maximum compensation benefits over period of timedoes not establish total permanent disability, and such payment is not an admission by the employer of the totality or permanency of any injury.Armijo v. Co-Con Constr. Co., 1978-NMCA-106, 92 N.M. 295, 587 P.2d 442, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 260, 586 P.2d 1089,overruled on other grounds byRaines v. W.A.

Getty Oil Co., 1987-NMCA-002, 105 N.M. 370, 733 P.2d 1andRaines v. W.A. Klinger & Sons, 1988-NMSC-083, 107 N.M. 668, 763 P.2d 684.\n\nRehabilitation is restoration of individual to his greatest potential— physically, mentally, socially and vocationally.Lane v. Levi Strauss & Co., 1979-NMCA-012, 92 N.M. 504, 590 P.2d 652.\n\nTemporary disability is that which lasts for a limited time onlywhile the workman (worker) is undergoing treatment and this classification anticipates that eventually there will be either complete recovery or an impaired bodily condition which is static.Lane v. Levi Strauss & Co., 1979-NMCA-012, 92 N.M. 504, 590 P.2d 652.\n\nThirty-one day period for paying first compensation installment has no applicability to one-year limitation periodwithin which the claimant was required to bring suit after termination of her employment, and the 31-day period could not be tacked on to a one-year limitation.Owens v. Eddie Lu's Fine Apparel, 1980-NMCA-149, 95 N.M. 176, 619 P.2d 852.\n\nFiling separate claim to determine total permanent disability.— This section gave plaintiff the right to file a petition, a separate claim, a separate proceeding, under the Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Act, to determine if he had a case of total permanent disability, and if so, if it was in the best interests of the parties entitled to compensation to grant him a lump-sum award. The purpose of the section was to give a workman (worker) an early opportunity to solve an economic problem.Briscoe v. Hydro Conduit Corp., 1975-NMCA-147, 88 N.M. 568, 544 P.2d 283 (decided under prior law).\n\nII. LUMP SUM PAYMENT.\n\nReturn-to-work lump sum paymentsmay be modified if the worker's physical condition changes.Benny v. Moberg Welding, 2007-NMCA-124, 142 N.M. 501, 167 P.3d 949, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-008, 142 N.M. 435, 166 P.3d 1089.\n\nA worker can receive a partial lump-sum payment for payment of debtswhile pursuing an intentional tort action against the employer.Luna v. Lewis Casing Crews, Inc., 2007-NMSC-020, 141 N.M. 607, 159 P.3d 256.\n\nLump-sum payment exception rather than rule.— Periodic compensation payments are the rule, and lump-sum awards are the exception, and in applying this exception the purpose of workmen's (workers') compensation must be kept in mind, that is the public policy that compensation shall be made in a certain amount, to secure the injured employee against want, and to avoid his becoming a public charge.Arther v. Western Co. of N. Am., 1975-NMCA-082, 88 N.M. 157, 538 P.2d 799, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nThree factors determine an award of lump-sum:(1) total permanent disability; (2) rehabilitation of the workman (worker) and (3) the best interest of the workman (worker).Lane v. Levi Strauss & Co., 1979-NMCA-012, 92 N.M. 504, 590 P.2d 652 (decided under former law).\n\nOnly exceptional circumstances permit lump-sum award.— Lump summing should only be permitted when it appears that exceptional circumstances warrant the departure from the general scheme; however, once a departure is warranted there should be no hesitancy in making a lump-sum award, which may be made either in whole or in part so long as it is made because of exceptional circumstances.Codling v. Aztec Well Servicing Co., 1976-NMCA-044, 89 N.M. 213, 549 P.2d 628.\n\nAs each request for a lump-sum payment is unique, a precise enumeration of what factual ingredients constitute special circumstances is impossible, but in each case which has granted a lump-sum award, a certain factual situation has emerged which, by its quantum and quality of evidence, has convincingly portrayed the existence of exceptional circumstances.Codling v. Aztec Well Servicing Co., 1976-NMCA-044, 89 N.M. 213, 549 P.2d 628.\n\nGenerally, a lump sum is awarded only when present, pressing need is shown, and the spectre of distant deprivation to plaintiff is simply insufficient to warrant a lump-sum award.Zamora v. CDK Contracting Co., 1987-NMCA-093, 106 N.M. 309, 742 P.2d 521, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 353, 742 P.2d 1058.\n\nIt was error to award a claimant lump-sum benefits, when such a payment would create an undue risk that the worker would end up on the welfare rolls well before the periodic payments would have terminated.Riesenecker v. Arkansas Best Freight Sys., 1990-NMCA-059, 110 N.M. 654, 798 P.2d 1040,vacated on other grounds, 1990-NMCA-100, 110 N.M. 451, 796 P.2d 1147 (decided under prior law).\n\nExceptional circumstances necessary for lump-sum award.— Where maximum compensation benefits for disability are not being paid, a suit to establish disability may be brought, and if total permanent disability is established, a lump-sum may be awarded where exceptional circumstances warrant a departure from payments of compensation in installments.Minnerup v. Stewart Bros. Drilling Co., 1979-NMCA-125, 93 N.M. 561, 603 P.2d 300, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 629, 614 P.2d 546 (1980),overruled on other grounds byRaines v. W.A. Klinger & Sons, 1988-NMSC-083, 107 N.M. 668, 763 P.2d 684.\n\nLump-sum payments are justified only when exceptional circumstances exist.Woodson v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 1985-NMSC-018, 102 N.M. 333, 695 P.2d 483.\n\nEach case considered independently in determining lump sum.— Each request for a lump-sum payment stands or falls on its own merits, and each case must be considered according to the evidence produced to determine whether sufficient \"special circumstances\" exist to bring the request within the exception of Subsection B.Padilla v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 1981-NMCA-154, 97 N.M. 354, 639 P.2d 1208, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nSpecial circumstances for lump sum award.— A precise enumeration of what factual ingredients constitute special circumstances is impossible; the propriety of a lump-sum award in each case stands or falls on its own merits.Woodson v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 1985-NMSC-018, 102 N.M. 333, 695 P.2d 483.\n\nNo limitation on full lump-sum payments in Subsection C.— The different statutory provisions of this section applicable to full and partial lump sum payments, represent a legislative balancing of competing interests. Subsection C recognizes the economic difficulties faced by injured and disabled workers who, because of injury or disability, are unable to pay certain debts and authorizes a lump sum payment, rather than periodic payment, if necessary to avoid extreme hardship. Because the purpose of such a payment is need, rather than convenience, there is no reason to reduce benefits to the level calculated based solely on impairment.Cabazos v. Calloway Constr., 1994-NMCA-091, 118 N.M. 198, 879 P.2d 1217, cert. denied, 119 N.M. 168, 889 P.2d 203.\n\nPeriodic compensation payments are the ruleand lump-sum awards are the exception; because lump-summing is a departure it should only be permitted when it appears that exceptional circumstances warrant the departure.Lamont v. N.M. Military Inst., 1979-NMCA-047, 92 N.M. 804, 595 P.2d 774, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078;Spidle v. Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corp., 1981-NMSC-058, 96 N.M. 290, 629 P.2d 1219.\n\nPeriodic payments ordinarily serve the policy of this article; the award of a lump sum is the exception.Padilla v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 1981-NMCA-154, 97 N.M. 354, 639 P.2d 1208, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nSubsection C of this section enacted into law what had been treated in case law as an exception to the periodic payment provision of the workers' compensation law.Jackson v. K & M Constr., 2004-NMCA-082, 136 N.M. 94, 94 P.3d 837, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-007, 136 N.M. 452, 99 P.3d 1164.\n\nUnaccrued disability benefits for lump sum payment of debt.— In enacting Subsection C of this section, there is no intent on the part of the legislature to call upon unaccrued disability benefits for the lump sum payment of debt when the worker is no longer disabled, due to his or her death, and, as a result, there no longer exist any period payments due from which a lump sum payment for debt would be deducted.Jackson v. K & M Constr., 2004-NMCA-082, 136 N.M. 94, 94 P.3d 837, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-007, 136 N.M. 452, 99 P.3d 1164.\n\nLump-sum award only where compensation right previously established.— Section 52-1-56 NMSA 1978 and this section authorize lump-sum awards only where the right to compensation has been previously established. Where defendants in their answer admitted death from injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, and contested only the propriety of a lump-sum award, their admission of liability sufficiently established plaintiff's right to compensation and authorized a lump-sum award under the section.Arther v. Western Co. of N. Am., 1975-NMCA-082, 88 N.M. 157, 538 P.2d 799, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nObtaining lump sum award through court proceeding.— Lump-sum awards may be obtained through court proceedings only where the right to compensation has been previously established.Neumann v. A.S. Horner, Inc., 1983-NMCA-039, 99 N.M. 603, 661 P.2d 503,overruled on other grounds byRaines v. W.A. Klinger & Sons, 1988-NMSC-083, 107 N.M. 668, 763 P.2d 684.\n\nApplication of statute of limitations to lump-sum credit.— Worker's compensation judge did not abuse her discretion in applying a credit for lump-sum payments previously made to claimant to a period of time during which employer had failed to pay benefits, even though the employer had initially stopped paying benefits more than one year prior to claimant's action.West v. Home Care Res., 1999-NMCA-037, 127 N.M. 78, 976 P.2d 1030.\n\nMatter is vested in trial court's discretion whether to grant lump-sum award.Boughton v. W. Nuclear, Inc., 1983-NMCA-052, 99 N.M. 723, 663 P.2d 382.\n\nDiscretion not abused in awarding widow benefits for house and daughter's care.— The trial court does not abuse its discretion in awarding a widow worker's compensation benefits in a lump sum to purchase a house and raise her daughter in a home (rather than an apartment) environment, to attend a nursing school, and for future medical care for her daughter's physical condition.Boughton v. Western Nuclear, Inc., 1983-NMCA-052, 99 N.M. 723, 663 P.2d 382.\n\nLump-sum awarded only if it promotes public policy.— Proof that a lump-sum award is in the best interest of the recipient will not justify a court in ordering such an award if to do so would undermine the public policy which the statute is intended to promote.Spidle v. Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corp., 1981-NMSC-058, 96 N.M. 290, 629 P.2d 1219;Boughton v. Western Nuclear, Inc., 1983-NMCA-052, 99 N.M. 723, 663 P.2d 382.\n\nClaimant's burden to show lump-sum award in his best interests.— A lump-sum award should be calculated on a sound annuity basis and should not be permitted for the purpose of beating the actuarial tables; thus the claimant has the burden of showing that it is in his best interest and that the lack of lump summing would create a manifest hardship where relief is essential to protect claimant and his family from want, privation or to facilitate the production of income or to help in a rehabilitation program, and depending on the circumstances, the payment of debts may or may not be an important factor.Codling v. Aztec Well Servicing Co., 1976-NMCA-044, 89 N.M. 213, 549 P.2d 628 (decided under former law).\n\nPetitioner's burden of proof.— A petitioner for a lump-sum award has the burden of showing that it is in his best interest and that the failure to award a lump sum would create a manifest hardship where relief is essential to protect the claimant and his family from want or privation, to facilitate the production of income for the claimant or to help the claimant in a rehabilitation program.Padilla v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 1981-NMCA-154, 97 N.M. 354, 639 P.2d 1208, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039;Boughton v. W. Nuclear, Inc., 1983-NMCA-052, 99 N.M. 723, 663 P.2d 382;Woodson v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 1985-NMSC-018, 102 N.M. 333, 695 P.2d 483 (decided under former law).\n\nExpert testimony not required.— There is no mandatory requirement in the workmen's (workers') compensation law that the claimant produce expert testimony at a hearing to obtain an advance payment of compensation.Padilla v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 1981-NMCA-154, 97 N.M. 354, 639 P.2d 1208, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039.\n\nSufficient findings to support lump-sum award.— Trial court's findings that the financial interests of plaintiff, a 21-year-old widow who had been married to her deceased husband about one month, and had no children, would be best served by a lump-sum settlement because of its investment potential and because she could remarry the day after a lump-sum settlement, or die the day after a lump-sum settlement, without losing any future payments, was not sufficient to support a lump-sum award.Arther v. Western Co. of N. Am., 1975-NMCA-082, 88 N.M. 157, 538 P.2d 799, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nLump-sum benefits were properly awarded where the court was concerned that the mothers of the dependent children of the deceased would mismanage the funds, and a lump-sum award was the best way to secure the services of a conservator at a reasonable cost.Sowders v. MFG Drilling Co., 1985-NMCA-081, 103 N.M. 267, 705 P.2d 172.\n\nStipulated compensation order that failed to comply with approval process was invalid and unenforceable.— Where, in 2004, the parties entered into a stipulated compensation order (SCO) to settle a dispute regarding worker's entitlement to workers' compensation benefits as the result of an accident and injuries to worker's back that occurred in 2002, and where there was no hearing by the workers' compensation judge (WCJ) to approve the provisions of the SCO or otherwise confirm worker's knowledge of the partial lump-sum settlement or any of the material facts contained therein, and where, in 2014, employer filed a motion for a supplemental compensation order (MSCO), the WCJ erred in granting the MSCO and in approving the SCO under 52-5-13 and -14 NMSA 1978, because the SCO was not in compliance with 52-5-12(C) NMSA 1978, and therefore the WCJ had no authority to approve the SCO containing a partial lump-sum payment of benefits; the SCO was invalid and unenforceable.Baca v. State, 2017-NMCA-076, cert. denied.\n\nPayment of debts accumulated during disability.— Only those debts that have been added during the worker's disability may be paid off with a lump sum; other debts are not eligible for lump-sum payment.Carrasco v. Phelps Dodge/Chino Mines, 1995-NMCA-001, 119 N.M. 347, 890 P.2d 408.\n\nThe renewal of a promissory note does not constitute an accumulation of debt within the scope of this section.Carrasco v. Phelps Dodge/Chino Mines, 1995-NMCA-001, 119 N.M. 347, 890 P.2d 408.\n\nPremature lump-sum award.— In the present case, because the worker had not returned to work for six months earning 80% of his average weekly wage, he did not qualify for a full lump-sum payment under Subsection B. Therefore, the employer could not be required to pay the full amount of the remaining disability as determined at the time of the hearing, notwithstanding the fact that the payment was denominated as partial. Subsection C does allow, after maximum medical improvement has been achieved and with the approval of the judge, a partial lump-sum payment for the sole purpose of paying debts that may have accumulated during the course of the injured or disabled worker's disability. However, the judge here did not award a partial lump-sum payment; he awarded full payment. Therefore, Subsection C was not in fact properly utilized and the award as made must be set aside.Quintana v. Ilfelds, 1993-NMCA-158, 116 N.M. 836, 867 P.2d 1218.\n\nReview of lump-sum award.— Where the district court determines that a lump-sum payment is in the best interest of the claimant and the public, a reviewing court will not disturb the award in the absence of an abuse of discretion.Spidle v. Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corp., 1981-NMSC-058, 96 N.M. 290, 629 P.2d 1219.\n\nModification of benefits award.— A worker may, pursuant to Section 52-1-56 NMSA 1978, seek an increase in his compensation based on change in condition at any time during that statutory benefits period under Section 52-1-42 NMSA 1978, even if, as a result of receiving partial lump-sum payments for debt pursuant to Subsection C, the worker has received the monetary equivalent of the benefits allowed in a compensation order before the benefits period expires.Souter v. Ancae Heating & Air Conditioning, 2002-NMCA-078, 132 N.M. 608, 52 P.3d 980.\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico law relating to workmen's compensation, see 13 N.M.L.

Tipps Equip., 2004-NMCA-009, 134 N.M. 814, 82 P.3d 985, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-001.\n\nFailure to ensure worker understood agreement.— Where worker, who was not represented by counsel, filed a petition for lump sum payment and the workers' compensation judge approved the petition without a hearing, the lump sum settlement was unenforceable because the workers' compensation judge failed to perform the judge's affirmative duty to ensure that the worker understood the lump sum settlement agreement.Sommerville v. Southwest Firebird, 2008-NMSA-034, 144 N.M. 396, 188 P.3d 1147.\n\nStipulated compensation order that failed to comply with approval process was invalid and unenforceable.— Where, in 2004, the parties entered into a stipulated compensation order (SCO) to settle a dispute regarding worker's entitlement to workers' compensation benefits as the result of an accident and injuries to worker's back that occurred in 2002, and where there was no hearing by the workers' compensation judge (WCJ) to approve the provisions of the SCO or otherwise confirm worker's knowledge of the partial lump-sum settlement or any of the material facts contained therein, and where, in 2014, employer filed a motion for a supplemental compensation order (MSCO), the WCJ erred in granting the MSCO and in approving the SCO under 52-5-13 and -14 NMSA 1978, because the SCO was not in compliance with 52-5-12(C) NMSA 1978, and therefore the WCJ had no authority to approve the SCO containing a partial lump-sum payment of benefits; the SCO was invalid and unenforceable.Baca v. State, 2017-NMCA-076, cert. denied.\n\nWritten agreements binding.— When an employer or insurer and an employee agree to a lump-sum settlement for workers' compensation benefits, and that agreement is reduced to writing and is signed, it becomes a binding expression of the parties' intent; a lump-sum settlement agreement, however, must be submitted to the workers' compensation administration for approval.Cruz v.

In a circumstance covered by Subsection A of this section, the receipt of compensation from the employer shall operate as an assignment to the employer or his insurer, guarantor or surety of any cause of action, to the extent of payment by the employer to or on behalf of the worker for compensation or any other benefits to which the worker was entitled under the Workers' Compensation Act or the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Law and that were occasioned by the injury or disablement, that the worker or his legal representative or others may have against any other party for the injury or disablement.\n\nC.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nSection was not expanded to recognize an independent rightto bring suit against a third-party tortfeasor.Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Salgado, 2005-NMCA-144, 138 N.M. 685, 125 P.3d 664.\n\nThis section provides a derivative right.Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Salgado, 2005-NMCA-144, 138 N.M. 685, 125 P.3d 664.\n\nThe legislature intended that(1) an injured workman (worker) shall not be denied the right to recover damages caused by the negligence of a third person because he has received workmen's (workers') compensation benefits for the same injury, but, (2) he shall not be allowed to retain both the compensation benefits and the damages recovered from such third person, and (3) the section, by operation of law, assigns to the employer so much of the judgment or payments received from such third person as the injured workman (worker) received as compensation benefits.Reed v. Styron, 1961-NMSC-119, 69 N.M. 262, 365 P.2d 912.\n\nThis section plainly intends to prevent dual recovery,and an erroneous selection or election of remedy should not be construed as forever terminating the right to receive the benefits of the Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Act. The employer, or its insurer, had the right to reimbursement of any amounts paid the employee, in the event the employee successfully sued a third party but the right to indemnity is not such a right as should operate to destroy the benefits of the workmen's (workers') compensation statute.Brown v. Arapahoe Drilling Co., 1962-NMSC-051, 70 N.M. 99, 370 P.2d 816.\n\nPurpose of Subsection C.— The plain language of the statute is evidence that the legislature intended to prevent an employee's double recovery from discrete and independent insurance coverage provided by the employer.Draper v. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co., 1994-NMSC-002, 116 N.M. 775, 867 P.2d 1157.\n\nII. RECOVERY FROM THIRD PARTY.\n\nWorkman (Worker) is indispensable party in suit to recover damagesfrom a third party tort-feasor under this section even though the employer's insurer has paid the employee under the Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Act because it is the workman (worker) who has the claim against the third party.Herrera v. Springer Corp., 1973-NMCA-041, 85 N.M. 6, 508 P.2d 1303,rev'd on other grounds, 1973-NMSC-057, 85 N.M. 201, 510 P.2d 1072.\n\nCompensation insurer not indispensable party to workmen's (workers') suit.— As the right to collect is in the workman (worker), the compensation insurer does not own the right to enforce liability and cannot release the third party from liability, and therefore is not an indispensable party to the workmen's (workers') suit.Herrera v. Springer Corp., 1973-NMCA-041, 85 N.M. 6, 508 P.2d 1303,rev'd on other grounds, 1973-NMSC-057, 85 N.M. 201, 510 P.2d 1072.\n\nThe underlying concern with third party actions isthat the claimant will receive a \"double recovery.\"Transp. Indem. Co. v. Garcia, 1976-NMCA-059, 89 N.M. 342, 552 P.2d 473, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 9, 558 P.2d 621.\n\nProvisions for assignments valid.— Provisions of the Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Act providing for assignments of personal injury causes of action are valid.Motto v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 1969-NMSC-178, 81 N.M. 35, 462 P.2d 620.\n\nAn insured can, through a subrogation clause, assign his cause of action, but the insured must abide by the terms of the clause in order to collect.Motto v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 1969-NMSC-178, 81 N.M. 35, 462 P.2d 620.\n\nAssignment of action.— An employee who receives compensation from employer's insurer for an injury does not assign his entire cause of action against a third party for damages. This question is determined by the Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Act.Kandelin v. Lee Moor Contracting Co., 1933-NMSC-058, 37 N.M. 479, 24 P.2d 731.\n\nAlthough the workmen's (workers') compensation statutes do not create a right of subrogation or assignment in an insurer, but merely the right to reimbursement, a claimant may voluntarily assign his rights to an insurer which may bring an action in its own name against the party responsible for the workmen's (workers') injuries.Seaboard Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Kurth, 1980-NMCA-112, 96 N.M. 631, 633 P.2d 1229, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 426, 622 P.2d 1046 (1981).\n\nRecovery from third-party not a bar to benefits.— Prosecution to judgment of a third-party action is not a bar to subsequent collection of workers' compensation benefits; if there is a problem with a satisfaction of the third-party claim, it does not go to double recovery, it goes to the amount of reimbursement or credit to which the employer is entitled.Montoya v. AKAL Sec., Inc., 1992-NMSC-056, 114 N.M. 354, 838 P.2d 971.\n\nThe decision inMontoya v. AKAL Sec., Inc., 1992-NMSC-056, 114 N.M 354, 838 P.2d 971, applied retroactively to allow an employee to continue to recover compensation benefits notwithstanding her settlement of a third-party tort claim.Gutierrez v. City of Albuquerque, 1995-NMCA-139, 121 N.M. 172, 909 P.2d 732,rev'd on other grounds, 1998-NMSC-027, 125 N.M. 643, 964 P.2d 807.\n\nDebtor-creditor relationship where recovery against third party.— This section creates a conditional debtor-creditor relationship. That condition is operative only if a third party recovery is made by the claimant. Accordingly, the carrier cause of action, upon the happening of the condition, is against the claimant and not the third party.Transport Indem. Co. v. Garcia, 1976-NMCA-059, 89 N.M. 342, 552 P.2d 473, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 9, 558 P.2d 621.\n\nCarrier charged with proportionate share of costs for action against third party.— Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Acts are to be liberally interpreted in favor of the workman (worker). Where no guidance is given, fundamental fairness must be the guidelines. In the instant case, it was the claimant who bore the burden of the expense and risk of litigation of the third party action. It would be unduly burdensome on the claimant to pay all of the expenses and by the same token it would unjustly enhance the economic position of the carrier not to assess a portion of the costs against it. Accordingly, the carrier should be charged with his proportionate share of the costs.Transport Indem. Co. v. Garcia, 1976-NMCA-059, 89 N.M. 342, 552 P.2d 473, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 9, 558 P.2d 621.\n\nEmployer's negligence as affecting his action against third party.— This statute omits any mention of the situation where negligence of the employer is to be considered as affecting the employer's right of action against a third party; thus, there is but one cause of action, and the employer or his insurer is specifically granted reimbursement in this single cause of action.Royal Indem. Co. v. Southern Cal. Petroleum Corp., 1960-NMSC-053, 67 N.M. 137, 353 P.2d 358.\n\nConsolidation of actions.— Where an insurer's cause of action has been consolidated with employee's, against party causing employee's injury, the vacation of such order of consolidation is erroneous.Kandelin v. Lee Moor Contracting Co., 1933-NMSC-058, 37 N.M. 479, 24 P.2d 731.\n\nEmployer's share of attorneys' fees.— Determination of an employer's proportionate share of attorney fees and costs incurred in an action against a third-party tortfeasor must take into consideration both compensation benefits already paid and relief from future workers' compensation liability.Trujillo v. Sonic Drive-In/Merritt, 1996-NMCA-106, 122 N.M. 359, 924 P.2d 1371.\n\nRecovery of advanced litigation expenses by employer.— Reimbursement by the worker of a proportionate share of litigation expenses advanced by the employer in an action against a third-party tortfeasor was appropriate under Subsection B.Trujillo v. Sonic Drive-In/Merritt, 1996-NMCA-106, 122 N.M. 359, 924 P.2d 1371.\n\nResolution of issues between workman (worker) and third party controlsboth the rights and liabilities of the compensation insurer as if the workman (worker) obtains a settlement, or recovers from the tort-feasor; the right to reimbursement is established, and if the workman (worker) fails to recover, the right to reimbursement is lost.Herrera v. Springer Corp., 1973-NMCA-041, 85 N.M. 6, 508 P.2d 1303,rev'd on other grounds, 1973-NMSC-057, 85 N.M. 201, 510 P.2d 1072.\n\nInsurance company as party plaintiff.— If an insurance company, claiming a right to reimbursement for funds expended, and the insurance carrier for the defendants, is not allowed to become a party plaintiff, it will forfeit its rights to reimbursement under this section.Varney v. Taylor, 1963-NMSC-036, 71 N.M. 444, 379 P.2d 84.\n\nInsurance company can intervene.— An insurance company, claiming a right to reimbursement for funds expended, can intervene as a party-plaintiff when the same company is the insurance carrier for the defendants only under such conditions as would properly protect all the parties to the litigation.Varney v. Taylor, 1963-NMSC-036, 71 N.M. 444, 379 P.2d 84.\n\nInsurance company bound by judgment.— Whether or not an insurance company, claiming a right to reimbursement for funds expended, can intervene as a party plaintiff in a suit brought by decedent's survivors against defendant for which company is also the insurance carrier, it will be bound by the judgment in such case.Varney v. Taylor, 1963-NMSC-036, 71 N.M. 444, 379 P.2d 84.\n\nInsurance company not compelled to be party.— The workmen's (workers') compensation insurance company is not \"compelled by law\" to be a party in an action for damages against a third party.Schulte v. Baber Well Servicing Co., 1982-NMCA-036, 98 N.M. 547, 650 P.2d 831, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 478, 649 P.2d 1391.\n\nAssessment of costs against intervenor insurer.— It is within the informed discretion of the trial court to assess costs against an insurer who intervenes in the worker's suit against an alleged tortfeasor.Eskew v. National Farmers Union Ins. Co., 2000-NMCA-093, 129 N.M. 667, 11 P.3d 1229.\n\nCarrier cannot intervene until damages awarded.— The court erred by granting a worker's compensation carrier leave to file a complaint-in-intervention for reimbursement and by ordering the carrier's intervention into an underlying wrongful death suit against a third-party defendant prior to a judgment for damages being awarded the plaintiff.Fernandez v. Ford Motor Co., 1994-NMCA-063, 118 N.M. 100, 879 P.2d 101, cert. denied, 118 N.M. 90, 879 P.2d 91\n\nImmunity of co-employee.— The immunity of an employee for an injury done to a fellow employee is not limited to negligent injury; rather, the provisions of the Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Act accord immunity for all causes of action, all common-law rights and remedies, for negligence or wrong including intentional torts.Gallegos v. Chastain, 1981-NMCA-014, 95 N.M. 551, 624 P.2d 60,overruled byDelgado v. Phelps Dodge Chino, Inc., 2001-NMSC-034, 131 N.M. 272, 34 P.3d 1148.\n\nWorkman (Worker) giving release to third person.— A workman (worker) injured by a third person while employed is at liberty to settle with the third person for any sum, even less than he would have received under this act, but if he does, he may not recover compensation. A release to the third person gives nothing to be assigned to the employer.White v. N.M. Hwy. Comm'n, 1938-NMSC-060, 42 N.M. 626, 83 P.2d 457.\n\nApplicable statute of limitations.— Where a workers' compensation insurer settles with an injured worker, receives an assignment of his negligence cause of action to the extent of the payment, and seeks reimbursement from a third party, the relevant statute of limitations is not Section 37-1-4 (four-year period), which governs unspecified actions, but Section 37-1-8 (three-year period), which governs actions for personal injury, which begins to run on a subrogated insurer's action against a third-party tortfeasor at the same time that the statute of limitations would begin to run on an action by the insured, or his personal representative in the event of the death of the insured.American Gen. Fire & Cas. Co. v. J.T. Constr. Co., 1987-NMCA-094, 106 N.M. 195, 740 P.2d 1179.\n\nIII. REIMBURSEMENT.\n\nThis is a reimbursement statute and there is but a single cause of action in employee,even though a part of the recovery is to be paid to the employer or his insurer.Royal Indem. Co. v. Southern Cal. Petroleum Corp., 1960-NMSC-053, 67 N.M. 137, 353 P.2d 358.\n\nThis section is a reimbursement statute and provides a right of reimbursement for benefits paid under the Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Act by an employer who is negligent or whose negligence concurs with that of a third person in causing the injury. There is only a single cause of action in the employee against the third person and the right of the compensation insurance carrier to reimbursement follows the success or failure of the employee against such third person.Reed v. Styron, 1961-NMSC-119, 69 N.M. 262, 365 P.2d 912.\n\nThe workers' compensation carrier's claim for reimbursement of proceeds paid is against the worker and not the third party.St. Joseph Healthcare Sys. v. Travelers Cos., 1995-NMCA-020, 119 N.M. 603, 893 P.2d 1007.\n\nThe insurers of the third-party tortfeasors had no affirmative duty to reimburse a compensation insurance carrier directly when disbursing settlement proceeds even though the insurers knew of the compensation carrier's rights; the latter's only statutory right is the right to reimbursement from the settlement proceeds, to be enforced against the employee.St. Joseph Healthcare Sys. v. Travelers Cos., 1995-NMCA-020, 119 N.M. 603, 893 P.2d 1007.\n\nThis section provides a right for reimbursement that derives from a worker's right to recover damages from a negligent third party.Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Salgado, 2005-NMCA-144, 138 N.M. 685, 125 P.3d 664.\n\nFormula for calculating employer reimbursement.The employer's extent of reimbursement for compensation paid is determined by identifying the nature and purpose of the payments made by the employer and comparing the elements of the tort recovery with those which are duplicative of the employer's compensation payments; the total of the duplicative payments is the amount which must be reimbursed.Paradiso v. Tipps Equip., 2004-NMCA-009, 134 N.M. 814, 82 P.3d 985, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-001.\n\nReceipt of benefits no bar to action against third-party.— Although the estate of the deceased has received workmen's (workers') compensation benefits from the lessor by means of a settlement agreement, the plaintiff is not denied the right to bring suit against a third-party tort-feasor; moreover, the lessor's compensation carrier may gain the right of reimbursement from the carrier-lessee depending on the success or failure of the plaintiff at trial.Matkins v. Zero Refrigerated Lines, Inc., 1979-NMCA-095, 93 N.M. 511, 602 P.2d 195.\n\nRecovery from third-party tort-feasor for full loss suffered.— Where a claimant has sought relief from a third-party tort-feasor, the amount of the recovery is for the full loss or detriment suffered by the injured party and makes him financially whole.Seminara v. Frank Seminara Pontiac-Buick, Inc., 1980-NMCA-136, 95 N.M. 22, 618 P.2d 366.\n\nClaimant receiving verdict from third party barred from subsequent compensation claims.— Where claimant elects to sue third-party tort-feasor and receives a verdict with a judgment of zero damages, he is then barred from making a subsequent workmen's (workers') compensation claim.Seminara v. Frank Seminara Pontiac-Buick, Inc., 1980-NMCA-136, 95 N.M. 22, 618 P.2d 366.\n\nHaving been made \"financially whole\" by a damage award, the plaintiff may not retain both compensation benefits and the damages recovered.Strickland v. Roosevelt Cnty. Rural Elec. Coop., 1982-NMCA-184, 99 N.M. 335, 657 P.2d 1184, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 358, 658 P.2d 433 (1983), and cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1209, 103 S. Ct. 3540, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1390 (1983).\n\nEmployer's right of reimbursement following joint tort.— Where a workman (worker) has obtained a verdict against third party tortfeasors for a work-related injury and the verdict, under comparative fault principles, includes a determination that the employer is at fault and such fault is a proximate cause of the workman's (worker's) injury, such a determination does not reduce or affect the employer's right to be reimbursed for amounts paid in compensation and medical benefits.Taylor v. Delgarno Transp., Inc., 1983-NMSC-052, 100 N.M. 138, 667 P.2d 445.\n\nEmployer entitled to reimbursement where employee sues third party tort-feasors.— Once an employee has recovered a judgment against a third party tort-feasor, that employee may not thereafter claim compensation for the same injury, and the employer, or its insurer, has the right to reimbursement of any amounts paid the employee, in the event the employee successfully sues a third party, since the intent of the Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Act is to prevent double recovery. This is also true where the employee settles the claim against the third party tort-feasor.Security Ins. Co. v. Chapman, 1975-NMSC-052, 88 N.M. 292, 540 P.2d 222.\n\nThis section of the New Mexico Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Act has been consistently interpreted as a reimbursement statute involving only one cause of action, under which the workman (worker) sues the third party tort-feasor for the entire amount of damages and the employer or insurer is reimbursed out of amounts received by the workman (worker).Security Ins. Co. v. Chapman, 1975-NMSC-052, 88 N.M. 292, 540 P.2d 222.\n\nReimbursement limited to worker's duplicative recovery.— An employer is not necessarily entitled to a full reimbursement from an employee's fair, but partial, tort recovery, but is entitled to recoup the amount of a worker's duplicative recovery; moreover, those amounts that the employee reasonably receives for injuries not addressed by workers' compensation, such as pain and suffering, may not be recovered by the employer.Gutierrez v. City of Albuquerque, 1998-NMSC-027, 125 N.M. 643, 964 P.2d 807.\n\nWhere an employee received workers' compensation benefits under the employer's policy and also received benefits under the employer's uninsured motorist policy, the employer was entitled solely to reimbursement and potential future offset credit for those uninsured motorist benefits that duplicated the workers' compensation benefits paid or to be paid to the employee.Chavez v. S.E.D. Labs., 2000-NMSC-034, 129 N.M. 794, 14 P.3d 532.\n\nRight to reimbursement not waived by failure to participate in trial.— The insurer's right to reimbursement is established by this section and that right is not waived by failure to participate in the trial of the workman's (worker's) action against the third party.Herrera v. Springer Corp., 1973-NMCA-041, 85 N.M. 6, 508 P.2d 1303,rev'd on other grounds, 1973-NMSC-057, 85 N.M. 201, 510 P.2d 1072.\n\nPayments presumed for original injury wherethere was no court determination as to the compensation award or as to whether the compensation paid by the insurer was for the original injury or for an alleged aggravation caused by an alleged improper blood transfusion, and the employer's insurer paid the employee benefits which were less than a total permanent award (paying him for a period and then discontinuing payments) altogether, without a release having been obtained, the employee neither giving an election in writing as required by Section 52-1-49 NMSA 1978 nor filing suit against the employer for additional workmen's (workers') compensation benefits for the alleged malpractice, but instead electing to sue the physicians, technicians and hospital; then under the facts any payments made by the insurer to the employee must be presumed to be benefits for his original injury, and it was not entitled to reimbursement from the employee where he settled with the hospital and doctors.Security Ins. Co. v. Chapman, 1975-NMSC-052, 88 N.M. 292, 540 P.2d 222.\n\nIV. UNINSURED MOTORIST INSURANCE.\n\nRecoveries based upon an employer-provided uninsured motorist policy,as opposed to a third-party tort action, is a distinction without a difference for the purpose of calculating the amount of reimbursement due an employer.Chavez v. S.E.D. Labs., 2000-NMCA-034, 128 N.M. 768, 999 P.2d 412.\n\nNo offset for underinsured motorist insurance provider.— Subsection C of this section does not entitle the uninsured or underinsured motorist insurance provider to a credit for the amount of workers' compensation benefits that the employee was not required to reimburse to the workers' compensation carrier by reason of a settlement between the employee and the workers' compensation carrier; the settlement did not implicate or affect the UIM insurer's responsibility under the UIM policy and the UIM insurer remained liable for the full amount of UIM coverage to the extent of damages proved by the employee.Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co. v. Vigil, 1996-NMCA-062, 121 N.M. 812, 918 P.2d 728.\n\nEmployee may retain difference from coverage benefits.— Subsection C does not preclude an employee from retaining the difference between uninsured motorist benefits and workers' compensation benefits, notwithstanding the fact that the employer has paid the premiums for each coverage. The fact that the same insurer issued both policies to the employer is immaterial. If the employee is an insured occupant of the vehicle under the terms of the automobile policy, he is entitled to recover the proceeds of the uninsured motorist coverage subject only to his employer's statutory right to reimbursement for the workers' compensation benefits that it has paid.Draper v. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co., 1994-NMSC-002, 116 N.M. 775, 867 P.2d 1157.\n\nEstate of deceased worker not entitled to recover under employer's uninsured motorist insurance.— Where estate of decedent sought to recover damages under decedent's employer's uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage after decedent was killed in the course of his employment by a co-worker operating an employer-owned motor vehicle, decedent's estate was not entitled to recover damages under the employer's uninsured motorist insurance, because the uninsured motorist statute, 66-5-301(A) NMSA 1978, only benefits persons \"legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles\", and under the Workers' Compensation Act (WCA), 52-1-1 to -70 NMSA 1978, an employee who was injured in a workplace accident caused by an employer or its representative may only seek a remedy authorized under the WCA, and under the WCA such a employee is not legally entitled to recover damages under the uninsured motorist statute.Vasquez v. American Cas. Co. of Reading, 2017-NMSC-003.\n\nLaw reviews.— For survey of 1990-91 workers' compensation law, see 22 N.M.L.
