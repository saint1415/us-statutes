      "text": "Sections 41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Tort Claims Act\".\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-14-1, enacted by Laws 1976, ch. 58, § 1; 1977, ch. 386, § 1; 1981, ch. 118, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For immunity from liability for employers for statements in references of former employees,see50-12-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nConstitutionality.— The legislature acted constitutionally in enacting the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 to 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] following judicial abolition of sovereign immunity.Ferguson v. N.M. State Hwy. Comm'n, 1982-NMCA-180, 99 N.M. 194, 656 P.2d 244, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 226, 656 P.2d 889 (1983).\n\nAct does not violate Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and New Mexico constitutions.Garcia v. Albuquerque Pub. Sch. Bd. of Educ., 1980-NMCA-081, 95 N.M. 391, 622 P.2d 699, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 426, 622 P.2d 1046 (1981).\n\nPolicy of act.— The declared policy of this act indicates that the legislature authorized the filing of claims against governmental entities except in situations where the state may not have been able to act for some specific reason, so long as the act complained of falls within the list set out in this act.Methola v. County of Eddy, 1980-NMSC-145, 95 N.M. 329, 622 P.2d 234.\n\nThis act was enacted in response to the judicial abrogation of sovereign immunity inHicks v. State, 1975-NMSC-056, 88 N.M. 588, 592, 544 P.2d 1153, and the basic intent was to reestablish government immunity, while creating specific exceptions for which the government could be sued for tort liability.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Risk Mgmt. Div., 1995-NMSC-046, 120 N.M. 178, 899 P.2d 1132.\n\nImportant policies underlying enactment of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 to 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] were to protect the public treasury, to enable the government to function unhampered by the threat of legal actions that would inhibit the administration of traditional state activities, and to enable the government to effectively carry out its services.Maestas v. Zager, 2005-NMCA-013, 136 N.M. 764, 105 P.3d 317,rev'd on other grounds, 2007-NMSC-003, 141 N.M. 154, 152 P.3d 141.\n\nCommon-law sovereign immunity abolished.— Common-law sovereign immunity may no longer be interposed as a defense by the state or any of its political subdivisions in tort actions.Hicks v. State, 1975-NMSC-056, 88 N.M. 588, 544 P.2d 1153 (decided under prior law).\n\nReasons justifying legislature's determination to partially retain governmental immunity are:(1) there is a need to protect the public treasuries; (2) partial immunity enables the government and its various subdivisions to function unhampered by the threat of time and energy consuming legal actions which would inhibit the administration of traditional state activities; and (3) in order to effectively carry out its services, many of which are financially unprofitable and which would not be provided at a reasonable cost by private enterprise, the government needs the protection provided by some immunity.Garcia v. Albuquerque Pub. Schs. Bd. of Educ., 1980-NMCA-081, 95 N.M. 391, 622 P.2d 699, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 426, 622 P.2d 1046 (1981).\n\nAct is remedial act which applies only prospectively,in the absence of expressed legislative intent to make it retroactive.Methola v. County of Eddy, 1980-NMSC-145, 95 N.M. 329, 622 P.2d 234.\n\nAct is extension of previous similar statutes.— This act is an extension of previous statutes that recognized a limited waiver of sovereign immunity. Accordingly, a claimant's remedy under former 5-6-20, 1953 Comp., to redress a 1974 injury due to the alleged negligence of a state agency did not abate upon the repeal of that statute in 1975, nor upon the enactment of the Tort Claims Act in 1976. The claim was, thus, not barred under common-law sovereign immunity, but rather retained its vitality pursuant to former 5-6-20, 1953 Comp.Romero v. N.M. Health & Env't Dep't, 1988-NMSC-073, 107 N.M. 516, 760 P.2d 1282.\n\nTraditional concepts of negligence.— Liability under this act is premised on traditional concepts of negligence.Lujan v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2015-NMCA-005, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nRequirements of negligence action.— A negligence action under this act requires that there be a duty owed from the defendant to the plaintiff, that based on a standard of reasonable care under the circumstances, the defendant breached that duty, and that the breach was a cause in fact and proximate cause of the plaintiff's damages.Lujan v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2015-NMCA-005, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nDuty of ordinary care.— The state has a duty to exercise ordinary care in the maintenance of its highways, but foreseeability is not a factor to consider when determining the existence of a duty and is relevant only to determining whether there is a breach of duty.Lujan v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2015-NMCA-005, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nQuestions of fact for a jury.— Whether a defendant breached the duty of ordinary care and whether an act or omission may be deemed a proximate cause of an injury are questions of fact for a jury to decide.Lujan v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2015-NMCA-005, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nWrongful death action.— In a wrongful death action, where the state department of transportation had a duty to maintain roadways in a safe condition for the benefit of the public, including reasonable inspections of roadways in order to identify and remove dangerous debris, and where department failed to exercise ordinary care in its duty, there were questions of fact as to whether the department had constructive notice of the dangerous debris, whether the department breached a duty to decedent, and whether the department's failure to act was the proximate cause of the accident, making summary judgment improper.Lujan v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2015-NMCA-005, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nAction not barred by concurrent § 1983 action.— The New Mexico Tort Claims Act does not prohibit a plaintiff from bringing an action for damages under that act against a governmental entity or public employee if the plaintiff also pursues, by reason of the same occurrence or chain of events, an action against the same entity or employee pursuant to the Federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983.Wells v. County of Valencia, 1982-NMSC-048, 98 N.M. 3, 644 P.2d 517.\n\nStrict construction.— Since this act is in derogation of petitioner's common-law rights to sue governmental employees for negligence, the act is to be strictly construed insofar as it modifies the common law.Methola v. County of Eddy, 1980-NMCA-145, 95 N.M. 329, 622 P.2d 234.\n\nThis article is in derogation of one's common-law right to sue and is to be strictly construed.Estate of Gutierrez v. Albuquerque Police Dep't, 1986-NMCA-023, 104 N.M. 111, 717 P.2d 87, cert. deniedsub nom. Haney v. Albuquerque Police Dep't., 103 N.M. 798, 715 P.2d 71 (1986),overruled on other grounds by Bracken v. Yates Petroleum Corp., 1988-NMSC-072, 107 N.M. 463, 760 P.2d 155.\n\nThe Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 to 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] must be strictly construed.Fought v. State, 1988-NMCA-088, 107 N.M. 715, 764 P.2d 142,overruled in part on other grounds byFolz v. State, 1993-NMCA-066, 115 N.M. 639, 857 P.2d 39, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 602, 856 P.2d 250.\n\nWhere there is no liability insurance, defense of sovereign immunity is validas to a tort committed prior to July 1, 1976.New Mexico Livestock Bd. v. Dose, 1980-NMSC-022, 94 N.M. 68, 607 P.2d 606.\n\nIndemnification contract impermissible.— Provision in a contract between a city and a beverage company under which the city agreed to indemnify the company against certain liabilities is impermissible to the extent it required the city to assume liability outside the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 to 41-4-27 NMSA 1978]. 2000 Op.

      "heading": "Legislative declaration.",
      "text": "A. The legislature recognizes the inherently unfair and inequitable results which occur in the strict application of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. On the other hand, the legislature recognizes that while a private party may readily be held liable for his torts within the chosen ambit of his activity, the area within which the government has the power to act for the public good is almost without limit, and therefore government should not have the duty to do everything that might be done. Consequently, it is declared to be the public policy of New Mexico that governmental entities and public employees shall only be liable within the limitations of the Tort Claims Act and in accordance with the principles established in that act.\n\nB. The Tort Claims Act shall be read as abolishing all judicially-created categories such as \"governmental\" or \"proprietary\" functions and \"discretionary\" or \"ministerial\" acts previously used to determine immunity or liability. Liability for acts or omissions under the Tort Claims Act shall be based upon the traditional tort concepts of duty and the reasonably prudent person's standard of care in the performance of that duty. The Tort Claims Act in no way imposes a strict liability for injuries upon governmental entities or public employees. Determination of the standard of care required in any particular instance should be made with the knowledge that each governmental entity has financial limitations within which it must exercise authorized power and discretion in determining the extent and nature of its activities.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-14-2, enacted by Laws 1976, ch. 58, § 2.\n\n\"In derogation of common law.\"— Insofar as it reestablished sovereign immunity, the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] was in derogation of the common law, but in its exceptions, the act restored the common law right to sue in those specific situations; because of the complex relationship between the act and the common law, the more useful canon of construction is that requiring courts to give effect to the legislature's intent.Brenneman v. Board of Regents of UNM, 2004-NMCA-003, 135 N.M. 68, 84 P.3d 685, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-003, 135 N.M. 51, 84 P.3d 668.\n\nTraditional concepts of negligence.— Liability under this act is premised on traditional concepts of negligence.Lujan v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2015-NMCA-005, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nWrongful death action.— In a wrongful death action, where the state department of transportation had a duty to maintain roadways in a safe condition for the benefit of the public, including reasonable inspections of roadways in order to identify and remove dangerous debris, and where department failed to exercise ordinary care in its duty, there were questions of fact as to whether the department had constructive notice of the dangerous debris, whether the department breached a duty to decedent, and whether the department's failure to act was the proximate cause of the accident, making summary judgment improper.Lujan v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2015-NMCA-005, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nDifferent treatment of government and private tortfeasors.— The legislature never intended government and private tortfeasors to receive identical treatment. The liabilities of the private tortfeasor in no way compare with the potential liabilities of the state highway and transportation department [department of transportation] for the multitude of daily injuries and deaths on the state's highways.Marrujo v. N.M. State Hwy. Transp. Dep't, 1994-NMSC-116, 118 N.M. 753, 887 P.2d 747.\n\nIdentification of entity against whom liability asserted.— Plaintiffs may not, by relying on the doctrine of respondeat superior, avoid the need to identify the particular entity against whom liability is asserted.Silva v. State, 1987-NMSC-107, 106 N.M. 472, 745 P.2d 380.\n\nTo hold municipality liable for the conduct of third personswould be contrary to sound public policy and create policing requirements difficult to fulfill.Trujillo v. City of Albuquerque, 1979-NMCA-127, 93 N.M. 564, 603 P.2d 303, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 629, 614 P.2d 546.\n\nThe Tort Claims Act grants immunity for strict liabilityin tort.McCurry v. City of Farmington, 1982-NMCA-055, 97 N.M. 728, 643 P.2d 292.\n\nImmunity waiver is not for indirect or incidental victims.— The legislature did not intend by this section to waive immunity for injuries to indirect or incidental victims of tortious acts committed by government employees. The plaintiff's, as children of the deceased killed by law enforcement officers, were unforeseeable; as injured parties; therefore, the officers owed no duty to them.Lucero v. Salazar, 1994-NMCA-066, 117 N.M. 803, 877 P.2d 1106, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 802, 877 P.2d 1105.\n\nBut extends to claims for loss of consortium.Once a duty is established, loss of consortium damages flow from the principles of tort liability; as loss of consortium is a damage resulting from bodily injury and loss of consortium plaintiffs are foreseeable, loss of consortium is exactly the type of damage \"based upon the traditional tort concepts of duty\" that the legislature intended to include under the applicable waivers of sovereign immunity in the Tort Claims Act.Brenneman v. Board of Regents of UNM, 2004-NMCA-003, 135 N.M. 68, 84 P.3d 685, cert. denied, 2003-NMCERT-003, 135 N.M. 51, 84 P.3d 668.\n\nClaim for loss of consortium is permissible under the Tort Claims Act.— Where plaintiffs' father was shot and killed by law enforcement officers during a stolen vehicle investigation, the district court erred in dismissing plaintiffs' complaint on the ground that their loss of consortium claims did not fall within the Tort Claims Act (TCA), because the TCA waives a law enforcement officer's sovereign immunity from liability for personal injury and for bodily injury damages resulting from battery, and loss of consortium damages may be characterized as either personal or bodily injury damages, and therefore both the injury and the tort from which the plaintiff's claim for loss of consortium damages derive are specifically enumerated under 41-4-12 NMSA 1978.Thompson v. City of Albuquerque, 2017-NMSC-021,aff'g2017-NMCA-002, 386 P.3d 1015.\n\nDamages for loss of consortium may be recovered.— Where plaintiffs' father was shot and killed by law enforcement officers during a stolen vehicle investigation, the district court erred in dismissing plaintiffs' complaint on the ground that their loss of consortium claims did not fall within the Tort Claims Act (TCA), because generally, plaintiffs should be allowed to recover for loss of consortium if the evidence shows that their relationships with the decedent were sufficiently close financially, socially, or both, and if it was foreseeable that the injury to the decedent would harm the relationships, and loss of consortium can be asserted against New Mexico government actors, despite that it is not specifically mentioned in the TCA, provided that the underlying tort, the one that caused direct physical injury, itself triggers an immunity waiver under the TCA.Thompson v. City of Albuquerque, 2017-NMCA-002, cert. granted.\n\nNo distinction shall be drawn with regard to \"public\" or \"special\" dutyof governmental employees whose immunity to suit for acts of negligence has been excepted under this article.Schear v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1984-NMSC-079, 101 N.M. 671, 687 P.2d 728.\n\nThe distinction between public and private duty is invalid, and applied retrospectively.Schear v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1984-NMSC-079, 101 N.M. 671, 687 P.2d 728;Wittkowski v. State, 1985-NMCA-066, Corr. Dep't, 103 N.M. 526, 710 P.2d 93, cert. quashed, 103 N.M. 446, 708 P.2d 1047,overruled on other grounds bySilva v. State, 1987-NMSC-107, 106 N.M. 472, 745 P.2d 380.\n\nPersonal actions against public employees barred.— The language of Subsection F of 5-1-1 NMSA 1978 constitutes a bar to personal actions against public employees; it does not provide an independent statutory waiver of governmental immunity.Gallegos v. Trujillo, 1992-NMCA-090, 114 N.M. 435, 839 P.2d 645, cert. denied, 114 N.M. 314, 838 P.2d 468.\n\nGovernmental entities can share maintenance responsibilities for roadby agreement.Bierner v. City of Truth or Consequences, 2004-NMCA-093, 136 N.M. 197, 96 P.3d 322.\n\nCity duty to maintain road.— Whether a city had either a statutory or a common law duty to maintain a road is dispositive on the issue of immunity.Bierner v. City of Truth or Consequences, 2004-NMCA-093, 136 N.M. 197, 96 P.3d 322.\n\nWaiver of immunity inapplicable.— Where there is no question that the highway department had the sole responsibility to maintain the street in the vicinity where the accident occurred, the waiver of immunity in Subsection A of this section does not apply to the city because it had no duty upon which negligence could be premised.Bierner v. City of Truth or Consequences, 2004-NMCA-093, 136 N.M. 197, 96 P.3d 322.\n\nNavajo police officer not New Mexico \"public employee\".— Fact that Navajo Nation police officer was cross-deputized as a county sheriff did not make the officer a \"public employee\" of a New Mexico governmental body.Williams v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1998-NMCA-090, 125 N.M. 445, 963 P.2d 522, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 654, 964 P.2d 818.\n\nImmunity for wrongful decision to perform autopsy.— In an action for damages on the basis of an alleged wrongful decision to perform an autopsy, even if 24-12-4 NMSA 1978, which provides for consent for post-mortem examinations, created a private cause of action, it did not override the state medical investigator's grant of immunity under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Begay v. State, 1985-NMCA-117, 104 N.M. 483, 723 P.2d 252,rev'd on other groundssub nom., Smialek v. Begay, 1986-NMSC-049, 104 N.M. 375, 721 P.2d 1306, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1020, 93 L. Ed. 2d 727, 107 S. Ct. 677.\n\nSchool district immune from liability for breach of nondelegable duty.— Direct liability of the possessor of land under a nondelegable duty to ensure against an unreasonable risk of injury for a special danger is based not on what the possessor knew or should have known, but upon breach of duty imputed as a matter of law. This is strict liability for which the legislature granted immunity under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978]. Consequently, a school district was immune from its joint and several liability for the acts of independent contractors in constructing a high voltage lighting system that caused the death of a student attending a school football game.Saiz v. Belen Sch. Dist., 1992-NMSC-018, 113 N.M. 387, 827 P.2d 102.\n\nSuit against state hospital in federal court not permitted.— Congress does not have the power to make statutes such as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) applicable to state-run hospitals without the state's express consent. As indicated by this section, 41-4-4 NMSA 1978 and 41-4-18 NMSA 1978, New Mexico has not consented to be sued in federal court for violations of EMTALA, nor for any other tort.Ward v. Presbyterian Healthcare Servs., 72 F. Supp. 2d 1285 (D.N.M. 1999).\n\nOrdinary care for preservation of life and health of arrestee.— When a governmental entity through its agents, by virtue of its law enforcement powers, has arrested and imprisoned a human being, it is bound to exercise ordinary and reasonable care, under the circumstances, for the preservation of the arrestee's life and health.Doe v. City of Albuquerque, 1981-NMCA-049, 96 N.M. 433, 631 P.2d 728.\n\nJury instruction on \"financial limitations\".— Without evidence on the issue of \"financial limitations,\" a party is not entitled to a jury instruction as to a governmental entity's standard of care as circumscribed by the \"financial limitations\" within which it must exercise authorized power.Doe v. City of Albuquerque, 1981-NMCA-049, 96 N.M. 433, 631 P.2d 728.\n\nTexas' sovereign immunity recognized as a matter of comity in tort claim lawsuit.— In a medical negligence case filed agains t a Texas-based physician who was acting within the scope of his employment at Texas tech hospital, a governmental unit of the state of Texas, the district court erred in failing to extend comity to Texas and apply provisions of the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA), because it is not a violation of New Mexico public policy when a similar action would not be barred under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, when Texas appellate courts have previously extended comity and applied tort claims provisions from other jurisdictions that differed from the TTCA's provisions, when Texas' strong public policy interest in applying uniform standards of liability and immunity to the conduct of state-employed physicians who provide medical care at state-run facilities is not outweighed by New Mexico's interest in providing a forum for New Mexicans who seek redress for medical negligence, and when failing to extend immunity to Texas in this case would encourage forum shopping by allowing plaintiffs to name Texas state employees in lawsuits in New Mexico when those plaintiffs could not do so in Texas.Monta o v. Frezza, 2017-NMSC-015,rev'g, 2015-NMCA-069.\n\nPrinciples of comity applied to determine choice of law when tort is committed by non-resident.— Comity, the principle that the courts of one state give effect to the laws of another state or extend immunity to a sister sovereign, not as a rule of law, but rather out of deference or respect, should be extended to other states but only if doing so will not violate or undermine New Mexico's public policies. In determining whether to extend immunity, courts should consider whether the forum state would enjoy similar immunity under similar circumstances, whether the state sued has or is likely to extend immunity to other states, whether the forum state has a strong interest in litigating the case, and whether extending immunity would prevent forum shopping.Monta o v. Frezza, 2015-NMCA-069, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-006, and cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-006.\n\nIn a medical negligence case filed against a Texas-based physician, where the district court was required to determine whether the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (NMTCA) [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] or Texas law should apply, the district court did not err in determining that New Mexico law should apply because applying Texas law would be contrary to New Mexico's public policies in that applying Texas law would contravene New Mexico's broader waiver of immunity, would limit suits to governmental entities and prohibit suits against individuals, and would impose a notice requirement substantially more restrictive than that in the NMTCA.Monta o v. Frezza, 2015-NMCA-069, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-006, and cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-006.\n\nLaw reviews.— For survey, \"Torts: Sovereign and Governmental Immunity in New Mexico,\" see 6 N.M. L.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nScope of duties.— Where school administrators allegedly used procedures ostensibly based upon statute and regulations and used the mechanism of their employment to harass and attempt to force plaintiff out of her job, the school administrators were acting within the scope of their duties as school administrators and were immune from liability under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Henning v. Rounds, 2007-NMCA-139, 142 N.M. 803, 171 P.3d 317.\n\nUnder the definition of \"scope of duties\" in Subsection G of this section, when reconciled with the indemnification provisions in Subsection E of 41-4-4 NMSA 1978 and Subsection A of 41-4-17 NMSA, an employee's acts are not excluded simply because they are criminal.Risk Mgmt. Div. v. McBrayer, 2000-NMCA-104, 129 N.M. 778, 14 P.3d 43, cert. denied, 130 N.M. 17, 16 P.3d 442.\n\nFailing to perform a regular duty, such as timely responding to requests for records, still falls with the scope of duties for purposes of the Tort Claims Act.Derringer v. State, 2003-NMCA-073, 133 N.M. 721, 68 P.3d 961, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 727, 69 P.3d 237.\n\nPublic employee may be within scope of authorized duty even if the employee's acts are fraudulent, intentionally malicious, or even criminal.Seeds v. Lucero, 2005-NMCA-067, 137 N.M. 589, 113 P.3d 859, cert. denied, sub nom.Seeds v. Vandervossen, 2005-NMCERT-005, 137 N.M. 522, 113 P.3d 345.\n\nDriving to and from a work-related activity is within the scope of a public employee's duties.— When a public employee is driving to and from a work-related function, such travel benefits the employer and is necessarily \"required, requested or authorized\" within the definition of \"scope of duty\" set forth in the Tort Claims Act.Wright v. Seventh Judicial District Ct., 2024-NMCA-059, cert. denied.\n\nThe district court was vicariously liable for judge's negligence where judge was acting within the scope of her official duties while driving home from a work-related event.— Where plaintiffs filed suit under the Tort Claims Act (TCA), 41-4-1 to 41-4-27 NMSA 1978, against a seventh judicial district court judge and her employer, the seventh judicial district court (SJDC), seeking damages for personal injury and wrongful death after the judge, while driving home from a speaking event for a private contractor who worked with the SJDC by providing a variety of pretrial services for the court including treatments related to the SJDC's adult drug court treatment program, collided with plaintiffs who were cycling along the edge of U.S. Highway 60, and where plaintiffs sought to establish that the judge was acting within the scope of her official duties under the TCA such that the SJDC was vicariously liable for the harms caused in the accident, the district court did not err in granting plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment, finding that, as a matter of law, the judge was acting within the scope of her official duties as a judge in the SJDC at the time her vehicle struck the cyclists, and therefore the SJDC was vicariously liable under the TCA for the injuries the judge caused during the accident, because the judge's attendance at the event, and her associated travel, provided meaningful benefit to the SJDC's mission regarding its drug courts, and therefore the judge's conduct had a sufficient nexus to the duties requested, required, or authorized by the SJDC.Wright v. Seventh Judicial District Ct., 2024-NMCA-059, cert. denied.\n\nCo-conspirator's acts are imputed to employee.— As long as the act of conspiring is within the scope of a public employee's duties, any co-conspirator's acts that are imputed to the public employee will be, by definition, within the scope of the employee's duties.Seeds v. Lucero, 2005-NMCA-067, 137 N.M. 589, 113 P.3d 859, cert. deniedsub nom. Seeds v.

Town of Bernalillo, 1983-NMCA-053, 99 N.M. 737, 663 P.2d 713.\n\nII. GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES.\n\nCorrections department is a \"governmental\" entityunder the Tort Claims Act, not an \"employee\" of a governmental entity. Therefore, it does not fall within 41-4-6 and 41-4-10 NMSA 1978 (negligence of \"public employees\").Silva v. State, 1987-NMSC-107, 106 N.M. 472, 745 P.2d 380.\n\nCity is \"governmental entity\".— Under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978], a city is a \"governmental entity\" because of its legal status as a \"local public body\" and as a \"political subdivision of the state.\"Cole v. City of Las Cruces, 1983-NMSC-007, 99 N.M. 302, 657 P.2d 629.\n\nCharter schools are public schools subject to the Tort Claims Act.— A charter school is a public school that operates as part of a political subdivision of the state and, as such, is a governmental entity within the meaning of Subsection B of this section.Kreutzer v. Aldo Leopold High School, 2018-NMCA-005.\n\nIssue of whether town or municipality is \"local public body\" is not open to question.Cozart v. Town of Bernalillo, 1983-NMCA-053, 99 N.M. 737, 663 P.2d 713.\n\nState police and highway departments are \"state agencies\".— The state police department and the state highway department fit the statutory description of \"state\" or \"state agency.\"Ferguson v. N.M. State Hwy. Comm'n, 1981-NMCA-071, 98 N.M. 718, 652 P.2d 740,rev'd on other grounds, 1982-NMSC-107, 98 N.M. 680, 652 P.2d 230.\n\nEmergency communications center is a \"governmental entity\" for purposes of the Tort Claims Act.— Where plaintiff, a police officer who was injured during a call for service, filed suit for personal injuries against the Valencia regional emergency communications center (VRECC), an entity created pursuant to the New Mexico Enhanced 911 Act, NMSA 1978, §§ 63-9D-1 to 63-9D-11.1, to provide enhanced 911 emergency communications functions for an area that includes the incorporated boundaries of the villages of Los Lunas and Bosque Farms and Valencia county, and where the district court dismissed claims against the VRECC, finding that the VRECC was a governmental entity for purposes of the Tort Claims Act and that immunity had not been waived, the district court did not err in dismissing claims against the VRECC, because the VRECC is an entity created pursuant to statute to provide basic safety and health services on behalf of the villages and Valencia county, is controlled by the villages and Valencia county, and possesses their same powers and duty with regard to the health and welfare of their citizens, and is thus a \"governmental entity\" under the Tort Claims Act.Gebler v. Valencia Reg'l Emergency Commc'n Ctr., 2023-NMCA-070.\n\nFoster parents are state actors.— Where personal representative of wrongful death estate of son and guardian ad litem for minor daughter, who were removed from, and then returned to their biological mother, brought a tort claim action against the Children, Youth and Families Department (CYFD), alleging that CYFD placed the children in or subjected them to an injurious and unsafe environment, court held that foster parents are state actors because in the foster care context, a custodial relationship sufficient to establish a special relationship arises when the state assumes control of a child's environment and replaces whatever private source of protection the child had in the free world with a new source of protection.Valdez v. Roybal, 186 F.Supp.3d 1197 (D. N.M. 2016).\n\nIrrigation district is \"local public body\"for purposes of this section.Tompkins v. Carlsbad Irrigation Dist., 1981-NMCA-072, 96 N.M. 368, 630 P.2d 767.\n\nPrivately owned irrigation company is not \"local public body\"under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978], even though it performs the same function as a public irrigation district, where the company has had the option of reorganizing as a body politic and gaining the benefits and obligations of such status but has chosen not to do so.Carmona v. Hagerman Irrigation Co., 1998-NMSC-007, 125 N.M. 59, 957 P.2d 44.\n\nWater and Sanitation District Act districts are a quasi-municipal governmental entity and fall within the definition of \"governmental entity\" under the Tort Claims Act.El Dorado Utils., Inc. v. Eldorado Area Water and Sanitation Dist., 2005-NMCA-036, 137 N.M. 217, 109 P.3d 305.\n\nSummary judgment for defendant was improper where defendant failed to show that nonprofit corporation was so intertwined with a governmental entity for the Tort Claims Act to apply.— Where plaintiff, the personal representative of decedent, filed a complaint alleging medical malpractice and other claims arising from medical treatment received by decedent, and where defendant, the surgeon that performed the surgery on decedent, filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that he was a public employee and therefore the two-year statute of limitations barred claims that were filed more than two years after decedent's last visit with defendant, the district court erred in finding that defendant's employer, a nonprofit corporation, fell under the ambit of the Tort Claims Act and that the complaint was untimely, because in his motion, defendant did not make any showing that his employer, a nonprofit corporation, was so intertwined with a governmental entity for the Tort Claims Act to apply. The district court therefore erred by holding plaintiff's claims were time barred by the Tort Claims Act's two-year statute of limitations.Murphy v. Lash, 2024-NMCA-031, cert. granted.\n\nPublic defenders' immunity not violation of equal protection.— Public defenders, whether regular employees of the public defender's office or performing as contractors, are immune from malpractice claims, and statutes providing such immunity did not violate the equal protection rights of a former prisoner.Coyazo v. State, 1995-NMCA-056, 120 N.M. 47, 897 P.2d 234.\n\nIII. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.\n\nOffice of state engineer employee.— Where the defendant, who was employed as a water resource specialist and supervisor of the Hondo Basin by the office of the state engineer, who had never actually arrested anyone, who had no law enforcement certification, who did not carry a gun, whose duties were mainly administrative, but included enforcement regarding water rights, and whose vehicle did not have police emergency light, caused the destruction of the plaintiff's dam that diverted water to which the plaintiff had some right pursuant to a compliance order that was based solely on the defendant's field investigation, the defendant did not engage in conduct sufficient to trigger the law enforcement officer waiver of immunity.Limacher v. Spivey, 2008-NMCA-163, 145 N.M. 344, 198 P.3d 370, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-011, 145 N.M. 531, 202 P.3d 124.\n\nAnimal control officer.— For an animal control officer to come within the definition of \"law enforcement officer\" under this section, the officer's principal duties under law must be: (a) to hold in custody any person accused of a criminal offense, (b) to maintain public order or (c) to make arrests for crimes. It suffices if an animal control officer's principal duties are either (a), (b) or (c).Baptiste v. City of Las Cruces, 1993-NMCA-017, 115 N.M. 178, 848 P.2d 1105.\n\nSheriffs and deputies.— The Eddy county sheriff, deputies and the jailers at the Bernalillo county jail are \"law enforcement officers\" within the meaning of Subsection D.Methola v. County of Eddy, 1980-NMSC-145, 95 N.M. 329, 622 P.2d 234.\n\nDistrict attorneys are not law enforcement officers.— Neither district attorney nor assistant district attorney is a \"law enforcement officer,\" as defined in Subsection D; rather, both are \"public employees\" under Subsection E.Candelaria v. Robinson, 1980-NMCA-003, 93 N.M. 786, 606 P.2d 196.\n\nDistrict attorneys and their staffs do not fall within the \"law enforcement officer\" exception from immunity under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Coyazo v. State, 1995-NMCA-056, 120 N.M. 47, 897 P.2d 234.\n\nWarden and head of department not law enforcement officers.— The secretary of corrections and the penitentiary warden were not proper defendants in a wrongful death suit arising out of the escape of state prisoners, who killed a store owner during a robbery, since they are not \"law enforcement officers\".Wittkowski v. State, Corr. Dep't, 1985-NMCA-066, 103 N.M. 526, 710 P.2d 93, cert. quashed, 103 N.M. 446, 708 P.2d 1047 (1985),overruled on other grounds bySilva v. State, 1987-NMSC-107, 106 N.M. 472, 745 P.2d 380.\n\nSecretary of corrections.— The secretary of corrections is not a law enforcement officer within the meaning of 41-4-12 NMSA 1978 as defined in Subsection D of this section.Silva v. State, 1987-NMSC-107, 106 N.M. 472, 745 P.2d 380.\n\nTo determine whether positions are of a law enforcementnature, the court will look at the character of the principal duties involved, those duties to which employees devote the majority of their time.Anchondo v. Corrections Dep't, 1983-NMSC-051, 100 N.M. 108, 666 P.2d 1255.\n\nThe statutory requirement that the defendants be law enforcement officers does not focus on the defendants' specific acts at the time of their alleged negligence; instead, it simply requires that the defendants' principal duties, those duties to which they devote a majority of their time, be of a law enforcement nature. The requirement in 41-4-12 NMSA 1978 that the officer must be acting within the scope of his duties simply means that the officer must be acting within the scope of employment in order to be sued in his or her capacity as a law enforcement officer.Weinstein v. City of Santa Fe ex rel. Santa Fe Police Dep't, 1996-NMSC-021, 121 N.M. 646, 916 P.2d 1313.\n\nCounty detention center officers.— The director and the captain and assistant director of a county detention center are subject to suit as law enforcement officers under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Davis v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1999-NMCA-110, 127 N.M. 785, 987 P.2d 1172.\n\nDirector of DMV is not law enforcement officer.— The director of the motor vehicle division, whose duties involved principally administrative matters, and who did not serve as a full-time law enforcement officer whose principal duties involved holding in custody persons accused of criminal offenses, maintaining public order or making arrests for crimes, was not a \"law enforcement officer\" within the contemplation of 41-4-12 NMSA 1978.Dunn v. State ex rel. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-059, 116 N.M. 1, 859 P.2d 469.\n\nMotor vehicle division official who investigated plaintiff's participation in forging automobile title was not acting as a full-time law enforcement officer, as contemplated by Subsection D of this section, and his immunity from suit was not waived.Boydston v. New Mexico Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 125 F.3d 861 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\nParole officers not law enforcement officers.— Parole officers and their supervisors are not law enforcement officers under Subsection D of this section, and therefore the waiver of immunity in 41-4-12 NMSA 1978 does not apply to them.Vigil v. Martinez, 1992-NMCA-033, 113 N.M. 714, 832 P.2d 405.\n\nA tribal police officer, also commissioned as a county deputy sheriff and acting under his state authority as a deputy sheriff, is a \"public employee\" under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act.— A tribal officer, who is also commissioned as a county deputy sheriff, is a \"public employee\" under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] when the tribal officer is enforcing state law, not tribal law.Loya v. Gutierrez, 2015-NMSC-017,rev'g2014-NMCA-028, 319 P.3d 656.\n\nWhere an on-duty, full time pueblo tribal law enforcement officer, who was also commissioned as a Santa Fe county deputy sheriff, stopped plaintiff's vehicle on a state-maintained highway within the exterior boundaries of the pueblo and arrested plaintiff for reckless driving, the tribal officer was acting under his state authority as a deputy sheriff, not under tribal authority, when he charged, detained, and prosecuted plaintiff under state law; the tribal officer was therefore a public employee under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act because he was a person acting on behalf or in service of a governmental entity, in an official capacity, whether with or without compensation.Loya v. Gutierrez, 2015-NMSC-017,rev'g2014-NMCA-028, 319 P.3d 656.\n\nTribal police officer was not a \"public employee\".— Where an on-duty, full-time pueblo tribal law enforcement officer, acting in the officer's capacity as a commissioned deputy sheriff for the county stopped plaintiff's vehicle on a state-maintained road within the exterior boundaries of the pueblo and arrested plaintiff for reckless driving; the officer was dressed in a full tribal police uniform, displaying a tribal badge of office, and driving a tribal police vehicle; in addition to acting under tribal law, the officer was on duty as a duly commissioned deputy sheriff, which gave the officer authority to arrest, charge, and jail non-Indians for violations of New Mexico state laws; the officer took plaintiff to the tribal police department for processing and later transported plaintiff to the county jail; the officer was not a salaried officer employed by the county; the pueblo was a sovereign Indian tribe; plaintiff sued the officer for violation of plaintiff's constitutional rights, the officer was not a \"law enforcement officer\" or a \"public employee\" of a \"governmental entity\" as defined in 40-4-3 NMSA 1978 and the county did not have a duty under 40-4-4 NMSA 1978 to defend or indemnify the officer for tortious acts committed while exercising the officer's authority as a commissioned deputy sheriff.Loya v. Gutierrez, 2014-NMCA-028, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-002.\n\nNavajo police officer not \"public employee\".— Fact that Navajo Nation police officer was cross-deputized as a county sheriff did not make the officer a \"public employee\" of a New Mexico governmental body.Williams v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1998-NMCA-090, 125 N.M. 445, 963 P.2d 522, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 654, 964 P.2d 818.\n\nPrison guards are not law enforcement officersfor purposes of Subsection D, because: (1) the principal duties of prison guards are to hold in custody persons who have already been convicted rather than merely accused of a criminal offense; (2) maintenance of public order relates to a public not a penitentiary setting; and (3) although prison guards may have the supplemental power to arrest pursuant to the guidelines of 33-1-10 NMSA 1978, their principal statutory duties are those set forth in 33-2-15 NMSA 1978.Callaway v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 1994-NMCA-049, 117 N.M. 637, 875 P.2d 393, cert. denied, 118 N.M. 90, 879 P.2d 91.\n\nA mayor is not a law enforcement officerfor purposes of this act.Montes v. Gallegos, 812 F. Supp. 1165 (D.N.M. 1992).\n\nMedical investigator.— The office of the medical investigator and a physician employed as a medical investigator by that office are not law enforcement officers.Dunn v. McFeeley, 1999-NMCA-084, 127 N.M. 513, 984 P.2d 760, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 389, 981 P.2d 1207.\n\nCrime laboratory.— A crime laboratory technician and his employer, the state police crime laboratory, whose duties are to examine and evaluate physical evidence that may relate to a possible offense, are not law enforcement officers.Dunn v. McFeeley, 1999-NMCA-084, 127 N.M. 513, 984 P.2d 760, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 389, 981 P.2d 1207.\n\nPrivate citizen volunteers of animal cruelty task force were not law enforcement officers.— Where ranch owners brought a federal civil rights action against the county, the state attorney general, certain police officers, and two private citizen volunteers of the state attorney general's animal cruelty task force, after plaintiffs' ranch property was searched on suspicion of illegal cockfighting, and hundreds of hens, roosters, baby chickens, and eggs were seized and destroyed, and where the private citizen volunteers moved for summary judgment, advancing a qualified immunity defense, the district court did not err in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment, because the private citizen volunteers could not be considered law enforcement officers because they were not employed or compensated by the state and had not received any law enforcement training or training on constitutional rights.Marin v. King, 720 Fed. Appx. 923 (10th Cir. 2018).\n\nGrant of summary judgment improper where defendant failed to meet his burden of showing that transit security officers were not law enforcement officers for purposes of the Tort Claims Act.— Where plaintiff brought a tort claim against the city of Albuquerque and two transit security officers (TSO), alleging excessive force, unlawful seizure, assault, battery, and false arrest/false imprisonment, and where the district court dismissed plaintiff's tort claims after concluding that the TSOs were not law enforcement officers under the provisions of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act and were therefore immune from plaintiff's tort claims, the district court erred in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment, because the description of a TSO's essential functions included providing security services, conducting periodic patrols, regulating the flow of city employees and the public to ensure safety, providing crowd and traffic control as needed, responding to calls for service and reports of crimes in progress, calling for emergency medical or police services as needed, assisting law enforcement agencies as needed, conducting preliminary investigations to determine if a crime had been committed, documenting incidents and preparing reports, providing general assistance to the public, and preparing a variety of reports regarding security enforcement activities, and therefore, aside from the absence of a gun and the authority to arrest, a TSO's job was nearly identical to the normal commonplace activities of a police officer on patrol. Defendants failed to carry their burden of showing the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact, and therefore summary judgment was improper.Hernandez v. Fitzgerald, 840 F. App'x 333 (10th Cir. 2020).\n\nMunicipal police officers are law enforcement officers.— The officers in this case are municipal police officers subject to 3-13-2 NMSA 1978, and their principal duties entail making arrests for crimes and maintaining public order; accordingly, they are law enforcement officers for purposes of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Weinstein v. City of Santa Fe ex rel. Santa Fe Police Dep't, 1996-NMSC-021, 121 N.M. 646, 916 P.2d 1313.\n\n\"Any person accused\".— A person who has been convicted is no longer an \"accused\" for the purposes of Subsection D of this section.Vigil v. Martinez, 1992-NMCA-033, 113 N.M. 714, 832 P.2d 405.\n\n\"Maintenance of public order\".— Maintenance of public order, within the meaning of Subsection D of this section, is not a principal duty of probation and parole officers or their supervisors.Vigil v. Martinez, 1992-NMCA-033, 113 N.M. 714, 832 P.2d 405.\n\nOfficers of county detention home.— Whether officers of a county detention home were acting within the scope of their duties in making an employment recommendation about a former employee was a question of fact.Davis v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1999-NMCA-110, 127 N.M. 785, 987 P.2d 1172.\n\nScope of duties.— An assistant district attorney's letter to the sheriff, containing quotation from an allegedly defamatory investigation report by the assistant district attorney, was authorized and within the scope of assistant district attorney's duty, and he was immune from liability for the alleged defamation in the letter.Candelaria v. Robinson, 1980-NMCA-003, 93 N.M. 786, 606 P.2d 196.\n\nDeputy sheriff who was involved in accident while driving her assigned department vehicle home was acting within the scope of her duties, because she was required to be available for calls at all times.Medina v. Fuller, 1999-NMCA-011, 126 N.M. 460, 971 P.2d 851.\n\nLiability for failure to detain intoxicated driver.— Law enforcement officers may be liable if they fail to detain an intoxicated driver who then acts with the requisite level of intent to commit a battery while driving intoxicated.Blea v. City of Espanola, 1994-NMCA-008, 117 N.M. 217, 870 P.2d 755, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 328, 871 P.2d 984.\n\nIV. PRIVATE PERSONS, CORPORATIONS AND ENTITIES.\n\nDevelopmental disabilities center subject to Act for discharge error.— If the state provides developmental disability services by delegating those responsibilities to a private entity under former 28-16-1 to 28-16-18 NMSA 1978, while retaining the right to determine discharge terms and the responsibility to protect patients' constitutional and statutory rights, a sufficient nexus between the private entity's decision and the state has been demonstrated so that the private entity's discharge decision will be considered state action, and the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] is applicable.LaBalbo v. Hymes, 1993-NMCA-010, 115 N.M. 314, 850 P.2d 1017, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 359, 851 P.2d 481 (decided prior to 1995 amendment).\n\nAct not applicable to foster homes.— The department of human services was not liable under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] for negligently placing a child in a foster home, since those duties fall outside of the Act.M.D.R. v. State ex rel. Human Servs. Dep't, 1992-NMCA-082, 114 N.M. 187, 836 P.2d 106.\n\nGuardian ad litem was not a \"public employee\"within the meaning of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Collins ex rel. Collins v. Tabet, 1991-NMSC-013, 111 N.M. 391, 806 P.2d 40,abrogated by State v Mares, 2024-NMSC-002.\n\nA private corporation is generally not the type of \"instrumentality\" contemplatedwithin the context of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978], although there may be situations where a private corporation may be so organized and controlled, and its affairs so conducted, as to make it merely an instrumentality or adjunct of a municipality under the terms of the act.Cole v. City of Las Cruces, 1983-NMSC-007, 99 N.M. 302, 657 P.2d 629.\n\nCommunity mental health facility employees.— Employees at a community mental health facility regulated by the health and environment department (now the department of health) were not \"public employees\" within the meaning of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978], where the regulatory scheme did not give the department the right to control the details of the work of the facility.Armijo v. Department of Health & Env't, 1989-NMCA-043, 108 N.M. 616, 775 P.2d 1333.\n\nPhysician.— Where the contract between a physician and a public hospital precluded the physician from practicing medicine except as an employee of the hospital, the hospital could fire the physician with or without cause, and dictated the terms of the physician's service; the hospital required the physician to maintain certain office hours and ask permission to change the office hours, to be an active member of the hospital staff, and to perform other duties and services requested from time to time by the hospital. The hospital compensated the physician with a salary, benefits, and insurance, paid taxes and professional dues, and provided leave time. The hospital billed patients directly for the physician's services; and the hospital provided all of the physician's supplies, equipment, and staff; the physician was a public employee.Blea v. Fields, 2005-NMSC-029, 138 N.M. 348, 120 P.3d 430.\n\nIndependent corrections contractor employees.— An employee of an independent corrections contractor is not a \"public employee\" immune from tort liability under this article.Giron v. Corrs. Corp. of Am., 14 F. Supp. 2d 1245 (D.N.M. 1998).\n\nVolunteers.— It is an express declaration of legislative intent in including volunteers acting on behalf of a governmental entity within the purview of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Celaya v. Hall, 2004-NMSC-005, 135 N.M. 115, 85 P.3d 239.\n\nTort Claims Act explicitly contemplates that volunteers acting on behalf of the government may become public employees, thereby entitled to the protections of the Tort Claims Act and subject to the reliability of the same.Celaya v. Hall, 2004-NMSC-005, 135 N.M. 115, 85 P.3d 239.\n\nSheriff's department chaplain.— Whether a defendant who volunteered as a chaplain for a county sheriff's department was a public employee or an independent contractor was a question of fact, upon which the \"right to control\" test would bear.Celaya v. Hall, 2003-NMCA-086, 134 N.M. 19, 71 P.3d 1281,aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 2004-NMSC-005, 135 N.M. 115, 85 P.3d 239.\n\nWhere, at the time of the incident, defendant had been an official sheriff's department volunteer chaplain for eight years, and as part of his official duties, defendant was summoned to crime and accident scenes by the department on an as-needed basis where he provided counseling and support services to civilians, acting primarily at the department's request, therefore, defendant was an employee of the department because, considered in context, the department exercised sufficient control over defendant's activities in a manner consistent with the status of employee.Celaya v. Hall, 2004-NMSC-005, 135 N.M. 115, 85 P.3d 239.\n\nVolunteers for the board of nursing would likely be covered under the liability policies for the state of New Mexico.— The New Mexico Tort Claims Act explicitly contemplates that volunteers acting on behalf of the government may be considered public employees subject to its protections and to its waivers of those protections, 41-4-3(F)(3) NMSA 1978, and therefore, volunteers charged with reviewing complaints and making recommendations to the nursing board regarding potential disciplinary action against licensees would likely be deemed public employees acting on behalf or in service of a governmental entity, and liability policies of the state of New Mexico likely would cover negligent acts by these volunteers.Use of Volunteers at the New Mexico State Board of Nursing(11/26/18), Att'y Gen.

      "text": "A. A governmental entity and any public employee while acting within the scope of duty are granted immunity from liability for any tort except as waived by the New Mexico Religious Freedom Restoration Act [28-22-1 to 28-22-5 NMSA 1978] and by Sections 41-4-5 through 41-4-12 NMSA 1978. Waiver of this immunity shall be limited to and governed by the provisions of Sections 41-4-13 through 41-4-25 NMSA 1978, but the waiver of immunity provided in those sections does not waive immunity granted pursuant to the Governmental Immunity Act [41-13-1 to 41-13-3 NMSA 1978].\n\nB. Unless an insurance carrier provides a defense, a governmental entity shall provide a defense, including costs and attorney fees, for any public employee when liability is sought for:\n\n(1) any tort alleged to have been committed by the public employee while acting within the scope of his duty; or\n\n(2) any violation of property rights or any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the United States or the constitution and laws of New Mexico when alleged to have been committed by the public employee while acting within the scope of his duty.\n\nC. A governmental entity shall pay any award for punitive or exemplary damages awarded against a public employee under the substantive law of a jurisdiction other than New Mexico, including other states, territories and possessions and the United States of America, if the public employee was acting within the scope of his duty.\n\nD. A governmental entity shall pay any settlement or any final judgment entered against a public employee for:\n\n(1) any tort that was committed by the public employee while acting within the scope of his duty; or\n\n(2) a violation of property rights or any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the United States or the constitution and laws of New Mexico that occurred while the public employee was acting within the scope of his duty.\n\nE. A governmental entity shall have the right to recover from a public employee the amount expended by the public entity to provide a defense and pay a settlement agreed to by the public employee or to pay a final judgment if it is shown that, while acting within the scope of his duty, the public employee acted fraudulently or with actual intentional malice causing the bodily injury, wrongful death or property damage resulting in the settlement or final judgment.\n\nF. Nothing in Subsections B, C and D of this section shall be construed as a waiver of the immunity from liability granted by Subsection A of this section or as a waiver of the state's immunity from suit in federal court under the eleventh amendment to the United States constitution.\n\nG. The duty to defend as provided in Subsection B of this section shall continue after employment with the governmental entity has been terminated if the occurrence for which damages are sought happened while the public employee was acting within the scope of duty while the public employee was in the employ of the governmental entity.\n\nH. The duty to pay any settlement or any final judgment entered against a public employee as provided in this section shall continue after employment with the governmental entity has terminated if the occurrence for which liability has been imposed happened while the public employee was acting within the scope of his duty while in the employ of the governmental entity.\n\nI. A jointly operated public school, community center or athletic facility that is used or maintained pursuant to a joint powers agreement shall be deemed to be used or maintained by a single governmental entity for the purposes of and subject to the maximum liability provisions of Section 41-4-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nJ. For purposes of this section, a \"jointly operated public school, community center or athletic facility\" includes a school, school yard, school ground, school building, gymnasium, athletic field, building, community center or sports complex that is owned or leased by a governmental entity and operated or used jointly or in conjunction with another governmental entity for operations, events or programs that include sports or athletic events or activities, child-care or youth programs, after-school or before-school activities or summer or vacation programs at the facility.\n\nK. A fire station that is used for community activities pursuant to a joint powers agreement between the fire department or volunteer fire department and another governmental entity shall be deemed to be operated or maintained by a single governmental entity for the purposes of and subject to the maximum liability provisions of Section 41-4-19 NMSA 1978.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nJoint operation of a facility.— Without proof of a joint powers agreement plaintiff cannot apply 41-4-4 I and J NMSA 1978.Gutierrez v. W. Las Vegas Sch. Dist., 2002-NMCA-068, 132 N.M. 372, 48 P.3d 761\n\nModification of common law requires strict construction.— Since the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] is in derogation of petitioner's common-law rights to sue governmental employees for negligence, the act is to be strictly construed insofar as it modifies the common law.Methola v. County of Eddy, 1980-NMSC-145, 95 N.M. 329, 622 P.2d 234.\n\nRight to sue and recover under act is limitedto the rights, procedures, limitations and conditions prescribed in this act.Methola v. County of Eddy, 1980-NMSC-145, 95 N.M. 329, 622 P.2d 234.\n\nAgency to be named in complaint.— Under the Tort Claims Act, the particular agency that caused the harm is the party that must be named in the complaint and against whom a judgment may be entered.Begay v. State, 1985-NMCA-117, 104 N.M. 483, 723 P.2d 252,rev'd on other grounds sub nom.,Smialek v. Begay, 1986-NMSC-049, 104 N.M. 375, 721 P.2d 1306, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1020, 93 L. Ed. 2d 727, 107 S. Ct. 677.\n\nProper defendant.— The statutory structure of the Tort Claims Act indicates that either a governmental entity or an individual public employee can be the sole named defendant. The Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 to 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] does not require a plaintiff to name a specific public employee as a defendant to recover damages and a plaintiff may state a claim by naming only a governmental entity.Lopez v. Las Cruces Police Dep't, 2006-NMCA-074, 139 N.M. 730, 137 P.3d 670, cert. denied, 2006-NMCERT-006, 140 N.M. 224, 141 P.3d 1278.\n\nLawsuit alleging claims against county detention center must name board of county commissioners as a defendant.— Where plaintiff filed a lawsuit asserting claims against the Bernalillo county metropolitan detention center (BCMDC) for violations of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (NMTCA) after plaintiff was remanded to BCMDC to participate in a methadone program to decrease his level of dependence so that he would not incur life endangering withdrawal symptoms, but nonetheless suffered life threatening withdrawal symptoms for approximately two months, BCMDC was not a suable entity under the NMTCA, because 4-46-1 NMSA 1978 provides a limitation on the NMTCA, requiring that the proper defendant in all suits against a county is the county's board of county commissioners.Gallegos v. Bernalillo County Board of County Commissioners, 272 F.Supp.3d 1256 (D.N.M. 2017).\n\nDuty and immunity are distinct.— The concepts of duty and immunity are different under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978]. The Act is not a source of duties to be imposed on government entities. Duty or responsibility must be found outside the act either at common law or by statute.Rutherford v. Chaves Cnty., 2002-NMCA-059, 132 N.M. 289, 47 P.3d 448,aff'd2003-NMSC-010, 133 N.M. 756, 69 P.3d 119.\n\nTort is separate and distinct from constitutional deprivation.— The New Mexico legislature recognizes that a tort is separate and distinct from a constitutional deprivation.Wells v. County of Valencia, 1982-NMSC-048, 98 N.M. 3, 644 P.2d 517.\n\nDenial of immunity claim not immediately appealable.— Since Subsection A of this section provides a defense to liability, and not absolute immunity from suit, a denial of a claim of immunity under that section does not meet the requirements for immediate appellate review under the collateral order exception to the traditional requirement of finality.Allen v. Board of Educ., 1987-NMCA-152, 106 N.M. 673, 748 P.2d 516.\n\nLegislature acted within its powers in limiting liability of public employeesin the same manner as it limited the liability of the entity for whom they work.Garcia v. Albuquerque Pub. Schs. Bd. of Educ., 1980-NMCA-081, 95 N.M. 391, 622 P.2d 699, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 426, 622 P.2d 1046 (1981).\n\nSuit against state hospital in federal court not permitted.— Congress does not have the power to make statutes such as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) applicable to state-run hospitals without the state's express consent. As indicated by this section, 41-4-2 NMSA 1978 and 41-4-18 NMSA 1978, New Mexico has not consented to be sued in federal court for violations of EMTALA, nor for any other tort.Ward v. Presbyterian Healthcare Servs., 72 F. Supp. 2d 1285 (D.N.M. 1999).\n\nSuits in federal court.— Although the state has waived its immunity from suit in its own state courts for actions of law enforcement officers, it has not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal courts.Flores v. Long, 926 F. Supp. 166 (D.N.M. 1995),appeal dismissed, 110 F.3d 730 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\nGovernmental entities liable for discriminatory practices.— The Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] does not override or supersede the Human Rights Act [28-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.], so as to shield a governmental entity from liability otherwise flowing from a discriminatory practice proscribed by the latter act. Section 28-1-13D NMSA 1978 constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity for liability imposed on public entities by the human rights commission, or by a district court on appeal from a commission decision, for violations of the Human Rights Act.Luboyeski v. Hill, 1994-NMSC-032, 117 N.M. 380, 872 P.2d 353.\n\nSubpoena power.— The Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] does not protect government actors from a court's subpoena power.Seeds v. Lucero, 2005-NMCA-067, 137 N.M. 589, 113 P.3d 859, cert. deniedsub nom. Seeds v. Vandervossen, 2005-NMCERT-005, 137 N.M. 522, 113 P.3d 345.\n\nLiability question of fact.— Question of whether boy scout troop using school district's swimming pool was a business invitee to whom school district owed duty of reasonable care to avoid risk of harm and question as to negligence of school district for failing to provide lifeguard and safety equipment were questions raising genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment in wrongful action.Seal v. Carlsbad Indep. Sch. Dist., 1993-NMSC-049, 116 N.M. 101, 860 P.2d 743.\n\nDuty to defend.— Where a police officer was sued individually in federal court for violation of plaintiff's constitutional rights; the officer asked the municipality to provide a defense and gave a copy of the complaint to the municipal attorney; the municipality refused to provide a defense, the municipality had actual notice of the federal action and was asked to provide a defense within the time for filing an answer to the complaint; the municipality did not dispute that the officer acted within the scope of the officer's employment; the officer defended the federal action pro se; and the officer and plaintiff settled the federal claims; and plaintiff did not give the municipality written notice of the incident within ninety days after the incident occurred, 41-4-16 NMSA 1978 does not require notice to be given by a claimant who sues, only a governmental employee, and the municipality was required to defend and indemnify the officer and pay the judgment against the officer.Niederstadt v. Town of Carrizozo, 2008-NMCA-053, 143 N.M. 786, 182 P.3d 769, cert. denied 2008-NMCERT-003, 143 N.M. 681, 180 P.3d 1180.\n\nII. IMMUNITY AND WAIVER.\n\nTort Claims Act grants immunity for strict liabilityin tort.McCurry v. City of Farmington, 1982-NMCA-055, 97 N.M. 728, 643 P.2d 292.\n\nSubsection A provides government entities with immunity from liabilityfor any tort, except as waived in other sections of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Bierner v. City of Truth or Consequences, 2004-NMCA-093, 136 N.M. 197, 96 P.3d 322.\n\nPrima facie tort is not includedin the specific provisions of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978]; government entities and public employees acting within the scope of duty therefore enjoy immunity to such claims.Derringer v. State, 2003-NMCA-073, 133 N.M. 721, 68 P.3d 961, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 727, 69 P.3d 237.\n\nTort Claims Act clearly contemplates including employees who abuse their officially authorized duties,even to the extent of some tortious and criminal activity.Celaya v. Hall, 2004-NMSC-005, 135 N.M. 115, 85 P.3d 239.\n\nLiability of governmental entity for torts of employees.— A governmental entity is not immune from liability for any tort of its employee acting within the scope of duties for which immunity is waived.Silva v. State, 1987-NMSC-107, 106 N.M. 472, 745 P.2d 380.\n\nIt is only when a public entity is itself acting through its employee with the right to control the manner in which the details of work are to be done, that the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] comes into play.Silva v. State, 1987-NMSC-107, 106 N.M. 472, 745 P.2d 380.\n\nThe supervision required for naming a public entity includes more than \"direct supervision\"; it includes the right of control regardless of whether exercised.Silva v. State, 1987-NMSC-107, 106 N.M. 472, 745 P.2d 380.\n\nConstructive fraud not basis for waiver.— Constructive fraud is not one of the causes of action for which a city's sovereign immunity is waived under this section.Health Plus v. Harrell, 1998-NMCA-064, 125 N.M. 189, 958 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 145, 958 P.2d 103;Cordova v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2005-NMCA-009, 136 N.M. 713, 104 P.3d 1104.\n\nEconomic compulsion and constructive fraudare not specifically waived by the statute.Valdez v. State, 2002-NMSC-028, 132 N.M. 667, 54 P.3d 71.\n\nImmunity not waived where negligence did not result in enumerated tort or where law enforcement officer did not breach a statutory duty.— Where plaintiff was traveling on a highway in Bloomfield, New Mexico when her vehicle struck an intoxicated pedestrian, and where plaintiff brought suit against defendants alleging negligence based on the fact that a San Juan County deputy left the pedestrian near the highway after taking the pedestrian into custody due to the pedestrian's intoxication, the district court did not err in dismissing plaintiff's tort claim based on its determination that defendant's immunity was not waived because the negligence of the officer did not result in one of the enumerated torts listed in 41-4-12 NMSA 1978, and the deputy's conduct did not breach a statutory duty owed to plaintiff.Milliron v. County of San Juan, 2016-NMCA-096.\n\nWaiver of immunity.— Section 41-4-21 NMSA 1978 was designed to preserve employment relations between the state, or a subdivision thereof, and its employees; it may not be read to expand Subsection A of this section and to provide a waiver of immunity to allow an educational malpractice action against a public school board.Rubio ex rel. Rubio v. Carlsbad Mun. Sch. Dist., 1987-NMCA-127, 106 N.M. 446, 744 P.2d 919.\n\nLimited liability of law enforcement officers.— The clear meaning of this section is that law enforcement officers are not personally liable for malicious or fraudulent torts when committed while acting within the scope of their duties, except as provided in 41-4-12 NMSA 1978.Methola v. County of Eddy, 1980-NMSC-145, 95 N.M. 329, 622 P.2d 234.\n\nEmergency communications center is a \"governmental entity\" for purposes of the Tort Claims Act.— Where plaintiff, a police officer who was injured during a call for service, filed suit for personal injuries against the Valencia regional emergency communications center (VRECC), an entity created pursuant to the New Mexico Enhanced 911 Act, NMSA 1978, §§ 63-9D-1 to 63-9D-11.1, to provide enhanced 911 emergency communications functions for an area that includes the incorporated boundaries of the villages of Los Lunas and Bosque Farms and Valencia county, and where the district court dismissed claims against the VRECC, finding that the VRECC was a governmental entity for purposes of the Tort Claims Act and that immunity had not been waived, the district court did not err in dismissing claims against the VRECC, because the VRECC is an entity created pursuant to statute to provide basic safety and health services on behalf of the villages and Valencia county, is controlled by the villages and Valencia county, and possesses their same powers and duty with regard to the health and welfare of their citizens, and is thus a \"governmental entity\" under the Tort Claims Act.Gebler v. Valencia Reg'l Emergency Commc'n Ctr., 2023-NMCA-070.\n\nImmunity was not waived for emergency communications center.— Where plaintiff, a police officer who was injured during a call for service, filed suit for personal injuries against the Valencia regional emergency communications center (VRECC), an entity created pursuant to the New Mexico Enhanced 911 Act, NMSA 1978, §§ 63-9D-1 to 63-9D-11.1, to provide enhanced 911 emergency communications functions for an area that includes the incorporated boundaries of the villages of Los Lunas and Bosque Farms and Valencia county, and where the district court dismissed claims against the VRECC, finding that the VRECC was a governmental entity for purposes of the Tort Claims Act and that immunity had not been waived, the district court did not err in finding that NMSA 1978, § 41-4-6 did not waive defendant's immunity, because plaintiff did not submit any evidence that raises a question of fact as to any broad problems that implicated the core of how the VRECC was operated, that is, plaintiff did not establish the inadequacy of the training provided to dispatchers, did not assert that the VRECC failed to maintain the physical plant and equipment appropriately, and did not assert that the procedures and protocols in place for handling calls and dispatches were inadequate. The errors alleged by plaintiff are most appropriately deemed simple employee negligence for which § 41-4-6 does not waive immunity.Gebler v. Valencia Reg'l Emergency Commc'n Ctr., 2023-NMCA-070.\n\nWaiver of public employees' immunity not allowed.— Section does not allow an attorney of public employees who enjoy sovereign immunity to waive such immunity at trial.Garcia v. Board of Educ., 777 F.2d 1403 (10th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 814, 107 S. Ct. 66, 93 L. Ed. 2d 24 (1986).\n\nThe New Mexico Tort Claims Act (NMTCA) has not waived CYFD's immunity from suit based on negligent supervision.— Where a mother brought an action against the children, youth and families department (CYFD) based on negligence due to their purported failure to supervise a daycare center, following the death of the mother's child that occurred when the daycare operators left the child in a hot vehicle, the case was dismissed, because the mother cited no applicable NMTCA provision that waives immunity for negligent supervision. Under the NMTCA, New Mexico has made it its public policy that governmental entities and public employees shall only be liable within the limitations of the Tort Claims Act.Tafoya v. New Mexico, 517 F. Supp. 3d 1250 (D. N.M. 2021).\n\nIII. SCOPE OF DUTY.\n\nNo distinction shall be drawn with regard to \"public\" or \"special\" dutyof governmental employees whose immunity to suit for acts of negligence has been excepted under this article.Schear v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1984-NMSC-079, 101 N.M. 671, 687 P.2d 728.\n\nAct provides immunity to public employee acting within scope of duty.— If either district attorney or assistant district attorney was acting within the scope of his duty as a public employee at the time of an alleged defamation, he is immune from liability under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] regardless of any other immunity afforded to a district attorney or assistant district attorney.Candelaria v. Robinson, 1980-NMCA-003, 93 N.M. 786, 606 P.2d 196.\n\nScope of duties/course of employment.— One is not in the course of employment unless the conduct in controversy is of the same general nature as that authorized or incidental thereto.Stull v. City of Tucumcari, 1975-NMCA-105, 88 N.M. 320, 540 P.2d 250, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 319, 540 P.2d 249.\n\nScope of duties.— Under the definition of \"scope of duties\" in Subsection G of 41-4-3 NMSA 1978, when reconciled with the indemnification provisions in Subsection E of this section and Subsection A of 41-4-17 NMSA, an employee's acts are not excluded simply because they are criminal.Risk Mgmt. Div. v. McBrayer, 2000-NMCA-104, 129 N.M. 778, 14 P.3d 43, cert. denied, 130 N.M. 17, 16 P.3d 442.\n\nWhere plaintiff contended that intentional torts are outside the scope of duties of certain state officials, but she failed to specify any actions by the officials which they were not \"requested, required, or authorized to perform,\" defendants were entitled to summary judgment against her on her claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and defamation.Garcia-Montoya v. State Treasurer's Office, 2001-NMSC-003, 130 N.M. 25, 16 P.3d 1084.\n\nHorseplay did not take place in the course and scope of employee's employment.Rivera v. N.M. Hwy. & Transp. Dep't, 1993-NMCA-057, 115 N.M. 562, 855 P.2d 136, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 545, 854 P.2d 872.\n\nFailing to perform a regular duty, such as timely responding to requests for records, still falls with the scope of duties for purposes of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Derringer v. State, 2003-NMCA-073, 133 N.M. 721, 68 P.3d 961, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 727, 69 P.3d 237.\n\nThe defendant failed to show that he was acting in the scope of his duties as a matter of law where his evidence primarily consisted of habit evidence combined with lack of memory and he could not recall anything about his most recent official acts before the accident occurred.Celaya v. Hall, 2003-NMCA-086, 134 N.M. 19, 71 P.3d 1281,aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 2004-NMSC-005, 135 N.M. 115, 85 P.3d 239.\n\nActions outside employment scope.— An officer of the state, who acts outside the scope of authority and in so doing commits a willful and malicious tort, may be held liable for those actions.Allen v. McClellan, 1967-NMSC-114, 77 N.M. 801, 427 P.2d 677,overruled on other grounds by,N.M. Livestock Bd. v. Dose, 1980-NMSC-022, 94 N.M. 68, 607 P.2d 606.\n\nIV. SPECIFIC CASES.\n\nConstitutional claims.— The Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] does not waive immunity for separation of powers for unlawful taxation on unlawful special tax claims.Valdez v. State, 2002-NMSC-028, 132 N.M. 667, 54 P.3d 71.\n\nOperation of a swimming poolis not an inherently dangerous activity giving rise to the strict liability from which a school district and its employees would have enjoyed sovereign immunity under this section for the drowning of a handicapped 18-year-old boy.Seal v. Carlsbad Indep. Sch. Dist., 1993-NMSC-049, 116 N.M. 101, 860 P.2d 743.\n\nCharter schools are public schools subject to the Tort Claims Act.— A charter school is a public school that operates as part of a political subdivision of the state and, as such, is a governmental entity within the meaning of the Tort Claims Act.Kreutzer v. Aldo Leopold High School, 2018-NMCA-005.\n\nWhere plaintiff sued defendant charter school, asserting a negligence claim based on allegations that defendant owed a duty to plaintiff to use ordinary care to keep the premises of its school safe and breached that duty by failing to take reasonable precautions to keep the school safe, the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment and in ruling that defendant is a public school and, as such, a governmental entity subject to suit only as permitted by an exception to the Tort Claims Act's general rule of immunity.Kreutzer v. Aldo Leopold High School, 2018-NMCA-005.\n\nPolice owe no duty to unforeseeable plaintiffs.— As a matter of law, the plaintiffs, children of the deceased killed by law enforcement officers, were unforeseeable as injured parties and, therefore, the defendant officers owed no duty to them.Lucero v. Salazar, 1994-NMCA-066, 117 N.M. 803, 877 P.2d 1106, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 802, 877 P.2d 1105.\n\nNo waiver of immunity for conducting physical agility test prior to employment.— There is no waiver of immunity which can impose liability on a school board or school officers when the plaintiff's decedent, while interviewing for the job of security officer and attempting to complete a physical agility test, suffered a heart attack and subsequently died. The conduction of the physical agility test was an administrative function and, additionally, simple negligence in the performance of a law enforcement officer's duty does not amount to commission of a tort.Tafoya v. Bobroff, 865 F. Supp. 742 (D.N.M. 1994),aff'd, 74 F.3d 1250 (10th Cir. 1996).\n\nLiability where ordinance void.— An officer who makes an arrest for the violation of an ordinance committed in his presence, which by law he is required to make, should not be subjected to liability if thereafter it should be judicially determined that the ordinance was void and in fact no offense had been committed.Miller v. Stinnett, 257 F.2d 910 (10th Cir. 1958).\n\nNegligent release of criminal suspect.— Plaintiff's complaint, claiming personal injuries and damages resulting from rape by a criminal suspect following suspect's allegedly negligent release from a detention center, stated a cause of action against the city which operated the center and against the center director.Abalos v. Bernalillo Cnty. Dist. Attorney's Office, 1987-NMCA-026, 105 N.M. 554, 734 P.2d 794, cert. quashed, 106 N.M. 35, 738 P.2d 907.\n\nLiability for placement of signals and signs.— Because the plaintiff's allegations, in large part, concern the placement of signals and signs, the state of New Mexico does not enjoy immunity for such decisions, and whether signs or signals were necessary is a question for the jury.Blackburn v. State, 1982-NMCA-073, 98 N.M. 34, 644 P.2d 548.\n\nNegligence of city in maintenance of gas service actionable.— If a city negligently maintains a gas service provided by it beyond the statutorily prescribed five-mile limit, that negligence is actionable and there exists no sovereign immunity to shield it from liability under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Cole v. City of Las Cruces, 1983-NMSC-007, 99 N.M. 302, 657 P.2d 629.\n\nNo liability for assault of one citizen by another.— A city is not liable for failure to provide adequate policing to protect one citizen from being assaulted by another citizen. A municipality will not be held liable for failure to carry out either a statutory function or a governmental function.Trujillo v. City of Albuquerque, 1979-NMCA-127, 93 N.M. 564, 603 P.2d 303, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 629, 614 P.2d 546.\n\nGovernment liability for individual assault— Liability for failure to protect one citizen from being assaulted by another citizen would exist only if there had been a specific promise of protection by the police to the victim or if the police officer had affirmatively caused the damage of which the plaintiff was complaining.Trujillo v. City of Albuquerque, 1979-NMCA-127, 93 N.M. 564, 603 P.2d 303, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 629, 614 P.2d 546.\n\nImmunity of state medical examiner.— An allegation of negligent decision-making by the state medical investigator does not fall within an exception to the legislative grant of sovereign immunity contained in the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Begay v. State, 1985-NMCA-117, 104 N.M. 483, 723 P.2d 252,rev'd on other groundssub nom., Smialek v. Begay, 1986-NMSC-049, 104 N.M. 375, 721 P.2d 1306, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1020, 93 L. Ed. 2d 727, 107 S. Ct. 677.\n\nIn an action for damages on the basis of an alleged wrongful decision to perform an autopsy, even if 24-12-4 NMSA 1978, which provides for consent for postmortem examinations, created a private cause of action, it did not override the state medical investigator's grant of immunity under the Tort Claims Act.Begay v. State, 1985-NMCA-117, 104 N.M. 483, 723 P.2d 252,rev'd on other groundssub nom., Smialek v. Begay, 1986-NMSC-049, 104 N.M. 375, 721 P.2d 1306, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1020, 93 L. Ed. 2d 727, 107 S. Ct. 677.\n\nIn an action for damages on the basis of a wrongful decision to perform an autopsy on decedent, causing emotional distress to family members because the body was not handled according to traditional Navajo religious beliefs, a count alleging interference with plaintiffs' free exercise of religion was dismissed since the state had given no consent to be sued and there was no express waiver for the state medical examiner under the Tort Claims Act.Begay v. State, 1985-NMCA-117, 104 N.M. 483, 723 P.2d 252,rev'd on other groundssub nom., Smialek v. Begay, 1986-NMSC-049, 104 N.M. 375, 721 P.2d 1306, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1020, 93 L. Ed. 2d 727, 107 S. Ct. 677.\n\nImmunity of state auditor.— Because state auditor was acting within his scope of duty in commissioning a special audit and publishing the report, no waiver of immunity exists under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] for claims of defamation.Vigil v. State Auditor's Office, 2005-NMCA-096, 138 N.M. 63, 116 P.3d 854, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-007, 138 N.M. 146, 117 P.3d 952.\n\nImmunity of building inspector.— City building inspector who inspected building held to have qualified immunity for equal protection claim, but issue raised as to whether inspector had qualified immunity for fourth amendment and first amendments claims.Mimics, Inc. v. Village of Angel Fire, 277 F. Supp. 2d 1131 (D.N.M. 2003),rev'd on other grounds, 394 F. 3d 836 (10th Cir. 2005).\n\nJeopardy tax assessment.— State officials are not entitled to absolute immunity for jeopardy tax assessments which are primarily investigatory and administrative in nature.Perez v. Ellington, 421 F.3d 1128 (10th Cir. 2005).\n\nIntentional interference with contract.— Under the Tort Claims Act, a governmental entity may not be held liable for damages resulting from the tort of intentional interference with contract.El Dorado Utils., Inc. v. Eldorado Area Water and Sanitation Dist., 2005-NMCA-036, 137 N.M. 217, 109 P.3d 305.\n\nState liability for brine well remediation.— The New Mexico Tort Claims Act, 41-4-1 to 41-4-30 NMSA 1978, provides government immunity while simultaneously creating specific exceptions for which the government might be sued, and therefore, where the New Mexico state legislature introduced a bill proposing to create a political subdivision to oversee and coordinate remediation of a Carlsbad brine well, the state would be immune from liability for any tort associated with its attempts to remediate the Carlsbad brine well, unless the state expressly waives immunity, and the corporate owner of the brine well would remain liable for any damages associated with the sink hole created by the brine well, but given its status under chapter 7 bankruptcy, the owner is likely unable to pay any damages assessed against it.State Liability for Brine Well Remediation(1/30/17), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2017-01.\n\nV. DEFENSE AND INDEMNITY.\n\nA tribal police officer, also commissioned as a county deputy sheriff and acting under his state authority as a deputy sheriff, is a \"public employee\" under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act and is entitled to its benefits.— A tribal officer, who is also commissioned as a county deputy sheriff, is a \"public employee\" under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] when the tribal officer is acting in an official capacity and on behalf or in service of the county, and is therefore entitled to the benefits of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, including a legal defense and indemnification.Loya v. Gutierrez, 2015-NMSC-017,rev'g2014-NMCA-028, 319 P.3d 656.\n\nWhere an on-duty, full time pueblo tribal law enforcement officer, who was also commissioned as a Santa Fe county deputy sheriff, stopped plaintiff's vehicle on a state-maintained highway within the exterior boundaries of the pueblo and arrested plaintiff for reckless driving, the tribal officer was acting under his state authority as a deputy sheriff, not under tribal authority, when he charged, detained, and prosecuted plaintiff under state law; the tribal officer was therefore a \"public employee\" under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act because he was a person acting on behalf or in service of a governmental entity, in an official capacity, whether with or without compensation. As a \"public employee\" under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, the tribal officer was entitled to the benefits of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, including a legal defense and indemnification.Loya v. Gutierrez, 2015-NMSC-017,rev'g2014-NMCA-028, 319 P.3d 656.\n\nA governmental entity must provide a defense when liability is sought against its public employees for violation of federal constitutional rights.— This section requires the governmental entity to provide a defense equally for claims that are torts for which sovereign immunity has been waived and for claims that are not torts, such as federal civil rights claims, for which sovereign immunity has not been waived under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Loya v. Gutierrez, 2015-NMSC-017,rev'g2014-NMCA-028, 319 P.3d 656.\n\nWhere an on-duty, full time pueblo tribal law enforcement officer, who was also commissioned as a Santa Fe county deputy sheriff, stopped plaintiff's vehicle on a state-maintained highway within the exterior boundaries of the pueblo and arrested plaintiff for reckless driving, the tribal officer was acting under his state authority as a deputy sheriff, not under tribal authority, when he charged, detained, and prosecuted plaintiff under state law; the tribal officer was therefore a \"public employee\" under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act because he was a person acting on behalf or in service of a governmental entity, in an official capacity, whether with or without compensation. As a \"public employee\" under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, the tribal officer was entitled to the benefits of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, including a legal defense and indemnification against claims of federal constitutional rights violations.Loya v. Gutierrez, 2015-NMSC-017,rev'g2014-NMCA-028, 319 P.3d 656.\n\nTribal police officer was not a \"public employee\".— Where an on-duty, full-time pueblo tribal law enforcement officer, acting in the officer's capacity as a commissioned deputy sheriff for the county stopped plaintiff's vehicle on a state-maintained road within the exterior boundaries of the pueblo and arrested plaintiff for reckless driving; the officer was dressed in a full tribal police uniform, displaying a tribal badge of office, and driving a tribal police vehicle; in addition to acting under tribal law, the officer was on duty as a duly commissioned deputy sheriff, which gave the officer authority to arrest, charge, and jail non-Indians for violations of New Mexico state laws; the officer took plaintiff to the tribal police department for processing and later transported plaintiff to the county jail; the officer was not a salaried officer employed by the county; the pueblo was a sovereign Indian tribe; plaintiff sued the officer for violation of plaintiff's constitutional rights, the officer was not a \"law enforcement officer\" or a \"public employee\" of a \"governmental entity\" as defined in 40-4-3 NMSA 1978 and the county did not have a duty under 40-4-4 NMSA 1978 to defend or indemnify the officer for tortious acts committed while exercising the officer's authority as a commissioned deputy sheriff.Loya v. Gutierrez, 2014-NMCA-028, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-002.\n\nAttorney fees incurred by an employee in a mandamus actionto compel the employee's governmental employer to appoint independent defense counsel to defend the employee are not recoverable by the employee under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Paz v. Tijerina, 2007-NMCA-109, 142 N.M. 391, 165 P.3d 1167.\n\nDefense for mandamus actions.— Subsection B, requiring that the government provide a defense for employees subject to a claim for liability, does not include providing a defense for mandamus actions.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Risk MgMt. Div., 1995-NMSC-046, 120 N.M. 178, 899 P.2d 1132.\n\nThe Tort Claims Act does not waive immunity from liabilityfor invasions of privacy. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen.

      "text": "The immunity granted pursuant to Subsection A of Section 41-4-4 NMSA 1978 does not apply to liability for damages resulting from bodily injury, wrongful death or property damage caused by the negligence of public employees while acting within the scope of their duties in the operation or maintenance of any motor vehicle, aircraft or watercraft.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-14-5, enacted by Laws 1976, ch. 58, § 5; 1977, ch. 386, § 4.\n\nEmergency clauses.— Laws 1977, ch. 386, § 23 contained an emergency clause and was approved April 8, 1977.\n\nImmunity not waived.— Where the decedent was experiencing the effect of withdrawal from heroin when the metropolitan court ordered his release; the decedent was initially released to be transported by van as required by jail policy, but he exited the van; the decedent re-entered the metropolitan jail; the decedent was released to the jail parking lot without signing a waiver of van transportation contrary to jail policy; the decedent wandered off into the desert and died of hypothermia; and the medical director of the jail opined that at the time of his release, the decedent had no medical condition that required treatment, the city was not liable under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] on plaintiff's claim that the van driver negligently operated the van.Lessen v. City of Albuquerque, 2008-NMCA-085, 144 N.M. 314, 187 P.3d 179, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-005, 144 N.M. 331, 187 P.3d 677.\n\nImmunity not waived where negligence did not result in enumerated tort or where law enforcement officer did not breach a statutory duty.— Where plaintiff was traveling on a highway in Bloomfield, New Mexico when her vehicle struck an intoxicated pedestrian, and where plaintiff brought suit against defendants alleging negligence based on the fact that a San Juan County deputy left the pedestrian near the highway after taking the pedestrian into custody due to the pedestrian's intoxication, the district court did not err in dismissing plaintiff's tort claim based on its determination that defendant's immunity was not waived because the negligence of the officer did not result in one of the enumerated torts listed in this section, and the deputy's conduct did not breach a statutory duty owed to plaintiff.Milliron v. County of San Juan, 2016-NMCA-096.\n\n\"Maintenance of motor vehicles\" construed.— The \"maintenance of motor vehicles\" connotes the act of keeping them safe for public use. Certainly, burning of automobiles is inconsistent with this concept.McCurry v. City of Farmington, 1982-NMCA-055, 97 N.M. 728, 643 P.2d 292.\n\nIn a wrongful death suit, the actions of a state police emergency response officer, in supervising the removal of a privately owned trailer from a highway in a condition that eventually caused the death of plaintiff's decedent, were not within the meaning of \"maintenance\" or \"operation\" as those terms are used in this section and, accordingly, immunity was not waived.Caillouette v. Hercules, Inc., 1992-NMCA-008, 113 N.M. 492, 827 P.2d 1306, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 352, 826 P.2d 573.\n\nOperation of school bus.— Neither the adoption and enforcement of regulations to govern the design and operation of school buses, nor the design, planning and enforcement of safety rules for school bus transportation, fall within the meaning of \"operation\" of a motor vehicle, for purposes of this section.Chee Owens v. Leavitts Freight Serv., Inc., 1987-NMCA-037, 106 N.M. 512, 745 P.2d 1165, cert. deniedsub nom. Chee Owens v. Loshbough, 107 N.M. 106, 753 P.2d 352 (1988).\n\nThe fact that a school district may be immune from liability for alleged improper design, planning and enforcement of school bus transportation procedures does not mean it is immune if one of its drivers negligently operates a bus.Chee Owens v. Leavitts Freight Serv., Inc., 1987-NMCA-037, 106 N.M. 512, 745 P.2d 1165, cert. deniedsub nom. Chee Owens v. Loshbough, 107 N.M. 106, 753 P.2d 352 (1988).\n\nA bus driver, who pulled off the pavement of a highway, across which a child, while attempting to board the bus, ran before being struck by a truck, may have been negligent. Causal connection between the accident and the defendant's action was not resolved and summary judgment in favor of the defendant was improper.Chee Owens v. Leavitts Freight Serv., Inc., 1987-NMCA-037, 106 N.M. 512, 745 P.2d 1165, cert. deniedsub nom. Chee Owens v. Loshbough, 107 N.M. 106, 753 P.2d 352 (1988).\n\nOperation of school bus.— Operation of a school bus under this section includes making decisions, while driving the bus, about whether to stop the vehicle on the pavement, with lights flashing, or off the road. Therefore, when a bus driver decided, while driving the bus each day, not to pick up a child on the child's side of a state road, but to pick the child up on the opposite side on the driver's return trip, that decision constituted operation of the bus; it occurred while the driver was in control of the bus, and it affected the manner in which the driver performed his driving duties.Gallegos v. Sch. Dist. of W. Las Vegas, 1993-NMCA-086, 115 N.M. 779, 858 P.2d 867, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 795, 858 P.2d 1274.\n\nApplicability to law enforcement officers.— This section, which waives immunity for negligent operation or maintenance of a motor vehicle, watercraft, or aircraft, applies to all public employees, including law enforcement officers. Section 41-4-12 NMSA 1978, which applies only to law enforcement officers, waives immunity only for the acts enumerated in that provision, such as assault and battery.Wilson v. Grant Cnty., 1994-NMCA-001, 117 N.M. 105, 869 P.2d 293.\n\nDriving to and from a work-related activity is within the scope of a public employee's duties.— When a public employee is driving to and from a work-related function, such travel benefits the employer and is necessarily \"required, requested or authorized\" within the definition of \"scope of duty\" set forth in the Tort Claims Act.Wright v. Seventh Judicial District Ct., 2024-NMCA-059, cert. denied.\n\nThe district court was vicariously liable for judge's negligence where judge was acting within the scope of her official duties while driving home from a work-related event.— Where plaintiffs filed suit under the Tort Claims Act (TCA), 41-4-1 to 41-4-27 NMSA 1978, against a seventh judicial district court judge and her employer, the seventh judicial district court (SJDC), seeking damages for personal injury and wrongful death after the judge, while driving home from a speaking event for a private contractor who worked with the SJDC by providing a variety of pretrial services for the court including treatments related to the SJDC's adult drug court treatment program, collided with plaintiffs who were cycling along the edge of U.S. Highway 60, and where plaintiffs sought to establish that the judge was acting within the scope of her official duties under the TCA such that the SJDC was vicariously liable for the harms caused in the accident, the district court did not err in granting plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment, finding that, as a matter of law, the judge was acting within the scope of her official duties as a judge in the SJDC at the time her vehicle struck the cyclists, and therefore the SJDC was vicariously liable under the TCA for the injuries the judge caused during the accident, because the judge's attendance at the event, and her associated travel, provided meaningful benefit to the SJDC's mission regarding its drug courts, and therefore the judge's conduct had a sufficient nexus to the duties requested, required, or authorized by the SJDC.Wright v. Seventh Judicial District Ct., 2024-NMCA-059, cert. denied.\n\nImmunity not waived for third-party negligence.— This section does not provide for a waiver of immunity for acts of public employees that cause or allow third parties to negligently operate motor vehicle resulting in injuries.Blea v. City of Espanola, 1994-NMCA-008, 117 N.M. 217, 870 P.2d 755, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 328, 871 P.2d 984.\n\nCollateral estoppel did not apply to preclude plaintiff's state tort claims following federal court dismissal.— Where plaintiff, as the personal representative of decedent's wrongful death estate, brought an action in federal court against the Roosevelt county board of county commissioners, the Roosevelt county sheriff's department, and the Roosevelt county sheriff, alleging deprivations of decedent's rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments through 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as well as causes of action under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (TCA), §§ 41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978, and where the sheriff asserted qualified immunity as a defense to plaintiff's § 1983 claims, and where the federal court granted the sheriff's motion and dismissed all federal claims against all defendants, and where, shortly thereafter, plaintiff filed a complaint in the state district court against the same defendants, alleging claims for negligence and aggravated assault and battery under the TCA, and where defendants moved to dismiss the TCA claims, arguing that because the federal court had already determined that the sheriff acted reasonably, the TCA claims were barred by collateral estoppel because the same standard of \"objective reasonableness\" must apply to plaintiff's TCA claims, the district court erred in applying collateral estoppel to grant defendants' motion to dismiss, because the relevant issues were not actually litigated and necessarily decided in federal court and plaintiff has not had the opportunity to fully and fairly litigate the issues.Hernandez v.

All irrigation and conservancy districts and their public employees acting lawfully and within the scope of their duties that authorize any part of their property to be used as part of trails within a state park, the state trails system or a trail established and managed by a local public body are excluded from the waiver of immunity under Subsection A of this section for damages arising out of the operation or maintenance of such trails if the irrigation or conservancy district has entered into a written agreement with the state agency or local public body operating or maintaining the trail and that state agency or local public body has agreed to assume the operation and maintenance of that portion of the district's property used for the trail; the state agency or local public body operating or maintaining the trail shall be subject to liability as provided in the Tort Claims Act.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-14-6, enacted by Laws 1976, ch. 58, § 6; 1977, ch. 386, § 5; 2007, ch. 207, § 1.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, added Subsection C.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nNo risk to general public.— Defendants' mishandling of a firearm and handcuffs while apprehending plaintiff, did not put the general public at risk, and therefore, immunity was not waived under this section.Oliveros v. Mitchell, 449 F.3d 1091 (10th Cir. 2006).\n\nNegligent performance of administrative function.— Defendant misclassified plaintiff for work in the prison kitchen contrary to his medically ordered restriction prohibiting heavy lifting. Section 41-4-6 NMSA 1978 does not waive immunity when public employees negligently perform such administrative functions.Lymon v. Aramark, 728 F.Supp.2d 1222 (D.N.M. 2010).\n\nDistrict court erred in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment on premises liability claim.— In a wrongful death lawsuit, where plaintiff, as personal representative of the estate of decedent, brought claims against the New Mexico Corrections Department (NMCD) after decedent was killed by an inmate who had been erroneously released from custody, alleging negligent operation of the NMCD facility from which the inmate had been released, and negligent actions by law enforcement officers, and where defendants moved for summary judgment arguing that they were immune from suit under the Tort Claims Act, 41-4-1 to 41-4-30 NMSA 1978, and where the district granted defendant's motion on the premises liability claim on the grounds that there was no allegation in the complaint that the wrongful death occurred in NMCD's facilities or property surrounding and linked to NMCD's facilities, or that NMCD had control and a legal interest in the property where the crime occurred, summary judgment was improperly granted on this ground, because New Mexico's common law has long recognized that premises liability claims can lie for injuries occurring outside a property's boundary. The traditional rule is that one who owns or controls property has a duty to refrain from creating or permitting conditions on such property that will foreseeably lead to an unreasonable risk of harm to others beyond the property's borders.Sanders v. NMDOC, 2023-NMCA-030, cert. denied.\n\nAdministrative decision.— Denial of prisoner's use of the formal grievance process was a discrete administrative decision and does not waive immunity under 41-4-6 NMSA 1978.Lymon v. Aramark, 728 F.Supp.2d 1222 (D.N.M. 2010).\n\nPurpose of section.— This section contemplates waiver of immunity where, due to the alleged negligence of public employees, an injury arises from an unsafe, dangerous, or defective condition on property owned and operated by the government.Rivera v. King, 1988-NMCA-093, 108 N.M. 5, 765 P.2d 1187, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 785, 765 P.2d 758.\n\nStrict liability instruction prohibited.— UJI 13-506, pertaining to liability for dog bites, is a strict liability instruction, thus, it cannot be given to the jury in an action for relief under this section because it does not embody a negligence theory of recovery.Smith v. Village of Ruidoso, 1999-NMCA-151, 128 N.M. 470, 994 P.2d 50.\n\nClaim alleging unconstitutional activities.— In a suit under this article, the individual defendants (state officials) were not stripped of immunity by their alleged unauthorized, unconstitutional activities. Any claim that an individual was not acting within the scope of duties is not a claim under this article.Gallegos v. State, 1987-NMCA-150, 107 N.M. 349, 758 P.2d 299, cert. quashed, 107 N.M. 314, 757 P.2d 370,overruled on other grounds byWilliams v. Cent. Consol. Sch. Dist., 1998-NMCA-006, 124 N.M. 488, 952 P.2d 978.\n\nState prisoner protected.— A prisoner injured in a manner contemplated by the operation of this section is as much a member of the general public as anyone else.Garner v. Department of Corrs., 1995-NMCA-103, 120 N.M. 547, 903 P.2d 858.\n\nStudent's negligent supervision suit disallowed.— This section does not provide a remedy for an injured student to sue a school board on the theory of negligent supervision.Pemberton v. Cordova, 1987-NMCA-020, 105 N.M. 476, 734 P.2d 254,overruled on other grounds byWilliams v. Cent. Consol. Sch. Dist., 1998-NMCA-006, 124 N.M. 488, 952 P.2d 978.\n\nNegligent supervision of student lunch area.— Where plaintiff sued defendant for legal malpractice on the ground that defendant failed to file plaintiff's suit against a public high school and school district within the statute of limitations; defendant claimed that plaintiff would not have prevailed on the underlying claim because the claim would have been barred by sovereign immunity; plaintiff was badly beaten by a classmate in an area outside the school property on a street that the school had cordoned off so that students could patronize food vendors parked in the street; an assistant principal at the school stated that the area where the vendors parked was considered a hot zone for student violence; the area was not monitored by security cameras; and the security guards and teachers assigned to monitor the area were not present at the time plaintiff was attacked, plaintiff established the existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding the presence of a dangerous condition at the high school and summary judgment for defendant on the malpractice claim was inappropriate.Encinias v. Whitener Law Firm, P.A., 2013-NMSC-045,rev'g2013-NMCA-003, 294 P.3d 1245.\n\nWhere plaintiff was attacked during the lunch period at plaintiff's high school by fellow students, one of whom was a suspended student; the attack occurred on a street adjacent to the school that was roped off by the school for lunch vendors to provide food to the students; plaintiff presented evidence that a security guard or teacher usually patrolled the food vendor area, that no security guard or teacher was monitoring the area at the time of the attack, that school personnel knew that the vendor food area was a \"hot zone\" for potential trouble, and that the suspended student had entered the school campus for the purpose of attacking plaintiff; and plaintiff claimed that the school's negligent execution of its safety policies for patrolling the food vendor area during the lunch period and failure to keep a suspended student off campus resulted in plaintiff's injuries, the school did not waive immunity because plaintiff solely alleged negligent supervision and failed to provide sufficient evidence of a dangerous condition requiring supervision.Encinias v. Whitener Law Firm, P.A., 2013-NMCA-003, 294 P.3d 1245, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-012,rev'd, 2013-NMSC-045.\n\nCharter schools are public schools subject to the Tort Claims Act.— A charter school is a public school that operates as part of a political subdivision of the state and, as such, is a governmental entity within the meaning of the Tort Claims Act.Kreutzer v. Aldo Leopold High School, 2018-NMCA-005.\n\nNo waiver of immunity for negligent supervision.— Where plaintiff sued defendant charter school, asserting a negligence claim based on allegations that defendant owed a duty to plaintiff to use ordinary care to keep the premises of its school safe and breached that duty by failing to take reasonable precautions to keep the school safe, the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment, because there is no waiver of immunity under this section for negligent supervision.Kreutzer v. Aldo Leopold High School, 2018-NMCA-005.\n\nNegligent supervision of children by town.— This section did not waive sovereign immunity for a town's failure to exercise ordinary care in the supervision of children who participated in its summer day camp program.Espinoza v. Town of Taos, 1995-NMSC-070, 120 N.M. 680, 905 P.2d 718.\n\nSummary judgment in favor of state police was affirmedin the case of an automobile passenger's action for injuries sustained in a traffic accident following a rock concert, in the absence of any allegations giving rise to a duty on the part of the state police to exercise ordinary care for the passenger's safety.Bober v. N.M. State Fair, 1991-NMSC-031, 111 N.M. 644, 808 P.2d 614.\n\nLoose dogs as unsafe condition.— Under the right circumstances, dogs roaming loose upon the common grounds of a government-operated residential complex could represent an unsafe condition.Castillo v. County of Santa Fe, 1988-NMSC-037, 107 N.M. 204, 755 P.2d 48.\n\nDog-bite victim may pursue negligence claim.— A negligence claim is appropriate where the municipality as dog owner lacks knowledge of the dog's vicious propensities and ineffectively controls the animal in a situation where it would reasonably be expected that injury could occur.Smith v. Village of Ruidoso, 1999-NMCA-151, 128 N.M. 470, 994 P.2d 50.\n\nII. BUILDINGS.\n\nDuty to inspect not tantamount to operation or maintenance.— For premises liability under 41-4-6 NMSA 1978, the governmental entity must be shown to have both a legal interest and control of the property. The element of a legal interest is consistent in case law. Responsibility for inspection may have given the county some measure of control over the property. But the courts have never equated control alone with the specific duty of \"operation or maintenance.\"Cobos v. Dona Ana Cnty. Hous. Auth., 1995-NMCA-132, 121 N.M. 20, 908 P.2d 250.\n\nDuty of care to baseball spectators.— An owner/occupant of a commercial baseball stadium owns a duty that is symmetrical to the duty of the spectator. Spectators must exercise ordinary care to protect themselves from the inherent risk of being hit by a projectile that leaves the field of play and the owner/occupant must exercise ordinary care not to increase that inherent risk.Edward C. v. City of Albuquerque, 2010-NMSC-043, 148 N.M. 646, 241 P.3d 1086,rev'gCrespin v. Albuquerque Baseball Club, LLC, 2009-NMCA-105, 147 N.M. 62, 216 P.3d 827.\n\nThe court declined to adopt the \"baseball rule\", which provides that in the exercise of reasonable care, the proprietor of a ballpark need only provide screening for the area of the field behind home plate where the danger of being struck by a ball is greatest, and that such screening must be of sufficient extent to provide adequate protection for as many spectators as may reasonably be expected to desire such seating in the course of an ordinary game, because comparative negligence principles allow the fact finder to take into account the risks that spectators voluntarily accept when they attend baseball games as well as the ability of stadium owners to guard against unreasonable risks that are not essential to the game itself.Crespin v. Albuquerque Baseball Club, LLC, 2009-NMCA-105, 147 N.M. 62, 216 P.3d 827,rev'd,Edward C. v. City of Albuquerque, 2010-NMSC-043, 148 N.M. 646, 241 P.3d 1086.\n\nImmunity not waived.— Where the decedent was experiencing the effect of withdrawal from heroin when the metropolitan court ordered his release; the decedent was initially released to be transported by van as required by jail policy, but he exited the van; the decedent re-entered the metropolitan jail; the decedent was released to the jail parking lot without signing a waiver of van transportation contrary to jail policy; the decedent wandered off into the desert and died of hypothermia; and the medical director of the jail opined that at the time of his release, the decedent had no medical condition that required treatment, the city was not liable under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] on plaintiff's claim that the city negligently operated and maintained the jail.Lessen v. City of Albuquerque, 2008-NMCA-085, 144 N.M. 314, 187 P.3d 179, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-005, 144 N.M. 331, 187 P.3d 677.\n\nResidence of adopted child.Where a state adoption agency had a duty to make home visits to ensure that the home was safe for the adopted child, but did not have a duty to operate and maintain the residential building where the child lived, the adoption agency was not subject to liability under the operation and maintenance of a building exception.Johnson ex rel. Estate of Cano v. Holmes, 377 F. Supp. 2d 1069 (D.N.M. 2004),aff'd455 F. 3d 1133 (10th Cir. 2006).\n\nControl of a licensed foster placement building as operation.— The court declined to broaden the waiver in Section 41-4-6 NMSA 1978 to apply to the negligent failure of the children, youth and families department, after an evaluation by the department to disclose post-adoption knowledge of the violent tendencies of the adopted child or urging the adoptive parents to take their adopted child back into their home.Young v. Van Duyne, 2004-NMCA-074, 135 N.M. 695, 92 P.3d 1269.\n\nOperation or maintenance of buildings.— The department of corrections was not a proper defendant in a wrongful death suit arising out of the escape of state prisoners, who killed a store owner during a robbery, since the injury alleged did not occur due to a physical defect in a building, as contemplated by this section.Wittkowski v. State, Corr. Dep't, 1985-NMCA-066, 103 N.M. 526, 710 P.2d 93, cert. quashed, 103 N.M. 446, 708 P.2d 1047,overruled on other grounds bySilva v. State, 1987-NMSC-107, 106 N.M. 472, 745 P.2d 380.\n\nThe \"maintenance of any building\" includes keeping the grounds of a public housing project safe from unreasonable risk of harm to its residents and invitees.Castillo v. County of Santa Fe, 1988-NMSC-037, 107 N.M. 204, 755 P.2d 48.\n\nWaiver of immunity under this section applies to maintenance of school grounds as well as to the school building itself.Schleft v. Board of Educ., 1989-NMCA-087, 109 N.M. 271, 784 P.2d 1014, cert. denied, 109 N.M. 232, 784 P.2d 419.\n\nWhile this section may appropriately be termed a \"premises liability\" statute, the liability envisioned by the statute is not limited to claims caused by injuries occurring on or off a certain \"premises,\" as the words \"machinery\" and \"equipment\" reveal. Moreover, liability is predicated not only on \"maintenance\" of a piece of publicly owned property, such as a building, park, or item of machinery or equipment, but it also arises from the \"operation\" of any such property.Bober v. N.M. State Fair, 1991-NMSC-031, 111 N.M. 644, 808 P.2d 614.\n\nThis section applies to \"any building,\" public or private, that public employees have a duty to operate and maintain with ordinary care.Cobos v. Dona Ana Cnty. Hous. Auth., 1998-NMSC-049, 126 N.M. 418, 970 P.2d 1143.\n\nWhere victim's injury was caused by county's failure to correct a dangerous condition created when waste transfer facility was constructed, facility came within the waiver of liability in this section negligent operation and maintenance of county facility.Romero v. Valencia Cnty., 2003-NMCA-019, 133 N.M. 214, 62 P.3d 305.\n\nWhere the child suffered from asthma; the child's parents informed the child's physical education teacher about the child's asthmatic condition; the physical education teacher agreed that the child could limit participation if the child felt that the physical exercise was triggering an attack; the child's parents noted the child's condition in the child's Individualizing Education Plan with the school; the child's parents gave consent so school personnel could immediately call medical personnel directly in the event of an attack; on the day of the child's death, a substitute physical education teacher required exercise that was more strenuous than normal; the child began having difficulty breathing and became red in the face; when the child asked the substitute teacher for permission to stop, the teacher refused; after the physical education class, the child collapsed; it took the school fifteen minutes to call 911; school personnel tried to give the child an inhaler treatment but did not administer CPR even though the child was not breathing well and was turning blue, the school district's failure to implement the child's Individualizing Education Plan and the specific assurances given to the child's parents about the care the school was to provide in light of the child's special needs created a dangerous condition in the operation of the school for all special-needs children at the school and the school district's failure to respond adequately to the emergency created a dangerous condition for every student at the school.Upton v. Clovis Mun. Sch. Dist., 2006-NMSC-040, 140 N.M. 205, 141 P.3d 1259,rev'g2005-NMCA-085, 137 N.M. 779, 115 P.3d 795.\n\nImmunity waived where failure to follow school policy created a dangerous condition in the operation of a school and caused child's injury.— Plaintiff, as next friend of his minor child, brought a personal injury claim against the Carlsbad municipal school district and Carlsbad municipal school board (defendants), claiming that defendants failure to follow school policy created a dangerous condition in the operation of the school and caused the minor child's injury, and where defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiff's claims amounted to a claim of negligent supervision, for which there is no Tort Claims Act waiver of immunity, the district court erred in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment, because the evidence established that the school had operational procedures and unwritten policies addressing the process of supervising medically restricted students, but that these procedures may not have been properly implemented. A reasonable jury could find that the school's failures created a dangerous condition for the child and other physically restricted students, and therefore there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether defendants' actions created an operational failure in its polices and procedure pursuant to the building waiver of the Tort Claims Act.VanHorn v. Carlsbad Mun. Schs., 2024-NMCA-035, cert. denied.\n\nImmunity was not waived for emergency communications center.— Where plaintiff, a police officer who was injured during a call for service, filed suit for personal injuries against the Valencia regional emergency communications center (VRECC), an entity created pursuant to the New Mexico Enhanced 911 Act, NMSA 1978, §§ 63-9D-1 to 63-9D-11.1, to provide enhanced 911 emergency communications functions for an area that includes the incorporated boundaries of the villages of Los Lunas and Bosque Farms and Valencia county, and where the district court dismissed claims against the VRECC, finding that the VRECC was a governmental entity for purposes of the Tort Claims Act and that immunity had not been waived, the district court did not err in finding that NMSA 1978, § 41-4-6 did not waive defendant's immunity, because plaintiff did not submit any evidence that raises a question of fact as to any broad problems that implicated the core of how the VRECC was operated, that is, plaintiff did not establish the inadequacy of the training provided to dispatchers, did not assert that the VRECC failed to maintain the physical plant and equipment appropriately, and did not assert that the procedures and protocols in place for handling calls and dispatches were inadequate. The errors alleged by plaintiff are most appropriately deemed simple employee negligence for which § 41-4-6 does not waive immunity.Gebler v. Valencia Reg'l Emergency Commc'n Ctr., 2023-NMCA-070.\n\nImmunity waived when relationship exists between a state agency and facilities in which children are placed.— Where plaintiffs, participants in Tierra Blanca ranch high country youth program (TBR), a private, for-profit youth program in New Mexico that provides troubled adolescent residents with schooling, counseling, and therapy, filed a complaint against the children, youth, and families department (CYFD) alleging that while they were participants in TBR's program, they were physically and emotionally abused by TBR staff and other participants, the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of CYFD on the ground that CYFD was immune from suit under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, because the building waiver in 41-4-6(A) NMSA 1978 permits suit when there is a duty of care created by a relationship between the parties and may apply when an agency undertakes to provide housing for clients when permitted or required to do so under specific statutory authority, because CYFD has a statutory and regulatory obligation to house children in its care in homes or facilities that meet certain minimum health and safety standards, and because the questions of whether and under what circumstances children were placed at TBR by CYFD presented disputed material factual issues.Quevedo v. Children, Youth & Families Dep't, 2016-NMCA-101, cert. denied.\n\nOperation of foster home.— Because plaintiff specifically alleges that the department knew or should have known before the child's placement for adoption in the adoptive parents' home that the child was capable of violent and uncontrolled behavior and that such behavior was likely to occur without therapeutic intervention, plaintiff must be permitted to proceed on the merits of his claim that department operated the foster home within the meaning of the immunity waiver in this section.Young v. Van Duyne, 2004-NMCA-074, 135 N.M. 695, 92 P.3d 1269.\n\nUnsafe, dangerous or defective property conditions.— The waiver of immunity under this section may arise from an unsafe, dangerous, or defective condition on property owned and operated by the government.Castillo v. County of Santa Fe, 1988-NMSC-037, 107 N.M. 204, 755 P.2d 48.\n\nPlaintiff did not qualify as a subsequent purchaser of property and was therefore not owed a duty of care by contractor.— Where the district court granted summary judgement and dismissed plaintiff's claim for negligence against defendants for defects to property constructed by defendants and purchased through foreclosure by plaintiff, a single asset entity specifically created to take control over the property, summary judgment was proper, because plaintiff, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the original lender, was not a subsequent purchaser to whom defendants owed an independent duty of care. Plaintiff is limited to the contractual remedies bargained for in the construction contract.NM-Emerald, LLC v. Interstate Dev., LLC, 2021-NMCA-020.\n\nNegligent design claims.— This section does not waive immunity for a plaintiff's claims of negligent design.Rivera v. King, 1988-NMCA-093, 108 N.M. 5, 765 P.2d 1187, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 785, 765 P.2d 758;Callaway v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 1994-NMCA-049, 117 N.M. 637, 875 P.2d 393, cert. denied, 118 N.M. 90, 879 P.2d 91.\n\nIn an action against a county race track by a jockey who was injured when his horse veered, causing him to fall and strike a post and track rail, the trial court correctly ruled that failure to correct an alleged hazardous condition caused by an exposed gooseneck rail did not constitute a design defect, but rather the case involved whether the rail was safe and related to the operation and maintenance of the track.Yardman v. San Juan Downs, Inc., 1995-NMCA-106, 120 N.M. 751, 906 P.2d 742, cert. denied, 120 N.M. 636, 904 P.2d 1061.\n\nThere is no exception to premises liability for defects originating in design.Williams v. Central Consol. Sch. Dist., 1998-NMCA-006, 124 N.M. 488, 952 P.2d 978.\n\nA school district could be held liable for negligence in failing to correct a dangerous condition in a building regardless of whether the condition originated in a defect in design.Williams v. Central Consol. Sch. Dist., 1998-NMCA-006, 124 N.M. 488, 952 P.2d 978.\n\nLife guards.— Failure of a city to provide adequate life guard protection, which resulted in plaintiff's injury, came within the ambit of negligent \"operation\" of a municipal swimming pool, and, therefore, there was a waiver of sovereign immunity.Leithead v. City of Santa Fe, 1997-NMCA-041, 123 N.M. 353, 940 P.2d 459.\n\nInspection of foods and food processing.— The waiver of immunity for the negligence of public employees in the operation or maintenance of any building does not include the inspections of foods and food manufacturing or processing operations.Martinez v. Kaune Corp., 1987-NMCA-131, 106 N.M. 489, 745 P.2d 714, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 439, 744 P.2d 912,overruled on other grounds byWilliams v. Cent. Consol. Sch. Dist., 1998-NMCA-006, 124 N.M. 488, 952 P.2d 978.\n\nOperation and maintenance of penitentiary.— The \"operation\" and \"maintenance\" of the penitentiary premises, as these terms are used in this section, does not include the security, custody, and classification of inmates. The purpose of this section is to ensure the general public's safety by requiring public employees to exercise reasonable care in maintaining and operating the physical premises owned and operated by the government. The prison official in this case was not operating and maintaining the prison's physical premises when the official negligently classified the plaintiff as an inmate that could be released into the general prison population. Rather, the official was performing an administrative function associated with the operation of the corrections system. This section does not waive immunity when public employees negligently perform such administrative functions.Archibeque v. Moya, 1993-NMSC-079, 116 N.M. 616, 866 P.2d 344.\n\nPlaintiff's complaint plausibly suggested negligence that threatened similarly situated inmates.— Where plaintiff, a pretrial detainee in the custody of Eddy county detention center (ECDC), filed a complaint alleging that he suffered from a partial right foot amputation and that ECDC personnel withheld from him regular and necessary changes of socks and shoes, and denied him the use of his own orthotic device that was to go into his shoe and protect his foot stump, and that as a result of ECDC's actions, plaintiff was required to walk with his bare feet on the bare floor of his cell, on his partially amputated foot stump, causing his feet to crack and ulcerate, and because the floor of his cell was not cleaned or disinfected, plaintiff's foot stump became infected, ultimately resulting in a below the knee amputation of his right foot and leg, and where defendants filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that plaintiff failed to plead facts illustrating the required risk to the general public or a class of users of the building and that plaintiff pleaded facts indicating a condition only risky to him, defendants' motion to dismiss was denied, because plaintiff's complaint put forth factual allegations that suggest that county employees ignored information plaintiff gave them about his medical condition, failed to address such special medical needs, and failed to follow appropriate safety procedures and established policy, making it more likely that all similarly situated inmates were at risk as well. Such a failure amounts to a dangerous condition that threatens a class of incarcerated inmates with medical issues.Reno v. Board of County Comm'rs for County of Eddy, 577 F. Supp.3d 1204 (D. N.M. 2022).\n\nPrisoner's suit for injuries caused by other inmates.— In a suit brought by a former penitentiary inmate for damages resulting from injuries sustained when the inmate was assaulted by other inmates, the state was not liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior. If immunity had been waived, the particular agency that caused the harm (i.e., the corrections department) could have been held liable for the negligent act or omission of its public employees, but not the state.Gallegos v. State, 1987-NMCA-150, 107 N.M. 349, 758 P.2d 299, cert. quashed, 107 N.M. 314, 757 P.2d 370,overruled on other grounds byWilliams v. Central Consol. Sch. Dist., 1998-NMCA-006, 124 N.M. 488, 952 P.2d 978.\n\nThis section did not provide a waiver of immunity for a claim by a former inmate, that he was injured by a mop wringer wielded by another inmate. No claim was made that any physical defect existed with the mop wringer or that a defect caused the plaintiff's injuries.Gallegos v. State, 1987-NMCA-150, 107 N.M. 349, 758 P.2d 299, cert. quashed, 107 N.M. 314, 757 P.2d 370,overruled on other grounds byWilliams v. Cent. Consol. Sch. Dist., 1998-NMCA-006, 124 N.M. 488, 952 P.2d 978.\n\nThis section contemplates waiver of immunity if due to the alleged negligence of public employees an injury arises from an unsafe, dangerous, or defective condition on property owned and operated by the government. The plaintiff states a claim sufficient to waive immunity under this section because the defendants (department of corrections and prison guards) knew or should have known that roaming gang members with a known propensity for violence had access to potential weapons in the recreation area, that such gang members created a dangerous condition on the premises of the penitentiary, and that the danger to other inmates was foreseeable.Callaway v. N.M. Dep't of Corr., 1994-NMCA-049, 117 N.M. 637, 875 P.2d 393, cert. denied, 118 N.M. 90, 879 P.2d 91.\n\nIII. PUBLIC PARKS.\n\nCondition creating risk to general public.— The policy of the state fair officials to require security officers to blindly follow instructions of parking attendants to eject persons from fairgrounds property created a potentially dangerous condition and, in a case when the negligence of parking attendants combined with that policy to cause injury to the plaintiff, immunity of the state fair was waived.Baca v. State, 1996-NMCA-021, 121 N.M. 395, 911 P.2d 1199.\n\nOriginal purpose of recreational park not controlling.— Sovereign immunity was waived since the plaintiff was injured by diving off a raft in a lake at a park even though the original purpose of the lake may have been for storage and diversion of water. Under the lease between the stream commission (owner) and the recreation division (lessee), the park was to be used \"for recreational purposes and for no other purpose,\" the park was not used for diversion or storage of water at the time of the accident, but the park was in fact used only for swimming, diving, boating, fishing, and other recreational activities.Bell v. N.M. Interstate Stream Comm'n, 1993-NMCA-164, 117 N.M. 71, 868 P.2d 1296, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 121, 869 P.2d 820 (1994).\n\nState fairgroundconstituted a \"building or public park\" the negligent operation or maintenance of which, if it led to an unsafe or dangerous condition on the property, would give rise to liability under this section.Bober v. N.M. State Fair, 1991-NMSC-031, 111 N.M. 644, 808 P.2d 614.\n\nState fair was not immune from liability under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] for injuries sustained by a passenger in an automobile involved in an accident arising from a large number of cars exiting the fairgrounds onto a city street following a rock concert held on state fairground premises leased by concert promoter.Bober v. N.M. State Fair, 1991-NMSC-031, 111 N.M. 644, 808 P.2d 614.\n\nIV. MACHINERY.\n\nOperation of machinery and equipment.— This section by its terms operates as a waiver of immunity for claims arising from the operation of machinery and equipment.Garner v. Department of Corrs., 1995-NMCA-103, 120 N.M. 547, 903 P.2d 858.\n\nThis section applied to a prisoner's claim for injures sustained in the prison industries paint shop, allegedly due to failure to provide the prisoner with safety glasses or training in the use of an electric wire brush, because the claim did not relate to administrative functions of the corrections system, such as supervision and classification of prisoners, but related to the operation or maintenance of machinery or equipment.Garner v. Department of Corrs., 1995-NMCA-103, 120 N.M. 547, 903 P.2d 858.\n\n\"Maintenance\" or \"operation\" of a vehicle.— In a wrongful death suit, the actions of a state police emergency response officer, in supervising the removal of a privately owned trailer from a highway in a condition that eventually caused the death of plaintiff's decedent, were not within the meaning of \"maintenance\" or \"operation\" as those terms are used in this section and, accordingly, immunity was not waived.Caillouette v. Hercules, Inc., 1992-NMCA-008, 113 N.M. 492, 827 P.2d 1306, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 352, 826 P.2d 573.\n\nV. EQUIPMENT AND FURNISHINGS.\n\nNegligent maintenance of equipment may include failure to act.Rickerson v. State, 1980-NMCA-050, 94 N.M. 473, 612 P.2d 703, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 675, 615 P.2d 992.\n\nPlacement of signals and signs.— Where the plaintiff's allegations, in large part, concern the placement of signals and signs, the state of New Mexico does not enjoy immunity for such decisions, and whether signs or signals were necessary is a question for the jury.Blackburn v. State, 1982-NMCA-073, 98 N.M. 34, 644 P.2d 548.\n\nFire trucks and all pertinent equipmentcould be included in the phrase \"machinery, equipment and furnishings.\"McCurry v. City of Farmington, 1982-NMCA-055, 97 N.M. 728, 643 P.2d 292.\n\nVI. IRRIGATION AND CONSERVANCY FACILITIES.\n\nOperation of lake used for water diversion or storage.— A father could not maintain an action against state agencies for injuries caused to son while tubing on a man-made lake which was used for the diversion or storage of water. The statutory immunity found in the first sentence of this section must give way to the more specific statutory provisions in the second sentence which reestablishes immunity in \"works used for diversion or storage of water\".Allocca v. N.M. Dep't of Energy Minerals & Natural Res., 1994-NMCA-117, 118 N.M. 668, 884 P.2d 824, cert. denied, 118 N.M. 731, 885 P.2d 1325.\n\nOperation of lake used for both recreation and diversion and storage purposes.— Since water diversion and storage were among the current uses of a lake which was also used for recreational purposes, government entities and their employees responsible for the existence and maintenance of the park in which the lake was located were entitled to immunity.Bell v. N.M. Interstate Stream Comm'n, 1996-NMCA-010, 121 N.M. 328, 911 P.2d 222.\n\nThe Parks and Recreation Division was entitled to governmental immunity under this section; the Elephant Butte Reservoir is a \"works used for diversion or storage of water\" for the purposes of this section, although the state operates the area as a recreational park.Chaleunphonh v. Parks & Recreation Div., 1996-NMCA-066, 121 N.M. 801, 918 P.2d 717, cert. denied, 121 N.M. 783, 918 P.2d 369.\n\nLiability arising from the maintenance of water diversion channels.— The natural interpretation of the second sentence of this section is that it preserves immunity with respect to damages arising out of the operation and maintenance of works used for diversion or storage of water in public parks and on the grounds of public buildings. The immunity preserved by this sentence does not, however, extend to liability arising from the maintenance of diversion channels on public property in general.Espander v. City of Albuquerque, 1993-NMCA-031, 115 N.M. 241, 849 P.2d 384,overruled on other grounds byBybee v. City of Albuquerque, 1995-NMCA-061, 120 N.M. 17, 896 P.2d 1164.\n\nThe city was immune from liability for injuries caused when the plaintiff stepped in a flood control diversion channel running through a city park.Bybee v. City of Albuquerque, 1995-NMCA-061, 120 N.M. 17, 896 P.2d 1164 (overrulingCity of Albuquerque v. Redding, 1980-NMSC-011, 93 N.M. 757, 605 P.2d 1156 andEspander v. City of Albuquerque, 1993-NMCA-031, 115 N.M. 241, 849 P.2d 384).\n\nOperation of canals and ditches by irrigation district immune.— This section does not waive immunity for the operation of canals and ditches by an irrigation district.Tompkins v. Carlsbad Irrigation Dist., 1981-NMCA-072, 96 N.M. 368, 630 P.2d 767.\n\nPlaintiffs' claim against a state irrigation district for injuries sustained by their son while playing near an irrigation ditch on state land was barred by the Tort Claims Act because an injury in an irrigation ditch falls within the exception to the state's waiver of immunity set forth in this section for injuries that arise out of \"the operation or maintenance of works used for diversion or storage of water.\"Noriega v. Stahmann Farms, Inc., 1992-NMCA-010, 113 N.M. 441, 827 P.2d 156, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 449, 827 P.2d 837.\n\nUnsafe, dangerous or defective property conditions.— This section probably waives immunity where, due to public employee negligence, an injury arises from an unsafe, dangerous or defective condition on governmental property. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-13.\n\nLaw reviews.— For survey, \"Torts: Sovereign and Governmental Immunity in New Mexico,\" see 6 N.M. L.

Town of Bernalillo, 1983-NMCA-053, 99 N.M. 737, 663 P.2d 713 (decided prior to 2011 amendment).\n\n\"Operation\" of public utilities and services.— The inspection by a city of a private sewer clean-out at the time of its initial construction is not part of the \"operation\" of a liquid waste collection or disposal utility for the purposes of Subsection A and is not activity for which sovereign immunity is waived.Adams v. Japanese Car Care, 1987-NMCA-113, 106 N.M. 376, 743 P.2d 635.\n\nFire department is not a public utilityand the legislature intended the application of this section only to public utilities.McCurry v. City of Farmington, 1982-NMCA-055, 97 N.M. 728, 643 P.2d 292.\n\nRunoff water.— Paragraph B(2) of this section did not preserve a city's immunity for liability arising from property damage and personal injury caused by flooding onto resident's property by water that came from a city arroyo. This paragraph does not include runoff water.Espander v. City of Albuquerque, 1993-NMCA-031, 115 N.M. 241, 849 P.2d 384,overruled on other grounds byBybee v. City of Albuquerque, 1995-NMCA-061, 120 N.M. 17, 896 P.2d 1164.\n\nStorm runoff water was not \"liquid waste\" and, therefore, a flood control diversion channel carrying the runoff was not a public utility for which immunity is waived under this section.Bybee v. City of Albuquerque, 1995-NMCA-061, 120 N.M. 17, 896 P.2d 1164 (overrulingCity of Albuquerque v. Redding, 1980-NMSC-011, 93 N.M. 757,605 P.2d 1156 andEspander v.

      "text": "A. The immunity granted pursuant to Subsection A of Section 41-4-4 NMSA 1978 does not apply to liability for damages resulting from bodily injury, wrongful death or property damage caused by the negligence of public employees while acting within the scope of their duties during the construction, and in subsequent maintenance, of any bridge, culvert, highway, roadway, street, alley, sidewalk or parking area.\n\nB. The liability for which immunity has been waived pursuant to Subsection A of this section shall not include liability for damages caused by:\n\n(1) a defect in plan or design of any bridge, culvert, highway, roadway, street, alley, sidewalk or parking area;\n\n(2) the failure to construct or reconstruct any bridge, culvert, highway, roadway, street, alley, sidewalk or parking area; or\n\n(3) a deviation from standard geometric design practices for any bridge, culvert, highway, roadway, street, alley, sidewalk or parking area allowed on a case-by-case basis for appropriate cultural, ecological, economic, environmental, right-of-way through Indian lands, historical or technical reasons; provided that the deviation:\n\n(a) is required by extraordinary circumstances;\n\n(b) has been approved by the governing authority; and\n\n(c) is reasonable and necessary as determined by the application of sound engineering principles taking into consideration the appropriate cultural, ecological, economic, environmental, right-of-way through Indian lands, historical or technical circumstances.\n\nC. All irrigation and conservancy districts that authorize a portion of their property to be used as a road available for use by the general public, and their employees acting lawfully and within the scope of their duties, are excluded from the waiver of immunity under Subsection A of this section in regard to that portion of property; provided that the:\n\n(1) irrigation or conservancy district has entered into a written agreement with the state agency or governmental entity operating and maintaining that road; and\n\n(2) state agency or governmental entity has agreed to assume the operation and maintenance of that portion of the district's property used for that road.\n\nD. The state agency or governmental entity operating and maintaining the road available for use by the general public pursuant to Subsection C of this section shall be subject to liability as provided in the Tort Claims Act.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-14-11, enacted by Laws 1976, ch. 58, § 11; 1977, ch. 386, § 8; 1991, ch. 205, § 2; 2019, ch. 104, § 1.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective June 14, 2019, provided an exclusion from the waiver of immunity for irrigation and conservancy districts that authorize a portion of their property for use as a roadway by the public or a governmental entity, and provided that a state agency or governmental entity operating and maintaining the road owned by these districts is subject to liability as provided in the Tort Claims Act; and added Subsections C and D.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective July 1, 1991, in Subsection A, substituted \"41-4-4 NMSA 1978\" for \"14-4 NMSA 1953\" and substituted \"duties during the construction, and in subsequent maintenance of any bridge\" for \"duties in the maintenance of or for the existence of any bridge\"; and, in Subsection B, added Paragraph (3) and made a related stylistic change.\n\nSlip and fall instruction.— Where plaintiff tripped and fell over a city water meter in an alley, the court erred in refusing to give the basic slip and fall instruction, UJI 1318 NMRA, together with UJI 13-1317 NMRA, which states the general duty of a city to maintain its alleys in a safe condition, because the slip and fall instruction includes the elements that a city has a duty to maintain alleys in a safe condition whether or not a dangerous condition is obvious and whether or not the city has notice of any condition that it would have discovered upon reasonable inspection.Benavidez v. City of Gallup, 2007-NMSC-026, 141 N.M. 808, 161 P.3d 853.\n\nPurpose of section.— This section must be construed to effectuate its remedial purpose of ensuring that highways are made safe and kept safe for the traveling public.Rutherford v. Chaves Cnty., 2003-NMSC-010, 133 N.M. 756, 69 P.3d 1199.\n\nTraditional concepts of negligence.— Liability under this act is premised on traditional concepts of negligence.Lujan v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2015-NMCA-005, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nRequirements of negligence action.— A negligence action under this act requires that there be a duty owed from the defendant to the plaintiff, that based on a standard of reasonable care under the circumstances, the defendant breached that duty, and that the breach was a cause in fact and proximate cause of the plaintiff's damages.Lujan v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2015-NMCA-005, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nDuty of ordinary care.— The state has a duty to exercise ordinary care in the maintenance of its highways, but foreseeability is not a factor to consider when determining the existence of a duty and is relevant only to determining whether there is a breach of duty.Lujan v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2015-NMCA-005, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nQuestions of fact for a jury.— Whether a defendant breached the duty of ordinary care and whether an act or omission may be deemed a proximate cause of an injury are questions of fact for a jury to decide.Lujan v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2015-NMCA-005, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nWrongful death action.— In a wrongful death action, where the state department of transportation had a duty to maintain roadways in a safe condition for the benefit of the public, including reasonable inspections of roadways in order to identify and remove dangerous debris, and where department failed to exercise ordinary care in its duty, there were questions of fact as to whether the department had constructive notice of the dangerous debris, whether the department breached a duty to decedent, and whether the department's failure to act was the proximate cause of the accident, making summary judgment improper.Lujan v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2015-NMCA-005, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nThe legislature did not intend design immunity to continue in perpetuity.Martinez v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2013-NMSC-005, 296 P.3d 468,rev'g2011-NMCA-082, 150 N.M. 204, 258 P.3d 483.\n\nRemediation measures are maintenance.— Maintenance is not limited to upkeep and repair. The duty to maintain a roadway subsumes within it a duty to remediate a known, dangerous condition, regardless of whether the source of that danger can be traced back to a design feature. It requires a reasonable response to the known dangerous condition on a roadway. When the reasonableness of that response pertains to traffic controls, it is not measured just by size and weight, permanence or mobility, whether the defect is a structural element or is more transitory in nature.Martinez v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2013-NMSC-005, 296 P.3d 468,rev'g2011-NMCA-082, 150 N.M. 204, 258 P.3d 483.\n\nWhere a state road was designed partially with and partially without center lane barriers to prevent cross-over collisions; while passing another car, the driver of a car in the eastbound lane lost control of the car, skidded, and collided head-on with the decedents' car in the west bound lane; barriers were not installed at the site of the cross-over collision; and plaintiffs offered evidence of other cross-median, fatal collisions that had occurred within the two mile stretch of road that included the site of the collision and citizen complaints regarding the lack of a center barrier, defendant's decision not to install post-construction barriers at the site of the collision, after being alerted of a potentially dangerous condition at the general location of the collision, was a matter of maintenance, not of design.Martinez v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2013-NMSC-005, 296 P.3d 468,rev'g2011-NMCA-082, 150 N.M. 204, 258 P.3d 483.\n\nRelevant evidence of dangerous condition.— Depending on the particular characteristics of the road, evidence of other collisions occurring in the general area of a particular collision or in other areas with similar characteristics, may be relevant to whether the department of transportation was on notice of a dangerous condition.Martinez v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2013-NMSC-005, 296 P.3d 468,rev'g2011-NMCA-082, 150 N.M. 204, 258 P.3d 483.\n\nWhere a state road was designed partially with and partially without center lane barriers to prevent cross-over collisions; while passing another car, the driver of a car in the east bound lane lost control of the car, skidded, and collided head-on with the decedents' car in the west bound lane; barriers were not installed at the site of the cross-over collision; and plaintiffs offered evidence of other cross-median, fatal collisions that had occurred within the two mile stretch of road that include the site of the collision and citizen complaints regarding the lack of a center barrier to show that defendant negligently failed to remedy a dangerous condition when it chose not to install cross-over barriers after it had been put on notice of a dangerous condition, the district court erred in limiting the evidence to the site of the collision.Martinez v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2013-NMSC-005, 296 P.3d 468,rev'g2011-NMCA-082, 150 N.M. 204, 258 P.3d 483.\n\nPurpose of waiver of sovereign immunity in maintenance of highwaysis to protect the public.Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Tucker, 1980-NMCA-082, 95 N.M. 56, 618 P.2d 894.\n\n\"Maintenance\"as used in this section means upkeep and repair.Cardoza v. Town of Silver City, 1981-NMCA-061, 96 N.M. 130, 628 P.2d 1126, cert. denied, 96 N.M. 116, 628 P.2d 686 ;Smith v. Village of Corrales, 1985-NMCA-121, 103 N.M. 734, 713 P.2d 4, cert. denied, 103 N.M. 740, 713 P.2d 556 (1986).\n\nThe 1991 legislative amendment specifically repudiated the decision of the New Mexico Supreme Court inMiller v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 1987-NMSC-081, 106 N.M. 253, 741 P.2d 1374, which construed \"maintenance\" such that the issuance of oversize vehicle permits for transport of a mobile home over a winding road on a busy holiday weekend fit within the statutory waiver of immunity under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Rutherford v. Chaves Cnty., 2003-NMSC-010, 133 N.M. 756, 69 P.3d 1199.\n\nSubsection B grants immunity for road design issues.Bierner v. City of Truth or Consequences, 2004-NMCA-093, 136 N.M. 197, 96 P.3d 322.\n\nPresence of condition on one side of road which might spill over to other side of roaddid not create a duty on the part of a state entity to alter the road and areas off the road so that the road becomes a barrier to those conditionsBierner v. City of Truth or Consequences, 2004-NMCA-093, 136 N.M. 197, 96 P.3d 322.\n\nAbsence of guardrail is defect in design, not maintenance.Moore v. State, 1980-NMCA-170, 95 N.M. 300, 621 P.2d 517, cert. deniedsub nom. State v. City of Albuquerque, 95 N.M. 426, 622 P.2d 1046 (1981).\n\nNegligent maintenance of barrier not \"plan\" nor \"design\".— Negligent maintenance of a barrier, consisting of posts and a cable, across a service road is neither a \"plan\" nor \"design\" within the meaning of Subsection B.O'Brien v. Middle Rio Grande Conservancy Dist., 1980-NMCA-075, 94 N.M. 562, 613 P.2d 432.\n\nState liable for negligent fence maintenance.— The state highway department has always had a common law duty to exercise ordinary care to protect the general public from foreseeable harm on the highways of the state. It is for the factfinder to decide whether this duty includes either the erection or maintenance of fences along an urban freeway for the protection of pedestrians; but if the department is found to have breached it's duty by negligently failing to erect or maintain fences along the highway, it may be held liable because such negligence falls within the waiver of sovereign immunity.Lerma ex rel. Lerma v. State Hwy. Dep't, 1994-NMSC-069, 117 N.M. 782, 877 P.2d 1085.\n\nAddition of wheelchair ramps not \"maintenance\".— The waiver of immunity for maintenance of streets and sidewalks does not create duty for city to add wheelchair ramps to sidewalks and intersections; instead, such addition is a reconstruction, immunity for which is expressly restored by Subsection B(2).Villanueva v. City of Tucumcari, 1998-NMCA-138, 125 N.M. 762, 965 P.2d 346.\n\nTraffic controlsconstitute maintenance activities under the Tort Claims Act.Rutherford v. Chaves Cnty., 2003-NMSC-010, 133 N.M. 756, 69 P.3d 1199.\n\nPlacement of signals and signs.— Where the plaintiff's allegations, in large part, concern the placement of signals and signs, the state of New Mexico does not enjoy immunity for such decisions, and whether signs or signals were necessary is a question for the jury.Blackburn v. State, 1982-NMCA-073, 98 N.M. 34, 644 P.2d 548.\n\nThe absence of traffic controls is a condition of a highway and is, therefore, the subject of maintenance, and the state is not immune from liability.Grano v. Roadrunner Trucking, Inc., 1982-NMCA-080, 99 N.M. 227, 656 P.2d 890, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 358, 658 P.2d 433 (1983).\n\nPlacement of signals and signs.— The erection of permanent concrete barriers as part of a road is a matter of road design, not maintenance, and is outside the Tort Claims Act's waiver of immunity.Martinez v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2011-NMCA-082, 150 N.M. 204, 258 P.3d 483, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-008, 268 P.3d 514.\n\nPlacement of concrete barriers was not maintenance.— Where the driver of a vehicle was using the center turn lane to pass a vehicle, lost control, and collided with decedents' vehicle, killing the decedents; and the decedents' estates claimed that the department of transportation negligently failed to maintain the highway because the department failed to perform its duty to erect concrete barriers separating the driving lanes, the lack of permanent barriers in the center turn lane was an attribute of the design of the highway and the department was immune from suit for the alleged failure to install concrete barriers.Martinez v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2011-NMCA-082, 150 N.M. 204, 258 P.3d 483, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-008, 268 P.3d 514.\n\nThe erection of permanent concrete barriersas part of a road is a matter of road design, not maintenance, and is outside the Tort Claims Act's waiver of immunity.Martinez v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2011-NMCA-082, 150 N.M. 204, 258 P.3d 483, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-008, 268 P.3d 513.\n\nPlacement of concrete barriers was not maintenance.— Where the driver of a vehicle was using the center turn lane to pass a vehicle, lost control, and collided with decedents' vehicle, killing the decedents; and the decedents' estates claimed that the department of transportation negligently failed to maintain the highway because the department failed to perform its duty to erect concrete barriers separating the driving lanes, the lack of permanent barriers in the center turn lane was an attribute of the design of the highway and the department was immune from suit for the alleged failure to install concrete barriers.Martinez v. N.M. Dep't of Transp., 2011-NMCA-082, 150 N.M. 204, 258 P.3d 483, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-008, 268 P.3d 513.\n\nIdentification and remediation of roadway hazardsconstitutes highway maintenance under this section.Rutherford v. Chaves Cnty., 2003-NMSC-010, 133 N.M. 756, 69 P.3d 1199.\n\nPlacement of school bus stop deemed \"maintenance\".— The placement of a school bus stop involves elements of traffic control, both pedestrian and vehicular, that are quite similar to the placement of traffic lights or other controls on a road. The placement of such controls, or the lack thereof, constitutes \"maintenance\" of a road under this section.Gallegos v. School Dist. of W. Las Vegas, 1993-NMCA-086, 115 N.M. 779, 858 P.2d 867, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 795, 858 P.2d 1274.\n\nBus stop designation not part of road design.— The state transportation division of the state board of education was not immune from liability under Subsection A in connection with an accident at a school bus stop, since there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that designation of the bus stop by the division was not a part of the design of the road.Gallegos v. State Bd. of Educ., 1997-NMCA-040, 123 N.M. 362, 940 P.2d 468, cert. denied, 123 N.M. 215, 937 P.2d 76.\n\nFailure to enforce procedures not \"maintenance\".— The waiver of immunity contained in this section does not apply to tort claims against the director of the motor vehicles division for failure to implement or enforce procedures, as that is not covered by the definition of \"maintenance.\"Dunn v. State ex rel. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-059, 116 N.M. 1, 859 P.2d 469.\n\nGaps in fence along right-of-way.— The question of whether the department complied with its highway fence design necessarily involves questions of fact such as whether the department secured an agreement from the property owners to construct or maintain fences, or alternatively whether the department made a fact determination that livestock could not enter the highway. If the fact finder determines that the department failed to comply with the design of the highway as governed by 30-8-13 and 30-8-14 NMSA 1978, the lack of agreements or other protective measures would be considered maintenance, and the department would not be entitled to immunity under 41-4-11 NMSA 1978. Because these questions of fact remain to be resolved, summary judgment in favor of the department is precluded.Madrid v. N.M. State Hwy. Dep't, 1994-NMCA-006, 117 N.M. 171, 870 P.2d 133.\n\nLiability of flood control authority for road obstruction.— Placing a steel cable across a service road to prevent public travel on the road is more than the governmental activity of regulating the use of the road through traffic control devices, it is the placing of an obstruction in the service road, a proprietary activity for which Albuquerque metropolitan arroyo flood control authority is liable. A municipality is liable for the negligent failure to keep its streets in a reasonably safe condition.Gallagher v. Albuquerque Metro. Arroyo Flood Control Auth., 1977-NMCA-029, 90 N.M. 309, 563 P.2d 103, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 636, 567 P.2d 485.\n\nTraffic control during flood.— In wrongful death action, where county failed to control traffic on a county road to keep it from entering a crossing when water was high, an objective consistent with the notion of regular highway maintenance, the county was not immune from suit where passengers were washed downstream and drowned during a flood.Rutherford v. Chaves Cnty., 2002-NMCA-059, 132 N.M. 289, 47 P.3d 448,aff'd, 2003-NMSC-010, 133 N.M. 756, 69 P.3d 1199.\n\nNo sovereign immunity for negligent highway maintenance.— Under this section, sovereign immunity does not apply to liability damages caused by negligent maintenance of highways; rather, the highway department has a common-law duty to exercise ordinary care to protect the public from foreseeable harm on the state's highways.Ryan v. N.M. State Hwy. & Transp. Dep't, 1998-NMCA-116, 125 N.M. 588, 964 P.2d 149, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 107, 967 P.2d 447.\n\nWaiver of immunity extends to private service roads.— Waiver of immunity for negligence in the maintenance of a roadway is not limited to a public roadway, but includes a private service road.O'Brien v. Middle Rio Grande Conservancy Dist., 1980-NMCA-075, 94 N.M. 562, 613 P.2d 432.\n\nWaiver of immunity includes negligence in maintenance of highway fences.Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Tucker, 1980-NMCA-082, 95 N.M. 56, 618 P.2d 894.\n\nWaiver of immunity for maintenance of culvert.— This section waives immunity for the negligent maintenance of a culvert by an irrigation district.Tompkins v. Carlsbad Irrigation Dist., 1981-NMCA-072, 96 N.M. 368, 630 P.2d 767.\n\nWaiver not applicable.— Plaintiffs' claim against a state irrigation district for injuries sustained by their son while playing on state property did not fall within the waiver of immunity set forth in this section for the negligent maintenance of a roadway where plaintiffs' complaint did not even allege the existence of a road, much less that the road was owned by the irrigation district or that the road had any causal relationship with the accident.Noriega v. Stahmann Farms, Inc., 1992-NMCA-010, 113 N.M. 441, 827 P.2d 156, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 449, 827 P.2d 837.\n\nNotice of bridge fire not imputed.— Although deputy sheriff had received actual notice of the bridge fire prior to plaintiff's accident, the deputy had no official responsibility to receive or relay notice of the fire to the officials charged with the duty of maintenance of county highways or roads. Thus, actual notice to the deputy sheriff could not have been actual notice to the board of county commissioners of Valencia county.Sanchez v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1970-NMCA-058, 81 N.M. 644, 471 P.2d 678, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 668, 472 P.2d 382.\n\nState fair was not immune from liability under the Tort Claims Actfor injuries sustained by a passenger in an automobile involved in an accident arising from a large number of cars exiting the fairgrounds onto a city street following a rock concert held on state fairground premises leased by concert promoter.Bober v. N.M. State Fair, 1991-NMSC-031, 111 N.M. 644, 808 P.2d 614.\n\nExpert testimony regarding dangerous road condition.— Trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing expert testimony concerning allegedly dangerous road conditions in the case of a single car collision. In such a case, a twofold inquiry is called for: (1) what was the plan or design of the roadway; and (2) did the evidence concern itself solely with that plan or design.Romero v. State, 1991-NMSC-071, 112 N.M. 332, 815 P.2d 628.\n\nMunicipal school system not liable.— Because a municipal school system had no responsibility for maintaining the crosswalk and accompanying signs and signals in front of one of its schools, this section's street maintenance waiver of immunity was inapplicable to it.Johnson v.

      "text": "The immunity granted pursuant to Subsection A of Section 41-4-4 NMSA 1978 does not apply to liability for personal injury, bodily injury, wrongful death or property damage resulting from assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, defamation of character, violation of property rights, the independent tort of negligent spoliation of evidence or the independent tort of intentional spoliation of evidence, failure to comply with duties established pursuant to statute or law or any other deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the United States or New Mexico when caused by law enforcement officers while acting within the scope of their duties. For purposes of this section, \"law enforcement officer\" means a public officer or employee vested by law with the power to maintain order, to make arrests for crime or to detain persons suspected of or convicted of committing a crime, whether that duty extends to all crimes or is limited to specific crimes.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-14-12, enacted by Laws 1976, ch. 58, § 12; 1977, ch. 386, § 9; 2020, ch. 5, § 14; 2020 (1st S.S.), ch. 7, § 3.\n\nThe 2020 (1st S.S.) amendment,effective September 20, 2020, provided that immunity granted pursuant to the Tort Claims Act does not apply to liability for the independent tort of negligent spoliation of evidence or the independent tort of intentional spoliation of evidence; and after \"violation of property rights\", added \"the independent tort of negligent spoliation of evidence or the independent tort of intentional spoliation of evidence\", after \"statute or law or\", added \"any other\", after \"means a public officer\", added \"or employee\", and after \"suspected of\", added \"or convicted of\".\n\nThe 2020 amendment,effective May 20, 2020, waived tort immunity for law enforcement officers who, while acting within the scope of their duties, fail to comply with established duties, and defined \"law enforcement officer\" for purposes of this section; and after \"violation of property rights\", added \"failure to comply with duties established pursuant to statute or law\", and added the last sentence.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nListed torts.— Defendants' immunity for mishandling a gun during an arrest was not waived pursuant to this section, because plaintiff did not allege one of the predicate torts enumerated in the section.Oliveros v. Mitchell, 449 F.3d 1091 (10th Cir. 2006).\n\nStrict construction.— Since the Tort Claims Act is in derogation of a plaintiff's common-law rights to sue governmental employees for negligence, the act is to be strictly construed insofar as it modifies the common law.Methola v. County of Eddy, 1980-NMSC-145, 95 N.M. 329, 622 P.2d 234.\n\nRight to sue and recover under this act is limitedto the rights, procedures, limitations and conditions prescribed in the act.Methola v. County of Eddy, 1980-NMSC-145, 95 N.M. 329, 622 P.2d 234.\n\nImmunity from suit in federal courts.— Although the state has waived its immunity from suit in its own state courts for actions of law enforcement officers, it has not waived its eleventh amendment immunity from suit in federal courts.Flores v. Long, 926 F. Supp. 166 (D.N.M. 1995), appeal dismissed, 110 F.3d 730 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\nRelationship requirement.— A minor daughter of the alleged victim satisfied the close relationship requirement but plaintiffs who asserted that they maintained an intimate relationship with a victim as the equivalent of their \"step-dad\" or \"common law\" husband in their \"family unit\" did not satisfy the close relationship requirement needed to state a claim for bystander recovery.Sollars v. City of Albuquerque, 794 F. Supp. 360 (D.N.M. 1992).\n\nClaim for violating right to familial association.— The plaintiffs, parents of a decedent allegedly killed by the gross negligence and reckless conduct of the defendants, had a claim for violation of constitutional right to familial association.Blea v. City of Espanola, 1994-NMCA-008, 117 N.M. 217, 870 P.2d 755, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 328, 871 P.2d 984.\n\nLiability will not attach until all elements of negligence have been proved,including duty, breach of duty and proximate cause.Schear v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1984-NMSC-079, 101 N.M. 671, 687 P.2d 728.\n\n\"Deprivation of rights\".— Plaintiff's reliance on wrongful death statute and state constitution to argue that violations of those provisions amount to a deprivation of rights secured by the constitution and laws of New Mexico within the meaning of this section was misplaced, because to base a waiver of immunity on those provisions would create exceptions that would eliminate the principle of sovereign immunity, a result not intended by the legislature.Caillouette v. Hercules, Inc., 1992-NMCA-008, 113 N.M. 492, 827 P.2d 1306, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 352, 826 P.2d 573.\n\n\"Caused by\" similar to \"proximate cause\".— The words \"caused by,\" as used in this section, do not differ significantly from the usual meaning of proximate cause found in ordinary negligence cases.Methola v. County of Eddy, 1980-NMSC-145, 95 N.M. 329, 622 P.2d 234.\n\nConcurrent torts of other governmental entities.— This section does not provide a waiver of immunity for concurrent torts of all governmental entities when a police officer causes an occurrence for which immunity of a law enforcement agency is waived.California First Bank v. State, Dep't of Alcohol Beverage Control, 1990-NMSC-106, 111 N.M. 64, 801 P.2d 646.\n\nTort recognized as separate and distinct from constitutional deprivation.— The New Mexico legislature recognizes that a tort is separate and distinct from a constitutional deprivation.Wells v. County of Valencia, 1982-NMSC-048, 98 N.M. 3, 644 P.2d 517.\n\nCollateral estoppel did not apply to preclude plaintiff's state tort claims following federal court dismissal.— Where plaintiff, as the personal representative of decedent's wrongful death estate, brought an action in federal court against the Roosevelt county board of county commissioners, the Roosevelt county sheriff's department, and the Roosevelt county sheriff, alleging deprivations of decedent's rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments through 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as well as causes of action under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (TCA), §§ 41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978, and where the sheriff asserted qualified immunity as a defense to plaintiff's § 1983 claims, and where the federal court granted the sheriff's motion and dismissed all federal claims against all defendants, and where, shortly thereafter, plaintiff filed a complaint in the state district court against the same defendants, alleging claims for negligence and aggravated assault and battery under the TCA, and where defendants moved to dismiss the TCA claims, arguing that because the federal court had already determined that the sheriff acted reasonably, the TCA claims were barred by collateral estoppel because the same standard of \"objective reasonableness\" must apply to plaintiff's TCA claims, the district court erred in applying collateral estoppel to grant defendants' motion to dismiss, because the relevant issues were not actually litigated and necessarily decided in federal court and plaintiff has not had the opportunity to fully and fairly litigate the issues.Hernandez v. Parker, 2022-NMCA-023.\n\nSimilarity to § 1983 action.— Under New Mexico law, the most closely analogous state cause of action for a federal civil rights cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is provided for in this section. The statute of limitations applicable to such a cause of action is set forth in 41-4-15 NMSA 1978.DeVargas v. State ex rel. N.M. Dep't of Corr., 1982-NMSC-025, 97 N.M. 563, 642 P.2d 166.\n\nInstitution of suit invokes applicability of established law of negligence and damages.— In the event a suit is instituted as permitted and limited by this section, the established law of negligence and damages shall apply to the claims as well as to all defenses which may be available to the defendants in those suits.Methola v. County of Eddy, 1980-NMSC-145, 95 N.M. 329, 622 P.2d 234.\n\nVicarious liability of police department.— Absent a claim that the officers were acting outside the scope of their authority, the police department may be held vicariously liable for any alleged torts committed by the officer for which immunity has been waived.Weinstein v. City of Santa Fe ex rel. Santa Fe Police Dep't, 1996-NMSC-021, 121 N.M. 646, 916 P.2d 1313.\n\nTwo-year statute of limitations applies to action for unlawful arrest.— Where plaintiff brought an action against the state of New Mexico, the New Mexico department of public safety, and a state police officer, asserting a cause of action under the New Mexico constitution arising from his allegedly unlawful arrest, and where plaintiff claimed that New Mexico law does not provide a statute of limitations for claims involving an alleged violation of the New Mexico constitution's prohibition of unreasonable seizures and therefore the four-year statute of limitations set forth in § 37-1-4 NMSA 1978 applies, the court held that defendant's allegations fell squarely within § 41-4-12 NMSA 1978, and the statute of limitations applicable to a § 41-4-12 cause of action under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (NMTCA) is the two-year period set forth in § 41-4-15(A) NMSA 1978 of the NMTCA.Rico-Reyes v. New Mexico, 503 F. Supp. 3d 1055 (D. N.M. 2020)\n\nII. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.\n\nProbation and parole officers.— Where the probationer kidnapped the minor victim and repeatedly raped the victim leaving the victim with permanent physical and emotional harm; the probationer was a convicted sex offender with a sixteen-year history of violent crimes; the probationer was under the supervision of the defendant probation and parole officers; the probationer violated the terms of probation numerous times by committing new crimes; in violation of the conditions of probation, the probationer was able to be near plaintiff's home where the probationer had access to the victim and the opportunity to kidnap and rape the victim; plaintiff sued the defendant probation and parole officers alleging that they failed to monitor and supervise the probationer, enforce the conditions of probation, report violations of probation conditions to the court, maintain personal contact with the probationer, and recommended probationer for early discharge; and making arrests for crime, holding persons accused of criminal offense in custody, and maintaining public order did not constitute duties to which probation and parole officers were required to devote a majority of their time, the district court did not err when it ruled that the defendant probation and parole officers were not law enforcement officers under 41-4-3(D) NMSA 1978 and that the waiver of immunity in 41-4-12 NMSA 1978 did not apply to them.Rayos v. State ex rel. Dep't of Corrections, 2014-NMCA-103, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nProbation officers.— Probation officers are not \"law enforcement officers\" under Section 41-4-3D NMSA 1978 and therefore the waiver of immunity for violations of constitutional rights \"caused by law enforcement officers acting within the scope of their duties\" does not apply to them.Bliss v. Franco, 446 F.3d 1036 (10th Cir. 2006)\n\nInvestigator for district attorney.— Where the duties of the chief investigator for the district attorney were to assist attorneys to prepare their cases, assist different agencies with their investigations, help on search warrants, supervise the assignments of a deputy and other investigators and the chief investigator, and accept assignments from attorneys, the office manager, pre-prosecution division, and finance staff, but did not include holding persons in custody, maintaining public order, or making arrests, the chief investigator was not a law enforcement officer.Fernandez v. Mora-San Miguel Elec. Co-op., Inc., 462 F. 3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2006).\n\n\"Law enforcement officers\".— The director and the captain and assistant director of a county detention center were subject to suit as law enforcement officers under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Davis v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1999-NMCA-110, 127 N.M. 785, 987 P.2d 1172.\n\nParole officers and their supervisors were not law enforcement officers under 41-4-3 D NMSA 1978 and therefore the waiver of immunity in this section did not apply to them.Vigil v. Martinez, 1992-NMCA-033, 113 N.M. 714, 832 P.2d 405.\n\nEddy county sheriff, his deputies and jailers employed by the city of Albuquerque who performed services in or held in custody plaintiffs incarcerated in the Bernalillo and Eddy county jails are \"law enforcement officers,\" bringing them within the purview of this section.Methola v. County of Eddy, 1980-NMSC-145, 95 N.M. 329, 622 P.2d 234.\n\nThe office of the medical investigator and a physician employed as a medical investigator by that office are not law enforcement officers.Dunn v. McFeeley, 1999-NMCA-084, 127 N.M. 513, 984 P.2d 760, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 389, 981 P.2d 1207.\n\nA crime laboratory technician and his employer, the state police crime laboratory, whose duties are to examine and evaluate physical evidence that may relate to a possible offense, are not law enforcement officers.Dunn v. McFeeley, 1999-NMCA-084, 127 N.M. 513, 984 P.2d 760, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 389, 981 P.2d 1207.\n\nA mayor is not a law enforcement officer for purposes of this act.Montes v. Gallegos, 812 F. Supp. 1165 (D.N.M. 1992).\n\nThe director of the motor vehicle division, whose duties involved principally administrative matters, and who did not serve as a full-time law enforcement officer whose principal duties involved holding in custody persons accused of criminal offenses, maintaining public order or making arrests for crimes, was not a \"law enforcement officer\" within the contemplation of this section.Dunn v. State ex rel. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-059, 116 N.M. 1, 859 P.2d 469.\n\nDistrict attorneys and their staffs do not fall within the \"law enforcement officer\" exception from immunity under the Tort Claims Act.Coyazo v. State, 1995-NMCA-056, 120 N.M. 47, 897 P.2d 234.\n\nThe statutory requirement that the defendants be law enforcement officers does not focus on the defendants' specific acts at the time of their alleged negligence; instead, it simply requires that the defendants' principal duties, those duties to which they devote a majority of their time, be of a law enforcement nature. The requirement in 41-4-12 NMSA 1978 that the officer must be acting within the scope of his duties simply means that the officer must be acting within the scope of employment in order to be sued in his or her capacity as a law enforcement officer.Weinstein v. City of Santa Fe ex rel. Santa Fe Police Dep't, 1996-NMSC-021, 121 N.M. 646, 916 P.2d 1313.\n\nThe officers in this case are municipal police officers subject to 3-13-2 NMSA 1978, and their principal duties entail making arrests for crimes and maintaining public order; accordingly, they are law enforcement officers for purposes of the Tort Claims Act. Weinstein v. City of Santa Fe ex rel.Santa Fe Police Dep't, 1996-NMSC-021, 121 N.M. 646, 916 P.2d 1313.\n\nAdoption agency investigators.— Employees of a state adoption agency who investigated the death of an adopted child were not law enforcement officers because they did not perform the traditional duties of law enforcement officers of holding persons in custody, maintaining public order, and making arrests.Johnson ex rel. Estate of Cano v. Holmes, 377 F. Supp. 2d 1069 (D.N.M. 2004),aff'd, 455 F.3d 1133 (10th Cir. 2006).\n\nAnimal control officer.— An animal control officer of a municipality is not a law enforcement officer, because the officer's duties did not include the maintenance of public order.Tate v. Fish, 347 F. Supp. 2d 1049 (D.N.M. 2004).\n\nGrant of summary judgment improper where defendant failed to meet his burden of showing that transit security officers were not law enforcement officers for purposes of the Tort Claims Act.— Where plaintiff brought a tort claim against the city of Albuquerque and two transit security officers (TSO), alleging excessive force, unlawful seizure, assault, battery, and false arrest/false imprisonment, and where the district court dismissed plaintiff's tort claims after concluding that the TSOs were not law enforcement officers under the provisions of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act and were therefore immune from plaintiff's tort claims, the district court erred in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment, because the description of a TSO's essential functions included providing security services, conducting periodic patrols, regulating the flow of city employees and the public to ensure safety, providing crowd and traffic control as needed, responding to calls for service and reports of crimes in progress, calling for emergency medical or police services as needed, assisting law enforcement agencies as needed, conducting preliminary investigations to determine if a crime had been committed, documenting incidents and preparing reports, providing general assistance to the public, and preparing a variety of reports regarding security enforcement activities, and therefore, aside from the absence of a gun and the authority to arrest, a TSO's job was nearly identical to the normal commonplace activities of a police officer on patrol. Defendants failed to carry their burden of showing the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact, and therefore summary judgment was improper.Hernandez v. Fitzgerald, 840 F. App'x 333 (10th Cir. 2020).\n\nSummary judgment was proper where plaintiff failed to identify a negligent public employee who was a law enforcement officer.— In a wrongful death lawsuit, where plaintiff, as personal representative of the estate of decedent, brought claims against the New Mexico Corrections Department (NMCD) after decedent was killed by an inmate who had been erroneously released from custody, alleging negligent operation of the NMCD facility from which the inmate had been released, and negligent actions by law enforcement officers, and where defendants moved for summary judgment arguing that they were immune from suit under the Tort Claims Act, 41-4-1 to 41-4-30 NMSA 1878, and where the district granted defendant's motion on the negligent law enforcement claim on the grounds that plaintiff had not shown that a negligent NMCD employee was a \"law enforcement officer\" as required to establish waiver, summary judgment was properly granted on this ground, because plaintiff failed to identify a negligent public employee who was a law enforcement officer.Sanders v. NMDOC, 2023-NMCA-030, cert. denied.\n\nEffect of exceeding official duties.— When an officer exceeds official duties and makes an arrest without authority of the municipality or in execution of orders thereof, the officer ceases to act on behalf of the city and assumes the entire responsibility personally.Stull v. City of Tucumcari, 1975-NMCA-105, 88 N.M. 320, 540 P.2d 250, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 319, 540 P.2d 249.\n\nNo distinction shall be drawn with regard to \"public\" or \"special\" dutyof governmental employees whose immunity to suit for acts of negligence has been excepted under this article.Schear v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1984-NMSC-079, 101 N.M. 671, 687 P.2d 728.\n\nSecretary of corrections is not a law enforcement officerwithin the meaning of this section as defined in 41-4-3D NMSA 1978.Silva v. State, 1987-NMSC-107, 106 N.M. 472, 745 P.2d 380.\n\nIII. SCOPE OF DUTIES.\n\nDuty to enforce speed limits.— Where decedent was killed when decedent's vehicle was struck by a speeding van driver by a corrections officer; the sheriff's department received numerous complaints about the dangerous traffic condition on the road where the accident occurred involving its own officers, corrections officers and others; and despite that knowledge, the sheriff's department did not enforce the traffic laws as required by state or investigate the complaints, the wrongful death claim falls within the waiver of immunity for law enforcement officers.Wachocki v. Bernalillo Cnty. Sheriff's Dep't, 2010-NMCA-021, 147 N.M. 720, 228 P.3d 504,aff'd, 2011-NMSC-039, 150 N.M. 650, 265 P.3d 701.\n\nDuty of law enforcement officer.— A law enforcement officer has the duty in any activity actually undertaken to exercise for the safety of others that care ordinarily exercised by a reasonably prudent and qualified officer in light of the nature of what is being done.Cross v. City of Clovis, 1988-NMSC-045, 107 N.M. 251, 755 P.2d 589.\n\nAlthough a law enforcement officer or agency may be held liable under this section for negligently causing infliction of one of the predicate torts, simple negligence in the performance of a law enforcement officer's duty does not amount to commission of one of the torts listed in the section.Bober v. N.M. State Fair, 1991-NMSC-031, 111 N.M. 644, 808 P.2d 614.\n\nSummary judgment in favor of state police was affirmed in the case of an automobile passenger's action for injuries sustained in a traffic accident following a rock concert, in the absence of any allegations giving rise to a duty on the part of the state police to exercise ordinary care for the passenger's safety.Bober v. N.M. State Fair, 1991-NMSC-031, 111 N.M. 644, 808 P.2d 614.\n\nAs a matter of law, the plaintiffs, children of the deceased killed by law enforcement officers, were unforeseeable as injured parties and, therefore, the defendant officers owed no duty to them.Lucero v. Salazar, 1994-NMCA-066, 117 N.M. 803, 877 P.2d 1106, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 802, 877 P.2d 1105.\n\nAn employee's action, although unauthorized, is considered to be in the scope of employment if the action (1) is the kind the employee is employed to perform; (2) occurs during a period reasonably connected to the authorized employment period; (3) occurs in an area reasonably close to the authorized area, and (4) is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer. Accordingly, since the police officer conducted an arrest too far removed from the place he was authorized to perform his duties, and the arrest occurred during a time that he was expressly told to take off, the officer did not act within scope of his duties.Narney v. Daniels, 1992-NMCA-133, 115 N.M. 41, 846 P.2d 347, cert. denied, 114 N.M. 720, 845 P.2d 814 (1993).\n\nCorrectional officer, acting within the scope of his duties, was immune from liability.— Where plaintiff, a former inmate at western New Mexico correctional facility (WNMCF), a prison run by the New Mexico corrections department, filed a complaint for damages against defendant, a former corrections officer at WNMCF who repeatedly subjected plaintiff to sexual abuse, alleging that as a result of the abuse, defendant was liable for sexual assault and false imprisonment under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (NMTCA), defendant was protected by the NMTCA's immunity to liability for intentional torts, because although defendant's abuse was unauthorized and irrelevant to his employment, defendant was within his scope of duties when abusing plaintiff as the abuse took place at WNMCF during defendant's time of employment and defendant was on duty as a corrections officer while the abuse took place. Limiting \"scope of duties\" to only those acts officially requested, required or authorized would render all unlawful acts, which are always unauthorized, beyond the remedial scope of the NMTCA.Garcia v. Martinez, 414 F. Supp. 3d 1348 (D. N.M. 2019).\n\nIV. WAIVER OF IMMUNITY.\n\nImmunity not waived.— Where the decedent was experiencing the effect of withdrawal from heroin when the metropolitan court ordered his release; the decedent was initially released to be transported by van as required by jail policy, but he exited the van; the decedent re-entered the metropolitan jail; the decedent was released to the jail parking lot without signing a waiver of van transportation contrary to jail policy; the decedent wandered off into the desert and died of hypothermia; and the medical director of the jail opined that at the time of his release, the decedent had no medical condition that required treatment, the city was not liable under the Tort Claims Act on plaintiff's claim that the jail officers who knew or should have known that the manner of the decedent's release would endanger his life.Lessen v. City of Albuquerque, 2008-NMCA-085, 144 N.M. 314, 187 P.3d 179, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-005, 144 N.M. 331, 187 P.3d 677.\n\nImmunity not waived for mere negligence.— There is no waiver of immunity under this section for mere negligence of law enforcement officers that does not result in one of the enumerated acts.Blea v. City of Espanola, 1994-NMCA-008, 117 N.M. 217, 870 P.2d 755, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 328, 871 P.2d 984.\n\nImmunity not waived for deprivation of \"happiness\".— Vague references to \"safety\" or \"happiness\" in N.M. Const., art. II, § 4 are not sufficient to state a claim under this section. Waiver of immunity based on such constitutional grounds would emasculate the immunity preserved in the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Blea v. City of Espanola, 1994-NMCA-008, 117 N.M. 217, 870 P.2d 755, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 328, 871 P.2d 984.\n\nImmunity waived under 41-4-5 NMSA 1978.— Section 41-4-5 NMSA 1978, which waives immunity for negligent operation or maintenance of a motor vehicle, watercraft, or aircraft, applies to all public employees, including law enforcement officers. This section, which applies only to law enforcement officers, waives immunity only for the acts enumerated in this provision, such as assault and battery.Wilson v. Grant Cnty., 1994-NMCA-001, 117 N.M. 105, 869 P.2d 293.\n\nHarm result of accident.— In plaintiff's wrongful death suit against the state and a law enforcement officer, no waiver of immunity existed where the harm allegedly caused by the officer was clearly the result of an accident rather than an intentional tort, and the officer's decisions did not support an inference of an intention to engage in unlawful conduct that invaded the protected interests of others.Caillouette v. Hercules, Inc., 1992-NMCA-008, 113 N.M. 492, 827 P.2d 1306, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 352, 826 P.2d 573.\n\nV. CLAIMS COVERED.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nClaim for negligent misrepresentation.— Plaintiff's allegations against officers of a county detention center based on their negligent misrepresentations in making an employment recommendation about a former employee state a viable claim for relief against the county.Davis v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1999-NMCA-110, 127 N.M. 785, 987 P.2d 1172.\n\nWrongful execution of writ.— The facial validity of a writ of restitution protects the executing officers from liability. Runge v. Fox, 1990-NMCA-086, 110 N.M. 447, 796 P.2d 1143.\n\nLiability for violent assault.— Where deputy town marshal, acting upon order of mayor, committed violent assault upon plaintiff using more force than circumstances warranted, the town was not liable in damages since mayor exceeded authority and ceased to act in behalf of the town.Salazar v. Town of Bernalillo, 1956-NMSC-125, 62 N.M. 199, 307 P.2d 186.\n\nSexual harassment and invasion of privacy.— Because sexual harassment and invasion of privacy are not among the enumerated torts for which immunity is waived, the prisoner's claims fail.Ramer v. Place-Gallegos, 1994-NMCA-101, 118 N.M. 363, 881 P.2d 723.\n\nEmotional distress.— The Tort Claims Act does not waive the immunity of law enforcement officers for intentional infliction of emotional distress standing alone as a common-law tort. Damages for emotional distress, however, may be recoverable as damages for \"personal injury\" resulting from one of the enumerated acts.Romero v. Otero, 678 F. Supp. 1535 (D.N.M. 1987).\n\nClaim for loss of consortium is permissible under the Tort Claims Act.—Where plaintiffs' father was shot and killed by law enforcement officers during a stolen vehicle investigation, the district court erred in dismissing plaintiffs' complaint on the ground that their loss of consortium claims did not fall within the Tort Claims Act (TCA), because the TCA waives a law enforcement officer's sovereign immunity from liability for personal injury and for bodily injury damages resulting from battery, and loss of consortium damages may be characterized as either personal or bodily injury damages, and therefore both the injury and the tort from which the plaintiff's claim for loss of consortium damages derive are specifically enumerated under this section.Thompson v. City of Albuquerque, 2017-NMSC-021,aff'g2017-NMCA-002, 386 P.3d 1015.\n\nClaims for loss of consortium damages are independent of the underlying tort claim.— Where plaintiffs' father was shot and killed by law enforcement officers during a stolen vehicle investigation, the plaintiffs were not required to bring their claim for loss of consortium damages along with the underlying battery claim, because loss of consortium claimants suffer a direct injury separate from the physical injury to another.Thompson v. City of Albuquerque, 2017-NMSC-021,aff'g2017-NMCA-002, 386 P.3d 1015.\n\nDamages for loss of consortium may be recovered.— Where plaintiffs' father was shot and killed by law enforcement officers during a stolen vehicle investigation, the district court erred in dismissing plaintiffs' complaint on the ground that their loss of consortium claims did not fall within the Tort Claims Act (TCA), because generally, plaintiffs should be allowed to recover for loss of consortium if the evidence shows that their relationships with the decedent were sufficiently close financially, socially, or both, and if it was foreseeable that the injury to the decedent would harm the relationships, and loss of consortium can be asserted against New Mexico government actors, despite that it is not specifically mentioned in the TCA, provided that the underlying tort, the one that caused direct physical injury, itself triggers an immunity waiver under the TCA.Thompson v. City of Albuquerque, 2017-NMCA-002, cert. granted.\n\nNegligent release of criminal suspect.— Plaintiff's complaint, claiming personal injuries and damages resulting from rape by a criminal suspect following the suspect's allegedly negligent release from a detention center, stated a cause of action against the city which operated the center and against the center director.Abalos v. Bernalillo Cnty. Dist. Attorney's Office, 1987-NMCA-026, 105 N.M. 554, 734 P.2d 794, cert. quashed, 106 N.M. 35, 738 P.2d 907.\n\nThe plaintiff's allegations that the officers were negligent in failing to forward the paperwork necessary to prosecute the man who later raped her and in failing to develop a policy to prevent the release of such prisoners back into the community at large met the requirement of alleging that the officers failed to exercise the care of reasonably prudent and qualified officers in an activity undertaken for the safety of others, and the allegations are therefore sufficient to state a claim under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Weinstein v. City of Santa Fe ex rel. Santa Fe Police Dep't, 1996-NMSC-021, 121 N.M. 646, 916 P.2d 1313.\n\nNegligent failure to apprehend drunk driver.— Allegations in a complaint that sheriff deputies failed to apprehend a drunk driver or investigate a tavern disturbance and that this failure proximately caused personal injury to the plaintiff's family, sufficed to state a cause of action for negligent violation of a right secured under New Mexico law for which this section waives sovereign immunity.California First Bank v. State, Dep't of Alcohol Beverage Control, 1990-NMSC-106, 111 N.M. 64, 801 P.2d 646.\n\nLiability for failure to detain intoxicated driver.— Law enforcement officers may be liable if they fail to detain an intoxicated driver who then acts with the requisite level of intent to commit a battery while driving intoxicated.Blea v. City of Espanola, 1994-NMCA-008, 117 N.M. 217, 870 P.2d 755, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 328, 871 P.2d 984.\n\nOfficer's unlawful entry.— Chief of police's deliberate and unlawful intrusion into a person's home to effect the arrest of a spouse constituted a trespass actionable under this section.Montes v. Gallegos, 812 F. Supp. 1165 (D.N.M. 1992).\n\nNegligence of city police officers in maintaining a police roadblockwas a question for the jury, and the jury reasonably could have found that the officers' failure to keep a proper lookout and failure to warn proximately caused the death of one in the zone of the danger in question.Cross v. City of Clovis, 1988-NMSC-045,107 N.M. 251, 755 P.2d 589.\n\nB. DUTY TO INVESTIGATE.\n\nClass of persons to be protected by duty to investigate.— In creating the duty to investigate, the legislature did not limit the traditional tort concept of foreseeability that would otherwise define the intended beneficiaries of the statute; all persons who are foreseeably at risk within the general population are within the class of persons to be protected by the duty to investigate.Torres v. State, 1995-NMSC-025, 119 N.M. 609, 894 P.2d 386.\n\nWhen any person of the public, regardless of geographic location, is foreseeably at risk of injury by a party reported to be in violation of the criminal law, officers undertaking the investigation of the crime owe that person a duty to exercise the care ordinarily exercised by prudent and qualified officers.Torres v. State, 1995-NMSC-025, 119 N.M. 609, 894 P.2d 386.\n\nForeseeability of criminal act.— Since it is not unlikely that a murderer would flee the city in which the crime was committed and, given modern-day transportation, that this person would flee across state lines, and since the police knew or should have known that it is possible that a person who kills randomly with no motive would kill again, the harm in this case was not so removed from the conduct of the defendants that the court may say as a matter of law that the victims were unforeseeable; thus foreseeability is a question for the jury to determine by giving thought to, among other things, the time, space, and distance between the alleged failure to investigate and the deaths of the two victims.Torres v. State, 1995-NMSC-025, 119 N.M. 609, 894 P.2d 386.\n\nLiability for inadequate response to reported criminal act.— A governmental entity and its law enforcement officers may be held liable for negligently failing, after receiving notice, to take adequate action to protect a citizen from imminent danger and injury and for failing to adopt proper procedures for responding to, and investigating, reported criminal acts.Schear v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1984-NMSC-079, 101 N.M. 671, 687 P.2d 728.\n\nLiability for failure to bring criminals before court.— The statutory obligations that officers cooperate with prosecutors and bring defendants before the courts are primarily designed to protect the public by ensuring that dangerous criminals are removed from society and brought to justice; accordingly, as with the duty to investigate crimes under 29-1-1 NMSA 1978, the duties of cooperating with prosecutors, diligently filing complaints, and bringing defendants before the courts inure to the benefit of private individuals, and the violation of these statutory duties may give rise to a cognizable claim under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Weinstein v. City of Santa Fe ex rel. Santa Fe Police Dep't, 1996-NMSC-021, 121 N.M. 646, 916 P.2d 1313.\n\nC. TRAINING AND SUPERVISION.\n\nNegligent training and supervision by superiors.— When personal injury results from a violation by subordinate officers of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the United States or New Mexico or from commission of certain torts specified in this section, then the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] waives immunity for negligent supervision or training by superior law enforcement officers that proximately causes the violation. However, that immunity is not waived for negligent training and supervision standing alone; such negligence must cause a tort specified in this section or violation of rights.McDermitt v. Corrections Corp. of Am., 1991-NMCA-034, 112 N.M. 247, 814 P.2d 115 (Ct. App. 1991).\n\nThe Tort Claims Act does not provide immunity to law enforcement officers whose negligent supervision and training of their subordinates proximately causes the commission by those subordinates of the torts of assault, battery, false arrest, and malicious prosecution.Ortiz v. N.M. State Police, 1991-NMCA-031, 112 N.M. 249, 814 P.2d 117, cert. quashed, 113 N.M. 352, 826 P.2d 573 (1992).\n\nSheriff, who was a defendant in a case involving a fatal shooting by a deputy, was not immune from liability for negligently failing to train or supervise his employees.Quezada v. Cnty. of Bernalillo, 944 F.2d 710 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Constitutional Torts and the New Mexico Torts Claims Act,\" see 13 N.M.L.

Actions against a governmental entity or a public employee for torts shall be forever barred, unless such action is commenced within two years after the date of occurrence resulting in loss, injury or death, except that a minor under the full age of seven years shall have until his ninth birthday in which to file. This subsection applies to all persons regardless of minority or other legal disability.\n\nB. The provisions of Subsection A of this section shall not apply to any occurrence giving rise to a claim which occurred before July 1, 1976.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-14-14, enacted by Laws 1976, ch. 58, § 14; 1977, ch. 386, § 11.\n\nEmergency clauses.— Laws 1977, ch. 386, § 23 contained an emergency clause and was approved April 8, 1977.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nFraudulent concealment.— The doctrine of fraudulent concealment applies to toll 41-4-15 NMSA 1978.Armijo v. Regents of Univ. of N.M., 1984-NMCA-118, 103 N.M. 183, 704 P.2d 437,rev'd in part on other grounds, 1985-NMSC-057, 103 N.M. 174, 704 P.2d 428.\n\nConstitutionality.— The failure of this section to provide a tolling provision for persons under a legal disability with claims against governmental entities does not violate the right of a mentally handicapped plaintiff to equal protection of the laws.Jaramillo v. State Hwy. Dep't, 1991-NMCA-008, 111 N.M. 722, 809 P.2d 636, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 416, 806 P.2d 65.\n\nThe two-year time period of limitations under this section is a reasonable period of time and does not violate a plaintiff's rights to due process.Jaramillo v. State Hwy. Dep't, 1991-NMCA-008, 111 N.M. 722, 809 P.2d 636, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 416, 806 P.2d 65.\n\nThe language of Subsection A of this section and 41-5-13 NMSA 1978are both very different than the language of 37-1-8 NMSA 1978.Maestas v.

Zager, 2005-NMCA-013, 136 N.M. 764, 105 P.3d 317, cert. granted, 2005-NMCERT-001, 137 N.M. 18, 106 P.3d 579,rev'd, 2007-NMSC-003, 141 N.M. 154, 152 P.3d 141.\n\nOnce loss occurs, limitation period begins.— Until an occurrence resulting in loss takes place, the statute of limitations cannot begin to run.Aragon & McCoy v. Albuquerque Nat'l Bank, 1983-NMSC-020, 99 N.M. 420, 659 P.2d 306.\n\nTime for giving notice in medical malpractice actionis calculated from the time the injury manifests itself in a physically objective manner and is ascertainable.Tafoya v.

Dep't of Corrs., 1982-NMSC-025, 97 N.M. 563, 642 P.2d 166.\n\nRelation back of amendments.— An action for malpractice and wrongful death brought under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] by the natural parents of a deceased child within the limitation period was not barred because the parents failed to secure court appointment as personal representatives within the two-year limitation period of this section, due to the operation of Rules 15(c) (relation back of amendments) and 17(a) (real party in interest), N.M.R.C.P., (nowseeParagraph C of Rule 1-015 NMRA and Paragraph A of Rule 1-017 NMRA).Chavez v. Regents of Univ. of N.M., 1985-NMSC-114, 103 N.M. 606, 711 P.2d 883.\n\nGeneral savings provision inapplicable.— The general savings provision of 37-1-14 NMSA 1978, which protects from limitations a new suit filed within six months after dismissal of a prior suit, does not apply to an action under this article.Estate of Gutierrez v. Albuquerque Police Dep't, 1986-NMCA-023, 104 N.M. 111, 717 P.2d 87, cert. denied sub nom., 103 N.M. 798, 715 P.2d 71,overruled on other grounds byBracken v. Yates Petroleum Corp., 1988-NMSC-072, 107 N.M. 463, 760 P.2d 155.\n\nNo equitable tolling while federal jurisdiction asserted.— Principles of equitable tolling did not apply to an action under this article during the time the claim was being asserted on the basis of pendent jurisdiction in a federal court.Estate of Gutierrez v. Albuquerque Police Dep't, 1986-NMCA-023, 104 N.M. 111, 717 P.2d 87, cert. denied sub nom., 103 N.M. 798, 715 P.2d 71,overruled on other grounds byBracken v. Yates Petroleum Corp., 1988-NMSC-072, 107 N.M. 463, 760 P.2d 155.\n\nWhen last day of limitation period falls on Saturday.— Rule 1-006A NMRA, which provides that if the last day of a statutory time period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period runs until the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, supersedes former 12-2-2G NMSA 1978 (now 12-2A-7 NMSA 1978), which only extends the time period to the following Monday if the last day falls on a Sunday. Therefore, a claim under the Torts Claim Act was not barred by the two-year statute of limitations of this section when the last day of the two-year period fell on a Saturday and the plaintiff filed a claim on the following Monday.Dutton v. McKinley Cnty. Bd. of Comm'rs, 1991-NMCA-130, 113 N.M. 51, 822 P.2d 1134.\n\nApplication of Arizona statute.— New Mexico, as the forum state, is not required to recognize Arizona's statute of limitations attaching or the sovereign immunity granted to its public employees. Therefore, the one-year limitations period applicable to Arizona public employees is not applicable to actions involving these employees when the cause of action accrues in New Mexico.Sam v. Estate of Sam, 2004-NMCA-018, 135 N.M. 101, 84 P.3d 1066,rev'd, 2006-NMSC-022, 139 N.M. 474, 134 P.3d 761.\n\nII. APPLICABILITY.\n\nTort Claims Act statute of limitations.— Where child was eight years old when she was assaulted and statute of limitations required that she file suit by age ten, it was unreasonable as a matter of law to expect the child to comply with the requirements of the statute limitations at such a young age and the application of the statute to the child violated her right to due process of law.Campos v. Davis, 2006-NMSC-020, 139 N.M. 474, 134 P.3d 761.\n\nTwo-year statute of limitations applies to action for unlawful arrest.— Where plaintiff brought an action against the state of New Mexico, the New Mexico department of public safety, and a state police officer, asserting a cause of action under the New Mexico constitution arising from his allegedly unlawful arrest, and where plaintiff claimed that New Mexico law does not provide a statute of limitations for claims involving an alleged violation of the New Mexico constitution's prohibition of unreasonable seizures and therefore the four-year statute of limitations set forth in § 37-1-4 NMSA 1978 applies, the court held that defendant's allegations fell squarely within § 41-4-12 NMSA 1978, and the statute of limitations applicable to a § 41-4-12 cause of action under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (NMTCA) is the two-year period set forth in § 41-4-15(A) NMSA 1978 of the NMTCA.Rico-Reyes v. New Mexico, 503 F. Supp. 3d 1055 (D. N.M. 2020)\n\nSection inapplicable to federal civil rights action.— An action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for excessive use of force during an arrest is not governed by the limitations on actions contained in this section but by the general statutory limitations on actions for personal injury, 37-1-8 NMSA 1978, or for miscellaneous claims, 37-1-4 NMSA 1978.Gunther v. Miller, 498 F. Supp. 882 (D.N.M. 1980).\n\nUnder New Mexico law, the most closely analogous state cause of action for a federal civil rights cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is provided for under 41-4-12 NMSA 1978. The statute of limitations applicable to such a cause of action is set forth in this section.DeVargas v. State ex rel. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 1982-NMSC-025, 97 N.M. 563, 642 P.2d 166.\n\nSince claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 are in essence actions to recover for injury to personal rights, 37-1-8 NMSA 1978, not this section, provides the appropriate limitations period.Garcia v. Wilson, 731 F.2d 640 (10th Cir. 1984),aff'd, 471 U.S. 261, 105 S. Ct. 1938, 85 L. Ed. 2d 254 (1985).\n\nFor New Mexico, the United States Supreme Court has identified 37-1-8 NMSA 1978, governing the right to recover for injury to personal rights, as the relevant limitations statute in civil rights cases under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as a matter of federal law. The court specifically rejected this section's statute of limitations applicable for wrongs committed by public officials.Walker v. Maruffi, 1987-NMCA-048, 105 N.M. 763, 737 P.2d 544, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 707, 736 P.2d 985.\n\nPublic capacity determined by facts.— District court correctly applied the law when it estopped the doctor from asserting the statute of limitations defense under this section because by choosing to place the doctor at a private institution, and not identify him as a public employee working in a public capacity, the state engaged in conduct that conveyed the indisputable impression to persons wishing to assert a claim that the doctor was an employee of the private institution; as such, the claim was timely filed within the statute of limitations for actions against private entities, 41-5-13 NMSA 1978.Hagen v. Faherty, 2003-NMCA-060, 133 N.M. 605, 66 P.3d 974, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 593, 66 P.3d 962.\n\nAct limited to New Mexico public employees.— The Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] specifies that only public employees employed by New Mexico governmental entities, not simply any governmental entity, are covered by the act.Sam v. Estate of Sam, 2004-NMCA-018, 135 N.M. 101, 84 P.3d 1066,rev'd, 2006-NMSC-022, 139 N.M. 474, 134 P.3d 761.\n\nSummary judgment for defendant was improper where defendant failed to show that nonprofit corporation was so intertwined with a governmental entity for the Tort Claims Act to apply.— Where plaintiff, the personal representative of decedent, filed a complaint alleging medical malpractice and other claims arising from medical treatment received by decedent, and where defendant, the surgeon that performed the surgery on decedent, filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that he was a public employee and therefore the two-year statute of limitations barred claims that were filed more than two years after decedent's last visit with defendant, the district court erred in finding that defendant's employer, a nonprofit corporation, fell under the ambit of the Tort Claims Act and that the complaint was untimely, because in his motion, defendant did not make any showing that his employer, a nonprofit corporation, was so intertwined with a governmental entity for the Tort Claims Act to apply. The district court therefore erred by holding plaintiff's claims were time barred by the Tort Claims Act's two-year statute of limitations.Murphy v. Lash, 2024-NMCA-031, cert. granted.\n\nApplication of section to action by subrogated insurance company.— Because a subrogated insurance company is considered to be standing in the shoes of the insured, the two-year statute of limitations in a subrogated action governed by this section begins to run when the insured's cause of action arises.Health Plus v. Harrell, 1998-NMCA-064, 125 N.M. 189, 958 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 145, 958 P.2d 103.\n\nTwo-year statute of limitations applicable to negligence suit involving public utility's employee.— This section, allowing two years to bring suit, and not the one-year limitation of 37-1-24 NMSA 1978, which refers to the time for bringing suits in negligence against any city, town or village, or any officers thereof, applies to a suit for negligence of a public employee in the operation of a public utility.Cozart v. Town of Bernalillo, 1983-NMCA-053, 99 N.M. 737, 663 P.2d 713.\n\nDeadline does not apply to child incapable of meeting it.— As a matter of due process, a child who is incapable of meeting the deadline in this section cannot have that deadline applied to bar the child's right to legal relief; therefore, dismissal of claim filed shortly after child's ninth birthday is reversed.Jaramillo v. Board. of Regents, 2001-NMCA-024, 130 N.M. 256, 23 P.3d 931.\n\nMinority exception under Subsection A applies only to living minors.Regents of Univ. of N.M. v. Armijo, 1985-NMSC-057, 103 N.M. 174, 704 P.2d 428.\n\nTort Claims Act statute of limitations applies to states sued in New Mexico courts.— In the interests of comity, New Mexico will extend the tort claims statute of limitations to states with similar tort claims acts when they are sued in New Mexico district courts.Sam v. Estate of Sam, 2006-NMSC-022, 139 N.M. 474, 134 P.3d 761.\n\nThe doctrine of fraudulent concealment tolls the statute of limitations.— Where plaintiffs, developmentally disabled patients who were involuntarily committed to state-run institutions, brought an action against the state department of health (DOH), individual DOH officials, and state institutions operated by the DOH, asserting claims pursuant to the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (act), and where DOH defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs' claims because the act contains a two-year statute of limitations on claims and the act explicitly provides that the limitations period is not subject to tolling, and where plaintiffs', although their claims fell outside the two-year limitations period in the act, asked the court to toll the statute of limitations pursuant to the doctrines of legal disability or fraudulent concealment, the court held that New Mexico law does not provide for tolling on the basis of mental capacity, but that the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, whether active or passive, can toll the running of the statute of limitations, and plaintiffs established the existence of a confidential or fiduciary special relationship that gives rise to a duty to disclose and that defendants breached that duty.JL v. New Mexico Department of Health, 165 F.Supp.3d 1048 (D.N.M. 2016).\n\nIII. ACCRUAL OF ACTION.\n\nAccrual of action.— Section 41-4-15A NMSA 1978 is a discovery-based statute of limitations that accrues when a plaintiff knows or with reasonable diligence should have known of the injury and its cause.Maestas v. Zager, 2007-NMSC-003, 141 N.M. 154, 152 P.3d 141.\n\nAbuse of process.— A malicious-abuse-of-process claim accrues immediately upon the improper use of process. Plaintiff's malicious-abuse-of-process claim accrued when police sergeant defendant filed an amended criminal complaint. Pursuant to the 41-4-15A NMSA 1978, plaintiff had two years from that point to file his state tort claims.Mata v. Anderson, 685 F.Supp.2d 1223 (D.N.M. 2010),aff'd, 635 F.3d 1250 (10th Cir. 2011).\n\nFalse arrest and false imprisonment.— The statute of limitations for claims of false arrest and false imprisonment begins to run, under New Mexico law, when the imprisonment ends. Where plaintiff filed her complaint within two years of the end of her imprisonment, her NMTCA claims are timely.Gose v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs of the Cnty. of McKinley, 727 F.Supp.2d 1256 (D.N.M. 2010).\n\nThe temporal focus of Subsection A of this sectionseems to be on the date of the occurrence rather than the loss, injury, or death.Maestas v. Zager, 2005-NMCA-013, 136 N.M. 764, 105 P.3d 317, cert. granted, 2005-NMCERT-001,rev'd, 2007-NMSC-003, 141 N.M. 154, 152 P.3d 141.\n\nThe limitation period commences when an injury manifests itself and is ascertainable,rather than when the wrongful or negligent act occurs.Long v. Weaver, 1986-NMCA-108, 105 N.M. 188, 730 P.2d 491.\n\nWhere, in 1998, the municipality constructed a flood retention pond next to plaintiff's building; in 2004, plaintiff's tenant informed plaintiff that the northeast side of the foundation of the building was substantially cracking, that the ground around the around it was saturated with water, and that the tenant believed that the retention pond caused the damage; and plaintiff filed suit against the municipality for damages in 2008, plaintiff's claims against the municipality were time barred because the tenant's information was sufficient to notify plaintiff, more than three years before plaintiff filed suit, of both serious structural damage requiring further investigation and a causal link between the retention pond and the injury to plaintiff's property.Yurcic v. City of Gallup, 2013-NMCA-039, 298 P.3d 500.\n\nAn incident does not give rise to a claim until the resulting injury manifests itself in a physically objective manner and is ascertainable. Until these factors are established, the question of fraudulent concealment need not be addressed.Long v. Weaver, 1986-NMCA-108, 105 N.M. 188, 730 P.2d 491.\n\nWhere plaintiff fell in a ditch and broke an ankle, and it was certain at that time that plaintiff had suffered an injury as a consequence of the alleged wrongful act of another for which the law afforded a remedy, the statute of limitations attached. The fact that the full extent of the injury was not known did not affect the running of the statute of limitations.Bolden v. Village of Corrales, 1990-NMCA-096, 111 N.M. 721, 809 P.2d 635, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 77, 801 P.2d 659.\n\nIt is not required that all the damages resulting from the negligent act be known before the statute of limitations begins to run. Once plaintiff suffers loss or injury, the statute begins to run.Bolden v. Village of Corrales, 1990-NMCA-096, 111 N.M. 721, 809 P.2d 635, cert. denied, 111 N.M. 77, 801 P.2d 659.\n\nTime presents factual matter.— Where plaintiffs' complaint alleges that the work took place in the last week of July and into the first week of August 2001, and the city does not appear to dispute this factual claim, but argues that the clean-up work was commenced in the last week of July 2001 and therefore the trigger for the statute of limitations was the date the work began, plaintiffs' allegation about the time the work was performed and when the time the injury manifested itself presents a factual matter that must be resolved.Henderson v. City of Tucumcari, 2005-NMCA-077, 137 N.M. 709, 114 P.3d 389, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-006, 137 N.M. 766, 115 P.3d 229.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Constitutional Torts and the New Mexico Torts Claims Act,\" see 13 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. Every person who claims damages from the state or any local public body under the Tort Claims Act shall cause to be presented to the risk management division for claims against the state, the mayor of the municipality for claims against the municipality, the superintendent of the school district for claims against the school district, the county clerk of a county for claims against the county, or to the administrative head of any other local public body for claims against such local public body, within ninety days after an occurrence giving rise to a claim for which immunity has been waived under the Tort Claims Act, a written notice stating the time, place and circumstances of the loss or injury.\n\nB. No suit or action for which immunity has been waived under the Tort Claims Act shall be maintained and no court shall have jurisdiction to consider any suit or action against the state or any local public body unless notice has been given as required by this section, or unless the governmental entity had actual notice of the occurrence. The time for giving notice does not include the time, not exceeding ninety days, during which the injured person is incapacitated from giving the notice by reason of injury.\n\nC. When a claim for which immunity has been waived under the Tort Claims Act is one for wrongful death, the required notice may be presented by, or on behalf of, the personal representative of the deceased person or any person claiming benefits of the proceeds of a wrongful death action, or the consular officer of a foreign country of which the deceased was a citizen, within six months after the date of the occurrence of the injury which resulted in the death; but if the person for whose death the claim is made has presented a notice that would have been sufficient had he lived, an action for wrongful death may be brought without any additional notice.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-14-14.1, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 386, § 12.\n\nEmergency clauses.— Laws 1977, ch. 386, § 23 contained an emergency clause and was approved April 8, 1977.\n\nConstitutional right to access courts not violated.— The 90-day notice provision of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] does not violate the constitutional right of access to the courts. The legislative purposes requiring timely and reasonable notice to a governmental entity of potential claims are rationally related to legitimate governmental interests such as: (1) to allow investigation of a matter while the evidence is fresh; (2) to allow questioning of witnesses; (3) to protect against stimulated or aggravated claims; or (4) to allow consideration of whether a claim should be paid or not.Powell v. N.M. State Hwy. & Transp. Dep't, 1994-NMCA-035, 117 N.M. 415, 872 P.2d 388, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 524, 873 P.2d 270.\n\nDue process.— The notice requirement is not unreasonably short, thus not constituting a denial of due process.Ferguson v. N.M. State Hwy. Comm'n, 1982-NMCA-180, 99 N.M. 194, 656 P.2d 244, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 226, 656 P.2d 889 (1983).\n\nThe period of giving notice does not deny an incapacitated victim due process of law.Ferguson v. N.M. State Hwy. Comm'n, 1982-NMCA-180, 99 N.M. 194, 656 P.2d 244, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 226, 656 P.2d 889 (1983).\n\nApplication of the notice provision of Subsection A to any minor, whatever the circumstances, would not, in every circumstance, violate due process.Erwin v. City of Santa Fe, 1993-NMCA-065, 115 N.M. 596, 855 P.2d 1060.\n\nSection inapplicable to claims against public employees.— The language of the written notice section does not include, and therefore does not apply to, claims against public employees.Martinez v. City of Clovis, 1980-NMCA-078, 95 N.M. 654, 625 P.2d 583, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 674, 615 P.2d 991.\n\nThe written notice requirement of Subsection A does not apply to public employees, such as a mayor or a police chief.Frappier v. Mergler, 1988-NMCA-021, 107 N.M. 61, 752 P.2d 253.\n\nSection inapplicable to claims only against public employee.— Where a police officer was sued individually in federal court for violation of plaintiff's constitutional rights, the officer asked the municipality to provide a defense and gave a copy of the complaint to the municipal attorney; the municipality refused to provide a defense; the municipality had actual notice of the federal action and was asked to provide a defense within the time for filing an answer to the complaint; the municipality did not dispute that the officer acted within the scope of the officer's employment; the officer defended the federal action pro se; and the officer and plaintiff settled the federal claims; and plaintiff did not give the municipality written notice of the incident within ninety days after the incident occurred, 41-4-16 NMSA 1978 does not require notice to be given by a claimant who sues only a governmental employee and the municipality was required to defend and indemnify the officer and pay the judgment against the officer.Niederstadt v. Town of Carrizozo, 2008-NMCA-053, 143 N.M. 786, 182 P.3d 769, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-003, 143 N.M. 681, 180 P.3d 1180.\n\nPurpose of the notice requirementis four-fold: (1) to enable the person or entity to whom notice must be given, or its insurance company, to investigate the matter while the facts are accessible; (2) to question witnesses; (3) to protect against simulated or aggravated claims; and (4) to consider whether to pay the claim or to refuse it.Ferguson v. N.M. State Hwy. Comm'n, 1982-NMCA-180, 99 N.M. 194, 656 P.2d 244, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 226, 656 P.2d 889 (1983).\n\nAffidavit stating intent to make claims attached to a pleading was sufficient notice.— Where plaintiff, as personal representative of her deceased son's estate, brought a class action complaint for medical and other negligence against the university of New Mexico hospital (UNMH) resulting from treatment provided to pediatric cancer patients at UNMH, the district court erred in dismissing plaintiff's claims on grounds that UNMH did not receive notice of plaintiff's claims as required by the Tort Claims Act, because plaintiff, as representative of her deceased son, fell within the class described in two pending class action lawsuits against UNMH, and UNMH had accepted service of the class action lawsuits, and plaintiff had filed an affidavit in support of a motion to consolidate the two class actions that gave UNMH notice that plaintiff actually intended to make claims against UNMH for losses and injuries allegedly caused by the negligence alleged in the class action complaints.Cummings v. UNM Bd. of Regents, 2019-NMCA-034, cert. denied.\n\nNotice was timely.— Where plaintiff, as personal representative of her deceased son's estate, brought a class action complaint for medical and other negligence against the university of New Mexico hospital (UNMH) resulting from treatment provided to pediatric cancer patients at UNMH, and where plaintiff provided notice of a claim by executing an affidavit stating that plaintiff intended to make claims against UNMH for losses and injuries allegedly caused by the negligence of UNMH, and where the affidavit was filed in a court pleading within six months of plaintiff discovering the facts relevant to her claim against UNMH, the notice to UNMH was timely.Cummings v. UNM Bd. of Regents, 2019-NMCA-034, cert. denied.\n\nPlaintiff's report failed to satisfy the purpose of the notice requirement.— Where the purpose of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] notice requirement is to ensure that the agency allegedly at fault is notified that it may be subject to a lawsuit and to reasonably alert the agency to the necessity of investigating the merits of a potential claim against it, and where plaintiff, a resident physician at the university of New Mexico school of medicine, filed a report with residency administrators alleging that she was raped by a senior resident in the residency program, the report was insufficient to notify defendant of a likelihood that litigation may ensue; the district court did not err in dismissing plaintiff's tort claim for failure to comply with the Tort Claim Act's notice requirement.Herald v. Board of Regents of the Univ. of N.M., 2015-NMCA-104, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-009.\n\nContents of notice.— Subsection B does not require that the notice of a claim under this article indicate that a lawsuit will in fact be filed against the state, but, rather, it contemplates that the state must be given notice of a likelihood that litigation may ensue, in order to reasonably alert it to the necessity of investigating the merits of a potential claim against it.Smith v. State ex rel. N.M. Dep't of Parks & Recreation, 1987-NMCA-111, 106 N.M. 368, 743 P.2d 124.\n\nThe notice required is not simply actual notice of the occurrence of an accident or injury but rather actual notice that there exists a likelihood that litigation may ensue.Dutton v. McKinley Cnty. Bd. of Comm'rs, 1991-NMCA-130, 113 N.M. 51, 822 P.2d 1134.\n\nAlthough the plaintiff claimed that the department had actual notice of this claim because of: (1) the information contained in a police report, (2) information derived from the conversation between a maintenance foreman and the police officer investigating the accident, and (3) the department's special knowledge concerning the hazards of blunt-edged guardrails, there was no evidence that the department had notice that this particular accident was likely to result in litigation against the department, or that the plaintiff considered the accident to be the department's fault. The above factors did not satisfy the requirement of actual notice.Powell v. N.M. State Hwy. & Transp. Dep't, 1994-NMCA-035, 117 N.M. 415, 872 P.2d 388, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 524, 873 P.2d 270.\n\nContents of notice satisfied the written notice requirement.— Where plaintiffs, individually, and on behalf of the estate of decedent, sent a \"Notice of Claims Resulting in Injury/Death\" to the Bernalillo county clerk, the risk management division, and the mayor of the city of Albuquerque, stating that decedent, a minor child, suffered serious injuries and subsequent death after certain government employees failed to properly monitor decedent's alleged killer, who was on probation at the time of the murder, and where plaintiffs subsequently filed a complaint, alleging that the city of Albuquerque, the Albuquerque police department, and unknown officers were negligent in failing to investigate a referral made by the children, youth and families department that arose from an incident before decedent was killed, and where the district court dismissed the complaint, finding that the \"Notice of Claims\" failed to advise the city that the claim related to the duty to investigate a child abuse referral, because the notice referenced a failure to supervise a probationer and thus \"misdirected and thwarted any inquiry into whether the claim should be denied or should be paid,\" the district court erred in dismissing the complaint, because the Notice of Claims stated the time, place, and circumstances of the injury by generally referring to the tortious conduct and negligence by the state, the county, and the city, which caused decedent's injuries and death on August 24, 2016. The city was made aware that a claim could be brought based on the crime committed against decedent and associated negligence and tortious conduct leading to that crime, and therefore the notice provided the city with the information necessary to investigate its involvement with the circumstances leading to decedent's injuries and death.Martens v. City of Albuquerque, 2023-NMCA-037, cert. granted.\n\nTo whom notice necessary.— In an action against the state park and recreation department, for its alleged negligence resulting in a boating accident and ensuing deaths, notice given to both the superintendent of the state park where the drownings occurred and to the boating supervisor at the park, satisfied the notice requirements specified in this section. Notice did not have to be given to the head of the department or its risk management division.Smith v. State ex rel. N.M. Dep't of Parks & Recreation, 1987-NMCA-111, 106 N.M. 368, 743 P.2d 124.\n\nThe \"actual notice\" required by Subsection B is not simply actual notice of the occurrence of an accident or injury but rather, actual notice that there exists a \"likelihood\" that litigation may ensue.Frappier v. Mergler, 1988-NMCA-021, 107 N.M. 61, 752 P.2d 253.\n\nLack of notice relieving state from liability.— State was not responsible, under the Tort Claims Act, for paying a federal court judgment against a penitentiary guard when neither the state nor any of its agencies had notice of either the claim or of the federal court suit.Otero v. State, 1987-NMCA-054, 105 N.M. 731, 737 P.2d 90, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 707, 736 P.2d 985.\n\nNotice begins to run when injury manifests itself.— Where the language of this section's notice provisions and the statute of limitations, 41-4-15 NMSA 1978, is similar, the rule that the statute of limitations period begins to run from the time an injury manifests itself in a physically objective manner and is ascertainable is an applicable precedent to the question of when, under the Tort Claims Act, notice begins to run.Emery v. Univ. of N.M. Med. Ctr., 1981-NMCA-059,96 N.M. 144, 628 P.2d 1140.\n\nNotice defense may not be stricken as insufficient.— The notice defense accorded by this section is a defense under which a defendant may be entitled to relief against a plaintiff's claim and, thus, is not to be stricken as insufficient as a matter of law.Emery v. Univ. of N.M. Med. Ctr., 1981-NMCA-059, 96 N.M. 144, 628 P.2d 1140.\n\nNotice requirements of Subsections A and B may not be applied to bar infant's claim.— One unable to comply with a notice requirement by reason of minority is protected by the reasonableness requirements of the common law and the U.S. Const., amend. XIV, or similar provisions in the state constitution.Tafoya v. Doe, 1983-NMCA-070, 100 N.M. 328, 670 P.2d 582, cert. quashedsub nom., 100 N.M. 327, 670 P.2d 581.\n\nThe 90-day notice provision does not apply to minors who are incapable themselves of meeting that responsibility, and minors may not be held to such notice when their parents or other relatives are shown to be unable to provide notice for them.Rider v. Albuquerque Pub. Sch., 1996-NMCA-090, 122 N.M. 237, 923 P.2d 604.\n\nTwo-year statute of limitations applicable to negligence suit involving public utility's employee.— Section 41-4-15 NMSA 1978 of the Tort Claims Act, allowing two years to bring suit, and not the one-year limitation of 37-1-24 NMSA 1978, which refers to the time for bringing suits in negligence against any city, town or village, or any officers thereof, applies to a suit for negligence of a public employee in the operation of a public utility.Cozart v. Town of Bernalillo, 1983-NMCA-053, 99 N.M. 737, 663 P.2d 713.\n\nNotice to adjustor sufficient.— Notice to an adjustor acting for his principal, and known to the claimant to be the adjustor for the principal, is sufficient notice to satisfy the statute requiring notice to the principal.Martinez v. City of Clovis, 1980-NMCA-078, 95 N.M. 654, 625 P.2d 583, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 674, 615 P.2d 991.\n\nPolice report not \"actual notice\".— An accident report prepared by the state police does not constitute actual notice to the state and to all state agencies. Mere notice of an accident will not necessarily put the government entity on notice that it may become the defendant in a lawsuit.Marrujo v. N.M. State Hwy. Transp. Dep't, 1994-NMSC-116, 118 N.M. 753, 887 P.2d 747.\n\nIncident report at detention center did not give actual notice that litigation was likely to ensue.— Where plaintiff, while incarcerated in the Curry county detention center (CCDC), was assaulted by another inmate, and where the assault was documented in two separate incident reports at the CCDC, and where plaintiff asserted claims against CCDC for violations of the fourteenth amendment and negligence under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, the court was without jurisdiction to hear the case because CCDC did not have actual notice that litigation was likely to ensue, because the incident report, although documenting that an assault took place, did not indicate that any action by the guards or any other detention center personnel led to the incident or contributed in any way to plaintiff's injuries and contained no information that reasonably would have led the county officials to believe litigation against the jail may ensue as a result; actual notice of the incident or injury alone is insufficient.Galvan v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs for Curry Cty., 261 F.Supp.3d 1140 (D. N.M. 2017).\n\nPlaintiff was not incapacitated from giving notice by reason of injury.— Where plaintiff, while incarcerated in the Curry county detention center (CCDC), was assaulted by another inmate, and where plaintiff asserted claims against CCDC for violations of the fourteenth amendment and negligence under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, and where plaintiff failed to comply with this section's 90-day written notice requirement, and the CCDC did not have actual notice that litigation was likely to ensue, plaintiff was not incapacitated from giving the tort claims notice by reason of injury because evidence showed that plaintiff's capacity and capabilities were not meaningfully disrupted by the assault she received or the injuries stemming from it.Galvan v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs for Curry Cty., 261 F.Supp.3d 1140 (D. N.M. 2017).\n\nActual notice requires notice that there exists a likelihood that litigation may ensue.— Where plaintiff filed a lawsuit asserting claims against the Bernalillo county metropolitan detention center (BCMDC) for violations of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act after a state district court remanded plaintiff to BCMDC to participate in a methadone program to decrease his level of dependence so that he would not incur life endangering withdrawal symptoms, but where plaintiff suffered life threatening withdrawal symptoms for approximately two months after being transferred to the New Mexico Corrections Department in contravention of the state district court's order, the federal district court was without jurisdiction over the tort claims, because plaintiff did not provide written notice to Bernalillo county and there was not sufficient evidence showing that Bernalillo county had actual notice that there existed a likelihood that litigation may ensue in order to reasonably alert the county to the necessity of investigating the merits of the potential claim.Gallegos v. Bernalillo County Board of County Commissioners, 278 F.Supp.3d 1245 (D.N.M. 2017).\n\nReport serves as notice if governmental entity made aware of claim.— Under some circumstances, a police or other report could serve as actual notice under Subsection B, but only where the report contains information which puts the governmental entity allegedly at fault on notice that there is a claim against it.Guerra, City of Las Cruces v. Garcia, 1984-NMSC-106, 102 N.M. 25, 690 P.2d 1019.\n\nReport may serve as notice if agency has knowledge of potential liability.— When the governmental entity allegedly at fault has knowledge of the facts and circumstances of an occurrence, it may have knowledge of its own potential liability, and a particular statement by a victim that there may be a claim is not required.Lopez v. State, 1996-NMSC-071, 122 N.M. 611, 930 P.2d 146.\n\nNotice provisions operate as statutes of limitationssince they are conditions precedent to filing a suit.Ferguson v. N.M. State Hwy. Comm'n, 1982-NMCA-180, 99 N.M. 194, 656 P.2d 244, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 226, 656 P.2d 889 (1983).\n\nIf governmental entity creates condition that causes injury, notice is still requiredof a claim for damages. This section operates in conjunction with 41-4-15 NMSA 1978, the statute of limitations section, on the issue of a timely claim.Tafoya v. Doe, 1983-NMCA-070, 100 N.M. 328, 670 P.2d 582, cert. quashed sub nom., 100 N.M. 327, 670 P.2d 581.\n\nActual notice of accident.— An evidentiary hearing may be required to decide the threshold issue whether, from actual notice of an occurrence, a governmental entity was on notice that it could be subject to a claim.Lopez v. State, 1996-NMSC-071, 122 N.M. 611, 930 P.2d 146.\n\nBurden of proof that notice requirements not met.— It is the defendants' burden to sustain their defense that the notice requirements had not been met.Ferguson v. N.M. State Hwy. Comm'n, 1981-NMCA-071, 98 N.M. 718, 652 P.2d 740,rev'd on other grounds, 1982-NMSC-107, 98 N.M. 680, 652 P.2d 230.\n\nPolice accident report not \"actual notice\".— An accident report prepared by the New Mexico state police does not constitute \"actual notice,\" within the meaning of Subsection B, to the state and to all state agencies.N.M. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Ferguson, 1982-NMSC-107, 98 N.M. 680, 652 P.2d 230.\n\nWeight given statements made in workmen's compensation suits.— Since cases arising under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] almost always present issues of first impression, statements made in workmen's compensation (now workers' compensation) suits regarding the reason for notice should be accorded great weight.Martinez v. City of Clovis, 1980-NMCA-078, 95 N.M. 654, 625 P.2d 583, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 674, 615 P.2d 991.\n\nFederal preemption.— The Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] notice-of-claim requirement is preempted by the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd, and, therefore, is not applicable to an Emergency Act claim.Godwin v. Mem'l Med. Ctr., 2001-NMCA-033, 130 N.M. 434, 25 P.3d 273, cert. quashed, 132 N.M. 193, 46 P.3d 100, and cert. denied, 537 U.S. 885, 123 S. Ct. 118, 154 L. Ed. 2d 144 (2002).\n\nSummary judgment inappropriate.— Where undisputed facts of the case allow the trier of fact to draw equally logical but conflicting inferences from the facts, summary judgment on the issue of whether the department of corrections had actual notice of the occurrence as required by subsection B is not appropriate.Calloway v. N.M. Dep't of Corr., 1994-NMCA-049, 117 N.M. 637, 875 P.2d 393, cert. denied, 118 N.M. 90, 879 P.2d 91.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Constitutional Torts and the New Mexico Torts Claims Act,\" see 13 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. The Tort Claims Act shall be the exclusive remedy against a governmental entity or public employee for any tort for which immunity has been waived under the Tort Claims Act and no other claim, civil action or proceeding for damages, by reason of the same occurrence, may be brought against a governmental entity or against the public employee or his estate whose act or omission gave rise to the suit or claim. No rights of a governmental entity to contribution, indemnity or subrogation shall be impaired by this section, except a governmental entity or any insurer of a governmental entity shall have no right to contribution, indemnity or subrogation against a public employee unless the public employee has been found to have acted fraudulently or with actual intentional malice causing the bodily injury, wrongful death, property damage or violation of rights, privileges or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the United States or laws of New Mexico resulting in the settlement or final judgment. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any proceedings for mandamus, prohibition, habeas corpus, certiorari, injunction or quo warranto.\n\nB. The settlement or judgment in an action under the Tort Claims Act shall constitute a complete bar to any action by the claimant, by reason of the same occurrence against a governmental entity or the public employee whose negligence gave rise to the claim.\n\nC. No action brought pursuant to the provisions of the Tort Claims Act shall name as a party any insurance company insuring any risk for which immunity has been waived by that act.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-14-15, enacted by Laws 1976, ch. 58, § 15; 1977, ch. 386, § 13; 1982, ch. 8, § 2.\n\nApplication of 1977 amendment.— Where an act giving rise to a claim under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] occurred prior to the effective date of the 1977 amendment which added \"settlement\" to Subsection B, but the injury and settlement occurred after the effective date, the settlement is governed by the amended subsection.Sugarman v. City of Las Cruces, 1980-NMCA-093, 95 N.M. 706, 625 P.2d 1223.\n\nWhen settlement does not bar suit.— A suit authorized by the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] and brought against the potentially liable governmental entity is not barred by a settlement with one who has no statutory liability to the claimant, nor by a settlement reached with anyone outside the framework of a Tort Claims Act suit.Sugarman v. City of Las Cruces, 1980-NMCA-093, 95 N.M. 706, 625 P.2d 1223.\n\nTwo-year statute of limitations applicable to negligence suit involving public utility's employee.— Section 41-4-15 NMSA 1978 of the Tort Claims Act, allowing two years to bring suit, and not the one-year limitation of 37-1-24 NMSA 1978, which refers to the time for bringing suits in negligence against any city, town or village, or any officers thereof, applies to a suit for negligence of a public employee in the operation of a public utility.Cozart v. Town of Bernalillo, 1983-NMCA-053, 99 N.M. 737, 663 P.2d 713.\n\nSimultaneous pursual of § 1983 action not barred.— The New Mexico Tort Claims Act does not prohibit a plaintiff from bringing an action for damages under that act against a governmental entity or public employee where the plaintiff also pursues, by reason of the same occurrence or chain of events, an action against the same entity or employee pursuant to the Federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983.Wells v. County of Valencia, 1982-NMSC-048, 98 N.M. 3, 644 P.2d 517.\n\nDouble recovery prohibited.— In those cases where tort damages will constitute a portion of the damages for a deprivation of a constitutional right, general principles against double recovery will prevail.Wells v. Cnty. of Valencia, 1982-NMSC-048, 98 N.M. 3, 644 P.2d 517.\n\nCity entitled to \"exclusive remedy\" provisions.— The operation of a natural gas system, even though beyond the statutory limitations imposed by 3-25-3A(2) NMSA 1978, does not deprive a city of the exclusive right, remedy and obligation provision of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Cole v. City of Las Cruces, 1983-NMSC-007, 99 N.M. 302, 657 P.2d 629.\n\nParties.— The exclusive remedy provision in Subsection B did not bar recovery from the state transportation division of the state board of education because plaintiffs settled their claims against defendants connected with a county and school district.Gallegos v. State Bd. of Educ., 1997-NMCA-040, 123 N.M. 362, 940 P.2d 468, cert. denied, 123 N.M. 215, 937 P.2d 76.\n\nJoinder.— Prior to the enactment of Subsection C, there was nothing in the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] which indicated the legislature's intention to disallow a plaintiff bringing an action under the act from joining an insurance company as a party defendant. By drawing a logical inference from the legislature's subsequent enactment of Subsection C, it appears that the legislature realized that without this subsection a plaintiff could join the insurance company and therefore this prompted the 1977 amendment which specifically negated the idea of joinder.England v. N.M. State Hwy. Comm'n, 1978-NMSC-005, 91 N.M. 406, 575 P.2d 96.\n\nIn any action which falls within the purview of the Tort Claims Act where the injury occurred between July 1, 1976, and February of 1977, when the 1977 amendments became immediately effective, joinder of an insurance company as a party defendant is allowed.England v. N.M. State Hwy. Comm'n, 1978-NMSC-005, 91 N.M. 406, 575 P.2d 96. (This section was amended by Laws 1977, which contained an emergency clause, Laws 1977, ch. 386, § 23, and was approved April 8, 1977.)\n\nWrongful decision to perform autopsy.— In an action for damages on the basis of an alleged wrongful decision to perform an autopsy, even if 24-12-4 NMSA 1978, which provides for consent for post-mortem examinations, created a private cause of action, it did not override the state medical investigator's grant of immunity under the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978].Begay v. State, 1985-NMCA-117, 104 N.M. 483, 723 P.2d 252,rev'd on other grounds,Smialek v. Begay, 1986-NMSC-049, 104 N.M. 375, 721 P.2d 1306, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1020, 93 L. Ed. 2d 727, 107 S. Ct. 677.\n\nGovernmental entity not entitled to reimbursement from employee.— A school district was not entitled to reimbursement from an employee of federal funds it lost due to the employee's negligence in failing to comply with federal regulations.Daddow v. Carlsbad Mun. Sch. Dist., 1995-NMSC-032, 120 N.M. 97, 898 P.2d 1235.\n\nNo waiver of liability for intentional torts.— Where Indian tribe brought an action against the state of New Mexico, the governor of New Mexico, and members of the gaming control board, alleging tortious interference with existing contractual relations, the New Mexico officials were entitled to qualified immunity because the New Mexico Tort Claims Act does not waive liability for intentional torts; as a result, New Mexico officials cannot be held liable for tortious interference with contractual relations.Pueblo of Pojoaque v. N.M., 214 F.Supp.3d 1028 (D. N.M. 2016).\n\nMandamus proceedings not prohibited.— The Tort Claims Act does not interfere with the traditional right to bring a mandamus action against a government official for failure to perform a required duty.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Risk Mgmt. Div., 1995-NMSC-046, 120 N.M. 178, 899 P.2d 1132.\n\nInjunction.— Although the Tort Claims Act would not bar a claim for injunctive relief, an injunction will generally not lie if there is an adequate remedy at law.El Dorado Utils., Inc. v. Eldorado Area Water & Sanitation Dist., 2005-NMCA-036, 137 N.M. 217, 109 P.3d 305.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Constitutional Torts and the New Mexico Torts Claims Act,\" see 13 N.M.L.

Venue for any claim against the state or its public employees, pursuant to the Tort Claims Act, shall be in the district court for the county in which a plaintiff resides, or in which the cause of action arose, or in Santa Fe county. Venue for all other claims pursuant to the Tort Claims Act, shall be in the county in which the principal offices of the governing body of the local public body are located.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-14-16, enacted by Laws 1976, ch. 58, § 16.\n\nSection is unconstitutional to extent that it acts to limit pendent jurisdictionof a federal district court over tort claims against counties, municipalities, and their officers.Wojciechowski v. Harriman, 607 F. Supp. 631 (D.N.M. 1985).\n\nConstitutional deprivation may be remedied in a jurisdiction other than New Mexico.Wells v. County of Valencia, 1982-NMSC-048, 98 N.M. 3, 644 P.2d 517.\n\nFederal jurisdiction barred.— Inmate could not pursue claim against the New Mexico Department of Corrections and its employees acting within the scope of their employment in the federal district court, but rather was relegated to the state district court to seek relief consistent with the limited waiver of immunity under this section.Bishop v. Doe 1, 902 F.2d 809 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 873, 111 S. Ct. 198, 112 L. Ed. 2d 159 (1990).\n\nVenue provisions are mandatory.— The second sentence of Subsection B, relating to venue of actions against public entities or employees other than the state and its employees, was mandatory as applied to action against board of county commissioners.Williams v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1998-NMCA-090, 125 N.M. 445, 963 P.2d 522, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 654, 964 P.2d 818.\n\nSuit against state hospital in federal court not permitted.— Congress does not have the power to make statutes such as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) applicable to state-run hospitals without the state's express consent. As indicated by this, 41-4-2 NMSA 1978 and 41-4-4 NMSA 1978, New Mexico has not consented to be sued in federal court for violations of EMTALA, nor for any other tort.Ward v. Presbyterian Healthcare Servs., 72 F. Supp. 2d 1285 (D.N.M. 1999).\n\nTwo-year statute of limitations applicable to negligence suit involving public utility's employee.— Section 41-4-15 NMSA 1978 of the Tort Claims Act, allowing two years to bring suit, and not the one-year limitation of 37-1-24 NMSA 1978, which refers to the time for bringing suits in negligence against any city, town or village, or any officers thereof, applies to a suit for negligence of a public employee in the operation of a public utility.Cozart v. Town of Bernalillo, 1983-NMCA-053, 99 N.M. 737, 663 P.2d 713.\n\nVenue in actions against state educational institutions.— The venue provision of this section does not delimit choice of forum for tort actions brought against state educational institutions, which actions are governed by the venue provision set forth in 38-3-1G NMSA 1978.Clothier v. Lopez, 1985-NMSC-088, 103 N.M. 593, 711 P.2d 870.\n\nFederal jurisdiction barred.— A student at the New Mexico School of Mines (now New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology), was barred from bringing an action in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, seeking damages for personal injuries alleged to have resulted from the negligence of the school's board of regents in the operation of the school, because the action was, in effect, against the state of New Mexico, and the U.S. Const., amend. XI, barred federal jurisdiction.Korgich v. Regents of N.M. Sch. of Mines, 582 F.2d 549 (10th Cir. 1978).\n\nTexas' sovereign immunity recognized as a matter of comity in tort claim lawsuit.— In a medical negligence case filed against a Texas-based physician who was acting within the scope of his employment at Texas tech hospital, a governmental unit of the state of Texas, the district court erred in failing to extend comity to Texas and apply provisions of the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA), because it is not a violation of New Mexico public policy when a similar action would not be barred under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, when Texas appellate courts have previously extended comity and applied tort claims provisions from other jurisdictions that differed from the TTCA's provisions, when Texas' strong public policy interest in applying uniform standards of liability and immunity to the conduct of state-employed physicians who provide medical care at state-run facilities is not outweighed by New Mexico's interest in providing a forum for New Mexicans who seek redress for medical negligence, and when failing to extend immunity to Texas in this case would encourage forum shopping by allowing plaintiffs to name Texas state employees in lawsuits in New Mexico when those plaintiffs could not do so in Texas.Monta o v. Frezza, 2017-NMSC-015,rev'g, 2015-NMCA-069.\n\nPrinciples of comity applied to determine choice of law when tort is committed by non-resident.— Comity, the principle that the courts of one state give effect to the laws of another state or extend immunity to a sister sovereign, not as a rule of law, but rather out of deference or respect, should be extended to other states but only if doing so will not violate or undermine New Mexico's public policies. In determining whether to extend immunity, courts should consider whether the forum state would enjoy similar immunity under similar circumstances, whether the state sued has or is likely to extend immunity to other states, whether the forum state has a strong interest in litigating the case, and whether extending immunity would prevent forum shopping.Monta o v. Frezza, 2015-NMCA-069, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-006, and cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-006.\n\nIn a medical negligence case filed against a Texas-based physician, where the district court was required to determine whether the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (NMTCA) [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] or Texas law should apply, the district court did not err in determining that New Mexico law should apply because applying Texas law would be contrary to New Mexico's public policies in that applying Texas law would contravene New Mexico's broader waiver of immunity, would limit suits to governmental entities and prohibit suits against individuals, and would impose a notice requirement substantially more restrictive than that in the NMTCA.Monta o v. Frezza, 2015-NMCA-069, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-006, and cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-006.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Constitutional Torts and the New Mexico Torts Claims Act,\" see 13 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. Unless limited by Subsection B of this section, in any action for damages against a governmental entity or a public employee while acting within the scope of the employee's duties as provided in the Tort Claims Act, the liability shall not exceed:\n\n(1) the sum of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) for each legally described real property for damage to or destruction of that legally described real property arising out of a single occurrence;\n\n(2) the sum of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) for all past and future medical and medically related expenses arising out of a single occurrence; and\n\n(3) the sum of four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000) to any person for any number of claims arising out of a single occurrence for all damages other than real property damage and medical and medically related expenses as permitted under the Tort Claims Act.\n\nB. The total liability for all claims pursuant to Paragraphs (1) and (3) of Subsection A of this section that arise out of a single occurrence shall not exceed seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000).\n\nC. Interest shall be allowed on judgments against a governmental entity or public employee for a tort for which immunity has been waived under the Tort Claims Act at a rate equal to two percentage points above the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the date of the entry of the judgment. Interest shall be computed daily from the date of the entry of the judgment until the date of payment.\n\nD. No judgment against a governmental entity or public employee for any tort for which immunity has been waived under the Tort Claims Act shall include an award for exemplary or punitive damages or for interest prior to judgment.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-14-3, enacted by Laws 1976, ch. 58, § 17; 1977, ch. 386, § 14; 1991, ch. 205, § 3; 2004, ch. 108, § 1; 2007, ch. 121, § 1.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective July 1, 2008, increased the maximum liability from $100,000 to $200,000 for damage or destruction of each legally described real property; and limited the total liability for all claims arising out of a single occurrence to not more that $750,000.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2007, ch. 121, § 2 provided that Laws 2007, ch. 121, §1 applied only to claims for damages from torts committed on or after July 1, 2008.\n\nThe 2004 amendment,effective May 19, 2004, added Subsection B and redesignated former Subsection B as present Subsection C.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective July 1, 1992, in Subsection A, added Paragraph (2), redesignated former Paragraphs (2) and (3) as Paragraphs (3) and (4), substituted \"four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000)\" for \"three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000)\" and inserted \"and medical and medically-related expenses\" in Paragraph (3), and substituted \"seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000)\" for \"five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000)\" and inserted \"other than medical or medically-related expenses\" in Paragraph (4).\n\nThe cap on damages is constitutional.— The cap on damages does not violate substantive due process or equal protection and does not encroach on the right to trial by jury or the Separation of Powers Clause.Wachocki v. Bernalillo Cnty. Sheriff's Dep't, 2010-NMCA-021, 147 N.M. 720, 228 P.3d 504,aff'd, 2011-NMSC-039, 150 N.M. 650, 265 P.3d 701.\n\nCap on damages.— In considering the constitutionality of the cap on damages in Subsection A(2), the trial court was mistaken in limiting the facts applicable solely to the defendant city; the city had the burden of demonstrating that enforcement of the cap was substantially related to an important state interest, and the trial court should have considered evidence on the relationship of the cap to public treasuries as an indivisible and statewide whole, both at the time the cap was enacted and at the time the causes of action accrued;Trujillo v. City of Albuquerque, 1990-NMSC-083, 110 N.M. 621, 798 P.2d 571 is withdrawn.Trujillo v. City of Albuquerque, 1995-NMSC-027, 119 N.M. 602, 893 P.2d 1006.\n\nBecause the statutory cap on tort recoveries against the state affects economic interests, not fundamental rights, the appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny in an equal protection challenge is rational basis review, not the intermediate scrutiny necessary for statutes affecting fundamental rights.Trujillo v. City of Albuquerque, 1998-NMSC-031, 125 N.M. 721, 965 P.2d 305.\n\nWrongful death action brought by a personal representative is a single claim.— A personal representative, whether consisting of one or more individuals, is the \"person\" for purposes of 41-4-19A(3) NMSA 1978 because under the Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.] the personal representative of the deceased person replaces the deceased person and has the sole right to pursue the action on behalf of the statutory beneficiaries. A wrongful death action brought by a personal representative on behalf of multiple statutory beneficiaries is a single claim under 41-4-19A(3) NMSA 1978, rather than multiple claims under 41-4-19A(4) NMSA 1978.Estate of Lajeuenesse v. UNM Bd. of Regents, 2013-NMCA-004, 292 P.3d 485, cert. quashed, 2013-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere the personal representative of the decedent sued defendants for the wrongful death of the decedent based on the negligent medical care provided by defendants; no claims were made by any person other than the personal representative; and the jury awarded plaintiff damages of $750,000, the district court properly applied the monetary limitation of 41-4-19A(3) NMSA 1978, rather than multiple claims limitation under 41-4-19A(4) NMSA 1978, to reduce the verdict to $400,000 because the wrongful death action was a single claim, not multiple claims.Estate of Lajeuenesse v. UNM Bd. of Regents, 2013-NMCA-004, 292 P.3d 485, cert. quashed, 2013-NMCERT-001.\n\nDouble costs provision of Rule 1-068 NMRA does not conflict with the Tort Claims Act.— The double costs awarded under Paragraph A of Rule 1-068 NMRA are not punitive damages or prejudgment interest and are not prohibited by Subsection D of 41-4-19 NMSA 1978.Estate of Lajeuenesse v. UNM Bd. of Regents, 2013-NMCA-004, 292 P.3d 485, cert. quashed, 2013-NMCERT-001.\n\nRecovery of costs.— The legislature, in 39-3-30 NMSA 1978, gives express authority, without exception, to the recovery of costs against any losing party, including the state.Kirby v. N.M. State Hwy. Dep't, 1982-NMCA-014, 97 N.M. 692, 643 P.2d 256, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 51, 644 P.2d 1040.\n\nPostjudgment interest.— Plaintiff in wrongful death action was not entitled to postjudgment interest on a prior judgment obtained against the New Mexico State Highway Department.Fought v. State, 1988-NMCA-088, 107 N.M. 715, 764 P.2d 142,overruled in part on other grounds,Folz v. State, 1993-NMCA-066, 115 N.M. 639, 857 P.2d 39, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 602, 856 P.2d 250.\n\nAn award of postjudgment interest on judgments against a governmental entity is not permitted under this article.Yardman v. San Juan Downs, Inc., 1995-NMCA-106, 120 N.M. 751, 906 P.2d 742, cert. denied, 120 N.M. 636, 904 P.2d 1061.\n\n\"Single occurrence\" construed.— In a negligence action against a city for injuries sustained in a collision with a city-owned crane, there was but a single occurrence when successive negligent acts or omissions of the governmental entity combined concurrently to create a singular risk of collision and to proximately cause injury triggered by a discrete event.Trujillo v. City of Albuquerque, 1990-NMSC-083, 110 N.M. 621, 798 P.2d 571.\n\nIn a wrongful death and personal injury action brought against the state highway department and others for deaths and injuries from a runaway truck, all injuries proximately caused by a governmental agency's successive negligent acts or omissions that combined concurrently to create a singular, separate, and unitary risk of harm fell within the meaning of a \"single occurrence\" when triggered by the discrete event of one runaway truck.Folz v. State, 1990-NMSC-075, 110 N.M. 457, 797 P.2d 246.\n\nIn an action against a county race track by a jockey who was injured when the horse veered, causing the jockey to fall and strike a post and track rail, the county's failure to replace the rail with a safer system and negligent placement of an exit gap on the rail were not separate occurrences; the plaintiff's injuries, which were alleged to have been caused by successive negligent acts or omissions that combined concurrently to create a risk of harm, constituted a single occurrence.Yardman v. San Juan Downs, Inc., 1995-NMCA-106, 120 N.M. 751, 906 P.2d 742, cert. denied, 120 N.M. 636, 904 P.2d 1061.\n\nJury consideration of aggravating circumstances not punitive damages.— In a wrongful death action in which the state was a defendant, an instruction allowing the jury to consider mitigating or aggravating circumstances in setting compensatory damages did not violate the prohibition on punitive damages contained in Subsection B.Folz v. State, 1990-NMSC-075, 110 N.M. 457, 797 P.2d 246.\n\nApplicability to claim under federal law.— The Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978] limits the damages available under the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, 42 U.S.C.S. § 1395dd, by placing a \"cap\" on damages recoverable under the act from a public hospital.Godwin v.

Except as provided in Subsections B and C of this section, local public bodies shall obtain coverage for all risks for which immunity has been waived under the Tort Claims Act pursuant to Sections 41-4-9, 41-4-10 and 41-4-12 NMSA 1978 through the public liability fund by paying into the fund an assessment, to be determined by the director of the risk management division, which shall be based on the risks to be insured. In addition, any local public body upon application to the risk management division may obtain coverage for any risk for which immunity has been waived under the Tort Claims Act through the public liability fund if the director of the risk management division determines that:\n\n(1) the risk is, in fact, commercially uninsurable or insurable only at a cost or subject to conditions which the director deems unreasonable. To make this determination, the director may require the local public body to submit such information as he deems appropriate and may also seek information from any other source; and\n\n(2) the local public body has paid all insurance premiums and public liability fund assessments in a timely manner or has had good cause for failing to do so. The local public body shall pay for coverage of uninsurable risks by paying into the fund an assessment, to be determined by the director, which shall be based on risks to be insured. However, payment of all or part of any such assessment may be deferred or postponed without penalty until future years if the local public body certifies to the director's satisfaction that it has insufficient funds available to pay all or a part of any assessment. A municipality or county shall be deemed to have insufficient funds only if it is, in the current fiscal year, levying the full property tax millage allotted it under law and, in addition, has levied during the current fiscal year a five-mill levy above the constitutional twenty-mill limit to pay tort judgments. Any deferred or postponed assessment is payable in any succeeding fiscal year, subject to the same limitations on duty to pay, until paid in full.\n\nB. A municipality which has adopted a charter pursuant to Article 10, Section 6 of the constitution of New Mexico may, by ordinance of the governing body, elect to create a \"municipal public liability fund\" to insure or otherwise cover any risk for which immunity has been waived under the Tort Claims Act. A municipal public liability fund created pursuant to this subsection shall provide that:\n\n(1) the fund and any income from the fund shall be held in trust, deposited in a segregated account and invested in accordance with law;\n\n(2) any money deposited in the fund may only be expended to purchase liability insurance; to contract with one or more consulting or claims adjusting firms; to defend, save harmless and indemnify any employee of the municipality for any liability covered by the municipal public liability fund; to contract with one or more attorneys or law firms on a per-hour basis to defend tort liability claims against the municipality and its officers and employees acting within the scope of their duties; and to create a retention fund adequate to cover all uninsured risks of the municipality;\n\n(3) if the municipal public liability fund will be exhausted by the payment of all judgments and claims allowed during a particular fiscal year, amounts paid to each claimant or person obtaining a judgment shall be prorated, with each person receiving an amount equal to the percentage his own payment bears to the total of claims and judgments outstanding and payable from the fund. Any amounts due and unpaid as a result of such proration shall be paid in the following fiscal year;\n\n(4) no tort, civil rights or workers' compensation judgment shall be paid by a tax levy upon real or personal property unless the judgment exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). The tax levy shall be made only on that portion of the judgment which is in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). Judgments arising out of a single occurrence shall be paid by tax levies for the portions of the judgments in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000);\n\n(5) the governing body shall review all judgments set forth in Paragraph (4) of this subsection prior to transmitting them to the county assessor for inclusion in the property tax assessment. The review by the governing body shall include a finding by the governing body that the judgment properly arose under the Workers' Compensation Act [Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978] or under the Tort Claims Act. After so finding, the governing body shall by resolution direct the county assessor to provide an assessment as required; and\n\n(6) the ordinance shall not become effective until the department of finance and administration and the general services department have reviewed and approved the ordinance as complying with all of the provisions of this subsection.\n\nC. A local public body, other than one that has adopted a charter pursuant to Article 10, Section 6 of the constitution of New Mexico, may elect to obtain coverage from the public liability fund in accordance with Subsection A of this section or may:\n\n(1) purchase commercial insurance coverage for the risks for which immunity is waived under the Tort Claims Act; or\n\n(2) obtain coverage for the risks for which immunity is waived under the Tort Claims Act in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3, Article 62 NMSA 1978.\n\nD. The risk management division may assess any local public body with a risk covered by the public liability fund:\n\n(1) a penalty in a percentage or minimum amount to be fixed by the director of the risk management division, with the advice of the board, for the failure to make timely payment of any assessment of the division; or\n\n(2) a surcharge not exceeding seventy-five percent of the rate established by the division for coverage under the public liability fund, if:\n\n(a) the local public body fails to meet any of the underwriting standards or claims procedures prescribed by regulations of the division; or\n\n(b) the local public body fails to carry out any safety program prescribed by regulations of the division.\n\nE. Any school district as defined in Section 22-1-2 NMSA 1978 or educational institution established pursuant to Chapter 21, Article 13, 16 or 17 NMSA 1978 may, upon application to and acceptance by the risk management division, purchase, if the coverage is commercially unavailable, any coverage offered by the division, through the public liability fund, including school bus coverage for school bus contractors, notwithstanding the limitation in Subsection E of Section 41-4-3 NMSA 1978; except that coverage other than for risks for which immunity has been waived pursuant to Sections 41-4-9, 41-4-10, 41-4-12 and 41-4-28 NMSA 1978 shall be provided to a school district only through the public school group insurance authority or its successor, unless the district has been granted a waiver by the authority or the authority is not offering the coverage for the fiscal year for which the division offers its coverage. A local school district to which the division may provide coverage may provide for marketing and servicing to be done by licensed insurance agents who shall receive reasonable compensation for their services.\n\nF. If any local public body fails to insure or otherwise cover any risk, the immunity for which has been waived under the provisions of the Tort Claims Act, any resident of the local public body shall have standing to bring suit to compel compliance with the provisions of the Tort Claims Act. Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow any recovery against any governmental entity for any damages resulting from the failure of the governmental entity to insure or otherwise cover any risk.\n\nG. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the risk management division to provide coverage to any local public body, except coverage for those risks for which immunity has been waived under Sections 41-4-9, 41-4-10 and 41-4-12 NMSA 1978, or as requiring the division to provide coverage on terms deemed to be unreasonable by the director of the division.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-14-20.3, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 386, § 19; 1978, ch. 166, § 5; 1979, ch. 10, § 1; 1979, ch. 392, § 3; 1983, ch. 301, § 76; 1986, ch. 27, § 1; 1986, ch. 102, § 9; 1988, ch. 57, § 1; 1989, ch. 372, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The reference to Subsection E of 41-4-3 NMSA 1978 in Subsection E is probably incorrect, since Subsection F of 41-4-3 NMSA 1978 now relates to public employees, following the 1993 amendment to that section.\n\nCross references.— For county assessor,seeChapter 4, Article 39 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor department of finance and administration,see9-6-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor general services department,see9-17-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor risk management division,see15-7-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective June 16, 1989, in Subsection A substituted \"Subsections B and C\" for \"Subsection B\" near the beginning of the first sentence in the introductory paragraph; made a minor stylistic change in Subsection B(4); added present Subsection C; redesignated former Subsections C through F as present Subsections D through G; and substituted \"board\" for \"risk management advisory board\" in Subsection D(1).\n\nThe 1988 amendment,effective May 18, 1988, deleted \"having a population over one hundred thousand\" following \"municipality\" in the first sentence of Subsection B and substituted \"Workers' Compensation Act\" for \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" in the first sentence of Subsection B(5).\n\nTwo-year statute of limitations applicable to negligence suit involving public utility's employee.— Section 41-4-15 NMSA 1978 of the Tort Claims Act [41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978], allowing two years to bring suit, and not the one-year limitation of 37-1-24 NMSA 1978, which refers to the time for bringing suits in negligence against any city, town or village, or any officers thereof, applies to a suit for negligence of a public employee in the operation of a public utility.Cozart v.
