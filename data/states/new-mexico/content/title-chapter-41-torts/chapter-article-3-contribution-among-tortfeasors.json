      "text": "For the purposes of this act [41-3-1 to 41-3-8 NMSA 1978] the term \"joint tortfeasors\" means two or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 21-118, enacted by Laws 1947, ch. 121, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 24-1-11.\n\nCross references.— For liability of employer under Worker's Compensation Act,see52-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nProportional indemnification.— Proportional indemnification need not apply when a factfinder makes a determination that a concurrent tortfeasor is proportionally liable to an injured party. By adopting pure comparative negligence and several liability, the supreme court has already created a system in which each concurrent tortfeasor is liable only for the percentage of damages that is attributable to his or her fault. Similarly, proportional indemnification does not apply when the statute provides for proration of damages among joint tortfeasors. Under the statute, if one tortfeasor has been held liable for more than that his or her share of the fault, that tortfeasor may seek contribution from others who were at fault.Amrep Sw., Inc. v. Shollenbarger Wood Treating, Inc., 1995-NMSC-020, 119 N.M. 542, 893 P.2d 438.\n\nThe Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act does not apply to defendants suedunder vicarious liability theories, because vicarious liability is a legal fiction imputing wrongdoing of an agent to a principal who are not joint tortfeasors.Valdez v. R-Way, LLC, 2010-NMCA-068, 148 N.M. 477, 237 P.3d 1289, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-006, 148 N.M. 583, 241 P.3d 181.\n\nEmployer liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior.— Where an employer's liability arises only by virtue of the doctrine of respondeat superior, and not through any independent negligence of the employer, the employer and the employee are not true joint tortfeasors.Valdez v. R-Way, LLC, 2010-NMCA-068, 148 N.M. 477, 237 P.3d 1289, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-006, 148 N.M. 583, 241 P.3d 181.\n\nWhere plaintiff's vehicle was rear-ended by a vehicle driven by defendant's employee; plaintiff sued defendant's employee for negligence and claimed that defendant was vicariously liable based on respondeat superior; plaintiff and defendant's employee settled; plaintiff fully released defendant's employee for all claims arising from the accident; in the release, plaintiff specifically preserved plaintiff's claim against defendant, the release of defendant's employee released defendant despite the reservation of plaintiff's claim against defendant because defendant's liability was imputed solely based on the negligent conduct of defendant's employee, without fault of defendant, and the release of defendant's employee removed the basis on which defendant's fault was imputed.Valdez v. R-Way, LLC, 2010-NMCA-068, 148 N.M. 477, 237 P.3d 1289, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-006, 148 N.M. 583, 241 P.3d 181.\n\nVoluntary dismissal of claim against agent extinguished claim against the principal.— Where plaintiff, the personal representative of the estate of decedent, filed a wrongful death and personal injury action against Presbyterian hospital and ten doctors, alleging that decedent, who was seventy-one years old, went to Presbyterian hospital emergency room with complaints of generalized weakness, chest pain, and fatigue, and that doctors in the emergency room discharged decedent after failing to diagnose decedent's pneumonia and misdiagnosing him with arthritis, and where decedent died two days later of pneumonia, and where the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the radiologist who reviewed x-rays of decedent's chest during his stay at the hospital, the district court did not err in granting Presbyterian hospital's motion for summary judgment, because once plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her claim with prejudice against the radiologist, her claim against Presbyterian hospital was extinguished. A release of the agent extinguishes the derivative claim against the principal since an agent and a principal are not joint tortfeasors.Trujillo v. Presbyterian, 2024-NMCA-004, cert. granted.\n\nInsufficient evidence of joint venture or co-employment between parent company and subsidiary.— In a wrongful death lawsuit, where it was determined that the decedent's death was caused by the negligence of defendants, an assisted living facility and three upstream entities in its ownership chain, which plaintiff alleged were joint venturers and co-employers of the staff of the assisted living facility, the district court erred in denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict on plaintiff's theories of joint venture and co-employment and in entering judgment against all four entities jointly and severally, because absent veil piercing, a parent corporation cannot be held vicariously liable in tort as a simultaneous co-employer of its subsidiary's employees, and because the assisted living facility's parent companies structured their businesses to limit losses to the extent of their investments downstream, it is inappropriate for a court to imply a joint venture where it is evident that there is a different business form involved and where there was no evidence whatsoever of any right by the parent company to exercise control over the subsidiary.Wirth v. Sun Healthcare Group, Inc., 2017-NMCA-007.\n\nApplicability of act.— This act is applicable only in instances where joint tortfeasors share a common liability.Beal ex rel. Boatwright v. Southern Union Gas Co., 1956-NMSC-113, 62 N.M. 38, 304 P.2d 566.\n\nLegislative intent.— It is unreasonable to assume that the New Mexico legislature intended to grant the right of contribution to wrongdoers in pari delicto and take away from persons guilty only of imputed or constructive wrong the right to indemnity from the primary wrongdoer.Thomas v. Malco Refineries, Inc., 214 F.2d 884 (10th Cir. 1954).\n\nPurpose of act.— This act provides for a proportionate allocation of the burden among tortfeasors who are liable.Rio Grande Gas Co. v. Stahmann Farms, Inc., 1969-NMSC-089, 80 N.M. 432, 457 P.2d 364.\n\nCommon-law right to indemnity.— The right to indemnity at common law in New Mexico was not abrogated by the enactment of this act.Thomas v. Malco Refineries, Inc., 214 F.2d 884 (10th Cir. 1954).\n\nWorkmen's Compensation Act.— The Workmen's Compensation Act [52-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.] (now Workers' Compensation Act) abrogates or modifies the Tortfeasor's Act [41-3-1 to 41-3-8 NMSA 1978] to the extent that it has application to the liability of an employer to an employee. If the basis for employer's liability is the injuries to its employees, it is limited by the Workmen's Compensation Act, and there can be no contribution.Beal ex rel. Boatwright v. Southern Union Gas Co., 1956-NMSC-113, 62 N.M. 38, 304 P.2d 566.\n\nInsofar as negligent employers are relieved from the burden of contribution, the Workmen's Compensation Act [52-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.] (now Workers' Compensation Act) does not constitute invalid class legislation.Beal ex rel. Boatwright v. Southern Union Gas Co., 1956-NMSC-113, 62 N.M. 38, 304 P.2d 566.\n\nWorkers' Compensation Act.— Contribution remedy outside the Workers' Compensation Act is not authorized by the Workers' Compensation Act.Tom Growney Equip. Co. v. Jouett, 2005-NMSC-015, 137 N.M. 497, 113 P.3d 320.\n\nEmployer's liability limitation under Workmen's Compensation Act.— The limitation of employer's liability for injuries sustained by an employee covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act [52-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.] (now Workers' Compensation Act) covers all instances where that injury is sought to be made the basis for further and additional liability by the employee or others in the worker's behalf, and indirect liability for such injury is also foreclosed both by the terms of the act and because the employer's liability for such injury is not in tort.Beal ex rel. Boatwright v. Southern Union Gas Co., 1956-NMSC-113, 62 N.M. 38, 304 P.2d 566.\n\nDefendants under different theories of liability not joint tortfeasors.— Where suits against a defendant and a third-party defendant are based on different theories of liability, there is no joint tort liability and the trial court properly refused to give a jury instruction as to contribution among joint tortfeasors.Exum v. Ferguson, 1981-NMSC-124, 97 N.M. 122, 637 P.2d 553.\n\nBecause the respondeat superior form of vicarious liability is imposed upon one party through a legal fiction, the parties are not joint tortfeasors.Kinetics, Inc. v. El Paso Prods. Co., 1982-NMCA-160, 99 N.M. 22, 653 P.2d 522.\n\nIn a comparative negligence case, a concurrent tortfeasor is not liable for the entire damage caused by other concurrent tortfeasors.Bartlett v. N.M. Welding Supply, Inc., 1982-NMCA-048, 98 N.M. 152, 646 P.2d 579, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794.\n\nEffect of setting aside part of verdict.— While it was the rule of the common law that a verdict set aside as to one joint tortfeasor was set aside as to all, the modern rule is that the court may grant a new trial as to one of several defendants and affirm as to the others.Beal v. Southern Union Gas Co., 1960-NMSC-019, 66 N.M. 424, 349 P.2d 337.\n\nEffect on release and discharge.— This act changed the common-law rule that a release of one joint tortfeasor releases all, and satisfaction of judgment under this act does not operate to discharge all other tortfeasors.Herrera v. Uhl, 1969-NMSC-01180 N.M. 140, 452 P.2d 474.\n\nEffect of granting judgment notwithstanding verdict solely to codefendant.— Where a codefendant was granted a judgment notwithstanding the special verdict of the jury, the defendant in an automobile damage suit was an aggrieved party within the meaning of the rule providing for appeals from entry of final judgment in civil actions in view of the right of contribution among joint tortfeasors under this act.Marr v. Nagel, 1954-NMSC-071, 58 N.M. 479, 272 P.2d 681.\n\nBank not indispensable party in suit against collection agency.— Debtor on automobile installment sales contract whose car was wrongfully repossessed is entitled to sue the collection agency separate and apart from the bank which authorized the repossession. The failure of jurisdiction over the bank as joint defendant does not compel the sustaining of the collection agency's motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of an indispensable party since the collection agency's right to contribution is preserved even in the absence of the bank as codefendant.Sanford v. Stoll, 1974-NMCA-003, 86 N.M. 6, 518 P.2d 1210.\n\nLiability of joint tortfeasor to bailee where bailor-agent negligent.— Where a pickup truck struck the rear end of a tractor-trailer unit on a highway at night, the driver of the pickup truck was liable to the trailer owner for damages to the trailer where drivers of both vehicles were joint tortfeasors under this section due to their combined negligence, and the driver of pickup truck did not carry the burden of showing that relationship between owner and driver of trailer was more than that of bailor-agent of bailee. The driver of the pickup truck should compensate the trailer owner for the damage to the trailer, subject to the right of contribution provided for in 41-3-2 NMSA 1978.Bailey v. Jeffries-Eaves, Inc., 1966-NMSC-067, 76 N.M. 278, 414 P.2d 503.\n\nNo interspousal tort immunity.— There is no immunity from tort liability between spouses by reason of that relationship.Maestas v. Overton, 1975-NMSC-004, 87 N.M. 213, 531 P.2d 947.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Comparative v. Contributory Negligence: The Effect of Plaintiff's Fault,\" see 6 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. The right of contribution exists among joint tortfeasors.\n\nB. A joint tortfeasor is not entitled to a money judgment for contribution until he has by payment discharged the common liability or has paid more than his pro rata share thereof.\n\nC. A joint tortfeasor who enters into a settlement with the injured person is not entitled to recover contribution from another joint tortfeasor whose liability to the injured person is not extinguished by the settlement.\n\nD. A pro rata share shall be the portion of the total dollar amount awarded as damages to the plaintiff that is equal to the ratio of each joint tortfeasor's percentage of fault to the total percentage of fault attributed to all joint tortfeasors.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 21-119, enacted by Laws 1947, ch. 121, § 2; 1953 Comp., § 24-1-12; 1987, ch. 141, § 3.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 1987, ch. 141 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 23, was effective June 19, 1987, 90 days after the adjournment of the legislature.\n\nCross references.— For right of indemnity not impaired,see41-3-6 NMSA 1978.\n\nPurpose of statute.— The purpose of this act (41-3-1 to 41-3-8 NMSA 1978) is to provide for a proportionate allocation of the burden among tortfeasors who are liable.Rio Grande Gas Co. v. Stahmann Farms, Inc., 1969-NMSC-089, 80 N.M. 432, 457 P.2d 364;Alder v. Garcia, 324 F.2d 483 (10th Cir. 1963).\n\nPurpose of section.— The purpose of this section is to prevent the injured person from relieving one joint tortfeasor of the obligation of contribution except where the injured person has also released the other tortfeasors from their pro rata share of the common liability.Garrison v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 1964-NMSC-099, 74 N.M. 238, 392 P.2d 580.\n\nDoctrine of contribution is deeply rooted in principles of equity,fair play and justice.Aalco Mfg. Co. v. City of Espanola, 1980-NMSC-088, 95 N.M. 66, 618 P.2d 1230;Dessauer v. Memorial Gen. Hosp., 1981-NMCA-051, 96 N.M. 92, 628 P.2d 337.\n\nLimited application.— The Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act [41-3-1 to 41-3-8 NMSA 1978] no longer has force in this state with respect to contribution among concurrent tortfeasors.Wilson v. Galt, 1983-NMCA-074, 100 N.M. 227, 668 P.2d 1104, cert. quashed, 100 N.M. 192, 668 P.2d 308.\n\nContribution not available to servant against innocent master under vicarious liability.— If the master may obtain indemnity from a servant, for whose tort the master has responded in damages, it is totally illogical to think the servant may claim a right to contribution or indemnity from the innocent master once the servant has paid liability to the injured plaintiff.Dessauer v. Memorial Gen. Hosp., 1981-NMCA-051, 96 N.M. 92, 628 P.2d 337.\n\nThe doctrine of vicarious liability was fashioned to provide a remedy to the innocent plaintiff, not to furnish a windfall to a solvent wrongdoer.Dessauer v. Memorial Gen. Hosp., 1981-NMCA-051, 96 N.M. 92, 628 P.2d 337.\n\nLiability of joint tortfeasor.— Where pickup truck struck rear end of tractor-trailer unit on highway at night, pickup truck driver was liable to the owner of the trailer for damages to the trailer where drivers of both vehicles were joint tortfeasors under 41-3-1 NMSA 1978 due to their combined negligence and the driver of pickup truck did not carry the burden of showing that relationship between owner and driver of the tractor-trailer unit was more than that of bailor-agent of bailee. The driver of the pickup truck should compensate the trailer owner for the damage to the trailer, subject to the right of contribution under this section.Bailey v. Jeffries-Eaves, Inc., 1966-NMSC-094, 76 N.M. 278, 414 P.2d 503.\n\nRecovery barred when tortfeasors in pari delicto.— One tortfeasor may not be indemnified by another when they are in pari delicto.Rio Grande Gas Co. v. Stahmann Farms, Inc., 1969-NMSC-089, 80 N.M. 432, 457 P.2d 364.\n\nIndemnity is allowed against the primary wrongdoer and not against a tortfeasor in pari delicto.Dessauer v. Memorial Gen. Hosp., 1981-NMCA-051, 96 N.M. 92, 628 P.2d 337.\n\nAssignment of future recovery void.— A person who was injured while moving hay elevator brought an action against the owner of the elevator for personal injuries. Owner's insurer settled the suit by paying plaintiff $40,000 for release of owner and assignment to insurer of one-half of any recovery or settlement, not to exceed $80,000, which plaintiff might later obtain in action against the manufacturer of the elevator. Plaintiff's action against manufacturer was settled by the manufacturer for $40,000. The insurer of the owner of the hay elevator could not enforce assignment against injured person and manufacturer as it was contrary to public policy as expressed in Subsection C and in 41-3-5 NMSA 1978.Alder v. Garcia, 324 F.2d 483 (10th Cir. 1963).\n\nNo interspousal tort immunity.— There is no immunity from tort liability between spouses by reason of that relationship.Maestas v. Overton, 1975-NMSC-004, 87 N.M. 213, 531 P.2d 947.\n\nEffect of family relationship on contribution.— The right of contribution is denied if the plaintiff, because of a marital, filial or other family relationship between the injured person and the person against whom contribution is sought, did not have an enforceable right against the latter.Fitzgerald v. Valdez, 1967-NMSC-088, 77 N.M. 769, 427 P.2d 655.\n\nSettlement with one tortfeasor.— In personal injury action arising from gas explosion, gas company's settlement with injured party and resulting release did not operate to release landowner since landowner was not notified of settlement and release did not purport to release any other claims of injured party; therefore, gas company was not entitled to contribution by landowner.Rio Grande Gas Co. v. Stahmann Farms, Inc., 1969-NMSC-089, 80 N.M. 432, 457 P.2d 364.\n\nWhere joint tortfeasor's potential liability to injured plaintiff is not legally extinguished by settlement proceedings, settling joint tortfeasor cannot claim contribution.United States v. Reilly, 385 F.2d 225 (10th Cir. 1967).\n\nRelease must be by name.— A joint tortfeasor must be released by name in order for the settling joint tortfeasor to recover contribution, and this notwithstanding language in the settlement or order of approval purporting to satisfy \"all claims\" arising out of the incident.United States v. Reilly, 385 F.2d 225 (10th Cir. 1967).\n\nNo right of contribution where verdict rendered on single defendant's liability.— No right of offset or contribution can arise with respect to a verdict rendered on the basis of one defendant's liability only.Kirby v. N.M. State Hwy. Dep't, 1982-NMCA-014, 97 N.M. 692, 643 P.2d 256, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 51, 644 P.2d 1040.\n\nIndemnity not abrogated.— The right to indemnity at common law in New Mexico was not abrogated by the enactment of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act [41-3-1 to 41-3-8 NMSA 1978].Thomas v. Malco Refineries, Inc., 214 F.2d 884 (10th Cir. 1954).\n\nIndemnity not impaired.— Section 41-3-6 NMSA 1978 does not impair any right of indemnity under existing law.Morris v. Uhl & Lopez Eng'rs, Inc., 442 F.2d 1247 (10th Cir. 1971).\n\nRight of contribution among joint § 1983 defendants is federal common-law issue.— Where the plaintiff's cause of action is solely for violation of civil rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the question of whether a right of contribution exists among joint § 1983 defendants is one of federal common law, not one governed by reference to the law of the forum state.Valdez v. City of Farmington, 580 F. Supp. 19 (D.N.M. 1984).\n\nRights of indemnity and contribution distinguished.— Although the state recognizes common-law right of indemnity in favor of a tortfeasor who has been guilty of only passive or secondary negligence against another who has been guilty of active or primary negligence, such right of indemnity is to be distinguished from right to contribution under this act.Morris v. Uhl & Lopez Eng'rs, Inc., 442 F.2d 1247 (10th Cir. 1971).\n\nThe difference between indemnity and contribution is that with indemnity the right enforces a duty on the primary wrongdoer to respond for all damages; while with contribution, an obligation is imposed by law upon one joint tortfeasor to contribute that tortfeasor's share to the discharge of the common liability.Dessauer v. Memorial Gen. Hosp., 1981-NMCA-051, 96 N.M. 92, 628 P.2d 337.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Judicial Adoption of Comparative Fault in New Mexico: The Time Is at Hand,\" see 10 N.M.L.

Galt, 1983-NMCA-074, 100 N.M. 227, 668 P.2d 1104, cert. quashed, 100 N.M. 192, 668 P.2d 308.\n\nEffect of appeal on subsequent action.— Where a judgment was rendered against a different defendant which was not satisfied or settled, and was pending on appeal, it could not be urged as satisfaction of any claims of plaintiff against another defendant, nor bar further action by plaintiff against another defendant.Montano v. Williams, 1976-NMCA-017, 89 N.M. 86, 547 P.2d 569,aff'd, 1976-NMSC-022, 89 N.M. 252, 550 P.2d 264.\n\nDismissal of contribution suit.— Where gas company, being sued for injuries sustained in explosion by plaintiffs working on junction box beneath a street intersection, filed third-party complaint against city, alleging that the city knew of the dangerous condition but failed to notify the gas company, and seeking contribution under this act, an error in dismissing the third-party complaint would not affect plaintiffs' verdicts against the gas company.Beal v. Southern Union Gas Co., 1960-NMSC-019, 66 N.M. 424, 349 P.2d 337, 84 A.L.R.2d 1269 (1960).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —47 Am. Jur. 2d Judgments § 685; 74 Am.

      "heading": "Release; effect on injured person's claim.",
      "text": "A release by the injured person of one joint tortfeasor, whether before or after judgment, does not discharge the other tortfeasors unless the release so provides; but reduces the claim against the other tortfeasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release, or in any amount or proportion by which the release provides that the total claim shall be reduced, if greater than the consideration paid.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 21-121, enacted by Laws 1947, ch. 121, § 4; 1953 Comp., § 24-1-14.\n\n\"Claim\" and \"damages recoverable\".— The legislature appears to have interpreted the terms \"claim\" and \"damages recoverable\" synonymously. In this section, the release, under certain circumstances, has the effect of reducing the \"claim\" of the injured person against other tortfeasors, while in 41-3-5 NMSA 1978 the same right is spoken of as \"damages recoverable.\"Garrison v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 1964-NMSC-099, 74 N.M. 238, 392 P.2d 580.\n\nRelease of joint tortfeasors.— A release of liability executed in favor of one defendant does not operate to extinguish liability of the joint tortfeasors unless the release so provides. Rather, the release only operates to reduce the amount of damages for which the remaining defendants are responsible.Martinez v. Albuquerque Collection Servs., Inc., 867 F. Supp. 1495 (D.N.M. 1994).\n\nThe effect of the release of one joint tortfeasor upon the injured person's claim against remaining tortfeasors is to reduce it in an amount at least as great as the consideration paid for the release, and to a larger amount if the release so provides. This provision prevents a double recovery by the injured person.Garrison v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 1964-NMSC-099, 74 N.M. 238, 392 P.2d 580.\n\nReleases are contractual in nature,thus, the question of whether the general release clause contained in the plaintiff's release of the defendants discharging \"every other person, firm, or corporation\" is binding upon the plaintiff must be determined in accordance with contract principles. Absent an ambiguity or other reasons which might invalidate the contract, such as fraud, duress, or undue influence, the parties to a release are free to discharge not only the settling tortfeasor but all other unnamed tortfeasors as third party beneficiaries to the release.Perea v. Snyder, 1994-NMCA-064, 117 N.M. 774, 877 P.2d 580, cert. denied, 118 N.M. 90, 879 P.2d 91.\n\nRelease effective whether or not person adjudged tortfeasor.— Whether or not one who settles and receives a release is judicially determined to be a tortfeasor or clearly admits being one, absent any other countervailing consideration, the release reduces the claim against the other tortfeasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release or in such amount or proportion as the release provides for reduction, if the total claim is greater than the consideration paid.Kirby v. N.M. State Hwy. Dep't, 1982-NMCA-014, 97 N.M. 692, 643 P.2d 256, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 51, 644 P.2d 1040.\n\nEffect of release under 41-3-5 NMSA 1978.— Where release is taken pursuant to 41-3-5 NMSA 1978, the release of one joint tortfeasor does not release all joint tortfeasors.Garrison v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 1964-NMSC-099, 74 N.M. 238, 392 P.2d 580.\n\nEffect of recovery alone on discharge of others.— The fact of the recovery of a judgment by the injured persons against one tortfeasor alone does not operate as a discharge of other joint tortfeasors.Rio Grande Gas Co. v. Stahmann Farms, Inc., 1969-NMSC-089, 80 N.M. 432, 457 P.2d 364;Herrera v. Uhl, 1969-NMSC-011, 80 N.M. 140, 452 P.2d 474.\n\nWhen joint tortfeasor also released.— A release executed by the plaintiff to a motorist whose vehicle was involved in an accident with one operated by a city police officer in which plaintiff was a prisoner discharged the city from any liability because the release provided for the extinguishment of any liability sought to be asserted by the plaintiff.Johnson v. City of Las Cruces, 1974-NMCA-031, 86 N.M. 196, 521 P.2d 1037.\n\nPlaintiff's burden of proof following execution of release when suing different defendants.— Following the plaintiff's execution of a release of judgment, the plaintiffs sought under a different theory of recovery and against different defendants the same damages as evidenced by the release. Since an award for punitive damages must be supported by an established cause of action, the plaintiffs may recover any unpaid compensatory and punitive damages if they can successfully establish a cause of action for either nominal or compensatory damages.Sanchez v. Clayton, 1994-NMSC-064, 117 N.M. 761, 877 P.2d 567.\n\nCollateral source rule.— The collateral source rule presents an exception to the general prohibition of double recovery, permitting a plaintiff to recover the same damages from both a defendant and a collateral source; compensation received from a collateral source does not operate to reduce damages recoverable from a wrongdoer.Gonzagowski v. Steamatic of Albuquerque, 2023-NMSC-016,rev'g in part2021-NMCA-056.\n\nThe collateral source rule has no application to a postjudgment payment made by an adjudicated wrongdoer.— Where plaintiff's home sustained water damage in a hailstorm, and where plaintiff's insurer hired a restoration service to perform water abatement and mold remediation services, and where plaintiff claimed that the mold was not remediated properly and that he developed a severe and permanent lung condition as a result, and where, in a civil trial, the jury found that plaintiff suffered $2.5 million in compensatory damages, that plaintiff's insurer caused 30% of the damages, that the restoration service caused 55% of the damages and that plaintiff's failure to mitigate caused 15% of his damages, and where the district court entered final judgment accordingly, and where, after entry of judgment, plaintiff's insurer settled with plaintiff and secured full satisfaction and release from judgment, and where, shortly after this postjudgment settlement, plaintiff moved to amend the final judgment as only against the restoration service, claiming that the remaining defendant was liable for 80% of plaintiff's compensatory damages, and where the district court entered an amended judgment setting aside the prior final judgment and holding that the restoration service was liable to plaintiff for $2,000,000 in compensatory damages and was not entitled to an offset of the amount of damages allocated to plaintiff's insurer, the district court erred in its amended final judgment, because the 80% share of damages allocated to defendant partially duplicated the 30% share allocated to plaintiff's insurer in the initial final judgment and an offset was necessary due to plaintiff's insurer's satisfaction of the same damages. In a postjudgment settlement with an adjudicated wrongdoer, that payor is not a collateral source, and therefore plaintiff is not permitted to recover the duplicative portion of both defendants' combined liability damages.Gonzagowski v. Steamatic of Albuquerque, 2023-NMSC-016,rev'g in part2021-NMCA-056.\n\nDouble recovery for injuries received is not permissible.— Where plaintiff filed a complaint that included a breach of contract claim against his insurance company for failing to adequately remediate his home and a negligence claim against defendant for improperly performing water mitigation and mold remediation work following a hailstorm that caused interior damage to plaintiff's home, which resulted in severe and permanent lung damage to plaintiff from inhaling mold and mold spores, and where at trial the jury awarded a total of $2.5 million in compensatory damages, finding the insurance company thirty percent at fault, defendant fifty-five percent at fault, and plaintiff fifteen percent at fault for failing to exercise ordinary care to minimize, or lessen, his damages, and where, after settling with the insurance company, plaintiff filed a motion to amend the judgment against defendant from $1.375 million to $2 million, arguing that it was error to compare the insurance company's breach of contract to defendant's negligence for purposes of apportioning liability for damages, and that judgment should be entered against defendant for the full compensatory damage award on the negligence claim, and where the district court, after granting plaintiff's motion and entering an amended final judgment against defendant in the amount of $2 million, denied defendant's motion to reduce the amended judgment by the amount of the judgment against the insurance company, the district court erred in denying defendant's motion to reduce the amended judgment by the amount plaintiff received from the insurance company, because to the extent the insurance company satisfied a portion of the compensatory damages judgment, that satisfaction has the effect of a discharge and reduces the amount plaintiff is entitled to collect from defendant.Gonzagowski v. Steamatic of Albuquerque, Inc., 2021-NMCA-056, 497 P.3d 1202,rev'd in part by2023-NMSC-016.\n\nRelease acknowledging full satisfaction of judgment.— Payment by a tortfeasor of $200,000 in return for an instrument which acknowledged \"full satisfaction of the judgment\" against that tortfeasor was a full satisfaction of the compensatory damages for the injury, thereby precluding an action by plaintiff against the tortfeasor's principal for compensatory damages for the same injury, since the consideration paid by one tortfeasor for a release represents full compensation for the injury, the other tortfeasor is discharged.Sierra Blanca Sales Co. v. Newco Indus., Inc., 1975-NMCA-118, 88 N.M. 472, 542 P.2d 52,rev'dsub nom., Fortuna Corp. v. Sierra Blanca Sales Co., 1976-NMSC-014, 89 N.M. 187, 548 P.2d 865.\n\nPayment in full not required.— Although a judgment may only be satisfied by payment in full, payment in full is not required where there is a lawful agreement discharging the judgment, the essence of which is consideration, and where plaintiff accepted a lesser amount than that to which it was entitled by the judgment in order to obtain immediate cash, being unable to secure funds in order to levy on defendant's stock on which he had a lien, the court of appeals held that there was a lawful agreement discharging the judgment, plaintiff was compensated for the injury in full and the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment to his principal on the issue of compensatory damages.Sierra Blanca Sales Co. v. Newco Indus., Inc., 1975-NMCA-118, 88 N.M. 472, 542 P.2d 52,rev'dsub nom., Fortuna Corp. v. Sierra Blanca Sales Co., 1976-NMSC-014, 89 N.M. 187, 548 P.2d 865\n\nRelease must be read as a wholeand the intent of the parties gathered from the entire instrument and not from separate portions.Garrison v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 1964-NMSC-099,74 N.M. 238, 392 P.2d 580.\n\nThere is no right to reduction of jury awardbased on out-of-court settlements when the case is tried on a theory of comparative fault.Atler v. Murphy Enters., Inc., 2005-NMCA-006, 136 N.M. 701, 104 P.3d 1092, cert. quashed, 2005-NMCERT-008, 138 N.M. 330, 119 P.3d 126.\n\nRelease is ambiguous if it is fairly susceptible to more than one meaning.Collins v. United States, 708 F.2d 499 (10th Cir. 1983).\n\nEffect of release as to punitive damages.— Since punitive damages are not awarded as compensation to the party wronged, but rather as punishment of the offender, and as a warning to others, plaintiff ought not be limited to one amount of punitive recovery, and therefore the release of one tortfeasor as to the punitive aspect of the damages would logically have no effect on plaintiff's rights against another tortfeasor for such damages.Sierra Blanca Sales Co. v. Newco Indus., Inc., 1975-NMCA-118, 88 N.M. 472, 542 P.2d 52,rev'dsub nom., Fortuna Corp. v. Sierra Blanca Sales Co., 1976-NMSC-014, 89 N.M. 187, 548 P.2d 865\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Tort Law - Original and Successive Tortfeasors and Release Documents in New Mexico Tort Law: Lujan v.

      "text": "A release by the injured person of one joint tortfeasor does not relieve him from liability to make contribution to another joint tortfeasor unless the release is given before the right of the other tortfeasor to secure a money judgment for contribution has accrued, and provides for a reduction, to the extent of the pro rata share of the released tortfeasor, of the injured person's damages recoverable against all the other tortfeasors.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 21-122, enacted by Laws 1947, ch. 121, § 5; 1953 Comp., § 24-1-15.\n\n\"Claim\" and \"damages recoverable\".— The legislature appears to have interpreted the terms \"claim\" and \"damages recoverable\" synonymously. In 41-3-4 NMSA 1978 the release, under certain circumstances, has the effect of reducing the \"claim\" of the injured person against other tortfeasors, while in this section the same right is spoken of as \"damages recoverable.\"Garrison v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 1964-NMSC-099,74 N.M. 238, 392 P.2d 580.\n\nPurpose of act.— One of the purposes of this act [41-3-1 to 41-3-8 NMSA 1978] is to provide for a proportionate allocation of the burden among tortfeasors who are liable.Rio Grande Gas Co. v. Stahmann Farms, Inc., 1969-NMSC-089, 80 N.M. 432, 457 P.2d 364.\n\nLimited applicability of article.— The Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act [41-3-1 to 41-3-8 NMSA 1978] no longer has force in this state with respect to contribution among concurrent tortfeasors.Wilson v. Galt, 1983-NMCA-074, 100 N.M. 227, 668 P.2d 1104, cert. quashed, 100 N.M. 192, 668 P.2d 308.\n\nLimiting release to pro rata share.— Where release provided for reduction of plaintiff's claims for damage to extent of pro rata share of liability of released tortfeasors, it sufficiently complied with this section which establishes conditions under which an injured person's release relieves the joint tortfeasor from liability for contribution.Garrison v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 1964-NMSC-099,74 N.M. 238, 392 P.2d 580.\n\nWhere settling tortfeasor denied contribution.— Where the language of the release made it clear that the settlement between one tortfeasor and the plaintiffs was for that tortfeasor's benefit alone, and that tortfeasor settled its liability to the plaintiffs, separate and distinct from any liability of second tortfeasor to the plaintiffs, and without attempting to gain any benefit for second tortfeasor, the first tortfeasor was not entitled to contribution from the second.Rio Grande Gas Co. v. Stahmann Farms, Inc., 1969-NMSC-089, 80 N.M. 432, 457 P.2d 364.\n\nRights of nonsettling joint tortfeasor.— The right of a nonsettling joint tortfeasor to collect contribution from the one released is protected unless the release provides for a reduction to the extent mentioned in 41-3-4 NMSA 1978 of the damages recoverable from the remaining tortfeasors.Garrison v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 1964-NMSC-099,74 N.M. 238, 392 P.2d 580.\n\nAll joint tortfeasors not released.— Where release was taken under this section the release of one joint tortfeasor did not release all joint tortfeasors.Garrison v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 1964-NMSC-099,74 N.M. 238, 392 P.2d 580.\n\nSettlement for full damages not bar to suit of other joint tortfeasor.— Where an injured person settles with one tortfeasor for an amount equal to or in excess of the amount of damages, the injured person may pursue recovery from each severally liable tortfeasor without reduction.Wilson v. Galt, 1983-NMCA-074, 100 N.M. 227, 668 P.2d 1104, cert. quashed, 100 N.M. 192, 668 P.2d 308.\n\nAssignment of future recovery void.— A person injured while moving hay elevator sued owner of elevator for personal injuries. Owner's insurer settled suit by paying plaintiff $40,000 for release of owner and assignment to insurer of one-half of any recovery or settlement, not to exceed $80,000, which plaintiff might later obtain in action against the manufacturer of the elevator. Plaintiff's action against manufacturer was settled by the manufacturer for $40,000. The insurer of the owner of the hay elevator could not enforce assignment against injured person and manufacturer as it was contrary to public policy as expressed in 41-3-2, Subsection C NMSA 1978 and this section.Alder v. Garcia, 324 F.2d 483 (10th Cir. 1963).\n\nJoint tortfeasor must be released by namein order for the settling joint tortfeasor to recover contribution, and this notwithstanding language in the settlement or order of approval purporting to satisfy \"all claims\" arising out of the incident.United States v. Reilly, 385 F.2d 225 (10th Cir. 1967).\n\nRelease must be read as a wholeand the intent of the parties gathered from the entire instrument, not from separate portions.Garrison v.

      "text": "This act [41-3-1 to 41-3-8 NMSA 1978] does not impair any right of indemnity under existing law.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 21-123, enacted by Laws 1947, ch. 121, § 6; 1953 Comp., § 24-1-16.\n\nCross references.— For indemnity agreements, when void,see56-7-1, 56-7-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nIndemnity not abrogated.— The right to indemnity at common law in New Mexico was not abrogated by the enactment of this act.Thomas v. Malco Refineries, Inc., 214 F.2d 884 (10th Cir. 1954).\n\nIndemnity between primary and secondary wrongdoers.— New Mexico recognizes a common-law right of indemnity in favor of a tortfeasor who has been guilty of only passive or secondary negligence against another who has been guilty of active or primary negligence.Morris v. Uhl & Lopez Eng'rs, Inc., 442 F.2d 1247 (10th Cir. 1971).\n\nA secondary or passive wrongdoer who has paid damages to an injured party has a common-law right of indemnity against the primary or active wrongdoer.United States v. Reilly, 385 F.2d 225 (10th Cir. 1967).\n\nIndemnity when tortfeasors in pari delicto.— One tortfeasor may not recover indemnity from another when they are in pari delicto.Morris v. Uhl & Lopez Eng'rs, Inc., 442 F.2d 1247 (10th Cir. 1971);Dessauer v. Memorial Gen. Hosp., 1981-NMCA-051, 96 N.M. 92, 628 P.2d 337.\n\nIf joint tortfeasors are not in pari delicto,or in equal fault, the secondary or passive wrongdoer may put the ultimate loss upon the one principally responsible for the injury.United States v. Reilly, 385 F.2d 225 (10th Cir. 1967).\n\nIndemnity and contribution contrasted.— The difference between indemnity and contribution in cases between persons liable for an injury to another is that, with indemnity, the right to recover springs from a contract, express or implied, and enforces a duty on the primary wrongdoer to respond for all damages; with contribution, an obligation is imposed by law upon one joint tortfeasor to contribute that tortfeasor's share to the discharge of the common liability.Rio Grande Gas Co. v. Stahmann Farms, Inc., 1969-NMSC-089, 80 N.M. 432, 457 P.2d 364;Dessauer v. Memorial Gen. Hosp., 1981-NMCA-051, 96 N.M. 92, 628 P.2d 337.\n\nIndemnity springs from a contract, express or implied, and enforces a duty on the primary or principal wrongdoer to respond for all the damages. Contribution does not arise out of contract, but is an obligation imposed by law, and rests on the principle that, when the parties stand in aequali jure, the law requires equality, which is equity, and that all should contribute equally to the discharge of the common liability.Thomas v. Malco Refineries, Inc., 214 F.2d 884 (10th Cir. 1954).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —18 Am.
