      "text": "Chapter 41, Article 5 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Medical Malpractice Act\".\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 58-33-1, enacted by Laws 1976, ch. 2, § 1; 1992, ch. 33, § 1.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective April 1, 1992, substituted \"Chapter 41, Article 5 NMSA\" for \"This act\".\n\nApplicability.— Laws 1992, ch. 33, § 17 made the provisions of the act applicable only to occurrences arising on and after April 1, 1994.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 1992, ch. 33, § 15, effective March 6, 1992, provided that for the purposes of the Medical Malpractice Act, a health care provider who qualified for medical malpractice liability insurance pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Malpractice Act in effect prior to April 1, 1992 shall remain subject to the terms and provisions of the act that existed on the date of qualification and further provided that upon the date of renewal for a health care provider's policy of medical malpractice liability insurance or the date of continuation of coverage for health care providers who maintain a cash deposit with the superintendent of insurance, the provisions of the Medical Malpractice Act in effect on the dates of renewal or continuation shall apply.\n\nPurpose of act.— This act's limitation of health care provider liability reflects a concern by the legislature for the health of New Mexico citizens as affected by the availability of physicians and malpractice coverage.Lester ex rel. Mavrogenis v. Hall, 1998-NMSC-047, 126 N.M. 404, 970 P.2d 590.\n\nScope.— The Medical Malpractice Act [Chapter 41, Article 5 NMSA 1978] covers all causes of action arising in New Mexico that are based on acts of malpractice.Wilschinsky v. Medina, 1989-NMSC-047, 108 N.M. 511, 775 P.2d 713.\n\nMedical Malpractice Act held constitutional.Otero v. Zouhar, 1984-NMCA-054, 102 N.M. 493, 697 P.2d 493,rev'd in part on other grounds, 1985-NMSC-021, 102 N.M. 482, 697 P.2d 482.\n\nMalpractice claims under this article do not include claims of criminal sexual assaultnot committed in the course of rendering professional health care services.N.M. Physicians Mut. Liab. Co. v. LaMure, 1993-NMSC-048, 116 N.M. 92, 860 P.2d 734.\n\nClaim held within scope of act.— Third party's malpractice claim, resulting from injuries caused by a patient's impaired ability to drive after a doctor administered powerful drugs to the patient in the doctor's office, fell within the purpose of the Medical Malpractice Act [Chapter 41, Article 5 NMSA 1978].Wilschinsky v. Medina, 1989-NMSC-047, 108 N.M. 511, 775 P.2d 713.\n\nProof of medical malpractice.— To prove medical malpractice, a plaintiff must show that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty recognized by law, the defendant breached the duty by departing from the proper standard of medical practice recognized in the community, and the acts or omissions complained of proximately caused the plaintiff's injuries.Brown v. Kellogg, 2015-NMCA-006, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nDuty considerations.— Courts must articulate specific policy reasons when deciding whether a defendant does or does not have a duty or that an existing duty should be limited; foreseeability is not a factor for courts to consider when determining the existence of a duty because it is a fact-intensive inquiry relevant only to breach of duty and legal cause considerations.Brown v. Kellogg, 2015-NMCA-006, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nSources of duty for medical professionals.— A duty can be found where a medical professional exerts control over a patient with known dangerous propensities who causes injury, where a medical professional is aware of specific threats to the life of an individual and fails to disclose those threats, and where a medical professional administers powerful drugs that results in impairment to a patient who then causes injury to others.Brown v. Kellogg, 2015-NMCA-006, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nWhere duty on medical professionals not found.— Where police detective, after being examined by healthcare professionals for depression and suicidal thoughts and after being discharged with a follow-up plan for therapy, proceeded to use his service weapon to shoot his wife and kill himself, the court of appeals declined to impose a duty to order a fitness for duty evaluation on independent healthcare professionals who treat individuals with access to firearms as part of their workplace environment, because it did not fall within one of the three recognized sources of duty for medical professionals to third parties.Brown v. Kellogg, 2015-NMCA-006, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-010.\n\nRepresentation required in malpractice action.— A non-attorney parent was required to be represented by counsel in order to bring a medical malpractice claim on behalf of his minor son.Chisholm v. Rueckhaus, 1997-NMCA-112, 124 N.M. 255, 948 P.2d 707, cert. denied, 124 N.M. 268, 949 P.2d 282.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Medical Malpractice Legislation in New Mexico,\" see 7 N.M.L.

and in Subsection L, after \"superintendent of insurance\", deleted \"of this state\".\n\nCommunication between medical personnel.— Communication between medical personnel is not a matter that requires expert knowledge to understand the standard of care involved and a party may be able to establish that a departure from the standard of ordinary care occurs when a clerical error affects the timeliness or accuracy of a diagnosis.Zamora v. St. Vincent Hospital, 2014-NMSC-035.\n\nWhere plaintiff was admitted to defendant's emergency room with abdominal pain; a contract radiologist performed an abdominal scan on plaintiff; the radiology report concluded that defendant had a diverticular abscess and that cancer was a possibility; the emergency physician and surgeon never received the radiologist's report; plaintiff was diagnosed with colon cancer fourteen months later; plaintiff sued defendant alleging that as a consequence of defendant's failure through an administrative inadequacy to forward the radiology report to the surgeon, plaintiff was treated for a diverticular abscess, allowing the cancer to grow; and defendant claimed that plaintiff failed to present expert testimony regarding the standard of care of communication between medical personnel, expert testimony was not required to establish the standard of care because the communication of the diagnosis by one doctor to another is subject to an ordinary negligence standard of care, which does not require expert testimony.Zamora v. St. Vincent Hospital, 2014-NMSC-035.\n\nMalpractice claim.— The controlling inquiry in determining whether a claim constitutes a \"malpractice claim\" under the Medical Malpractice Act [Chapter 41, Article 5 NMSA 1978] is whether the gravamen of the claim is predicated upon the allegation of professional negligence.Christus St. Vincent Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. Duarte-Afara, 2011-NMCA-112.\n\nClaim for equitable indemnification was a malpractice claim.— Where a patient sued a medical center and a doctor who practiced at the medical center for malpractice and the medical center sued the doctor for equitable indemnification based upon the claim that the doctor negligently caused and was partially liable for the patient's injuries, the equitable indemnification claim was a malpractice claim as that term is used in the Medical Malpractice Act [Chapter 41, Article 5 NMSA 1978].Christus St. Vincent Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. Duarte-Afara, 2011-NMCA-112.\n\nDefendants other than physicians.— This section's broad definition of health care provider is evidence that the legislature intended to impose liability beyond the context of the physician-patient relationship. When an individual is obliged as a condition of future or continued employment to submit to a medical examination, that examination creates a duty between the examining health care provider and the examinee.Baer v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 1994-NMCA-124, 118 N.M. 685, 884 P.2d 841.\n\nNegligent misrepresentation and intentional infliction of emotional distress not \"malpractice claim(s)\".— Claims for negligent misrepresentation and intentional infliction of emotional distress do not first have to be presented to the medical review commission because they do not come within the definition of a malpractice claim.Trujillo v. Puro, 1984-NMCA-050, 101 N.M. 408, 683 P.2d 963, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 362, 683 P.2d 44.\n\nMalpractice required.— The New Mexico Medical Malpractice Act covers injuries arising out of negligence and does not cover claims not based on acts of malpractice.Cordray v. Cnty. of Lincoln, 320 F.Supp.2d 1171 (D.N.M. 2004).\n\nFunctional test to distinguish medical or professional negligence from ordinary negligence.— If an act involves the use of special knowledge or skill to make a judgment call as to the appropriate thing to do or not to do, then the act is of a professional nature and claims based on the act must be brought and pursued as a medical or professional negligence action and requires expert testimony to assess the resultant act or failure to act. If not, the act is not of a professional nature and expert testimony is not required.Richter v. Presbyterian Healthcare Servs., 2014-NMCA-056, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-005.\n\nTimeliness of delivery of laboratory reports.— Expert testimony is required where a plaintiff's claims address the timeliness or urgency of the delivery system of laboratory reports, including any timeliness claims that involve the efficiency and design of the delivery system, except when the required timing is set by a known standard such as an internal policy, contract or governmental regulation.Richter v. Presbyterian Healthcare Servs., 2014-NMCA-056, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-005.\n\nMaintenance of hospital charts.— Hospitals have a clearly established duty to maintain their patient's medical charts in good order, including the duty to post completed lab tests as received. Assessing a hospital's compliance with its charting duties does not require expert testimony.Richter v. Presbyterian Healthcare Servs., 2014-NMCA-056, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-005.\n\nOrdinary negligence in delivering laboratory reports.— Where decedent died when decedent developed a heart arrhythmia during surgery in 2005; the heart arrhythmia was caused by an undiagnosed condition called pheochromocytoma; in 2001, the decedent's physicians ordered lab tests that were diagnostic of pheochromocytoma; the lab results were never read or acted upon by the physicians; plaintiff sued the hospital and the laboratory for negligent delivery of the lab results in 2001; plaintiff did not raise any matters involving urgency; and plaintiff showed that the laboratory had a routine procedure for delivering lab report to physicians, plaintiff's claims against the hospital and the laboratory could be pursued as ordinary negligence claims and did not require expert testimony.Richter v. Presbyterian Healthcare Servs., 2014-NMCA-056, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-005.\n\nOpinion of treating physician as to negligence of another treating physician.— Where decedent died when decedent developed a heart arrhythmia during surgery in 2005; the heart arrhythmia was caused by an undiagnosed condition called pheochromocytoma; prior to surgery, decedent's consulting surgeon ordered lab tests that would have disclosed the pheochromocytoma; the consulting surgeon scheduled surgery to be conducted by the operating surgeon; the operating surgeon conducted the surgery before the lab results had been received and despite decedent's high potassium levels that posed a chance of death during surgery; and plaintiff sought to elicit opinions from the consulting surgeon as to which acts of the operating surgeon were negligent; the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the consulting surgeon's opinions as to the operating surgeon's negligence.Richter v. Presbyterian Healthcare Servs., 2014-NMCA-056, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-005.\n\nFailure to present expert testimony on the standard of medical care.— Where decedent died when decedent developed a heart arrhythmia during surgery in 2005; the heart arrhythmia was caused by an undiagnosed condition called pheochromocytoma; prior to surgery, lab tests had been ordered that would have disclosed the pheochromocytoma; the surgeon conducted the surgery before the lab results had been received and despite decedent's high potassium levels that posed a chance of death during surgery; to establish the standard of care for the surgeon's conduct, plaintiff offered the testimony of an interventional radiology expert who testified that there was no standard practice that an interventional radiologist would use to address the complication that occurred in decedent's surgery; and plaintiff called a general surgeon to establish the standard of care applicable to decedent's surgery, but failed to lay a foundation for the general surgeon's opinion, plaintiff failed to present expert testimony on the standard of care and the district court did not err in directing a verdict in favor of the surgeon.Richter v. Presbyterian Healthcare Servs., 2014-NMCA-056, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-005.\n\nComparative negligence of non-parties.— Where decedent died when decedent developed a heart arrhythmia during surgery in 2005; the heart arrhythmia was caused by an undiagnosed condition called pheochromocytoma; in 2001, the decedent's physicians ordered lab tests that were diagnostic of pheochromocytoma; the lab results were never read or acted upon by the physicians; in 2005, prior to surgery, lab tests had been ordered that would have disclosed the pheochromocytoma; the surgeon conducted the surgery before the lab results had been received; and the district court permitted the jury to compare the alleged negligence of the decedent's 2001 physicians, who were non-parties in the case, with the negligence of the decedent's 2005 surgeons, comparative negligence principles required the district court to consider the comparative negligence of the non-party 2001 physicians.Richter v. Presbyterian Healthcare Servs., 2014-NMCA-056, cert. denied, 2014-NMCERT-005.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Medical Malpractice Legislation in New Mexico,\" see 7 N.M.L.

To be qualified under the provisions of the Medical Malpractice Act, a health care provider, except an independent outpatient health care facility, shall:\n\n(1) establish its financial responsibility by filing proof with the superintendent that the health care provider is insured by a policy of malpractice liability insurance issued by an authorized insurer in the amount of at least two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) per occurrence or by having continuously on deposit the sum of seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000) in cash with the superintendent or such other like deposit as the superintendent may allow by rule; provided that hospitals and hospital-controlled outpatient health care facilities that establish financial responsibility through a policy of malpractice liability insurance may use any form of malpractice insurance; and provided further that for independent providers, in the absence of an additional deposit or policy as required by this subsection, the deposit or policy shall provide coverage for not more than three separate occurrences; and\n\n(2) pay the surcharge assessed on health care providers by the superintendent pursuant to Section 41-5-25 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. To be qualified under the provisions of the Medical Malpractice Act, an independent outpatient health care facility shall:\n\n(1) establish its financial responsibility by filing proof with the superintendent that the health care provider is insured by a policy of malpractice liability insurance issued by an authorized insurer in the amount of at least five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) per occurrence or by having continuously on deposit the sum of one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000) in cash with the superintendent or other like deposit as the superintendent may allow by rule; provided that for independent outpatient health care facilities, in the absence of an additional deposit or policy as required by this subsection, the deposit or policy shall provide coverage for not more than three separate occurrences; and\n\n(2) pay the surcharge assessed on independent outpatient health care facilities by the superintendent pursuant to Section 41-5-25 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. For hospitals or hospital-controlled outpatient health care facilities electing to be covered under the Medical Malpractice Act, the superintendent shall determine, based on a risk assessment of each hospital or hospital-controlled outpatient health care facility, each hospital's or hospital-controlled outpatient health care facility's base coverage or deposit and additional charges for the fund. The superintendent shall arrange for an actuarial study before determining base coverage or deposit and surcharges.\n\nD. A health care provider not qualifying under this section shall not have the benefit of any of the provisions of the Medical Malpractice Act in the event of a malpractice claim against it; provided that beginning July 1, 2021, hospitals and hospital-controlled outpatient health care facilities shall not participate in the medical review process, and beginning January 1, 2027, hospitals and hospital-controlled outpatient health care facilities shall have the benefits of the other provisions of the Medical Malpractice Act except participation in the fund.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 41-5-5, enacted by Laws 1992, ch. 33, § 2; 2021, ch. 16, § 2; 2023, ch. 207, § 2.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1991, ch. 264, § 2 repealed former 41-5-5 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1991, ch. 264, § 1, and enacted a new 41-5-5 NMSA 1978, effective July 1, 1992.\n\nLaws 1992, ch. 33, § 2 repealed former 41-5-5 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1991, ch. 264, § 1, and as enacted by Laws 1991, ch. 264, § 2, and enacted a new section, effective April 1, 1992.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, provided separate qualification provisions for independent outpatient health care facilities; in Subsection A, in the introductory clause, after \"health care provider\", added \"except an independent outpatient health care facility\"; in Paragraph A(1), after \"provided that hospitals and\", added \"hospital-controlled\"; added a new Subsection B; redesignated former Subsections B and C as Subsections C and D, respectively; in Subsection C, added \"hospital-controlled\" preceding each occurrence of \"outpatient health care facility\" and \"outpatient health care facilities\"; and in Subsection D, added \"hospital-controlled\" preceding each occurrence of \"outpatient health care facilities\".\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective January 1, 2022, raised the required malpractice insurance from two hundred thousand dollars to two hundred fifty thousand dollars, raised the required amount of cash deposited with the superintendent of insurance from six hundred thousand dollars to seven hundred fifty thousand dollars; provided additional duties for the superintendent of insurance; provided that hospitals and outpatient health care facilities shall not participate in the medical review process, and that hospitals and outpatient health care facilities shall not participate in the patient's compensation fund beginning in the year 2027; in Subsection A, Paragraph A(1), after \"at least\", changed \"two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000)\" to \"two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000)\", after \"per occurrence or\", deleted \"for an individual health care provider, excluding hospitals and outpatient health care facilities\", after \"deposit the sum of\", changed \"six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000)\" to \"seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000)\", and after \"provided that\", added \"hospitals and outpatient health care facilities that establish financial responsibility through a policy of malpractice liability insurance may use any form of malpractice insurance; and provided further that for independent providers\"; in Subsection B, after \"additional charges for the\", deleted \"patient's compensation\", and after \"actuarial study\", deleted \"as provided in Section 41-5-25 NMSA 1978\" and added \"before determining base coverage or deposit and surcharges\"; and in Subsection C, after \"malpractice claim against it\", added the remainder of the subsection.\n\nStatute of limitations.— The Medical Malpractice Act's statute of limitations, 41-5-13 NMSA 1978, does not apply to health care providers that have not qualified under Subsection A of this section.Roberts v. Southwest Cmty. Health Servs., 1992-NMSC-042, 114 N.M. 248, 837 P.2d 442.\n\nGrant of summary judgment in favor of the hospital was reversed even though summary judgment was granted in favor of the doctor; the hospital could not take advantage of the statute of limitation in 41-5-13 NMSA 1978, as it was not a qualified healthcare provider under Subsection C of this section.Juarez v.

Southwest Cmty. Health Servs., 1992-NMSC-042, 114 N.M. 248, 837 P.2d 442.\n\nSuperintendent to maintain list of qualified providers.— This section creates in the superintendent of insurance some requirement to maintain a list of those whose qualified status affects suits against them.Otero v.

Beginning January 1, 2027, amounts due from a judgment or settlement against a hospital or hospital-controlled outpatient health care facility shall not be paid from the fund.\n\nL. The term \"occurrence\" shall not be construed in such a way as to limit recovery to only one maximum statutory payment if separate acts or omissions cause additional or enhanced injury or harm as a result of the separate acts or omissions. A patient who suffers two or more distinct injuries as a result of two or more different acts or omissions that occur at different times by one or more health care providers is entitled to up to the maximum statutory recovery for each injury.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 41-5-6, enacted by Laws 1992, ch. 33, § 4; 2021, ch. 16, § 3; 2021 (2nd S.S.), ch. 5, § 2; 2023, ch. 207, § 3.\n\nRepeals.— 2021 (2nd S.S.), ch. 5, § 3 repealed Laws 2021, ch. 16, § 3, effective January 1, 2022.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1992, ch. 33, § 4 repealed former 41-5-6 NMSA 1978, as enacted by Laws 1992, ch. 33, § 3, and enacted a new section, effective April 1, 1995.\n\nLaws 1991, ch. 264, § 4 repealed former 41-5-6 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1991, ch. 264, § 3, and enacted a new 41-5-6 NMSA 1978, effective July 1, 1992.\n\nLaws 1992, ch. 33, § 3 repealed former 41-5-6 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1991, ch. 264, § 3, and as enacted by Laws 1991, ch. 264, § 4, and enacted a former section, effective April 1, 1992.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, revised the limitation of recovery for certain claims against facilities that are not hospital-controlled; in Subsection C, after \"shall not exceed\", deleted \"the following amounts\" and added \"seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000)\", after \"brought against an\", added \"independent\", after \"outpatient health care facility\", deleted \"that is not majority-owned and -controlled by a hospital\", after \"calendar years 2022 and 2023\", deleted \"seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000) per occurrence\"; deleted former Paragraphs C(2) through C(5); added a new Subsection D; redesignated former Subsections D through H as Subsections E through I, respectively; in Subsection E, in the introductory clause, after \"against a hospital or\", deleted \"an\" and added \"a hospital-controlled\", and after \"outpatient health care facility\", deleted \"that is majority-owned and -controlled by a hospital\"; in Subsection I, added \"Except for an independent outpatient health care facility\"; added a new Subsection J; redesignated former Subsections I and J as Subsections K and L, respectively; and in Subsection K, added \"hospital-controlled\" preceding each occurrence of \"outpatient health care facility\".\n\nThe 2021 (2nd S.S.) amendment, effective January 1, 2022, raised personal liability and recovery caps for legal damages in medical malpractice claims brought against certain health care providers; in Subsection A, after \"Except for punitive damages and\", added \"past and future\", and after \"($600,000) per occurrence\", added \"for malpractice claims brought against health care providers if the injury or death occurred prior to January 1, 2022\"; deleted former Subsection B, which provided \"The value of accrued medical care and related benefits shall not be subject to the six hundred thousand dollar ($600,000) limitation\", added new Subsections B through F, and redesignated former Subsections C and D as Subsections G and H, respectively; in Subsection G, deleted \"Monetary damages\" and added \"The value of accrued medical care and related benefits\", after \"shall not be\", deleted \"awarded for future medical expenses in malpractice claims\" and added \"subject to any limitation\"; in Subsection H, after \"personal liability is limited to\", deleted \"two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000)\" and added \"two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000)\", after \"in excess of\", deleted \"two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000)\" and added \"two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000)\", after \"paid from the\", deleted \"patient's compensation\", after \"fund\", added \"except\", and after \"provided in\", deleted \"Section 41-5-25 NMSA 1978\" and added \"Subsection I of this section\"; and deleted former Subsection E and added Subsections I and J.\n\nThe constitutional right to trial by jury applies in cases brought under the Medical Malpractice Act.— Because causes of action brought under the Medical Malpractice Act (MMA), NMSA 1978, §§ 41-5-1 to -29, can be more generally described as causes of action in common-law medical negligence, and claims of common-law medical negligence were triable to a jury at the time the New Mexico Constitution was adopted and took effect, the constitutional right to trial by jury attaches to causes of action brought under the MMA.Siebert v. Okun, 2021-NMSC-016,overruling in part Salopek v. Friedman, 2013-NMCA-087, 308 P.3d 139.\n\nThe Medical Malpractice Act's nonmedical, nonpunitive damages cap does not invade the province of the jury.— The MMA nonmedical, nonpunitive damages cap gives legal consequence to the jury's finding on damages and does not violate a plaintiff's right to a jury trial under NM Const., Art. II, Sec. 12, because the right to trial by jury is satisfied when evidence is presented to a jury, which then deliberates and returns a verdict based on its factual findings. The legal consequence of that verdict is a matter of law, which the legislature has the authority to shape.Siebert v. Okun, 2021-NMSC-016,overruling in partSalopek v. Friedman, 2013-NMCA-087, 308 P.3d 139.\n\nWhere plaintiff successfully sued defendants for medical malpractice under the Medical Malpractice Act (MMA), NMSA 1978, §§ 41-5-1 to -29, and where, following the return of the jury's verdict, defendants moved to reduce the jury award of $2,600,000 to conform with the $600,000 cap on all nonmedical and nonpunitive damages in MMA actions, and where the district court denied defendants' motion, concluding that the MMA nonmedical, nonpunitive damages cap infringed the state constitutional right to a trial by jury, the district court erred in denying defendants' motion, because the MMA nonmedical, nonpunitive damages cap merely gives legal consequence to the jury's finding on damages and does not violate a plaintiff's right to a jury trial under NM Const., Art. II, Sec. 12.Siebert v. Okun, 2021-NMSC-016,overruling in partSalopek v. Friedman, 2013-NMCA-087, 308 P.3d 139.\n\nCap on medical malpractice damages is constitutional.— The cap on medical malpractice damages does not violate the right to trial by jury under Article II, Section 12 of the New Mexico Constitution, the separation of powers clause in Article III, Section 1 of the New Mexico Constitution, the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution, or the due process clause of the United States Constitution.Salopek v. Friedman, 2013-NMCA-087.\n\nLimits of recovery.— This section is not arbitrary and capricious and is rationally related to legislative goal of ensuring a source of recovery for victims of medical malpractice and curbing runaway medical costs, relying in part onTrujillo v. City of Albuquerque, 1998-NMSC-031, 125 N.M. 721, 965 P.2d 305;Fed. Express Corp. v. United States, 228 F. Supp 2d 1267 (D.N.M. 2002).\n\nFederal hospital.— Although not a \"qualified health care provider\" under 41-5-5 NMSA 1978, the liability of a federal hospital, operating in New Mexico, is subject to the $600,000 cap in Subsection A, but not the $200,000 cap in Subsection D, which assumes that the amount of damages in excess of $ 200,000 would be paid by the compensation fund into which the federal government did not contribute.Haceesa v. United States, 309 F.3d 722 (10th Cir. 2002).\n\nApplicability.— Where it was held that tribal law controlled in a malpractice action against the United States, the New Mexico medical malpractice cap did not apply.Cheromiah v. United States, 55 F. Supp. 2d 1295 (D.N.M. 1999).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Medical Malpractice Legislation in New Mexico,\" see 7 N.M.L. Rev. 5 (1976-77).\n\nAm.

A patient's claim is a subset of malpractice claims and the legislature intended only that patients' claims, not all malpractice claims, be made unassignable.Leger v. Gerety, 2022-NMSC-007,rev'g2019-NMCA-033, 444 P.3d 1036.\n\nLegislative intent.— The legislature intended the Medical Malpractice Act's (MMA), 41-5-1 to -29 NMSA 1978, requirements and restrictions to apply to all \"malpractice claims\" covered by the MMA and, accordingly, this section bars assignment of all malpractice claims for compensation covered by the MMA.Leger v.

X-Ray Assocs., 1996-NMSC-035, 121 N.M. 821, 918 P.2d 1321.\n\nDue process claim.— The constitutionality of the statute of repose, which serves to cut off a malpractice claimant's right to seek recovery, will not be evaluated under the strict-scrutiny test; the claimant's due process claim requires only a rational-basis analysis.Cummings v. X-Ray Assocs., 1996-NMSC-035, 121 N.M. 821, 918 P.2d 1321.\n\nSection violates due process.— This section violates due process because it allows medical malpractice claimants an unreasonably short period of time within which to bring an accrued cause of action.Garcia ex rel. Garcia v. La Farge, 1995-NMSC-019, 119 N.M. 532, 893 P.2d 428.\n\nThe provision in this section that requires a minor who experienced malpractice before the age of six to bring a claim under the Medical Malpractice Act [Chapter 41, Article 5 NMSA 1978] by his or her ninth birthday violates due process.Jaramillo v.

LaFarge, 1995-NMSC-019, 119 N.M. 532, 893 P.2d 428.\n\nDue process analysis.— The legislature may impose a statutory time deadline for commencing a cause of action as long as a reasonable time is provided for commencing suit. If a plaintiff is left with an unconstitutionally short period of time to file suit within the period of statute of repose, due process is violated. To fall under the due process exception to the statute of repose, the case must be unusual and involve exceptional circumstances resulting in an unusually short period of time within which to file suit.Cahn v. Berryman, 2015-NMCA-078, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-007.\n\nSection does not violate due process as applied.— Where plaintiff discovered she had a malpractice claim against defendant ten and one-half months before the statute of repose expired, and during the entire ten and one-half months period of time, the means for discovering defendant's identity were available and within plaintiff's control, plaintiff's due process rights were not violated because the ten and one-half month period was a constitutionally reasonable amount of time for plaintiff to bring her medical malpractice suit against defendant; plaintiff's claims against defendant were barred by this section when plaintiff filed suit against defendant eleven months after the three-year statute of repose expired.Cahn v. Berryman, 2015-NMCA-078, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-007.\n\nSection does not violate equal protection.— Where a patient sued a medical center and a doctor who practiced at the medical center for medical malpractice; the three-year limitation period expired on December 10, 2007; the patient filed the complaint on December 4, 2007 and served the medical center on December 11, 2007, one day after the expiration of the three-year limitation period; and the medical center's third party complaint against the doctor for equitable indemnification, which was filed on December 22, 2008, was barred, the preclusive effect of 41-5-13 NMSA 1978 did not violate the medical center's due process rights.Christus St. Vincent Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. Duarte-Afara, 2011-NMCA-112, 267 P.3d 70.\n\nThis section, as a statute of repose, does not implicate equal protection considerations because it operates uniformly upon all medical malpractice plaintiffs.Garcia ex rel. Garcia v. La Farge, 1995-NMSC-019, 119 N.M. 532, 893 P.2d 428.\n\nRational basis for classification.— The classification of health care providers created by this section is supported by a rational basis.Cummings v. X-Ray Assocs., 1996-NMSC-035, 121 N.M. 821, 918 P.2d 1321.\n\nAssuring adequate malpractice insurance.— By offering to qualified health care providers certain benefits that are not available to those who are not qualified, the legislature furthers its stated goal of assuring adequate malpractice insurance coverage in the New Mexico medical profession; this section was reasonably drafted to further a legitimate government interest.Cummings v. X-Ray Assocs., 1996-NMSC-035, 121 N.M. 821, 918 P.2d 1321.\n\nSection does not violate prohibition against special legislation.— This section does not violate the prohibition against special legislation because it was within the competence of the legislature to determine that the high costs of malpractice insurance distinguish the class of health care providers from the class of tortfeasors generally.Garcia ex rel. Garcia v. La Farge, 1995-NMSC-019, 119 N.M. 532, 893 P.2d 428.\n\nMalpractice action does not implicate fundamental rights.— A malpractice claim is an attempt by a patient to obtain something he or she does not yet possess: monetary compensation for an injury caused by the negligence of a health care practitioner. As such, a medical malpractice claim generally does not, for the patient, implicate any fundamental rights such as First Amendment rights, freedom of association, voting, interstate travel, privacy, and fairness in the deprivation of life, liberty or property.Cummings v. X-Ray Assocs., 1996-NMSC-035, 121 N.M. 821, 918 P.2d 1321.\n\nSection not applicable to non-qualified health care providers.— The Medical Malpractice Act's statute of limitations does not apply to health care providers that have not qualified under Subsection A of 41-5-5 NMSA 1978.Roberts v. Southwest Cmty. Health Servs., 1992-NMSC-042, 114 N.M. 248, 837 P.2d 442.\n\nSection applicable to wrongful death action based on malpractice.— The specific inclusion of a wrongful death claim within the definition of a malpractice claim makes the limitation period of this section applicable to a claim of malpractice resulting in wrongful death.Armijo v. Tandysh, 1981-NMCA-098, 98 N.M. 181, 646 P.2d 1245, cert. quashed, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794 (1982), and cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1016, 103 S. Ct. 377, 74 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1982),overruled on other grounds byRoberts v. Southwest Cmty. Health Servs., 1992-NMSC-042, 114 N.M. 248, 837 P.2d 442;Mackey v. Burke, 1984-NMCA-028, 102 N.M. 294, 694 P.2d 1359, cert. quashed, 102 N.M. 293, 694 P.2d 1358 (1985),overruled on other grounds byChavez v. Regents of Univ. of N.M., 1985-NMSC-114, 103 N.M. 606, 711 P.2d 883.\n\nA parent's claim for loss of consortium in a medical malpractice case is tolled alongside the minor's claim from which it is derived.— Where parents' minor child sustained injuries during the course of his birth and delivery at Lea regional medical center (LRMC) as a result of alleged negligent medical care provided by the child's doctor, and where, approximately five years later, parents and the child's guardian ad litem filed a complaint, asserting various claims, including claims for loss of consortium and negligent medical care against the doctor, the doctor's employer, and LRMC (defendants), and where the district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss parents' loss of consortium claim, concluding that parents brought their claim outside the three-year limitations period under both the Medical Malpractice Act's (MMA) statute of repose, § 41-5-13 NMSA 1978, and the general statute of limitations for personal injuries, § 37-1-8 NMSA 1978, the district court erred in granting defendants' motion to dismiss, because a parent's loss of consortium in a medical malpractice case is tolled alongside the minor's claim from which it is derived, pursuant to the minority tolling provisions of § 41-5-13 and § 37-1-10 NMSA 1978. The rationale for this rule includes protecting individuals from the burden of litigating multiple lawsuits, promoting judicial economy, minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions, and safeguarding minors.Garrity v. Driskill, 2022-NMCA-054, cert. denied,overruling Moncor Trust Co. ex rel. Flynn v. Feil, 1987-NMCA-015, 105 N.M. 444, 733 P.2d 1327 andoverruling in part Armijo v. Regents of Univ. of N.M., 1984-NMCA-118, 103 N.M. 183, 704 P.2d 437.\n\nSection inapplicable to minor beneficiaries under Wrongful Death Act.— The tolling provisions applicable to minors under the age of nine years contained in this section apply only to minors who suffer an alleged act of malpractice and not to minors who are beneficiaries under the Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 NMSA 1978].Moncor Trust Co. ex rel. Flynn v. Feil, 1987-NMCA-015, 105 N.M. 444, 733 P.2d 1327, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 421, 733 P.2d 869.\n\nConstruction with Tort Claims Act.— District court correctly applied the law when it estopped the doctor from asserting the statute of limitations defense under 41-4-15 NMSA 1978 because by choosing to place the doctor at a private institution, and not identify him as a public employee working in a public capacity, the state engaged in conduct that conveyed the indisputable impression to persons wishing to assert a claim that the doctor was an employee of the private institution and therefore the limitation for private entities applied.Hagen v. Faherty, 2003-NMCA-060, 133 N.M. 605, 66 P.3d 974, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 593, 66 P.3d 962.\n\nOccurrence rule governs claims under the Medical Malpractice Act.— The accrual date in which a patient must file a claim for medical malpractice is the date of the act or occurrence of the medical malpractice even if the patient is oblivious of any harm.Christus St. Vincent Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. Duarte-Afara, 2011-NMCA-112, 267 P.3d 70, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-010.\n\nWhen cause of action accrues.— The accrual date in which a patient must file a claim for medical malpractice is the date of the act or occurrence of the medical malpractice even if the patient is oblivious of any harm.Christus St. Vincent Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. Duarte-Afara, 2011-NMCA-112, 267 P.3d 70.\n\nIn medical malpractice actions where the health care provider is not qualified under the Medical Malpractice Act [Chapter 41, Article 5 NMSA 1978], the cause of action accrues when the plaintiff knows or with reasonable diligence should have known of the injury and its cause.Roberts v. Southwest Cmty. Health Servs., 1992-NMSC-042, 114 N.M. 248, 837 P.2d 442.\n\nThe triggering event of this section is determined by the occurrence rule. This event is unrelated to the accrual date of the cause of action, and does not entail whether the injury has even been discovered. In this sense, if, four years after the occurrence of medical malpractice, a patient learns they have been injured, their claim is forever barred because this section functions as a statute of repose.Cummings v. X-Ray Assocs., 1996-NMSC-035, 121 N.M. 821, 918 P.2d 1321.\n\nWhen cause of action for negligently prescribed medication accrues.— In a wrongful prescription case, the term \"act of malpractice\" refers to the discrete act taken by a health care provider of prescribing medication to a patient, not to any subsequent act of the patient and the three-year statute of limitations in 41-5-13 NMSA 1978 begins to run on the date medication is prescribed.Chavez v. Delgado, 2014-NMCA-014, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nWhere, on November 11, 2008, the patient requested a prescription for Simvastatin and the physician wrote the prescription; the next day, the physician called the prescription to the patient's pharmacy; the patient filled the prescription on December 3, 2008; on December 8, 2008, the patient was hospitalized with drug-induced rhabdomyolysis, purportedly caused by the interaction of Simvastatin and another medication the patient was taking; the patient died on February 21, 2010; and plaintiffs filed suit on December 1, 2011, the three-year statue of limitations began to run on November 11, 2008, the day the physician prescribed Simvastatin to the patient, and plaintiffs' claims against the physician were barred.Chavez v. Delgado, 2014-NMCA-014, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nFraudulent concealment.— There is no fraudulent concealment exception to the occurrence rule in this section; thus the statute of limitations did not toll for a plaintiff who filed an action more than three years after the act of malpractice, where she learned of the negligent act within the three-year period and in adequate time to file a malpractice action within three years, exercising ordinary diligence.Tomlinson v. George, 2003-NMCA-004, 133 N.M. 69, 61 P.3d 195,aff'd, 2005-NMSC-020, 138 N.M. 34, 116 P.3d 105.\n\nTo toll statute of limitations under doctrine of fraudulent concealment, a patient has the burden of showing: (1) that the physician knew of the alleged wrongful act and concealed it from the patient or had material information pertinent to its discovery which the physician failed to disclose, and (2) that the patient did not know, or could not have known through the exercise of reasonable diligence, of the patient's cause of action within the statutory period.Kern ex rel. v. St. Joseph Hosp., 1985-NMSC-031, 102 N.M. 452, 697 P.2d 135.\n\nFraudulent concealment requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant physician knew of the alleged negligent act and concealed the negligent act from the patient or had material information pertinent to discovery of the negligent act which the defendant failed to disclose.Tomlinson v. George, 2005-NMSC-020, 138 N.M. 34, 116 P.3d 105.\n\nFraudulent concealment requires that the plaintiff demonstrate that he or she did not know, and could not have discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence, his or her cause of action during the statutory period.Tomlinson v. George, 2005-NMSC-020, 138 N.M. 34, 116 P.3d 105.\n\nQuestions for fact finder in fraudulent concealment.— The question of a physician's knowledge of the error or concealment of pertinent facts that might have reasonably led to the discovery of the error and the related question of the patient's due diligence in discovering the cause of action are ordinarily for determination by the finder of fact.Kern ex rel. v. St. Joseph Hosp., 1985-NMSC-031, 102 N.M. 452, 697 P.2d 135.\n\nStatute tolled by nondisclosure of pertinent, not reasonably discoverable, facts.— The statute of limitations may be tolled where a physician has knowledge of facts relating to medical malpractice and fails to disclose such facts to the patient under circumstances where the patient may not be reasonably expected to learn of the improper acts.Keithley v. St. Joseph's Hosp., 1984-NMCA-104, 102 N.M. 565, 698 P.2d 435.\n\nProof required with allegation that statute tolled by fraud.— A plaintiff who alleges that the statute has been tolled by fraud, either active or passive, must establish that she did not have the means to discover the fraud.Keithley v. St. Joseph's Hosp., 1984-NMCA-104, 102 N.M. 565, 698 P.2d 435.\n\nFraudulent concealment inapplicable.— If a plaintiff discovers the injury within the time limit, fraudulent concealment does not apply because the defendant's actions have not prevented the plaintiff from filing the claim within the time period and the equitable remedy is not necessary.Tomlinson v. George, 2005-NMSC-020, 138 N.M. 34, 116 P.3d 105.\n\nStatute of repose is not tolled by fraudulent concealment when the plaintiff knew of his or her cause of action within the statutory period.Tomlinson v. George, 2005-NMSC-020, 138 N.M. 34, 116 P.3d 105.\n\nMetastasis of cancer not relevant trigger.— The plain language of this section establishes the date of the act of malpractice as the only relevant factor, without any reference to any subsequent harm; in New Mexico, the patient's awareness of metastasis of cancer is not the trigger for purposes of the statute of limitations.Cummings v. X-Ray Assocs., 1996-NMSC-035, 121 N.M. 821, 918 P.2d 1321.\n\nClaim barred.— An action by an employee against the physician employed by the employer to perform the medical examination was time barred since the examination occurred more than three years preceding the filing of the cause of action; however, an action against the employer was not barred since the employee was subsequently examined by a physician's assistant at the direction of the employer within the time period.Baer v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 1994-NMCA-124, 118 N.M. 685, 884 P.2d 841.\n\nBusiness entities qualify as health care providers.— Professional corporations and other types of professional medical organizations under which a medical professional operates are eligible to qualify as \"health care providers\" under the Medical Malpractice Act [Chapter 41, Article 5 NMSA 1978] and are entitled to the benefits of the act when they are sued for medical malpractice as long as they employ or consist of members who are licensed or certified by the state to provide the medical services listed in Subsection A of 41-5-3 NMSA 1978.Baker v. Hedstrom, 2013-NMSC-043,aff'g on other grounds, 2012-NMCA-073.\n\nBusiness entities, such as professional corporations and limited liability companies, that are involved in the medical treatment of patients and that are neither hospitals nor outpatient health care facilities, qualify as health care providers.Baker v. Hedstrom, 2012-NMCA-073, 284 P.3d 400, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-007.\n\nEvidence insufficient to toll statute of limitations.Ealy v. Sheppeck, 1983-NMCA-049, 100 N.M. 250, 669 P.2d 259,overruled in part byJuarez v. Nelson, 2003-NMCA-011, 133 N.M. 168, 61 P.3d 877.\n\nThe statute of limitations was not tolled by fraudulent concealment on the part of the doctor as two different people told the individual that the doctor did not do all that he could have for the individual's husband.Juarez v. Nelson, 2003-NMCA-011, 133 N.M. 168, 61 P.3d 877,overruled on other grounds byTomlinson v. George, 2005-NMSC-020, 138 N.M. 34, 116 P.3d 105.\n\nDismissal without prejudice.— Where the court had entered a stipulated order staying the proceedings until 30 days after the medical review commission rendered a decision on plaintiff's claim, and defendant filed a motion to lift the stay after plaintiff did not file an application with the commission, because the statute of limitations had run, the dismissal without prejudice effectively dismissed the case on a permanent basis.Belser v. O'Cleireachain, 2005-NMCA-073, 137 N.M. 623, 114 P.3d 303, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-006, 137 N.M. 766, 115 P.3d 229.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Medical Malpractice Legislation in New Mexico,\" see 7 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. The \"New Mexico medical review commission\" is created. The function of the New Mexico medical review commission is to provide panels to review all malpractice claims against independent providers who are natural persons covered by the Medical Malpractice Act.\n\nB. Those eligible to sit on a panel shall consist of health care providers licensed pursuant to New Mexico law and residing in New Mexico and members of the state bar.\n\nC. The only cases that a panel will consider are cases involving an alleged act of malpractice occurring in New Mexico by an independent provider qualified under the Medical Malpractice Act. Beginning July 1, 2021, cases involving an alleged act of malpractice by a hospital or outpatient health care facility shall not be considered and such claims shall not be filed with the New Mexico medical review commission.\n\nD. An attorney shall submit a case for the consideration of a panel, prior to filing a complaint in any district court or other court sitting in New Mexico, by addressing an application, in writing, signed by the patient or the patient's attorney, to the director of the New Mexico medical review commission.\n\nE. The director of the New Mexico medical review commission shall be an attorney appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the chief justice of the New Mexico supreme court.\n\nF. The chief justice shall set the director's salary and report the salary to the superintendent in the superintendent's capacity as custodian of the fund.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 58-33-14, enacted by Laws 1976, ch. 2, § 14; 2021, ch. 16, § 7.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective July 1, 2021, revised the scope of the medical review commission, and provided that beginning July 1, 2021, cases involving an alleged act of malpractice by a hospital or outpatient health care facility shall not be considered by, or filed with, the medical review commission; in the section heading, after \"Medical review commission\", added \"independent providers\"; in Subsection A, after \"claims against\", deleted \"health care\" and added \"independent\", and after \"providers\", added who are natural persons\"; in Subsection C, added \"The only\", after \"New Mexico by\", changed \"health care providers\" to \"an independent provider\", and after \"the Medical Malpractice Act.\", added the remainder of the subsection; and in Subsection E, after \"the New Mexico medical review commission\", changed \"will\" to \"shall\".\n\nClaim submitted as of date of mailing.— The date of mailing an application for a claim to the review commission constitutes submission of the claim for purposes of Subsection D of this section.Otero v.

No malpractice action may be filed in any court against a qualifying independent provider or the independent provider's employer, master or principal based on a theory of respondeat superior or any other derivative theory of recovery before application is made to the New Mexico medical review commission and its decision is rendered; provided, however, that an independent provider and the patient may stipulate to forego the panel process.\n\nB. This application shall contain the following:\n\n(1) the name of the health care provider against which the claims are asserted;\n\n(2) a short and plain statement of the grounds as to why the New Mexico medical review commission has jurisdiction over the claims being asserted;\n\n(3) the specific date or date range when the malpractice allegedly occurred;\n\n(4) so far as known, a brief statement of the facts supporting the patient's malpractice claim; and\n\n(5) a statement authorizing the panel to obtain access to all medical and hospital records and information pertaining to the matter giving rise to the application and, for the purposes of its consideration of the matter only, waiving any claim of privilege as to the contents of those records. Nothing in that statement shall in any way be construed as waiving that privilege for any other purpose or in any other context, in or out of court.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 58-33-15, enacted by Laws 1976, ch. 2, § 15; 2021, ch. 16, § 8.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective January 1, 2022, provided that no malpractice action may be filed based on a theory of respondeat superior or any other derivative theory of recovery before application is made to the New Mexico medical review commission and its decision is rendered, provided that an independent provider and the patient may stipulate to forego the panel process, and revised the required contents of an application to the New Mexico medical review commission; in Subsection A, after \"qualifying\", deleted \"health care\" and added \"independent\", after \"provider\", added \"or the independent provider's employer, master or principal based on a theory of respondeat superior or any other derivative theory of recovery\", and after \"rendered\", added the remainder of the subsection; and in Subsection B, deleted former Paragraph B(1) and added new Paragraphs B(1) through B(4), and redesignated former Paragraph B(2) as Paragraph B(5).\n\nSection does not deprive all plaintiffs of constitutional right of access to courts.Jiron v. Mahlab, 1983-NMSC-022, 99 N.M. 425, 659 P.2d 311.\n\nUnconstitutional to cause undue delay.— Where the requirement of first going before the medical review commission causes undue delay prejudicing a plaintiff by the loss of witnesses or parties, the plaintiff is unconstitutionally deprived of his right of access to the courts.Jiron v. Mahlab, 1983-NMSC-022, 99 N.M. 425, 659 P.2d 311.\n\nDecision by medical review commission was not jurisdictional prerequisiteto the filing of a complaint in court against a qualified health care provider for medical malpractice.Rupp v.

Lea Reg'l Hosp., 1990-NMSC-076, 110 N.M. 378, 796 P.2d 599.\n\nNot necessary to bring each allegation before commission.— Under this section, it is not necessary that each of plaintiff's counts, nor each of plaintiff's allegations, be presented to the medical review commission, as the district court has subject matter jurisdiction over medical malpractice and battery claims not submitted to the commission where application satisfied requirements of this section.Trujillo v. Puro, 1984-NMCA-050, 101 N.M. 408, 683 P.2d 963, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 362, 683 P.2d 44.\n\nClaims not necessary to bring before commission.— Claims for negligent misrepresentation and intentional infliction of emotional distress do not first have to be presented to the medical review commission because they do not come within the definition of a malpractice claim.Trujillo v. Puro, 1984-NMCA-050, 101 N.M. 408, 683 P.2d 963, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 362, 683 P.2d 44.\n\nExcused failure to file claim with commission.— Misinformation supplied by the office of the state superintendent of insurance, regarding who were qualified health care providers, excused plaintiff's failure to file claim with the commission before filing a complaint in district court.Otero v. Zouhar, 1985-NMSC-021, 102 N.M. 482, 697 P.2d 482,overruled on other grounds byGrantland v. Lea Reg'l Hosp., 1990-NMSC-076, 110 N.M. 378, 796 P.2d 599.\n\nStatute of limitation tolled regardless of outcome.— This section, which tolls the statute of limitations period upon submission of a case to the commission, should be enforced according to its terms whether the commission's determination is that the health care provider is not qualified and the claim is consequently rejected, or that the health care provider is qualified and the claim is resolved on its merits.Grantland v. Lea Reg'l Hosp., 1990-NMSC-076, 110 N.M. 378, 796 P.2d 599.\n\nApplication was sufficient to toll statute of limitations.— Where plaintiff filed an application to the New Mexico medical review commission (MRC) alleging that as a result of medical negligence plaintiff's pregnancy was aborted, the district court erred in dismissing the complaint against defendant on the basis that plaintiff's application was not specific enough in making allegations against defendant to trigger the Medical Malpractice Act's, NMSA 1978, §§ 41-5-1 to -29, tolling provision on plaintiff's claims against defendant. Plaintiff's application to the MRC clearly named defendant, and the application recited a brief statement of the facts describing the dates and the circumstances, as far as they were known, of the acts and omissions of named employees and physicians working in defendant's hospitals.Romero v. Lovelace Health Sys., Inc., 2020-NMSC-001,rev'gA-1-CA-35177, mem. Op. (N.M. Ct.

The same information shall be available to the advisory board for review, including financial information and data, and excluding individually identifying case information, which information shall not be subject to the Inspection of Public Records Act [Chapter 14, Article 2 NMSA 1978]. The superintendent, the third-party actuary or the advisory board shall not use or disclose the information for any purpose other than to fulfill the duties pursuant to this subsection.\n\nE. The surcharge shall be collected on the same basis as premiums by each insurer from the health care provider. The surcharge shall be due and payable within thirty days after the premiums for malpractice liability insurance have been received by the insurer from the health care provider in New Mexico. If the surcharge is collected but not paid timely, the superintendent may suspend the certificate of authority of the insurer until the annual premium surcharge is paid.\n\nF. Surcharges shall be set by October 31 of each year for the next calendar year. Beginning in 2021, the surcharges shall be set with the intention of bringing the fund to solvency with no projected deficit by December 31, 2026. All qualified and participating hospitals and outpatient health care facilities shall cure any fund deficit attributable to hospitals and outpatient health care facilities by December 31, 2026.\n\nG. If the fund would be exhausted by payment of all claims allowed during a particular calendar year, then the amounts paid to each patient and other parties obtaining judgments shall be prorated, with each such party receiving an amount equal to the percentage the party's own payment schedule bears to the total of payment schedules outstanding and payable by the fund. Any amounts due and unpaid as a result of such proration shall be paid in the following calendar years.\n\nH. Upon receipt of one of the proofs of authenticity listed in this subsection, reflecting a judgment for damages rendered pursuant to the Medical Malpractice Act, the superintendent shall issue or have issued warrants in accordance with the payment schedule constructed by the court and made a part of its final judgment. The only claim against the fund shall be a voucher or other appropriate request by the superintendent after the superintendent receives:\n\n(1) until January 1, 2022, a certified copy of a final judgment in excess of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) against a health care provider;\n\n(2) until January 1, 2022, a certified copy of a court-approved settlement or certification of settlement made prior to initiating suit, signed by both parties, in excess of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) against a health care provider; or\n\n(3) until January 1, 2022, a certified copy of a final judgment less than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) and an affidavit of a health care provider or its insurer attesting that payments made pursuant to Subsection B of Section 41-5-7 NMSA 1978, combined with the monetary recovery, exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000).\n\nI. On or after January 1, 2022, the amounts specified in Paragraphs (1) through (3) of Subsection H of this section shall be two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 41-5-25, enacted by Laws 1992, ch. 33, § 9; 1997, ch. 109, § 1; 2021, ch. 16, § 13.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1990, ch. 111, § 2 repealed former 41-5-25 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1990, ch. 111, § 1, relating to patient's compensation fund, and enacted a new 41-5-25 NMSA 1978, effective July 1, 1991.\n\nLaws 1990, ch. 111, § 3 repealed Laws 1989, ch. 324, § 43 which enacted 41-5-25 NMSA 1978 to become effective on July 1, 1990.\n\nLaws 1991, ch. 264, § 9 repealed former 41-5-25 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1991, ch. 264, § 8, and enacted a new 41-5-25 NMSA 1978, effective July 1, 1992.\n\nLaws 1991, ch. 264, § 10 repealed former 41-5-25 NMSA 1978, as enacted by Laws 1991, ch. 264, § 9, and enacted a new 41-5-25 NMSA 1978, effective July 1, 1993.\n\nLaws 1992, ch. 33, § 7 repealed former 41-5-25 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1991, ch. 264, § 8, and as enacted by Laws 1991, ch. 264, § 10, and enacted a new section, effective April 1, 1992.\n\nLaws 1992, ch. 33, § 8 repealed former 41-5-25 NMSA 1978, as enacted by Laws 1992, ch. 33, § 7, and enacted a new section, effective April 1, 1993.\n\nLaws 1992, ch. 33, § 9 repealed former 41-5-25 NMSA 1978, as enacted by Laws 1992, ch. 33, § 8, and enacted a new section, effective April 1, 1994.\n\nThe 2021 amendment,effective July 1, 2021, provided the means of funding the patient's compensation fund, required the superintendent of insurance to contract for the administration and operation of the fund with a qualified, licensed third-party administrator, required the third-party administrator to provide an annual audit of the fund to the superintendent of insurance, revised the procedures for determining the annual surcharge on qualifying New Mexico health care providers, provided that annual surcharges shall be set by October 31 of each year for the next calendar year, and provided that, after January 1, 2022, the superintendent of insurance must approve any settlement of a claim for more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars, up from two hundred thousand dollars prior to January 1, 2022; in the section heading, after \"Patient's compensation fund\", added \"third-party administrator; actuarial studies; surcharges; claims; proration; proofs of authenticity\"; in Subsection A, after \"'patient's compensation fund'\", deleted \"to be collected and received by the superintendent for exclusive use for the purpose stated in the Medical Malpractice Act\" and added \"is created as a nonreverting fund in the state treasury.

This approach circumvented the typical administrative process, a tactic which New Mexico courts have looked at with disfavor.Beecher Carlson Ins. Serv. v.
