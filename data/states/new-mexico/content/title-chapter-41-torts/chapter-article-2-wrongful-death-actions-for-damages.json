      "text": "Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of another, although such death shall have been caused under such circumstances as amount in law to a felony, and the act, or neglect, or default, is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, then, and in every such case, the person who, or the corporation which, would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured.\n\nHistory:Laws 1882, ch. 61, § 2; C.L. 1884, § 2309; Laws 1891, ch. 49, § 1; C.L. 1897, § 3214; Code 1915, § 1821; C.S. 1929, § 36-102; 1941 Comp., § 24-101; 1953 Comp., § 22-20-1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For action to be brought by personal representative,see41-2-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor survival of action,see37-2-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor nonliability to suit and defenses denied employers under Workers' Compensation Law,see52-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nApplicability of Missouri prior construction.— Because statute [41-2-1 through 41-2-4 NMSA 1978] was adopted from Missouri, the rule that a statute adopted or borrowed from another state is presumed to include its prior construction by the courts of that state is applicable to these statutes.White v. Montoya, 1942-NMSC-031, 46 N.M. 241, 126 P.2d 471.\n\nMissouri views often followed.— The New Mexico Supreme Court has often followed the views of the Missouri Supreme Court in its interpretations of this section.Langham v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 1975-NMSC-064, 88 N.M. 516, 543 P.2d 484.\n\nEffect of post-borrowing construction.— This statute was originally taken from Missouri and while a case decided long after the statute was adopted by New Mexico is entitled to respectful consideration, it is not controlling.Cain v. Bowlby, 114 F.2d 519 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 311 U.S. 710, 61 S. Ct. 319, 85 L. Ed. 462 (1940).\n\nConstruction of section.— This section is a derogation of common law and must be strictly construed.Cain v. Bowlby, 114 F.2d 519 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 311 U.S. 710, 61 S. Ct. 319, 85 L. Ed. 462 (1940).\n\nPurpose of section.— This section has to some degree an objective of public punishment, and was designed in part at least to act as a deterrent to the negligent conduct of others, and thereby promote public safety and welfare.Trujillo v. Prince, 1938-NMSC-024, 42 N.M. 337, 78 P.2d 145.\n\nNegligence made costly.— The statutes [41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978] allowing damages for wrongful act or neglect causing death have for their purpose more than compensation. It is intended to promote safety of life and limb by making negligence that causes death costly to the wrongdoer.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14;Langham v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 1975-NMSC-064, 88 N.M. 516, 543 P.2d 484.\n\nThis section is a survival statuteunder which the cause of action arises at time of death.State ex rel. De Moss v. Dist. Court, 1951-NMSC-010, 55 N.M. 135, 227 P.2d 937.\n\nThe death by wrongful act statute is a \"survival\" statute and consequently, the cause of action arises when the tort is committed (now at death), thus barring an action therefor at the end of one year (now three years) thereafter.Natseway v. Jojola, 1952-NMSC-104, 56 N.M. 793, 251 P.2d 274 (decided under prior law).\n\nThe remedy provided in 41-2-4 NMSA 1978 is exclusive.In re Estate of Reilly, 1957-NMSC-095, 63 N.M. 352, 319 P.2d 1069.\n\nScope of limitation.— This statute creates a new right and its limitation is not on the remedy alone, but on the right itself.Natseway v. Jojola, 1952-NMSC-10456 N.M. 793, 251 P.2d 274.\n\nEffect of limitation.— The New Mexico Wrongful Death Act creates a cause of action which did not exist at common law and the limitation provisions thereof are not only a limitation on the remedy, but also on the right to institute such an action.Perry v. Staver, 1970-NMCA-096, 81 N.M. 766, 473 P.2d 380.\n\nLaw of the place of the wrong governsthe right of action for death.McKenzie v. K.S.N. Co., 1968-NMCA-044, 79 N.M. 314, 442 P.2d 804.\n\nII. STANDING TO SUE.\n\nEffect of intervention by widow and child.— Permitting persons claiming to be the decedent's widow and child to intervene is not reversible error where defendants' counsel insisted that the parties claiming injury should be definitely named in the complaint, and that the injured parties were the surviving widow and children. The error was invited and defendants were in no position to complain.Hall v. Stiles, 1953-NMSC-041, 57 N.M. 281, 258 P.2d 386.\n\nScope of \"personal representative\".— Temporary, special and ancillary administrators are included in the term \"personal representative\" as used in wrongful death statutes, and the term includes an administrator de bonis non when the regular administrator refuses to sue.Henkel v. Hood, 1945-NMSC-006, 49 N.M. 45, 156 P.2d 790.\n\nIdentification of child as a beneficiary.— New Mexico law permits the admission of evidence identifying the decedent's children in a wrongful death action and the trial court did err by admitting evidence that the decedent had a child by a prior marriage.Harris v. Illinois-California Express, 687 F.2d 1361 (10th Cir. 1982).\n\nThe cause of action under the Wrongful Death Act is in the personal representative.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nActions under the Wrongful Death Act may be brought by the personal representative of the deceased person only.Hall v. Stiles, 1953-NMSC-041, 57 N.M. 281,258 P.2d 386.\n\nAppointment of co-personal representative not required.— Where an adversity of interest between the illegitimate child of the decedent and the personal representative of the decedent exists, appointing a co-personal representative is not required where appointment would not remedy the adversity.Spoon v. Mata, 2014-NMCA-115.\n\nEffect of designation.— Where a statute gives the cause of action and designates the persons who may be sued, they alone are authorized to be sued.Ickes v. Brimhall, 1938-NMSC-036, 42 N.M. 412, 79 P.2d 942.\n\nAdministrator may file suit under this sectionto recover damages for wrongful death.Romero v. Atchinson, T. & S.F. Ry., 1903-NMSC-008, 11 N.M. 679, 72 P. 37.\n\nRepresentative to serve as trustee.— The personal representative who makes a recovery under this section serves as a trustee, a \"statutory trustee,\" for discoverable and identifiable beneficiaries in the line of named kinship or descent.Baca v. Baca, 1963-NMSC-043, 71 N.M. 468, 379 P.2d 765.\n\nPersonal representative stands in the place of statutory beneficiaries.— Where personal representative's role in wrongful death action is to stand in the place of the statutory beneficiaries, to centralize claims, and to prevent multiple and possibly contradictory lawsuits, statutory beneficiaries should not be allowed to intrude on the role of a properly appointed personal representative.Spoon v. Mata, 2014-NMCA-115.\n\nDisqualification of personal representative not required.— Where personal representative maintained that the illegitimate child of the decedent in a wrongful death action was entitled to the statutory share of wrongful death proceeds and that the personal representative intended to fulfill her duty towards the child, there was not sufficient adversity of interest requiring the personal representative's disqualification or appointment of co-personal representative.Spoon v. Mata, 2014-NMCA-115.\n\nThe fact that the personal representative is also pursuing individual claims in a wrongful death lawsuit is not a sufficient basisby itself to presume that the interests of the personal representative and the statutory beneficiaries are so adverse as to preclude the individual from representing the statutory beneficiaries' interest in the action.Spoon v. Mata, 2014-NMCA-115.\n\nConflict of laws.— It is unimportant that the community administrator would not have had power to bring suit in Texas, as power of personal representative in New Mexico is measured by the laws of this state, since the law of Texas is looked to only to determine whether the party meets the broad definition of \"personal representative.\"Henkel v. Hood, 1945-NMSC-006, 49 N.M. 45, 156 P.2d 790.\n\nWrongful death and estate functions contrasted.— Wrongful death suit under this act has no relation to the estate, it being incidental that a \"personal representative\" is named to bring suit and it is not because this would fall within those duties, but because someone must be named and our legislature has fixed the personal representative of that individual.Henkel v. Hood, 1945-NMSC-006, 49 N.M. 45, 156 P.2d 790.\n\nSource of personal representative authority.— Since character of \"personal representative\" under wrongful death statute is entirely foreign to and unconnected with character as estate administrator, the authority to bring the action flows entirely from the wrongful death statute itself and not from the probate or other estate laws.Henkel v. Hood, 1945-NMSC-006, 49 N.M. 45, 156 P.2d 790.\n\nIII. CLAIMS COVERED.\n\nConstitutionality where recovery against carrier employee precluded.— Having thus afforded a fixed penalty against the carrier for wrongful death, it is not a denial of the equal protection of the law for the legislature to provide that such sum should be exclusive of all other liability for wrongful death, thereby precluding recovery against the negligent employee.Schloss v. Matteucci, 260 F.2d 16 (10th Cir. 1958).\n\nThis section applies where injury sued upon resulted in death.Kilkenny v. Kenney, 1961-NMSC-019, 68 N.M. 266, 361 P.2d 149.\n\nEffect on nonresident alien.— The word \"person\" in this section includes a nonresident alien who is present illegally in the state of New Mexico.Torres v. Sierra, 1976-NMCA-064, 89 N.M. 441, 553 P.2d 721, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.\n\nTorts against Indians.— The cause of action which an Indian acquires when a tort is committed against that Indian is property which the Indian may acquire or become invested with, particularly if the tort is committed outside of an Indian reservation by a state citizen who is not an Indian, and where that Indian is killed as a result of a tort, the cause of action survives.Trujillo v. Prince, 1938-NMSC-024, 42 N.M. 337, 78 P.2d 145.\n\nProbate court jurisdiction over Indians.— A New Mexico probate court had jurisdiction to appoint an administrator for a deceased reservation Indian to enforce the right of action created by this section.Trujillo v. Prince, 1938-NMSC-024, 42 N.M. 337, 78 P.2d 145.\n\nSurvival of kindred not required.— A right of action under the Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978] is not dependent or conditioned upon the survival of kindred.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nSpousal consortium claim recognized.— New Mexico recognizes a claim for loss of spousal consortium. This cause of action imposes no new conduct obligation on potential defendants.Romero v. Byers, 1994-NMSC-031, 117 N.M. 422, 872 P.2d 840.\n\nMurder conviction required for forfeiture.— Section 30-2-9 NMSA 1978 requires a conviction of murder, and did not apply to require forfeiture of husband's rights as a beneficiary under the Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978] when the husband was convicted of vehicular homicide in the death of his wife.Aranda v. Camacho, 1997-NMCA-010, 122 N.M. 763, 931 P.2d 757.\n\nA nonviable fetus,a fetus incapable of sustaining life outside the mother's womb, is not a \"person\" under the Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978].Miller v. Kirk, 1995-NMSC-067, 120 N.M. 654, 905 P.2d 194.\n\nRight of recovery provided for wrongful death of viable fetus.— The legislature in enacting this section intended that a viable fetus be included within the word \"person\" in this section and, therefore, it intended to provide a right of recovery for the wrongful death of a viable fetus.Salazar v. St. Vincent Hosp., 1980-NMCA-051, 95 N.M. 150, 619 P.2d 826, cert. quashed, 94 N.M. 806, 617 P.2d 1321.\n\nExceptions to section.— While this section, if standing alone, would apply to all deaths resulting from the negligence of corporations and individuals, 41-2-4 NMSA 1978 is an exception thereto.White v. Montoya, 1942-NMSC-031, 46 N.M. 241, 126 P.2d 471.\n\nCommon carrier action exclusive.— Right of action for wrongful death caused by a common carrier is exclusive of the right of action for wrongful death caused by a person or corporation other than the common carrier.Mallory v. Pioneer S.W. Stages, Inc., 54 F.2d 559 (10th Cir. 1931).\n\nEffect on manufacturer of \"public conveyance\".— The manufacturer of a \"public conveyance\" can be held liable for damages where the passengers died as a result of defects in the conveyance, and the remedy provided by 41-2-4 NMSA 1978 against the \"owner\" of a defective \"public conveyance\" does not provide the only remedy.Langham v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 1975-NMSC-064, 88 N.M. 516, 543 P.2d 484.\n\nRecovery against \"employee-driver\" of \"public conveyance\".— Recovery may not be had under either this section or 41-2-4 NMSA 1978 of the wrongful death statutes against the \"employee-driver\" of a \"public conveyance.\"Langham v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 1975-NMSC-064, 88 N.M. 516, 543 P.2d 484.\n\nSuit by third person against insurer barred.— Injured third person cannot proceed directly against insurer or join insurer and insured as defendants in the absence of contractual or statutory provisions.Chavez v. Pino, 1974-NMCA-071, 86 N.M. 464, 525 P.2d 391.\n\nNo liability for death.— Defendants, who owned and operated a heavy construction business and maintained a pond on their premises, were not guilty of wrongful acts where a nine-year-old child, who had the capacity to comprehend and avoid the danger incurred, got on a raft in the pond, jumped in for a swim and drowned.Mellas v. Lowdermilk, 1954-NMSC-057, 58 N.M. 363, 271 P.2d 399.\n\nEffect on action for loss of consortium.— The Wrongful Death Act does not apply to common-law remedies that existed prior to this act and which were not repealed; therefore, the statute of limitations applicable to the wrongful death action is not applicable to the husband's common-law right of action for loss of consortium.Kilkenny v. Kenney, 1961-NMSC-019, 68 N.M. 266, 361 P.2d 149.\n\nIV. DEFENSES.\n\nApplicability of saving clause for infants.— The statute providing a saving clause for infants [37-1-10 NMSA 1978] is not applicable to the death by wrongful act statute.Natseway v. Jojola, 1952-NMSC-10456 N.M. 793, 251 P.2d 274.\n\nNo interspousal immunity.— There is no immunity from tort liability between spouses by reason of that relationship.Maestas v. Overton, 1975-NMSC-004, 87 N.M. 213, 531 P.2d 947.\n\nWhen action barred.— Not only the remedy but the right to maintain suit is barred where damages are sought for wrongful death on account of alleged negligence of relator in performing surgery on decedent and complaint is filed more than one year (now three years) after death occurred.State ex rel. De Moss v. Dist. Court, 1951-NMSC-010, 55 N.M. 135, 227 P.2d 937.\n\nCause of action for wrongful death is barred where action is brought within one year (now three years) from the date of the wrongful death, but more than one year after the tort is committed.Natseway v. Jojola, 1952-NMSC-104, 56 N.M. 793, 251 P.2d 274 (decided under prior law).\n\nLast clear chance doctrine held improper.— In a head-on collision between decedent's automobile and a commercial truck-trailer on a two-lane highway with both drivers having the potential of sighting the other for a distance of more than 600 feet before meeting, the possibility that the collision might have been avoided had the defendant continued in the proper lane or had turned right instead of left was of no legal significance. The concept of a last clear chance is negated by either the existence of a sudden emergency or by the existence of equal opportunity to act, and it was error for the trial court to instruct the jury on the doctrine of last clear chance.Darter v. Greiner, 301 F.2d 772 (10th Cir. 1962).\n\nDefense of suicide.— Where decedent, who was a pedestrian, was struck by defendant's vehicle and killed; prior to the accident, decedent told some friends that decedent was going to kill decedent; in a subsequent telephone conversation, decedent told a friend that decedent was \"walking between cars\"; and in a wrongful death action, defendant took the position that decedent had committed suicide, the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the use of the term \"suicide\" at trial.Zia Trust, Inc. v. Aragon, 2011-NMCA-076, 150 N.M. 763, 258 P.3d 1146, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-006, 150 N.M. 763, 266 P.3d 632.\n\nInapplicability of limitations of actions.— Provisions of 37-1-14 NMSA 1978, concerning limitations of actions, are inapplicable to the Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978].Perry v. Staver, 1970-NMCA-096, 81 N.M. 766, 473 P.2d 380.\n\nV. EVIDENCE.\n\nPresumption of due care.— In a wrongful death action, deceased is presumed to have used due care and not to have been guilty of contributory negligence.Hogsett v. Hanna, 1936-NMSC-063, 41 N.M. 22, 63 P.2d 540.\n\nWhen writ of prohibition made absolute.— In a malpractice case against a surgeon, the supreme court will make absolute its alternative writ of prohibition where the principal witness is dead, trial would be expensive and regardless of the verdict the professional reputation of the defendant would be damaged, judgment would be reversed and case remanded with instructions to dismiss it.State ex rel. De Moss v. Dist. Court, 1951-NMSC-010, 55 N.M. 135, 227 P.2d 937.\n\nBurden of proof.— In a wrongful death claim, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that the claimed wrongful act was the proximate cause of the death.Lopez v. Maes, 1970-NMCA-084, 81 N.M. 693, 472 P.2d 658, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 721, 472 P.2d 984.\n\nThe burden of establishing a timely presentment of a claim against an estate, pursuant to 45-3-803 NMSA 1978, rests upon the claimant, and nothing in the statutes allowing recovery for wrongful death, 41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978, expresses a legislative intent to create an exception.Corlett v. Smith, 1987-NMCA-099, 106 N.M. 207, 740 P.2d 1191, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.\n\nSufficient evidence of duty and breach of duty in wrongful death action.— Where the personal representative of the wrongful death estate of decedent sued three entities, a nursing home and two of its ownership companies, asserting that the three entities were negligent in the care they provided for decedent, and where the jury found that each of the defendants was negligent and caused injury or damages to decedent, allocated a percentage of the negligence to each defendant, and also found that defendants were engaged in a joint venture which imposed joint and several liability, and where defendants claimed that the evidence failed to establish that the two ownership companies owed any duty to decedent or that a duty was breached or caused decedent's injury or death, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict where the evidence established that the nursing facility contracted with the ownership companies to perform the nursing facility's management-related duties, including coordination, supervision and assessment of adequate staff, but that the ownership companies failed to ensure adequate staffing, that the ownership companies' policies and procedures related to staffing were inadequate and irresponsible, and that there were numerous violations of the standard of care involving decedent. From this evidence, a reasonable jury could infer that defendants failed to ensure quality assurance standards were met, that staffing was inadequate, and that those failures were a cause of decedent's injuries.Collado v. Fiesta Park Healthcare, 2023-NMCA-014, cert. denied.\n\nWhere second vehicle involved.— Where there is absolutely no evidence in the record to show that decedent was alive when decedent's body was run over by the second vehicle, and no evidence to show this act by the second driver in any way contributed to the death, the burden was on plaintiff to not only show that the second driver was negligent, but that the second driver's negligence was the proximate cause, or at least a concurring proximate cause, of the death.Lopez v. Maes, 1970-NMCA-084, 81 N.M. 693, 472 P.2d 658, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 721, 472 P.2d 984.\n\nIn the absence of any evidence to show that death resulted from the body being run over by the second vehicle, the first driver's failure to remove the body from the highway cannot possibly be said to have proximately caused this death.Lopez v. Maes, 1970-NMCA-084, 81 N.M. 693, 472 P.2d 658, cert. denied, 81 N.M. 721, 472 P.2d 984.\n\nVI. DAMAGES.\n\nEffect on damages to wife's executor and husband.— The provisions of 41-2-3 NMSA 1978 when considered with this section warrant the allowance to the personal representative of the decedent, damages prior to death, provided they are not the same as those for which the husband, individually, has a right of recovery.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nAuthority for damages between injury and death.— The right of the administrator to recover damages sustained by decedent between the date of the injury and the date of death falls within the provisions of the Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978], provided these damages are not the same as those for which the husband, individually, has a right of recovery.Kilkenny v. Kenney, 1961-NMSC-019, 68 N.M. 266, 361 P.2d 149.\n\nDetermining damages.— The age, earning capacity, health, habits and probable duration of life are all things to be considered in determining the quantum of damages for death, and an award of $7,500 for a man forty-five years of age, educated, in good health, and capable of earning $200 a month, is not excessive.Duncan v. Madrid, 1940-NMSC-029, 44 N.M. 249, 101 P.2d 382.\n\nIn death actions, the age, occupation, earning capacity, rate of wages, health, habits and probable duration of the life are proper elements of inquiry.Hall v. Stiles, 1953-NMSC-041, 57 N.M. 281, 258 P.2d 386.\n\nWhen husband performed household services, other income-producing activity could not be undertaken. Further, specific costs would be incurred if someone else were retained to perform them. The value of those services is an evidentiary item admissible in establishing the present worth of husband's life.Corlett v. Smith, 1988-NMCA-067, 107 N.M. 707, 763 P.2d 1172, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 610, 762 P.2d 897.\n\nValue is present worth.— The worth of the life of the deceased is not all that the deceased would earn in a lifetime, but the present worth, taking into consideration the earning power of money.Mares v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Co., 1938-NMSC-032, 42 N.M. 473, 82 P.2d 257.\n\nPain, suffering and medical expenses included.— Personal representative of decedent, who was the administratrix of decedent's estate, could recover, under Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978] for decedent's conscious pain and suffering and medical and related care between the injury and death.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1969-NMCA-118, 81 N.M. 69, 463 P.2d 45,aff'd, 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nFactors to be considered in determining the monetary value of a decedent's life.— Where plaintiff, as personal representative of the estate of the deceased patient, brought an action against the United States for medical negligence and wrongful death arising under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and where the court found that the patient was treated by a physician employed by the United States and was acting within the scope and course of her employment, that the physician fell below the standard of care by removing the patient from anticoagulation medication even though the patient had a high risk for developing blood clots, and that the patient subsequently suffered ischemic stroke and died, the court awarded the full amount of damages under New Mexico law in the amount of $600,000, taking into consideration the decedent's include age, earning capacity, health, habits, life expectancy, and pain and suffering experienced between the time of injury and death.Nez v. United States, 367 F. Supp. 3d 1245 (D. N.M. 2019).\n\nPer accident coverage limitation.— The several statutory beneficiaries in a wrongful death action are entitled to recover, pursuant to underinsured motorist insurance policies, the per-person rather than the per-accident limits of coverage for underinsured motorist benefits.Lewis v. Dairyland Ins. Co., 1992-NMSC-031, 113 N.M. 686, 831 P.2d 985.\n\nVII. ATTORNEY DUTIES TO BENEFICIARIES.\n\nAttorney owes duty to statutory beneficiaries.— An attorney handling a wrongful death case owes to the statutory beneficiaries of that action a duty of reasonable care to protect their interests in receiving any proceeds obtained.Leyba v. Whitley, 1995-NMSC-066, 120 N.M. 768, 907 P.2d 172.\n\nAttorney's duty to resolve conflicts according to professional standards.— Where the attorney represented the client as the personal representative of the wrongful death estates of the client's child and grandchild who had been killed in a collision between the client's car and a truck; the client claimed that the non-client, who was a statutory beneficiary and the parent of the client's child, had abandoned the child and was not entitled to any of the wrongful death proceeds; the attorney knew that the client had been drinking alcohol before the collision and that the collision occurred when the client stopped the client's car in a traffic lane of an interstate highway at night with the car lights off; the attorney negotiated a settlement agreement with the non-client that substantially reduced the non-client's entitlement to the wrongful death proceeds; the attorney told the non-client that the attorney did not represent the non-client, the attorney represented only the client, and the attorney was not providing services to the non-client; there was a dispute as to whether the attorney informed the non-client that the client challenged the non-client's right to receive any of the wrongful death proceeds; the attorney did not tell the non-client the size of the anticipated settlement, that the attorney represented the client against the non-client, or that the non-client was entitled to fifty percent of the wrongful death proceeds; and the non-client sued the attorney for malpractice, fraud, collusion and misrepresentation, summary judgment for the attorney was not appropriate because there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the attorney had a conflict of interest in representing the personal representative who was potentially liable for the decedents' deaths and whether the attorney handled the conflict of interest between the client and non-client with due care and skill without harming the statutory beneficiary and because the non-client's independent tort claims were not barred by the adversarial exception.Spencer v. Barber, 2013-NMSC-010, 299 P.3d 388,rev'g2011-NMCA-090, 150 N.M. 519, 263 P.3d 296.\n\nAdversarial exception to attorney's duty to statutory beneficiaries.— The adversarial exception to an attorney's implied duty to pursue a wrongful death case for the benefit of a non-client statutory beneficiary applies when there is a conflict of interest or a breach of confidence between the client and the non-client statutory beneficiary. Even if an attorney identifies an actual or potential conflict, the attorney continues to owe a duty to the non-client statutory beneficiary unless the non-client statutory beneficiary knows or should know that the non-client statutory beneficiary cannot rely on the attorney to act for the non-client statutory beneficiary's benefit. If an attorney identifies a conflict between the attorney's client and a non-client statutory beneficiary, the attorney should give notice to the non-client statutory beneficiary that the non-client statutory beneficiary cannot rely on the attorney to act for the non-client statutory beneficiary's benefit and then the adversarial exception negates the duty owed by the non-client statutory beneficiary.Spencer v. Barber, 2011-NMCA-090, 150 N.M. 519, 263 P.3d 296, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 904.\n\nAdversarial exception applies to contract and tort-based malpractice claims.— The adversarial exception to the implied duty owed by an attorney to non-client statutory beneficiaries applies to both contract-based and tort-based claims of malpractice against the attorney.Spencer v. Barber, 2011-NMCA-090, 150 N.M. 519, 263 P.3d 296, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 904.\n\nAdversarial exception to attorney's duty to statutory beneficiaries.— Where the attorney filed a wrongful death action for the estate of the client's child and grandchild; the client took the position that the non-client, who was the surviving parent of the grandchild, had abandoned the grandchild and was not entitled to recover from the wrongful death estates; before the attorney accepted any offer of settlement from the tortfeasors, the attorney met with the non-client to settle any claims of the non-client to the wrongful death estates; the attorney told the non-client and the non-client understood that the attorney did not represent the non-client, the attorney represented only the client, and the attorney was not providing services to the non-client; and the non-client negotiated with the attorney to obtain a better settlement than the attorney offered, any implied duties that the attorney owed to the non-client ended when the adversarial relationship developed between the client and the non-client regarding the non-client's right to recover from the wrongful death estates.Spencer v. Barber, 2011-NMCA-090, 150 N.M. 519, 263 P.3d 296, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 904.\n\nLaw reviews.— For comment, \"Attractive Nuisance - Liability of the United States for Accidental Drowning of Infant Trespassers in Middle Rio Grande Project Irrigation Ditches,\" see 10 Nat.

      "text": "Every action instituted by virtue of the provisions of this and the preceding section [41-2-1 NMSA 1978] must be brought within three years after the cause of action accrues. The cause of action accrues as of the date of death.\n\nHistory:Laws 1882, ch. 61, § 9; C.L. 1884, § 2316; Code 1915, § 1822; C.S. 1929, § 36-103; 1941 Comp., § 24-102; Laws 1953, ch. 30, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 22-20-2; Laws 1961, ch. 202, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 1887, ch. 2, § 7, repealed §§ 2315, 2316, 1884 Comp. Both the 1887 act and § 2315 related to injuries to livestock by railroads. Laws 1889, ch. 75, repealed the act of 1887 in its entirety including its repealing clause.In Gallegos v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry., 1923-NMSC-032, 28 N.M. 472, 214 P. 579, the latter repeal was held to have revived this section, and the court incidentally also held that this section applies to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1915 Code compilers substituted \"this and the preceding section\" for \"this act.\" Laws 1882, ch. 61, is presently compiled as 41-2-1 to 41-2-4 and 30-32-4 NMSA 1978.\n\n1953 amendment prospective only.— If decedent dies in 1952 while one year period for bringing suit is in effect, that one year limitation governs, and not the 1953 amendment of three years, which is prospective only.Wall v. Gillett, 1956-NMSC-060, 61 N.M. 256, 298 P.2d 939.\n\nScope of 1961 amendment.— The 1961 amendment simply provides that the limitation period begins running, as to the personal representative's cause of action, upon the death of the injured person.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nEffect of 1961 amendment.— The 1961 amendment did not change the character of this section as a survival statute.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1969-NMCA-118, 81 N.M. 69, 463 P.2d 45,aff'd, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nEffect of reviving repealed section.— This section, although specifically repealed by Laws 1887, ch. 2, § 7, was revived by Laws 1889, ch. 75, which repealed the latter act. The fact that § 5426, 1915 Code, prohibits such revivor unless so provided did not affect the instant action for damages, which was brought before the latter law went into effect.Gallegos v. Atchinson, T. & S.F. Ry. Co., 1923-NMSC-032, 28 N.M. 472, 214 P. 579.\n\nNature of wrongful death provisions.— New Mexico Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978] creates a cause of action which did not exist at common law and the limitation provisions thereof are not only a limitation on the remedy, but also on the right to institute such an action.Perry v. Staver, 1970-NMCA-096, 81 N.M. 766, 473 P.2d 380.\n\nLimitation.— The limitation provision applicable to actions for wrongful death is not only a limitation on the remedy but also on the right to institute such action.Wall v. Gillett, 1956-NMSC-060, 61 N.M. 256, 298 P.2d 939.\n\nWhen cause of action arises.— Section 41-2-1 NMSA 1978 is a survival statute under which the cause of action arises at time of death.State ex rel. De Moss v. Dist. Court, 1951-NMSC-010, 55 N.M. 135, 227 P.2d 937.\n\nThe second sentence of this section provides for a specific date on which a cause of action accrues.Clark v. Lovelace Health Sys., Inc., 2004-NMCA-119, 136 N.M. 411, 99 P.3d 232.\n\nEffect of statute of limitations.— Not only the remedy but the right to maintain suit was barred where damages were sought for wrongful death on account of alleged negligence of relator in performing surgery on decedent and complaint was filed more than one year (now three years) after death occurred.State ex rel. De Moss v. Dist. Court, 1951-NMSC-010, 55 N.M. 135, 227 P.2d 937.\n\nEffective date of statute.— The statute of limitations in effect at the time of death governed the right to prosecute a wrongful death action and the defendant was exempt from all claims after the expiration of the time fixed.Wall v. Gillett, 1956-NMSC-060, 61 N.M. 256, 298 P.2d 939.\n\nLimitation period for claim of malpractice resulting in wrongful death.— The specific inclusion of a wrongful death claim within the definition of a malpractice claim makes the limitation period of 41-5-13 NMSA 1978 applicable to a claim of malpractice resulting in wrongful death.Armijo v. Tandysh, 1981-NMCA-098, 98 N.M. 181, 646 P.2d 1245, cert. quashed, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794 (1982), and cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1016, 103 S. Ct. 377, 74 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1982),overruled on other grounds byRoberts v. SW Cmty. Health Servs., 1992-NMSC-042, 114 N.M. 248, 837 P.2d 442;Mackey v. Burke, 1984-NMCA-028, 102 N.M. 294, 694 P.2d 1359,overruled byChavez v. Regents of Univ. of N.M., 1985-NMSC-114, 103 N.M. 606, 711 P.2d 883.\n\nDifferent periods are not equal protection violation.— There is no equal protection violation because a wrongful death claim based on malpractice has a limitation period different from a wrongful death claim which does not involve malpractice.Armijo v. Tandysh, 1981-NMCA-098, 98 N.M. 181, 646 P.2d 1245, cert. quashed, 98 N.M. 336, 648 P.2d 794 (1982), and cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1016, 103 S. Ct. 377, 74 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1982),overruled on other grounds byRoberts v. SW Cmty. Health Servs., 1992-NMSC-042, 114 N.M. 248, 837 P.2d 442.\n\nThe doctrine of fraudulent concealment applies to toll the limitations period.— It is consistent with the purpose of the Wrongful Death Act (WDA) to toll the statutory limitations period where a defendant has fraudulently concealed the cause of action, and therefore when the appropriate showing is made, the common law doctrine of fraudulent concealment applies to an action under the WDA. To toll a statutory limitations period under the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant knew of the alleged wrongful act and concealed it from the plaintiff or had material information pertinent to its discovery which he failed to disclose, and the plaintiff did not know, or could not have known through the exercise of reasonable diligence, of the cause of action within the statutory period. If the plaintiff meets the burden of proof and the doctrine tolls the statutory limitations period, the statute commences to run again when the plaintiff discovers, or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the cause of action.Estate of Brice v. Toyota Motor Corp., 2016-NMSC-018,overrulingPerry v. Staver, 1970-NMCA-096, 473 P.2d 380 andClark v. Lovelace Health Systems, Inc., 2004-NMCA-119, 99 P.3d 232.\n\nWhere defendants were aware of a sudden acceleration problem in their vehicles for many years preceding the accident which killed decedent, and where defendants prevented plaintiff from obtaining knowledge about the cause of action and fraudulently concealed the sudden acceleration problems until the problems drew public attention several years after the accident, the doctrine of fraudulent concealment served to toll the statutory limitations period for plaintiffs' cause of action under the Wrongful Death Act.Estate of Brice v. Toyota Motor Corp., 2016-NMSC-018,overrulingPerry v. Staver, 1970-NMCA-096, 473 P.2d 380 andClark v. Lovelace Health Systems, Inc., 2004-NMCA-119, 99 P.3d 232.\n\nTolling provisions in Medical Malpractice Act inapplicable.— The tolling provisions applicable to minors under the age of nine years contained in 41-5-13 NMSA 1978 (the Medical Malpractice Act) apply only to minors who suffer an alleged act of malpractice and not to minors who are beneficiaries under the Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978].Moncor Trust Co. ex rel. Flynn v. Feil, 1987-NMCA-015, 105 N.M. 444, 733 P.2d 1327, cert. denied, 105 N.M. 421, 733 P.2d 869.\n\nChoice of law.— Where torts are committed beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the sovereignty in which the action is brought, the lex fori governs, no matter whether the right of action depends upon the common law or a local statute, unless the statute creating or conferring the right limits the duration of such right to a prescribed time.Munos v. Southern Pac. Co., 51 F. 188 (5th Cir. 1892).\n\nEffect on amount of damages.— The 1961 amendment made no change in the damages the personal representative might recover, since it did no more than change the time when the limitation period begins to run against the personal representative's cause of action.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1969-NMCA-118, 81 N.M. 69, 463 P.2d 45,aff'd, 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nDiscovery.— The legislature has not felt it necessary to amend the language of the Wrongful Death Statute to allow for application of a discovery rule.Clark v. Lovelace Health Systems, Inc., 2004-NMCA-119, 136 N.M. 411, 99 P.3d 232.\n\nThis section and Section 37-1-11 NMSA 1978 contrasted.— Section 37-1-11 NMSA 1978 would allow the bringing of suit within one year from the date of death of an incompetent, provided the injury sued upon did not result in death, but if suit is brought under the Wrongful Death Act, the action must be commenced within three years of the accrual of the cause of the action.Kilkenny v. Kenney, 1961-NMSC-019, 68 N.M. 266, 361 P.2d 149 (decided prior to 1961 amendment).\n\nThis section and Section 37-1-11 NMSA 1978 contrasted.— Section 37-1-11 NMSA 1978 would allow the bringing of suit within one year from the date of death of an incompetent, provided the injury sued upon did not result in death, but if suit is brought under the Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978], the action must be commenced within three years of the accrual of the cause of the action.Kilkenny v. Kenney, 1961-NMSC-019, 68 N.M. 266, 361 P.2d 149 (decided prior to 1961 amendment).\n\nInapplicability of statute permitting continuation.— Provision of 37-1-14 NMSA 1978 permitting continuation after failure of first action is inapplicable to this section.Perry v. Staver, 1970-NMCA-096, 81 N.M. 766, 473 P.2d 380.\n\nEstoppel.— Estoppel cannot successfully be asserted to lengthen the period for recovery under this section, since this cause of action is created by statute.Perry v. Staver, 1970-NMCA-096, 81 N.M. 766, 473 P.2d 380.\n\nWhere appeal does not lie.— In a wrongful death action, appeal does not lie from an order of the court which does not dispose of the merits of the case, but merely overrules a motion to strike out part of defendant's answer setting up certain defenses, such as statute of limitations, fellow servant rule and joint venture.Burns v. Fleming, 1944-NMSC-006, 48 N.M. 40, 145 P.2d 861.\n\nLaw reviews.— For survey, \"The Statute of Limitations in Medical Malpractice Actions,\" see 6 N.M.L. Rev. 271 (1976).\n\nAm.

      "text": "Every action mentioned in Section 41-2-1 NMSA 1978 shall be brought by and in the name of the personal representative of the deceased person, and the jury in every such action may give such damages, compensatory and exemplary, as they deem fair and just, taking into consideration the pecuniary injury resulting from the death to the surviving party entitled to the judgment, or any interest in the judgment, recovered in such action and also having regard to the mitigating or aggravating circumstances attending the wrongful act, neglect or default. The proceeds of any judgment obtained in any such action shall not be liable for any debt of the deceased; provided the decedent has left a spouse, child, father, mother, brother, sister or child or children of the deceased child, as defined in the New Mexico Probate Code [Chapter 45 NMSA 1978], but shall be distributed as follows:\n\nA. if there is a surviving spouse and no child, then to the spouse;\n\nB. if there is a surviving spouse and a child or grandchild, then one-half to the surviving spouse and the remaining one-half to the children and grandchildren, the grandchildren taking by right of representation;\n\nC. if there is no husband or wife, but a child or grandchild, then to such child and grandchild by right of representation;\n\nD. if the deceased is a minor, childless and unmarried, then to the father and mother who shall have an equal interest in the judgment, or if either of them is dead, then to the survivor;\n\nE. if there is no father, mother, husband, wife, child or grandchild, then to a surviving brother or sister if there are any; and\n\nF. if there is no kindred as named in Subsections A through E of this section, then the proceeds of the judgment shall be disposed of in the manner authorized by law for the disposition of the personal property of deceased persons.\n\nHistory:Laws 1882, ch. 61, § 3; C.L. 1884, § 2310; Laws 1891, ch. 49, § 2; C.L. 1897, § 3215; Code 1915, § 1823; C.S. 1929, § 36-104; Laws 1939, ch. 105, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 24-103; 1953 Comp., § 22-20-3; Laws 2001, ch. 130, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For definitions under the Uniform Probate Code,see45-1-201 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, added the section heading; updated the internal reference at the beginning of the subsection; added Subsection designations A to F; substituted \"spouse\" for \"husband or wife\" throughout the section; inserted \"as defined in the New Mexico Probate Code\" following \"deceased child,\" in the preliminary language; rewrote Subsection B, which read \"if there be a surviving husband or wife and child or children or grandchildren, then equally to each\"; and made stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nSeptember 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001.— The economic loss award for the decedent from the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 should be distributed in the same manner as proceeds from an award in a wrongful death action.Marchand v. Marchand, 2007-NMCA-138, 142 N.M. 795, 171 P.3d 309,aff'd in part, rev'd on other grounds,2008-NMSC-065, 145 N.M. 378, 199 P.3d 281, cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 2386, 173 L. Ed 2d 1294 (2009).\n\nThe amount of collateral benefits assigned to each beneficiary of a September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 award should be applied against each beneficiary's share of the award for economic loss, thereby offsetting each beneficiary's share in proportion to the collateral benefits each beneficiary has received.Marchand v. Marchand, 2008-NMSC-065, 145 N.M. 378, 199 P.3d 281,rev'g, in part2007-NMCA-138, 142 N.M.795, 171 P.3d 309, cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 2386, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1294 (2009).\n\nWhere the total award from the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 for economic loss was $1,397,970; the spouse of the victim received $1,012,321 in collateral benefits, and the victim was survived by one child, the spouse's one-half share of the award for economic loss should be reduced by the amount of the collateral benefits that the spouse received, which eliminated any award for economic loss to the spouse.Marchand v. Marchand, 2008-NMSC-065, 145 N.M. 378, 199 P.3d 281,rev'g, in part2007-NMCA-138, 142 N.M. 795, 171 P.3d 309, cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 2386, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1294 (2009).\n\nDecedent's arbitration agreement is binding on estate and heirs.— Because a wrongful death action is derivative of the decedent's right to sue, a valid arbitration agreement signed by the decedent binds the decedent's estate and statutory heirs in a subsequent wrongful death action.Peck v. Laurel Healthcare Providers, L.L.C., 2014-NMCA-001, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nWhere the decedent's attorney-in-fact signed an admission agreement on behalf of the decedent when the decedent was admitted to defendant's nursing home; the agreement contained an arbitration agreement that bound the decedent and the decedent's representatives, successors, family, heirs and personal representatives to arbitrate disputes related to the agreement and the provision of services under the agreement; the decedent died five months after being admitted to the nursing home; plaintiff, who was the personal representative of the decedent's wrongful death estate, filed a wrongful death action against defendant alleging that the decedent died as a result of defendant's poor care of the decedent; and defendant sought to compel arbitration of the decedent's claims, plaintiff was bound by the agreement to arbitrate the decedent's claims because the decedent was bound by the agreement to arbitrate the decedent's claims against defendant.Peck v. Laurel Healthcare Providers, L.L.C., 2014-NMCA-001, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nPurpose of act.— The legislative purpose of this act (41-2-1 through 41-2-4 NMSA 1978) was not merely to provide compensation, but also to make negligence causing death costly to the wrongdoer.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1969-NMCA-118, 81 N.M. 69, 463 P.2d 45,aff'd, 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nThe authority to recover damages for wrongful death granted by statute has for its purpose more than compensation. It is designed as well to promote the safety of life and limb by making it costly for the wrongdoer.Tauch v. Ferguson-Steere Motor Co., 1957-NMSC-039, 62 N.M. 429, 312 P.2d 83.\n\nChoice of law to be that of state where tort occurred.— Where the tort and death occurred in a state which was not the domicile of the decedent or of any of the potential beneficiaries of the wrongful death claim, in the absence of compelling reasons to apply the law of another state, the law governing the apportionment of proceeds was that of the state where the tort and death occurred.In re. Estate of Gilmore, 1997-NMCA-103, 124 N.M. 119, 946 P.2d 1130.\n\nEffect of limitation provisions.— This act creates a cause of action which did not exist at common law and the limitation provisions thereof are not only a limitation on the remedy, but also on the right to institute such an action.Perry v. Staver, 1970-NMCA-096, 81 N.M. 766, 473 P.2d 380.\n\nEffect on common-law remedies.— The Wrongful Death Act does not apply to common-law remedies that existed prior to the act and which were not repealed; therefore, the statute of limitations applicable to the wrongful death action is not applicable to the husband's common-law right of action for loss of consortium.Kilkenny v. Kenney, 1961-NMSC-019, 68 N.M. 266, 361 P.2d 149.\n\nNo intent to change common-law rule on master's liability.— The legislature did not intend to change the common-law rule exempting a master from liability to a servant for the negligence of a fellow servant. Lutz v. Atlantic & Pac. Ry., 1892-NMSC-017, 6 N.M. 496, 30 P. 912, 16 L.R.A. 819 (1892).\n\nEffect on death by common carriers.— This section refers to death caused by the wrongful act of persons and corporations other than common carriers, as embraced in 41-2-4 NMSA 1978.Romero v. Atchison, T & S.F. Ry., 1903-NMSC-008, 11 N.M. 679, 72 P. 37;Mallory v. Pioneer S.W. Stages, Inc., 54 F.2d 559 (10th Cir. 1931).\n\nRecovery.— This section permits recovery by someone other than a statutory beneficiary, and recovery may be had even though there is no pecuniary injury to a statutory beneficiary. Damages are recoverable by proof of the worth of the life of the decedent, even though there is no kin to receive the award.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nSection permits recovery by someone other than statutory beneficiary. Recovery of substantial damages may be had even though there is no pecuniary injury to a statutory beneficiary; recovery is authorized for pain and suffering and for medical and related care between injury and death the same as could be recovered by an injured party who did not die.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nSection repealed to extent it prevents hospitals from asserting lien against wrongful death proceeds.— The Wrongful Death Act was enacted in 1882; the Hospital Lien Act [Chapter 48, Article 8 NMSA 1978] was enacted in 1961. The relevant provisions of the two acts have not been amended. Therefore, in view of the inconsistency between this section and 48-8-1, Subsection A NMSA 1978, the relevant provision of this section of the Wrongful Death Act is implicitly repealed to the extent it would prevent a hospital from asserting a lien against the proceeds of a wrongful death action. Moreover, the Hospital Lien Act specifically allows satisfaction of the decedent's hospital debt out of proceeds of an action brought by the decedent's personal representative, and this specific provision qualifies the general prohibition in the Wrongful Death Act against using proceeds from a wrongful death action to satisfy the debts of the deceased.Hall v. Regents of Univ. of N.M., 1987-NMSC-069, 106 N.M. 167, 740 P.2d 1151.\n\nApplicable section for loss of consortium.— Section 37-1-8 NMSA 1978 is the applicable section for an action brought by husband for loss of consortium, and this cause of action should be filed within three years from the date of the injury.Kilkenny v. Kenney, 1961-NMSC-019, 68 N.M. 266, 361 P.2d 149.\n\nNonviable fetus not a \"person.\"— A fetus that was nonviable, incapable of sustaining life outside the mother's womb, at the time of injury in a motor vehicle accident was not a \"person\" under Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978].Miller v. Kirk, 1995-NMSC-067, 120 N.M. 654, 905 P.2d 194.\n\nRelationship of suit to estate.— Wrongful death suit under this act has no relation to the estate, it being incidental that a \"personal representative\" is named to bring suit and it is not because this would fall within his duties as such, but because someone must be named and our legislature has fixed upon him as the one to sue.Henkel v. Hood, 1945-NMSC-006, 49 N.M. 45, 156 P.2d 790.\n\nRecovery in negligence case.— Where child's parents were killed simultaneously when automobile in which mother was passenger and which was driven by the father collided against defendant's truck, plaintiff in action brought against the truck owner and truck driver for death of the mother for benefit of the minor son, was entitled to recover if negligence of defendant truck driver was proximate cause of accident and death or if negligence of the father and the truck driver combined to cause the accident, but not if negligence of the father as driver of the automobile was sole cause of accident and death.Trefzer v. Stiles, 1952-NMSC-044, 56 N.M. 296, 243 P.2d 605.\n\nEffect of contributory negligence.— Where the personal representative brings the action for the benefit of the statutory beneficiaries, not of the estate, and the statutory beneficiaries are entitled to the recovery, not as distributees of the estate, the contributory negligence of one of several beneficiaries defeats the right of recovery to the extent of that beneficiary's share in the judgment.Baca v. Baca, 1963-NMSC-043, 71 N.M. 468, 379 P.2d 765.\n\nContributory negligence not imputed.— In an action for wrongful death of child for benefit of the parents, contributory negligence of the child's mother, if any, would not be imputed as a matter of law to the father and prevent recovery by him.Baca v. Baca, 1963-NMSC-043, 71 N.M. 468, 379 P.2d 765.\n\nWrongful death action is transitoryand may be filed in any county in the state where both of the parties are nonresidents.State ex rel. Appelby v. Dist. Court of Fifth Judicial Dist., 1942-NMSC-046, 46 N.M. 376, 129 P.2d 338.\n\nWhen assertion of estoppel barred.— Upon the expiration of the three-year limitation period provided in 41-2-2 NMSA 1978, the right to maintain the suit for the alleged wrongful death of decedent terminated, or was thereafter barred. Estoppel cannot be successfully asserted to lengthen the existence of such a statutorily created right of recovery.Perry v. Staver, 1970-NMCA-096, 81 N.M. 766, 473 P.2d 380.\n\nChoice of law.— Wrongful death actions in New Mexico are governed by the doctrine of lex loci delicti, which states that the law of the place of wrong determines whether a person has sustained a legal injury.First Nat'l Bank v. Benson, 1976-NMCA-072, 89 N.M. 481, 553 P.2d 1288, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619.\n\nPresumption of due care.— Because the only eyewitness testimony of the collision was supplied by a passing truck driver who saw the car in which decedent was a passenger strike the rear end of defendants' truck-trailer, decedent would be presumed to have used due care for individual safety.Trefzer v. Stiles, 1952-NMSC-044, 56 N.M. 296, 243 P.2d 605, criticizedHartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Horne, 1959-NMSC-026, 65 N.M. 440, 338 P.2d 1067.\n\nEffect on truck operated as common carrier.— Action against an owner-driver operating truck as common carrier may be brought by the personal representative inasmuch as 41-2-4 NMSA 1978 prescribing who may sue and recover in suits for death caused by railroad, stage coach or public conveyance does not apply.White v. Montoya, 1942-NMSC-031, 46 N.M. 241, 126 P.2d 471.\n\nEffect on Indians.— The wrongful death statute applies to Indians on reservations, and the probate court may appoint an administrator for a deceased Indian to enforce an Indian's right of action under this statute.Trujillo v. Prince, 1938-NMSC-024, 42 N.M. 337, 78 P.2d 145.\n\nII. PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE.\n\nRepresentative as trustee.— The personal representative who makes a recovery serves as a trustee, a \"statutory trustee,\" for discoverable and identifiable beneficiaries in the line of named kinship or descent. The personal representative is also a trustee for the state and for estate creditors where none of the named kin are left, or the line of descent runs out.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nThe personal representative serves as a statutory trustee for discoverable and identifiable beneficiaries in the line of named kinship or descent.Baca v. Baca, 1963-NMSC-043, 71 N.M. 468, 379 P.2d 765.\n\nWrongful death action brought by a personal representative against a governmental entity is a single claim.— A personal representative, whether consisting of one or more individuals, is the \"person\" for purposes of Paragraph 3 of Subsection A of 41-4-19 NMSA 1978 of the Tort Claims Act because under the Wrongful Death Act, 41-2-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., the personal representative of the deceased person replaces the deceased person and has the sole right to pursue the action on behalf of the statutory beneficiaries. A wrongful death action brought by a personal representative on behalf of multiple statutory beneficiaries is a single claim under Paragraph 3 of Subsection A of 41-4-19 NMSA 1978, rather than multiple claims under Paragraph 4 of Subsection A of 41-4-19 NMSA 1978.Estate of Lajeuenesse v. UNM Bd. of Regents, 2013-NMCA-004, 292 P.3d 485, cert. quashed, 2013-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere the personal representative of the decedent sued defendants for the wrongful death of the decedent based on the negligent medical care provided by defendants; no claims were made by any person other than the personal representative; and the jury awarded plaintiff damages of $750,000, the district court properly applied the monetary limitation of Paragraph 3 of Subsection A of 41-4-19 NMSA 1978, rather than multiple claims limitation under Paragraph 4 of Subsection A of 41-4-19 NMSA 1978, to reduce the verdict to $400,000 because the wrongful death action was a single claim, not multiple claims.Estate of Lajeuenesse v. UNM Bd. of Regents, 2013-NMCA-004, 292 P.3d 485, cert. quashed, 2013-NMCERT-001.\n\nSharing damages with personal representative barred.— While the wrongful death action is brought by the personal representative, the personal representative does not share in any damages recovered.Lujan v. Gonzales, 1972-NMCA-098, 84 N.M. 229, 501 P.2d 673, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 219, 501 P.2d 663.\n\nWho may sue.— An action may be brought only by the personal representative or representatives of the deceased.Kilkenny v. Kenney, 1961-NMSC-019, 68 N.M. 266, 361 P.2d 149;Mackey v. Burke, 1984-NMCA-028, 102 N.M. 294, 694 P.2d 1359, cert. quashed, 102 N.M. 293, 694 P.2d 1358 (1985).\n\nPersonal representative may be appointed after the filing of a wrongful death complaint. — The appointment of the personal representative is not jurisdictional and any mistake or failure to appoint a personal representative can be resolved by amendment under 1-015 NMRA and substitution of the appropriate real party in interest under 1-017(A) NMRA.Lopez v. Presbyterian Healthcare, 2024-NMCA-055, cert. granted.\n\nThe appointment of a personal representative after a wrongful death act complaint has been filed is not a jurisdictional defect requiring dismissal of the action.— Where plaintiffs filed a wrongful death action against defendants, but did not seek the appointment of a personal representative under the Wrongful Death Act (WDA), 41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978, until months into the litigation, and where the district court determined that plaintiffs' late request to appoint a personal representative deprived the court of jurisdiction over the wrongful death action and dismissed the wrongful death claim with prejudice, the district court erred in dismissing the case, because although the WDA is a purely statutory cause of action for which standing is a jurisdictional prerequisite, the personal representative brings the action on behalf of the deceased injured person and acts for the benefit of the statutory beneficiaries, but the WDA does not require a personal representative to demonstrate an actual injury to themselves in order to establish a cause of action, and therefore the appointment of a personal representative is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to establish statutory standing or a cause of action under the WDA. The appointment of a personal representative is not jurisdictional and 1-015 NMRA and 1-017 NMRA may operate to correct and relate back any appointment errors.Lopez v. Presbyterian Healthcare, 2024-NMCA-055, cert. granted.\n\nParents were not statutory beneficiaries with standing to nominate the personal representative.— Where respondents, parents of decedent, challenged the appointment of petitioner as the personal representative of the wrongful death estate of decedent, pursuant to the Wrongful Death Act (WDA), 41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978, and where the district court removed petitioner as the personal representative, finding that respondents were statutory beneficiaries under the WDA with authority to designate the personal representative, the district court erred in finding that respondents had standing to nominate the WDA personal representative on the basis that respondents were statutory beneficiaries, because 41-2-3(A) NMSA 1978 through 41-2-3(E) NMSA 1978 does not provide for respondents, as the parents of an adult child, to recover as statutory beneficiaries, and, as a result, respondents did not have priority as \"kindred\" in 41-2-3(F) NMSA 1978.In re Estate of Golden, 2024-NMCA-048, cert. denied.\n\nDistrict court abused its discretion in reinstating claims settled by personal representative.— Where personal representative of decedent's estate (probate PR) filed a 2012 lawsuit against medical practice and decedent's doctor claiming negligence, medical malpractice, and wrongful death, and where in 2013, the probate PR entered into a settlement agreement with decedent's doctor, resulting in a district court order dismissing all claims against the doctor with prejudice, and where, in 2015, upon plaintiff's motion, the district court entered an order reinstating the claims against the doctor, claiming that the probate PR, by failing to be appointed as the personal representative for purposes of the Wrongful Death Act, lacked authority to file and settle the claims against the doctor, the district court abused its discretion in granting plaintiff's motion to set aside the settlement and reinstate claims against the doctor under Rule 1-060(B)(6) NMRA, because the law in effect at the time did not require that a court-appointed probate PR obtain a separate court appointment as a personal representative for wrongful death purposes, and the district court based its reinstatement of the claims on an erroneous interpretation of the law.Oakey v. Tyson, 2017-NMCA-078, cert. granted.\n\nIII. BENEFICIARIES.\n\nProof of natural-parent status is not necessarily sufficient for recoveryunder the wrongful death statute; a personal representative in a wrongful death action may present evidence of abandonment and non-support, and even seek to terminate parental rights, particularly in light of the fact that the only remaining one is a right to recover money.Perry v. Williams, 2003-NMCA-084, 133 N.M. 844, 70 P.3d 1283, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 123, 73 P.3d 826.\n\nThe legislature intended to incorporate the common law principal that the rights of parents and children are interlocked, and that a parent may lose his or her right to benefit from a child if that parent abandons the child, into the Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978] when it was passed.Perry v. Williams, 2003-NMCA-084, 133 N.M. 844, 70 P.3d 1283, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 123, 73 P.3d 826.\n\nAttorney's duty to statutory beneficiaries.— The Rules of Professional Conduct are relevant in determining the scope of the duty owed by an attorney to the personal representative of a wrongful death estate and how a breach of that duty may have harmed the statutory beneficiaries. Statutory beneficiaries are intended beneficiaries of the agreement between the attorney and the personal representative and the statutory beneficiaries may sue the attorney when the attorney's breach of the duty to the personal representative to exercise reasonable skill and care during the attorney's representation harms the statutory beneficiaries.Spencer v. Barber, 2013-NMSC-010, 299 P.3d 388,rev'g2011-NMCA-090, 150 N.M. 519, 263 P.3d 296.\n\nAttorneys' duty of disclosure to statutory beneficiaries.— When the interests of the personal representative and a statutory beneficiary are adverse, the attorney for the personal representative may negotiate a settlement between the personal representative and the statutory beneficiary after the attorney discloses to the statutory beneficiary that (1) the beneficiary is a beneficiary in a wrongful death lawsuit and the identities of the parties to the lawsuit, (2) the amount of any settlement or verdict reached, or any settlement offers under consideration, (3) the percentage of the settlement or verdict to which the beneficiary is entitled under the statute, (4) the basic position of the adverse party, and (5) the fact that the attorney represents the adverse party against the beneficiary and is not looking out for the beneficiary's interests.Spencer v. Barber, 2013-NMSC-010, 299 P.3d 388,rev'g2011-NMCA-090, 150 N.M. 519, 263 P.3d 296.\n\nAttorney's duty to resolve conflicts according to professional standards.— Where the attorney represented the client as the personal representative of the wrongful death estates of the client's child and grandchild who had been killed in a collision between the client's car and a truck; the client claimed that the non-client, who was a statutory beneficiary and the parent of the client's child, had abandoned the child and was not entitled to any of the wrongful death proceeds; the attorney knew that the client had been drinking alcohol before the collision and that the collision occurred when the client stopped the client's car in a traffic lane of an interstate highway at night with the car lights off; the attorney negotiated a settlement agreement with the non-client that substantially reduced the non-client's entitlement to the wrongful death proceeds; the attorney told the non-client that the attorney did not represent the non-client, the attorney represented only the client, and the attorney was not providing services to the non-client; there was a dispute as to whether the attorney informed the non-client that the client challenged the non-client's right to receive any of the wrongful death proceeds; the attorney did not tell the non-client the size of the anticipated settlement, that the attorney represented the client against the non-client, or that the non-client was entitled to fifty percent of the wrongful death proceeds; and the non-client sued the attorney for malpractice, fraud, collusion and misrepresentation, summary judgment for the attorney was not appropriate because there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the attorney had a conflict of interest in representing the personal representative who was potentially liable for the decedents' deaths and whether the attorney handled the conflict of interest between the client and non-client with due care and skill without harming the statutory beneficiary and because the non-client's independent tort claims were not barred by the adversarial exception.Spencer v. Barber, 2013-NMSC-010, 299 P.3d 388,rev'g2011-NMCA-090, 150 N.M. 519, 263 P.3d 296.\n\nAttorney owes duty to statutory beneficiaries.— An attorney handling a wrongful death case owes to the statutory beneficiaries of that action a duty of reasonable care to protect their interests in receiving any proceeds obtained.Leyba v. Whitley, 1995-NMSC-066, 120 N.M. 768, 907 P.2d 172.\n\nWho may sue.— This section does not give an alleged natural father the unconditional right to intervene in an action for the wrongful death of his daughter.Dominguez v. Rogers, 1983-NMCA-135, 100 N.M. 605, 673 P.2d 1338,cert. denied, sub. nom.Sosa v. Dominguez, 100 N.M. 689, 675 P.2d 421.\n\nThe act furnishes the basis for recovery, by the statutory beneficiaries, of the decedent's damages; but it provides no basis for recovery by the decedent's parents, or anyone else, of their own damages flowing from the loss of the decedent's life.Solon ex rel. Ponce v. WEK Drilling Co., Inc., 1992-NMSC-023, 113 N.M. 566, 829 P.2d 645.\n\nPer accident coverage limitation.— The several statutory beneficiaries in a wrongful death action are entitled to recover. Pursuant to underinsured motorist insurance policies, the per-person rather than the per-accident limits of coverage for underinsured motorist benefits applies.Lewis v. Dairyland Ins. Co., 1992-NMSC-031, 113 N.M. 686, 831 P.2d 985.\n\nUse of \"personal representative\" not same as in Probate Code.— \"Personal representative\" for the purpose of a wrongful death action is not synonymous with the parameters of the Probate Code, 45-1-101 NMSA 1978 et seq.Mackey v. Burke, 1984-NMCA-028, 102 N.M. 294, 694 P.2d 1359,cert. quashed, 102 N.M. 293, 694 P.2d 1358 (1985).\n\nAdministrator and personal representative distinguished.— While the administrator may be the personal representative, there may be a personal representative who is not the administrator.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1969-NMCA-118, 81 N.M. 69, 463 P.2d 45,aff'd, 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nComplaint amendable to include proper plaintiff.— The personal representative of the deceased should have been given a reasonable opportunity to amend to include himself as the plaintiff in a wrongful death complaint in which the deceased had been named as the plaintiff, since all of the earlier pleadings named the personal representative as the plaintiff.Jones v. 3M Co., 107 F.R.D. 202 (D.N.M. 1984).\n\nAmendment of action not brought in name of personal representative.— An action for malpractice and wrongful death brought under the Tort Claims Act by the natural parents of a deceased child within the limitation period was not barred because the parents failed to secure court appointment as personal representatives within the two-year limitation period of 41-4-15 NMSA 1978, due to the operation of Rules 15(c) (relation back of amendments) and 17(a) (real party in interest), N.M.R.C.P., (now see Paragraph C of Rule 1-015, NMRA and Paragraph A of Rule 1-017) NMRA.Chavez v. Regents of Univ. of N.M., 1985-NMSC-114, 103 N.M. 606, 711 P.2d 883.\n\nMexican administrator may be personal representative.— Plaintiff administrator, a Mexican national and an alien in the United States, had the right to serve as administrator of son's estate in the prosecution of wrongful death action, since the term \"personal representative\" in this section is used simply to designate the person who may prosecute the action.Torres v. Sierra, 1976-NMCA-064, 89 N.M. 441, 553 P.2d 721, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.\n\nAdministrator may file suit for damages for wrongful deathunder this section.Romero v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry., 1903-NMSC-008, 11 N.M. 679, 72 P. 37.\n\nWhether adult children emotionally support decedent-parent is immaterial to the distribution benefits.— In a dispute over the distribution of proceeds of an action brought under the Wrongful Death Act, where appellants claimed that the decedent's children had abandoned their father prior to his death and therefore should be denied some or all of the proceeds of the Wrongful Death Act claim, summary judgment in favor of decedent's children was proper because there is no New Mexico statutory authority indicating a public policy requiring adult children to support their parents, either financially or emotionally, and there is no statutory authority indicating that the legislature intended to alter the distribution scheme in the Wrongful Death Act based on adult children's abandonment of their decedent parent.Bodley v. Goldman, 2016-NMCA-054.\n\nOwnership of right of recovery.— Recovery under this statute belongs to the relative for whose benefit the suit is brought, and the right of recovery extends to those distributees named in the statute, or to those entitled under the laws of descent and distribution, in the same manner and to the same extent as is given to the wife and children of the decedent.Varney v. Taylor, 1968-NMSC-189, 79 N.M. 652, 448 P.2d 164.\n\nDistribution between parent and adult children.— A child shares equally with a widow in the wrongful death proceeds. The fact that two children are adults and not dependent on decedent does not bar them from a distributive share of the proceeds from the settlement of the wrongful death claim.Brock v. Harkins, 1969-NMCA-062, 80 N.M. 596, 458 P.2d 848, cert. denied, 80 N.M. 607, 458 P.2d 859.\n\nEvidence identifying beneficiaries not error.— It is not error to admit evidence identifying the decedent's wife and children as beneficiaries under the New Mexico Wrongful Death Act.Harris v. Illinois-California Express, Inc., 687 F.2d 1361 (10th Cir. 1982).\n\n\"Child\" not qualified term.— This section does not qualify the word \"child\" by the words \"minor\" or \"dependent.\"Brock v. Harkins, 1969-NMCA-062, 80 N.M. 596, 458 P.2d 848, cert. denied, 80 N.M. 607, 458 P.2d 859.\n\nAdoption prerequisite for wrongful death recovery by child.— Child who had not been legally adopted by decedent, and could not establish a basis for equitable adoption, could not recover in a wrongful death action based on the accident that killed decedent.Otero v. City of Albuquerque, 1998-NMCA-137, 125 N.M. 770, 965 P.2d 354.\n\nDeath of survivor of child.— In an action for a child's wrongful death in which the child, along with her mother, was severely burned by the explosion of a natural gas pipeline and died within hours of the explosion, the right of the mother, who survived the child's death but died thereafter from her own injuries, to share in the proceeds of the action became absolutely vested upon the child's death; upon the mother's death, her interest in the proceeds passed to her estate.In re Estate of Sumler, 2003-NMCA-030, 133 N.M. 319, 62 P.3d 776.\n\nConstruction of \"survivor\" that delays ascertainment of the identities of beneficiaries until a judgment is recovered is incompatible with this section.In re Estate of Sumler, 2003-NMCA-030, 133 N.M. 319, 62 P.3d 776.\n\nIV. DAMAGES.\n\nProceeds not part of estate.— The amount recovered under the wrongful death statute never becomes a part of the community or of the decedent's estate.Trefzer v. Stiles, 1952-NMSC-004, 56 N.M. 296, 243 P.2d 605.\n\nThe recovery under this act is not a part of decedent's estate.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1969-NMCA-118, 81 N.M. 69, 463 P.2d 45,aff'd, 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nProceeds not community property.— The right of action given the husband or wife to have an action brought for the wrongful death of a child is not a community right, and the proceeds from any recovery are not community property.Baca v. Baca, 1963-NMSC-043, 71 N.M. 468, 379 P.2d 765.\n\nInstructions as to damages.— Damages under the Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 to 41-2-4 NMSA 1978] are not merely compensatory of pecuniary loss to the survivors, and there is no error in the lower court's instructions on the measure of damages putting an emphasis upon the pecuniary value of the life taken to the survivors and in permitting the jury to consider the possible contributions to survivors and the expenditures which must be incurred during a lifetime, as well as the probable income of the deceased.Barnes v. Smith, 305 F.2d 226 (10th Cir. 1962).\n\nProof of pecuniary loss not required.— Even in absence of proof of pecuniary loss, damages may be awarded.Barnes v. Smith, 305 F.2d 226 (10th Cir. 1962).\n\nPecuniary injury not necessary for recovery.— Widow's pecuniary injury inured to the benefit of the nondependent children and the fact that the children did not suffer pecuniary injury does not bar them from a distributive share of the proceeds.Brock v. Harkins, 1969-NMCA-062, 80 N.M. 596, 458 P.2d 848, cert. denied, 80 N.M. 607, 458 P.2d 859.\n\nRecoverable damages implied.— Proof of wrongful death of necessity implies recoverable damages so that, even in the absence of pecuniary injury, question of damages in wrongful death action was properly submitted to jury.Baca v. Baca, 1970-NMCA-090, 81 N.M. 734, 472 P.2d 997.\n\nLoss of guidance and counseling by a minor child is a pecuniary injury.Romero v. Byers, 1994-NMSC-031, 117 N.M. 422, 872 P.2d 840.\n\nWorth of life.— Damages for wrongful death are recoverable by proof of the worth of the life of the decedent and the measure of those damages is the worth of life of decedent to the estate.Lujan v. Gonzales, 1972-NMCA-098, 84 N.M. 229, 501 P.2d 673, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 219, 501 P.2d 663.\n\nJury question.— Determination of present worth of life of deceased is for the jury, based upon proof as to age, earning capacity, health, habits and probable duration of life.Duncan v. Madrid, 1940-NMSC-027, 44 N.M. 249, 101 P.2d 382;Cerrillos Coal R.R. Co. v. Deserant, 1897-NMSC-005, 9 N.M. 49, 49 P. 807;Hogsett v. Hanna, 1936-NMSC-063, 41 N.M. 22, 63 P.2d 540;Mares v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Co., 1938-NMSC-032, 42 N.M. 473, 82 P.2d 257.\n\nLife valued as present worth.— Worth of life of deceased to estate is not all that the individual would earn in a lifetime, but the present worth, taking into consideration the earning power.Mares v. N.M. Pub. Serv. Co., 1938-NMSC-032, 42 N.M. 473, 82 P.2d 257.\n\nEarning power to be considered.— An award based entirely upon aggregate future benefits would amount to more than compensation unless the earning power of money was taken into account.Varney v. Taylor, 1966-NMSC-080, 77 N.M. 28, 419 P.2d 234.\n\nThe value of a husband's household serviceswas an evidentiary item admissible in establishing the present worth of the husband's life.Corlett v. Smith, 1988-NMCA-067, 107 N.M. 707, 763 P.2d 1172, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 610, 762 P.2d 867.\n\nUse of net income.— Net income is the more realistic basis for arriving at the equivalent to compensation for the deprivation of the reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefits that would have resulted from the continued life of deceased in a wrongful death action.Varney v. Taylor, 1966-NMSC-080, 77 N.M. 28, 419 P.2d 234.\n\nDeduction of personal living expenses.— Decedent's anticipated personal living expenses should be deducted from the amount otherwise determined as reasonable compensation for the deprivation of expected pecuniary benefits that would have resulted from the decedent's continued life. The term \"personal living expenses\" has never been exactly defined, and because of the nature of the problem, no mathematical formula can ever be applied. Each case must depend upon its own facts and circumstances, but personal expenses would not ordinarily include recreational expenses.Varney v. Taylor, 1968-NMSC-189, 79 N.M. 652, 448 P.2d 164.\n\nPain and medical expenses recoverable.— Recovery for decedent's pain and suffering and medical and related care from injury until death may be had by the personal representative, even though there is no statutory beneficiary.Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nRecovery of damages prior to death.— This section and 41-2-1 NMSA 1978 warrant the allowance, to the personal representative, of the decedent's damages prior to death, provided they are not the same as those for which the husband, individually, has a right of recovery.Kilkenny v. Kenney, 1961-NMSC-019, 68 N.M. 266, 361 P.2d 149;Stang v. Hertz Corp., 1970-NMSC-048, 81 N.M. 348, 467 P.2d 14.\n\nEstimating earnings between injury and death.— The net estimated earnings of decedent during the period from the date of death to the date of the judgment should be increased by the same discount rate applied to decrease the net income after judgment.Varney v. Taylor, 1968-NMSC-189, 79 N.M. 652, 448 P.2d 164.\n\nFuneral and burial expenses.— The funeral and burial expenses incurred by decedent's personal representatives are pecuniary injuries which are recoverable.Williams v. Town of Silver City, 1972-NMCA-132, 84 N.M. 279, 502 P.2d 304, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 271, 502 P.2d 296.\n\nEffect of taxes and retirement.— Federal and state income taxes and social security taxes are often substantial deductions from gross earnings and certainly are not a part of the decedent's income which the family could expect as direct pecuniary benefits nor should the other sources of employment which have compulsory retirement as after which, in the usual instance, the expected income from other than invested capital may reasonably be expected to be materially reduced.Varney v. Taylor, 1966-NMSC-080, 77 N.M. 28, 419 P.2d 234.\n\nConsideration of mitigating or aggravating circumstances.— In a wrongful death action in which the state was a defendant, an instruction allowing the jury to consider mitigating or aggravating circumstances in setting compensatory damages did not violate the prohibition on punitive damages contained in 41-4-19B (now 41-4-19D) NMSA 1978.Folz v. State, 1990-NMSC-075, 110 N.M. 457, 797 P.2d 246.\n\nPunitive damages are not availablefrom the estate of the wrongdoer, since the reason for their imposition can no longer be effective.Barnes v. Smith, 305 F.2d 226 (10th Cir. 1962).\n\nExpert testimony allowed on non-pecuniary value.— Because the value of life itself is compensable under the Wrongful Death Act the jury must determine fair and just compensation for the reasonable expected nonpecuniary rewards the deceased would have reaped from life as demonstrated by his or her health and habits. Admissibility of evidence directed at establishing this value is governed by the rules of evidence of the applicable trial court. However, plaintiffs may introduce expert testimony by an economist for establishing the value of life itself.Romero v. Byers, 1994-NMSC-031, 117 N.M. 422, 872 P.2d 840.\n\nSeveral beneficiaries.— If pecuniary injury is a requisite for recovery of damages for wrongful death, it is sufficient if one member of the same class of statutory beneficiaries suffers pecuniary injury. In such a case, the damages inure to every member of the same class.Brock v. Harkins, 1969-NMCA-062, 80 N.M. 596, 458 P.2d 848, cert. denied, 80 N.M. 607, 458 P.2d 859.\n\nAdmission of expenses held nonprejudicial.— Admission of evidence concerning ambulance, medical and burial expenses held nonprejudicial where there was no award in favor of either party plaintiff based on these expenses.Hodgkins v. Christopher, 1954-NMSC-089, 58 N.M. 637, 274 P.2d 153.\n\nTestimony about injuries resulting in death.— In spite of timely admission that death resulted from injuries received by accident in question, it was not an abuse of judicial discretion to permit the administrator of the estate of the decedent to introduce medical testimony as to injuries which resulted in the death.Hodgkins v. Christopher, 1954-NMSC-089, 58 N.M. 637, 274 P.2d 153.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Torts - Wrongful Death - A Viable Fetus Is a 'Person' Under the New Mexico Wrongful Death Statute:Salazar v.

In the event there are no such persons entitled to sue or in the event suit is not brought by any such persons within nine months after such death, suit may be brought by the personal representative or representatives of such deceased person.\n\nHistory:Laws 1882, ch. 61, § 1; C.L. 1884, § 2308; C.L. 1897, § 3213; Code 1915, § 1820; C.S. 1929, § 36-101; Laws 1931, ch. 19, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 24-104; Laws 1947, ch. 125, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 22-20-4; Laws 1955, ch. 270, § 1; 1973, ch. 138, § 13.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For limitation of actions,see41-2-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor railroad's liability for injuries to or death of employees,seeN.M. Const., art. XX, § 16.\n\nRepeal and revival of section.— In view of the fact that this section was repealed by Laws 1887, ch. 2, § 7, which in turn was repealed by Laws 1889, ch. 75, § 4, the rule of common law would be applied to revive this act, and make it again effective.Gallegos v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry., 1923-NMSC-032, 28 N.M. 472, 214 P. 579.\n\nSection is not unconstitutional for want of a taker under it.Tauch v. Ferguson-Steere Motor Co., 1957-NMSC-039, 62 N.M. 429, 312 P.2d 83.\n\nConstitutionality of denying recovery against employee.— It is not unconstitutionally discriminatory to deny a right of action for wrongful death against a negligent employee of a public conveyance, while granting the right against other negligent employees, under 41-2-1 NMSA 1978.Schloss v. Matteucci, 260 F.2d 16 (10th Cir. 1958).\n\nLegislative intent as to master-servant rule.— By enactment of statute authorizing recovery of damages for negligent death of persons by railroad company, its officers, agents or employees, the legislature did not intend to change the common-law rule exempting a master from liability to servant for negligence of fellow servant.Lutz v. Atlantic & Pac. Ry., 1892-NMSC-017, 6 N.M. 496, 30 P. 912, 16 L.R.A. 819 (1892).\n\nApplicability to airplane pilot.— In the case of an airplane the terminology is \"pilot,\" which means the same thing as \"driver\" for all practical as well as legislative purposes.In re Estate of Reilly, 1957-NMSC-095, 63 N.M. 352, 319 P.2d 1069.\n\nMeaning of \"locomotive,\" \"car\" and \"stage coach\".— The words \"locomotive,\" \"car\" and \"stage coach\" refer to and include quasi-public corporations and agencies engaged in serving the public in the transportation of passengers and goods.Cain v. Bowlby, 114 F.2d 519 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 311 U.S. 710, 61 S. Ct. 319, 85 L. Ed. 462 (1940).\n\nNature of wrongful death provisions.— New Mexico Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 through 41-2-4 NMSA 1978] creates a cause of action which did not exist at common law and the limitation provisions thereof are not only a limitation on the remedy, but also on the right to institute such an action.Perry v. Staver, 1970-NMCA-096, 81 N.M. 766, 473 P.2d 380.\n\nIntent of section.— The section is intended to protect life and to impose a new and extraordinary civil liability on those causing death by subjecting them to private actions for pecuniary damages resulting to family of deceased.Nichols v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry., 286 F. 1 (9th Cir. 1923),aff'd, 264 U.S. 348, 44 S. Ct. 353, 68 L. Ed. 720 (1924).\n\nMore than compensation contemplated.— The statutes allowing damages for wrongful act or neglect causing death have for their purpose more than compensation. It is intended by them, also, to promote safety of life and limb, by making negligence that causes death costly to the wrongdoer.Langham v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 1975-NMSC-064, 88 N.M. 516, 543 P.2d 484.\n\nStrict construction.— The Wrongful Death Act [41-2-1 through 41-2-4 NMSA 1978] is in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed.Cain v. Bowlby, 114 F.2d 519 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 311 U.S. 710, 61 S. Ct. 319, 85 L. Ed. 462 (1940).\n\nThough the New Mexico Wrongful Death Act, being in derogation of common law is to be construed strictly, the rule is applicable only in cases of doubtful meaning.Myers v. Pacific Greyhound Lines, 134 F.2d 457 (10th Cir. 1943).\n\nExclusivity of action.— Right of action for wrongful death caused by common carrier is exclusive of right of action for wrongful death caused by person or corporation other than common carriers.Mallory v. Pioneer S.W. Stages, Inc., 54 F.2d 559 (10th Cir. 1931).\n\nSuit against airplane pilot.— Administrator of the estate of one of deceased passengers of crashed airplane could not obtain a personal judgment against the pilot under 41-2-1 NMSA 1978 based on the pilot's alleged negligence as this section is the exclusive statutory remedy available to plaintiff.In re Estate of Reilly, 1957-NMSC-095, 63 N.M. 352, 319 P.2d 1069.\n\nRemedy is exclusive and an exception to the wrongful death statute.Tilly v. Flippin, 237 F.2d 364 (10th Cir. 1956);In re Estate of Reilly, 1957-NMSC-095, 63 N.M. 352, 319 P.2d 1069.\n\nRecovery against employer or owner only.— This section limits those from whom recovery may be had to the employer of the person whose negligence, unskillfulness or criminal intent in running, conducting, managing or driving the public conveyance caused or occasioned death to the \"owner\" of the public conveyance, which does not include an airplane manufacturer.Langham v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 1975-NMSC-064, 88 N.M. 516, 543 P.2d 484.\n\nEmployer common carrier.— An action under this section is limited to recovery only from the employer common carrier.In re Estate of Reilly, 1957-NMSC-095, 63 N.M. 352, 319 P.2d 1069.\n\nOwner driving truck as common carrier.— Where injury is caused by the owner operating truck as a common carrier rather than by an employee or agent of the common carrier this section has no application.White v. Montoya, 1942-NMSC-031, 46 N.M. 241, 126 P.2d 471.\n\nUnauthorized operator driving.— The owner of a truck operated as a common carrier for hire will be liable for wrongful act causing death, even though the truck was at the time being driven by an unauthorized person, while the regular operator slept.Cain v. Bowlby, 114 F.2d 519 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 311 U.S. 710, 61 S. Ct. 319, 85 L. Ed. 462 (1940).\n\nEmployee-driver.— Recovery may not be had under this section against the \"employee-driver\" of a \"public conveyance.\"Langham v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 1975-NMSC-064, 88 N.M. 516, 543 P.2d 484.\n\nStatute excludes any liability of negligent employee for wrongful death.Campbell v. Matteucci, 261 F.2d 225 (10th Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 966, 79 S. Ct. 877, 3 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1959);Schloss v. Matteucci, 260 F.2d 16 (10th Cir. 1958).\n\nEffect of ejusdem generis.— This section controls actions for wrongful death caused by negligence of a truck while engaged as a common carrier, and the doctrine of ejusdem generis does not restrict its applicability to passenger carrying conveyances, for it is not confined to means of transportation which were known at time of its original enactment in 1882.Sanchez v. Contract Trucking Co., 1941-NMSC-049, 45 N.M. 506, 117 P.2d 815.\n\nSection applies to truck common carrier for hire.— In respect to the recovery of damages for wrongful death which by terms of the statute applies to death resulting from operation of a locomotive, car, stage coach or other public conveyance, considering the statute as being prospective in operation, it applies to death occasioned by the wrongful act of the operator of a truck engaged as a common carrier for hire.Cain v. Bowlby, 114 F.2d 519 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 311 U.S. 710, 61 S. Ct. 319, 85 L. Ed. 462 (1940).\n\nCommon carriers by air are includedalong with other common carriers within the term \"other public conveyance\" contained in this section.In re Estate of Reilly, 1957-NMSC-095, 63 N.M. 352, 319 P.2d 1069.\n\nAn airline company engaged regularly in the transportation of persons and property for hire between points within the state and from a point within this state and return thereto is a common carrier.In re Estate of Reilly, 1957-NMSC-095, 63 N.M. 352, 319 P.2d 1069.\n\nLiability of pilot barred.— Since an action is limited to recovery only from the employer common carrier, no recovery under this section may be had against the pilot.In re Estate of Reilly, 1957-NMSC-095, 63 N.M. 352, 319 P.2d 1069.\n\nIn an action arising out of the crash of a common carrier airplane against the estate of the pilot to recover damages for wrongful deaths, the court dismissed the action.Campbell v. Matteucci, 261 F.2d 225 (10th Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 966, 79 S. Ct. 877, 3 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1959).\n\nContract and common carriers contrasted.— One who gathers garbage for disposal is a contract carrier and not a common carrier since the latter transports goods or property consigned for delivery.Fairchild v. United Serv. Corp., 1948-NMSC-048, 52 N.M. 289, 197 P.2d 875.\n\nContributory negligence may be urged as a defenseunder the wrongful death statute as may any common-law defenses where the lawmakers omit any reference as to defenses which might be interposed.Le Doux v. Martinez, 1953-NMSC-016, 57 N.M. 86, 254 P.2d 685.\n\nEffect of pleadings on jury instructions.— Where the pleadings as framed limited the issue of contributory negligence to the parents and the child, an instruction that negligent acts of an uncle with whom the two year old child was crossing the street were imputable to child's parents, had no basis and was erroneous.Le Doux v. Martinez, 1953-NMSC-016, 57 N.M. 86, 254 P.2d 685.\n\nJury instruction erroneously refused.— In action for wrongful death of child of two years and eight months, an instruction that \"children of tender years are entitled to care proportionate to their inability to foresee and avoid perils which they may encounter\" and that \"the duty and standard of care required to avoid doing them injury increases with their inability to protect themselves\" was erroneously refused.Le Doux v. Martinez, 1953-NMSC-016, 57 N.M. 86, 254 P.2d 685.\n\nLimitation on who may be sued.— Where a statute gives the cause of action and designates the persons who may be sued, they alone are authorized to be sued.Langham v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 1975-NMSC-064, 88 N.M. 516, 543 P.2d 484.\n\nSuit in name of administrator prohibited.— A right of action for damages under this section does not exist in the name of the administrator of the estate of the deceased.Romero v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry., 1903-NMSC-008, 11 N.M. 679, 72 P. 37.\n\nEffect on children of suit by widow.— This section does not confer a collective right of action in favor of the widow and minor children of deceased, and where the widow sues within six months, the minor children have no right of action.Frampton v. Santa Fe Nw. Ry., 1930-NMSC-036, 34 N.M. 660, 287 P. 694.\n\nEffect of provisions authorizing suit by certain kinfolks.— Fact that wrongful death caused by common carrier was not, for want of proper kinship, maintainable under statute authorizing suit by certain kinfolks, did not make it maintainable under statute authorizing suit by same kinsmen for wrongful death caused by persons or corporations other than common carriers.Mallory v. Pioneer S.W. Stages, Inc., 54 F.2d 559 (10th Cir. 1931).\n\nRecovery where no dependents.— Where decedent suffered wrongful death, was over 21 years of age, unmarried and left no dependent wife, children, parents or other dependent person, personal representative could recover statutory amount due to negligence of common carrier.Tauch v. Ferguson-Steere Motor Co., 1957-NMSC-039, 62 N.M. 429, 312 P.2d 83.\n\nEffect of double dependency on right to recover.— Although the husband of the sister of the deceased was legally obligated to support her, and she was dependent upon him for support, that does not defeat her right to recover in wrongful death of brother if she was also dependent on him, and the question of dependency was for the jury.Myers v. Pac. Greyhound Lines, 134 F.2d 457 (10th Cir. 1943).\n\nSince this section fails to define dependence, it would appear that substantial dependence of a sibling and substantial contributions to support are enough to entitle the sibling to obtain a recovery.Myers v. Pac. Greyhound Lines, 134 F.2d 457 (10th Cir. 1943).\n\nSurvival of action.— Cause of action, for death, asserted against a defendant as personal representative of alleged wrongdoer, a common carrier, did not survive the latter's death irrespective of the statute creating a right of action against the carrier, by reason of the survival statute, 37-2-1 NMSA 1978.Ickes v. Brimhall, 1938-NMSC-036, 42 N.M. 412, 79 P.2d 942.\n\nEffect of death on appeal.— Death of widow, pending appeal from adverse judgment, does not abate her suit to recover against common carrier for the death of her husband, but such cause may be revived in the name of her personal representative.Frampton v. Santa Fe Nw. Ry., 1930-NMSC-036, 34 N.M. 660, 287 P. 694.\n\nPresumption of care.— There is a presumption, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that a person killed in crossing a railroad track, stopped, looked and listened.De Padilla v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry., 1911-NMSC-060, 16 N.M. 576, 120 P. 724.\n\nEstoppel.— Upon the expiration of the three-year limitation period provided in 41-2-2 NMSA 1978, the right to maintain suit for the alleged wrongful death of decedent terminated, or was thereafter barred. Estoppel cannot be successfully asserted to lengthen the existence of such a statutorily created right of recovery.Perry v. Staver, 1970-NMCA-096, 81 N.M. 766, 473 P.2d 380.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"The Economic Side of Wrongful Death Actions in New Mexico,\" see 2 N.M.L. Rev. 127 (1972).\n\nAm.
