      "text": "A. Whenever a majority of the resident freeholders owning more than one-half of the lands, or the evidence of title to the lands, in any district in the state desire to provide for the irrigation of the lands, they may propose the organization of an irrigation district under the provisions of Chapter 73, Article 9 NMSA 1978. When so organized, each district shall have the powers conferred by law upon irrigation districts. Provided that where ditches, canals or reservoirs were constructed before March 18, 1909, those ditches, canals, reservoirs and franchises and the lands irrigated from them shall be exempt from the operation of Chapter 73, Article 9 NMSA 1978, unless the district is formed to purchase, acquire or lease the ditches, canals, reservoirs and their franchises; or unless a statement, signed by at least four-fifths of the owners of any such ditch, canal or reservoir and of the franchises and water rights of them and of the lands irrigated from them, is filed with the board of county commissioners of each county in which the ditch, canal, reservoir and lands are situate, giving their consent that the ditch, canal, reservoir, franchises, water rights and lands may be included in one or more irrigation districts organized under the provisions of Chapter 73, Article 9 NMSA 1978, which statement shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk of the county.\n\nB. Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the status of an acequia or community ditch association as a political subdivision of the state if the acequia or community ditch association was established prior to the formation of the irrigation district and has been governed by officers elected pursuant to Chapter 73, Article 2 or 3 NMSA 1978 continuously since the formation of the irrigation district.\n\nHistory:Laws 1919, ch. 41, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 73-201; 1941 Comp., § 77-2101; 1953 Comp., § 75-22-1; 2001, ch. 221, § 3.\n\nCross references.— For the definition of \"resident freeholder,\"see73-9-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the purchase of tax certificates by irrigation districts,see73-13-19 to 73-13-23 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the definition of \"irrigation law,\"see73-13-43 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor Uniform Unclaimed Property Act,seeChapter 7, Article 8A NMSA 1978.\n\nFor impounding animals in irrigation districts,see77-14-8 to 77-14-12 and 77-14-24 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, added the section heading, added Subsection B, and made stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nNot invalid as special legislation.— This section does not violate the sections of the New Mexico Constitution prohibiting class legislation, or special laws.Davy v.

McNeill, 1925-NMSC-040, 31 N.M. 7, 240 P. 482.\n\nMajority owning more than one-half land of district required.— Where it appears that the outer boundaries of a district include some 20,000 acres of land, of which 10,627 acres are irrigable, and petition is signed by owners of 7,600 acres of irrigable land within said outside boundaries, and, upon examination of the tabulated statement attached to the petition as to the ownership of lands, from which said irrigable lands are taken, it appears that more than 10,000 acres are owned by these particular landowners, and that this includes not only a majority of the land included within the outside boundaries, but also of irrigable land, the petition is a sufficient compliance with this section.Davy v. McNeill, 1925-NMSC-040, 31 N.M. 7, 240 P. 482.\n\nIrrigation projects cannot impair navigability.— Congressional acts providing for the reclamation of arid lands do not authorize appropriation of the waters of the source of navigable streams above the point of navigability, to such an extent as to destroy or seriously injure their navigability.

Said petition shall be signed by a majority of the resident freeholders within said proposed district, and who shall also be the owners in the aggregate of a majority of the whole number of acres of land within the said proposed district. The said petition shall also be accompanied by a good and sufficient bond, to be approved by said board of county commissioners in double the amount of the probable cost of organizing such district, conditioned for the payment of all costs incurred in said proceeding in case said organization shall not be effected, but in case such organization is so effected, then said expenses incurred by the board of county commissioners shall be paid back to said county by said district.

As soon as practicable after the board shall have organized it shall employ a competent hydraulic engineer to determine and report upon the water supply available for the district, which report shall be a full and complete record of all hydrographic data available and relating to the stream, streams or other sources of water supply from which water for the district is to be obtained; the report shall contain an estimate of the average amount of water available for each acre of land per year and shall show approximately the probable amounts available for irrigation or storage during each week of the year. The report accompanied by an examination fee of $25.00, shall be submitted to the state engineer for his examination and if he shall find such report to be a full and complete record of the available hydrographic data, that the calculations are correct and that there will be water in the source or sources of supply sufficient to properly irrigate the lands included within such district, he shall so certify under his hand and official seal. If the report submitted is found to be insufficient, or incorrect, the state engineer shall return the same for correction to the directors of the district with a statement of his objections.

In case of the purchase of any property by said district the bonds of the district hereinafter provided for may be used at their par value in payment without previous offer of such bonds for sale.

Att'y Gen. No. 64-01.\n\nTo prevent forfeiture.— This section provides that a water right acquired by an irrigation district will not be lost by forfeiture if the water to which the district is entitled by virtue of such right is leased or rented and therefore used upon land other than the land to which the right may have been appurtenant. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-01.\n\nLeasing and using of water deemed beneficial use.— The leasing or renting of water by an irrigation district together with the use thereof by the lessee is a beneficial use within the constitutional requirement of N.M. Const., art. XVI, § 3. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-01.\n\nAbatement of public nuisance maintained by irrigation district allowed.— A court could certainly hold that the Elephant Butte irrigation district is maintaining a public nuisance in that its ditches and canals are breeding mosquitoes that have resulted in the presence of encephalitis. Although New Mexico has no specific provision requiring the abatement of this particular type of nuisance, the conditions now existing constitute a nuisance at common law and hence should be abated in the interest of the public health and safety in the opinion of this office. 1958 Op.
