      "text": "The purpose of this act [73-1-1 to 73-1-13 and 73-1-16 to 73-1-23 NMSA 1978] is to provide for the organization of artesian conservancy districts to conserve, where necessary, the waters in any artesian basin or basins within the state, the boundaries of which have been scientifically determined by investigations, and where such waters have been beneficially appropriated for private, public, domestic, commercial or irrigation purposes, or otherwise.\n\nHistory:Laws 1931, ch. 97, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 77-1301; 1953 Comp., § 75-13-1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The term \"this act\" means Laws 1931, Ch. 93, §§ 1 to 23, compiled as 73-1-1 to 73-1-13, 73-1-16 to 73-1-23 NMSA 1978.\n\nCross references.— For supervision of artesian waters generally,see72-13-2 NMSA 1978.\n\n\"Conserve\" connotesa saving or preserving from loss.Pecos Valley Artesian Conservancy Dist. v. Peters, 1945-NMSC-029, 50 N.M. 165, 173 P.2d 490.\n\nDistrict has standing and duty to sue.— When a vested water right of the owners of the district is in question, the district has not only standing but a duty to participate in litigation affecting those rights. As conservancy district is the owner of water rights, it is incumbent upon it to assert any position it feels affects those rights, and it may sue and defend for its water users in a representative capacity where such water users have a common or general interest in the subject matter of the suit.State ex rel. Reynolds v. Lewis, 1973-NMSC-035, 84 N.M. 768, 508 P.2d 577.\n\nEnjoining unauthorized water use.— Though an artesian conservancy district owned no land serviced by waters of an artesian basin and no water rights, it constituted a proper party plaintiff for maintaining a suit to enjoin the use of water from an unauthorized well.Pecos Valley Artesian Conservancy Dist. v. Peters, 1945-NMSC-029, 50 N.M. 165, 173 P.2d 490).\n\nDecree binding on district users.— Action to enjoin use of water from an unauthorized well is of the nature of suit to quiet title, and the decree is binding on all water users within the conservancy district, notwithstanding none as individuals were parties to suit; district is authorized agent of all its water users.Pecos Valley Artesian Conservancy Dist. v. Peters, 1948-NMSC-022, 52 N.M. 148, 193 P.2d 418.\n\nExcessive water use by individual landowner would constitute wasteful practicein derogation of the best interests of the entire conservancy district, presenting a proper subject for action by the board of directors of the district. 1952 Op.

It shall not be necessary for the clerk to name the parties interested, nor to describe the separate lots, tracts or parcels of land affected in giving such notice, but it shall be sufficient to give such descriptions of the boundaries of the underground waters proposed to be included as will enable the owner to determine whether or not his rights will be affected. The notice shall state that any person affected by the proposed inclusion of such waters shall have the right to file objections thereto, on or before the date set for hearing. If, after hearing such objections, if any, and considering any evidence introduced in support thereof, the court finds that it is reasonably certain that a substantial portion of said waters are derived from the artesian basin, or basins, included in such district, and that the same are so closely related to such artesian waters that they can be effectively conserved by said district, the court shall enter an order amending said decree, as prayed for in said petition, and thereupon said waters shall be subject to the same rights, powers and authority as given by law to such conservancy district over artesian waters.\n\nHistory:Laws 1941, ch. 98, § 2; 1941 Comp., § 77-1323; 1953 Comp., § 75-13-23.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For authority of state engineer to measure waters of state,see72-2-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor law relating to underground waters,seeChapter 72, Article 12 NMSA 1978.",
