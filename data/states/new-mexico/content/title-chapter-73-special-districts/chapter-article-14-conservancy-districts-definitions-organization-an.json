Laws 1990, ch. 48, § 1 added 73-14-20.1 NMSA 1978 to the Conservancy Act. Laws 1939, ch. 148, defined the \"Conservancy Act of New Mexico\" as the Conservancy Act and defined other terms used in the Conservancy District-Reclamation Control Act, 73-18-24 NMSA 1978. Laws 1939, ch. 148, § 1 is compiled as 73-18-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nAlthough the official short title of the Laws of 1927, ch. 45 is the \"Conservancy Act of New Mexico\", there are numerous references in Articles 14 through 18 of Chapter 73, NMSA 1978 to the \"Conservancy Act\".

      "text": "A. The conservancy court is hereby vested with jurisdiction, power and authority, when the conditions stated in Section 202 [73-14-5 NMSA 1978] are found to exist, to establish conservancy districts for all or any of the following purposes:\n\n(1) preventing floods;\n\n(2) regulating stream channels by changing, widening or deepening the same;\n\n(3) regulating the flow of streams;\n\n(4) diverting, controlling or in whole or in part eliminating watercourses;\n\n(5) reclaiming, draining or filling wet and overflowed lands;\n\n(6) of providing for irrigation where it may be needed and otherwise benefiting and developing agricultural lands or lands susceptible of irrigation or agricultural development;\n\n(7) protecting public and private property from inundation.\n\nIncident to the foregoing purposes and to enable their accomplishment, any district so established shall have the power to straighten, widen, deepen, divert or change the course or terminus of any natural or artificial watercourse; drainage, irrigation or community ditches, or acequias; to build reservoirs, canals, drainage, irrigation or community ditches or acequias, levees, walls, embankments, bridges or dams; to drain, reclaim or fill low lands and lands subject to overflow; to make improvements, to remove and to regulate and prescribe the location of improvements upon land; to maintain, operate and repair any of the construction herein named; to sink wells, to purchase, develop and reclaim waters for the purpose of using, distributing, selling or leasing the same; to construct, operate, lease and control plants for the generation, distribution, sale, lease and use of electric energy; to construct, maintain and operate irrigation and drainage works or systems, necessary to maintain the irrigability of lands within the district, or to purchase, extend, improve, operate and maintain constructed works; to cooperate and contract with the federal or any state government or agent or department thereof; to promote the agricultural resources and marketing facilities of the district; to levy assessments, issue bonds and make appropriations of money, and to do all things necessary to effectuate and fulfill the purposes of this act; and such powers shall also be appraised as herein provided.\n\nB. The conservancy court shall thereafter, for all purposes of this act, except as heretofore or hereinafter otherwise provided, maintain and have original and exclusive jurisdiction coextensive with the boundaries of said district, and of lands and other property proposed to be included in said district or affected by said district, without regard to the usual limits of its jurisdiction.\n\nC. No judge of such court wherein such petition is filed or other judge exercising administrative or judicial functions under the provisions of this act shall be disqualified to perform any duty imposed by this act by reason of ownership of property within any district or proposed district, or by reason of ownership of any property that may be benefited, taxed or assessed therein.\n\nHistory:Laws 1927, ch. 45, § 201; C.S. 1929, § 30-201; 1941 Comp., § 77-2704; 1953 Comp., § 75-28-4.\n\nCompiler's notes.— For meaning of \"this act\",seecompiler's notes to 73-14-3 NMSA 1978..\n\nCross references.— For definition of conservancy court,see73-14-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor establishment of guaranty fund,see73-16-41 to 73-16-49 NMSA 1978.\n\nConstitutionality of powers and duties conferred.— Powers and duties conferred upon the district court by this act (Laws 1927, ch. 45) are essentially judicial and do not violate N.M. Const., art. III, § 1.Gutierrez v. Middle Rio Grande Conservancy Dist., 1929-NMSC-071, 34 N.M. 346, 282 P. 1, cert. denied, 280 U.S. 610, 50 S. Ct. 158, 74 L. Ed. 653 (1930).\n\nThe Conservancy Act (Laws 1927, ch. 45) is not unconstitutional under contention that under it the individual petitioners, by fixing the boundaries of the district are empowered to determine whether or not the property included will be benefited, thereby causing an unlawful delegation to them of the legislative power, as the petitioners must allege and the conservancy court must find that the property described in the petition will be benefited, not merely some of the property described.In re Arch Hurley Conservancy Dist., 1948-NMSC-001, 52 N.M. 34, 191 P.2d 338.\n\nThis act (Laws 1927, ch. 45) does not create a new courtin violation of N.M. Const., art. VI, § 1.Gutierrez v. Middle Rio Grande Conservancy Dist., 1929-NMSC-071, 34 N.M. 346, 282 P. 1, cert. denied, 280 U.S. 610, 50 S. Ct. 158, 74 L. Ed. 653 (1930).\n\nOther provisions not made unconstitutional.— This section does not of itself make the Conservancy Act (Laws 1927, ch. 45) unconstitutional under N.M. Const., art. VI, § 18.Gutierrez v. Middle Rio Grande Conservancy Dist., 1929-NMSC-071, 34 N.M. 346, 282 P. 1, cert. denied, 280 U.S. 610, 50 S. Ct. 158, 74 L. Ed. 653 (1930).\n\nScope of discretion to form districts.— A water conservancy district is a quasi-municipal corporation, the formation of which is a legislative function, and for which the Conservancy Act (Laws 1927, ch. 45) has set up certain standards and requirements and has delegated to the district court the ministerial and judicial task of determining whether these standards have been met in a given case; but the court does not have and could not constitutionally have been invested with a general discretion for the formation of whatever districts the court deemed to be in the public interest.Rancho Del Rio Grande Conservancy Dist. v. Tres Rios Ass'n, 1975-NMSC-024, 87 N.M. 482, 535 P.2d 1333.\n\nPowers not to be expanded beyond language.— Formation of a water conservancy district is a statutory proceeding and the powers conferred may not be expanded by inference or construction beyond the language of the statute.Rancho Del Rio Grande Conservancy Dist. v. Tres Rios Ass'n, 1975-NMSC-024, 87 N.M. 482, 535 P.2d 1333.\n\nJurisdiction not exclusive to determine collectibility of assessments.— There is a supportable inference in the Conservancy Act (Laws 1927, ch. 45) itself that the conservancy court does not have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the collectibility of assessments in the provision that the county treasurer is relieved of his statutory duty to collect them if their collection has been enjoined by order of court of competent jurisdiction.Tondre v. Garcia, 1941-NMSC-042, 45 N.M. 433, 116 P.2d 584.\n\nJurisdiction to issue injunction.— Injunction to restrain county treasurer from refusing to accept payment of county and state taxes unless taxpayers paid all conservancy district assessments against the lands need not be brought in conservancy court.Tondre v. Garcia, 1941-NMSC-042, 45 N.M. 433, 116 P.2d 584.\n\nJurisdiction to prevent wrongs.— Jurisdiction of a district court other than the conservancy court to prevent wrongs may not be successfully challenged merely because such district may be incidentally interested in the outcome of the litigation. This is not the kind of a case that is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the conservancy court.Tondre v. Garcia, 1941-NMSC-042, 45 N.M. 433, 116 P.2d 584.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"County Regulation of Land Use and Development,\"see9 Nat.

      "text": "A. Before any district shall be established under this act, a petition shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the court vested with jurisdiction, in a county in which all or a part of the lands embraced in said proposed district are situated, signed by the owners of more than one-third of the real property in such proposed district, in either acreage or value, as shown by the last preceding assessment roll of the county or counties wherein such district is proposed to be created.\n\nB. Whenever a proposed district shall include territory extending into more than one judicial district, the petition for the organization of said district shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the court in and for that county which has the greatest valuation of real property within the proposed district, as shown by the tax rolls of the respective counties.\n\nC. Such a petition may also be signed by any private corporations owning lands within the proposed district, or by the governing body of any public corporation lying wholly or partly within the proposed district, in such manner as it may prescribe, and when so signed, such petition shall fill all the requirements of representation upon such petition of the owners of land of such public corporation, as they appear upon the tax rolls; and thereafter it shall not be necessary for individuals within said public corporation to sign such a petition.\n\nD. Any city interested in some degree in the improvement, upon proper action by its governing body, may alone file the petition required by this section.\n\nE. The petition shall set forth:\n\n(1) the proposed name of said district;\n\n(2) that property within the proposed district will be benefited by the accomplishment of one or more of the purposes enumerated in Section 73-14-4 NMSA 1978;\n\n(3) a general description of the purpose of the contemplated improvement, and of the territory to be included in the proposed district; such description need not be given by metes and bounds or by legal subdivisions, but it shall be sufficient to enable a property owner to ascertain whether his property is within the territory proposed to be organized as a district; said territory need not be contiguous, provided it be so situated that the organization as a single district of the territory described is calculated to promote one or more of the purposes enumerated in Section 73-14-4 NMSA 1978;\n\n(4) said petition shall pray for the organization of the district by the name proposed.\n\nF. No petition with the requisite signatures shall be declared null and void on account of alleged defects, but the court may at any time permit the petition to be amended to conform to the facts, by correcting any errors in the description of the territory or in any other particular.\n\nG. Several similar petitions or duplicate copies of the same petition for the organization of the same district may be filed and shall together be regarded as one petition. All such petitions filed, prior to the hearing on the first petition filed, shall be considered by the court the same as though filed with the first petition.\n\nH. A guardian, conservator or personal representative of an estate who is appointed as such under the laws of this state, and who as such guardian, conservator or personal representative is entitled to the possession of the lands belonging to the estate which he represents, may, on behalf of his ward or the estate which he represents, upon being thereunto authorized by the proper court, sign and acknowledge the petition in this act mentioned and may act in respect to the said lands to the same extent and in the same manner as a private owner might act.\n\nI. For the inclusion in any existing district of territory beyond its boundaries, the same procedure as specified for the organization of a district may be followed by the landowners of the said territory; provided, however, approval and consent thereto by the court shall first have been obtained. Such territory may also be included by the appraisers of such existing district as hereinafter provided. In the event that all of the landowners of such territory desire to have the same included in such district, a petition signed by each of them shall be filed in the court which has jurisdiction over such district, and upon approval and consent thereto by the court, no further proceedings except the order of the court including such territory in such district shall be necessary. Provided, however, the directors of the district may be heard before the court on any objections the district may have to the inclusion of such territory therein because of the change in official plan and the appraisal of the benefits and damages.\n\nJ. In determining whether a requisite number of landowners have signed the petition, the court shall be governed by the names as they appear upon the tax roll, which shall be prima facie evidence of such ownership.\n\nK. No land shall be included or proposed to be included in any such district which is so situated that it cannot reasonably be drained, flooded or irrigated as an integral part thereof by or from any stream or waters to be controlled thereby, and is more than two miles distant from any lands above described.\n\nL. No district formed under the provisions of Chapter 140, Laws of New Mexico, 1923, or formed under the provisions of this act, for the protection and conservation of property in the Rio Grande valley, shall include any lands south of the Elephant Butte dam; provided that any district formed under said Chapter 140, Laws of New Mexico, 1923, shall retain all rights to impound and control the water of the Rio Grande or other streams or waters, or to acquire rights and property incident thereto that it now possesses, whether within or without the district as hereby limited and defined. Except as otherwise provided herein, the boundaries of any such district heretofore created shall be limited and confined to the territory as herein defined.\n\nHistory:Laws 1927, ch. 45, § 202; C.S. 1929, § 30-202; 1941 Comp., § 77-2705; 1953 Comp., § 75-28-5; Laws 1971, ch. 51, § 1; 1975, ch. 257, § 8-132.\n\nCompiler's notes.— For meaning of \"this act\",seecompiler's notes to 73-14-1 NMSA 1978 and 73-14-3 NMSA 1978..\n\nLaws 1927, ch. 45, § 910, compiled as 73-17-23 NMSA 1978, repealed Laws 1923, ch. 140, relating to establishing conservancy districts to cooperate with the federal government under federal reclamation law.\n\nCross references.— For the Probate Code,see45-1-101 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1975 amendment, effective July 1, 1976, substituted \"conservator or personal representative\" for \"executor or administrator\" in two places near the beginning of Subsection H.\n\nNo unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.— The Conservancy Act (Laws 1927, § 45) is not unconstitutional under contention that under it the individual petitioners, by fixing the boundaries of the district are empowered to determine whether or not the property included will be benefited, thereby causing an unlawful delegation to them of the legislative power, as the petitioners must allege and the conservancy court must find that the property described in the petition will be benefited, not merely some of the property described.In re Arch Hurley Conservancy Dist., 1948-NMSC-001, 52 N.M. 34, 191 P.2d 338.\n\nConstitutionality of former law.— Laws 1923, ch. 140, §§ 202, 205 (repealed), regarding petitions for the establishment of conservancy districts and hearings on said petitions, did not violate U.S. Const., amend. XIV, to N.M. Const., art. II, § 2 or art. XI, § 8 (art. XI, § 8 now repealed).In re Proposed Middle Rio Grande Conservancy Dist., 1925-NMSC-058, 31 N.M. 188, 242 P. 683.\n\nLegislative purpose not abused.— The true legislative purpose of the Conservancy Act (Laws 1927, ch. 45) was not abused by applying it to a strip of railroad right of way on account of incidental benefits that will be derived.In re Arch Hurley Conservancy Dist., 1948-NMSC-001, 52 N.M. 34, 191 P.2d 338.\n\nInclusion of certain Rio Grande valley lands not prohibited.— This section does not prohibit inclusion of lands in the Rio Grande valley in the north of Santa Fe county in conservancy districts organized for irrigation only.Cater v. Sunshine Valley Conservancy Dist., 1928-NMSC-061, 33 N.M. 583, 274 P. 52.\n\nEffect of repeal of prior law on refiled petition.— Where petition was filed for the organization of a district under the 1923 Conservancy Act before its repeal by Laws 1927, ch. 45, but before action, and by order of the court, the petition was withdrawn after the repeal and refiled as an original petition, proceeding was under Laws 1927, ch. 45, even though the prayer was inapt.Cater v. Sunshine Valley Conservancy Dist., 1928-NMSC-061, 33 N.M. 583, 274 P. 52.\n\nEffect of substantial change in property to be included.— In the formation of water conservancy districts which will result in the imposition of taxes or other assessments upon the property included therein, a substantial change in the property to be included from that described in the petition or petitions for the creation of such districts vitiates the petition or petitions and requires their dismissal.Rancho Del Rio Grande Conservancy Dist. v. Tres Rios Ass'n, 1975-NMSC-024, 87 N.M. 482, 535 P.2d 1333.\n\nOnce the people have weighed the merits of the proposal to establish a water conservancy district as embodied in the petition and each has estimated the burden and benefit for himself, it would be grossly unfair to permit changes to be made by eliminating property belonging to numerous individuals and municipalities, thus multiplying the cost per acre foot of water to the user; this would materially and substantially amend the signer's original petition without his authority, subjecting him to additional burdens, and cannot be approved.Rancho Del Rio Grande Conservancy Dist. v. Tres Rios Ass'n, 1975-NMSC-024, 87 N.M. 482, 535 P.2d 1333.\n\nResult of excluding certain lands from petitionfor creation of a water conservancy district is that the signatures of all persons on originating petitions become a nullity, since after the exclusions the petitions no longer describe the territory to be included in the proposed district. It cannot be assumed that any one of the petitioners would have affixed his signature to the originating petitions had he known that the district to be created would be substantially different from that made known to him by the instrument which he signed as an originating petitioner.Rancho Del Rio Grande Conservancy Dist. v. Tres Rios Ass'n, 1975-NMSC-024, 87 N.M. 482, 535 P.2d 1333.\n\nAll property in petition must be benefited.— The petitioners must allege and the conservancy court must find that the property described in the petition will be benefited by the organization of the conservancy district - not some of the property described in the petition, but all of it, and upon finding some of the lands would not be benefited, the conservancy court should have dismissed the petition; when it permitted the amendment of the petition and the creation of a new and different district, it exceeded its authority.Rancho Del Rio Grande Conservancy Dist. v. Tres Rios Ass'n, 1975-NMSC-024, 87 N.M. 482, 535 P.2d 1333.\n\nPetition proposal must be specific.— To make the support evidenced by the filing of a petition for the creation of a water conservancy district meaningful, and to comply with the notice requirements of due process, the proposal in the petition must be specific; otherwise, a citizen cannot form an intelligent opinion as to whether to sign and has no way of knowing what he is petitioning for or what he is agreeing to pay and the effect of his signing upon others who also will be taxed.Rancho Del Rio Grande Conservancy Dist. v. Tres Rios Ass'n, 1975-NMSC-024, 87 N.M. 482, 535 P.2d 1333.\n\nSignatures by private and public corporations.— Petition to establish and organize a conservancy district must be signed by owners of more than one-third of the real property in the proposed district, in either acreage or value, as shown by the last preceding tax roll of the county wherein the district is to be created, but Subsection C of said section plainly authorizes private corporations and governing bodies of public corporations, lying wholly or partly within the proposed district and owning lands therein, to sign such petition in a representative capacity, thereby dispensing with the requirement that the petition be signed by landowners individually.In re Sandia Conservancy Dist., 1953-NMSC-056, 57 N.M. 413, 259 P.2d 577.\n\nIncidental benefits to lands included in district.— The Conservancy Act specifically provides for the inclusion of lands that will not be directly benefited by the establishment or enlargement of a district. A district may be established or enlarged if some of the lands to be included will receive only incidental benefits. The lands to be incidentally benefited, however, must not lie more than two miles from the lands to be irrigated, drained, or protected from flooding as an integral part of the district. 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-13.\n\nExtension of La Plata conservancy district to include Farmington and Aztec precluded.— Subsection K of this section would preclude the extension of the boundaries of the La Plata conservancy district to include Farmington and Aztec since nearly all of the land within the limits of Farmington, Aztec, and the surrounding area proposed to be included within the boundaries of the La Plata conservancy district is located more than two miles from district land that would be drained, irrigated, or protected from flooding by the district or Animas-La Plata project facilities. 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-13.\n\nAm.

In order to protect life and property within the district, and to protect or relieve land subject to overflow or washing, or which is menaced or threatened by the normal flow of flood or surplus or overflow waters of any natural watercourse, stream, canyon, arroyo or wash, whether perennial, intermittent or flood, and in order to effect the protection of life, land and other property in the district and to accomplish all other purposes of the district, the board is authorized and empowered to clean out, strighten [straighten], widen, alter, deepen or change the course or terminus of any ditch, community ditch or acequia, drain, sewer, flume, river, watercourse, pond, lake, creek, arroyo or natural or artificial stream in or out of said district; to fill up any abandoned or altered ditch, community ditch or acequia, drain, sewer, river, flume, watercourse, pond, lake, creek, arroyo or natural or artificial stream, and to concentrate, divert or divide the flow of water in or out of said district; to construct and maintain main and lateral ditches, community ditches or acequias, sewers, canals, flumes, levees, dikes, dams, sluices, revetments, reservoirs, or retarding basins, floodways, wells, pumping stations and syphons and any other works and improvements deemed necessary to construct, preserve, operate or maintain the works in or out of said district; to construct, reconstruct or enlarge or cause to be constructed, reconstructed or enlarged, any and all bridges that may be needed in or out of said district; to construct, reconstruct or elevate highways and streets; to construct or reconstruct any and all of said works and improvements along, across, through or over any public highway, canal, railroad right-of-way, track, grade, fill or cut, in or out of said district; to remove or change the location of any fence, building, railroad, canal or other improvements in or out of said district; and shall have the right to acquire by donation, purchase or condemnation, to construct, own, lease, use and sell, to hold, encumber, control and maintain any easement, water right, acequias, well, railroad right-of-way, canal, sluice, flume, reservoir site, reservoir or retarding basin, mill dam, water power, franchise, park, cemetery or any other public way or place, or any real or personal property, public or private, in or out of said district, for rights-of-way and such other things, or for materials of construction or for any other use not inconsistent with the purposes of this act; and to replot or subdivide land, open new roads, highways, parks, streets and alleys, or change the location of existing ones; and provided, further, that in case the construction provided by the official plan interferes with an irrigation ditch, community ditch or acequia or other works used for applying water to beneficial use the district shall make equivalent provision by means of ditches or works constructed by the district at its expense for supplying such water to such water users to the extent that the same was being lawfully obtained and used through such ditches or works. The district shall have the right to increase at its expense the storage capacity of any reservoirs and to store therein or release therefrom water in excess of the capacity of such reservoirs as developed by any person; but such additional storage so created by the district shall not interfere with the storage and regulation of flow of water as developed by such person prior to such increased storage capacity being added by the district; and, that in case the district shall increase the storage capacity of any such reservoir, either by adding to the dam, dams or other structures built, or by removing such dam, dams or other structures and rebuilding same, the damages, if any, to such person for the property so utilized or removed shall be ascertained and paid as provided in the case of property taken by the district by right of eminent domain.\n\nHistory:Laws 1927, ch. 45, § 308; C.S. 1929, § 30-308; 1941 Comp., § 77-2718; 1953 Comp., § 75-28-18.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCompiler's notes.— For the meaning of \"this act\",seecompiler's notes to 73-14-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nAs enacted, this section contained no Subsection B.\n\nCross references.— For eminent domain by conservancy district,see73-14-41, 73-14-42 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor elections for directors in districts of 100,000 acres or less,see73-14-62 to 73-14-66 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor audit of records in districts of 100,000 acres or less,see73-14-68 NMSA 1978.\n\nRight to enforce water control through injunction.— On acquiring community ditch, conservancy district was \"proper party\" to enforce by injunction its right to control flow of water in the ditch and the delivery of same to those entitled to it.Middle Rio Grande Conservancy Dist. v. Chavez, 1940-NMSC-016, 44 N.M. 240, 101 P.2d 190.\n\nRight to supply water where only district assessments paid.— Where conservancy district acquired a community ditch after due appraisal and compensation, it could supply water to users who had paid all assessments due the district regardless of payment of assessments levied by community ditch commissioners and mayordomo.Middle Rio Grande Conservancy Dist. v. Chavez, 1940-NMSC-016, 44 N.M. 240, 101 P.2d 190.\n\nConflict of interest.— Because no statute defines the duties of a member of a board of directors of a conservancy district when a conflict of interest arises, the common law prevails. At common law, a member of a governing board is disqualified from voting on a matter in which he has a direct personal, financial interest, and a court will invalidate any board action in violation of this rule. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-18.\n\nIndemnity agreements in conservancy district licensee agreements.— Conservancy districts generally have broad authority to construct and maintain main, lateral, and community ditches and the authority to complete works and improvements to accomplish all other purposes of the district; conservancy districts also have the corresponding authority to negotiate and enter into contracts to fulfill their purpose, except as otherwise limited by law, and therefore, where the middle Rio Grande conservancy district (district) entered into an agreement with a licensee to install and maintain a gate on district roads, a provision of which requires the licensee to indemnify the district against any claims arising out of the installation, operation, and existence of the gate, the indemnity provision in the district's license agreement is enforceable to the extent that the provision would indemnify the district against the licensee's negligent maintenance, repair, condition or use of the gate. The indemnity provision's enforceability, however, is limited to the extent that it indemnifies the district against the negligent act or omissions of the licensee and not against claims arising out of the district's own negligence, because indemnity clauses that indemnify indemnitees for their own negligence are void and unenforceable as against the public policy of the state.Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District Gate Licensee Liability(2/3/20), Att'y Gen.

All the rights and property of the district in the waters and watercourses thereof, and in their use, shall be exercised in such a manner as to promote the welfare of the district and of all the inhabitants thereof; to promote the safest, most economical and most reasonable use of such waters; to protect the water rights of the lands and landowners of the district; to encourage and promote agriculture and industry and to pay the cost of constructing, maintaining and operating the improvements.\n\nC. The rights of persons or public corporations and of other users of water, to the waters in and of the district for irrigation, water supply, industrial purposes, water power or for any other purposes, shall extend only to such rights as were owned by them or their predecessors prior to their inclusion in the district; and to such use as could be made of such waters if the improvements of the districts had not been made.\n\nD. At the time of the general appraisal of benefits and damages of the district, or at any subsequent time, the board may cause a determination to be made of the conditions and extent of the water rights, and water supply and of the watercourses within the district as they were before the improvements of the district were made, or as they existed at any subsequent time, and they may make a determination of all rights, property, easements or other interests in the waters, or the watercourses, such determination being based upon records of greatest and least flow, upon the evidence of use, or evidence of legal rights, and upon any other evidence and records which may be available.\n\nE. Upon the completion of such determination, the board shall make its report thereon to the court. Thereupon a hearing shall be had, notice shall be given of the pendency of said report and of the hearing, which notice and hearing shall conform as nearly as possible to the notice and hearing on appraisals of benefits and of land to be taken; and the right of appeal shall exist. Such final determination shall be the basis of any future use of the waters in the district; provided that in case any party shall thereafter establish in court any right or property in the waters in the district or the use thereof, which has not been adjudicated, the existence of such right, or the failure to adjudicate it, shall not affect the operation of this provision nor the findings of the court thereon in any other particular.\n\nF. Where the district acquires by purchase, condemnation or otherwise, water or water rights, or where it conserves, develops or reclaims water, it shall have the rights which go with the appropriation and beneficial use thereof; save and except such use for which benefits have been appraised and assessments levied by the district upon property for irrigation purposes; and the development, conservation or reclamation of water by the district is hereby declared to be an appropriation thereof by the district, and the disposition thereof under the terms of this act is hereby declared to be a beneficial use thereof by said district and by the lands included therein.\n\nG. The expression \"greater, better or more convenient use of the waters of the district, or benefit therefrom\" as hereafter used, refers to use or benefit which is made greater, better or more convenient by the organization, administration and works of the district, as compared with use or benefit which could be had under the conditions existing before the district was organized.\n\nH. The appraisals of benefits made by the appraisers may include benefits appraised for the greater, better or more convenient use of the waters of the district, or benefit therefrom; but if such benefits are not assessed, as in case of high lying lands for which water supply is at first uncertain, but afterwards is found to be available, the district may provide by contract or other agreement as hereafter provided, for such greater, better or more convenient use, and receive compensation therefor in accordance with the following provisions.\n\nI. Persons, public corporations or others desiring to secure such use of the waters or watercourses of the district, or of the district rights therein, may make application to the board for permission to lease, or purchase for such use. Such application shall state the purposes and character of such use, the period and degree of continuity of such use, the amount of water desired and the place of use. In case any party makes greater, better or more convenient use of the waters of the district without formal application, the fact of such use shall serve all purposes of an application, and the board may proceed to determine a reasonable rate of compensation the same as though formal application has been made. Where it is not possible or reasonable to grant all applications, preference shall be given to the greatest need and to the most reasonable use, as may be determined by the board, subject to the approval of the court. Preference shall be given, first, to domestic and municipal water supply, and no charge shall be made for the use of water taken by private persons for home and farmyard use, or for watering farm stock; second, to supplying water used in irrigation, processes of manufacture, for the production of steam, for refrigerating, cooling and condensing and for maintaining sanitary conditions of stream flow; third, for power development, recreation, fisheries and for other uses. All sales, leases, assignments or other acts of the board affecting the use, sale or lease of the waters of the district under this section, shall be subject to the approval of the court.\n\nJ. The board shall not permanently sell, lease, assign, permit or otherwise part with the control by the district of the use of the waters thereof; provided, however, that upon the recommendation of the chief engineer the board may contract to furnish a permanent water supply for lands susceptible of irrigation, at rates to be established as hereinafter provided. Rates for light, power or other services charged by vendees, assignees, lessees or licensees of such board shall be subject at all times to revision and control by state law. Assignments, leases, sales or permissions, except as to contracts hereinbefore authorized, may be made for periods of not greater than ten (10) years, except that with the approval of the court, such assignments, permissions, leases or sales, when necessary to justify investments for constructing and establishing, manufacturing power and industrial plants or works, may be made for longer terms, but not to exceed fifty years. At the termination of the period of such permission, assignments, leases or sales, they shall be renewable for a reasonable period not longer than is provided by this section, on the condition that a new determination be made of a reasonable charge therefor, as herein provided; unless there are other applications on file, the granting of which would result in filling a greater need or a more reasonable use. In case such applications are on file, they shall have preference.\n\nK. The board may make regulations for the determination and measurement of the greater, or better or more convenient use of, or benefit from the water supply of the district, for the purpose of determining rates of compensation, and for the purpose of securing to all parties interested the greatest and best use of the waters thereof. The board shall have power to determine the rates of compensation for such greater, better or more convenient use of, or benefit from the water supply of the district, which rates shall be reasonable, and may require bond to be given to secure the payment for such use.\n\nUpon the determination of any rate, or rates, the board shall make a report of its determination to the court. The court shall thereupon cause personal notice by summons to be given to the parties interested, stating that such a determination of rates has been made, that a hearing before the court will be had thereon on a certain day and that objection may be made at such time to such determination of rates. The hearing may be had before the court, and objection may be made, in the same manner as in case of the appraisal of benefits. Upon the final determination of the matter by the court, the determination of such rates of compensation shall be conclusive and binding for the period set forth in the order of the court; and in the event the said matter is before the court upon an agreement to lease, assign or sell, it shall be binding for the term and under the conditions specified in the lease or other agreement as approved by the court.\n\nL.
