The referendum held to approve or reject the resolution of the supervisors shall be conducted pursuant to the Local Election Act [Chapter 1, Article 22 NMSA 1978]. After the initial authorization is approved by referendum, the supervisors shall adopt a resolution in each following year authorizing the levy.\n\nB. A resolution authorized under Subsection A of this section shall not be effective, and neither a referendum nor a levy is authorized, unless the resolution is submitted to and approved in writing by the commission.\n\nC. In the event a resolution of the supervisors is adopted and approved in accordance with the provisions of Subsection A of this section, the supervisors of the district shall certify by the fifteenth of July of each year to the county assessor of each county in which there is situate land subject to the district assessment:\n\n(1) a copy of the resolution of the supervisors;\n\n(2) the results of any referendum held in the year the certification is made; and\n\n(3) a list of landowners of the district and a description of the land owned by each that is subject to assessment.\n\nD.

added present Subsection B and redesignated subsequent subsections accordingly; and in Subsection C, substituted \"approved in accordance with the provisions of Subsection A of this section\" for \"approved by the voters of the district at referendum\" and present Paragraph (2) for the former paragraph, which read \"the results of the referendum; and\".\n\nThe 1986 amendment,in Subsection A, substituted the language following \"not exceeding\" in the first sentence for \"one mill per dollar of total taxable valuation of real property, except that real property within incorporated cities and towns in the district may be excluded\" and inserted \"by July 15 of each year\" in the second sentence; in Subsection B, inserted \"by the fifteenth of July of each year\" in the introductory paragraph; in Subsections C, F, and G, substituted \"tax schedules\" for \"tax rolls\"; and, in Subsection F, substituted \"by July 15 of each year\" for \"prior to that year's county ad valorem assessment\".\n\nSale of personal property of district.— Unless the provisions of Section 13-6-2 NMSA 1978 are complied with, personal property of a soil conservation district (now soil and water conservation district) cannot be sold, regardless of how or from whom acquired, without first obtaining approval of the state board of finance. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-125.\n\nFuture levy.— Supervisors of district could adopt resolution calling for future assessment of a one mill tax to be levied in the event district was unable to repay money borrowed from interstate stream commission. 1972 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 72-54.\n\nTen-year limit applies to mill levies passed prior to the 2018 amendment.— Prior to the 2018 amendment to 73-20-46(A) NMSA 1978, this provision limited annual mill levies to one dollar per each thousand dollars of net taxable value for a period stated in the referendum of up to ten years, but in 2018, the New Mexico legislature amended this provision to increase the maximum annual amount of annual mill levies from one dollar to five dollars per each one thousand dollars of net taxable value and removed the language limiting mill levies to a stated period of up to ten years, and in 2019, clarified, by the enactment of 73-20-46.1 NMSA 1978, that a levy approved by the voters of a district and authorized by the commission pursuant to 73-20-46 NMSA 1978 prior to July 1, 2018 shall continue to be assessed pursuant to the laws in effect at the time the levy was initially approved. Hence, mill levies approved and existing prior to July 1, 2018 remain limited to a stated period of up to ten years.Recent Amendments to the Soil and Water Conservation District Act(12/4/20), Att'y Gen. Adv.

Hence, soil and water conservation districts holding a mill levy that existed prior to July 1, 2018 would retain that same mill levy if the district held a subsequent referendum and failed to approve a new mill levy or an increase in its old levy. Similarly, the successful passage of a new or increased mill levy would not affect the ten-year limit on an existing mill levy, and an increase in the amount of an older mill levy that existed prior to July 1, 2018 would remain subject to the ten-year limit after it was increased and could only be increased up to one dollar on each thousand dollars of net taxable value.Recent Amendments to the Soil and Water Conservation District Act(12/4/20), Att'y Gen.
