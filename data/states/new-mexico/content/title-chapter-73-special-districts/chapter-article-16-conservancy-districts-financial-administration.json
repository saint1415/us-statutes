The said assessment shall be levied by resolution of the board; shall be known as the preliminary fund assessment; and the amount of assessment shall be certified to the boards of county commissioners of the various counties in which the district, or any portion thereof, is located, and by them included in their next annual levy for state and county purposes. Said amount shall be collected for the use of such district in the same manner as are taxes for county purposes, and the revenue laws of the state for the levy and collection of taxes for county purposes, except as herein modified, shall be applicable for the levy and collection of the amount certified by the board of such district as aforesaid, including the enforcement of penalties and forfeiture for delinquent taxes. All collections made by the county treasurer pursuant to such levy shall be paid to the treasurer of the district on or before the tenth day of the next succeeding calendar month and a list of the payers, the amounts paid by each and the property covered thereby shall accompany such remittance.\n\nC. If such items of expense have already been paid in whole or in part from other sources, they may be repaid from the receipts of such levy, and such levy may be made although the work proposed may have been found impracticable or for other reasons is abandoned.\n\nD. In case the proceeds of such assessment, including those of any other assessment previously made for the preliminary fund, exceeds, [exceed] the total amount of money borrowed for the preliminary fund or the amount needed to complete the preliminary expenses, the surplus shall be placed in the general fund of the district and used to pay cost of construction, except that the same may be refunded or adjusted as hereinafter provided if deemed more just and so ordered by the court; provided, however, that if the district be dissolved the amount of surplus, if there be any, shall be prorated and refunded to the landowners paying such assessment.\n\nE. The information collected by the necessary surveys, the appraisals of benefits and damages and other information and data are hereby declared to constitute benefits for which said assessment may be levied. In case a district is dissolved or abandoned, before the work is constructed, the data, plans and estimates which have been secured shall be filed with the clerk of the court in which the district was organized, and shall be matters of public record available to anyone interested.\n\nHistory:Laws 1927, ch. 45, § 502; C.

Arch Hurley Conservancy Dist., 1938-NMSC-004, 42 N.M. 86, 75 P.2d 707.\n\nMillage assessment not constitutionally prohibited.— That this assessment was upon the millage basis did not bring it within the constitutional limitation of twenty mills for taxes on real and personal property.Hamilton v. Arch Hurley Conservancy Dist., 1938-NMSC-004, 42 N.M. 86, 75 P.2d 707.\n\nConstitutionality of former provisions.— Laws 1923, ch. 140, § 502 (repealed), which authorized preliminary assessments to defray the preliminary costs of surveys, plans and other incidental expenses, did not violate N.M.

Failure to pay the whole construction fund assessment within said period of sixty (60) days shall be conclusively considered and held an election on the part of all persons interested, whether under disability or otherwise, to pay such assessment in installments as hereinafter provided. All persons so electing to pay in installments, shall be conclusively held and considered as consenting to said official plan and all work thereunder, the issuance of bonds and the payment of interest thereon; and such election shall be conclusively held and considered as a waiver of any and all right to question the power or jurisdiction of the district to construct the works set forth in said official plan, the regularity or sufficiency of the proceedings or the validity or the correctness of such assessment; provided, however, that any public corporation may, within sixty (60) days, elect to pay, in whole or in part, the amount assessed against such corporation in not more than ten (10) annual installments, beginning at the time of the next annual levy of taxes by such corporation, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to relieve such corporation from liability for successive levies of assessments, not exceeding the amount of benefits appraised.\n\nC. In case of such election to pay in installments, the construction fund assessment shall be payable in not more than forty (40) annual installments of principal, the first of which installments shall be payable in five years and the last in not more than forty-five (45) years after the filing of the construction fund assessment record in the office of the district; with interest in all cases on the unpaid principal, computed and payable semiannually from the filing of the construction fund assessment record, at a rate not exceeding eight percent (8%) per annum, all as may be determined by the board by resolution.\n\nThe assessments against agricultural lands shall be so apportioned that no one of the first ten installments of the construction fund assessment shall exceed the sum of three dollars ($3.00) per acre.\n\nD.

In case such payments are tendered and accepted after bonds have been sold, the proceeds from such payments shall be used in the following prescribed manner to purchase and retire outstanding bonds of the district of the issue for which the assessment so paid had been levied. When an amount sufficient for the retirement of one or more bonds has been received, the board shall ask for and receive sealed bids from at least three reputable persons or firms on the number of bonds desired to be purchased. The bids shall state the number of bonds offered for sale, the serial number and maturity date of each such bond and the price including unpaid interest, at which the bond or bonds are offered.

Payment.\n\n(1) A sufficient amount of the assessments shall be appropriated by the board for the purpose of paying the principal and interest of bonds, and the same shall, when collected, be set apart in a separate fund for that purpose and no other. Any expenses incurred in the issuance and sale of the bonds and in paying bonds and interest thereon may be paid out of any funds in the hands of the treasurer.\n\n(2) The board, in making assessment levies as herein provided, shall take into account maturing bonds and interest on all bonds and shall make ample provision for the payment thereof. In case the proceeds of the original assessments made under the provisions of this act are not sufficient punctually to pay the principal of and the interest upon all bonds issued hereunder, then the board shall make such additional levy as may be necessary for such purposes. Under no circumstances shall any assessment levies be made that will in any manner or to any extent impair the security of any bond issued hereunder or the fund available for the payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon. No bond issued hereunder or the assessment made to pay the same shall have a priority of lien over any other bond issued or assessments made hereunder.\n\nD. District Treasurer.\n\n(1) The treasurer shall, prior to receiving and accepting the bonds as provided aforesaid and in addition to the bond required, at the time of taking office as provided by Section 73-14-35 NMSA 1978, furnish a corporation surety company bond at the expense of the district, executed to the district, conditioned that he shall account for and pay over as required by law and as ordered by the board, any money received by him on the sale of the bonds or from any other source and that he will sell and deliver the bonds to the purchaser thereof, under and according to the terms herein prescribed and not otherwise, and that he will, when ordered by the board, return to the board, duly canceled any and all bonds not sold; which bond shall be filed in the office of the clerk, who shall produce the same for inspection or for use as evidence whenever or wherever legally required.\n\n(2) The treasurer shall promptly report all sales of bonds to the board. The board shall issue warrants upon the treasurer at the proper time for the payment of the maturing bonds so sold and the interest payment coming due on all bonds sold, and the treasurer shall place sufficient funds at the place of payment to pay the same. In case warrants are not issued by the board as herein provided, then the treasurer shall of his own accord place funds at the place of payment, and the canceled bonds and coupons, if any, shall be accepted in lieu of such warrants.\n\n(3) The successor in office of any such treasurer shall not be entitled to the bonds or the proceeds thereof until he has complied with all the foregoing provisions applicable to his predecessor in office; provided, however, that if it should be deemed more expedient to the board, as to money derived from the sale of bonds issued or from any other source, the board may, by resolution, select some suitable bank or banks or other depository, which depository shall give good and sufficient bond, as temporary or assistant treasurer or treasurers, to hold and disburse the money on orders of the board as the work progresses, until such fund is exhausted or transferred to the treasurer by the order of the board. For such deposit, the district shall receive not less than two percent interest a year. The funds derived from the sale of bonds shall be used for the purpose of paying the cost of the works and improvements and such costs, expenses, fees and salaries as may be authorized by law and shall be used for no other purpose.\n\nE. Pledging.\n\n(1) If at the time when the bonds are ready to be issued the board is of the opinion that the bonds cannot advantageously be issued and sold in whole or in part, the board may sell parts only of the entire issue or may pledge not to exceed ten percent of the issue as collateral to a loan, but no partial sale or pledge shall be made without the order of the board made and entered of record, and no pledge shall be made at a greater margin than at the rate of one hundred dollars ($100) of bond principal for ninety dollars ($90.00) of loan.\n\n(2) The district may borrow money from the United States government and provide for the repayment thereof in the manner provided for the payment of bonds, and the board may make any necessary regulations to provide for such payment. The board may also pledge the bonds for the work done by the United States government in cooperation with the district.\n\nF. Validity.\n\n(1) This act shall, without reference to any other act of the legislature be full authority for the issuance and sale of the bonds in this act authorized, including refunding bonds; which bonds when executed and sealed in conformity with the provisions of this act and when sold or pledged in the manner prescribed herein and the consideration therefor received by the district, shall not be invalid for any irregularity or defect in the proceedings for the issue, sale or pledge thereof and shall be incontestable in the hands of the bona fide purchasers or holders thereof for value. No proceedings in respect to the issuance of any such bonds shall be necessary except such as are required by this act.\n\n(2) A party who has not sought a remedy against any proceeding under this act until after bonds have been sold shall not for any cause have an injunction against the collection of taxes or assessment for the payment of the bonds.\n\nG. Registration.\n\n(1) A district may, by recital in its coupon bonds, agree to register its coupon bonds either as to principal only or as to both principal and interest at the option of the bondholder. Whenever the owner of any coupon bond issued pursuant to the provisions of this act presents the bond to the treasurer or to such bank or other depository as the board may, for such purpose, designate as registrar, with a request for the conversion of the coupon bond into a registered bond, the treasurer, bank or other depository shall stamp, print or write upon the coupon bond so presented, either upon the back or the face thereof, as may be convenient, a statement to the effect that the bond is registered in the name of the owner and that thereafter the principal or the interest and principal of the bond are payable to the registered owner. Thereafter and from time to time, the bond may be transferred by the registered owner in person or by attorney duly authorized upon presentation of the bond for registration as before, a similar statement being stamped, printed or written thereon. Such statements stamped, printed or written upon any such bond may be substantially in the following form:\n\n\"This bond is registered in the name of (here insert name of owner) pursuant to the provisions of the Conservancy Act of New Mexico, and the interest and principal (or principal only) thereof are hereafter payable to such owner.\n\n........................................Treasurer (or registrar)\n\n...........................................Conservancy District.\n\nDate .........\"\n\n(2) When any bond is registered as aforesaid, the principal and interest of the bond shall be payable to the registered owner, except in the case of a coupon bond registered as to principal only, in which case the principal shall be payable to such person, unless the bond is discharged from registering by being registered as payable to bearer. Upon the registration of a coupon bond as to both principal and interest, the treasurer shall also cut off and cancel the coupons. The treasurer of the district shall enter in a register of bonds to be kept by him, or in a separate book, the fact of the registration of the bond and the name of the registered owner of the bond, so that the register or book shall at all times show what bonds are registered and the name of the registered owners.\n\nHistory:Laws 1927, ch. 45, § 506; C.S. 1929, § 30-506; 1941 Comp., § 77-2906; 1953 Comp., § 75-30-6; Laws 1983, ch. 265, § 59.\n\nCompiler's notes.— For the meaning of \"this act\",seecompiler's notes to 73-16-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the meaning of \"Conservancy Act\",seecompiler's notes following 73-14-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nCross references.— For definitions of \"board\" and \"clerk,\"see73-14-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor issuance of additional bonds,see73-16-33 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor Schedule Form IV,see73-17-24 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1983 amendment,effective April 7, 1983, in Subsection A(1), inserted \"in coupon or registered form\" and deleted \"in denominations of not less than one hundred ($100) dollars, bearing interest from date at a rate not to exceed six (6%) percent per annum, payable semiannually\" preceding \"to mature at annual intervals;\" in Subsection A(2), substituted \"The bonds may be payable to bearer or the registered owner and, except for bonds issued in book entry or similar form without the delivery of physical securities\" for \"Said bonds shall be payable to bearer\" in the second sentence and substituted \"Installments of interest may\" for \"The semiannual payments of interest shall\" in the third sentence; in Subsection B, rewrote completely the second sentence and deleted the beginning of the third sentence; in Subsection C(1), deleted the former second sentence; in Subsection C(2), divided the former second sentence into the present second and third sentences, and deleted \"or levies\" following \"additional levy\" in the second sentence; in Subsection D(1), substituted the New Mexico citation for \"Section 304\" and deleted \"or any of them\" following \"Sale of the bonds;\" in Subsection D(2), inserted \"if any\" in the last sentence; in Subsection D(3), substituted \"successor\" for \"successors\" in the first sentence, substituted \"a year\" for \"per annum\" in the second sentence and deleted \"or any of them\" following \"sale of bonds\" in the last sentence; in Subsection E(2), inserted \"money\" following \"district may borrow;\" in Subsection F(1) deleted \"of the state of New Mexico\" following \"legislature;\" in Subsection G, inserted \"coupon\" preceding \"bonds\" in three places in Paragraph (1), inserted \"principal or the\" preceding \"interest and principal\" in the second sentence of Paragraph (1), deleted the designation of Paragraph (2) preceding the sample bond form and substituted the present designation of Paragraph (2) for the former designation of Paragraph (3), inserted \"and principal\" following \"and the interest\" in the sample bond form and substituted \"When\" for \"If\" at the beginning of Paragraph (2); and made other minor changes.\n\nWhere exceeding interest limit immaterial.— In suit to enjoin sale of 51/2% conservancy bonds at 90% of total amount of construction fund assessments, where it appeared that the total payment of principal and interest, including discount, would not exceed what would have been required if the bonds had borne 6% interest and had brought par and accrued interest, the fact that the interest yield would exceed 6% was immaterial.Jacobson v.

It may be that it was. It is reasonably certain that collections for these assessments may not be made beyond 10 years.

Such bonds, except for bonds issued in book entry or similar form without the delivery of physical securities, shall be executed in the name and on behalf of the district and signed by the president of the board, with the seal of the district affixed thereto, and attested by the signature of the secretary. Installments of interest may be evidenced by coupons bearing the facsimile signature of the district treasurer. In case any officer whose signature or certificate appears upon bonds or coupons issued pursuant to Sections 73-16-50 through 73-16-53 NMSA 1978 ceases to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds, such signature or certificate shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until the delivery of the bonds. The coupon bonds may be registered either as to principal or interest or both, at the option of the holder, at the office of the district.\n\nHistory:Laws 1941, ch. 108, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 77-2949; 1953 Comp., § 75-30-49; Laws 1983, ch. 265, § 60.\n\nCompiler's notes.— For the meaning of \"Conservancy Act\",seecompiler's notes following 73-14-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nLaws 1941, ch. 108, was deemed to supersede Laws 1935, ch. 150, which authorized the issuance of refunding bonds to be in denominations of not less than $100, to bear interest at a rate not to exceed 6% and to mature within not more than 50 years.
