At the time of making its order organizing the district or at any time thereafter, the court, or board of judges as the case may be, in the manner provided shall appoint three appraisers (herein described and referred to as appraisers or the board of appraisers), whose term of office shall be until the appraisals of benefits and damages are filed and finally determined by court and whose duty it shall be to appraise the lands or other property within and without the district to be acquired for rights-of-way, reservoirs and other works of the district, and to appraise all benefits and damages accruing to all land within or without the district by reason of the execution of the official plan.\n\nB. Two of said appraisers shall be freeholders residing within the state of New Mexico, who may or may not own lands within said district. Each of the appraisers shall, before taking up his duties, take and subscribe to an oath that he will faithfully and impartially discharge his duties as such appraiser, and that he will make a true report of such work done by him.\n\nC. The said appraisers shall at their first meeting elect one of their own number chairman, and the secretary of the board or his deputy shall be ex-officio secretary of said board of appraisers during their continuance in office. A majority of the appraisers shall constitute a quorum, and a concurrence of the majority in any matter within their duties shall be sufficient for its determination.\n\nD. The court or board of judges as the case may be, shall fill all vacancies in the board of appraisers, or may appoint a new board, all in the manner provided, as occasion may require, which new board, if appointed, shall perform all the duties and exercise all the powers of the appraisers of the district.\n\nHistory:Laws 1927, ch. 45, § 401; C.S. 1929, § 30-401; 1941 Comp., § 77-2801; 1953 Comp., § 75-29-1.\n\nCross references.— For compensation of appraisers,see73-16-29 NMSA 1978.\n\nDuration and function of board of appraisers.— The board of appraisers is a tribunal continuing in character as long as there is work to be done, and their duties are to appraise only such damages as are contemplated by the statute (Laws 1927, ch. 45).Zamora v.

During the preparation of the official plan, the appraisers shall examine and become acquainted with the nature of the plans for the improvement and of the lands and other property affected thereby, in order that they may be better prepared to make appraisals.\n\nB. When the official plan is filed with the secretary he shall at once notify the appraisers, and they shall thereupon proceed to appraise the benefits of every kind to all land and property within or without the district, which will result from the organization of said district and the execution of the official plan, except as otherwise provided in Section 316 [73-14-47 NMSA 1978] of this act; and also to appraise the damages sutained [sustained], and the value of the land and other property necessary to be taken by the district for which settlement has not been made by the board. In the progress of their work, the appraisers shall have the assistance of the attorney, engineers, secretary and other agents and employees of the district.\n\nC. The appraisers shall also appraise the benefits and damages, if any, accruing to public corporations, as political entities, and to the state of New Mexico, and the same shall be taken and considered the same as benefits or damages, as the case may be, to land or other property, and to public health, safety, convenience and welfare.\n\nD. Before appraisals of compensation and damages are made, the board may report to the appraisers the parcels of land it may wish to purchase and for which it may wish appraisals to be made, both for easement and for purchase in fee simple, and the board may specify the particular purpose for which and the extent to which an easement in any property is desired, describing definitely such purpose and extent. Wherever instructed so to do by the board, appraisers shall appraise lands which it may be necessary or desirable for the district to own, and when instructed by the board so to do, they shall appraise both the total value of the land and also the damages due to an easement for the purposes of the district.\n\nUpon such appraisals being confirmed by the court, the board shall have the option of paying the entire appraised value of the property and acquiring full title to it in fee simple, or of paying only the cost of such easement. Upon written demand by the owner, such option shall be exercised by the board within ninety (90) days after the date of the final judicial determination of such appraisals.\n\nE. In appraising the value of property taken, no additional damages shall be allowed on account of any increase in value of property due to the execution of the official plan. The appraisers in appraising benefits and damages shall consider only the effect of the execution of the official plan.\n\nF. The appraisers shall appraise all damages which may, because of the execution of the official plan, accrue to real or other property, either within or without the district, which damages shall also cover easements acquired by the district for all of the purposes of the district, unless otherwise specifically stated.\n\nG. The appraisers in making appraisals shall give due consideration and credit to any other works or other systems of protection already constructed, or under construction, which form a useful part of the work of the district according to the official plan. Where the appraisers or a jury, in case one be called, return no appraisal of damages to any property, it shall be deemed a finding by them that no damages will be sustained.\n\nH. In determining the amount which each tract of land will be benefited by the improvements of the district, especially drainage systems, the appraisers shall consider the damage done to low land from seepage, and saturation by irrigation water from high land, and the necessity for the carrying off of waste water, and such high land shall be considered as being benefited to the extent and in the amount that such lands are responsible for damage to low lands from seepage and saturation by irrigation water.\n\nHistory:Laws 1927, ch. 45, § 402; C.S. 1929, § 30-402; 1941 Comp., § 77-2802; 1953 Comp., § 75-29-2.\n\nCompiler's notes.— For the meaning of \"this act\",seecompiler's notes to 73-14-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nConstitutionality of appraisal provisions.— This section and Sections 73-16-6 and 73-16-14 NMSA 1978 do not violate N.M.

In case the proposed alterations or additions materially modify the general character of the work; or materially modify the resulting damages; or materially reduce the benefits, for which the board is not able to make amicable settlement; or materially increase the benefits in such a manner as to require a new appraisal; or increase the total cost more than ten (10%) percent, above that estimated in the official plan; the court shall direct the appraisers (which may be the original board, or a new board appointed by the court on petition of the board of directors) to appraise the property to be taken, benefited or damaged by the proposed alterations or additions.\n\nD. Upon the completion of the report of the appraisers, notice shall be given and a hearing had on their report in the same manner as in the case of the original report of the appraisers; provided, that where a few property owners are affected, the clerk may, on order of the court, if found to be more economical and convenient, give personal notice as provided in said order of the pendency of the report of said appraisers, instead of notice by publication; and provided further, that when the only question at issue is additional damages or reduction of benefits to property, due to modification in or additions to the official plan, the board may, if practicable, make settlement with the owners of the property damaged, instead of having appraisals made by appraisers. In case such settlements are made, notice and hearing need not be had.\n\nE. After district bonds have been sold, as hereinafter provided, in order that their security may not be impaired, no reduction shall be made in the amount of uncontested benefits appraised or costs assessed against any property in the district; but in lieu of any reduction in assessment, if by reason of a modification in or addition to the official plan an excessive assessment is made under the provisions of Section 504 [73-16-4 NMSA 1978] hereof, the excess shall be paid to the property owner in cash. This provision shall apply to all changes in appraisals under this act.\n\nHistory:Laws 1927, ch. 45, § 412; C.S. 1929, § 30-412; 1941 Comp., § 77-2812; 1953 Comp., § 75-29-12.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCompiler's notes.— For the meaning of \"this act\",seecompiler's notes to 73-15-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nProvisions pertaining to appraisal of damages meandamages to property as in eminent domain proceedings, and not for negligent execution and operation of district's official plan.Zamora v.
