At the hearing before the board of county commissioners provided for in Section 73-12-3 NMSA 1978, the board shall proceed to determine whether the petition has been signed by the requisite number of petitioners; whether the lands in the proposed district are arid or semiarid lands; whether the lands are susceptible to irrigation and have a fertile soil that will warrant farming them by irrigation; whether there is a supply of water that can be made efficiently available for irrigation by the use of pumps; whether the proposed plan is practicable; and whether, on the whole, the development said to result from the introduction of power is of such interest and benefit to the whole district as to impress it with the character of public use. For the purpose of determining the public use of the operations of the proposed district and all other of the foregoing questions, the board of county commissioners is established as an inferior court and its decisions shall be binding upon all persons interested unless reversed on appeal as provided in this section, and if modified or affirmed, it shall be so binding.\n\nB. If the board of county commissioners hearing the matter determines that the petition has been signed by the requisite number of petitioners as required by Chapter 73, Article 12 NMSA 1978 and determines that the proposed development is of such interest and benefit to the whole district as to impress with the character of public use, it shall then proceed to hear any objections, exceptions and protests that have been made in writing to the organization of the district or to the inclusion of any lands within the district or to the exclusion of lands from the district and other objections, exceptions and protests as may be presented in writing to the organization of the district. All persons whose lands have not been included in the proposed district, as defined in the petition, have the right to appear before the board at the time and place as parties interested in or affected by the organization of the district and have the right to petition that their lands be included within the district, and, if it appears to the board that the inclusion of such lands may be made without materially increasing the cost of service, the commissioners may by order include such lands within the district.\n\nC. If the board makes findings approving of the organization of the district, it shall then proceed to define the boundaries of the proposed district from the petition and from applications in writing for the exclusion of lands and the inclusion of lands from and in the district, as may be made in accordance with the intent of Chapter 73, Article 12 NMSA 1978. The board may adjourn the meeting from time to time not exceeding three weeks in all and shall, by final order duly entered upon its records, allow the prayer of the petition and define and establish the boundaries of the proposed district. Provided that the board shall not modify the proposed boundaries described in the petition so as to change the objects of the petition or so as to exempt from the operation of Chapter 73, Article 12 NMSA 1978 any land within the boundaries proposed by the petition susceptible to irrigation by the same system or power works applicable to other lands in the proposed district. No land that will not, in the judgment of the board, be benefited by the proposed system shall be included in the district if its owner makes written application at the hearing to withdraw it.\n\nD. Any persons aggrieved by the decision of the board of county commissioners, upon the hearing provided for in this section, are given the right of appeal to the district court pursuant to the provisions of Section 39-3-1.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nE. When the petition has been allowed and the boundaries established and the name of the proposed district designated, which shall be ________ electrical district, the board of county commissioners shall, by further order duly entered upon its records, call an election of the qualified electors of the district to be held for the purpose of determining whether the district shall be organized under the provisions of Chapter 73, Article 12 NMSA 1978 and by such order shall submit the names of one or more persons from each of three divisions of the district, as provided in this section, to be voted for as directors therein, and for the purpose of the election shall divide the district into three divisions, as nearly equal in size as may be practicable, to be numbered, respectively, 1, 2 and 3 and shall provide that a qualified elector of each of the three divisions shall be elected as a member of the board of directors of the district by the qualified electors of the whole district.

A copy of such report shall be kept on file in the office of the state engineer and in the office of the board of directors of such district and shall be available for examination by any person desiring to do so.\n\nThe board of directors shall also, at the same time, fully investigate the manner by which power can be brought into or generated within or without the district so as to be efficiently distributed to the landowners for irrigation purposes and for such purpose shall employ a competent engineer, who shall report to said board, making recommendations as to the character of power to be used, the cost of securing such power whether by purchase of power or power plant or by construction of a plant with transmission lines or otherwise, and shall furnish an estimate of the cost of such power to the owners of such lands per acre-foot of water pumped. Such report accompanied by an examination fee of twenty-five ($25.00) dollars shall be submitted to the state engineer for his examination, and, if he shall find such report to be a full and complete report of the cost to the landowners of irrigation of his lands by the plan devised by said engineer and that it appears to be practicable to use such power for irrigation with the available water supply of the district, said state engineer shall approve such report and so certify under his hand and official seal. If such report submitted is found to be insufficient or incorrect, the state engineer shall return the same for correcting to the board of directors of the district with a statement of his objections. If such report is not corrected so as to meet with the approval of the state engineer or if from such report and other available information the engineer is of the opinion that the manner of securing power for irrigation purposes is too expensive to be practicable or is otherwise impracticable he shall disapprove said report.\n\nThe board of directors shall have the right to appeal from the decision of the state engineer to the district court of the district in which such irrigation district is located where the sufficiency and accuracy of the report and where the practicability of the manner of securing water, power or fuel shall be determined. Until the report is approved by the state engineer or the courts, no bond issue shall be made, as provided for in Section 15 [73-12-15 NMSA 1978] of this act. A copy of such report shall be kept on file in the office of the state engineer and the office of the board of directors of the said irrigation district and shall be available for examination by any person desiring to do so.\n\nSaid board shall have the power (in addition to the means to supply water to said district) to construct, acquire or purchase any and all canals, ditches, reservoirs, reservoir sites, water, water wells, water rights, rights-of-way, motors, engines, power plants, power transmission lines, gas and oil lines or other property necessary for the use of the district and to contract with any person or corporation for supplying water or for power or fuel to be used in pumping water for any or all of the lands and purposes in said district; and may lease its plant or transmission lines under a contract with any person or corporation for operation purposes, for the supplying to such district power for pumping and other purposes; and also to construct drainage works necessary to prevent or relieve waterlog or [of] any lands within the district. In case of the purchase of any property or the payment of any debt by said district, the bonds of the district, hereinafter provided for, may be used at their par value in payment without previous offer of such bonds for sale. But no contract involving any consideration exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and no contract for the purchase, rental or delivery or [of] water or power or fuel involving annual charges or payments exceeding fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) shall be binding unless such contracts shall be authorized and ratified in writing by not less than a majority of the qualified electors of said district according to the number of votes cast at the last preceding election; nor shall any contract involving payment in excess of twenty-five thousand ($25,000) dollars in one year be binding until such contract shall have been authorized and ratified by a majority of the votes at an election held in the manner provided for the issue of bonds.\n\nThe rules and regulations established by said board shall be printed in convenient form as soon as the same are adopted, for distribution in the district. All power distributed shall be at a uniform rate per killowatt [kilowatt] hour. The board of directors shall have power to supply and deliver power or fuel within or without said district to others than owners of land within the district at such price and on such terms as they deem best, provided the price received for power or fuel shall be not less than the price charged to the owners of land within the district plus a price or charge which will make the total price not less than the total cost to the owners of land within the district. Provided no power or fuel shall be supplied to any other than a landowner in said district unless there shall be available a surplus of power over and above that needed for the use of landowners within the irrigation district for pumping for irrigation purposes and for domestic uses.\n\nHistory:Laws 1929, ch. 76, § 12; C.S. 1929, § 73-712; Laws 1931, ch. 133, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 77-2412; 1953 Comp., § 75-25-12.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For authorization of bondholders to appoint director,see73-13-7 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor appeal to district court,see39-3-1 and 39-3-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor the qualifications and duties of the state engineer,see72-2-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor procedures governing administrative appeals to the district court,seeRule 1-074 NMRA.\n\nFor scope of review of the district court,seeZamora v.

The court may make a general order determining the question of benefits, except as to the issue raised by any landowner appearing, in which event there shall be a definite and specific finding as to benefits received by the land owned by such appearing landowner. The court in inquiring into the question of benefits received, the regularity, legality or correctness of said proceedings, must disregard any error, irregularity or omission, which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties to said special proceedings, or others whose rights or interests are involved in such proceedings. Upon issue joined the court shall hear the evidence, and the court may, by decree, determine the question of benefits and approve and confirm such proceedings in part, and disapprove and declare illegal or invalid other or subsequent parts thereof.\n\nIf the court finds that such proceedings have been legal and valid, and that the lands within said district will be benefited to an amount equal to the bonds proposed to be issued, and the tax necessary to be levied for the payment thereof and delinquencies thereon, as in this act provided, it shall, by decree, approve and confirm the same and declare the tax to be levied and the bonds issued and sold or to be issued or sold thereunder, to be valid. And if the court finds any part of such proceedings for the organization of the district, or for the levy of the tax, or for the issue and sale of bonds or other purposes of the district to be illegal, invalid or insufficient, it may direct such proceedings or action to be taken as will remedy the defects in the former proceedings. And upon presentation to the court of satisfactory evidence that such action or proceedings have been duly taken as directed the court may by its decree approve and confirm said proceedings and declare said bonds to be valid. The costs of the special proceedings may be allowed and apportioned between the parties in the discretion of the court.\n\nThe judgment or decree when finally made and entered shall be res judicata in all cases arising in connection with the organization of the district and the levy and collection of taxes for payment of the principal or interest of the bonds or of moneys due under contracts or obligations of the district, including the question of benefits received by each tract of land within said district.\n\nHistory:Laws 1929, ch. 76, § 55; C.S. 1929, § 73-755; 1941 Comp., § 77-2455; 1953 Comp., § 75-25-55.",
