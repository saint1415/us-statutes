A district board may pledge irrevocably for the payment of interest, principal and premium, if any, on refunding bonds the appropriate pledged revenues, which may be pledged to an original issue of bonds.\n\nC. Refunding bonds may be issued separately or in combination in one series or more.\n\nD. Refunding bonds shall be authorized by resolution. Bonds that are refunded shall be paid at maturity or on any permitted prior redemption date in the amounts, at the time and places and, if called prior to maturity, in accordance with any applicable notice provisions, all as provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the refunded bonds or otherwise appertaining thereto, except for any such bond that is voluntarily surrendered for exchange or payment by the holder or owner.\n\nE.

This section does not require the establishment of an escrow if the refunded bonds and the amounts necessary to retire the refunded bonds within that time are deposited with the paying agent for the refunded bonds.
