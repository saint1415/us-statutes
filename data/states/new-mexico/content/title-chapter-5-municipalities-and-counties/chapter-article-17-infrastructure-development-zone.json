Notice of hearing shall be provided by publication of a notice at least thirty days in advance of the hearing itself. The notice shall include the following:\n\n(1) a description of the method by which the amount of the proposed special assessment will be determined for each class of property to which the levy is proposed to apply, in sufficient detail to enable the owner of the affected parcel to determine the amount of the special assessment;\n\n(2) a description of the project to be financed with special assessment bonds or revenues; and\n\n(3) a statement that any person affected by the proposed special assessment may object in writing or in person at the hearing.\n\nC. After a hearing on the proposed special assessment and the issuance of special assessment bonds, the board shall, based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, issue a decision as to whether to impose a special assessment and, if so, the method of assessment for each class of property and the project to be financed thereby. The decision shall also respond to each objection to the assessment raised at the hearing.\n\nD. Special assessment bonds may be sold in a public offering or in a negotiated sale.\n\nE. After the bonds are issued, the board shall enter in its minutes a record of the bonds sold and their numbers and dates, and shall annually impose and cause a special assessment to be collected, at the same time and in the same manner as property taxes are levied and collected on all property within the infrastructure development zone that may be subject to the assessment, including all leased property or improvements to leased land, sufficient, together with any other money lawfully available to pay debt service on the bonds when due, except to the extent that the board has provided for other imposition, collection and foreclosure procedures in connection with special assessments. Money derived from the imposition of the special assessment when collected that is pledged to pay the debt service on the bonds shall be kept separately from other funds of the infrastructure development zone. Special assessment revenues not pledged to pay debt service on bonds may be used to pay other costs of the infrastructure development zone, including costs of organization, administration, operation and maintenance, service or enhanced services.\n\nF.

A change in the amount of a special assessment imposed upon a parcel due to a change in its size or use shall not require voter approval if the method for changing the amount of special assessment was approved in the election approving the special assessment in sufficient detail to enable the owner of the affected parcel to determine how the change in size or use of the parcel would affect the amount of the special assessment.\n\nH. An infrastructure development zone's imposition of a special assessment shall constitute a lien on the property within the infrastructure development zone subject to the special assessment, including property acquired by the state or its political subdivisions after imposition of the special assessment, which shall be effective during the period in which the special assessment is imposed and shall have priority co-equal to the lien of property taxes. A special assessment shall be subject to foreclosure by the infrastructure development zone at any time after six months following written notice of delinquency to the owner of the real property to which the delinquency applies. The lien shall include delinquencies, penalties and interest thereon at a rate not to exceed the maximum legal rate of interest per year and penalties otherwise applicable for delinquent property taxes, the infrastructure development zone's actual costs of foreclosure and any other costs of the infrastructure development zone resulting from the delinquency. All rights of redemption applicable to property sold in connection with property tax foreclosures pursuant to the laws of this state shall apply to property sold following foreclosure of a special assessment lien. The portion of proceeds of any foreclosure sale necessary to discharge the lien for the special assessment shall be deposited in the special bond fund for payment of any obligations secured thereby.\n\nI. No holder of special assessment bonds issued pursuant to the Infrastructure Development Zone Act may compel any exercise of the taxing power of the infrastructure development zone, municipality or county to pay the bonds or the interest on the bonds. Special assessment bonds issued pursuant to that act are not a debt of the infrastructure development zone, municipality or county, nor is the payment of special assessment bonds enforceable out of any money other than the revenue pledged to the payment of the bonds.\n\nJ.

      "text": "A. At any time after the organization of the infrastructure development zone, the board may hold a hearing on the question of authorizing the board to issue one or more series of revenue bonds of the infrastructure development zone to provide money for any public infrastructure purposes consistent with the service plan.\n\nB. If revenue bonds are approved by resolution, the board may issue and sell revenue bonds of the infrastructure development zone.\n\nC. The revenue bonds may be sold in a public offering or in a negotiated sale; however, if the bonds are to be sold in a public offering, no revenue bonds may be issued by the infrastructure development zone unless the revenue bonds receive one of the four highest investment grade ratings by a nationally recognized bond rating agency.\n\nD. The board may pledge to the payment of its revenue bonds any revenues of the infrastructure development zone or revenues to be collected by the municipality or county in trust for the infrastructure development zone and returned to the infrastructure development zone.\n\nE. The infrastructure development zone shall prescribe fees and charges, and shall revise them when necessary, to generate revenue sufficient, together with any money from the sources described in Section 26 [5-17-26 NMSA 1978] of the Infrastructure Development Zone Act, to pay when due the principal and interest of all revenue bonds for the payment of which revenue has been pledged. The establishment or revision of any rates, fees and charges shall be identified and noticed concurrently with the annual budget process of the infrastructure development zone pursuant to Section 32 [5-17-32 NMSA 1978] of the Infrastructure Development Zone Act.\n\nF. If, in the resolution of the board, the revenues to be pledged are limited to certain types of revenues, only those types of revenues may be pledged and only those revenues shall be maintained.\n\nG. No holder of revenue bonds issued pursuant to the Infrastructure Development Zone Act may compel any exercise of the taxing power of the infrastructure development zone, municipality or county to pay the bonds or the interest on the bonds. Revenue bonds issued pursuant to that act are not a debt of the infrastructure development zone, municipality or county, nor is the payment of revenue bonds enforceable out of any money other than the revenue pledged to the payment of the bonds.\n\nH. Subject to the requirements of this section, an infrastructure development zone may issue revenue bonds at such times and in such amounts as the board deems appropriate to carry out a project in phases.\n\nI. Pursuant to this section, the infrastructure development zone may issue and sell refunding bonds to refund revenue bonds of the infrastructure development zone authorized by the Infrastructure Development Zone Act. Refunding bonds issued pursuant to this section shall have a final maturity date no later than the final maturity date of the bonds being refunded.\n\nHistory:Laws 2009, ch. 136, § 30.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2009, ch. 136 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M.

The bonds may be sold by competitive bid or negotiated sale for public or private offering at, below or above par. The proceeds of the bonds shall be deposited with the treasurer, or with a trustee or agent designated by the board, to the credit of the infrastructure development zone to be withdrawn for the purposes provided by the Infrastructure Development Zone Act. Pending that use, the proceeds may be invested as determined by the board. The bonds shall be made payable as to both principal and interest solely from revenues of the infrastructure development zone, and shall specify the revenues pledged for such purposes, and shall contain such other terms, conditions, covenants and agreements as the board deems proper.
