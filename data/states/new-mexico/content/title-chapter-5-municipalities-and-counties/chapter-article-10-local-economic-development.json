The legislature finds that:\n\n(1) development of the New Mexico economy is vital to the well-being of the state and its residents;\n\n(2) it is difficult for municipalities and counties in New Mexico to attract and retain businesses capable of enhancing the local and state economy without the resources necessary to compete with other states and locales;\n\n(3) municipalities and counties may need to be able to provide land, buildings and infrastructure as a tool for basic business growth and the introduction of basic business ventures into the state;\n\n(4) it is in the best interest of the state, municipalities and counties to encourage local or regional solutions to economic development; and\n\n(5) the access to public resources needs to be carefully controlled and managed for the continued and future benefit of New Mexico citizens.\n\nB. The purpose of the Local Economic Development Act is to implement the provisions of the 1994 constitutional amendment to Article 9, Section 14 of the constitution of New Mexico to allow public support of economic development to foster, promote and enhance local economic development efforts while continuing to protect against the unauthorized use of public money and other public resources. Further, the purpose of that act is to allow municipalities and counties to enter into joint powers agreements to plan and support regional economic development projects, including investments in arts and cultural districts created pursuant to the Arts and Cultural District Act [15-5A-1 to 15-5A-7 NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:Laws 1993, ch. 297, § 2; 2007, ch. 160, § 8.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective July 1, 2007, provided that a purpose of the Local Economic Development Act was to permit municipalities and counties to support arts and cultural districts created pursuant to the Arts and Cultural District Act.",

Const., Art. IX, § 14, prohibits the state, a county, school district, or municipality from making any donation to or in aid of any person, association or public or private corporation, with certain exceptions; among the exceptions to the anti-donation clause's prohibition is N.M. Const., Art. IX, § 14(D), which allows a state, county, or municipality to create new job opportunities by providing \"land, buildings or infrastructure\" for facilities to support new or expanding businesses. The Local Economic Development Act, 5-10-1 to 5-10-17 NMSA 1978, was enacted to implement N.M. Const., Art. IX, § 14(D), and authorizes a local government to provide public support for economic development projects permitted by N.M. Const., Art. IX, § 14(D). As commonly understood and used by the legislature, however, \"land, buildings or infrastructure\" do not include water rights or the acquisition of water rights, and therefore, an agreement between the New Mexico economic development department and the village of Los Lunas, under which the state will provide funding for the acquisition of consumptive use water rights and the equivalency in water credits for a Facebook data center project in Los Lunas, New Mexico, would be in violation of the anti-donation clause and the Local Economic Development Act. The acquisition of water rights is not included among the permissible uses of public money under the Local Economic Development Act or the New Mexico constitution.Purchase of Water Rights under the Local Economic Development Act(11/13/18), Att'y Gen.
