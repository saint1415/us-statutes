Subject to the provisions of Subsection C of this section, an anatomical gift by a person authorized pursuant to Section 9 of the Jonathan Spradling Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act may be amended or revoked orally or in a record by any member of a prior class who is reasonably available. If more than one member of the prior class is reasonably available, the gift made by a person authorized pursuant to Section 9 of that act may be:\n\n(1) amended only if a majority of the reasonably available members agree to the amending of the gift; or\n\n(2) revoked only if a majority of the reasonably available members agree to the revoking of the gift or if they are equally divided as to whether to revoke the gift.\n\nC. A revocation pursuant to Subsection B of this section is effective only if, before an incision has been made to remove a part from the donor's body or before invasive procedures have begun to prepare the recipient, the procurement organization, transplant hospital or physician or technician knows of the revocation.\n\nHistory:Laws 2007, ch. 323, § 10.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2007, ch. 323, § 36 made the Jonathan Spradling Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act effective July 1, 2007.",

If an anatomical gift to an individual pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of this section cannot be transplanted into the individual, the part passes in accordance with Subsection G of this section in the absence of an express, contrary indication by the person making the anatomical gift.\n\nC. If an anatomical gift of one or more specific parts or of all parts is made in a document of gift that does not name a person described in Subsection A of this section but identifies the purpose for which an anatomical gift may be used, the following rules apply:\n\n(1) if the part is an eye and the gift is for the purpose of transplantation or therapy, the gift passes to the appropriate eye bank;\n\n(2) if the part is tissue and the gift is for the purpose of transplantation or therapy, the gift passes to the appropriate tissue bank;\n\n(3) if the part is an organ and the gift is for the purpose of transplantation or therapy, the gift passes to the appropriate organ procurement organization as custodian of the organ; and\n\n(4) if the part is an organ, an eye or tissue and the gift is for the purpose of research or education, the gift passes to the appropriate procurement organization.\n\nD. For the purpose of Subsection C of this section, if there is more than one purpose of an anatomical gift set forth in the document of gift but the purposes are not set forth in any priority, the gift shall be used for transplantation or therapy, if suitable.

If an anatomical gift of one or more specific parts is made in a document of gift that does not name a person described in Subsection A of this section and does not identify the purpose of the gift, the gift may be used only for transplantation or therapy, and the gift passes in accordance with Subsection G of this section.\n\nF. If a document of gift specifies only a general intent to make an anatomical gift by words such as \"donor\", \"organ donor\" or \"body donor\", or by a symbol or statement of similar import, the gift may be used only for transplantation or therapy and the gift passes in accordance with Subsection G of this section.\n\nG. For purposes of Subsections B, E and F of this section, the following rules apply:\n\n(1) if the part is an eye, the gift passes to the appropriate eye bank;\n\n(2) if the part is tissue, the gift passes to the appropriate tissue bank; and\n\n(3) if the part is an organ, the gift passes to the appropriate organ procurement organization as custodian of the organ.\n\nH. An anatomical gift of an organ for transplantation or therapy, other than an anatomical gift pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of this section, passes to the organ procurement organization as custodian of the organ.\n\nI. If an anatomical gift does not pass pursuant to Subsections A through H of this section or the decedent's body or part is not used for transplantation, therapy, research or education, custody of the body or part passes to the person under obligation to dispose of the body or part.\n\nJ. A person may not accept an anatomical gift if the person knows that the gift was not effectively made pursuant to Section 24-6B-5 or 24-6B-10 NMSA 1978 or if the person knows that the decedent made a refusal pursuant to Section 24-6B-7 NMSA 1978 that was not revoked.

Unless prohibited by law other than the Jonathan Spradling Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, at any time after a donor's death, the person to which a part passes pursuant to Section 11 [24-6B-11 NMSA 1978] of that act may conduct any reasonable examination necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the body or part for its intended purpose.\n\nE.

      "text": "A. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"covered entity\" means an organ procurement organization, hospital, transplant hospital, physician, insurance company or plan or health maintenance organization; and\n\n(2) \"disability\" means a severe chronic physical or mental impairment that results in substantial functional limitations in one or more of the following areas of major life activity:\n\n(a) self-care;\n\n(b) receptive and expressive language;\n\n(c) learning;\n\n(d) mobility;\n\n(e) self-determination; and\n\n(f) capacity for independent living.\n\nB. The provisions of this section apply to all stages of the transplant process.\n\nC. A covered entity shall not discriminate against a person with a disability in the receipt of an anatomical gift and shall not, solely on the basis of a person's disability:\n\n(1) consider the person ineligible to receive an anatomical gift;\n\n(2) deny transplantation-related services;\n\n(3) refuse to refer the person to an organ procurement organization, transplant hospital or other related specialist for the purpose of being evaluated for or receiving an anatomical gift;\n\n(4) refuse to place an otherwise qualified recipient on an anatomical gift waiting list;\n\n(5) place an otherwise qualified recipient on an anatomical gift waiting list at a lower priority position than the position at which the recipient would have been placed if the recipient did not have a disability; or\n\n(6) refuse insurance coverage for any procedures associated with being evaluated for or receiving an anatomical gift, including post-surgical medical care.\n\nD. A covered entity may take a person's disability into account when making treatment recommendations or decisions only to the extent that the disability has been found by a physician to be medically significant to the provision of the anatomical gift after an individualized evaluation of the person. If a person with a disability has the necessary support system to assist the person in complying with post-surgical medical requirements, a covered entity shall not consider the person's inability to independently comply with post-surgical medical requirements to be medically significant.\n\nE. A person affected by a violation of the provisions of this section may commence a civil action in district court.\n\nF. Nothing in this section is intended to limit or replace available remedies under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or other applicable law.\n\nHistory:Laws 2023, ch. 171, § 2.\n\nEmergency clauses.— Laws 2023, ch. 171, § 7 contained an emergency clause and was approved April 5, 2023.",
