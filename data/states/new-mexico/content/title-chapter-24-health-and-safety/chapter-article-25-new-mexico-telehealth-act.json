      "text": "A. The legislature finds that:\n\n(1) lack of primary care, specialty providers and transportation continue to be significant barriers to access to health services in medically underserved rural areas;\n\n(2) there are parts of this state where it is difficult to attract and retain health professionals, as well as to support local health facilities in providing a continuum of health care;\n\n(3) many health care providers in medically underserved areas are isolated from mentors and colleagues and from the information resources necessary to support them personally and professionally;\n\n(4) using information technology to deliver medical services and information from one location to another is part of a multifaceted approach to address the problems of provider distribution and the development of health systems in medically underserved areas by improving communication capabilities and providing convenient access to up-to-date information, consultations and other forms of support;\n\n(5) the use of telecommunications to deliver health services has the potential to reduce costs, improve quality, change the conditions of practice and improve access to health care in rural, medically underserved areas; and\n\n(6) telehealth will assist in maintaining or improving the physical and economic health of medically underserved communities by keeping the source of general health, behavioral health and oral health care in the local area, strengthening the health infrastructure and preserving health-care-related jobs.\n\nB. The purpose of the New Mexico Telehealth Act is to provide a framework for health care providers to follow in providing telehealth services to New Mexico citizens in a manner that provides efficient and effective access to quality health services. Telehealth services include consultations, direct patient care and education for health care professionals, support personnel, students, families, patients and other consumers of health care services.\n\nHistory:Laws 2004, ch. 48, § 2; 2007, ch. 203, § 2.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, provided that telehealth services include consultations, direct patient care and education for health care professionals, support personnel, students, families, patients and other consumers of health care services.",
