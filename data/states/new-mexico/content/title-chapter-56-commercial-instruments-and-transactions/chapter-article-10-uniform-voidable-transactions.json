in the introductory sentence, deleted \"Fraudulent Transfer\" and added \"Voidable Transactions\"; throughout the section, after \"person\", changed \"who\" to \"that\"; in Subsection A, Paragraph (1)(b), after \"not\", added \"in fact\"; in Subsection A, Paragraph (2)(a), after \"sole\", added \"discretionary\"; in Subsection C, after \"'claim'\", added \"except when used in the phrase 'claim for relief'\"; added Subsection G and redesignated former Subsections G and H as Subsections H and I, respectively; added Subsection J; redesignated former Subsection I as Subsection K; in Subsection K, after \"individual\", deleted \"partnership, corporation, association, organization, government or governmental subdivision or agency, business trust, estate, trust or any other legal or commercial entity\" and added \"an estate, a business or nonprofit entity, a public corporation, a government or governmental subdivision, agency or instrumentality or another legal entity\";

Jones, 184 Bankr. 377 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1995).\n\n\"Transfer\".— A quitclaim deed is a conveyance of title, and therefore is a \"transfer\" under this article.Mazer v. Jones, 184 Bankr. 377 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1995).\n\nOwnership of asset.— Given the debtors' failure to segregate the trailer park from their assets at any material time or to trace the money that allegedly funded a trust for their children, there was no factual basis on which the court could conclude that a trust should be imposed; the debtors acquired equitable title to the trailer park at the time of purchase and it was their \"asset\" at the time of any purported transfer.Mazer v.

      "text": "A. A debtor is insolvent if, at a fair valuation, the sum of the debtor's debts is greater than the sum of the debtor's assets.\n\nB. A debtor that is generally not paying the debtor's debts as they become due other than as a result of a bona fide dispute is presumed to be insolvent. The presumption imposes on the party against which the presumption is directed the burden of proving that the nonexistence of insolvency is more probable than its existence.\n\nC. Assets under this section do not include property that has been transferred, concealed or removed with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or that has been transferred in a manner making the transfer voidable under the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act.\n\nD. Debts under this section do not include an obligation to the extent it is secured by a valid lien on property of the debtor not included as an asset.\n\nHistory:Laws 1989, ch. 382, § 3; 2015, ch. 54, § 11.\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective January 1, 2016, substituted \"Uniform Voidable Transactions Act\" for reference to the former Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act and clarified the meaning of \"insolvency\"; in Subsection A, after \"insolvent if,\", added \"at a fair valuation\", after \"than\", deleted \"all\" and added \"the sum\", and after \"assets\", deleted \"at a fair valuation\"; in Subsection B, after \"debtor\", deleted \"who\" and added \"that\", after \"paying\", deleted \"his\" and added \"the debtor's\", after \"due\", added \"other than as a result of a bona fide dispute\", and after \"insolvent.\", added the last sentence; deleted Subsection C, relating to an insolvent partnership, and redesignated former Subsections D and E as Subsections C and D, respectively; and in Subsection C, after \"Uniform\", deleted \"Fraudulent Transfer\" and added \"Voidable Transactions\".\n\nPurpose of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act is to protect creditorswhen a debtor has made a conveyance of his property which diminishes the creditor's assets to the detriment of the rights of the creditor.Michel v. J's Foods, Inc., 1983-NMSC-019, 99 N.M. 574, 661 P.2d 474.\n\nInsolvency essential element.— To proceed under a theory of fraudulent conveyance, certain essential elements must be alleged and proved. Among these elements is the intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. Another element is the insolvency of the debtor. Allegation and proof of the commonly accepted badges of fraud can also be used to establish a fraudulent conveyance.American Cas. Co. v. Line Materials Indus., 332 F.2d 393 (10th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 960, 85 S. Ct. 646, 13 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1965).\n\nBoth insolvency and lack of consideration required.— This section clearly requires that both insolvency and lack of fair consideration be proven in order that a debtor's acts amount to fraud upon his creditors.First Nat'l Bank v. Abraham, 1982-NMSC-006, 97 N.M. 288, 639 P.2d 575.\n\n\"Badges of fraud\".— Among the commonly recognized badges of fraud are: the insolvency or indebtedness of the debtor, the lack of consideration for the conveyance, the retention by the grantor of possession of the property, the close relationship between the transferor and the transferee and the threat or pendency of litigation.First Nat'l Bank v. Abraham, 1982-NMSC-006, 97 N.M. 288, 639 P.2d 575.\n\nConveyance by insolvent debtors without consideration fraudulent.— The assigning of mining leases to the corporation in return for which the corporation issued original stock in the names of the children, the insolvency of the judgment debtor and the failure of consideration from the children placed the transaction neatly within the language of this section.Atlas Corp. v. DeVilliers, 447 F.2d 799 (10th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 933, 92 S. Ct. 939, 30 L. Ed. 2d 809,reh'g denied, 405 U.S. 1033, 92 S. Ct. 1288, 31 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1972).\n\nWhere a husband who has become legally insolvent and whose tax difficulties have become apparent, effects a conveyance without consideration whereby husband and wife, holding as joint tenants, title to the residence to a trustee who then deeds it back to wife as the sole owner, the conveyance is in fraud of the rights of the United States under this section.United States v. Eaves, 499 F.2d 869 (10th Cir. 1974).\n\nPrior loans and services fair consideration.— Conveyance of stock is not a fraudulent transfer where assignee receives his assignment from judgment debtor in consideration of prior loans and services.Atlas Corp. v. DeVilliers, 447 F.2d 799 (10th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 933, 92 S. Ct. 939, 30 L. Ed. 2d 809,reh'g denied, 405 U.S. 1033, 92 S. Ct. 1288, 31 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1972).\n\nFair salable value of corporation's assets not reflected by \"forced-sale\" auction.— An auction, due to its \"forced sale\" nature whose terms were \"without reserve,\" did not reflect the fair salable value of a corporation's assets at the time of their conveyance to the debtor, which took place one year prior to the auction. Substantial evidence supported the finding that the corporation was not insolvent before or immediately after the prior conveyance of its assets.Allied Prods. Corp. v. Arrow Freightways, Inc., 1986-NMSC-062, 104 N.M. 544, 724 P.2d 752.\n\nSetting aside conveyance of radio license subject to FCC approval.— In an action to set aside the transfer of a radio license as a fraudulent conveyance, the trial court's order that the conveyance be set aside subject to FCC approval did not infringe FCC jurisdiction to make radio license determinations.Beagles v. Espinoza, 1990-NMCA-121, 111 N.M. 206, 803 P.2d 1111.\n\nCourt error in determining assets of insolvents.Western Prod. Credit Ass'n v.

Value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied, but value does not include an unperformed promise made otherwise than in the ordinary course of the promisor's business to furnish support to the debtor or another person.\n\nB. For the purposes of Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of Section 56-10-18 and Section 56-10-19 NMSA 1978, a person gives a reasonably equivalent value if the person acquires an interest of the debtor in an asset pursuant to a regularly conducted, noncollusive foreclosure sale or execution of a power of sale for the acquisition or disposition of the interest of the debtor upon default under a mortgage, deed of trust or security agreement.\n\nC. A transfer is made for present value if the exchange between the debtor and the transferee is intended by them to be contemporaneous and is in fact substantially contemporaneous.\n\nHistory:Laws 1989, ch. 382, § 4; 2015, ch. 54, § 12.\n\nThe 2015 amendment,effective January 1, 2016, in Subsection B, after \"Section\", deleted \"5 and Section 6 of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act\" and added \"56-10-18 and Section 56-10-19 NMSA 1978\".\n\nValue not given.— The children did not give value since they exchanged no property as consideration for the transfers and, absent any accounting, there was no showing of the existence of an antecedent debt.Mazer v.

A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is voidable as to a creditor, whether the creditor's claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation:\n\n(1) with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any creditor of the debtor; or\n\n(2) without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation, and the debtor:\n\n(a) was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction; or\n\n(b) intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should have believed that the debtor would incur, debts beyond the debtor's ability to pay as they became due.\n\nB. In determining actual intent under Paragraph (1) of Subsection A of this section, consideration may be given, among other factors, to whether:\n\n(1) the transfer or obligation was to an insider;\n\n(2) the debtor retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer;\n\n(3) the transfer or obligation was disclosed or concealed;\n\n(4) before the transfer was made or obligation was incurred, the debtor has been sued or threatened with suit;\n\n(5) the transfer was of substantially all the debtor's assets;\n\n(6) the debtor absconded;\n\n(7) the debtor removed or concealed assets;\n\n(8) the value of the consideration received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred or the amount of the obligation incurred;\n\n(9) the debtor was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred;\n\n(10) the transfer occurred shortly before or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred; and\n\n(11) the debtor transferred the essential assets of the business to a lienor who transferred the assets to an insider of the debtor.\n\nC.

Corp. v. C.V. Consultants & Assocs., 2008-NMCA-057, 144 N.M. 55, 183 P.3d 940.\n\nNo intent to hinder, delay or defraud.— Where the transferee guaranteed a loan so that the debtor could purchase and develop property; the debtor transferred the property to the transferee when the debtor could not pay the loan; the debtor was released from liability on the loan; and the transferee gave a mortgage on the property to the bank to secure his obligation to pay the loan, substantial evidence supported the finding that the debtor did not transfer the property to the transferee with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud the creditor.Ellen Equip.
