A consumer reporting agency need not release a credit report within the time periods set forth in Subsection E of this section if:\n\n(1) the consumer fails to meet the requirements of Subsection D of this section; or\n\n(2) the consumer reporting agency's ability to remove the security freeze within fifteen minutes is prevented by:\n\n(a) an act of God, including fire, earthquake, hurricane, storm or similar natural disaster or phenomenon;\n\n(b) unauthorized or illegal acts by a third party, including terrorism, sabotage, riots, vandalism, labor strikes or disputes disrupting operations or similar occurrences;\n\n(c) operational interruption, including electrical failure, unanticipated delay in equipment or replacement part delivery, computer hardware or software failure inhibiting response time or similar disruption;\n\n(d) governmental action, including emergency orders or regulations, judicial or law enforcement actions or similar directives;\n\n(e) regularly scheduled maintenance of, or updates to, the consumer reporting agency's systems during other than normal business hours; or\n\n(f) commercially reasonable maintenance of, or repair to, the consumer reporting agency's systems that is unexpected or unscheduled.\n\nG.

You may submit a declaration of removal to remove information placed in your credit report as a result of being a victim of identity theft. You have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report or submit a declaration of removal pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting and Identity Security Act.\n\nThe security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any information in your credit report without your express authorization or approval.\n\nThe security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without your consent. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, you will be provided with a personal identification number, password or similar device to use if you choose to remove the freeze on your credit report or to temporarily authorize the release of your credit report to a specific party or parties or for a specific period of time after the freeze is in place. To remove the freeze or to provide authorization for the temporary release of your credit report, you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide all of the following:\n\n(1) the unique personal identification number, password or similar device provided by the consumer reporting agency;\n\n(2) proper identification to verify your identity;\n\n(3) information regarding the third party or parties who are to receive the credit report or the period of time for which the credit report may be released to users of the credit report; and\n\n(4) payment of a fee, if applicable.\n\nA consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to lift temporarily a freeze on a credit report shall comply with the request no later than three business days after receiving the request.
