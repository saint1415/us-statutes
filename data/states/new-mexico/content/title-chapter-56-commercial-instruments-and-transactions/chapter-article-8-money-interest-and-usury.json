      "text": "The rate of interest, in the absence of a written contract fixing a different rate, shall be not more than fifteen percent annually in the following cases:\n\nA. on money due by contract;\n\nB. on money received to the use of another and retained without the owner's consent expressed or implied; and\n\nC. on money due upon the settlement of matured accounts from the day the balance is ascertained.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 56-8-3, enacted by Laws 1983, ch. 254, § 1.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1983, Chapter 254, § 1 repealed and reenacted 56-8-3 NMSA 1978. For prior history,seeLaws 1851-1852, p. 254; C.L. 1865, ch. 79, § 4; C.L. 1884, § 1734; C.L. 1897, § 2550; Code 1915, § 3525; C.S. 1929, § 89-103; 1941 Comp., § 53-603; 1953 Comp., § 50-6-3; Laws 1980, ch. 68, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For interest rate on open accounts in commercial houses,see56-8-5 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor exemption from limits of interest rate on National Housing Act loans,see58-8-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Annotations to decisions under prior versions of Section 56-8-3 NMSA 1978 and their predecessors (which contained various legal rates of interest) appear in the annotations to decisions under this section.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nApplication to prejudgment interest.— This section, by its own terms, applies only in those actions on a contract where the contract is silent as to prejudgment interest.D.J. Simmons, Inc. v. Broaddus, 116 Fed. Appx. 964.\n\nApplicability.— This statute applies to all judgments and decrees. The references to contracts in the statute simply clarifies that a contract could always set a different rate of interest, which a judgment was to follow.Folz v. State, 1993-NMCA-066, 115 N.M. 639, 857 P.2d 39, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 602, 856 P.2d 250.\n\nThis section does not use the term \"damages\".Instead it refers to \"money due by contract\".Aspen Landscaping, Inc. v. Longford Homes of N.M., Inc., 2004-NMCA-063, 135 N.M. 607, 92 P.3d 53, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-005, 135 N.M. 565, 92 P.3d 10.\n\nSection inapplicable when neither contract nor judgment involved.— This section is inapplicable where the trial court, sitting in equity, is not awarding money due on a contract and there is no money due \"on a judgment.\"El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. W. Bldg. Assocs., 675 F.2d 1135 (10th Cir. 1982).\n\n1980 amendment inapplicable to complaint filed prior thereto.— The increase in the interest rate from 6 percent to 10 percent enacted in 1980 does not apply to a complaint filed prior to 1980.Strickland v. Roosevelt County Rural Elec. Coop., 1982-NMCA-184, 99 N.M. 335, 657 P.2d 1184, cert. denied, 99 N.M. 358, 658 P.2d 433 (1983), and cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1209, 103 S. Ct. 3540, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1390 (1983).\n\nInapplicable when written contract fixes different rate.— Where a written contract fixing a different rate existed between the parties, there is no applicability of this section.Skarda v. Davis, 1973-NMSC-011, 84 N.M. 544, 505 P.2d 1220.\n\nInapplicable when written contract provides \"no interest\".— Where express provision of contract stipulated that part of obligation payable in annual installments was to bear no interest, there is no place for the operation of any implied contract to pay interest, regardless of how the statutory term \"due\" used in this section might be interpreted.City of Clovis v. Sw. Pub. Serv. Co., 1945-NMSC-030, 49 N.M. 270, 161 P.2d 878.\n\nInapplicable when contract performed out-of-state.— Where drainage district bonds and coupons issued by Roswell drainage district of New Mexico are made payable to bearer at bank in Illinois, interest rate after maturity of coupons is governed by law of state where contract was to be performed and not by this section.Roswell Drainage Dist. v. Parker, 53 F.2d 793 (10th Cir. 1931).\n\nApplicable when contract uses mathematical formula.— When the amount owed is ascertainable by a mathematical calculation from a standard fixed in the contract or from established market prices, this section is applicable.Grynberg v. Roberts, 1985-NMSC-040, 102 N.M. 560, 698 P.2d 430.\n\nAn injured party is entitled to prejudgment interest as a matter of right when the amount due under the contract can be ascertained with reasonable certainty by a mathematical standard fixed in the contract or by established market prices. The trial court has discretion to award prejudgment interest, if justice requires, when the contract amount is not ascertainable by the above means.Kueffer v. Kueffer, 1990-NMSC-045, 110 N.M. 10, 791 P.2d 461.\n\nPrejudgment interest is permissible as a matter of right when the amount due under the contract can be ascertained with reasonable certainty by a mathematical standard fixed in the contract or by established market prices. Furthermore, so long as the amount of money obligation is ascertainable, interest is recoverable even where the creditor has not actually realized any loss as a result of nonpayment.Martinez v. Albuquerque Collection Servs., Inc., 867 F. Supp. 1495 (D.N.M. 1994).\n\nApplicability in divorce cases.— Award of prejudgment interest in a divorce case is a question within the sound discretion of the trial court, as it is in other cases.Jurado v. Jurado, 1995-NMCA-014, 119 N.M. 522, 892 P.2d 969.\n\nFact that defendant offered to pay contested amount before trialis not persuasive that it was inequitable for the trial court to award plaintiff prejudgment interest on the amount.Aspen Landscaping, Inc. v. Longford Homes of N.M., Inc., 2004-NMCA-063, 135 N.M. 607, 92 P.3d 53, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-005, 135 N.M. 565, 92 P.3d 10.\n\nSubsection A requires that contract be breachedbefore an award of prejudgment interest can be considered.State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Barker, 2004-NMCA-105, 136 N.M. 211, 96 P.3d 336.\n\nPurpose of prejudgment interest.— This section allows prejudgment interest in cases proving money due by contract; the obligation to pay prejudgment interest arises by operation of law and constitutes an obligation to pay damages to compensate a claimant for the lost opportunity to use money owed the claimant and retained by the obligor between the time the claimant's claim accrues and the time of judgement (the loss of use and earning power of the claimant's fund).State ex rel. Bob Davis Masonry, Inc. v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., 1994-NMSC-106, 118 N.M. 558, 883 P.2d 144.\n\nCertainty of damagesdoes not provide the basis for an award of prejudgment interest under this section.State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Barker, 2004-NMCA-105, 136 N.M. 211, 96 P.3d 336.\n\nPrejudgment interest as damages.— The fact that Subsection A fixes a statutory maximum rate of 15 percent for interest \"on money due by contract\" does not preclude use of that rate in computing prejudgment interest as damages; the same rate is fixed in Subsection B for interest \"on money received to the use of another and retained without the owner's consent expressed or implied\". Interest as damages is computed at the statutory rate, and finding an implied contract to pay interest is not necessary in order to apply Subsection B.Economy Rentals, Inc. v. Garcia, 1991-NMSC-092, 112 N.M. 748, 819 P.2d 1306.\n\nConstruction with Section 56-8-4 NMSA 1978.— Prejudgment interest assessed from the date the claim accrued was consistent with an award under this section, not 56-8-4B NMSA 1978; as a result, the appeals court should not review the award as a matter of discretion, but as an award as of right pursuant to this section.Gilmore v. Duderstadt, 1998-NMCA-086, 125 N.M. 330, 961 P.2d 175.\n\nPrejudgment interest not considered insurance \"claim\".— Prejudgment interest is not included within the definition of \"covered claims\" in 59A-43-4C NMSA 1978 so as to be limited or excluded by the Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Law liability cap of $100,000 per occurrence on individual \"covered claims.\" Also, no specific authority within the Guaranty Law is necessary to award prejudgment interest. The trial court has that authority under either this section or 56-8-4B NMSA 1978.Aztec Well Servicing Co. v. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Guar. Ass'n, 1993-NMSC-023, 115 N.M. 475, 853 P.2d 726.\n\nPrejudgment interest rate to be appliedis the one in effect when the dispute becomes a pending case.Taylor v. Allegretto, 1994-NMSC-081, 118 N.M. 85, 879 P.2d 86.\n\nCountervailing equities regarding prejudgment interest.— When prejudgment interest is awarded either as a matter of right or in the trial court's discretion, the court will examine any countervailing equities to determine whether the award was properly made.State ex rel. Bob Davis Masonry, Inc. v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., 1994-NMSC-106, 118 N.M. 558, 883 P.2d 144.\n\nDebtor may elect to pay more than legal interest.— Although the legal rate of interest is 6%, that does not prevent a debtor from paying more if he elects, and a debtor who knows that an account stated contains items of interest on average monthly balances agrees to pay interest on the monthly balances.Brown & Manzanares Co. v. Gise, 1907-NMSC-030, 14 N.M. 282, 91 P. 716.\n\nA mere difference of opinion as to the amount owedwill not relieve the breaching party for liability for prejudgment interest.Kueffer v. Kueffer, 1990-NMSC-045, 110 N.M. 10, 791 P.2d 461.\n\nInterest on judgment against political subdivision.— Because of the separate policies furthered by the two sections, it cannot be said that the language of 56-8-4D NMSA 1978 exempts a city from prejudgment interest under this section, which is silent as to the assessment of interest against political subdivisions.City of Carlsbad v. Grace, 1998-NMCA-144, 126 N.M. 95, 966 P.2d 1178.\n\nLegal interest rate if contract silent.— This section empowers private lenders to charge interest on money debts at the legal rate if the contract is silent on the issue.Martinez v. Albuquerque Collection Servs., Inc., 867 F. Supp. 1495 (D.N.M. 1994).\n\nSource of award not determinative.— In determining interest, whether an award is made by arbitrators or by a court is not the determining factor.State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Barker, 2004-NMCA-105, 136 N.M. 211, 96 P.3d 336.\n\nII. MONEY DUE BY CONTRACT.\n\nA. IN GENERAL.\n\nSince check takes on characteristics of demand note,section covering interest on money due on contract applies.Coseboom v. Marshall Trust, 1960-NMSC-113, 67 N.M. 405, 356 P.2d 117.\n\nCheck on which payment has been stoppedcomes within classification of \"money due by contract.\"Coseboom v. Marshall Trust, 1960-NMSC-113, 67 N.M. 405, 356 P.2d 117.\n\nMoney due on settlement from insurance policy is \"due by contract\"and is therefore subject to interest at the statutory rate.O'Meara v. Commercial Ins. Co., 1962-NMSC-160, 71 N.M. 145, 376 P.2d 486.\n\nMoney due on settlement from insurance policy.— Trial court's application of Subsection A and award of prejudgment interest for money due by contract was proper based on a judgment allowing the stacking of insurance coverage because the insured had a reasonable expectation of coverage under the policy.Ponder v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 2000-NMSC-033, 129 N.M. 698, 12 P.3d 960.\n\nOral contract.— Where plaintiff was the assignee of an account receivable due under an oral contract to care for and feed cattle; and defendant testified that the parties to the oral contract orally agreed to waive interest charges, it was within the discretion of the trial court to disbelieve evidence of the alleged oral waiver and award fifteen percent interest on the amount due.Production Credit Ass'n of Sw. N.M. v. Alamo Ranch Co., 989 F.2d 413 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nB. DATE OF ACCRUAL.\n\nInterest accrues upon maturity of indebtedness.— In a situation where no additional demand is required to mature the indebtedness, reason and logic support the accrual of interest from the date of refusal of payment.Coseboom v. Marshall Trust, 1960-NMSC-113, 67 N.M. 405, 356 P.2d 117.\n\nOn demand notes interest is recoverable from time of demand.Coseboom v. Marshall Trust, 1960-NMSC-113, 67 N.M. 405, 356 P.2d 117.\n\nInterest on bill of exchange dates from judgment.— Principal's liability on a bill of exchange drawn against it by an agent and paid by the plaintiff bank does not include interest on the principal amount before the date judgment was entered.Roswell State Bank v. Lawrence Walker Cotton Co., 1952-NMSC-020, 56 N.M. 107, 240 P.2d 1143.\n\nContract does not expressly forbid accrual of interest.— Where the parties entered into a long-term contract for the sale of natural gas, plaintiff recovered judgment against defendant for overcharges together with prejudgment interest; the contract provided that if plaintiff paid an overcharge, then within 30 days after final determination, defendant would refund the amount of the overcharge; and there was no indication that the parties intended to delay the due date for payment of overcharges until final judicial determination, no prohibition of prejudgment interest on overcharges could be implied from the contract and the award of prejudgment interest was within the discretion of the trial court.City of Farmington v. Amoco Gas Co., 777 F.2d 554 (10th Cir. 1985).\n\nOral contract.— Where the parties entered into an oral contract to care for and feed cattle, prejudgment interest should be awarded on the amount due for cattle feed from the date the last of the cattle were sold, which was the date when the amount due under the oral contract could be ascertained with reasonable certainty.Production Credit Ass'n of Sw. N.M. v. Alamo Ranch Co., 989 F.2d 413 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nIII. MONEY RETAINED WITHOUT CONSENT.\n\nCotenant liable for interest on rents and profits withheld from cotenant.— Where a cotenant entered under a deed which purported to convey the whole estate, and claimed the land adversely, he is liable for interest on his cotenant's share of the rents and profits received, although his cotenant failed to demand them, as there was no consent to their retention.Armijo v. Neher, 1903-NMSC-005, 11 N.M. 645, 72 P. 12.\n\nExpress contract stipulating no interest.— Subsection B does not create a liability for interest if the retention of a payable obligation is proper. When an express provision of a contract stipulates that a payable obligation is to bear no interest, there can be no implied contract to pay interest under the statute.Murdock v. Pure-Lively Energy 1981-A, Ltd., 1989-NMSC-048, 108 N.M. 575, 775 P.2d 1292.\n\nPrejudgment interest may be awarded in connection with judgment based on quantum meruit.— When a person is found to be liable in quantum meruit, the factfinder has made, in essence, a determination that the person has retained the money due (i.e., the value of the services or materials) and has deprived the claimant of the opportunity to use the money. The trial court may compensate the claimant for the lost opportunity by awarding prejudgment interest.Taylor v. Allegretto, 1994-NMSC-081, 118 N.M. 85, 879 P.2d 86.\n\nBeneficiary mistakenly paid money owes prejudgment interest.— When a p.o.d. (paid on death) beneficiary of a joint account was mistakenly paid the money in the account upon the death of one of the two joint tenants and was, thus, unjustly enriched at the bank's expense, the bank was entitled as a matter of right (absent countervailing equities) to an award of prejudgment interest at a rate of not more than 15%.Sunwest Bank v. Colucci, 1994-NMSC-027, 117 N.M. 373, 872 P.2d 346.\n\nAward of prejudgment interest is a question of law.— The award of prejudgment interest is a question of law solely within the sound discretion of the court and where defendant wrongfully deducted the amount due on a delinquent promissory note from a non-renewal certificate of deposit with a fixed term of six months and a fixed rate of six percent, the court did not err in awarding prejudgment interest in the statutory amount on the ground that because there was no contract in force, 56-8-3 NMSA 1978 applied.Navajo Tribe v. Bank of N.M., 700 F.2d 1285 (10th Cir., 1983).\n\nIV. MONEY DUE ON MATURED ACCOUNTS.\n\nInterest collectable after maturity of general obligation bond.— Because of 73-21-18 and 73-21-19 NMSA 1978 allowing a governing body to levy and collect taxes for payment of general obligations at any time they should become necessary, as opposed to special obligation bonds which can draw only upon specific funds as designated by statute and city ordinance, interest may be collected after the date of maturity of a general obligation bond in accordance with the general rule that interest coupons or notes executed by the maker of a note or bond to evidence installments of interest do bear interest after maturity, although there is no provision for interest.Dexter v. Lakeshore City Sanitation Dist., 1971-NMSC-057, 82 N.M. 556, 484 P.2d 1266.\n\nSection inapplicable to special revenue bonds.— This section is inapplicable when a specific rule applies to the state or its subdivisions, particularly in the case of special revenue bonds. The statutory method of repaying such bonds is exclusive. Thus, bondholders do not receive interest upon interest after maturity of passing bonds.Munro v. City of Albuquerque, 1939-NMSC-043, 43 N.M. 334, 93 P.2d 993.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —45 Am.

      "text": "A. Interest shall be allowed on judgments and decrees for the payment of money from entry and shall be calculated at the rate of eight and three-fourths percent per year, unless:\n\n(1) the judgment is rendered on a written instrument having a different rate of interest, in which case interest shall be computed at a rate no higher than specified in the instrument; or\n\n(2) the judgment is based on tortious conduct, bad faith or intentional or willful acts, in which case interest shall be computed at the rate of fifteen percent.\n\nB. Unless the judgment is based on unpaid child support, the court in its discretion may allow interest of up to ten percent from the date the complaint is served upon the defendant after considering, among other things:\n\n(1) if the plaintiff was the cause of unreasonable delay in the adjudication of the plaintiff's claims; and\n\n(2) if the defendant had previously made a reasonable and timely offer of settlement to the plaintiff.\n\nC. Nothing contained in this section shall affect the award of interest or the time from which interest is computed as otherwise permitted by statute or common law.\n\nD. The state and its political subdivisions are exempt from the provisions of this section except as otherwise provided by statute or common law.\n\nHistory:Laws 1851-1852, p. 255; C.L. 1865, ch. 79, § 5; C.L. 1884, § 1735; C.L. 1897, § 2551; Code 1915, § 3526; C.S. 1929, § 89-104; 1941 Comp., § 53-604; 1953 Comp., § 50-6-4; Laws 1977, ch. 293, § 1; 1980, ch. 68, § 2; 1983, ch. 254, § 2; 1993, ch. 112, § 1; 2004, ch. 41, § 7.\n\nThe 2004 amendment,effective May 19, 2004, inserted at the beginning of Subsection B \"Unless the judgment is based on unpaid child support\".\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, in Subsection A, substituted \"eight and three-fourths percent\" for \"fifteen percent\"; and in Subsection A(1), substituted \"no higher than specified\" for \"specified in the instrument\".\n\nCompiler's notes.— Annotations to decisions under former 56-8-3 NMSA 1978 and its predecessors, which contained provisions concerning interest on judgment and decrees, appear in the annotations to decisions under this section.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nDiscretion of court.— An interest award under 56-8-4 NMSA 1978 is not an absolute right, but rather is a matter to be left to the discretion of the trial court.Gonzales v. N.M. Dep't of Health, 2000-NMSC-029, 129 N.M. 586, 11 P.3d 550.\n\nSection 52-1-9.1 NMSA 1978 prevails.— The legislative design demonstrates that the specific provisions of 52-1-9.1(G) NMSA 1978 must prevail over the more general application of 56-8-4(B) NMSA 1978.Pipkin v. Daniel, 2009-NMCA-006, 145 N.M. 398, 199 P.3d 301.\n\nFederal claims filed in state court.— The state and its political subdivisions are not exempt from post-judgment interest because the legislature plainly intended interest to be awarded \"as otherwise provided by statute\", 56-8-4D NMSA 1978, and a federal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1961, provide for post-judgment interest in 42 U.S.C. § 1983 actions. The legislature intended the interest rate set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1961 to apply to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 actions filed in state court.Albuquerque Commons P'ship v. City Council, 2011-NMSC-002, 149 N.M. 308, 248 P.3d 856.\n\nTortious conduct includes negligence and the post-judgment interest rate of 15% applies to judgments awarding damages for negligent conduct.Sandoval v. Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc., 2009-NMCA-095, 146 N.M. 853, 215 P.3d 791.\n\nSection 1983 claim.— Post-judgment interest is not recoverable in a Section 1983 case filed in state court.Albuquerque Commons P'ship v. City Council, 2009-NMCA-065, 146 N.M. 568, 212 P.3d 1122, cert. granted, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 361, 223 P.3d 358,rev'd, 2011-NMSC-002, 149 N.M. 308, 248 P.3d 856.\n\nInsurance companies are not liablefor fifteen percent interest based on the tortious conduct of an uninsured motorist.Bird v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., 2007-NMCA-088, 142 N.M. 346, 165 P.3d 343, cert. denied, 2007-NMCERT-007, 142 N.M. 329, 165 P.3d 326.\n\n1983 amendment applies prospectively.North v. Public Serv. Co., 1983-NMCA-124, 101 N.M. 222, 680 P.2d 603, cert. quashed, 101 N.M. 11, 677 P.2d 624 (1984).\n\nSix percent interest rate in pre-1980, noncontract cases.— The amount of interest that may be awarded on judgments in cases filed prior to the 1980 amendment of former 56-8-3 NMSA 1978 is six percent per annum.Navajo Tribe v. Bank of N.M., 700 F.2d 1285 (10th Cir. 1983).\n\nSubsection A relates to postjudgment interest,not prejudgment interest.State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Barker, 2004-NMCA-105, 136 N.M. 211, 96 P.3d 336.\n\nPostjudgment interest mandatory.— Following the 1983 amendment to this section, postjudgment interest on an award of punitive damages is mandatory.Weststar Mortg. Corp. v. Jackson, 2002-NMCA-009, 131 N.M. 493, 39 P.3d 710,rev'd on other grounds, 2003-NMSC-002, 133 N.M. 114, 61 P.3d 823.\n\nPost-judgment interest on reconsideration of punitive damage award should run from the date of the new judgment.— Where plaintiffs brought claims against defendants for breach of a mortgage contract, wrongful foreclosure, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, violations of the Unfair Practices Act, violations of the Home Loan Protection Act (HLPA), and for attorney fees and punitive damages, in connection with a mortgage accidental death insurance policy and defendants' related misapplication of payments and foreclosure on the insured mortgage, and where, following a bench trial, the district court found in favor of plaintiffs on all claims except the HLPA claim, and awarded actual damages and costs as well as punitive damages, and where the New Mexico court of appeals found that the procedures used to reach the punitive damages award were lacking, set aside the punitive damages award and remanded to the district court for reconsideration of its award, and where, on remand, the district court awarded plaintiffs $2,500,000 in punitive damages and post-judgment interest of 15% to run from the date of the original judgment, the court of appeals held that post-judgment interest should not accrue from the date of the original judgment, but as a matter of law, should run from the date of the second judgment. If an appellate determination only requires modification of a former judgment, interest accrues at the date of the original judgment, but if a remand requires new findings and new computation of an award, then interest accrues from the date of the new judgment.Dollens v. Wells Fargo Bank, 2021-NMCA-039.\n\nRate of post-judgment interest.— Where the open account credit agreement between the supplier of materials and a subcontractor on a municipal construction project provided for interest at 18% per year, post-judgment interest was awardable as a sum justly due under 13-4-19 NMSA 1978 at the rate of 18% per year against the surety on the payment bond for the project.State ex rel. Solsbury Hill, LLC v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 2012-NMCA-032, 273 P.3d 1, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-003.\n\nAward was not based on culpable conduct.— Where plaintiff, who purchased a commercial greenhouse operation to hydrophonically grow tomatoes, contracted with defendant for electrical power; the greenhouse was destroyed in a fire; before the fire and without notifying plaintiff, defendant disconnected electrical power to the greenhouse for nonpayment of bills which prevented plaintiff from pumping water from its wells to quench the fire; plaintiff sued defendant for breach of contract; the district court found that defendant did not act maliciously, willfully, wantonly, fraudulently or in bad faith toward plaintiff prior to the fire; and the district court did not find any pre-fire breach of contract that caused plaintiff damages other than the failure to provide advance notice of the disconnect of electrical power; and the district court did not find that defendant's alleged threat that the fire chief would be liable if defendant reconnected electrical power during the fire was a breach of any particular contract provision or that if the conduct was a breach of contract that the conduct caused any damages to defendant, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff's request for a fifteen percent interest award.Sunnyland Farms, Inc. v. Central N.M. Elec. Coop., Inc., 2011-NMCA-049, 149 N.M. 746, 255 P.3d 324, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 667, 265 P.3d 718.\n\nAction against state.— Plaintiff in wrongful death action was not entitled to postjudgment interest on a prior judgment obtained against the New Mexico State Highway Department (State).Fought v. State, 1988-NMCA-088, 107 N.M. 715, 764 P.2d 142,overruled in part on other grounds byFolz v. State, 1993-NMCA-066, 115 N.M. 639, 857 P.2d 39, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 602, 856 P.2d 250.\n\nPlaintiff was not entitled to postjudgment interest following an award of damages for wrongful termination against a school district.Franco v. Carlsbad Mun. Schs., 2001-NMCA-042, 130 N.M. 543, 28 P.3d 531.\n\nApplicability.— Subsection B of this section applies to all actions and is not limited to certain or specific actions, such as those based on contract or in which damages are ascertainable before trial.Southard v. Fox, 1992-NMCA-045, 113 N.M. 774, 833 P.2d 251.\n\nApplicability to workers' compensation awards.— Where worker was awarded damages under the Workers' Compensation Act because the employer intentionally retaliated against worker for filing a workers' compensation claim, the actions of the employer constituted bad faith, and the employer's actions amounted to fraud, malice, oppression or willful, wanton or reckless disregard of the rights of the worker, the employer was required to award the worker post-judgment interest at the highest rate of fifteen percent.Martinez v. Pojoaque Gaming, Inc., 2011-NMCA-103, 150 N.M. 629, 264 P.3d 725, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 903.\n\nDate interest accrues on worker's compensation awards.— Post judgment interest begins to accrue on the date that an order is filed awarding a partial lump-sum payment.Massengill v. Fisher Sand & Gravel Co., 2013-NMCA-103, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-010.\n\nWhere worker had reached maximum medical improvement and was receiving permanent partial disability, but a final determination of worker's permanent partial disability benefits had not been made; the worker's compensation judge entered an order granting worker a partial lump-sum payment and mailed the order to the parties; and employer claimed that pursuant to 52-5-7(C) NMSA 1978, the order was not operative until thirty days after it was mailed to the parties and that because worker's permanent partial disability benefits had not been determined, the order awarding a partial lump-sum payment was not a final order, post-judgment interest on the compensation award began to run on the date the order was filed, 52-5-7(C) NMSA 1978 does not provide a thirty day grace period to pay a compensation award, and the pending decision on the worker's unresolved permanent partial disability benefits did not render the partial lump-sum award a non-final decision.Massengill v. Fisher Sand & Gravel Co., 2013-NMCA-103, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-010.\n\nThere is a legislative intent to apply this section to final compensation orders in workers' compensation cases.Sanchez v. Siemens Transmission Sys., 1991-NMCA-028, 112 N.M. 236, 814 P.2d 104,rev'd on other grounds, 1991-NMSC-093, 112 N.M. 533, 817 P.2d 726.\n\nPostjudgment interest under subsequent injury act.— The court in its discretion may allow postjudgment interest on compensation benefits payable by the subsequent injury fund and awarded to an injured or disabled workman. Allowance of interest, however, is limited to that portion of a judgment against the fund in favor of an injured worker, and the fund is not liable for the payment of interest on that portion of reimbursement payable by the fund to an employer or its carrier. Additionally, any award of postjudgment interest does not commence to run upon compensation benefits until the time fixed for their payment.Mares v. Valencia Cnty. Sheriff's Dep't, 1988-NMCA-003, 106 N.M. 744, 749 P.2d 1123.\n\nInterest is element of damages to be considered by trial court.— As such, it is left to the discretion of the trial court.Kennedy v. Moutray, 1977-NMSC-109, 91 N.M. 205, 572 P.2d 933;Trujillo v. Beaty Elec. Co., 1978-NMCA-021, 91 N.M. 533, 577 P.2d 431,seeWeststar Mortgage Corp. v. Jackson, 2002-NMCA-009, 131 N.M. 493, 39 P.3d 710,rev'd on other grounds, 2003-NMSC-002, 133 N.M. 114, 61 P.3d 823 (concerning the distinction between pre and postjudgment interest after the 1983 amendment to this section).\n\nInterest generally not allowed on a judgment awarding costs.— The general rule regarding interest on costs is that in the absence of statutory authorization, interest may not be allowed on a judgment awarding costs.Aquifer Science, LLC v. Verhines, 2023-NMCA-020, cert. denied.\n\nThis section authorizes post-judgment interest on an award of costs.— Where applicant, a limited liability company formed to obtain water for the Campbell ranch master plan project, a multiple use development consisting of four villages with residential, commercial, and resort elements spread among Bernalillo county, Sandoval county, and Santa Fe county, sought a permit to appropriate groundwater from the Sandia underground water basin, and where the district court denied plaintiff's application because the magnitude of likely impairment to existing water rights was significant and the application was contrary to conservation of water, and where the district court granted the costs requested by the prevailing party opposing the application for groundwater, and where applicant argued that an award of costs is neither a judgment nor a decree, and, as such, the prevailing party was not entitled to post-judgment interest on their award of costs, the district judge did not err in awarding interest on costs in this case, because an award of costs is a judgment for the payment of money as authorized by 56-8-4(A) NMSA 1978.Aquifer Science, LLC v. Verhines, 2023-NMCA-020, cert. denied.\n\nTrial judge has discretion to allow or withhold interest under this section.Moorhead v. Stearns-Roger Mfg. Co., 320 F.2d 26 (10th Cir. 1963).\n\nDetermination of intention or willfulness.— If a plaintiff wants to insure that a judgment is assessed the higher 15 percent interest rate in a case not based in tort or bad faith, the plaintiff must specifically request that the factfinder make a finding of intention or willfulness; however, if such a finding is not made, and the evidence indicates that the defendant acted with a culpable mental state approximating intention or willfulness, the award of the higher interest rate will be left to the sound discretion of the trial court.Public Serv. Co. v. Diamond D Constr. Co., 2001-NMCA-082, 131 N.M. 100, 33 P.3d 651.\n\nRate at time of filing is determinative.— The statutory rate of interest in effect at the time a breach of contract suit is filed, not that in effect at the time the contract is executed, is applicable to determine prejudgment and postjudgment interest.City of Farmington v. Amoco Gas Co., 777 F.2d 554 (10th Cir. 1985).\n\nA change in interest affects the rights or remedies of the parties, even if these rights or remedies are purely statutory, and therefore the statutory rate of interest in effect when a claim became a pending case is applicable to that case even if the rate of interest is changed prior to judgment.Hillelson v. Republic Ins. Co., 1981-NMSC-048, 96 N.M. 36, 627 P.2d 878;Archuleta v. Jacquez, 1985-NMCA-077, 103 N.M. 254, 704 P.2d 1130.\n\nPostjudgment interest at the rate of 15% was inappropriate where at the time of the filing of the lawsuit the applicable interest rate was 10%.Lopez v. Smith's Mgt. Corp., 1986-NMCA-054, 106 N.M. 416, 744 P.2d 544), cert. quashed, 106 N.M. 405, 744 P.2d 180 (1987).\n\nInterest recoverable from time of actual taking.— United States instituted condemnation proceedings to appropriate for reclamation purposes land already actually taken. In making awards, interest was properly included at 6% from time of actual taking to time of deposit of awards in court in payment of same.United States v. Rogers, 255 U.S. 163, 41 S. Ct. 281, 65 L. Ed. 566 (1921).\n\nInterest as element of damage considered upon breach.— The date on which the contract of insurance is breached - the date when insurance company denies liability - is the date when interest, as an element of damage, might be considered.O'Meara v. Commercial Ins. Co., 1962-NMSC-160, 71 N.M. 145, 376 P.2d 486.\n\nAllowance from breach not matter of right.— The allowance of interest as an element of the total damage is a matter of discretion in the trier of the facts, and not a matter of right under the statute.O'Meara v. Commercial Ins. Co., 1962-NMSC-160, 71 N.M. 145, 376 P.2d 486.\n\nNo prejudgment interest without request.— In a suit in quantum meruit for services rendered by a litigant who does not include a request for interest in the complaint, the court cannot add interest from the date of complete rendition of services to the date of entry of the judgment.United States Potash Co. v. McNutt, 70 F.2d 1003 (10th Cir. 1934).\n\nInterest must be claimed in lower court.— An appellate court will not grant interest unless the subject of interest has been under consideration in the court below.United States Potash Co. v. McNutt, 70 F.2d 1003 (10th Cir. 1934).\n\nInterest awarded not to exceed legal rate.— Where interest is awarded as damages at law, it cannot be granted in excess of the legal rate.Shaeffer v. Kelton, 1980-NMSC-117, 95 N.M. 182, 619 P.2d 1226.\n\nDefendants not entitled to fifteen percent rate of postjudgment interest.— Where plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that when defendants signed a petition and actively supported plaintiff's recall from the Taos school board, such acts constituted malicious abuse of process, civil conspiracy, and prima facie tort, and where defendants filed special motions to dismiss pursuant to § 38-2-9.1 NMSA 1978, alleging that plaintiff's complaint infringed on defendants' first amendment rights, and where the district court granted defendants' special motions to dismiss, granted defendants' request for attorney fees, and awarded postjudgment interest at a rate of 8.75 percent, finding that defendants' support of plaintiff's recall from the Taos school board invoked the substantive protection of the first amendment and the procedural and remedial provisions of the anti-SLAPP statute, the district court did not err in denying defendants' request for postjudgment interest at the rate of fifteen percent because defendants failed to demonstrate that the filing of plaintiff's complaint constituted conduct that was tortious, intentional, or in bad faith as required by § 56-8-4(A)(2) NMSA 1978.Cordova v. Cline, 2021-NMCA-022.\n\nApportionment of postjudgment interest.— In awarding postjudgment interest, the portion of the judgment that awarded damages for bad faith should bear interest at the rate of 15%, however, that portion of damages awarded as measured by standard contract law should bear interest at eight and three quarters percent.Teague-Strebeck Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Ins. Co., 1999-NMCA-109, 127 N.M. 603, 985 P.2d 1183, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 391, 981 P.2d 1209,overruled in part on other grounds bySloan v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 360 F.3d 1220 (10th Cir. N.M. 2004).\n\nError to award variable rate of interest.— When a p.o.d. (paid on death) beneficiary of a joint account was mistakenly paid the money in the account upon the death of one of the two joint tenants and was, thus, unjustly enriched at the bank's expense, the court erred by awarding the bank postjudgment interest calculated at a variable rate equal to the rate paid by the bank to the federal reserve bank for funds borrowed. Postjudgment interest on judgments and decrees for payment of money is mandatory and accrues at the statutory rate from the date of entry of judgment, unless the judgment is based on a written instrument bearing a different rate. The judgment in this case was not rendered on a written contract, and therefore postjudgment interest should have been calculated at the statutory rate of fifteen percent in effect at the time the complaint was filed.Sunwest Bank v. Colucci, 1994-NMSC-027, 117 N.M. 373, 872 P.2d 346 (decided prior to 1993 amendment).\n\nAllowance of excess interest reversible error.— It is error to allow a greater rate than that legally allowed, for which a reversal will be granted unless defendant remits the excess of interest.Romero v. Desmarais, 1889-NMSC-011, 5 N.M. 142, 20 P. 787.\n\nAffirmance conditioned on remission of excess allowable.— Where judgment, otherwise correct, has awarded 10% interest, it will be affirmed on condition of the remission of the excess interest.Romero v. Desmarais, 1889-NMSC-011, 5 N.M. 142, 20 P. 787;Hopkins v. Orr, 124 U.S. 510, 8 S. Ct. 590, 31 L. Ed. 523 (1888).\n\nAllowance of excess modifiable.— In view of this section, the court is not authorized to allow 8% interest on the award of a commission sued for, and such allowance will be modified by the supreme court.Taylor v. Sarracino, 1940-NMSC-053, 44 N.M. 469, 104 P.2d 742.\n\nUpon remand on damages, interest accrues from new judgment.— Where reviewing court's opinion only requires a modification of the former judgment (such as remittitur or additur), interest accrues at the date of the original judgment; but if that court has reversed the former judgment, insofar as damages are concerned, and remanded for new findings and computation of the award, such as here, then interest accrues from the date of the new judgment.Varney v. Taylor, 1969-NMSC-175, 81 N.M. 87, 463 P.2d 511.\n\nAbsent abuse district court award stands.— The district court exercises discretion in awarding prejudgment interest, and absent abuse, the court's decision should be allowed to stand. For a finding of abuse of discretion, an appellant bears the burden of proving the district court's decision is contrary to all logic and reason.Delisle v. Avallone, 1994-NMCA-012, 117 N.M. 602, 874 P.2d 1266, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 773, 877 P.2d 579.\n\nInterest on child support arrearages award.— Because each unpaid installment was a final judgment, mother's claim was to post-judgment, not pre-judgment, interest, and payment is mandatory.Bustos v. Bustos, 2000-NMCA-040, 128 N.M. 842, 999 P.2d 1074.\n\nWorkers' compensation cases.— There is nothing which indicates that Subsection A should not apply in workers' compensation cases.Candelaria v. General Elec. Co., 1986-NMCA-016, 105 N.M. 167, 730 P.2d 470, cert. quashed, 105 N.M. 111, 729 P.2d 1365.\n\nInterest against state.— Subsection D does not bar appellants from recovering interest against the state under the circumstances of this case because the present causes of action were pending prior to the effective date of Subsection D in 1983.Folz v. State, 1993-NMCA-066, 115 N.M. 639, 857 P.2d 39, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 602, 856 P.2d 250.\n\nSection 41-4-19 NMSA 1978, when read in pari materia with Subsection D of this section, prohibits the awarding of post-judgment interest on tort judgments against the state and its subdivisions.Trujillo v. City of Albuquerque, 1998-NMSC-031, 125 N.M. 721, 965 P.2d 305.\n\nLegislature waived immunity for post-judgment interest in the Whistleblower Protection Act.— Where plaintiff sued defendant Northern New Mexico College (NNMC) pursuant to the New Mexico Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), NMSA 1978, §§ 10-16C-1 to -6, and where plaintiff offered evidence at trial that NNMC removed her from her position as director of NNMC's campus in El Rito, New Mexico, transferred her to another position, and then terminated her employment in retaliation for her communications to NNMC's administrators about NNMC's failure to approve expenditures necessary for the successful implementation of a plan to revitalize the El Rito campus, and where the jury concluded that NNMC violated the WPA and found by special verdict form that plaintiff had communicated to defendant about the occurrence of an improper act, that there was a reasonable basis in fact for the improper act, and that defendant retaliated against plaintiff because of a communication about that improper act, and where the jury awarded plaintiff $239,000 in backpay and $180,000 to compensate her for emotional distress, the trial court erred in denying plaintiff's motion for post-judgment interest, because by explicitly making public employers liable for interest on back pay in NMSA 1978, § 10-16C-4, the legislature waived sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest pursuant to Subsection D of this section.Velasquez v. Regents of Northern N.M. Coll., 2021-NMCA-007, cert. denied.\n\nII. PREJUDGMENT INTEREST.\n\nConstruction with Section 56-8-3 NMSA 1978.— Prejudgment interest assessed from the date the claim accrued was consistent with an award under 56-8-3 NMSA 1978, not this section; as a result, the appeals court should not review the award as a matter of discretion, but as an award as of right pursuant to 56-8-3 NMSA 1978.Gilmore v. Duderstadt, 1998-NMCA-086, 125 N.M. 330, 961 P.2d 175.\n\nBecause of the separate policies furthered by the two sections, it cannot be said that the language of Subsection D exempts a city from prejudgment interest under 56-8-3 NMSA 1978, which is silent as to the assessment of interest against political subdivisions.City of Carlsbad v. Grace, 1998-NMCA-144, 126 N.M. 95, 966 P.2d 1178.\n\nValid judgment required.— Subsection B of this section presupposes a valid judgment; therefore, a judgment that has been set aside for want of jurisdiction cannot be the basis for an award of prejudgment interest.Martinez v. Friede, 2003-NMCA-081, 133 N.M. 834, 70 P.3d 1273,rev'd on other grounds, 2004-NMSC-006, 135 N.M. 171, 86 P.3d 596.\n\nPurpose of prejudgment interest.— Prejudgment interest serves two purposes, promoting early settlements and compensating persons. Interest is awarded to make the tort victim whole, and has no bearing on the question of punishing the tortfeasor.Morga v. FedEx Ground Package Sys.,2018-NMCA-039, aff'd on other grounds by2022-NMSC-013.\n\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest.- In a wrongful death, personal injury, and loss of consortium case, where plaintiff's claims arose from a catastrophic automobile accident which caused the death of his wife and daughter and seriously injured his son, and where the jury returned a verdict for more than $165 million in compensatory damages, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest where the district court concluded that defendants' sole settlement offer was unreasonable and that defendants lacked an appreciation or concern about the potential results of a trial.Morga v. FedEx Ground Package Sys.,2018-NMCA-039,aff'd on other grounds by2022-NMSC-013.\n\nDamages need not be fixed or ascertainable.— Subsection B is not limited by whether damages are fixed or ascertainable. Because the language in Subsection B is general, the legislature must have intended that, to foster timely settlements, a discretionary award of prejudgment interest is allowed in all cases.Lucero v. Aladdin Beauty Colls., Inc., 1994-NMSC-022, 117 N.M. 269, 871 P.2d 365.\n\nHigher interest rate allowable when debtor notified by written instrument.— Allowance of 18% on a judgment until the debt is paid is proper only where there is \"a written instrument,\" of which the debtor possesses a copy, having a different rate of interest than the 15% permitted by this section.N.M. Tire & Battery Co. v. Ole Tires, Inc., 1984-NMSC-063, 101 N.M. 357, 683 P.2d 39.\n\nHigher rate by agreement of parties.— Where the open account credit agreement between the supplier of materials and a subcontractor on a municipal construction project provided for interest at 18% per year, prejudgment interest was awardable as a sum justly due under 13-4-19 NMSA 1978 at the rate of 18% per year against the surety on the payment bond for the project.State ex rel. Solsbury Hill, LLC v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 2012-NMCA-032, 273 P.3d 1, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-003.\n\nAward of prejudgment interest within court's discretion.— The award of prejudgment interest is a question of law solely within the sound discretion of the court.Navajo Tribe v. Bank of N.M., 700 F.2d 1285 (10th Cir. 1983).\n\nThis section provides authority for an award of prejudgment interest at the discretion of the trial court.State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Barker, 2004-NMCA-105, 136 N.M. 211, 96 P.3d 336.\n\nThe trial court has discretion as to prejudgment interest under this section;thus, where the district court necessarily exercised such discretion in making its award, the appellate court would not disturb the award absent a showing of abuse of discretion.Kennedy v. Dexter Consol. Schs., 1998-NMCA-051, 124 N.M. 764, 955 P.2d 693,rev'd on other grounds, 2000-NMSC-025, 129 N.M. 436, 10 P.3d 115.\n\nPrejudgment interest awarded under 56-8-4 B NMSA 1978 is not damages that must be determined by the jury and the legislature could properly entrust such determinations to the trial court.Southard v. Fox, 1992-NMCA-045, 113 N.M. 774, 833 P.2d 251.\n\nReview of award.— An award of prejudgment interest is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co., 2004-NMCA-101, 136 N.M. 259, 96 P.3d 1179.\n\nDenial of prejudgment interest was not an abuse of discretion.— Where a fire destroyed plaintiff's hydroponic tomato facility; the day before the fire, defendant shut off electricity to the facility for nonpayment; defendant failed to give plaintiff the customary fifteen-day notice to pay the overdue bill before defendant suspended service; plaintiff's pumps were powered by electricity and without power, firefighters could not access well water to suppress the fire; plaintiff recovered contract and tort damages against defendant; the district court refused to award prejudgment interest; and the case involved difficult, complex legal issues concerning causation, comparative fault and estimation of lost profits; and the parties had genuine differences of opinion on the strength of plaintiff's case and failed to settle, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying prejudgment interest.Sunnyland Farms, Inc. v. Central N.M. Elec. Coop., Inc., 2013-NMSC-017, 301 P.3d 387,aff'g2011-NMCA-049, 149 N.M. 746, 255 P.3d 324.\n\nFindings for denial of interest not required.— When an award of prejudgment interest is in the trial court's discretion and not a matter of right under 56-8-3 NMSA 1978, the court does not need to make specific factual findings; the reasons for denying interest need only be ascertainable from the record and not contrary to logic; in addition, the two factors listed in this section are not exclusive and the court should take into account all relevant equitable considerations.Gonzales v. Surgidev Corp., 1995-NMSC-036, 120 N.M. 133, 899 P.2d 576.\n\nNo interest for seller causing contract's nonperformance.— A seller is not entitled to interest on the unpaid portion of the purchase price when the seller causes nonperformance of a contract.Smith v. McKee, 1993-NMSC-046, 116 N.M. 34, 859 P.2d 1061.\n\nInterest on interest not authorized.— Absent either a contract or statutory provision authorizing interest on interest prior to judgment, such may not be recovered.Southern Union Exploration Co. v. Wynn Exploration Co., 1981-NMCA-006, 95 N.M. 594, 624 P.2d 536, cert. denied, 95 N.M. 593, 624 P.2d 535, and cert. denied, 455 U.S. 920, 102 S. Ct. 1276, 71 L. Ed. 2d 461 (1982).\n\nMonthly compounding incorrect.— The trial court incorrectly computed a prejudgment interest award from a calculation incorporating monthly compounding. The result was an award of interest in excess of the statutory rate.Consolidated Oil & Gas, Inc. v. Southern Union Co., 1987-NMSC-055, 106 N.M. 719, 749 P.2d 1098, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1063, 108 S. Ct. 1021, 98 L. Ed. 2d 986 (1988).\n\nPrejudgment interest rate set when action becomes pending.— The rate of prejudgment interest to be granted is that rate in effect when an action becomes pending.Grynberg v. Roberts, 1985-NMSC-040, 102 N.M. 560, 698 P.2d 430.\n\nWhen contract silent on interest, prejudgment interest allowable.— Where a contract does not specifically preclude interest, an award of prejudgment interest under this section is within the sound discretion of the trial court.City of Farmington v. Amoco Gas Co., 777 F.2d 554 (10th Cir. 1985).\n\nNot legally required in negligent misrepresentation action.— The court was not required as a matter of law to award prejudgment interest in an action for negligent misrepresentation, even though the damages were allegedly readily ascertainable. Prejudgment interest should be awarded as a matter of right only when the defendant has breached a contract to pay a definite sum of money.Charter Servs., Inc. v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 1994-NMCA-007, 117 N.M. 82, 868 P.2d 1307.\n\nPrejudgment interest upheld where discretion not abused.— Since it is within the discretion of a court to award prejudgment interest when the amount of damages in question is ascertainable, if no abuse of that discretion is shown, an award of prejudgment interest will be upheld.United Nuclear Corp. v. Allendale Mut. Ins. Co., 1985-NMSC-090, 103 N.M. 480, 709 P.2d 649.\n\nDenial of prejudgment interest.— Where a fire, that was negligently caused by defendant, destroyed plaintiff's household goods and personal effects in a mobile home that plaintiff rented from defendant; both sides aggressively litigated the case and engaged in extensive motions practice; defendant did not offer to settle until nine months after plaintiff filed suit; defendant contested liability for two and one half years before changing its position and stipulating to liability; and defendant made a number of offers, each of which met or exceeded the jury award, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff's request for pre-judgment interest.Behrens v. Gateway Court, L.L.C., 2013-NMCA-097, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-009.\n\nWhere worker was awarded damages for bad faith and wrongful termination under the Workers' Compensation Act and the employer did not cause any unreasonable delay in the workers' compensation proceedings or make any unreasonable settlement offers prior to trial, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the worker's request for prejudgment interest.Martinez v. Pojoaque Gaming, Inc., 2011-NMCA-103, 150 N.M. 629, 264 P.3d 725, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-009, 269 P.3d 903.\n\nSince the plaintiffs did not request prejudgment interest until after entry of the final judgment, and, in addition, the defendant was not responsible for a delay between the jury verdict and entry of judgment and had made settlement offers which were not unreasonable as a matter of law, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiffs' motion for prejudgment interest.Gonzales v. Surgidev Corp., 1995-NMSC-036, 120 N.M. 133, 899 P.2d 576.\n\nWhen initiation of action delayed, no interest.— The court's decision denying the plaintiff's prejudgment interest did not constitute an abuse of discretion, given the \"great lapse of time\" since the initiation of the action.Charter Servs., Inc. v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 1994-NMCA-007, 117 N.M. 82, 868 P.2d 1307.\n\nPrejudgment interest not considered insurance \"claim\".— Prejudgment interest is not included within the definition of \"covered claims\" in 59A-43-4C NMSA 1978 so as to be limited or excluded by the Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Law liability cap of $100,000 per occurrence on individual \"covered claims.\" Also, no specific authority within the Guaranty Law is necessary to award prejudgment interest. The trial court has that authority under either 56-8-3 or 56-8-4B NMSA 1978.Aztec Well Servicing Co. v. Property & Cas. Ins. Guar. Ass'n, 1993-NMSC-023, 115 N.M. 475, 853 P.2d 726.\n\nAward of prejudgment interest was inappropriate in workmen's (workers') compensationcase where, at the time the complaint was filed, neither this section nor the Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Act, Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978, allowed for such an award.Lopez v. Smith's Mgmt. Corp., 1986-NMCA-054, 106 N.M. 416, 744 P.2d 544, cert. quashed, 106 N.M. 405, 744 P.2d 180 (1987).\n\nInterest appropriate where proceedings delayed.— Trial court was within its discretion to assess prejudgment interest against husband, where he rejected wife's offers of settlement, and delayed proceedings on the grounds that he was going to call numerous witnesses whom he did not call.Trego v. Scott, 1998-NMCA-080, 125 N.M. 323, 961 P.2d 168, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 322, 961 P.2d 167 (1998).\n\nDefendant entitled to prejudgment interest.— In a negligence action, where it was determined that defendant had not been the source of unreasonable delay and there were difficult legal issues to be decided which would probably preclude settlement and which were worthy of full briefing and argument, it was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to award prejudgment interest.Abeita v. Northern Rio Arriba Elec. Coop., 1997-NMCA-097, 124 N.M. 97, 946 P.2d 1108.\n\nExemption for state in workers' compensation action.— Subsection D contains an express exemption for the state from awards of prejudgment interest in favor of an injured worker in a workers' compensation action.Montney v. State ex rel. State Hwy. Dep't, 1989-NMCA-002, 108 N.M. 326, 772 P.2d 360, cert. denied, 108 N.M. 197, 769 P.2d 731.\n\nAward allowed under Occupational Disease Disability Law.— Subsection B does not apply to decisions made pursuant to the Occupational Disease Disability Law. However, such interest is allowed under Workers' Compensation Division Rules, WCD 89-4(V)(A)(3) (now 11.4.4.13D(3)), promulgated under 52-5-4A NMSA 1978 (authority of director to adopt rules and regulations).Bryant v. Lear Siegler Mgmt. Servs. Corp., 1993-NMCA-052, 115 N.M. 502, 853 P.2d 753.\n\nNonpecuniary losses.— This section permits the trial court to award prejudgment interest on judgments for tort actions, including those amounts for nonpecuniary and unliquidated losses.Southard v. Fox, 1992-NMCA-045, 113 N.M. 774, 833 P.2d 251.\n\nPunitive damage award was not subject to prejudgment interest.Weidler v. Big J Enters., Inc., 1998-NMCA-021, 124 N.M. 591, 953 P.2d 1089.\n\nAm.

      "text": "A. Unless otherwise provided by law, no person, corporation or association, directly or indirectly, shall take, reserve, receive or charge any interest, discount or other advantage for the loan of money or credit or the forbearance or postponement of the right to receive money or credit except at the rates permitted in Sections 56-8-1 through 56-8-21 NMSA 1978.\n\nB. No provision of law prescribing maximum rates of interest that may be charged in any transaction shall apply to a transaction in which a corporation, limited liability corporation or other business entity is a debtor, regardless of the purpose for which the corporation was formed and regardless of the fact that an individual is codebtor, endorser, guarantor, surety or accommodation party. No corporation or its codebtor, endorser, guarantor, surety or accommodation party shall have a cause of action or affirmatively plead, counterclaim, set off or set up the defense of usury in any action to recover damages or enforce a remedy on any obligation executed by the corporation, and no civil or criminal penalty that would otherwise be applicable except as provided in Sections 30-43-1 through 30-43-5 NMSA 1978 shall apply on any obligation executed by the corporation.\n\nC. A lender may, in the case of business or commercial loans for business or commercial purposes in the amount of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) or more, take, receive, reserve or charge on any loan or discount made, or upon any note, bill of exchange or other evidence of debt, interest at a rate agreed to by the parties.\n\nD. In addition to the maximum interest or discount that a lender is permitted to charge by law, the lender may charge, take, reserve or receive a premium or points in an amount up to but not exceeding three percent of the face amount of the loan on interim construction loans. The lender may charge and require the borrower to pay the premium upon execution of the loan agreement, whether the proceeds are delivered to the borrower immediately or whether there are to be obligatory or permissive future advances. The lender shall not be required to refund this charge in the event of prepayment of the obligation. For the purposes of this section, \"interim construction loan\" means a loan secured by a first mortgage and used by the borrower primarily for financing the construction of buildings, structures or improvements on or to the real property on which the first mortgage has been taken.\n\nE. A lender may charge, take, reserve or receive points or a premium on any loan secured by real property; provided the points or premium together with the interest or discount charged, taken, reserved or received do not exceed the maximum interest or discount permitted by law. The lender shall not be required to refund this charge in the event of prepayment even if the prepayment would result in a higher charge to the borrower than permitted by law.\n\nF. A loan in an amount equal to five thousand dollars ($5,000) or less shall be made only pursuant to the New Mexico Bank Installment Loan Act of 1959 [58-7-1 to 58-7-3, 58-7-5 to 58-7-9 NMSA 1978] or the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 [Chapter 58, Article 15 NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 50-6-15, enacted by Laws 1957, ch. 209, § 1; 1977, ch. 293, § 4; 1980, ch. 39, § 6; 2017, ch. 110, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For rates and charges on bank installment loans,see58-7-1 to 58-7-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2017 amendment,effective January 1, 2018, provided that no provision of law prescribing maximum rates of interest that may be charged in any transaction shall apply to transactions in which a limited liability corporation or other business entity is a debtor, removed a reference to a repealed provision of law, and provided that loans in the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000) or less shall be made only pursuant to the New Mexico Bank Installment Loan Act of 1959 or the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955; in Subsection B, after \"corporation\", added \"limited liability corporation or other business entity\"; in Subsection C, after \"agreed to by the parties\", deleted \"even if the rate exceeds the rate set forth in Section 56-8-11 NMSA 1978\"; and added Subsection F.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2017, ch. 110, § 26 provided that the provisions of Laws 2017, ch. 110 shall apply to loans subject to the New Mexico Small Loan Act of 1955 and the New Mexico Bank Installment Loan Act of 1959 executed on or after January 1, 2018.\n\nWhat constitutes forbearance.— All the terms of Subsection A denote consensual agreements between the parties, indicating that a withholding or detention by the borrower not consented to by the lender is not within the article's purview. The mere fact that the parties have agreed to the rate to be paid after the debt is due does not make an arrangement a forbearance.Smith Mach. Co. v. Jenkins, 654 F.2d 693 (10th Cir. 1981).\n\nApplicability of prohibition in Subsection B.— Subsection B, prohibiting a corporation from bringing a usury action, has no applicability to an action involving a violation of 56-8-7 NMSA 1978, limiting commission rates on procuring loans.Diane, Inc. v. Kapnison, 1983-NMSC-056, 100 N.M. 143, 667 P.2d 450.\n\nObligations assumed in addition to maximum interest not usurious.— Transaction requiring borrower to assume additional obligations of third party in order to get an extension on his loan is not usurious where there is a close business relationship between borrower and third party, and reason for the borrower to assume the obligations, as well as an absence of intent to exact a usurious return.McCullough v. Snow, 1967-NMSC-247, 78 N.M. 455, 432 P.2d 811.\n\nParty asserting usury has burden of proof absent indication thereof on face.— When the notes sued upon show no indication of usury on their face, the burden of proving usury is on the party asserting it.McCullough v. Snow, 1967-NMSC-247, 78 N.M. 455, 432 P.2d 811.\n\nApplies to insurance premium financing arrangements.— There is a limitation on the finance charge which is imposed for financing insurance premiums when the insurance is not written in connection with loans or financing. The premiums financing arrangement is a loan, as such it is subject to usury laws. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-52.\n\nLender may charge up to three points for interim construction.— A lender, making a home loan for purposes of interim construction financing under the Residential Home Loan Act (56-8-22 to 56-8-30 NMSA 1978), may charge \"points\" not to exceed three percent of the face amount of the loan in addition to any amounts allowed as interest under 56-8-25 and 56-8-26 NMSA 1978 (since repealed). 1980 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 80-14 (rendered under prior law).\n\nService charge in addition to legal interest allowed.— A person or corporation may charge a reasonable service charge for servicing a loan of money under this section in addition to the specified interest rates contained in former 56-8-11 NMSA 1978 as long as such is a bona fide cost incident to processing such loans and is not a subterfuge to exact a higher interest rate than permitted by law. 1965 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-09.\n\nThe vast weight of authority refuses to apply usury laws to time-sale transactions.— The owner may sell property at whatever price and on whatever terms he may determine. Accordingly, he may sell it at a stated \"cash price,\" or at stated \"time price,\" and the fact that the difference exceeds the rate of interest permitted by the usury laws is immaterial. Obviously, the time price differential must take account of factors not present in making a loan to a prime rate borrower - heavier handling charges, heavier collection charges and so forth. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-184.\n\nThis section is equally inapplicable to revolving credit plans.1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-184.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —45 Am. Jur. 2d Interest and Usury §§ 166 to 237.\n\nTaking or charging interest in advance as usury, 57 A.L.R.2d 630.\n\nUsury as affected by repayment of, or borrower's option to repay, loan before maturity, 75 A.L.R.2d 1265.\n\nWhat is \"compound interest\" within meaning of statutes prohibiting the charging of such interest, 10 A.L.R.3d 421.\n\nContingency as to borrower's receipt of money or other property from which loan is to be repaid as rendering loan usurious, 92 A.L.R.3d 623.\n\nLeaving part of loan on deposit with lender as usury, 92 A.L.R.3d 769.\n\nEnforceability of provision in loan commitment agreement authorizing lender to charge standby fee, commitment fee or similar deposit, 93 A.L.R.3d 1156.\n\nApplication of usury laws to transactions characterized as \"leases,\" 94 A.L.R.3d 640.\n\nValidity and construction of provision of mortgage or other real-estate financing contract prohibiting prepayment for a fixed period of time, 81 A.L.R.4th 423.\n\nConstruction and application of Consumer Credit Protection Act provisions (18 USCS §§ 891-894) prohibiting extortionate credit transactions, 106 A.L.R.

In case the greater rate of interest has been paid, the person by whom it has been paid, or his legal representatives, may recover back by civil action twice the amount of the interest thus paid from the person, corporation or association taking or receiving the same; provided that such action is commenced within two (2) years from the time the usurious transaction occurred.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 50-6-18, enacted by Laws 1957, ch. 209, § 4.\n\nExcess knowingly charged deemed usury.— Where an agreement provides security for the loan at a rate of interest in excess of that allowed for secured indebtedness under this statute, it was therefore usurious since the taking, receiving, reserving or charging of that rate was knowingly done.Hays v. Hudson, 1973-NMSC-086, 85 N.M. 512, 514 P.2d 31,overruled on other grounds byMaulsby v. Magnuson, 1988-NMSC-046, 107 N.M. 223, 755 P.2d 67.\n\nAny excess profit for use of money deemed usury.— Profit greater than the lawful rate of interest intentionally charged for the loan or forbearance of money is a violation of the usury law, though in the form of a bonus or commission.Anderson v. Beadle, 1931-NMSC-040, 35 N.M. 654, 5 P.2d 528,overruled on other grounds byHays v. Hudson, 1973-NMSC-086, 85 N.M. 512, 514 P.2d 31;Scottish Mortg. & Land Inv. Co. v.

Ed. 729 (1894) (decided under former law).\n\nReduced price sale of stock in addition to maximum interest deemed usurious.— Usury must exist at the inception of an agreement; and where a sale of stock at a reduced price was a condition of the loan and according to the uncontradicted testimony of one of the borrowers, the reduced price was to constitute additional interest of some 7% over and above the approximately 10% provided for in the note, it was held that usury was present in the transactions from the outset.First Nat'l Bank v. Danek, 1976-NMSC-077, 89 N.M. 623, 556 P.2d 31.\n\nSpecific intent required.— Knowingly charging an illegal interest rate requires a showing of some usurious intent to exploit.Maulsby v. Magnuson, 1988-NMSC-046, 107 N.M. 223, 755 P.2d 67.\n\nBorrower's obligation complete upon payment of principal.— Where plaintiff-lender was shown to have knowingly charged an illegal rate of interest on certain loans, it was held that the obligation of defendant-borrowers, who had received the benefit of $56,024 from the various transactions, and had made payments of $57,547.22, was completed.First Nat'l Bank v. Danek, 1976-NMSC-077, 89 N.M. 623, 556 P.2d 31.\n\nApplies where application of foreign law shocks court.— Where interest contracted for is greatly in excess of that allowable under New Mexico law, New Mexico courts are relieved of any obligation to consider whether foreign law is applicable as the law of the contract, and/or whether such law would allow interest rates such as those charged.Trinidad Indus. Bank v. Romero, 1970-NMSC-038, 81 N.M. 291, 466 P.2d 568.\n\nAttorney's fees to collect permissible debt allowed.— When the effect thereof is not to render the contract void, but merely to forfeit the interest, usury in a loan will not prevent the recovery of reasonable attorney's fees provided for, where suit is necessary to enforce the obligation to the extent permitted by law. Attorney's fees will not be allowed, however, for attempts to collect the usurious portion of the interest.Hays v. Hudson, 1973-NMSC-086, 85 N.M. 512, 514 P.2d 31,overruled on other grounds byMaulsby v. Magnuson, 1988-NMSC-046, 107 N.M. 223, 755 P.2d 67.\n\nAttorney's fees not allowed for collection of usurious interest.— Where at the time suit was commenced, the lender had no legal cause of action against the defendants since the note was usurious and payment on the net principal had been made, the lender's attorneys were not entitled to attorney's fees, and the order of the trial court allowing attorney's fees was reversed.First Nat'l Bank v. Danek, 1976-NMSC-077, 89 N.M. 623, 556 P.2d 31.\n\nBorrower's performance prerequisite to affirmative recovery.— Absent performance by the borrower, this section serves borrower only as a shield by way of recoupment, so that the affirmative right of borrower to recover over against the lender or in an independent suit accrued only in the event of performance by the borrower.Stiff v. Fogerson, 1954-NMSC-031, 58 N.M. 193, 269 P.2d 743 (decided under former law).\n\nCause accrues upon payment of amount greater than principal and legal interest.— The limitation of three years, within which borrower may sue for double the amount of usurious interest collected and received from him, does not commence to run, and, therefore, the cause of action does not accrue, until the lender has actually collected or received more than the original debt with legal interest.McBroom v.
