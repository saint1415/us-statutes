Att'y Gen. No. 57-41.\n\nPower to arrest same as private citizen.— Unless called in specific instances to assist law enforcement officers, officer's power to arrest is no different than that of a private citizen. Throughout the statutes it is seen that authority to arrest, other than as a private citizen, exists only when there is a specific request from regular law enforcement officers. And it is further apparent that when called upon to assist law enforcement agencies that patrol's conduct shall be under their direction and control. The commission which is issued can, of course, have no more force than the authority given by the statutes under which that commission is issued. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6350.\n\nUniform unnecessary to exercise authority.— It is not necessary that mounted patrol be in uniform in order to exercise the authority which it has. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6350.\n\nExtra-hazardous duty not performed under color of employment agreement.— A trooper or officer of the New Mexico mounted patrol, in carrying out duties as provided, is without question engaging in extra-hazardous activities. However, such extra-hazardous duty is not being performed under any color of an employment agreement. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-41.",

As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"criminal record\" means information concerning a person's arrests, indictments or other formal criminal charges and any dispositions arising from them, including convictions, dismissals, acquittals, sentencing and correctional supervision, collected by criminal justice agencies and stored in the databases of the federal bureau of investigation, the national law enforcement telecommunications system, the department of public safety or the repositories of criminal history information of other states; and\n\n(2) \"criminal history screening\" means a criminal history background investigation of an applicant for the New Mexico mounted patrol conducted by using fingerprints collected by the department of public safety or a local law enforcement agency and submitted to the federal bureau of investigation.\n\nB. The New Mexico mounted patrol shall perform a criminal history screening on all applicants for mounted patrol. If an applicant has a criminal record, his application for a commission in the mounted patrol may be denied. If an applicant has a felony conviction or a conviction for a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, his application for a commission in the mounted patrol shall be denied.\n\nC. The chief of the New Mexico state police shall determine whether to grant a commission to an applicant who has a criminal record that did not result in conviction of a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude. The chief's decision to deny an application for a commission in the mounted patrol is final and may not be appealed.\n\nD. An applicant for the New Mexico mounted patrol shall be fingerprinted and the applicant shall provide two fingerprint cards or the equivalent electronic fingerprints to the mounted patrol to assist the mounted patrol in conducting a criminal history screening of the applicant. The applicant shall pay the cost of the criminal history screening. The mounted patrol shall not charge the applicant more than the actual cost of the nationwide criminal history screening.\n\nHistory:Laws 1999, ch. 121, § 1.",

      "text": "A. Members of the New Mexico mounted patrol may be detailed to assist and render aid in specific instances involving law enforcement or other matters when request is made for such assistance and aid by the New Mexico state police or other state or local law enforcement agencies. When acting upon such call, members shall be deemed to be the agents or deputies of the authority issuing such request, shall be possessed of the same powers and duties as such requesting authorities and shall be completely covered by the Workmen's [Workers'] Compensation Act [Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978] if the employer's insurance policy is endorsed to clearly show that its coverage extends to the claimant.\n\nB. For purposes of calculating the amount of any mounted patrol member's disability or death benefits pursuant to the Workmen's [Workers'] Compensation Act, the member's average weekly wages shall be deemed to be the average weekly wages the member was receiving from any and every employer, regardless of whether the member's employment with such employer was covered in fact by the Workmen's [Workers'] Compensation Act. The degree of disability, if any, shall be determined on the basis of the member's disability in regard to such other employment.\n\nC. If a mounted patrol member is covered by workmen's compensation coverage pursuant to Subsection A of this section, the Workmen's [Workers'] Compensation Act shall be his exclusive remedy against the mounted patrol and the supervising law enforcement agency for any injury or death proximately caused by accident arising out of and in the course of the member's duties.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 66-1106, enacted by Laws 1941, ch. 149, § 6; 1953 Comp., § 9-11-6; Laws 1961, ch. 241, § 1; 1983, ch. 247, § 1.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nMeaning of \"state police\".— When the statute refers to the New Mexico state police without any qualification, it grants power to any regularly appointed, active member of the state police to call upon a member of the mounted patrol for assistance. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-239.\n\nState police may call for law enforcement matters only.— The mounted patrol may only be called upon by the state police for matters involving law enforcement, to assist and render aid to the state police, and for other matters related to the function of the state police. The statute does not contemplate calling upon members of the mounted patrol for training purposes, and the state police may not call upon members of the mounted patrol for the purpose of giving training to the mounted patrol. But where the purpose is law enforcement, or to render assistance to the state police in a proper function of the state police, then any member of the state police is authorized to call out members of the mounted patrol for assistance. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-239.\n\nWhen no actual emergency exists,a member of the mounted patrol whose assistance is requested by the state police must be furnished the request in writing, signed by the officer making the request. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-239.\n\nNo state insurance or compensation plan coverage.— Members of the New Mexico mounted patrol are not covered by any state insurance or compensation plan during periods of service as provided. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-41.\n\nIf group insurance is acquired, then classification is as a unit.— For purposes of acquiring group insurance protection, a troop of the New Mexico mounted patrol was classified as a unit or group under former Section 59-18-16 NMSA 1978. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-41.",
