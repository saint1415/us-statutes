      "heading": "Investigation of criminal violations; commencement of prosecution; cooperation; removal",
      "text": "It is hereby declared to be the duty of every sheriff, deputy sheriff, constable and every other peace officer to investigate all violations of the criminal laws of the state which are called to the attention of any such officer or of which he is aware, and it is also declared the duty of every such officer to diligently file a complaint or information, if the circumstances are such as to indicate to a reasonably prudent person that such action should be taken, and it is also declared his duty to cooperate with and assist the attorney general, district attorney or other prosecutor, if any, in all reasonable ways. Such cooperation shall include the prompt reporting of all arrests for liquor law violations at licensed liquor establishments to the department of alcoholic beverage control. Failure to perform his duty in any material way shall subject such officer to removal from office and payment of all costs of prosecution.\n\nHistory:Laws 1921, ch. 170, § 1; C.S. 1929, § 33-4433; 1941 Comp., § 40-101; 1953 Comp., § 31-1-1; Laws 1979, ch. 37, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For New Mexico mounted patrol,see29-6-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor sheriffs generally,see4-41-2 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor state parks and recreation areas, police powers of superintendent and state park and recreation commission employees,see16-2-30 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor game laws, enforcement,see17-2-19 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor trappers' and fur dealers' law, duty to enforce,see17-5-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor disabled persons, search of person, clothing and effects for identifying device,see28-8-2, 28-8-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor carrying of weapons by peace officers,see30-7-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor resisting or obstructing an officer, penalty,see30-22-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor forest fire laws, duties,see30-32-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor uniformed guards of corrections department, peace officer powers,see33-1-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor Detoxification Reform Act,seeChapter 43, Article 2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor arrests under motor vehicle laws,see66-8-122 NMSA 1978 et seq.\n\nFor livestock board, sheriffs and peace officers to execute orders of,see77-3-2, 77-3-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nPlainclothes officer can intrude when he observes truck driven erratically.— This section does not preclude plainclothes officer from making intrusion into pickup truck by opening a door where officer has observed truck being driven rapidly and in an erratic manner and, reaching truck after it has stopped, has observed that occupant appeared incoherent and lacked understanding of request to roll down window. Such facts warranted the officer, as person of reasonable caution, to open the pickup door.State v. Ray, 1977-NMCA-100, 91 N.M. 67, 570 P.2d 605, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 4, 569 P.2d 413.\n\nLiability for failure to take proper actions.— A governmental entity and its law enforcement officers may be held liable, after receiving notice, for negligently failing to take adequate action to protect a citizen from imminent danger and injury because of failure to adopt proper procedures for responding to and investigating a reported criminal act.Schear v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1984-NMSC-079, 101 N.M. 671, 687 P.2d 728.\n\nLiability for failure to cooperate with prosecutors.— The statutory obligations that officers cooperate with prosecutors and bring defendants before the courts are primarily designed to protect the public by ensuring that dangerous criminals are removed from society and brought to justice; accordingly, as with the duty to investigate crimes under this section, the duties of cooperating with prosecutors, diligently filing complaints, and bringing defendants before the courts inure to the benefit of private individuals, and the violation of these statutory duties may give rise to a cognizable claim under the Tort Claims Act, Sections 41-4-1 through 41-4-27 NMSA 1978.Weinstein v. City of Santa Fe ex rel. Santa Fe Police Dep't, 1996-NMSC-021, 121 N.M. 646, 916 P.2d 1313.\n\nLiability for failure to detain intoxicated driver.— Law enforcement officers may be liable if they fail to detain an intoxicated driver, who then acts with the requisite level of intent to commit a battery while driving intoxicated.Blea v. City of Espanola, 1994-NMCA-008, 117 N.M. 217, 870 P.2d 755, cert. denied, 117 N.M. 328, 871 P.2d 984.\n\nImmunity from liability for wrongful issuance of warrant.— Police officers and assistant district attorney were immune from liability for alleged wrongful issuance and service of a search warrant which was valid on its face in which court ordered police officers to search for child, take him into custody, keep him safely and make a return of the proceedings on the warrant.Torres v. Glasgow, 1969-NMCA-053, 80 N.M. 412, 456 P.2d 886.\n\nClass of persons to be protected by duty to investigate.— In creating the duty to investigate, the legislature did not limit the traditional tort concept of foreseeability that would otherwise define the intended beneficiaries of the statute; all persons who are foreseeably at risk within the general population are within the class of persons to be protected by the duty to investigate.Torres v. State, 1995-NMSC-025, 119 N.M. 609, 894 P.2d 386.\n\nWhen any person of the public, regardless of geographic location, is foreseeably at risk of injury by a party reported to be in violation of the criminal law, officers undertaking the investigation of the crime owe that person a duty to exercise the care ordinarily exercised by prudent and qualified officers.Torres v. State, 1995-NMSC-025, 119 N.M. 609, 894 P.2d 386.\n\nForeseeability of criminal act.— Since it is not unlikely that a murderer would flee the city in which he committed the crime and, given modern-day transportation, that this person would flee across state lines, and since the police knew or should have known that it is possible that a person who kills randomly with no motive would kill again, the harm in this case was not so removed from the conduct of the defendants that the court may say as a matter of law that the victims were unforeseeable; thus foreseeability is a question for the jury to determine by giving thought to, among other things, the time, space, and distance between the alleged failure to investigate and the deaths of the two victims.Torres v. State, 1995-NMSC-025, 119 N.M. 609, 894 P.2d 386.\n\nSufficiency of allegations in complaint.— Allegations in a complaint that sheriff deputies failed to apprehend a drunk driver or investigate a tavern disturbance, and that this failure proximately caused personal injury to the plaintiff's family, sufficed to state a cause of action for negligent violation of a right secured under New Mexico law for which Section 41-4-12 NMSA 1978 waives sovereign immunity.California First Bank v. State Dep't of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 1990-NMSC-106, 111 N.M. 64, 801 P.2d 646.\n\nConstables may carry firearmsbecause they are peace officers. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-117.\n\nMagistrate or municipal court case may not be continued where appeal filed.— A peace officer who has prosecuted a criminal case in magistrate or municipal court may not continue to prosecute the case in district court after an appeal of the magistrate or municipal court judgment has been filed in district court. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-27.\n\nSheriff may file complaint without consent of district attorney.— The sheriff may file a complaint against a party for game law violation without first obtaining the consent of, or consulting, the district attorney. He should, before filing any criminal charge, consult his district attorney, except perhaps in cases of emergency where the sheriff waives a warrant on hearing in order to arrest someone who is believed about to leave the country. 1939 Op. Att'y Gen. 39-3257.\n\nWhen district attorney has authority to appear in court.— The district attorney as chief law enforcement officer has the authority to appear in any case filed before any justice of the peace (now magistrate court) in any county in his district when, in his opinion, the interests of the people in his district require his participation in any case filed before a justice of the peace (magistrate) in said district. 1953 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 53-5669.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Criminal Procedure - New Mexico Denies Fifth Amendment Protection to Corporations:John Doe and Five Unnamed Corporations v. State ex rel.

All persons who are duly commissioned officers of the police or sheriff's department of any New Mexico Indian nation, tribe or pueblo or who are law enforcement officers employed by the bureau of Indian affairs and are assigned in New Mexico are, when commissioned under Subsection B of this section, recognized and authorized to act as New Mexico peace officers. These officers have all the powers of New Mexico peace officers to enforce state laws in New Mexico, including the power to make arrests for violation of state laws.\n\nB. The chief of the New Mexico state police is granted authority to issue commissions as New Mexico peace officers to members of the police or sheriff's department of any New Mexico Indian nation, tribe or pueblo or a law enforcement officer employed by the bureau of Indian affairs to implement the provisions of this section. The procedures to be followed in the issuance and revocation of commissions and the respective rights and responsibilities of the departments shall be set forth in a written agreement to be executed between the chief of the New Mexico state police and the Indian nation, tribe or pueblo or the appropriate federal official.\n\nC. The agreement referred to in Subsection B of this section shall contain the following conditions:\n\n(1) the Indian nation, tribe or pueblo, but not the bureau of Indian affairs, shall submit proof of adequate public liability and property damage insurance for vehicles operated by the peace officers and police professional liability insurance from a company licensed to sell insurance in the state;\n\n(2) each applicant for a commission shall successfully complete four hundred hours of basic police training that is approved by the director of the New Mexico law enforcement academy;\n\n(3) the chief of the New Mexico state police shall have the authority to suspend any commission granted pursuant to Subsection B of this section for reasons solely within the chief's discretion;\n\n(4) if any provision of the agreement is violated by the Indian nation, tribe or pueblo or any of its agents, the chief of the New Mexico state police shall suspend the agreement on five days' notice, which suspension shall last until the chief is satisfied that the violation has been corrected and will not recur;\n\n(5) the goldenrod-colored officer's second copy of any citation issued pursuant to a commission authorized by this section shall be submitted within five days to the chief of the New Mexico state police;\n\n(6) any citation issued pursuant to a commission authorized by this section shall be to a magistrate court of New Mexico; except that any citations issued to Indians within the exterior boundaries of an Indian reservation shall be cited into tribal court;\n\n(7) the agreement or any commission issued pursuant to it shall not confer any authority on a tribal court or other tribal authority that the court or authority would not otherwise have;\n\n(8) the authority conferred by any agreement entered into pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be coextensive with the exterior boundaries of the reservation; except that an officer commissioned under this section may proceed in hot pursuit of an offender beyond the exterior boundaries of the reservation, and the authority conferred in any written agreement between the chief of the New Mexico state police and the Navajo Nation may extend beyond the exterior boundaries of the Navajo reservation to and including the area enclosed by the following description:\n\nBeginning at a point where the southern boundary line of the Navajo Nation reservation intersects the western right-of-way line of US 491, and running thence; southerly along the western right-of-way line of US 491 to the northerly city limits of Gallup; thence, easterly along the northerly city limits of Gallup to the northern side of the right of way of I-40; thence, in an easterly direction along the northerly side of the right of way of I-40 to the northerly limits of the village of Prewitt; thence, in a straight line between the northerly boundary of the village of Prewitt to the southerly boundary of Ambrosia Lake;

thence, along the eastern and southerly borders of the Navajo Nation reservation to the point of beginning.\n\nThe municipalities of Cuba and Gallup and the villages of Thoreau and Prewitt are excluded from the grant of authority that may be conferred in any written agreement entered into pursuant to provisions of this section; provided, however, any written agreement may include under such grant of authority the communities of Ambrosia Lake, Hospah, Torreon, Lybrook, Nageezi, Counselors and Blanco Trading Post and those communities commonly known as the Wingate community; the Navajo Nation Blue Water ranch area of the Thoreau community; the Prewitt community, exclusive of the village of Prewitt; the Haystack community; the Desidero community; the Sand Springs community; the Rincon Marquis community; the Charley Jesus Arviso and the Castillo community; and state road 264 beginning at the point where it intersects US 491 and ending where state road 264 intersects the Arizona-New Mexico state line; and\n\n(9) the chief of the New Mexico state police or the chief's designee and the Indian nation, tribe or pueblo or the appropriate federal official shall be required to meet at least quarterly or more frequently at the call of the chief of the New Mexico state police to discuss the status of the agreement and invite other law enforcement or other officials to attend as necessary.\n\nD. Nothing in this section impairs or affects the existing status and sovereignty of an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo as established under the laws of the United States.\n\nE. All persons who are duly commissioned federal law enforcement officers employed by the federal bureau of investigation; drug enforcement administration; bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms; United States secret service; United States customs service; immigration and naturalization service; United States marshals service; postal inspection service; United States probation department; and United States pretrial services agency; and other appropriate federal officers whose primary duty is law enforcement related, who are assigned in New Mexico and who are required to be designated by the county sheriff on a case-by-case basis in the county in which they are working, are recognized and authorized to act as New Mexico peace officers and have all the powers of New Mexico peace officers to enforce state laws in New Mexico, including the power to make arrests for violation of state laws. The department of public safety shall maintain a registry that lists the name and affiliated federal agency of every federal law enforcement officer recognized and authorized to act as a New Mexico peace officer pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. This subsection shall not be construed to impose liability upon or to require indemnification by the state for any act performed by a federal law enforcement officer pursuant to this subsection.\n\nF. The provisions of Subsection E of this section regarding designation of federal law enforcement officers by a county sheriff do not apply to federal law enforcement officers who are duly commissioned officers of a police or sheriff's department for an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo in New Mexico or who are federal law enforcement officers employed by the bureau of Indian affairs.\n\nG. Nothing in this section limits, impairs or nullifies the authority of county sheriffs to appoint pursuant to Chapter 4, Article 41 NMSA 1978 duly commissioned state or federally certified officers who are employees of a police or sheriff's department of an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo in New Mexico or who are federal law enforcement officers employed by the bureau of Indian affairs as deputy sheriffs authorized to enforce New Mexico criminal and traffic law.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 39-1-12, enacted by Laws 1972, ch. 8, § 1; 1979, ch. 39, § 1; 1981, ch. 120, § 1; 1983, ch. 275, § 1; 1988, ch. 14, § 3; 1993, ch. 179, § 1; 1995, ch. 186, § 1; 1997, ch. 260, § 1; 2002, ch. 92, § 1; 2005, ch. 290, § 1.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added Subsection G to provide that nothing in this section limits, impairs or nullifies the authority of county sheriffs to appoint duly commissioned state or federally certified officers who are employees of a police or sheriff's department of an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo in New Mexico or who are federal law enforcement officers employed by the bureau of Indian affairs as deputy sheriffs authorized to enforce New Mexico criminal and traffic law.\n\nThe 2002 amendment,effective May 15, 2002, deleted \"payment\" following \"authority\" in the section heading; and deleted Paragraph C(10), which provided for payment from the law enforcement protection fund to tribes or pueblos for each commissioned peace officer in the tribe or pueblo.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective July 1, 1997, in Subsection E, in the first sentence, inserted \"United States probation department; United States pretrial services agency;\", deleted \"as designated by the chief of the New Mexico state police upon a recommendation by a county sheriff\" preceding \"who are assigned\", and inserted \"and who are required to be designated by the county sheriff on a case-by-case basis in the county in which they are working\", added the second sentence; and added Subsection F.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, substituted \"pursuant to provisions of\" for \"under\" near the end of Paragraph (8) in Subsection C, and in Subsection E deleted \"and\" preceding \"postal\" and substituted \"whose primary duty is law enforcement related, as designated by the chief of the New Mexico state police upon a recommendation by a county sheriff\" for \"as designated by the chief of the New Mexico state police\".\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, inserted \"payment\" and substituted \"commissioned peace officers\" for \"commissioning\" in the section heading; added Paragraph (10) of Subsection C; and made minor stylistic changes in Paragraphs (2), (4), (8), and (9) of Subsection C and in Subsection E.\n\nTribal officer was properly cross-commissioned.— Where defendant, who was a non-Indian, was arrested by a Pueblo police officer on property of the Pueblo and charged in a county magistrate court with aggravated DWI; the officer was cross-commissioned as a county special deputy sheriff by the county sheriff's office; the officer signed an oath of office that was also signed by the county sheriff and carried a card issued by the county sheriff's office indicating the officer's cross-commissioning status; the officer was wearing the Pueblo police department uniform at the time of the arrest; the officer was a commissioned, full-time Pueblo tribal officer; and the officer's salary was paid by the Pueblo police department and included incremental pay financed from a grant from the bureau of Indian affairs to assist the Pueblo police department in targeting the motoring public, the officer was properly cross-commissioned and could properly arrest defendant while wearing the uniform of and receiving a salary from the Pueblo police department.State v. Sanchez, 2014-NMCA-095.\n\nOff-reservations crimes.— State officers have the authority to enter Indian country to investigate off-reservation crimes committed in their presence by Indians, so long as the investigation does not infringe on tribal sovereignty by circumventing or contravening a governing tribal procedure. A traffic stop which included the administration of field sobriety tests, did not circumvent or contravene the Navajo Nation Code and, therefore, did not infringe on the sovereignty of the Navajo Nation.State v. Harrison, 2010-NMSC-038, 148 N.M. 500, 238 P.3d 869,aff'g2008-NMCA-107, 144 N.M. 651, 190 P.3d 1146.\n\nAuthority of non-cross-commissioned officer.— A state police officer, who is not cross-commissioned with the bureau of Indian affairs or the tribe, may pursue an Indian onto the reservation, across jurisdictional lines, for a minor traffic offense committed outside the reservation and after determining that the officer lacks jurisdiction, the officer may continue to detain the Indian and collect evidence for use against him.State v. Harrison, 2008-NMCA-107, 144 N.M. 651, 190 P.3d 1146,aff'd, 2010-NMSC-038, 148 N.M. 500, 238 P.3d 869.\n\nInconsistency between written agreements.— It is inconsistent for the legislature to require a written agreement for the issuance of a cross commission under this section between state law enforcement and Indian tribal police officers and not require a written agreement for mutual aid agreements under Section 29-8-3 NMSA 1978.State v. Branham, 2004-NMCA-131, 136 N.M. 579, 102 P.3d 646.\n\nAuthority of cross-commissioned officer.— Traffic stop and detention and arrest are not illegal where Navajo tribal officer acted as a New Mexico peace officer with authority to enforce the Motor Vehicle Code on non-Indian land in the city of Gallup.State v. Martinez, 2005-NMCA-052, 137 N.M. 432, 112 P.3d 293, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-005, 137 N.M. 522, 113 P.3d 345.\n\nBecause Navajo tribal officer claims to have been deputized by the McKinley County sheriff, Subsection C(8) of Section 29-1-11 NMSA 1978 does not defeat his claimed authority to act as a cross-commissioned county deputy.State v. Martinez, 2005-NMCA-052, 137 N.M. 432, 112 P.3d 293, cert. denied, 2005-NMCERT-005, 137 N.M. 522, 113 P.3d 345.\n\nAuthority of non-cross-commissioned officers.— A non-cross-commissioned federal police officer has the lawful authority not only to stop a motor vehicle within an Indian reservation, but also to issue the driver a federal traffic citation based on state law.Ryder v. State, 1982-NMSC-066, 98 N.M. 316, 648 P.2d 774.\n\nA non-cross-commissioned bureau of Indian affairs officer is empowered to stop a vehicle within the borders of an Indian reservation for a traffic law offense and, upon determining that the offender is a non-Indian, to request him to wait until a cross-commissioned BIA officer arrives.State v. Ryder, 1981-NMCA-017, 98 N.M. 453, 649 P.2d 756,aff'd, 1982-NMSC-066, 98 N.M. 316, 648 P.2d 774.\n\nAuthority of tribal police officer over non-Indian.— A tribal police officer has the authority to stop and issue a tribal citation, and arrest a non-Indian, so long as the Indian authorities promptly deliver up the non-Indian offender, rather than try and punish him themselves.State v. Ryder, 1981-NMCA-017, 98 N.M. 453, 649 P.2d 756,aff'd, 1982-NMSC-066, 98 N.M. 316, 648 P.2d 774.\n\nWhere state police officer initially stopped defendant for speedingon Mescalero reservation, because the officer did not have authority to enforce Mescalero tribal traffic ordinances, defendant's motion to suppress evidence was properly granted.State v. Branham, 2004-NMCA-131, 136 N.M. 579, 102 P.3d 646.\n\nCitations issued to non-Indians.— Traffic citations lawfully issued by a commissioned bureau of Indian affairs officer to a non-Indian cannot legally be referred to a tribal court, but should be referred to state magistrate court. 1992 Op.

      "text": "A. A law enforcement agency shall require peace officers the agency employs and who routinely interact with the public to wear a body-worn camera while on duty, except as provided in Subsection B of this section. Each law enforcement agency subject to the provisions of this section shall adopt policies and procedures governing the use of body-worn cameras, including:\n\n(1) requiring activation of a body-worn camera whenever a peace officer is responding to a call for service or at the initiation of any other law enforcement or investigative encounter between a peace officer and a member of the public;\n\n(2) prohibiting deactivation of a body-worn camera until the conclusion of a law enforcement or investigative encounter;\n\n(3) requiring that any video recorded by a body-worn camera shall be retained by the law enforcement agency for not less than one hundred twenty days; and\n\n(4) establishing disciplinary rules for peace officers who:\n\n(a) fail to operate a body-worn camera in accordance with law enforcement agency policies;\n\n(b) intentionally manipulate a body-worn camera recording; or\n\n(c) prematurely erase a body-worn camera recording in violation of law enforcement agency policies.\n\nB. The provisions of Subsection A of this section shall not apply when a peace officer:\n\n(1) conducts an undercover operation sanctioned by a law enforcement agency; or\n\n(2) conducts an explosive recovery and disposal operation to render safe or disassemble an explosive or incendiary device and materials.\n\nC. Peace officers who fail to comply with the policies and procedures required to be adopted pursuant to Subsection A of this section may be presumed to have acted in bad faith and may be deemed liable for the independent tort of negligent spoliation of evidence or the independent tort of intentional spoliation of evidence.\n\nD. As used in this section:\n\n(1) \"body-worn camera\" means an electronic device worn on a person's body that records both audio and video data;\n\n(2) \"law enforcement agency\" means the police department of a municipality, the sheriff's office of a county, the New Mexico state police or the department of public safety;\n\n(3) \"peace officer\" means any full-time salaried or certified part-time salaried officer who by virtue of office or public employment is vested by law with the duty to maintain the public peace; and\n\n(4) \"undercover operation\" means an operation that:\n\n(a) is conducted by one or more law enforcement agencies that is focused on a suspect or suspects who are the target of an ongoing criminal investigation;\n\n(b) involves one or more covert operatives whose identities are concealed and kept confidential; and\n\n(c) is designed to either obtain information about criminal activity of individuals or organizations through the development of ongoing relationships with individuals or organizations or to effect an arrest.\n\nHistory:Laws 2020 (1st S.S.), ch. 7, § 1; 2023, ch. 47, § 1.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, provided exceptions to the requirement that law enforcement use body-worn cameras, and defined \"undercover operation\" as used in this section; in the section heading, added \"exceptions\"; in Subsection A, after \"while on duty\", added \"except as provided in Subsection B of this section\"; added a new Subsection B and redesignated former Subsections B and C as Subsections C and D, respectively; in Subsection C, after \"Subsection A of this section\", deleted \"shall\" and added \"may\", and after \"bad faith and\", deleted \"shall\" and added \"may\"; and in Subsection D, added Paragraph D(4).\n\nNew Mexico Livestock Board inspectors are not law enforcement officers subject to body-worn camera requirements.— Although the New Mexico Livestock Board has certain law enforcement functions, and livestock inspectors routinely respond to calls and conduct investigations of livestock-related crimes, the legislature included a specific definition of \"law enforcement agency\" for purposes of construing the body-worn camera requirements of this section, and the livestock board or its inspectors were not included in this definition; the livestock board's absence from the definition of \"law enforcement agency\" evinces the legislative intent to limit the statute's applicability to only certain law enforcement agencies, which would exclude the livestock board and its inspectors from the requirements of this section. 2024 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 24-01.",
