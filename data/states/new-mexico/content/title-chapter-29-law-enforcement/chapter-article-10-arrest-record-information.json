      "text": "Chapter 29, Article 10 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Arrest Record Information Act\".\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 39-10-1, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 260, § 1; 1993, ch. 260, § 2.\n\nCross references.— For right to inspect public records,see14-2-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor children's code, confidentiality of social and legal records,see32A-2-32 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, substituted \"Chapter 29, Article 10 NMSA 1978\" for \"This act\".\n\nArticle does not authorize expungement.— The Arrest Records Information Act [Chapter 29, Article 10 NMSA 1978] does not grant the courts authority to expunge or seal criminal records.Toth v. Albuquerque Police Dep't, 1997-NMCA-079, 123 N.M. 637, 944 P.2d 285.\n\nArrest Record Information Act may be viewed as establishing statutory exceptionsto the fundamental right to inspect. It does so, however, in a rather conflicting manner, and it appears that virtually all arrest record information is subject to at least a limited or conditional disclosure. 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-09.\n\nIdentity of individuals arrested or charged with crime not protected.— Neither the Arrest Record Information Act [Chapter 29, Article 10 NMSA 1978] nor the Inspection of Public Records Act [Chapter 14, Article 2 NMSA 1978] authorizes a law enforcement agency to protect the identity of persons who have been arrested or charged with a crime. 1994 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 94-02.\n\nRelease of timely, accurate information.— The Arrest Record Information Act does not prohibit release of timely, accurate information when a juvenile is arrested for a criminal act. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-29.",

Nothing prevents a law enforcement agency from disclosing to the public arrest record information related to the offense for which an adult individual is currently within the criminal justice system. A law enforcement agency is not prohibited from confirming prior arrest record information to members of the news media or any other person, upon specific inquiry as to whether a named individual was arrested, detained, indicted or whether an information or other formal charge was filed on a specified date, if the arrest record information disclosed is based on data enumerated by Subsection A of this section.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 39-10-8, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 339, § 4; 1993, ch. 260, § 5.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1977, ch. 339, § 4 repealed 39-10-8, 1953 Comp., relating to the application of the Arrest Record Information Act, and enacted a new section.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, in Subsection A, in the introductory language, deleted \"The provisions of the Arrest Record Information Act do not apply to criminal history record\", inserted \"the following documents shall be available for public inspection\" and made stylistic changes; and, in Subsection B, deleted \"in this act\" following \"Nothing\" near the beginning of the first sentence and made stylistic changes.\n\nInformation to be included in police blotter.— The following information may be appropriately included by a law enforcement agency in a police blotter or original record of entry: the name, physical description, place and date of birth, address and occupation of the individual arrested; the time and place of arrest; the offense for which the individual was arrested or detained; and the name of the arresting officer. This list should be interpreted as a minimum requirement but not to the exclusion of additional information which may presently appear on the initial records of entry or police blotters being used by some law enforcement agencies. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-37 (opinion superseded by 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-09).\n\nLimited privacy of accused.— Section 29-10-4 NMSA 1978 protects the confidentiality of information concerning the identity of a person who has been accused but not charged with a crime only if that information has been collected in connection with an investigation of, or otherwise relates to, another person who has been charged with committing a crime. However, information in other records which identifies a person accused but not charged with or arrested for a crime may be protected from public disclosure under Section 14-2-1 NMSA 1978 et seq. Finally, even if it would otherwise be protected under either statute, information about a person accused but not charged with a crime is open to public inspection if it is contained in a document listed in this section. 1994 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 94-02.\n\nRepeal and reenactment broadened exemption.— In the repeal and reenactment of this section, the phrase \"indexed chronologically\" in Subsection A(2) became \"compiled chronologically,\" thus removing the requirement that the records must be \"indexed\" to qualify as \"original records of entry.\" The phrase \"or long-standing custom\" was added also, thereby legitimating a long-standing custom by which many law enforcement agencies had released information from police blotters and other such original records. 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-09.\n\nMeaning of \"within the criminal justice system\".— While the statute does not specify what is meant by \"within the criminal justice system,\" the term appears to relate to the status of an adult who has been arrested or formally charged with a criminal offense until such time as there is a final \"negative disposition.\" 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-09.",
