      "text": "A. The legislature finds that:\n\n(1) sex offenders pose a significant risk of recidivism; and\n\n(2) the efforts of law enforcement agencies to protect their communities from sex offenders are impaired by the lack of information available concerning convicted sex offenders who live within the agencies' jurisdictions.\n\nB. The purpose of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act is to assist law enforcement agencies' efforts to protect their communities by:\n\n(1) requiring sex offenders who are residents of New Mexico to register with the county sheriff of the county in which the sex offender resides;\n\n(2) requiring sex offenders who are residents in other states, but who are employed in New Mexico or who attend school in New Mexico, to register with the county sheriff of the county in which the sex offender works or attends school;\n\n(3) requiring the establishment of a central registry for sex offenders; and\n\n(4) providing public access to information regarding certain registered sex offenders.\n\nHistory:Laws 1995, ch. 106, § 2; 1999, ch. 19, § 2.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, inserted \"and Notification\" in Subsection B, inserted \"who are residents of New Mexico\" in Paragraph B(1), added Paragraphs B(2) and B(4), redesignated former Paragraph B(2) as Paragraph B(3), and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nConstitutionality of act.— Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act does not violate either the federal or state ex post facto clause, does not violate either the federal or the state due process clause, and does not violate N.M. Const. art. IV, §ection 34.State v. Druktenis, 2004-NMCA-032, 135 N.M. 223, 86 P.3d 1050.\n\nWhere a constitutionally permissible retroactive application of Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act requirements to defendant made him subject to a probation violation if he knowingly failed to register and if he were found to have committed a felony by failing to register, this does not constitute a legislative act that changes rules of evidence or procedure in a pending case. Therefore, the legislative changes are too indirect, remote, and attenuated to be considered unconstitutional under N.M. Const. art. IV, § 34.State v. Druktenis, 2004-NMCA-032, 135 N.M. 223, 86 P.3d 1050.\n\nRetroactive application of Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act does not violate the ex post facto clause of the United States or New Mexico constitutions.State v. Druktenis, 2004-NMCA-032, 135 N.M. 223, 86 P.3d 1050.\n\nSex Offender Registration and Notification Act is part of New Mexico's law enforcement codeand not part of the criminal code.State v. Druktenis, 2004-NMCA-032, 135 N.M. 223, 86 P.3d 1050.\n\nLegislative intent.— Legislature's intent in enacting Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act was to enact a civil, remedial, regulatory, nonpunitive law.State v. Druktenis, 2004-NMCA-032, 135 N.M. 223, 86 P.3d 1050.\n\nNotification provisions are rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest, purpose, and goal.State v. Druktenis, 2004-NMCA-032, 135 N.M. 223, 86 P.3d 1050.\n\nThe State's interest in attempting to protect society from convicted sex offenders who pose a significant risk of recidivism is both legitimate and compelling.State v. Druktenis, 2004-NMCA-032, 135 N.M. 223, 86 P.3d 1050.\n\nPurpose and principal effect of notification provisionsare to inform the public for its own safety, not to punish or stigmatize and ostracize the offender.State v. Druktenis, 2004-NMCA-032, 135 N.M. 223, 86 P.3d 1050.",

1999, ch. 19, § 3; 2000, ch. 8, § 1; 2003 (1st S.S.), ch. 1, § 10; 2005, ch. 279, § 1; 2007, ch. 68, § 1; 2007, ch. 69, § 5; 2013, ch. 152, § 1.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective July 1, 2013, added terms and definitions; added Subsections A, C, E, F and J; in Paragraph (6) of Subsection I, after \"Section 30-4-1 NMSA 1978\", deleted \"the victim is less than eighteen years of age and the offender is not a parent of the victim\" and added \"committed with the intent to inflict a sexual offense\";

and defined \"sex offense\" to mean offenses or their equivalents in any other jurisdiction, including aggravated criminal sexual penetration.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2007, ch. 69, § 8 provided that Laws 2007, ch. 69, § 5 was applicable to a person convicted of a sex offense on or after July 1, 1995 and a person convicted of a sexual offense prior to July 1, 1995 and who, on July 1, 1995, was still incarcerated, on probation or on parole for commission of that sex offense.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective July 1, 2005, added the definition of \"conviction\" in Subsection A; added the definition of \"institution of higher education\" in Subsection B; added the definition of \"registration requirement\" in Subsection C; deleted the requirement that a person be eighteen years of age or older in the definition of \"sex offender\" in Subsection D;

and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nDetermination of equivalency of sex offenses.— Where defendant, who had been convicted of taking indecent liberties with children in North Carolina, moved to New Mexico; although there was no one-to-one correlation between the North Carolina offense and a single New Mexico sex offense, indecent liberties with children encompassed several sex offenses in New Mexico, the district court was required to determine if defendant's actual conduct supporting defendant's North Carolina conviction would have constituted any of the sex offenses under the New Mexico Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, Section 29-11A-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.State v. Orr, 2013-NMCA-069, 304 P.3d 449.\n\nEquivalent offense is based on actual conduct.— An offense is \"equivalent\" to a New Mexico offense, for purposes of the New Mexico Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, if the defendant's actual conduct that gave rise to the out-of-state conviction would have constituted one of the enumerated offenses requiring registration pursuant to the Act. When the defendant's out-of-state conviction results from a plea agreement, courts may look to the charging documents, the defendant's written plea agreement, and the transcript of the plea hearing to determine the defendant's actual conduct and whether the conduct would have constituted one of the enumerated offenses.State v. Hall, 2013-NMSC-001, 294 P.3d 1235,rev'g2011-NMCA-047, 149 N.M. 546, 252 P.3d 770.\n\nFailure to prove equivalent offense.— Where defendant had been convicted in California of a misdemeanor offense of annoying or molesting a child under the age of eighteen; the state alleged that the California offense was equivalent to the New Mexico crime of sexual contact of a minor in the fourth degree because defendant's California conviction was based on defendant inappropriately touching the private parts of several boys that defendant lifted up to look into a camera's viewfinder; and the state failed to provide evidence to support the elements of the New Mexico offense by establishing the California victim's ages at the time of the offense or, other than saying that defendant touched the victims' clothed private parts, where on their bodies defendant touched the California victims, a court could not determine whether defendant's conduct violated one of the enumerated offenses in Section 29-11A-3 NMSA 1978 because the record was insufficient for a court to determine in what conduct defendant engaged that gave rise to defendant's California conviction.State v. Hall, 2013-NMSC-001, 294 P.3d 1235,rev'g2011-NMCA-047, 149 N.M. 546, 252 P.3d 770.\n\nSex offense.— Defendant's conviction in California of the misdemeanor offense of annoying or molesting a child, which does not require touching or application of force, was not the equivalent of sexual contact of a minor, which requires touching or the application of force, was not a \"sex offense\" as that term is defined in the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, and did not require defendant to register as a sex offender in New Mexico.State v. Hall, 2011-NMCA-047, 149 N.M. 546, 252 P.3d 770, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.\n\nDetermining equivalency under SORNA.— Where defendant appealed from the judgment and sentence entered upon his conditional guilty plea to one count of failure to register as a sex offender, the trial court erred in ruling that defendant's Colorado conviction, had it occurred in New Mexico, required registration pursuant to SORNA, because the statute under which defendant was convicted in Colorado is not, on its face, equivalent to a SORNA offense, and the trial court's reliance on an unsigned and unfiled presentence report was not sufficient to determine actual conduct for purposes of an equivalency analysis under SORNA. The presentence report lacked proof of authenticity and reliability and therefore constituted inadmissible evidence that the trial court erred in considering and determining defendant's actual conduct underlying his Colorado sexual assault conviction.State v. Winn, 2019-NMCA-011.\n\nAnolo contendereplea which is a conviction in a foreign jurisdiction is a conviction in New Mexico.— Where petitioner plednolo contendereto engaging in a sex act with a child under eighteen years old in Florida; the Florida court required petitioner to serve thirty days imprisonment, two years of community control, five years of probation, pay restitution for mental counseling of the victim, have no unsupervised contact with children under eighteen years old, surrender the petitioner's teaching credentials and register as a sex offender in Florida; Florida did not adjudicate petitioner's guilt; and Florida law defined a conviction of a sex offense for purposes of sex offender registration to be a determination of guilt as the result of a plea ofnolo contendereregardless of whether adjudication is withheld, Florida's disposition of petitioner's case was a conviction for purposes of SORNA.Vives v. Verzino, 2009-NMCA-083, 146 N.M. 673, 213 P.3d 823.\n\n\"Sex offender\".— A court order granting defendant an early discharge from supervised probation and dismissing the charges against him did not eradicate his convictions and his status as a sex offender under Subsection A(1).State v. Brothers, 2002-NMCA-110, 133 N.M. 36, 59 P.3d 1268, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 30, 59 P.3d 1262.\n\nApplication of multiple amendments of definition of \"sex offense\".— Where in 2012, defendant pled guilty to the charge of solicitation of a child by electronic communication device; in 2007, the legislature enacted two acts amending Sections 29-11A-3 and 29-11A-5 NMSA 1978 which were signed on the same day by the governor; Laws 2007, ch. 68 created the new criminal offense of child solicitation by electronic communication device; Laws 2007, ch. 69 created the new crime of aggravated criminal sexual penetration; in 2012, Section 12-1-8 NMSA 1978 provided that if, in the same legislative session, the legislature enacted two or more acts amending the same section of the New Mexico Statutes Annotated, then the last act signed by the governor is presumed to be the law and shall be compiled into the NMSA; and Laws 2007, ch. 69 was compiled into the NMSA, child solicitation by electronic communication device was not a SORNA-covered crime in 2012 when defendant pled guilty and defendant was not subject to SORNA.State v. Ho, 2014-NMCA-038, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-003.",

The sex offender shall appear in person at a location designated by the department to verify the information contained on the form, to change the information as necessary and to sign a statement under oath that the information is true and correct. The department may photograph the sex offender at that time if the sex offender's appearance is significantly different from the photograph already contained in the sex offender's file. If a sex offender does not receive a verification form before the time that the sex offender is required to verify registration pursuant to Subsection L of this section, the sex offender shall appear at a location designated by the department to verify registration information as required by this section.\n\nO. The department shall establish a secure system that will permit a sex offender to notify the department electronically of any change in registration information.\n\nP.

A sex offender who willfully or knowingly fails to comply with the registration or verification requirements set forth in this section after a first or subsequent conviction for a violation pursuant to this section is guilty of a third degree felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978.

provided in Subsection C that a non-resident sex offender who is attending a public or private school or an institution of higher education in New Mexico shall register in the county in which the school or institution of higher education is located;

added Subsection J to require a sex offender to disclose his status if he is employed or enrolled as a student at a public or private school; added Subsection K to require a sex offender to disclose his status when he is employed, begins a vocation or volunteers his services; deleted the former provisions in Subsection L that a sex offender annually renew his registration prior to December 31 of each subsequent calendar year for a period of twenty years; provided in Subsection L that a sex offender shall renew his registration not less than once in each ninety-day period for his natural life; added Subsection M to provide that a sex offender who is convicted of a sex offense set forth in Section 29-11A-5E NMSA 1978, he shall renew his registration once in each ninety-day period for his natural life; provided in Subsection N that if a sex offender knowingly fails to comply with the registration requirement he is guilty of a fourth degree felony, that a sex offender who willfully or knowingly fails to comply with the registration requirements of this section after a first or subsequent conviction under this section is guilty of a third degree felony, that a willful failure to comply with the requirements of this section is a continuing transaction or occurrence, and that a conviction under Subsection N is not a felony for purposes of imposing sentencing enhancements; and provided in Subsection O that a sex offender who knowingly provides false information is guilty of a fourth degree felony, that a sex offender who willfully or knowingly provides false information after a first or subsequent conviction under this section is guilty of a third degree felony, that the willful providing of false information is a continuing transaction or occurrence and that a conviction under Subsection N is not a felony for purposes of imposing sentencing enhancements.\n\nApplicability.— Laws 2005, ch. 279, §14, effective July 1, 2005, provided that Laws 2005, ch. 279, §§ 1 through 13 apply to a person convicted of a sex offense on or after July 1, 2005 and a person convicted of a sex offense prior to July 1, 2005 and who, on July 1, 2005, was still incarcerated, on probation or on parole for commission of that sex offense.\n\nThe 2000 amendment,effective July 1, 2000, inserted \"registration\" near the end of the introductory paragraph in Subsection B and near the end of Subsection D; rewrote Subsection H, which formerly read \"Following his initial registration pursuant to the provisions of this section, a sex offender shall annually renew his registration with the county sheriff prior to December 31 of each subsequent calendar year\"; and substituted \"fourth degree felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978\" for \"misdemeanor and shall be punished by imprisonment for a definite term less than one year or a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or both\" in Subsections I and J.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, in Subsection B substituted \"ten days\" for \"thirty days\" in the first sentence and \"ten days\" for \"forty-five days\" in the second sentence; substituted \"he\" for \"the sex offender\" in Paragraph B(1); added present Subsections C, D, and H; and redesignated former Subsections C through E, F, and G as Subsections E through G, I, and J, respectively.\n\nStatutory elements of California and New Mexico offenses were not equivalent.— Defendant's conviction in California of the misdemeanor offense of annoying or molesting a child, which does not require touching or application of force, was not the equivalent of sexual contact of a minor, which requires touching or the application of force, was not a \"sex offense\" as that term is defined in the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, and did not require defendant to register as a sex offender in New Mexico.State v. Hall, 2011-NMCA-047, 149 N.M. 546, 252 P.3d 770, cert. granted, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.\n\nAssistance of counsel.— Defense counsel has an affirmative duty to advise a defendant charged with a sex offense that a plea of guilty or no contest will almost certainly subject the defendant to the registration requirements of SORNA. Proper advice will also include a discussion regarding what SORNA registration will mean, both in terms of the specific registration and notification provisions set forth in this article, as well as the likely social consequences of being a registered sex offender. This is the minimum advice a defendant needs before deciding to waive his or her constitutional rights by entering into a plea agreement. Failure to so advise the defendant amounts to deficient performance under theStricklandtest.State v. Edwards, 2007-NMCA-043, 141 N.M. 491, 157 P.3d 56, cert. quashed, 142 N.M. 436, 166 P.3d 1090.\n\nCourt cannot stay registration pending appeal.— Trial judges have neither the power nor the discretion to stay the application of the SORNA pending the outcome of an appeal.State v. Myers, 2011-NMSC-028, 150 N.M. 1, 256 P.3d 13,rev'g2010-NMCA-007, 147 N.M. 574, 226 P.3d 673.\n\nA trial court has discretion to stay Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act registration pending appeal.State v. Myers, 2010-NMCA-007, 147 N.M. 574, 226 P.3d 673,rev'd, 2011-NMSC-028, 150 N.M. 1, 256 P.3d 13.\n\nStay of registration pending appeal.— Where defendant was convicted of sexual exploitation of children by manufacturing child pornography; the diagnostic evaluation of defendant concluded that defendant is not a pedophile and that with treatment, defendant's risk of re-offending was low; defendant was required to inform the sheriff's department of defendant's current residence and work location and update the information with any changes; and the trial court released defendant pending appeal, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by staying defendant's registration as a sex offender pending the outcome of the appeal.State v. Myers, 2010-NMCA-007, 147 N.M. 574, 226 P.3d 673,rev'd, 2011-NMSC-028, 150 N.M. 1, 256 P.3d 13.\n\nNot applicable to Native Americans.— The state does not have authority to require an Indian who was convicted of a sex offense in a court other than a New Mexico state court, is an Indian living in Indian country, and is not attending school or employed outside of Indian country, to comply with the requirements of Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.State v. Atcitty, 2009-NMCA-086, 146 N.M. 781, 215 P.3d 90, cert. quashed, 2010-NMCERT-010, 149 N.M. 64, 243 P.3d 1146.\n\nInsufficient evidence that defendant willfully failed to register.— Where the defendant was released from probation on the defendant's convictions for sex offenses in 1998; the defendant registered in 2003 after the defendant received a letter informing the defendant that the defendant was required to register; the defendant registered in 2004, but failed to register after 2004; the defendant's judgment and sentence for sex offenses, which was entered before the enactment of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, did not mention any requirement that the defendant register as a sex offender; there was no evidence that when the defendant was released from probation, the defendant was informed of a duty to register as a sex offender; when the deputy sheriff validated the defendant's sex offender registry information he did not inform the defendant that the defendant had a continuing duty to register annually; there was no evidence that when the defendant registered in 2003 and 2004, the defendant was informed that he had the duty to register annually, the evidence failed to show that the defendant willfully failed to comply with the annual registration requirements.State v. Billington, 2009-NMCA-014, 145 N.M. 526, 201 P.3d 857, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-001, 145 N.M. 655, 203 P.3d 870.\n\nThe only issue raised by an appeal of a conviction for failure to register as a sex offenderis whether the defendant's failure to register was willful.State v. Burke, 2008-NMSC-052, 144 N.M. 772, 192 P.3d 767,rev'g2007-NMCA-093, 142 N.M. 218, 164 P.3d 99.\n\nThe sheriff has discretion to adopt reasonable time, place and manner restrictionson the process of registration of sex offenders.State v. Burke, 2007-NMCA-093, 142 N.M. 218, 164 P.3d 99,rev'd, 2008-NMSC-052, 144 N.M. 772, 192 P.3d 767.\n\nA protocol that restricted the time when sex offenders could registerto the hours between 1:00 and 4:00 on Wednesday afternoon was reasonable.State v. Burke, 2007-NMCA-093, 142 N.M. 218, 164 P.3d 99,rev'd, 2008-NMSC-052, 144 N.M. 772, 192 P.3d 767.\n\nNo violation of due process.— Court's failure to advise defendant, at the time of his plea, of sex offender registration consequences under New Mexico's Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act did not violate due process of law.State v. Moore, 2004-NMCA-035, 135 N.M. 210, 86 P.3d 635.\n\nMultiple convictions for failure to register violated double jeopardy.— Where defendant was convicted of third degree criminal sexual penetration, and was thereafter required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, 29-11A-1 to -10 NMSA 1978, which required that he register every ninety days and also within ten days of changing his address, and where during a certain period of time defendant was evicted and required to move out of his home which resulted in defendant missing both statutory deadlines, defendant's multiple convictions for failure to register violated his right to be free from double jeopardy, because the legislature's use of \"any\" in Subsection P indicates that it contemplated that more than one violation may occur within a given period of non-compliance before the offender next registers, and expressly stated that those violations are part of a continuing transaction or occurrence such that defendant may only be charged with one offense.State v. Cain, 2019-NMCA-059, cert. denied.\n\nAct does not constitute punishment.— Although the notification and registration provisions under Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act are immediate and automatic, they do not constitute punishment for a crime.State v. Moore, 2004-NMCA-035, 135 N.M. 210, 86 P.3d 635.\n\nRegistration and notification consequences are collateral.— Sex offender registration law consequences are collateral consequences of a plea and therefore not consequences that require a court, under the due process clause, to advise a defendant of the consequences of registration under Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.State v. Moore, 2004-NMCA-035, 135 N.M. 210, 86 P.3d 635.\n\nRole of court.— The court does not impose Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act provisions or have discretion to modify them in accepting a plea.State v. Moore, 2004-NMCA-035, 135 N.M. 210, 86 P.3d 635.\n\nWhere defendant was charged with crimes that require, on conviction, registration under SORNA and where defendant pleaded no contest to crimes that do not require registration, district court did not have the authority to include, as a condition of defendant's probation, that defendant provide the sheriff information required under SORNA and to give the sheriff the discretion to process the information under SORNA.State v. Williams, 2006-NMCA-092, 140 N.M. 194, 141 P.3d 538.\n\nEffect of vacated conviction.— Where petitioner positioned petitioner's truck across the roadway to block the path of the victim's car, entered the victim's car and raped the victim; petitioner was convicted of first-degree kidnapping and second-degree criminal sexual penetration; petitioner was required to register as a sex offender; the court of appeals vacated the rape conviction because petitioner's conviction for both first-degree kidnapping and rape would result in double punishment for the same conduct in violation of the double jeopardy clause; petitioner argued that petitioner was no longer required to register as a sex offender; the jury found petitioner guilty of both first-degree kidnapping and rape based on the same conduct; and the elements of first-degree kidnapping were supported by the elements of the rape conviction, petitioner was required to register as a sex offender.Montoya v. Driggers, 2014-NMSC-009.\n\nEffect of dismissed charges.— When a deferred sentence expires and charges are dismissed, a conviction is not eradicated under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, Chapter 29, Article 11A NMSA 1978; therefore, the defendant is still subject to the registration requirements of this section.State v. Brothers, 2002-NMCA-110, 133 N.M. 36, 59 P.3d 1268, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 30, 59 P.3d 1262.\n\nEffect of conditional discharge.— A person granted a conditional discharge under Section 31-20-13 NMSA 1978 is not required to register as a sex offender under this section.State v. Herbstman, 1999-NMCA-014, 126 N.M. 683, 974 P.2d 177.\n\nEffect of release from incarceration.— A registered sex offender is required to renew the offender's registration upon release from custody of the corrections department on unrelated charges if the offender returns to the offender's previous registered residence.State v. Parrish, 2013-NMCA-066, 304 P.3d 730, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-004.\n\nWhere defendant was a convicted sex offender and was properly registered; defendant was subsequently incarcerated in a department of corrections facility on an unrelated matter; on the day of defendant's release from the facility, defendant was given a copy of the department's notice to register form, which defendant signed and which stated that a convicted sex offender was required to register after being released from custody; and defendant returned to defendant's registered residence, defendant was required to register upon release from custody.State v. Parrish, 2013-NMCA-066, 304 P.3d 730, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-004.",

Within five days of receiving a sex offender's written notice of intent to move to another state, the county sheriff shall transmit that information to the department of public safety. Within five days of receiving that information from a county sheriff, the department shall contact the state agency responsible for registering sex offenders in the state to which the sex offender is moving. The department shall provide that state agency with registration information regarding the sex offender.
