Adv. Ltr. 2021-02.\n\nThe DNA Identification Act does not prohibit a law enforcement agency from conducting DNA searches for the purpose of establishing potential familial matches.— The DNA Identification Act (act), 29-16-1 to 29-16-13 NMSA 1978, requires any convicted felon, sex offender, or individual convicted as an adult pursuant to youthful offender or serious youthful offender proceedings under the Children's Code to provide a DNA sample to be entered into the DNA identification system (NMDIS), and, in addition, any individual over the age of eighteen is required to provide a DNA sample upon arrest for a felony. Nothing in the act specifies that a DNA search conducted for criminal investigatory purposes may only seek an exact match, or that the identification of a specific individual is the only permissible information that may be conveyed through such a search, and therefore it is likely, notwithstanding certain administrative rules, that in light of the act's purpose of facilitating the use of DNA records by law enforcement agencies in the identification, detection or exclusion of persons in connection with criminal investigations, that a court would conclude that the act does not prohibit a law enforcement agency from conducting searches for the purpose of establishing potential familial matches.DNA Identification Act(1/25/21), Att'y Gen.

The act vests the NMDIS administrative center with the administrative rulemaking authority to set specific requirements for sample collection and DNA testing, but does not specify which scientific techniques NMDIS may utilize, instead requiring that the techniques utilized be compatible with the procedures the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) has specified, including comparable test procedures, laboratory equipment, supplies and computer software, and therefore the question of whether the use of RAPID DNA analysis techniques is permissible is reserved to the NMDIS administrative center and the FBI.DNA Identification Act(1/25/21), Att'y Gen.

Const., art. II, § 10.State v. Blea, 2018-NMCA-052, cert. denied.\n\nEntry of a DNA profile generated from a deceased person into the New Mexico DNA identification system.— The DNA Identification Act (act), 29-16-1 to 29-16-13 NMSA 1978, requires any convicted felon, sex offender, or individual convicted as an adult pursuant to youthful offender or serious youthful offender proceedings under the Children's Code to provide a DNA sample to be entered into the DNA identification system (NMDIS), and, in addition, any individual over the age of eighteen is required to provide a DNA sample upon arrest for a felony, and although the act does not expressly mention deceased individuals with documented felony arrests or convictions, it is likely, in light of the act's purpose of facilitating the use of DNA records by law enforcement agencies in the identification, detection or exclusion of persons in connection with criminal investigations, that a court would conclude that the act permits the entry of a DNA profile generated from a deceased individual with a documented felony arrest or conviction into NMDIS for the purpose of comparison to evidence profiles generated from unsolved criminal cases.DNA Identification Act(1/25/21), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2021-02.\n\nThe DNA Identification Act does not prohibit a law enforcement agency from conducting DNA searches for the purpose of establishing potential familial matches.— The DNA Identification Act (act), 29-16-1 to 29-16-13 NMSA 1978, requires any convicted felon, sex offender, or individual convicted as an adult pursuant to youthful offender or serious youthful offender proceedings under the Children's Code to provide a DNA sample to be entered into the DNA identification system (NMDIS), and, in addition, any individual over the age of eighteen is required to provide a DNA sample upon arrest for a felony. Nothing in the act specifies that a DNA search conducted for criminal investigatory purposes may only seek an exact match, or that the identification of a specific individual is the only permissible information that may be conveyed through such a search, and therefore it is likely, notwithstanding certain administrative rules, that in light of the act's purpose of facilitating the use of DNA records by law enforcement agencies in the identification, detection or exclusion of persons in connection with criminal investigations, that a court would conclude that the act does not prohibit a law enforcement agency from conducting searches for the purpose of establishing potential familial matches.DNA Identification Act(1/25/21), Att'y Gen.
