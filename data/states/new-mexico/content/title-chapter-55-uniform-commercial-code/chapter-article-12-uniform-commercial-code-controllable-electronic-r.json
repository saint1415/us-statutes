      "text": "(a) As used in Chapter 55, Article 12 NMSA 1978:\n\n(1) \"controllable electronic record\" means a record stored in an electronic medium that can be subjected to control pursuant to Section 55-12-105 NMSA 1978. The term does not include a controllable account, a controllable payment intangible, a deposit account, an electronic copy of a record evidencing chattel paper, an electronic document of title, electronic money, investment property or a transferable record;\n\n(2) \"qualifying purchaser\" means a purchaser of a controllable electronic record or an interest in a controllable electronic record that obtains control of the controllable electronic record for value, in good faith, and without notice of a claim of a property right in the controllable electronic record;\n\n(3) \"transferable record\" has the meaning provided for that term in:\n\n(A) Section 201(a)(1) of the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 7021(a)(1), as amended; or\n\n(B) Subsection (a) of Section 14-16-16 NMSA 1978; and\n\n(4) \"value\" has the meaning provided in Subsection (a) of Section 55-3-303 NMSA 1978 as if references in that subsection to an \"instrument\" were references to a controllable account, controllable electronic record or controllable payment intangible.\n\n(b) The definitions in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code of \"account debtor\", \"controllable account\", \"controllable payment intangible\", \"chattel paper\", \"deposit account\", \"electronic money\" and \"investment property\" apply to Sections 55-12-101 through 55-12-106 NMSA 1978.\n\n(c) Article 1 of the Uniform Commercial Code contains general definitions and principles of construction and interpretation applicable throughout Sections 55-12-101 through 55-12-106 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 55-12-102, enacted by Laws 2023, ch. 142, § 97.\n\nOFFICIAL COMMENTS\n\nUCC Official Comments by ALI & the NCCUSL. Reproduced with permission of the PEB for the UCC. All rights reserved.\n\n1.Source.Subsection (a)(2), defining \"qualifying purchaser,\" derives from Section 3-302(a)(2), which defines \"holder in due course\" of a negotiable instrument.\n\n2.\"Controllable electronic record.\"To be a \"controllable electronic record\" (CER) within the scope of Article 12, an electronic record must be susceptible of control under Section 12-105. Unlike \"transferable records\" under the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN) or a \"transferable record\" under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), a record can be a CER under Article 12 in the absence of an agreement to that effect.\n\nThis definition uses the term \"record,\" defined in Section 1-201 to include \"information . . . that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form.\" The term \"electronic\" also is defined in Section 1-201. These broad definitions of \"record\" and \"electronic\" necessarily produce an expansive meaning of \"electronic record.\" An electronic record would include, for example, music stored on compact disks, email messages, digital photos, personal and other information stored on a social media platform, and all types of databases stored on in an electronic medium. But most of these electronic records typically would not fall within the definition of a CER in Subsection (a)(1), which includes only those electronic records \"that can be subjected to control under Section 12-105.\" See generally Prefatory Note 2.\n\nConsider, for example, a so-called \"page\" on a social media platform. Generalizations about social media/social networking platforms are difficult and these systems no doubt will continue to evolve. But these platforms typically involve licensing arrangements with users that do not permit the users (or anyone) to acquire the exclusive powers contemplated by the definition of \"control\" in Section 12-105. Consequently, these electronic records are not controllable electronic records as defined.\n\nThe provisions of Article 12 also do not apply to certain specified types of electronic records, and the definition has been limited accordingly. For example, the definition does not include a \"transferable record\" under E-SIGN or UETA. It also does not include \"investment property,\" as defined in Section 9-102(a)(49). For this reason, the rights of an entitlement holder in a controllable electronic record that is a financial asset with respect to which the entitlement holder has a security entitlement are excluded from the definition (although the entitlement holder's securities intermediary may hold directly an interest in a controllable electronic record that it has credited to a securities account). See Sections 8-102(a)(9) (defining \"financial asset\"), (a)(14) (defining \"securities intermediary\"), (a)(17) (defining \"security entitlement\"), and Comment 9; 9-102(a)(49) (defining \"investment property\"). See also Section 8-103(h), clarifying that a controllable electronic record is not a \"financial asset\" except pursuant to Section 8-102(a)(9)(iii).\n\nA controllable electronic record is not itself a \"security,\" defined in part in Section 8-102(a)(15) as \"an obligation of an issuer or a share, participation, or other interest in an issuer or in property or an enterprise of an issuer.\" It also is not \"a share or similar equity interest,\" an \"investment company security,\" or \"an interest in a partnership or limited liability company.\" See Section 8-103(a), (b), and (c). For a discussion of the roles that controllable electronic records may play in transactions involving uncertificated securities, see Section 8-102, Comment 18.\n\n3.\"Qualifying purchaser.\"The conditions for becoming a qualifying purchaser were drawn from Article 3. More specifically, the conditions for becoming a qualifying purchaser were drawn from Section 3-302(a)(2), which defines \"holder in due course\" of a negotiable instrument. Among these conditions is that a person take the instrument \"for value.\"SeeSubsection (a)(4) (defining \"value\") and Comment 5. To meet the requirements for a qualifying purchaser under Subsection (a)(2) there must be a time at which all of the requirements are satisfied. For example, if a purchaser obtains notice of a claim of a property right before giving value or satisfying the requirements for control, the purchaser cannot be a qualifying purchaser.\n\nUnder Section 12-104(a), not only a purchaser of a controllable electronic record but also a purchaser of a controllable account or controllable payment intangible may be a qualifying purchaser. Moreover, a purchaser of a controllable account or a controllable payment intangible may be a qualifying purchaser even if the purchaser does not also purchase the controllable electronic record that evidences the account or payment intangible. For example, a secured party having a security interest in all of a debtor's accounts and payment intangibles would be a purchaser of those rights to payment, which would include the debtor's controllable accounts and payment intangibles. If the secured party were to obtain control of the debtor's controllable account or payment intangible, it would become a qualifying purchaser if it also met the other conditions for that status. However, to obtain control of the controllable account or controllable payment intangible, a requirement for qualifying purchaser status, the purchaser must obtain control of the controllable electronic record evidencing the controllable account or controllable payment intangible. Section 12-104(b); see also Section 9-107A. A person need not be a purchaser, however, to obtain control of a controllable electronic record.\n\n4.\"Transferable record.\"This definition facilitates the exclusion of transferable records from the definition of controllable electronic record.\n\n5.\"Value.\"This definition adopts the concept of value in Section 3-303, which is narrower than the generally applicable concept in Section 1-204. Comment 10 to Section 12-104 explains the difference between the two concepts.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2023, ch. 142, § 112 made Laws 2023, ch. 142, § 97 effective January 1, 2024.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 2023, ch. 142, § 97 enacted a new 55-12-102 NMSA 1978, effective January 1, 2024.

Reproduced with permission of the PEB for the UCC. All rights reserved.\n\n1.Source.Subsection (d) derives from Section 2-403(1) (concerning the rights of a purchaser).\n\nSubsection (e) derives from Sections 3-306 (concerning the rights of a holder in due course of an instrument) and 8-303 (concerning rights of a protected purchaser of a security).\n\nSubsection (g) derives from Section 8-502 (protecting entitlement holders).\n\nSubsection (h) derives from Section 9-331(c) (filing under Article 9 does not provide notice for purposes of protections of purchasers under other articles).\n\n2.Applicability of section to controllable accounts and controllable payment intangibles.Under Subsection (a), the provisions of this section apply to controllable accounts and controllable payment intangibles in the same manner that they apply to controllable electronic records. For example, a qualifying purchaser of a controllable account that obtains control of the controllable electronic record that evidences the account (and who thereby obtains control of the account under Subsection (b) and Section 9-107A) would take the account free of conflicting claims of a property right in the account under Subsection (e). Under Subsection (b), for purposes of determining whether a purchaser of a controllable account or controllable payment intangible obtains control, the purchaser obtains control by obtaining control of the controllable electronic record that evidences the account or payment intangible. Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, references to a controllable electronic record in the official comments in this Article also refer to a controllable account or controllable payment intangible.\n\n3.Applicability of other law.As a general matter, Subsection (c) leaves to other law the resolution of questions concerning the transfer of rights in a controllable electronic record, such as the acts that must be taken to effectuate a transfer of rights and the scope of the rights that a transferee acquires. Subsections (d) through (h) contain important exceptions to Subsection (c).\n\nExample 1:A creates a controllable electronic record. Although the system in which the electronic record is recorded may determine how the electronic record can be used and control may be transferred, other law would determine what rights A has in the controllable electronic record. If, for example, A created the electronic record in the scope of its employment, A's rights would be subject to the terms of A's employment contract.\n\nA and B agree to the sale of the controllable electronic record to B. Other law would determine what steps need to be taken for B to acquire rights in the controllable electronic record. Once B acquires those rights under other law, B would be a purchaser (as defined in Section 1-201), whose rights also would be determined by Subsection (d) (i.e., the shelter principle, discussed below in Comment 4). However, even if B did not acquire rights under other law, if B met the requirements for a qualifying purchaser, its rights would be determined by Subsections (e) and (g).SeeComments 7 and 8, below.\n\nThe \"law other than this article\" that may apply to the transfer of rights in a controllable electronic record under Subsection (c) includes UCC Article 9. Section 9-203 would apply, for example, to determine whether a purported secured party acquired an enforceable security interest in a controllable electronic record.\n\n4.Purchaser and transferor under Subsection (d): shelter principle and resulting controllable electronic records.Subsection (d) sets forth the familiar \"shelter\" principle, under which a purchaser of a controllable electronic record acquires whatever rights the transferor had or had power to transfer. However, in some cases the controllable electronic record that is acquired by the purchaser will not be the \"same\" controllable electronic record that was transferred by the transferor. Such a transfer might involve the elimination of a \"transferred\" controllable electronic record and the resulting and corresponding derivative creation and acquisition of a new controllable electronic record. An example of such a resulting controllable electronic record is the unspent transaction output (UTXO) generated by a transaction in bitcoin. The Bitcoin protocol operates by allowing users to \"spend\" their UTXOs to create one or more new UTXOs for the same amount of bitcoin, so each transfer produces new UTXOs controlled by the transferees (one of which may be the transferor—spender—of the bitcoin). Subsection (d) should be construed broadly to encompass such transfers and resulting derivative controllable electronic records acquired by a purchaser. Because Subsection (d) addresses the rights of a purchaser in the \"purchased\" asset and not the \"transferred\" asset, this construction is wholly consistent with the statutory text.\n\nNotwithstanding the broad Subsection (d) shelter principle, which provides that a purchaser acquires \"all rights\" of the transferor, those rights are subject to the reach of Section 1-304. Under that section a contract or duty under the UCC imposes an overarching \"obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement.\" Section 1-304. In this context, \"performance and enforcement\" include the exercise of rights under the UCC, such as the rights conferred on a purchaser by the Subsection (d) shelter principle.SeeSection 1-304, Comment 2. For example, consider a qualifying purchaser of a controllable electronic record, controllable account, or controllable payment intangible who then sells that asset to a person who is not a qualifying purchaser. If the second purchaser had previously engaged in fraudulent or illegal activity in connection with the purchased asset or an asset to which the purchased asset is attributable, the purchaser's exercise of rights under Subsection (d) as to the purchased asset may be in breach of its obligation of good faith. Section 3-203(b) states this result directly with respect to a transferee of a negotiable instrument if the transferee previously engaged in fraud or illegality with respect to the same instrument. Section 3-203(b). The same result would apply under Subsection (d). Subsection (d) relies on the application of the general obligation of good faith under Section 1-304 to reach the appropriate result. However, unlike negotiable instruments, many controllable electronic records are fungible. For this reason, in some cases it might not be possible to establish that an acquired controllable electronic record has a sufficient nexus with a transferee's earlier fraud or illegality.\n\n5.Nonpurchaser having control.Under Section 12-105, a person may have control of a controllable electronic record even if the person has no property interest in the controllable electronic record. A person that has control of, but no property interest in, a controllable electronic record would not be a purchaser of the controllable electronic record and so would not be eligible to be a qualifying purchaser under this section.\n\nExample 2:Debtor granted to Secured Party a security interest in all Debtor's existing and after-acquired accounts, chattel paper, and payment intangibles. Secured Party perfected its security interest in a specific controllable account by obtaining control of the controllable electronic record that evidences the controllable account. See Section 9-107A.\n\nBecause Debtor's security agreement does not cover controllable electronic records, Secured Party would have no interest in the controllable electronic record. Accordingly, Secured Party would not be a purchaser of the controllable electronic record. However, as a purchaser of the controllable accounts and controllable payment intangibles, Secured Party could benefit from the take-free rule in Subsection (e) (discussed in Comment 7).\n\n6.Distinction between controllable electronic record and controllable account or controllable payment intangible evidenced by the controllable electronic record.Even though a controllable electronic record evidences a controllable account or controllable payment intangible, the controllable electronic record is distinct from the account or payment intangible that it evidences. The account or payment intangible is connected with (or \"tethered\" to) the electronic record by virtue of the relevant account debtor's obligation to pay the person in control of the controllable electronic record. Moreover, control of the controllable account or payment intangible is achieved only by obtaining control of the controllable electronic record that evidences the account or payment intangible. Example 2 explains that a purchaser may obtain a property interest in the controllable account or controllable payment intangible even if it does not acquire any interest in the controllable electronic record that evidences the account or payment intangible. (On the other hand, merely obtaining control of a controllable electronic record does not result in the acquisition of an interest in the record.) This approach is intended to avoid a trap for the unwary purchaser that obtains an interest in the account or payment intangible (which is the asset that has stand-alone value) but might fail to acquire an interest in the related controllable electronic record. However, good practice may encourage a purchaser to acquire an interest in the controllable electronic record as well, which would eliminate any potential confusion.\n\n7.The take-free rule.Subsection (e) makes controllable electronic records and, under Subsection (a), controllable accounts and controllable payment intangibles, highly negotiable. Subsection (e) derives from Section 3-306, under which a holder in due course takes a negotiable instrument free of a claim of a property right in the instrument. A qualifying purchaser of a controllable electronic record, controllable account, or controllable payment intangible takes free of all claims of a property right in the purchased controllable electronic record, account, or payment intangible.\n\nExample 3:Hacker, a thief, \"steals\" and obtains control of a controllable electronic record. Hacker then sells the controllable electronic record to Buyer, who obtains control and otherwise meets the requirements for a qualifying purchaser (by obtaining control and purchasing for value, in good faith, and without notice of a claim of a property right).\n\nAs a general matter, law other than Article 12 would determine whether any particular transaction creates a property interest in a controllable electronic record. Section 12-104(c). However, even if under other applicable law Hacker has no rights in, and no right to transfer, the \"stolen\" controllable electronic record, Subsection (e) enables Buyer, a qualifying purchaser, to take the controllable electronic record (or any purchased controllable account or controllable payment intangible evidenced by the controllable electronic record) free of claims of a property right—including that of the rightful owner.\n\nAs Example 3 illustrates, a person in control of a controllable electronic record, such as Hacker, has the power, even if not the right, to transfer rights in the record to a qualifying purchaser. Of course, if the qualifying purchaser is a secured party whose security interest secures an obligation, the purchaser would take free of the conflicting property right only to the extent of the obligation secured. See Section 12-104(d) (purchaser of a limited interest); cf. Section 3-302(e). Moreover, even if a secured party were not a qualifying purchaser of a controllable electronic record, controllable account, or controllable payment intangible, its security interest in the collateral over which it obtained control would, however, have priority over a conflicting security interest that was perfected by a method other than control. Section 9-326A.\n\n8.Subsection (g)—the \"no-action\" rule.Subsection (g) applies in the situation (explained in Comment 4) in which the \"resulting\" controllable electronic record (or controllable account or controllable payment intangible) purchased by a qualifying purchaser is not the \"same\" record, account, or payment intangible that was transferred. In such a situation, a person claiming a property right in the transferred asset may assert a claim against a purchaser of the \"resulting\" asset even though the claimant is not asserting a claim of a property right in the purchased asset. If the claim is based on both the purchaser's purchase of the acquired asset and the claimant's claim of a property right in the transferred asset, Subsection (g) protects the qualifying purchaser from liability to the claimant based on any theory. The qualifying purchaser's protection from the assertion of such a claim does not depend on any proof that the purchased asset is somehow \"traceable\" to the transferred asset.\n\nIf instead, such a claimant were to assert a claim based on a property right in the purchased asset, then the qualifying purchaser would take free of that claim under Subsection (e). Subsection (e) applies whether or not the acquired asset is the same asset that was transferred.\n\n9.\"Tethered\" assets.Certain controllable electronic records may carry with them rights to other assets, for example, goods or rights to payment. By its terms, the take-free rule in Subsection (e) applies to controllable electronic records (and, under Subsection (a), controllable accounts and controllable payment intangibles evidenced by a controllable electronic record). One might argue that the inclusion of controllable accounts and controllable payment intangibles in the scope of Subsection (e) is unnecessary. By taking a controllable electronic record free of property claims, the argument would be that a person takes not only the controllable electronic record itself but also all rights that are \"carried\" in the controllable electronic record free and clear.\n\nSubsection (f) defeats that argument. It limits the application of the take-free rule in Subsection (e) to controllable electronic records and, through the application of Subsection (a), controllable accounts and controllable payment intangibles evidenced by a controllable electronic record. Under Subsection (f), except as provided in Subsections (a) and (e), a qualifying purchaser takes rights to payment (other than controllable accounts and controllable payment intangibles), rights to performance, and interests in property that are evidenced by a controllable electronic record subject to third-party property claims, unless law other than Article 12 provides to the contrary. The reference in Subsection (f) to \"law other than this article\" contemplates that another article of the UCC might provide a contrary rule for some types of property that might be tethered to a controllable electronic record.\n\nThe treatment of controllable accounts and controllable payment intangibles in Articles 9 and 12 is feasible because Article 9 already provides the legal framework for assignments of accounts and payment intangibles. In addition, because accounts and payment intangibles are rights to payment of monetary obligations, tethering of an account or payment intangible to a controllable electronic record is straightforward. The account debtor is obligated to pay the person that has control of the relevant controllable electronic record (subject to the qualifications imposed by Section 12-106).\n\n10.Creating the functional equivalent of a negotiable instrument.Two defining characteristics of an Article 3 negotiable instrument are that a holder in due course (i) takes free of claims of a property or possessory right to the instrument (Section 3-306) and (ii) takes free of most defenses and claims in recoupment (Section 3-305). Article 3 applies only to written instruments. Article 12 and the revisions to Article 9 provide a method for reaching a similar result with respect to controllable accounts and controllable payment intangibles.\n\nAs regards the first characteristic, a qualifying purchaser could acquire the controllable account or controllable payment intangible free of any claim of a property interest. As regards the second characteristic, the definition of \"qualifying purchaser\" omits some of the conditions for becoming a holder in due course. For example, to qualify as a holder in due course, a holder must take \"without notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment . . . .\" Section 3-302(a)(2)(vi). A controllable electronic record is information; there are no parties to a controllable electronic record. However, there are parties to a controllable account or controllable payment intangible. Accordingly, Sections 9-404 and 9-403 would determine whether a purchaser of the controllable account or controllable payment intangible takes free of a defense. Section 9-403 ordinarily would give effect to the account debtor's agreement not to assert claims or defenses.\n\nSection 9-403 adopts the meaning of value in Section 3-303, as does Article 12. The concept of value in Section 3-303 is narrower than the concept in Section 1-204, which applies generally to UCC transactions. Under Section 1-204, a person gives value for rights if the person acquires them in return for a promise. However, under Section 3-303, if a negotiable instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance, the instrument is transferred for value only to the extent that the promise has been performed.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2023, ch. 142, § 112 made Laws 2023, ch. 142, § 99 effective January 1, 2024.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 2023, ch. 142, § 99 enacted a new 55-12-104 NMSA 1978, effective January 1, 2024.

Reproduced with permission of the PEB for the UCC. All rights reserved.\n\n1.Source.These provisions derive from Section 3-602, which governs the discharge of a person obligated on a negotiable instrument, and Section 9-406(a), (b) and (c), which governs the discharge of an account debtor, including a person obligated on an account or payment intangible.\n\n2.The basic rules.This section applies only to an account debtor that has undertaken to pay the person that has control of the controllable electronic record that evidences the obligation to pay.SeeSection 9-102 (defining \"controllable account\" and \"controllable payment intangible\"). Section 9-406 would continue to apply in other respects and to all other account debtors. As to the relationship between this section and Section 9-406,seeComment 5.\n\nUnder Subsection (a)(1), an account debtor may discharge its obligation on the controllable account or controllable payment intangible by paying the person that has control of the related controllable electronic record at the time of payment. Subsections (a)(2) and (b) would remove from an account debtor the burden of determining who has control of the related controllable electronic record at any given time—a burden that, with respect to some controllable electronic records, an account debtor may be unable to satisfy. Under Subsection (a)(2), subject to Subsection (b), an account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying a person that formerly had control of the related controllable electronic record, which presumably would include the initial obligee.\n\nSubsection (b) reflects the fact that a person to which control has been transferred may not wish to take the risk that the account debtor will discharge its obligation by paying the transferor. Subsection (b) protects the transferee by providing that, if the account debtor receives an effective notification that control has been transferred, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying in accordance with the notification and may not discharge its obligation by paying a person that formerly had control. The notification must be signed by a person formerly having control or by the transferee.\n\nTo be effective under Subsection (b), a notification must reasonably identify the controllable account or controllable payment intangible, notify the account debtor that control of the controllable electronic record that evidences the controllable account or controllable payment intangible was transferred, identify the transferee in any reasonable way, and provide a commercially reasonable method by which the account debtor is to make payments to the transferee. A change in the identity of the person to which the account debtor must make payment should not, and typically will not, impose a significant burden on the account debtor. However, one can imagine a method of making payment that would be burdensome, for example, making a payment through a trading platform or payment service with which the account debtor does not have an account. For this reason, the designated method of making payment must be \"commercially reasonable.\"\n\n3.\"Reasonable proof.\"As noted above, this section derives in large part from Section 9-406, which provides for notification that an account or payment intangible has been assigned. Experience suggests that account debtors that have received notification of an assignment under Section 9-406 typically make payments in accordance with the notice. Recognizing that an account debtor may be uncertain whether a notification is legitimate, Section 9-406 affords to an account debtor the right to request proof that the account or payment intangible was assigned. See generally, Section 9-406, Comment 4.\n\nSubsection (e) contains a similar provision. On the account debtor's request, the person giving the notification must seasonably furnish reasonable proof that control of the controllable electronic record has been transferred. If the person does not comply with the request, the account debtor may ignore the notification and discharge its obligation by paying a person formerly in control.\n\n\"Reasonable proof\" requires evidence that would be understood by a typical account debtor to whom it is proffered as demonstrating to a reasonably high probability that control of the controllable electronic record has been transferred to the transferee. Subsection (f) provides a safe harbor for providing reasonable proof. It enables a person to satisfy the account debtor's request by demonstrating that the transferee has the power to avail itself of substantially all the benefit from the controllable electronic record, to prevent others from availing themselves of substantially all the benefit from the controllable electronic record, and to transfer these powers to another person. This demonstration would not necessarily prove that a person actually has control of a controllable electronic record because it need not show that the transferee held the last two powers exclusively. Nevertheless, such a demonstration would constitute \"reasonable proof\" under subsection (f). A person that has control should have little difficulty providing this proof, as a person cannot have control unless it can readily identify itself as having the requisite powers.SeeSection 12-105(a)(2). Reasonable proof that is seasonably furnished by a person other than the person that gave the notification would constitute compliance with the account debtor's request.\n\nSubsection (e) requires that reasonable proof be provided \"using the agreed method.\" Subsection (f) requires that a person use \"the agreed method\" to demonstrate that the transferee has the specified powers. \"Agreed method\" refers to the commercially reasonable method to which the parties agreed, in a signed record, before the notification was sent. If parties did not so agree, the notification is ineffective under subsection (d)(1).\n\nAn account debtor may agree to participate in a system providing for the control of controllable accounts or controllable payment intangibles. If the system is programmed to provide for notification to the account debtor upon the transfer of control, the account debtor's agreement and the operation of the system may satisfy the requirements of Subsections (d)(1), (e), and (f).\n\n4.Additional considerations for account debtors.The requirement in Subsection (e) that reasonable proof be furnished using the \"agreed method\" provides considerable protection for account debtors upon receipt of a notification of assignment and making a request for proof. There are, however, other considerations that are of importance to account debtors but are beyond the scope of the frameworks provided by Articles 9 and 12. One such consideration is the potential involvement of pseudonymous payees, which may raise issues such as compliance with anti-money laundering regulations and sanctions compliance. These are examples of issues that a well-structured program for controllable accounts and controllable payment intangibles might address.\n\n5.Relationship to Section 9-406.Section 9-406 governs the discharge of the obligation of an account debtor. Section 9-406 carves out of its scope transactions to the extent covered by this section.SeeSection 9-406(l).\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2023, ch. 142, § 112 made Laws 2023, ch. 142, § 101 effective January 1, 2024.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 2023, ch. 142, § 101 enacted a new 55-12-106 NMSA 1978, effective January 1, 2024.

The \"matters covered by\" this Article are relatively narrow and discrete, albeit enormously important. If the choice-of-law rule provided by this section points to a jurisdiction that has adopted Article 12, those matters would include the interpretation and application of Article 12, including its definitions. In general, issues that would be determined by the provisions of this Article are to be determined under the law that is applicable as determined by this section. These include the rights of purchasers and property claimants more generally with respect to controllable electronic records, controllable accounts, and controllable payment intangibles to the extent dealt with by this Article—issues addressed by Section 12-104. The rights and obligations of account debtors, to the extent dealt with by Section 12-106, are also matters covered. Matters not covered by this Article, including matters as to which this Article expressly provides are covered by other law, are not within the scope of this section.\n\n3.Practical considerations on determination of governing law.This section relating to the law governing the matters covered by this Article must confront substantial practical considerations. These considerations arise primarily from two factors. First, as described below, this section relies primarily on a \"waterfall\" of alternatives for determining a controllable electronic record's jurisdiction. The first four elements of the waterfall require for their applicability express provisions of a controllable electronic record, an attached or logically associated record, or the system in which a controllable electronic record is recorded. However, many controllable electronic records and systems existing at the time of the 2022 Amendments do not contain these provisions. As explained in Comment 6, the expectation is that over time electronic records and related systems will adopt these provisions in reliance on this section, thereby satisfying at least one of the first four elements of the waterfall. Second, in the absence of these provisions, at the bottom of the waterfall the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction is the District of Columbia. See Comment 6.\n\n4.Governing law for Section 12-106.Subsection (b) provides an exception to the general rule of Subsection (a) that \"the local law of a controllable electronic record's jurisdiction governs the matters covered by this Article.\" The exception recognizes that an account debtor's rights and duties generally are governed by the law applicable to the underlying obligation of the account debtor, and not by the law applicable to the agreement between the assignor (debtor) and the assignee (secured party)—a security agreement.SeeSection 9-401, Comment 3. Subsection (b) recognizes that an effective agreement (i.e., one effective under Section 1-301(a)) between the account debtor and assignor may choose a different law to cover the matters covered by Section 12-106 (i.e., the account debtor's rights and duties addressed in that section). Such an agreement may, of course, address matters other than those covered by Section 12-106 (for example, an agreement that all obligations of the account debtor are governed by the laws of State X).\n\n5.Determination of controllable electronic record's jurisdiction.The basic rule that the law of a controllable electronic record's jurisdiction governs the matters covered by Article 12 may be viewed as a rough proxy for the traditional role of the location of tangible asset (e.g., goods) in determining the applicable law (lex rei sitae). Drawing on the analogous provisions in Sections 8-110 and 9-305 in the context of a security entitlement or securities account or a commodity contract or commodity account, under Subsection (c) it is the controllable electronic record itself, records attached thereto or associated therewith, or the system in which the controllable electronic record is recorded that determines the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction and, thereby, the governing law. Subsection (c) provides a \"waterfall\" of rules based on provisions that identify a particular jurisdiction as the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction or alternatively that provide the governing law for a controllable electronic record or the system in which the record is recorded. As to Subsection (e),seeSection 8-110, Comment 5A.\n\nParagraphs (1) through (4) of the Subsection (c) waterfall each relies on information available from a controllable electronic record, an attached or logically associated record, or rules of a system in which the record is recorded. A controllable electronic record's jurisdiction is determined by one of these sources that \"expressly provide[s]\" that a jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction or that a particular jurisdiction's law is the governing law. These paragraphs refer to attached or logically associated records or system rules that are \"readily available.\" They also assume that the controllable electronic record is itself readily available to anyone choosing to deal with the record. These provisions are based on the assumption that the relevant express provision will be available to an interested person without the imposition of unreasonable burdens.\n\n6.Bottom of the waterfall: District of Columbia.Many controllable electronic records, attached or logically associated records, and systems in which controllable electronic records are recorded that exist at the time of the 2022 Amendments do not identify the \"controllable electronic record's jurisdiction\" or the governing law (some permissioned systems being exceptions). (It is anticipated that, upon widespread adoption of Article 12 and accompanying amendments, systems will adapt and the first four elements of the waterfall will become more generally applicable for identifying a controllable electronic record's jurisdiction.) Consequently, Subsection (c)(5) addresses an issue that does not normally exist in the context of Sections 8-110 and 9-305. It might be thought that the logical choice for the residual rule for designating the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction at bottom of the waterfall would be, the location of the debtor. That approach would follow the role of the location of a debtor under Sections 9-301 and 9-307. However, that location may not readily be determined by parties to a transaction, primarily because in many cases involving controllable electronic records the transferor is not known to or easily discoverable by a purchaser. See Prefatory Note 1 to Article 12. Consequently, Subsection (c)(5) resolves this issue by providing that the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction is the District of Columbia.\n\n7.District of Columbia as controllable electronic record's jurisdiction.The designation of the District of Columbia as the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction follows Section 9-307(c), which designates the District of Columbia as the location of a debtor that otherwise would be located in a jurisdiction whose law does not provide for a generally applicable system of public notice (such a filing or registration) for nonpossessory security interests. This designation also assumes that the District of Columbia will have adopted Article 12 and the conforming amendments to Articles 1 and 9 in substantially the uniform version—i.e., without material modification of the official text. This is a plausible assumption based on the history of adoptions in that jurisdiction. Because the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction does not govern perfection of a security interest by filing, the designation of the District of Columbia at the bottom of the waterfall will not confer on that jurisdiction any economic benefits of fees for filing of financing statements. See Section 9-306B(b). Subsection (d) addresses the unlikely situation that the District of Columbia does not adopt Article 12 without material modification of the official text or later adopts materially non-uniform amendments. Subsection (d) is patterned loosely (but as closely as feasible) on the TRADES Regulations, 31 CFR § 357.11(e), for U.S. Treasury securities.\n\nThe term \"Article 12\" is defined in Subsection (d) as the officially promulgated 2022 version of Article 12 and conforming amendments. In determining whether the District of Columbia has enacted Article 12 without material modification, a court or other tribunal should consider the materiality of any provision in the context of the issue or issues before it. A modification of a provision that would be material in another context should be disregarded if it has no bearing on the issue or issues before the tribunal. In connection with any future revision of the Article 12 official text, it will be important for transitional provisions to address the situations in which the District of Columbia may or may not have adopted the revised official text.\n\n8.Relevant time for determination of governing law.Subsection (f) provides that the rights of purchasers are governed by the applicable law as of the time of purchase. Note that Sections 8-110 and 9-305 do not contain an analogous rule with respect to a securities intermediary's jurisdiction. However, Section 8-110(c) does provide a similar rule for the delivery of a security certificate and adverse claims. As to the timing of the determination of the governing law for other issues under Article 12, such as the rights and duties of account debtors under Section 12-106, the section does not specify a time. As with most statutory provisions relating to governing law, courts are free to determine the appropriate relevant time taking into account the relevant facts and the nature of the issues involved.\n\nEffective dates.— Laws 2023, ch. 142, § 112 made Laws 2023, ch. 142, § 102 effective January 1, 2024.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 2023, ch. 142, § 102 enacted a new 55-12-107 NMSA 1978, effective January 1, 2024.
