No land shall be condemned for the production of sand, gravel, caliche or rock that is in the possession or ownership of a person, firm or corporation engaged at the time the proceeding is brought in the actual production of such material from such land sought to be condemned. Nor shall any land be condemned for municipal purposes that may be shown by the owner or lessee to have a content of precious metal sufficient to produce the mineral in paying quantities.\n\nC. Unless the petition to condemn specifically provides for a transfer of less than the fee, all real property acquired pursuant to this section shall be acquired and held in fee simple absolute.\n\nHistory:Laws 1981, ch. 125, § 33; 1997, ch. 228, § 3.\n\nCross references.— For eminent domain by state institutions,see42A-3-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor condemnation of waterway for street improvements,see42A-3-3 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor general powers of municipalities,see3-18-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor power of eminent domain by municipality,see3-18-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor municipal housing,see3-45-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor drainage for counties,see72-4-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor condemnation by conservancy districts,see73-14-42 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor conservancy districts obtaining possession of land during pendency of condemnation proceeding,see73-15-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective April 11, 1997, added Paragraph A(8) and redesignated the remaining paragraphs accordingly.\n\nSection not authority for condemnation of existing utility.— Although subsection A(7) permits condemnation for \"electric lines\", since the word \"property\" as used in this section appears to mean only real property and not existing lines, poles, etc., this section is not statutory authority for a municipality to condemn an existing public electric utility.City of Las Cruces v. El Paso Elec. Co., 904 F. Supp. 1238 (D.N.M. 1995).\n\nIn condemnation proceeding, description of property must conform to statutory requirement.City of Santa Fe v. Lamy, 1930-NMSC-026, 34 N.M. 583, 286 P. 422.\n\nState transportation commission must pay for use of park lands.— The state highway commission (now state transportation commission) is not authorized to acquire either private property, or public property held in a proprietary capacity other than by purchase or condemnation, and must pay for park land it uses for highway purposes.State ex rel.

Raton Ice Co., 1920-NMSC-060, 26 N.M. 300, 191 P. 516.\n\nNo condemnation for acequias.— No express power is conferred upon a city to condemn property already devoted to a public use in either of these sections for any purpose, and the legislature did not intend by implication to confer power upon cities to condemn acequias used to conduct water for irrigation purposes.City of Albuquerque v. Garcia,1913-NMSC-006, 17 N.M. 445, 130 P. 118.\n\nError to appraise property, when caliche present, by average value.— This statute does not prevent the condemnation, for road-building purposes, of rock, sand, gravel and caliche, since none of them are metals, but as caliche has value, when processed, as a stock food, the proprietor should be given opportunity to prove special value, and it is error to appraise the property by its average value alone.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Good, 1940-NMSC-056, 44 N.M. 495, 105 P.2d 470.\n\nUnited States joined as defendant when Indian lands sought for acquisition.— The United States must be joined as a defendant when Pueblo Indian lands are sought for acquisition, and the United States district court is a proper forum and has the jurisdiction to try and determine the respective rights of the petitioner, the state highway commission (now state transportation commission), and the defendants, the United States and the Pueblo of Laguna.N.M. ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. United States, 148 F. Supp. 508 (D.N.M. 1957).\n\nNo taking of land already devoted to equivalent public purpose.— Generally, the authority to condemn property for public use or convenience does not, by necessary implication, provide for the taking of land already devoted to equivalent public purposes. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-329.\n\nExercise of power by bringing proceedings against state-held property.— The power of eminent domain may well be exercised by the bringing of condemnation proceedings against property held by the state under tax deeds, naming as parties defendant those persons having the right of redemption or repurchase. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-57.\n\nCounty commission may condemn real property to build courthouse on it.1967 Op. Att'y Gen.
