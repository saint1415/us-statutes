The trial de novo is not the beginning of a new action, but a continuation of the proceeding from the time of the filing of the original petition in condemnation.Transwestern Pipe Line Co. v.

In all other cases, the court shall render final judgment upon decision of all contested questions of law and fact.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 42A-1-21, enacted by Laws 1981, ch. 125, § 17.\n\nJury trial.— Based upon the language of Section 42A-1-21 NMSA 1978 and the statute's history, the legislature intended to provide for a jury trial on the issues of public use and necessity.Santa Fe S. Ry. v. Baucis Ltd. Liab. Co., 1998-NMCA-002, 124 N.M. 430, 952 P.2d 31.\n\nLegislative intent.— It was not the intention of the territorial legislature to provide for an appeal under the eminent domain statutes, in the sense that it should be a different cause.State ex rel.

For the purposes of assessing compensation and damages, the right thereto shall be deemed to have accrued as of the date the petition is filed, and actual value on that date shall be the measure of compensation for all property taken, and also the basis of damages for property not taken but injuriously affected in cases where such damages are legally recoverable; the amount of the award shall be determined from the evidence and not be limited to any amount alleged in the petition or set forth in the answer.\n\nB. Whenever just compensation shall be ascertained and awarded in such proceeding and established by judgment, the judgment shall include as a part of the just compensation awarded interest at the rate of ten percent a year upon the unpaid portion of the compensation awarded from the date the petition is filed to the date of payment or the date when the proceedings are finally abandoned. The judgment shall not include interest upon the amount represented by funds deposited by the condemnor pursuant to the provisions of Sections 42A-1-19 and 42A-1-22 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. The court shall have the power to direct the payment of delinquent taxes, special assessments and rental or other charges owed out of the amount determined to be just compensation and to make orders as the court deems necessary with respect to encumbrances, liens, rents, insurance and other just and equitable charges.\n\nD. The judgment shall credit against the total amount awarded to the condemnee any payments or deposits paid over to him made before the date of entry of judgment by the condemnor as compensation for the property taken, including any funds which the condemnee withdrew from the amount deposited by the condemnor pursuant to the provisions of Section 42A-1-19 or 42A-1-22 NMSA 1978.\n\nE. If the amount to be credited against the award under Subsection D of this section exceeds the total amount awarded, the court shall require that the condemnee pay the excess to the condemnor.\n\nF. The price paid for similar property by one other than the condemnor may be considered on the question of the value of the property condemned or damaged if there is a finding that there have been no material changes in conditions between the date of the prior sale and the date of taking, that the prior sale was made in a free and open market and that the property is sufficiently similar in the relevant market with respect to situation, usability, improvements and other characteristics.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 42A-1-24, enacted by Laws 1981, ch. 125, § 20; 2001, ch. 10, § 1; 2001, ch. 320, § 1.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, substituted \"the rate of ten percent\" for the \"rate of eight percent\" in Subsection B.\n\nLaws 2001, ch. 10, § 1 and Laws 2001, ch. 320, § 1, both effective June 15, 2001, enacted identical amendments to this section. The section was set out as amended by Laws 2001, ch. 320, § 1.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\n\"Taking of property\" in constitutional sense.— Constitutional rights rest on substance, not on form; therefore, liability to pay compensation is not to be evaded by leaving title in the owner while depriving him of the beneficial use of the property. When interference with the use of property by its owner consists of actual entry upon land and its devotion to public use for more than a momentary period, there is a taking of property in the constitutional sense, whether there has been any formal condemnation or not.City of Albuquerque v. Chapman, 1966-NMSC-212, 77 N.M. 86, 419 P.2d 460.\n\nTaking is complete where entry is made upon property by condemnor and act committedwhich indicates an intent to appropriate the property.City of Albuquerque v. Chapman, 1966-NMSC-212, 77 N.M. 86, 419 P.2d 460.\n\nHaving taken property, municipality cannot avoid payment thereforon the basis that if it had not \"taken\" the property, it could have required a gift of the property as a condition for use of the remainder of the tract at some future time.City of Albuquerque v. Chapman, 1966-NMSC-212, 77 N.M. 86, 419 P.2d 460.\n\nTaking not necessary for compensation, if consequential damages.— In order for an owner to be entitled to compensation, a taking is not required. It is sufficient if there are consequential damages.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Harris, 1961-NMSC-165, 69 N.M. 315, 366 P.2d 710.\n\nEffect of legislature's fixing time for assessment of market value.— The legislature may establish some convenient time, as of which the value of the property will be assessed and the amount of compensation fixed, and while, in particular cases, the condemnee might fare better or worse under this than under another possible rule, the condemnee may not complain when, because of market fluctuations, the compensation fixed by this rule is less than the market value at some other time during the condemnation proceedings. Nor is the situation altered when the condemnor is permitted to go into possession prior to the date as of which compensation is fixed, since the market value on that date is unaffected by the identity of the party in possession.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Chavez, 1966-NMSC-222, 77 N.M. 104, 419 P.2d 759.\n\nDate for fixing compensation.— The legislature's selection of the date of filing of the condemnation petition as the valuation date is impermissible because there has been no vesting of title in the condemnor on that date. The date the preliminary order of entry becomes effective is the proper date to use in assessing the value of the property and in fixing the compensation to which the owner is constitutionally entitled.County of Dona Ana ex rel. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Bennett, 1994-NMSC-005, 116 N.M. 778, 867 P.2d 1160.\n\nEffect of subsequent higher land sales on damages.— Landowner was damaged by the taking even though the value of the land after the date the condemnation action was filed was higher than the value of the land on the date when compensation was assessed.City of Albuquerque v. Chapman, 1966-NMSC-212, 77 N.M. 86, 419 P.2d 460.\n\nEffect of stipulation as to future damages.— Where there is no conflict between the parties hereto as to the future damages stipulated to, of which the trial court had notice, the judgment should conform to the strict wording of the stipulation.Transwestern Pipe Line Co. v. Yandell, 1961-NMSC-173, 69 N.M. 448, 367 P.2d 938.\n\nEffect of voluntary abandonment by nonuse on underlying fee.— Where the public use of the street surface continues, the authorities generally agree that the possibility of voluntary abandonment by nonuse is so remote and improbable that the underlying fee has no substantial value in a condemnation proceeding.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Myers, 1963-NMSC-117, 72 N.M. 319, 383 P.2d 274.\n\nPrice for abutting lots includes value of underlying, abutting fees.— In the absence of a special value, the price fixed for the abutting lots taken in condemnation includes any value of the underlying abutting fee in the streets and alleys carried with condemnation of such abutting lots.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Myers, 1963-NMSC-117, 72 N.M. 319, 383 P.2d 274.\n\nInterest from time owner's possession invaded.— The owner of land taken in condemnation proceedings should have interest from the time his possession is invaded, either with or without an order of the court.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Peace Found., Inc., 1968-NMSC-173, 79 N.M. 576, 446 P.2d 443.\n\nWhen immediate possession is granted to condemnor,however, the condemnee is deprived of the use of his property between the date of such entry and the date when the compensation is paid to him. He would therefore be entitled to interest on the amount of the award from the date of entry by the condemnor.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Chavez, 1966-NMSC-222, 77 N.M. 104, 419 P.2d 759.\n\nSuspension of interest from date of continuance is error.— The allowing of interest from the date the petition is filed is essential to just compensation and the trial court erred by suspending interest from date of continuance until jury verdict.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Peace Found., Inc., 1968-NMSC-173, 79 N.M. 576, 446 P.2d 443.\n\nRailroad improvements not fixtures.— The railroad improvements put upon lands included in a coal entry, previous to condemnation proceedings, even when the entry is a wilful and violent trespass, do not become a fixture of the land, and are not to be taken into consideration in estimating compensation.Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. v. Richter, 1915-NMSC-008, 20 N.M. 278, 148 P. 478.\n\nParties with debt claims against the property owner,whether unsecured or recorded, could not meaningfully participate in condemnation proceedings as \"condemnees\". Rather, parties with such claims must rely for relief on the allocation proceedings conducted under Subsection C of this section.City of Sunland Park v. Santa Teresa Servs. Co., 2003-NMCA-106, 134 N.M. 243, 75 P.3d 843, cert. denied, 134 N.M. 179, 74 P.3d 1071.\n\nII. COMPENSABLE DAMAGES.\n\nLost profits for temporary physical taking.— In an inverse condemnation proceeding for a temporary physical taking, lost profits may be recovered when they are the best measure of damages of the value of the lost use and enjoyment of condemned land.Primetime Hospitality, Inc. v City of Albuquerque, 2009-NMSC-011, 146 N.M. 1, 206 P.3d 112,rev'g2007-NMCA-129, 142 N.M. 663, 168 P.3d 1087.\n\nWhere the landowner had begun constructing a hotel when the landowner accidentally ruptured an encroaching municipal waterline; the opening of the hotel was delayed, lost business damages were the only measure of the loss of use and possession of the property during the temporary taking; and lost profits injuries were directly caused by the encroaching waterline, lost profits for the period of time during which the opening of the hotel was delayed was the best evidence of the value of the property taken.Primetime Hospitality, Inc. v City of Albuquerque, 2009-NMSC-011, 146 N.M. 1, 206 P.3d 112,rev'g2007-NMCA-129, 142 N.M. 663, 168 P.3d 1087.\n\nExcess construction costs for temporary physical taking.— In an inverse condemnation proceeding for a temporary physical taking, construction costs that are a direct result of the taking and that are necessary to put the landowner in the position the landowner would have been had no taking occurred are compensable.Primetime Hospitality, Inc. v City of Albuquerque, 2009-NMSC-011, 146 N.M. 1, 206 P.3d 112,rev'g2007-NMCA-129, 142 N.M. 663, 168 P.3d 1087.\n\nWhere the landowner had begun constructing a hotel when the landowner accidentally ruptured an encroaching municipal waterline; the landowner incurred additional construction costs to repair water damage and to construct a buttress wall to permit construction to proceed, the expenses were a direct result of the municipality's temporary physical taking of the property and are compensable.Primetime Hospitality, Inc. v City of Albuquerque, 2009-NMSC-011, 146 N.M. 1, 206 P.3d 112,rev'g2007-NMCA-129, 142 N.M. 663, 168 P.3d 1087.\n\nLoss of growing crops.— Where an existing crop is a condition that a willing, unobligated buyer would consider in arriving at a price for the property, crop damages may be included in a condemnation award as special or consequential damages.El Paso Elec. Co. v. Pinkerton, 1981-NMSC-039, 96 N.M. 473, 632 P.2d 350.\n\nLessees' right to compensation just as fixed as owner.— Appellant lessees' right to compensation is just as fixed and complete as is the right of the owner of property which had been condemned and the property actually entered. The rights of appellants are in no way altered after the date of notice by the fact that they continued to enjoy free access even though the enjoyment was in violation of the court order for which they could have been held in contempt.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Chavez, 1966-NMSC-222, 77 N.M. 104, 419 P.2d 759.\n\nExistence of compensable damages factual question.— The line between noncompensable damage through an exercise of the police power, and damage for which payment must be made for a taking under eminent domain is one not easily drawn, and the supreme court has not attempted to state a rule of universal application, but will decide each case as it arises.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Harris, 1961-NMSC-165, 69 N.M. 315, 366 P.2d 710.\n\nRight to access compensable.— The right to access is a property right, and the same may not be taken or damaged without the payment of compensation.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Chavez, 1966-NMSC-222, 77 N.M. 104, 419 P.2d 759.\n\nGrade change not compensable, unless material.— It is not every change of grade which would be compensable. It must be a material change, and one which causes consequential damage. Injury which is the result of the proper imposition of regulations under the police power is not compensable.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Harris, 1961-NMSC-165, 69 N.M. 315, 366 P.2d 710.\n\nLoss based on unfounded fears.— In a partial condemnation action, a property owner is entitled to receive as compensation the diminution in value of the remainder of the property caused by public perception of the use to which the condemned property will be put. Under this view, compensation is awarded for loss of market value even if the loss is based on fears not founded on objective standards.City of Santa Fe v. Komis, 1992-NMSC-051, 114 N.M. 659, 845 P.2d 753.\n\nIII. MEASURE OF DAMAGES.\n\nDeduction for a contribution in aid of construction.— The amount previously paid as a contribution in aid of construction of property by a condemnor to a condemnee in a condemnation action of the same property may not be deducted from the fair market value of the property that the condemnor owes the condemnee as compensation for the taking.Moriarty School Dist. Bd. of Education v. Thunder Mtn. Water Co., 2007-NMSC-031, 141 N.M. 824, 161 P.3d 869.\n\nCredit for contribution in aid of construction.— The contribution in aid of construction that a school district paid a regulated public utility for a water line extension to receive water service cannot be credited against the amount awarded to the utility in an action by the school district to acquire the water line extension by eminent domain.Moriarty Mun. Sch. Dist. v. Thunder Mountain Water Co., 2006-NMCA-135, 140 N.M. 612, 145 P.3d 92, cert. granted, 2006-NMCERT-010, 140 N.M. 674 146 P.3d 809.\n\nMethod of calculating damages.— In arriving at the proper amount of compensation to be allowed in condemnation proceedings, the correct measure of damages is the difference in the value of the property immediately before the taking and the value of the property immediately after the taking, the owner being entitled to the difference in these sums, in addition to a recovery for the various elements of damage to the remaining land not taken but injuriously affected.Transwestern Pipe Line Co. v. Yandell, 1961-NMSC-173, 69 N.M. 448, 367 P.2d 938.\n\nDamages recoverable cannot exceed value of land taken.— Where no testimony concerning compensable elements of damage were pointed out to the court except the value of the land taken, the damages recoverable could not exceed the value of the land taken.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Brock, 1968-NMSC-165, 80 N.M. 80, 451 P.2d 984.\n\nBefore and after rule.— The so-called before and after rule, whereby the owner of property is entitled to recover as compensation the amount the fair market value of his property is depreciated by the taking is applicable where damage to property results from a change in grade.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Harris, 1961-NMSC-165, 69 N.M. 315, 366 P.2d 710.\n\nUnity rule.— The unity rule is applied to ascertain whether two or more parcels of property constitute a single larger tract for the purpose of calculating the fair market value of the property taken or the severance damages to the remaining land that is not subject to condemnation. To apply the unity rule, generally the following three facts should be present: physical contiguity, unity of use, and unity of ownership. The combined presence of all three factors, however, is not a prerequisite to the rule's application.Yates Petroleum Corp. v. Kennedy, 1989-NMSC-039, 108 N.M. 564, 775 P.2d 1281.\n\nBoth benefits and detriments considered.— In applying the before and after rule, the court must consider both benefits and detriments to the property by reason of the taking of the land.Board of Trustees v. Spencer, 1965-NMSC-159, 75 N.M. 636, 409 P.2d 269.\n\nFair market value.— Fair market value, which includes in its determination all relative elements of injury and benefit received by the landowner, is theoretically what a willing seller would take and a willing buyer offer; but as a willing seller is usually lacking in condemnation cases, the court has a special responsibility for seeing that the seller receives what is honestly due him, as well as for making sure that under the pressure of compulsion the seller does not gouge the public for more than his property is reasonably worth.Board of Comm'rs v. Gardner, 1953-NMSC-047, 57 N.M. 478, 260 P.2d 682.\n\nValue determined by highest and best use.— When evaluating the worth of property in eminent domain proceedings one should consider the entire property worth in the market before the taking, considering not merely the uses to which it was applied at the time of condemnation but the highest and best uses for which it was adaptable.City of Albuquerque v. Chapman, 1966-NMSC-034, 76 N.M. 162, 413 P.2d 204;City of Clovis v. Ware, 1981-NMSC-076, 96 N.M. 479, 632 P.2d 356.\n\nThe value of the property is determined by considering not merely the uses to which it was applied at the time of condemnation, but the highest and best uses to which it could be put. Determination of the highest and best use should be made with regard to the existing business or wants of the community, or such as may be reasonably expected in the immediate future.City of Albuquerque v. PCA-Albuquerque #19, 1993-NMCA-043, 115 N.M. 739, 858 P.2d 406.\n\nValue not in accordance with condemnor's value.— It has long been established that the value of the property taken by eminent domain is not appraised in accordance with any special value to the condemnor.Board of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Vargas, 1966-NMSC-106, 76 N.M. 369, 415 P.2d 57.\n\nDetermination of improper award.— Where the awards in condemnation proceeding are far below and outside the bounds of the testimony of any witness, they are improper.AT & T Co. v. Walker, 1967-NMSC-049, 77 N.M. 755, 427 P.2d 267.\n\nIV. PROOF OF DAMAGES.\n\nExpert must know property values in vicinity.— Because the expert in a condemnation case lacked knowledge of property values in the vicinity of the condemned property, he was not qualified to express an opinion quantifying the decrease in value of the property in either actual dollar or percentage terms.City of Albuquerque v. PCA-Albuquerque #19, 1993-NMCA-043, 115 N.M. 739, 858 P.2d 406.\n\nOpinions by real estate appraisers on before and after market valuesmust be considered in connection with related facts on which they are based, and a satisfactory explanation must be given as to how the witness arrived at his conclusion.City of Albuquerque v. Chapman, 1966-NMSC-034, 76 N.M. 162, 413 P.2d 204;City of Albuquerque v. Chapman, 1966-NMSC-212, 77 N.M. 86, 419 P.2d 460.\n\nOwner of realty competent to testify as to value.— As owner of real property is presumed to have special knowledge as to its value by reason of ownership and is therefor competent to testify to value.City of Albuquerque v. Ackerman, 1971-NMSC-032, 82 N.M. 360, 482 P.2d 63.\n\nAdmissibility of evidence of other sales within court's discretion.— A trial judge is granted a wide discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence of other sales, taking into consideration, among other things, whether the price paid was sufficiently voluntary to be a reasonable index of value.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Bassett, 1970-NMSC-051, 81 N.M. 345, 467 P.2d 11.\n\nThe rule is well established that the decision of the question whether or not conditions surrounding another tract of land or the sale thereof are sufficiently similar to the circumstances of the pending case and the land involved therein so that evidence as to the sale price may be admitted to prove the value of the land in controversy rests largely within the discretion of the trial court.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Bassett, 1970-NMSC-051, 81 N.M. 345, 467 P.2d 11.\n\nExclusion of evidence of other sales.— If the trial court, in its discretion, determined that the prices paid to other landowners were not reasonable estimates of the value of the land in this case, or that the owners settled for less than the land might have brought on the open market in order to avoid litigation, the supreme court will not rule that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the evidence.Transwestern Pipe Line Co. v. Yandell, 1961-NMSC-173, 69 N.M. 448, 367 P.2d 938.\n\nProof of specific offers of purchase is not admissible to establish reasonable valuein condemnation proceedings.Middle Rio Grande Conservancy Dist. v. Crabtree, 1961-NMSC-134, 69 N.M. 197, 365 P.2d 442.\n\nAssessed value not evidence of value.— By itself, the assessed value of property is not competent direct evidence of value for purposes other than taxation.El Paso Elec. Co. v. Landers, 1970-NMSC-001, 82 N.M. 265, 479 P.2d 769.\n\nJury permitted to use knowledge gained by view of land.— The jury is permitted under the law to use their knowledge gained by a view of the land in question, not only to interpret the evidence offered in the case, but also as independent evidence of the facts as these appeared to them individually on the view.Board of Comm'rs v. Gardner, 1953-NMSC-047, 57 N.M. 478, 260 P.2d 682.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Property Owners in Condemnation Actions May Receive Compensation for Diminution in Value to Their Property Caused by Public Perception:City of Santa Fe v.

      "text": "In any condemnation proceeding in which there is a partial taking of property, the measure of compensation and damages resulting from the taking shall be the difference between the fair market value of the entire property immediately before the taking and the fair market value of the property remaining immediately after the taking. In determining such difference, all elements which would enhance or diminish the fair market value before and after the taking shall be considered even though some of the damages sustained by the remaining property, in themselves, might otherwise be deemed noncompensable. Further, in determining such values or differences therein, elements which would enhance or benefit any property not taken shall only be considered for the purpose of offsetting any damages or diminution of value to the property not taken.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 42A-1-26, enacted by Laws 1981, ch. 125, § 22.\n\nNo constitutional violations.— All arguments to the effect that the predecessor to this section denies equal protection of the law, is vague, indefinite and uncertain, amounts to an unauthorized donation and is violative of the constitutional requirement of separation of the powers of government are specious and fail to find support in the law.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Hesselden Inv. Co., 1972-NMSC-071, 84 N.M. 424, 504 P.2d 634.\n\nPurpose of section.— The language of this section codifies the correct and existing rule or measure of damages in cases of a partial taking, in harmony and compliance with the payment of just compensation for the taking of private property as required by N.M. Const., art. II, § 20.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Hesselden Inv. Co., 1972-NMSC-071, 84 N.M. 424, 504 P.2d 634.\n\nDate of taking.— Clearly and logically the date of taking, whether partial or whole, was the date on which the condemnor became vested with the legal right to possession, dominion and control over the real estate being condemned.State ex rel. State Hwy. Dep't v. Yurcic, 1973-NMSC-059, 85 N.M. 220, 511 P.2d 546;State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Hesselden Inv. Co., 1972-NMSC-071, 84 N.M. 424, 504 P.2d 634.\n\nReason for fixing date of taking.— The reason that most eminent domain statutes fix the time as of which property taken or damaged is to be valued is that values of real estate are not constant and sometimes change greatly before proceedings are completed. The reasoning which compels this rule is not applicable to the nonfluctuating rule or measure of damages in a condemnation case and furnishes no basis for equating the valuation date with the date of taking.State ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Hesselden Inv. Co., 1972-NMSC-071, 84 N.M. 424, 504 P.2d 634.\n\nValuation of property after taking.— Where part of a tract of land has been taken, the question is how much less is the tract as a whole worth with the piece taken out of it than it was worth before the taking? In determining the value of the property after the taking, the tribunal assessing the damages must take into consideration every element which a purchaser willing but not obliged to buy would consider, and separate items may be considered not as specific items of loss, but merely with respect to their effect upon the market value.Board of Trustees v. B.J. Serv., Inc., 1965-NMSC-109, 75 N.M. 459, 406 P.2d 171.\n\nIn a proceeding to condemn part of a tract of land, the rule that the part taken should be valued as part of the whole does not mean that it must be valued according to its proportional value of the whole by multiplying the number of square feet therein by the square foot value of the entire tract. In assessing value of the part taken, the trier of facts must consider the part's value arising from its availability for use in conjunction with the part not taken, and any increased value inhering in the part taken as a part of the larger tract must be reflected in the award to the owners.Transwestern Pipe Line Co. v. Yandell, 1961-NMSC-173, 69 N.M. 448, 367 P.2d 938.\n\nTo value the entire tract before the taking and reduce that value to a square footage price tag and then use that price tag to determine the value of land remaining after the partial taking is to beg the question. It is only by considering the difference between the value of the entire tract before the taking and the value of the remainder after the taking through separate and independent valuations that the presence or absence and the extent of damages or benefits or both are determined.Transwestern Pipe Line Co. v. Yandell, 1961-NMSC-173, 69 N.M. 448, 367 P.2d 938.\n\nThe evidence of the market value per acre of the whole tract before the taking, employed as a basis in determining the value of the easement, does not, then, appear to represent the \"full fee value\" of the easement areas separated from the entire tracts.Transwestern Pipe Line Co. v. Yandell, 1961-NMSC-173, 69 N.M. 448, 367 P.2d 938.\n\nWhen there is not substantial evidence to demonstrate that the property has been diminished in fair market value by reason of a partial taking, the \"before and after\" rule loses its relevancy and the proper alternative measure of compensation would be the fair market value of the property actually taken.Yates Petroleum Corp. v. Kennedy, 1989-NMSC-039, 108 N.M. 564, 775 P.2d 1281.\n\nWhen a portion of a company's parcel of property was condemned for construction of an access road from a frontage road to a landfill, both of which were already city-owned property, the company was not entitled to compensation for any reduction in the value of the uncondemned portion of its parcel resulting from the proximity of the landfill and the increased traffic on the frontage road.City of Albuquerque v. Westland Dev. Co., 1995-NMCA-136, 121 N.M. 144, 909 P.2d 25, cert. denied, 120 N.M. 828, 907 P.2d 1009, and cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1244, 116 S. Ct. 2499, 135 L. Ed. 2d 190 (1996).\n\nEnhancement of property value by condemnation.— If the remaining land is enhanced in value as a result of the project requiring the condemnation, that enhancement can only be used to offset damages to the value of the remaining property.Yates Petroleum Corp. v. Kennedy, 1989-NMSC-039, 108 N.M. 564, 775 P.2d 1281.\n\nValue determined by highest and best uses.— The value of the property is determined by considering not merely the uses to which it was applied at the time of condemnation, but the highest and best uses to which it could be put.City of Clovis v. Ware, 1981-NMSC-076, 96 N.M. 479, 632 P.2d 356.\n\nTwo parcels of land may be deemed one tractfor the purpose of condemnation when they are contiguous or in near proximity and are united in use and ownership, even though the parcels are separated by a drainage channel.State ex rel. State Hwy. Dep't v. Strosnider, 1987-NMCA-136, 106 N.M. 608, 747 P.2d 254.\n\nDiminution of value where sewage facility placed on condemned tract.— Where expert testimony is introduced into evidence showing that placement of a sewage facility on the condemned portion of a tract, regardless of whether noxious odors come from the facility, will diminish the value of the remaining land, the trial court must consider any resultant diminution in the fair market value of the remaining property.City of Clovis v. Ware, 1981-NMSC-076, 96 N.M. 479, 632 P.2d 356.\n\nWhen \"after\" value less than \"before\" value.— When only a portion of the condemnee's property is actually taken, ascertainment of the fair market value of the entire property immediately before the taking and the fair market value of that remaining immediately after the taking is required and if the \"after\" value be less than \"before\" value, then this difference is the damage to which the condemnee is entitled.Roosevelt Cnty. Elec. Coop. v. Bowley, 1967-NMSC-121, 78 N.M. 9, 427 P.2d 894.\n\nJust compensation in partial takings cases.— In partial takings cases, just compensation includes all elements of damages, including lost or impaired access, that result from the taking and reduce the fair market value of the owner's remaining property, regardless of whether those elements would have been considered compensable under precedent decided before NMSA 1978, § 42A-1-26 took effect.City of Albuquerque v. Tecolote Res., 2024-NMCA-029, cert. denied.\n\nUnreasonableness requirement applies only when no land is taken but landowner seeks damages for lost or impaired access.— Where the city of Albuquerque (city) initiated a condemnation proceeding to aid in its construction of the Albuquerque rapid transit system (ART) and eventually took a 5,279 square-foot strip of defendant's property along Central avenue, and where the parties agreed that the fair market value of the taken land was $69,350, and where defendant sought an additional $2,931,454 to compensate defendant for impairment of access to its remaining property, claiming that before the taking, defendant's property had several access points through which people who were traveling both east and west on Central avenue could enter and exit, but after the taking and in constructing ART, access to defendant's property was impaired, and where a jury awarded defendant a total of $712,000 to compensate it for the agreed upon value of the taken land and for impairment of access to its remaining land, and where the city argued that the district court erred by refusing the city's proposed instruction based on UJI 13-719 NMRA, claiming that the refusal to give the instruction was prejudicial because the jury was allowed to award damages without first determining the question of reasonableness, there was no error in instructing the jury, because the unreasonableness requirement in UJI 13-719 NMRA applies only when no land is taken but the landowner nevertheless seeks damages for lost or impaired access, and, in this case, a partial taking had occurred.City of Albuquerque v. Tecolote Res., 2024-NMCA-029, cert. denied.\n\nSupplemental causation instruction unnecessary where uniform jury instruction correctly conveyed the causation requirement.— Where the city of Albuquerque (city) initiated a condemnation proceeding to aid in its construction of the Albuquerque rapid transit system (ART) and eventually took a 5,279 square-foot strip of defendant's property along Central avenue, and where the parties agreed that the fair market value of the taken land was $69,350, and where defendant sought an additional $2,931,454 to compensate defendant for impairment of access to its remaining property, claiming that before the taking, defendant's property had several access points through which people who were traveling both east and west on Central avenue could enter and exit, but after the taking and in constructing ART, access to defendant's property was impaired, and where a jury awarded defendant a total of $712,000 to compensate it for the agreed upon value of the taken land and for impairment of access to its remaining land, and where the city argued that the district court erred by refusing to give a requested causation instruction, there was no error in instructing the jury, because the district court gave the jury an instruction based on UJI 13-722 NMRA that addressed causation, and the city failed in its burden of showing why the given instruction failed to adequately convey the causation requirement to the jury such that it was necessary to also give the supplemental causation instruction requested by the city.City of Albuquerque v. Tecolote Res., 2024-NMCA-029, cert. denied.\n\nImprovement costs considered.— It is proper to consider the cost of improvements for restoration purposes and relocation costs as helpful aids in determining the difference in the before and after values of the property. However, such prospective expenditures are not, themselves, proper elements of damage.Board of Trustees v. B.J. Serv., Inc., 1965-NMSC-109, 75 N.M. 459, 406 P.2d 171.\n\nApplication of rule where loss of irrigation water.— The well-established measure of damages in eminent domain in this jurisdiction is the before and after rule, by which the owner is entitled to recover, as compensation, the amount by which the fair market value of his property has been depreciated by the taking and although the loss of irrigation water is not, in itself, a proper element of damage, the loss of trees, grass, shrubbery and other vegetation caused by the disruption of the water supply is a factor in the determination of the value of the property after the taking.Board of Trustees v. Spencer, 1965-NMSC-159, 75 N.M. 636, 409 P.2d 269.\n\nUnity rule.— The unity rule is applied to ascertain whether two or more parcels of property constitute a single larger tract for the purpose of calculating the fair market value of the property taken or the severance damages to the remaining land that is not subject to condemnation. To apply the unity rule, generally the following three facts should be present: physical contiguity, unity of use, and unity of ownership. The combined presence of all three factors, however, is not a prerequisite to the rule's application.Yates Petroleum Corp. v. Kennedy, 1989-NMSC-039, 108 N.M. 564, 775 P.2d 1281.\n\nGenerally, damages not recoverable due to loss of business.— A condemnee may not recover damages by way of expenses or loss of business for temporary inconvenience, annoyance or interference with access occasioned by construction, unless the period of construction was unduly long or the conduct of the condemnor causing the loss was unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, and where there was no evidence which would warrant a finding that the period of construction was unduly long or that the contractor or highway department acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or capriciously in accomplishing the construction, the evidence as to loss or damage by reason of construction itself merited no legal recognition, and should not have been admitted.State ex rel. State Hwy. Dep't v. Kistler-Collister Co., 1975-NMSC-039, 88 N.M. 221, 539 P.2d 611.\n\nOr for mere frustration of future plans.— Mere frustration of the owner's hopes or plans for the future is a noncompensable element of damages. However, compensation for frustration of future hopes or plans is not the same as compensation based on planned future uses for which the property is adaptable.State ex rel. State Hwy. Dep't v. Kistler-Collister Co., 1975-NMSC-039, 88 N.M. 221, 539 P.2d 611.\n\nSubstantial interference based on precondemnation activities is a question of fact.— In a condemnation proceeding brought by the city of Albuquerque (city) to acquire a thirty-foot wide strip of land to build a road on property operated as a freight truck terminal where the property owner asserted an inverse condemnation claim seeking consequential damages against the city, including lost rental income and devaluation of the property adjacent to the thirty-foot wide strip that the city condemned, and where the city filed a motion for partial summary judgment and argued that its precondemnation activities did not substantially interfere with the property owner's use of the property, and therefore there was no inverse condemnation claim, and that the lost rental income was not compensable, the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the inverse condemnation claim because the question of substantial interference is a question of disputed material fact and a rational jury could conclude that there was substantial interference in this case based on evidence that the city's intended condemnation impacted a lessee's operations to a point that the lessee determined it was no longer feasible to continue operations of its freight terminal on the land owner's property.City of Albuquerque v. SMP Properties, LLC, 2021-NMSC-011,aff'g2019-NMCA-004, 433 P.3d 336.\n\nLost rents as damages.— In a condemnation proceeding brought by the city of Albuquerque (city) to acquire a thirty-foot wide strip of land to build a road on property operated as a freight truck terminal, and where the property owner asserted, in part, that the city's condemnation actions proximately caused a property tenant not to renew its lease with the property owner, resulting in consequential damages, the district court erred in granting the city of Albuquerque's motion for summary judgment on the claim for damages based on its ruling that the value of the tenant's lease is not a compensable element of damage for a partial taking, because a property owner is constitutionally entitled to fair market value that occurs before the condemnation action is actually filed and the property actually taken when the condemning authority has, prior to instituting formal condemnation proceedings, evidenced an unequivocal intention to take the specific parcel of land, and the condemning authority's communication of its intention to third parties or the public in general substantially impacts the fair market value of the property.City of Albuquerque v. SMP Properties, 2019-NMCA-004, cert. granted.\n\nDamages for land taken by utility held improper.— Award of damages to owners of land partially taken by public utility based on the before and after values by giving damages for the acreage taken, plus damages to the lands not taken under the guise of per utility pole location is improper.Roosevelt Cnty. Elec. Coop. v. Bowley, 1967-NMSC-121, 78 N.M. 9, 427 P.2d 894.\n\nWhen proceedings abandoned, no incidental damages.— A county can unilaterally abandon condemnation proceedings following the entry of a permanent order of entry (in fact, anytime before the entry of a final judgment confirming the compensation award), subject to paying compensation for the temporary taking that occurred and other expenses necessary to do equity. In assessing these damages and expenses, however, the court should not award any damages for any reduction in value to the property based solely on its relocation. Because there is no permanent taking of property, the owner has no right to any incidental damages to what would have otherwise been the remainder of the property.County of Bernalillo v. Morris, 1994-NMCA-038, 117 N.M. 398, 872 P.2d 371.\n\nScope of presentation to jury.— In a condemnation suit it was proper for the jury in fixing damages to consider the property owner's plans for the development of its property. However, the jury was entitled to have presented to it for its consideration alternate plans for the further development of the property for commercial purposes, as well as evidence of other uses for which it was suitable or adaptable, in determining the before and after fair market value of the property, the development of the property for commercial purposes not being limited to the owner's plans for such development.State ex rel.

A person authorized to exercise the right of eminent domain who has taken or damaged or who may take or damage any property for public use without making just compensation or without instituting and prosecuting to final judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction any proceeding for condemnation is liable to the condemnee, or any subsequent grantee thereof, for the value thereof or the damage thereto at the time the property is or was taken or damaged, with ten percent per year interest, to the date such just compensation is made, in an action to be brought under and governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts of this state. Actions under this section shall be brought in the county where the land or any portion thereof is located.\n\nB. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A of this section or any other provision of law regarding compensation for damage in the situation described in that subsection:\n\n(1) if the person authorized had taken or been granted for public use, pursuant to a final judgment, an order of immediate possession or private agreement, any property;\n\n(2) the property subsequently taken or damaged was contiguous to the property taken or granted; and\n\n(3) the person takes or damages property contiguous to property previously taken or granted from the condemnee or grantor without making just compensation or without instituting and prosecuting to final judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction any proceeding for condemnation; the condemnee or grantor shall receive compensation for the land taken or damaged at the greater of fair market value or a unit rate of five times that of the compensation or consideration he received for the land taken; provided that if the width of the property taken or damaged is not equal to the width originally taken or damaged, compensation required pursuant to this subsection shall be increased or reduced ratably in accordance with the relationship of the respective widths.\n\nC. Any amounts paid under Subsection B of this section shall be deemed just compensation.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 42A-1-29, enacted by Laws 1981, ch. 125, § 25; 1983, ch. 131, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 1981, ch. 125, § 61 provided that all references to 42-1-23 NMSA 1978 shall be construed as references to 42A-1-29 NMSA 1978.\n\nCross references.— For the New Mexico Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts,seeRules 1-001 to 1-127 NMRA.\n\nThe 1983 amendmentdesignated the formerly undesignated language as Subsection A, substituted \"ten percent per year interest\" for \"eight percent per year interest\" in the first sentence of Subsection A and added Subsections B and C.\n\nFactors to determine if pre-condemnation publicity and planning constitutes a taking.— To determine whether pre-condemnation publicity and planning constitute a taking, a court must consider whether the government had publicly announced a present intention to condemn the property in question and whether the government has done something that substantially interferes with the landowner's use and enjoyment of its property.Santa Fe Pacific Trust, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 2014-NMCA-093, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-008.\n\nPublicity surrounding proposed condemnation was not a taking.— Where two mayors publicly targeted plaintiff's property as a potential location for an event arena; the municipality had informed plaintiff that plaintiff's property would be taken for that purpose; the municipality adopted a development plan that included the goal of constructing an event arena on a site that included plaintiff's property and began a process to determine the feasibility of constructing the event arena; the municipality issued a request for information and a request for proposals that included plaintiff's property and publicly announced the proposed project; the municipality attempted to purchase the property from plaintiff; local newspapers published many articles about the proposed project that mentioned plaintiff's property as a potential site; the municipal council never approved the acquisition or condemnation or appropriated funding for construction of an arena; some potential buyers and tenants of plaintiff's property were deterred by the possibility of imminent condemnation; and plaintiff sued the municipality for inverse condemnation alleging that plaintiff lost potential sales and leases because of the publicity surrounding the municipality's plan to condemn plaintiff's property, plaintiff failed to establish an inverse condemnation under the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment and under the New Mexico constitution and statutory law because the municipality's planning activities, which never came to fruition, did not prevent plaintiff from possessing the property or from using it.Santa Fe Pacific Trust, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 2014-NMCA-093, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-008.\n\nSubstantial interference based on precondemnation activities is a question of fact.— In a condemnation proceeding brought by the city of Albuquerque (city) to acquire a thirty-foot wide strip of land to build a road on property operated as a freight truck terminal where the property owner asserted an inverse condemnation claim seeking consequential damages against the city, including lost rental income and devaluation of the property adjacent to the thirty-foot wide strip that the city condemned, and where the city filed a motion for partial summary judgment and argued that its precondemnation activities did not substantially interfere with the property owner's use of the property, and therefore there was no inverse condemnation claim, and that the lost rental income was not compensable, the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the inverse condemnation claim because the question of substantial interference is a question of disputed material fact and a rational jury could conclude that there was substantial interference in this case based on evidence that the city's intended condemnation impacted a lessee's operations to a point that the lessee determined it was no longer feasible to continue operations of its freight terminal on the land owner's property.City of Albuquerque v. SMP Properties, LLC, 2021-NMSC-011,aff'g2019-NMCA-004, 433 P.3d 336.\n\nInverse condemnation.— An inverse condemnation claim is available to a property owner when private property has been taken or damaged by a public entity for a public use and the public entity has not paid just compensation or brought a formal condemnation proceeding.City of Albuquerque v. SMP Properties, 2019-NMCA-004, cert. granted.\n\nInverse condemnation statute construed.— Fair compensation for damage to land caused by an adjoining public use can be obtained by a landowner in an inverse condemnation action brought under Subsection A of this section without any additional requirements, apart from a showing of damage from public use; a claim for compensation for damage to land adjoining a public use brought under Subsection A does not depend upon an original transaction where the government purchased less land from the same grantor than it needed. Subsection B of this section creates a right of action, which provides a statutory measure of \"just compensation\" to a private landowner when the government uses its power of eminent domain to take or purchase less property than it needs for the intended public use, resulting in damage to the grantor's adjoining property.Van Buskirk v. City of Raton, 2022-NMCA-040, cert. denied.\n\nSummary judgment was proper where plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action under § 42A-1-29(B) NMSA 1978.— Where plaintiffs filed a cause of action for quintuple damages for inverse condemnation against the city of Raton (city), alleging that the city failed to properly cover trash from a landfill on land that was contiguous to plaintiffs' grazing land, and where the district court granted the city's motion for summary judgment, finding that plaintiffs were not the \"grantors or condemnees\" of the property previously taken for the landfill and that plaintiffs, not being the real parties in interest, did not have standing to sue on the previous owner's behalf, the district court did not err in granting the city's motion for summary judgment, because plaintiffs' reading of New Mexico's inverse condemnation statute fails to consider both the requirements that the government under-purchased land in the original transaction and that the damage to the grantor's land resulted from or was caused by that under-purchase of land, and it was undisputed in the summary judgment record that plaintiffs were not the grantors from whom the city purchased the landfill that caused the damage alleged in this case and there was no evidence of subsequent damage resulting from the original transaction. Plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action under § 42A-1-29(B) NMSA 1978.Van Buskirk v. City of Raton, 2022-NMCA-040, cert. denied.\n\nSubstantial interference.— In a condemnation proceeding brought by the city of Albuquerque (city) to acquire a thirty-foot wide strip of land to build a road on property operated as a freight truck terminal, and where the property owner asserted that the city's condemnation actions proximately caused a property tenant not to renew its lease with the property owner, resulting in inverse condemnation, the district court erred in granting the city's motion for summary judgment, because there were issues of material fact about whether the city's precondemnation activities constitute substantial interference with the property owner's property rights.City of Albuquerque v. SMP Properties, 2019-NMCA-004, cert. granted.\n\nLost profits for temporary physical taking.— In an inverse condemnation proceeding for a temporary physical taking, lost profits may be recovered when they are the best measure of damages of the value of the lost use and enjoyment of condemned land.Primetime Hospitality, Inc. v City of Albuquerque, 2009-NMSC-011, 146 N.M. 1, 206 P.3d 112,rev'g2007-NMCA-129, 142 N.M. 663, 168 P.3d 1087.\n\nWhere the landowner had begun constructing a hotel when the landowner accidentally ruptured an encroaching municipal waterline; the opening of the hotel was delayed; lost business damages were the only measure of the loss of use and possession of the property during the temporary taking; and lost profits injuries were directly caused by the encroaching waterline, lost profits for the period of time during which the opening of the hotel was delayed was the best evidence of the value of the property taken.Primetime Hospitality, Inc. v City of Albuquerque, 2009-NMSC-011, 146 N.M. 1, 206 P.3d 112,rev'g2007-NMCA-129, 142 N.M. 663, 168 P.3d 1087.\n\nExcess construction costs for temporary physical taking.— In an inverse condemnation proceeding for a temporary physical taking, construction costs that are a direct result of the taking and that are necessary to put the landowner in the position the landowner would have been had no taking occurred are compensable.Primetime Hospitality, Inc. v City of Albuquerque, 2009-NMSC-011, 146 N.M. 1, 206 P.3d 112,rev'g2007-NMCA-129, 142 N.M. 663, 168 P.3d 1087.\n\nWhere the landowner had begun constructing a hotel when the landowner accidentally ruptured an encroaching municipal waterline; the landowner incurred additional construction costs to repair water damage and to construct a buttress wall to permit construction to proceed, the expenses were a direct result of the municipality's temporary physical taking of the property and are compensable.Primetime Hospitality, Inc. v City of Albuquerque, 2009-NMSC-011, 146 N.M. 1, 206 P.3d 112,rev'g2007-NMCA-129, 142 N.M. 663, 168 P.3d 1087.\n\nMeasure of damages for a temporary, but total, physical taking of a commercial propertyin the early stages of the construction of a project on the property may include, as a separate element of damages, the excess construction costs directly related to the interruption of the construction project that would not have been incurred but for the condemnor's interference with the owners' loss of possession and use of the property and may include, as a separate element of damages, reasonable expenditures demonstrably aimed at reducing the losses suffered by the owner.Primetime Hospitality, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 2007-NMCA-129, 142 N.M. 663, 168 P. 3d 1087, cert. granted, 2007-NMCERT-009, 142 N.M. 716, 169 P.3d 409,rev'd, 2009-NMSC-011, 146 N.M. 1, 206 P.3d 112.\n\nMeasure of damages for a temporary, but total, physical taking of a commercial propertyin the early stages of the construction of a project on the property may include, as a separate element of damages, the rental value of the property for the period of delay.Primetime Hospitality, Inc. v.

City of Las Cruces, 2014-NMCA-075.\n\nConstitution guarantees compensation when private property injured.— New Mexico Const., art. II, § 20, guarantees adequate compensation, where private property has been damaged through the methods followed or adopted in the design, construction or maintenance of a public highway.Wheeler v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1964-NMSC-081, 74 N.M. 165, 391 P.2d 664.\n\nConstitution does not require advance compensationfor damaging private property in improvement of state highway.Summerford v. Board of Comm'rs, 1931-NMSC-014, 35 N.M. 374, 298 P. 410.\n\n\"Taking\" occurs where all beneficial use of property lost.— Where the landowner does not lose all beneficial use of the property, no \"taking\" or inverse condemnation occurs.Aragon & McCoy v. Albuquerque Nat'l Bank, 1983-NMSC-020, 99 N.M. 420, 659 P.2d 306.\n\nRisk of damage must be foreseeable.— For an act to give rise to a claim for compensation, the act must at least be one in which risk of damage to an owner's property is actually foreseeable by the governmental actor or in which it is so obvious that its incurrence amounts to deliberate infliction of harm for purpose of carrying out the governmental project.Electro-Jet Tool Mfg. Co., Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1992-NMSC-060, 114 N.M. 676, 845 P.2d 770.\n\nDate of taking.— Where village began construction of a drainage pond on a tract of land situated next to plaintiff's land and it was at this point that the plaintiff had notice that the tract would be put to public use, the date of taking for purpose of determining value of the property taken was the date construction began on September 26, 2000, and not the date of the pond's completion on February 14, 2001.Leigh v. Village of Los Lunas, 2005-NMCA-025, 137 N.M. 119, 108 P.3d 525.\n\nRegulatory restriction on use of property.— A regulation which imposes a reasonable restriction on the use of private property will not constitute a \"taking\" of that property if the regulation is: (1) reasonably related to a proper purpose; and (2) does not unreasonably deprive the property owner of all, or substantially all, of the beneficial use of the property. Thus, if a regulation simply prohibits the use of property for purposes declared to be injurious to the health, morals, or safety of the community, the prohibition cannot be deemed a \"taking\" of property for the public benefit.Temple Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of Albuquerque, 1982-NMSC-055, 98 N.M. 138, 646 P.2d 565.\n\nMoratorium on development of land.— A moratorium on the development of land within an area that was considered for a national monument did not amount to a compensable taking because the moratorium was imposed for a limited duration of two and one-half years, and it was designed to preserve the status quo to enable Congress to take legislative action concerning the potential national monument.Santa Fe Village Venture v. City of Albuquerque, 914 F. Supp. 478 (D.N.M. 1995).\n\nUnlawful regulation not a taking.— A regulation not related to a proper purpose that does not deprive a property owner of all or substantially all beneficial use of property simply does not implicate an interest protected by the Takings Clause; thus, although a property owner may have a right to seek redress for an unlawful regulation, the method of redress is not a takings action.Estate of Sanchez v. County of Bernalillo, 1995-NMSC-058, 120 N.M. 395, 902 P.2d 550.\n\nIntent of section.— This section indicates that it was intended to confer a remedy by inverse condemnation to a person whose property is damaged for public use.McClure v. Town of Mesilla, 1979-NMCA-112, 93 N.M. 447, 601 P.2d 80.\n\nInverse condemnation is not common-law tortbased upon the negligence of a town; it is a statutory remedy.McClure v. Town of Mesilla, 1979-NMCA-112, 93 N.M. 447, 601 P.2d 80.\n\nSuit permitted where private property taken and damaged.— This section is clear that suit is permitted by the landowner, when there has been not only a damaging of private property but a taking as well, if just compensation has not been paid, or a proper condemnation action either has not been instituted or prosecuted to final judgment.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. W.S. Ranch Co., 1970-NMSC-043, 81 N.M. 414, 467 P.2d 986.\n\nInverse condemnation, not trespass, proper action to maintain.— Corporation's sending its employees onto the owner's lands, drilling holes or wells in the latter's stream bed, laying a pipeline, all without seeking permission of the landowner, or undertaking to condemn, gave owner remedy inverse condemnation, not an action in trespass.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. W.S. Ranch Co., 1970-NMSC-043, 81 N.M. 414, 467 P.2d 986.\n\nTrespass action proper only when parties mistaken about condemnation.— Where parties are mistaken in their belief that they had the right to condemn, a trespass action would be proper.Kaiser Steel Corp. v. W.S. Ranch Co., 1970-NMSC-043, 81 N.M. 414, 467 P.2d 986.\n\nAuthorized condemnor may be liable in trespass.— An authorized condemnor may be liable in trespass to a property owner for taking more land than is reasonably necessary or for causing excessive damage by the manner in which the taking occurs, but only when there is evidence of fraud, bad faith or gross abuse of discretion.North v. Public Serv. Co., 1983-NMCA-124, 101 N.M. 222, 680 P.2d 603, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 11, 677 P.2d 624.\n\nDamages for trespass when authorized condemnor is liablecover only that portion of the damage over and above what results from the taking itself.North v. Public Serv. Co., 1983-NMCA-124, 101 N.M. 222, 680 P.2d 603, cert. denied, 101 N.M. 11, 677 P.2d 624.\n\nRight to compensation enforceable through civil action.— Constitutional right of compensation for damaging private property by construction or improvement of state highway may be enforced by civil action against the party liable therefor.Summerford v. Board of Comm'rs, 1931-NMSC-014, 35 N.M. 374, 298 P. 410.\n\nRedress of injury in law.— Property owners and tenants occupying premises are not entitled to injunctive relief against the enforcement of a city ordinance prohibiting parking of vehicles on certain streets, where they possessed a speedy, adequate and complete remedy at law for the redress of any injury their property may have suffered.Farnsworth v. City of Roswell, 1957-NMSC-053, 63 N.M. 195, 315 P.2d 839.\n\nInverse condemnation action would not lie if property was not acquired for public use.Brosseau v. N.M. State Hwy. Dep't, 1978-NMSC-098, 92 N.M. 328, 587 P.2d 1339.\n\nInverse condemnation requires damage to right of landowner.— For inverse condemnation to be based upon a \"damage,\" a property owner must suffer some compensable injury that is not suffered by the public in general.Estate of Sanchez v. County of Bernalillo, 1995-NMSC-058, 120 N.M. 395, 902 P.2d 550.\n\nInverse condemnation requires that the condemnee's property be damaged; in this case, there has been no damage and no taking by the electric company since it has continued to use the city's rights-of-way under the terms and conditions of the parties' franchise agreement as it did prior to this controversy.City of Las Cruces v. El Paso Elec. Co., 904 F. Supp. 1238 (D.N.M. 1995).\n\nProspective purchaser entitled to bring action.— A prospective purchaser may maintain an action for damages for the taking of land for highway use by reason of his contract to purchase.Mesich v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1942-NMSC-054, 46 N.M. 412, 129 P.2d 974.\n\nGrantees not entitled to bring action.— A public utility's entry to construct transmission lines did not entitle grantees to a right of recovery, where as of the time of the purchase, this section of the statute expressly provided that it was not applicable to any power or transmission line.Garver v. Public Serv. Co., 1966-NMSC-261, 77 N.M. 262, 421 P.2d 788.\n\nApplicable to right of access.— A right of access is a property right, and may not be taken or damaged without the payment of compensation.Hill v. State Hwy. Comm'n, 1973-NMSC-114, 85 N.M. 689, 516 P.2d 199.\n\nEffect of railroad's entry and possession of premises without landowner's complaint.— When appellant's predecessor did acquire a right in the premises before appellee railroad's entry thereon, and the railroad took possession of the land and used it for its purposes without complaint by the landowners, it acquired all possessory rights to the land, and appellants have a contingent reversionary interest, subject to appellee's qualified fee in the property, until abandonment or forfeiture has been determined.Timberlake v. Southern Pac. Co., 1969-NMSC-143, 80 N.M. 770, 461 P.2d 903.\n\nNo damages recoverable when condemnation abandoned.— Where the state highway department abandoned a condemnation proceeding, the damage that may have occurred was to the condemnees, and was only incidental. No provision is made for the recovery of such incidental damages.State ex rel. State Hwy. Dep't v. Yurcic, 1973-NMSC-059, 85 N.M. 220, 511 P.2d 546.\n\nNo damages recoverable for temporary taking of highway.— The state highway commission's (now state transportation commission's) construction of an interstate created a detour and interfered with appellees' right of access which damaged their business and caused them to travel additional distances for more than one year. This interference was not shown to be the result of unreasonable, unnecessary or arbitrary conduct of the state highway commission (now state transportation commission) so that the temporary interference with access was not compensable.Hill v. State Hwy. Comm'n, 1973-NMSC-114, 85 N.M. 689, 516 P.2d 199.\n\nWhere appellees' access to a highway was unchanged physically by construction, but owing to the use of the new Interstate 40 as the main highway to and from Albuquerque, the old highway on which plaintiff 's property is located was changed to a service road, plaintiff was not entitled to compensation as the abutting landowner has no vested right in the flow of traffic.Hill v. State Hwy. Comm'n, 1973-NMSC-114, 85 N.M. 689, 516 P.2d 199.\n\nCounties liable for lands taken for highway.— Counties are liable under this section for damages to lands taken for highway purposes by them, or with their acquiescence.Wheeler v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1964-NMSC-081, 74 N.M. 165, 391 P.2d 664.\n\nCity's liability continues, although it receives federal aid.— Where a city receives federal aid for the construction of an underpass under a railroad passing through the city, upon condition that the underpass shall be constructed by the state highway commission (now state transportation commission), the underpass does not thereby become a state highway, and the city is liable for damages to adjoining property.Springer Transfer Co. v. City of Albuquerque, 1940-NMSC-039, 44 N.M. 407, 103 P.2d 129.\n\nObjections to expense and inconvenience insufficient to enjoin taking.— In view of this section allowing compensation for property taken for public improvements, or for injury to property, such taking will not be enjoined where plaintiff 's only objection is that he will be put to considerable inconvenience and expense if the improvement is made.Hobbs v. Town of Hot Springs, 1940-NMSC-063, 44 N.M. 592, 106 P.2d 856.\n\nLimitations of actions.— Suit for damages resulting from obstruction of flow and appropriation of waters of a creek was governed, not by the four-year statute of limitations, but by the ten-year statute, water rights being real property.N.M. Prods. Co. v. N.M. Power Co., 1937-NMSC-048, 42 N.M. 311, 77 P.2d 634.\n\nThree-year statute of limitations applies to inverse condemnation proceedings.Buresh v. City of Las Cruces, 1969-NMSC-171, 81 N.M. 89, 463 P.2d 513.\n\nParty cannot raise inverse condemnation theory for first time on appeal.— Where a party does not raise the issue of inverse condemnation at trial, it cannot raise that theory for the first time on appeal.Aragon & McCoy v. Albuquerque Nat'l Bank, 1983-NMSC-020, 99 N.M. 420, 659 P.2d 306.\n\nSection applicable to water damaged property.— The provisions of this section are clear and unambiguous. Should property owners below hospital grounds have their property taken or damaged by water from hospital drainage without just compensation, the owner of such property could institute legal action to recover a judgment for the property taken or damaged. Property owners claiming to be adversely affected will have to show that additional waters have been cast on their lands, however, to recover. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-239.\n\nCondemnation against entire right-of-way preferred when highway needs widening.— Where a right-of-way for a highway needs widening it would be unsafe in many cases to bring condemnation proceedings against merely that portion of the highway required for the increased width as the width already acquired by public use might be in doubt and there is no record title in the county or the state of the existing right-of-way, thus making it better practice to bring condemnation against the entire right-of-way, alleging the extent of the old right-of-way already claimed, and instructing the commissioners to base their assessment upon the additional strips required. 1952 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 52-5624.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —26 Am. Jur. 2d Eminent Domain §§ 138, 139, 140, 152.\n\nNegligence of governmental agent causing damage to private property as \"taking,\" \"damage,\" or \"use,\" for public purposes in constitutional sense, 2 A.L.R.2d 677.\n\nLiability of municipality or other governmental subdivision in connection with flood protection measures, 5 A.L.R.2d 57.\n\nNew or additional compensation for use by municipality or public of subsurface of street or highway for purposes other than sewers, pipes, conduits for wires, and the like, 11 A.L.R.2d 180.\n\nMunicipal regulation of billboards and outdoor advertising as taking property without compensation, 58 A.L.R.2d 1314.\n\nLiability of public utility to abutting owner for destruction or injury of trees in or near highway or street, 64 A.L.R.2d 866.\n\nCompensable property right, restrictive covenant or right to enforcement thereof as, 4 A.L.R.3d 1137.\n\nZoning regulations limiting use of property near airport as taking of property, 18 A.L.R.4th 542.\n\nAirport operations or flight of aircraft as constituting taking or damaging of property, 22 A.L.R.4th 863.\n\nInverse condemnation state court class actions, 49 A.L.R.4th 618.\n\nEminent domain: compensability of loss of visibility of owner's property, 7 A.L.R.5th 113.",

No action or proceeding shall be commenced against any state agency or political subdivision by any person claiming an interest in property acquired or held by a state agency or political subdivision unless such action is brought within three years from the date such person was first entitled to reclaim his interest in the property, or if the right to reclaim such property has occurred prior to the effective date of this section, within three years from the date such person was first entitled to reclaim his interest in the property or within six months after the effective date of this section, whichever date occurs later. For the purpose of this subsection, the date a person is entitled to reclaim his interest in the property is the date of abandonment of the use for which the property was taken.\n\nB. No action or proceeding shall be commenced pursuant to Section 42-1-23 NMSA 1978 [repealed] against any state agency or political subdivision by any person unless such action or proceeding is brought within three years from the date of the taking or damaging.\n\nC. Nothing in this section shall be construed as reviving any cause of action, extending any time limit or statute of limitations or creating any right of action.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 22-9-68, enacted by Laws 1974, ch. 59, § 1; 1980, ch. 20, § 2; 1978 Comp., § 42-1-40; recompiled as § 42A-1-31 by Laws 1981, ch. 125, § 60.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nLaws 1981, ch. 125, § 62 repealed 42-1-23 NMSA 1978. Laws 1981, ch. 125, § 61 provided that all references to 42-1-23 NMSA 1978 shall be construed as references to 42A-1-29 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1980 amendmentdeleted \"reversionary\" preceding, and \"real\" following, \"interest in\" near the beginning of the first sentence, deleted \"in fee simple determinable acquired through the exercise of the power of eminent domain\" following \"political subdivision\" near the middle of the first sentence, added Subsection B and redesignated former Subsection B and present Subsection C.\n\nRetroactivity of statute.— The statute of limitations created by this section may be applied retroactively to bar claims arising before enactment of the statute as long as the plaintiff was given a reasonable time within which to bring his action.Townsend v. State ex rel. State Hwy. Dep't, 1994-NMSC-014, 117 N.M. 302, 871 P.2d 958.\n\nApplicability of Subsection B.— Since the plaintiff is not bringing an action to \"reclaim\" an interest in the property because the state has never legally acquired or held it, he is claiming that the property has been taken or damaged without just compensation by the state removing gravel under a mineral lease. Therefore, the limitations period established by Subsection B of this section is applicable to these proceedings.Townsend v. State ex rel. State Hwy. Dep't, 1994-NMSC-014, 117 N.M. 302, 871 P.2d 958.\n\nSuccessive injuries.— In inverse condemnation cases, the traditional common-law rules apply to the accrual of the statute of limitations: a new and separate action arises with each new injury.Valdez v. Mountain Bell Tel. Co., 1988-NMCA-039, 107 N.M. 236, 755 P.2d 80.\n\nIndependent cause of actions.— A new cause of action arose each time the highway department removed sand and gravel. Therefore, a permanent taking occurred each time the character of rocks was changed by blasting and each time a truck left the property loaded with sand or gravel. As each cause of action arose, the statute of limitations began to run as to that cause alone.Townsend v. State ex rel. State Hwy. Dep't, 1994-NMSC-014, 117 N.M. 302, 871 P.2d 958.\n\nAm.
