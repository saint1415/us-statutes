The amount of the financial assurance shall be sufficient to assure the completion of the performance requirements of the permit, including closure and reclamation, if the work has to be performed by the director or a third-party contractor and shall include periodic review to account for any inflationary increases and anticipated changes in reclamation or closure costs. The regulations shall specify that financial requirements shall neither duplicate nor be less comprehensive than the federal financial requirements. The form and amount of the financial assurance shall be subject to the approval of the director as part of the permit application; provided that financial assurance does not include any type or variety of self-guarantee or self-insurance;\n\nR. require by regulation that the permittee may file an application with the director for the release of all or part of the permittee's financial assurance. The application shall describe the reclamation measures completed and shall contain an estimate of the costs of reclamation measures that have not been completed. Prior to release of any portion of the permittee's financial assurance, the director shall conduct an inspection and evaluation of the reclamation work involved. The director shall notify persons who have requested advance notice of the inspection. Interested members of the public shall be allowed to be present at the inspection of the reclamation work by the director.\n\n(1) The director may release in whole or in part the financial assurance if the reclamation covered by the financial assurance has been accomplished as required by the New Mexico Mining Act; provided that the director shall retain financial assurance at least equal to the approved estimated costs of completing reclamation measures that have not been completed; and provided further that for revegetated areas, the director shall retain the amount of financial assurance necessary for a third party to reestablish vegetation for a period of twelve years after the last year of augmented seeding, fertilizing, irrigation or other work, unless a post-mining land use is achieved that is inconsistent with the further need for revegetation. For new mining operations only, no part of the financial assurance necessary for a third party to reestablish vegetation shall be released so long as the lands to which the release would be applicable are contributing suspended solids above background levels to streamflow of intermittent and perennial streams.\n\n(2) A person with an interest that is or will be adversely affected by release of the financial assurance may file, with the director within thirty days of the date of the inspection, written objections to the proposed release from financial assurance. If written objections are filed and a hearing is requested, the director shall inform all the interested parties of the time and place of the hearing at least thirty days in advance of the public hearing, and hold a public hearing in the locality of the new or existing mining operation or exploration operation proposed for release from financial assurance. The date, time and location of the public hearing shall be advertised by the director in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality for two consecutive weeks, and all persons who have submitted a written request in advance to the director to receive notices of hearings shall be provided notice at least thirty days prior to the hearing;\n\nS. establish coordinated procedures that avoid duplication for the inspection, monitoring and sampling of air, soil and water and enforcement of applicable requirements of the New Mexico Mining Act, regulations adopted pursuant to that act and permit conditions for new and existing mining operations and exploration. The regulations shall require, at a minimum:\n\n(1) inspections by the director occurring on an irregular basis according to the following schedule:\n\n(a) at least one inspection per month when the mining operation is conducting significant reclamation activities;\n\n(b) at least two inspections per year for active mining operations;\n\n(c) at least one inspection per year on inactive sites;\n\n(d) at least one inspection per year following completion of all significant reclamation activities, but prior to release of financial assurance; and\n\n(e) mining operations having a minimal impact on the environment and exploration operations will be inspected on a schedule to be established by the commission;\n\n(2) that inspections shall occur without prior notice to the permittee or the permittee's agents or employees except for necessary on-site meetings with the permittee;\n\n(3) when the director determines that a condition or practice exists that violates a requirement of the New Mexico Mining Act, a regulation adopted pursuant to that act or a permit issued under that act, which condition, practice or violation also creates an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or will cause significant imminent environmental harm, that the director shall immediately order a cessation of the new or existing mining operation or the exploration operation or the portion of that operation relevant to the condition, practice or violation. The cessation order shall remain in effect until the director determines that the condition, practice or violation has been abated or until modified, vacated or terminated by the director or the commission;\n\n(4) when the director determines that an owner or operator is in violation of a requirement of the New Mexico Mining Act, a regulation adopted pursuant to that act or a permit issued pursuant to that act but the violation does not create an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or will not cause significant imminent environmental harm, that the director shall issue a notice to the owner or operator fixing a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty days, for the abatement of the violation. If, upon expiration of the period of time as originally fixed or subsequently extended for good cause shown, the director finds that the violation has not been abated, the director shall immediately order a cessation of new or existing mining operations or exploration operations or the portion thereof relevant to the violation. The cessation order shall remain in effect until the director determines that the violation has been abated; and\n\n(5) when the director determines that a pattern of violations of the requirements of the New Mexico Mining Act or of the regulations adopted pursuant to that act or the permit required by that act exists or has existed and, if the director also finds that such violations are caused by the unwarranted failure of the owner or operator to comply with the requirements of that act, regulation or permit or that such violations are willfully caused by the owner or operator, that the director shall immediately issue an order to the owner or operator to show cause as to why the permit should not be suspended or revoked;\n\nT. provide for the transfer of a permit to a successor operator, providing for release of the first operator from obligations under the permit, including financial assurance, following the approved assumption of such obligations and financial assurance by the successor operator;\n\nU. adopt regulations providing that the owner or operator of an existing mining operation or a new mining operation who has completed some reclamation measures prior to the effective date of the regulations adopted pursuant to the New Mexico Mining Act may apply for an inspection of those reclamation measures and a release from further requirements pursuant to that act for the reclaimed areas if, after an inspection, the director determines that the reclamation measures satisfy the requirements of that act and the substantive requirements for reclamation pursuant to the applicable regulatory standards; and\n\nV. develop and adopt other regulations necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes and provisions of the New Mexico Mining Act.\n\nHistory:Laws 1993, ch. 315, § 7; 1997, ch. 88, § 2; 2014, ch. 32, § 2.\n\nThe 2014 amendment,effective March 7, 2014, eliminated the restriction on the release of financial assurances; in Subsection H, Paragraph (2), at the beginning of the sentence, deleted \"assure\" and added \"ensure\"; in Subsection H, Paragraph (8), after \"contamination and\", deleted \"assure\" and added \"ensure\"; and in Subsection R, deleted the former second sentence which provided that a permittee could not apply for release of financial assurance more that once per year for each mining operation.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective June 20, 1997, in the introductory language of Subsection A, substituted \"before June 18, 1994\" for \"within one year of the effective date of the New Mexico Mining Act\" at the beginning and \"the provisions of the New Mexico Mining Act\" for \"that Act\" near the end; in Subsection K, in the introductory language, added the second sentence and inserted \"at the time of the filing of the application with the director\" and \"and of the procedure for requesting a public hearing\" in the last sentence, made a minor stylistic change in Paragraph (4), added \"of this application; and\" in Paragraph (5), and added Paragraph (6); and, in Subsection S, rewrote Paragraph (1).\n\nConstitutionality of regulations.— Regulations that did not establish a schedule of fees but provided that almost all fees be set on a case-by-case basis were invalid insofar as they did not set a determinate fee.Old Abe Co. v. N.M. Mining Comm'n, 1995-NMCA-134, 121 N.M. 83, 908 P.2d 776, 120 N.M. 828, 907 P.2d 1009.\n\nRegulations were not impermissibly vague and could not delegate an unbridled discretion in the director, in view of the provisions for both administrative and judicial review of actions of the director, and therefore did not violate due process.Old Abe Co. v. N.M. Mining Comm'n, 1995-NMCA-134, 121 N.M. 83, 908 P.2d 776, 120 N.M. 828, 907 P.2d 1009.\n\nRegulations granting power to the director, an employee of the commission, were not violative of the separation of powers doctrine.Old Abe Co. v. N.M. Mining Comm'n, 1995-NMCA-134, 121 N.M. 83, 908 P.2d 776, 120 N.M. 828, 907 P.2d 1009.\n\nThe provision authorizing the imposition of fees by the commission did not violate the constitutional prohibition against the imposition of fees by a nonelective body, since the commission is not a political subdivision.Old Abe Co. v. N.M. Mining Comm'n, 1995-NMCA-134, 121 N.M. 83, 908 P.2d 776, 120 N.M. 828, 907 P.2d 1009.\n\nA definition of \"mining\" that classified mining operations into different categories did not violate the dictates of equal protection.Old Abe Co. v. N.M. Mining Comm'n, 1995-NMCA-134, 121 N.M. 83, 908 P.2d 776, 120 N.M. 828, 907 P.2d 1009.\n\nRulemaking authority.— The commission had authority to adopt a rule imposing a surcharge on certain fees promulgated by it in order to partially reimburse the department of game and fish for assistance in implementing the State Mining Act.N.M. Mining Ass'n v. N.M. Mining Comm'n, 1996-NMCA-098, 122 N.M. 332, 924 P.2d 741.\n\nFee not a tax.— A surcharge imposed on certain fees for the purpose of reimbursing the department of game and fish for assisting in implementing the State Mining Act was a fee, not a tax.N.M. Mining Ass'n v. N.M. Mining Comm'n, 1996-NMCA-098, 122 N.M. 332, 924 P.2d 741.\n\nTransfer of funds.— Nothing in the Mining Act, the Wildlife Conservation Act (17-2-37 to 17-2-46 NMSA 1978), or other state laws prohibit the transfer of funds derived from fees imposed by the commission to the department of game and fish to assist in implementing the Mining Act.N.M. Mining Ass'n v. N.M. Mining Comm'n, 1996-NMCA-098, 122 N.M. 332, 924 P.2d 741.\n\nDiscretion.— New Mexico mining commission acted within its discretion in ruling that the El Cajete mine was a new mining unit of the Las Conchas mine, rather than a new mining operation; the mines were owned by the same mining company and were substantially interrelated.Rio Grande Chapter of Sierra Club v. N.M. Mining Comm'n, 2003-NMSC-005, 133 N.M. 97, 61 P.3d 806.",

Upon the forfeiture of some or all of the financial assurance attributable to a specific reclamation project or closeout plan, the director shall determine whether such reclamation project or closeout plan will exceed a duration of five years from the date of the forfeiture. Each amount credited to the mining act forfeiture fund for a reclamation project or closeout plan that exceeds five years pursuant to the director's determination shall be held in a separate account of the mining act forfeiture fund for the sole benefit of that reclamation project or closeout plan and may be invested by the state investment council with the advice of an independent investment advisor hired by the energy, minerals and natural resources department. Income from the mining act forfeiture fund shall be credited to the fund; provided that the income attributable to each source of forfeited financial assurance may be used only for the benefit of the specific reclamation project or closure plan, or portions thereof, to which the forfeited financial assurance applies. Disbursements from the mining act forfeiture fund shall be made upon warrants drawn by the secretary of finance and administration pursuant to vouchers signed by the secretary of energy, minerals and natural resources.
