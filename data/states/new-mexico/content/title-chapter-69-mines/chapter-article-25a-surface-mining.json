Any permittee who violates any permit condition or any person who violates any provision of the Surface Mining Act may be assessed a civil penalty by the director, except that if such violation leads to the issuance of a cessation order under Section 25 [69-25A-25 NMSA 1978] of the Surface Mining Act, the civil penalty shall be assessed. Such penalty shall not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each violation. Each day of continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation for purposes of penalty assessments. In determining the amount of the penalty, consideration shall be given to:\n\n(1) the permittee's history of previous violations at the particular surface coal mining operation;\n\n(2) the seriousness of the violation, including any irreparable harm to the environment and any hazard to the health or safety of the public;\n\n(3) whether the permittee was negligent; and\n\n(4) the demonstrated good faith of the permittee charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation.\n\nB. A civil penalty shall be assessed by the director only after the person charged with a violation described under Subsection A of this section has been given an opportunity for a public hearing. Where such a public hearing has been held, the director shall make findings of fact, and shall issue a written decision as to the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty which is warranted, incorporating, when appropriate, an order therein requiring that the penalty be paid. When appropriate, the director shall consolidate such hearings with other proceedings under Section 25 [69-25A-25 NMSA 1978] of the Surface Mining Act. Any hearing under this section shall be of record and adjudicatory in accordance with commission regulations. Where the person charged with such a violation fails to avail himself of the opportunity for a public hearing, a civil penalty shall be assessed by the director after the director has determined that a violation did occur, and the amount of the penalty which is warranted, and has issued an order requiring that the penalty be paid.\n\nC. Upon the issuance of a notice or order charging that a violation of the Surface Mining Act has occurred, the director shall inform the operator within thirty days of the proposed amount of the penalty. The person charged with the penalty shall then have thirty days to pay the proposed penalty in full or, if the person wishes to contest either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation, forward the proposed amount to the director for placement in an escrow account. If through administrative or judicial review of the proposed penalty, it is determined that no violation occurred, or that the amount to the director for placement in an escrow account. If through administrative or judicial review of the proposed penalty, it is determined that no violation occurred, or that the amount of the penalty should be reduced, the director shall within thirty days remit the appropriate amount to the person, with interest at the rate of six percent per annum, or at the prevailing United States department of the treasury rate, whichever is greater. Failure to forward the money to the director within thirty days shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty.\n\nD. Civil penalties owed under the Surface Mining Act may be recovered in a civil action brought by the attorney general at the request of the director in the district court of the county where the violation occurred.\n\nE.

      "text": "A. The permittee may file a request with the director for the release of all or part of a performance bond or deposit. Within thirty days after any application for bond or deposit release has been filed with the director, the operator shall submit a copy of an advertisement placed at least once a week for four successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality of the surface coal mining operation. Such advertisement shall be considered part of any bond release application and shall contain a notification of the precise location of the land affected, the number of acres, the permit and the date approved, the amount of the bond filed and the portion sought to be released, and the type and appropriate dates of reclamation work performed, and a description of the results achieved as they relate to the operator's approved reclamation plan. In addition, as part of any bond release application, the applicant shall submit copies of letters which he has sent to adjoining property owners, local governmental bodies, planning agencies and sewage and water treatment authorities or water companies in the locality in which the surface coal mining and reclamation activities took place, notifying them of his intention to seek release from the bond.\n\nB. Upon receipt of the notification and request, the director shall within thirty days conduct an inspection an evaluation of the reclamation work involved. Such evaluation shall consider, among other things, the degree of difficulty to complete any remaining reclamation, whether pollution of surface and subsurface water is occurring, the probability of continuance or future occurrence of such pollution and the estimated cost of abating such pollution. The director shall notify the permittee in writing of his decision to release or not to release all or part of the performance bond or deposit within sixty days from the filing of the request, if no public hearing is held pursuant to Subsection F of this section, and if there has been a public hearing held pursuant thereto, within thirty days thereafter.\n\nC. The director may release in whole or in part the bond or deposit if he is satisfied the reclamation covered by the bond or deposit or portion thereof has been accomplished as required by the Surface Mining Act according to the following schedule:\n\n(1) when the operator completes the backfilling, regrading and drainage control of a bonded area in accordance with his approved reclamation plan, the release of sixty percent of the bond or collateral for the applicable permit area;\n\n(2) after revegetation has been established on the regraded mined lands in accordance with the approved reclamation plan. When determining the amount of bond to be released after successful revegetation has been established, the director shall retain that amount of the bond for the revegetated area which would be sufficient for a third party to cover the cost of reestablishing revegetation and for the period specified for operator responsibility in Section 19 [69-25A-19 NMSA 1978] of the Surface Mining Act for reestablishing revegetation. No part of the bond or deposit shall be released under this paragraph so long as the lands to which the release would be applicable are contributing suspended solids to streamflow or runoff outside the permit area in excess of the requirements set by Section 19 of that act or until soil productivity for prime farmlands has returned to equivalent levels of yield as non-minded land of the same soil type in the surrounding area under equivalent management practices as determined from the soil survey performed pursuant to Section 10 [69-25A-10 NMSA 1978] of that act. Where a silt dam is to be retained as a permanent impoundment pursuant to Section 19 of that act, the portion of bond which relates to reclamation of the silt dam may be released under this section so long as provisions for sound future maintenance by the operator or the landowner have been made with the director;\n\n(3) when the operator has completed successfully all surface coal mining and reclamation activities, the release of the remaining portion of the bond, but not before the expiration of the period specified for operator responsibility in Section 19 of the Surface Mining Act. Provided, that no bond shall be fully released until all reclamation requirements of that act are fully met.\n\nD. If the director disapproves the application for release of the bond or portion thereof, the director shall notify the permittee, in writing, stating the reasons for disapproval and recommending corrective actions necessary to secure the release and allowing opportunity for a public hearing.\n\nE. When any application for total or partial bond release is filed with the director, the director shall notify the municipality, if any, in which the surface coal mining operation is located by certified mail at least thirty days prior to the release of all or a portion of the bond.\n\nF. Any person with a valid legal interest which might be adversely affected by release of the bond or the responsible officer or head of any federal, state and local governmental agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental, social or economic impact involved in the operation, or is authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards with respect to such operations shall have the right to file written objections to the proposed release from bond to the director within thirty days after the last publication of the notice pursuant to Subsection A of this section. If written objections are filed and a hearing is requested, the director shall inform all the interested parties of the time and place of the hearing, and hold a public hearing in the locality of the surface coal mining operation proposed for bond release within thirty days of the request for such hearing. The date, time and location of such public hearing shall be advertised by the director in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality for two consecutive weeks, and shall hold a public hearing in the locality of the surface coal mining operation proposed for bond release or at Santa Fe at the option of the objector, within thirty days of the request for such hearing.\n\nG. Without prejudice to the rights of the objectors, the applicant or the responsibilities of the director pursuant to this section, the director may establish an informal conference as provided in Section 17 [69-25A-17 NMSA 1978] of the Surface Mining Act to resolve such written objections.\n\nH. For the purpose of such hearing, the director shall have the authority and is hereby empowered to administer oaths, subpoena witnesses or written or printed materials, compel the attendance of witnesses or production of the materials and take evidence including but not limited to inspections of the land affected and other surface coal mining operations carried on by the applicant in the general vicinity. A verbatim record of each public hearing required by the Surface Mining Act shall be made, and a transcript made available on the motion of any party or by order of the director.\n\nHistory:Laws 1979, ch. 291, § 23.",

By regulation, the commission shall establish a planning process for objectively determining which, if any, additional land areas are unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining, based upon competent and scientifically sound data and information. The process shall include:\n\n(1) a data base and an inventory system which will permit proper evaluation of the capacity of different land areas of the state to support and permit reclamation of surface coal mining operations;\n\n(2) a method for implementing land use planning decisions concerning surface coal mining operations so that determinations of the unsuitability of land for surface coal mining will be integrated as closely as possible with present and future land use planning and regulation processes at the federal, state and local levels; and\n\n(3) proper notice and opportunities for public participation, including a public hearing prior to making any designation or redesignation.\n\nC. Any person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected may petition the director to have an area designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations, or to have such a designation terminated. The petition shall contain allegations of facts with supporting evidence which would tend to establish the allegations. Within ten months after receipt of the petition, the director shall hold a public hearing in the locality of the affected area, after appropriate notice and publication of the date, time and location of the hearing. After an interested person has filed a petition and before the hearing, any person may intervene by filing allegations of facts with supporting evidence which would tend to establish the allegations. Within sixty days after the hearing, the director shall issue and furnish to the petitioner and any other party to the hearing, a written decision regarding the petition, and the reasons therefor. In the event that all the petitioners stipulate agreement prior to the requested hearing and withdraw their request, the hearing need not be held.\n\nD. Prior to designating any land areas as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations, the director shall prepare a detailed statement on:\n\n(1) the potential coal resources of the area;\n\n(2) the demand for coal resources; and\n\n(3) the impact of such designation on the environment, the economy and the supply of coal.\n\nE. Upon petition pursuant to Subsection C of this section, the director, pursuant to the commission's regulations:\n\n(1) shall designate an area as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations if he determines that reclamation pursuant to the requirements of the Surface Mining Act is not technologically and economically feasible; and\n\n(2) may designate an area as unsuitable for certain types of surface coal mining operations if he determines that such operations will:\n\n(a) be incompatible with existing state or local land use plans or programs;\n\n(b) affect fragile or historic lands in which such operations could result in significant damage to important historic, cultural, scientific and esthetic values and natural systems;\n\n(c) affect renewable resource lands in which such operations could result in a substantial loss or reduction of long-range productivity of water supply or of food or fiber products, and such lands to include aquifers and aquifer recharge areas; or\n\n(d) affect natural hazard lands in which such operations could substantially endanger life and property, such lands to include areas subject to frequent flooding and areas of unstable geology.\n\nF. The requirements of this section do not apply:\n\n(1) to lands on which surface coal mining operations were being conducted on August 3, 1977;\n\n(2) to lands on which surface coal mining operations are being conducted under a permit issued pursuant to the Surface Mining Act; or\n\n(3) where substantial legal and financial commitments in surface coal mining operations were in existence prior to January 4, 1977.\n\nG. The designation of lands as unsuitable for mining pursuant to this section shall not prevent the mineral exploration pursuant to the Surface Mining Act of any area so designated.\n\nHistory:Laws 1979, ch. 291, § 26.\n\nCross references.— For regulation of lands affected by mining \"hard rock\" minerals,seeChapter 69, Article 36 NMSA 1978.",

Upon receipt of the application, the director shall cause such investigation to be made as the director deems appropriate. The investigation shall provide an opportunity for a public hearing, at the request of the permittee or the person having an interest that is or may be adversely affected, to enable the permittee or the person to present information relating to the issuance and continuance of the notice or order or the modification, vacation or termination of the notice or order.

Following the issuance of an order to show cause as to why a permit should not be suspended or revoked pursuant to Section 69-25A-25 NMSA 1978, the director shall hold a public hearing after giving written notice of the time, place and date of the hearing. Any hearing shall be of record and adjudicatory in nature in accordance with the commission's rules. Within sixty days following the public hearing, the director shall issue and furnish to the permittee and all other parties to the hearing a written decision, and the reasons for the decision, concerning suspension or revocation of the permit. If the director revokes the permit, the permittee shall immediately cease surface coal mining operations on the permit area and complete reclamation within a period specified by the director, or the director shall declare as forfeited the performance bonds for the operation.
