New Mexico has now reached the stage where future exploitation of minerals must proceed on the basis of the intensive application of modern technology. The immediate need is for the assembly of known data on mineral resources by mineral resource economists in order to make it possible to point to the areas offering the highest probability of successful exploitation of these resources.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 63-33-2, enacted by Laws 1967, ch. 254, § 2.\n\nAm.
