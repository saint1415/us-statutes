Except as provided in Subsection B of this section, Sections 53 through 72 of the Condominium Act apply to all units restricted to residential use subject to that act [47-7A-1 through 47-7D-20 NMSA 1978].\n\nB. Neither a disclosure statement nor a resale certificate need be prepared or delivered in the case of:\n\n(1) a gratuitous disposition of a unit;\n\n(2) a disposition pursuant to court order;\n\n(3) a disposition by a government or governmental agency;\n\n(4) a disposition by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure;\n\n(5) a disposition to a person in the business of selling real estate who intends to offer those units to purchasers;\n\n(6) a disposition that may be canceled at any time and for any reason by the purchaser without penalty;\n\n(7) a disposition to a nonresident alien; or\n\n(8) a disposition of a unit restricted to nonresidential use.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 53.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 4-101 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exceptions: Subsection A of this section of the state Condominium Act deletes the language of subsection (a) of § 4-101 of the Uniform Condominium Act, providing for waiver or modification of the protections of this article in condominiums where all units are restricted to nonresidential use; \"disclosure\" is substituted for \"public offering\" in the introductory paragraph of Subsection B of this section of the state Condominium Act; and Paragraphs (7) and (8) of Subsection B of this section of the state Condominium Act are not contained in subsection (b) of § 4-101 of the Uniform Condominium Act.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\nIn the case of commercial and industrial condominiums, the purchaser is often more sophisticated than the purchaser of residential units and thus better able to bargain for the protections he believes necessary. While this may not always be true, no objective test can be developed which easily distinguishes those commercial purchasers who are able to protect themselves from those who, in the ordinary course of business, have not developed such sophistication. At the same time, the cost of protection imposed by Article 4 [this article] may be substantial. Accordingly, subsection (a) [Subsection A] permits waiver or modification of Article 4 [this article] protections in condominiums where all units are restricted to non-residential use, e.g., in the case of most commercial and industrial condominiums. However, except for certain waivers of implied warranties of quality (see § 4-115 [not adopted]) and certain exemptions from public offering statement and resale certificate requirements (see subsection (b) [Subsection B]), no express waiver of the protections of this article with respect to the purchasers of residential units is permitted by this subsection. Accordingly, by operation of § 1-104 [47-7A-4 NMSA 1978], the rights provided by this article may not be waived in the case of residential purchasers. Moreover, because of the interrelated rights of residential and commercial owners in mixed-use condominiums, waiver or modification of rights conferred by this article is restricted to purchasers in wholly nonresidential condominiums.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The reference to \"Sections 53 through 72 of the Condominium Act\" in Subsection A seems incorrect, as the Condominium Act contains only 69 sections. Sections 53 to 69 of the Condominium Act are compiled as 47-7A-2, 47-7D-1 to 47-7D-12, 47-7D-17 to 47-7D-20 NMSA 1978.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 15A Am.

      "text": "A. Except as provided in Subsection B of this section, prior to the offering of any interest in a unit to the public, a declarant shall prepare a disclosure statement conforming to the requirements of Sections 55 through 58 [47-7D-3 to 47-7D-6 NMSA 1978] of the Condominium Act.\n\nB. A declarant may transfer responsibility for preparation of all or part of the disclosure statement to a successor declarant or to a person in the business of selling real estate who intends to offer units in the condominium for his own account. In the event of any such transfer, the transferor shall provide the transferee with any information necessary to enable the transferee to fulfill the requirements of Subsection A of this section. The transferor is not liable for insuring that the transferee complies with the requirements of Sections 55 through 58 [47-7D-3 to 47-7D-6 NMSA 1978] of the Condominium Act.\n\nC. Any declarant or other person in the business of selling real estate who offers a unit for his own account to a purchaser shall deliver a disclosure statement in the manner prescribed in Subsection A of Section 60 [47-7D-8 NMSA 1978] of the Condominium Act. The declarant or any other person specified in Subsection B of this section who prepared all or part of the disclosure statement is liable under Sections 60 and 69 [65] [47-7D-8, 47-7D-17 NMSA 1978] of that act for any false or misleading statement set forth therein or for any omission of material fact therefrom with respect to that portion of the disclosure statement which he prepared. If a declarant did not prepare any part of a disclosure statement that he delivers, he is not liable for any false or misleading statement set forth therein or for any omission of material fact therefrom unless he had actual knowledge of the statement or omission or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the statement or omission.\n\nD. If a unit is part of a condominium and is part of any other real estate regime in connection with the sale of which the delivery of a disclosure statement is required under the laws of this state, a single disclosure statement conforming to the requirements of Sections 55 through 58 [47-7D-3 to 47-7D-6 NMSA 1978] of the Condominium Act as those requirements relate to all real estate regimes in which the unit is located, and to any other requirements imposed under the laws of this state, may be prepared and delivered in lieu of providing two or more disclosure statements.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 54.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For Real Estate Disclosure Act, see ch. 47, art. 13 NMSA 1978.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 4-102 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exceptions: \"disclosure\" is substituted for \"public offering\" throughout the section; the third sentence of Subsection B of this section of the state Condominium Act has been added; and \"declarant or any other person specified in Subsection B of this section\" is substituted for \"person\" in the second sentence of Subsection C of this section of the state Condominium Act.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\nThis section permits declarants to transfer responsibility for preparation of a public offering statement to successor declarants or dealers, provided the declarant furnishes the information needed by the successor or dealer to complete the statement. The person who prepares the public offering statement is liable for his own misrepresentations and material omissions. A person who delivers a public offering statement prepared by others is responsible for any such deficiencies only to the extent he knows or reasonably should have known of them.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The reference to \"Sections . . . 69 of that act\" in the second sentence in Subsection C seems incorrect, as that section of the Condominium Act appears as 47-7A-2 NMSA 1978, which deals with applicability. Section 65 of the Condominium Act, which appears as 47-7D-17 NMSA 1978, deals with the effect of violations.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 15A Am.

If a condominium composed of not more than twenty-five units is not subject to any development rights and no power is reserved to a declarant to make the condominium part of a larger condominium, group of condominiums or other real estate, a public offering statement may but need not include the information otherwise required by Paragraphs (9), (10) and (15) through (17) of Subsection A of this section.\n\nC. A declarant promptly shall amend the disclosure statement to report any material change in the information required by this section.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 55.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 4-103 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exceptions: \"disclosure\" is substituted for \"public offering\" throughout Subsections A and C of this section of the state Condominium Act; \"and a brief narrative description of the significant features\" is deleted following \"copies\" near the beginning of Subsection A(4) of this section of the state Condominium Act; \"seven\" is substituted for \"15\" in Paragraphs (11)(a) and (11)(d) of Subsection A of this section of the state Condominium Act; Paragraph (11)(b) of Subsection A of this section of the state Condominium Act substitutes \"rescind the purchase within six months from the date of conveyance\" for \"recover from the declarant (10) percent of the sales price of the unit,\" as it appears in paragraph (11)(ii) of subsection (a) of § 4-103 of the Uniform Condominium Act; Paragraph (11)(c) of Subsection A of this section of the state Condominium Act is inserted; Paragraph (17) of that same subsection refers to \"Section 21 [47-7B-9 NMSA 1978] of the Condominium Act,\" which is comparable to § 2-109 of the Uniform Condominium Act, while paragraph (17) of subsection (a) of § 4-103 of the Uniform Condominium Act refers to \"Section 4-119\" of that act; paragraphs (18) and (19) of subsection (a) of § 4-103 of the Uniform Condominium Act, relating to zoning descriptions and other material circumstances, respectively, are deleted, as are references thereto in subsection (b) of § 4-103 of that act; \"twenty-five\" is substituted for \"12\" in Subsection B of this section of the state Condominium Act; and \"and the narrative descriptions of documents required by paragraph (a)(4)\" is deleted at the end of Subsection B of this section of the state Condominium Act.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. The best \"consumer protection\" that the law can provide to any purchaser is to insure that he has an opportunity to acquire an understanding of the nature of the products which he is purchasing. Such a result is difficult to achieve, however, in the case of the condominium purchaser because of the complex nature of the bundle of rights and obligations which each unit owner obtains. For this reason, the act, adopting the approach of many so-called \"second generation\" condominium statutes, sets forth a lengthy list of information which must be provided to each purchaser before he contracts for a unit. This list includes a number of important matters not typically required in public offering statements under existing law. The requirement for providing the public offering statement appears in § 4-102(c) [47-7D-2C NMSA 1978], and § 4-108 [47-7D-8 NMSA 1978] provides purchasers with cancellation rights and imposes civil penalties upon declarants not complying with the public offering statement requirements of the act.\n\n2. Paragraph (a)(2) [Subsection A(2)] requires a general description of the condominium and, to the extent possible, the declarant's schedule for commencement and completion of construction for all building amenities that will comprise portions of the condominium. Under § 2-109 [47-7B-9 NMSA 1978], the declarant is obligated to label all improvements which may be made in the condominium as either \"MUST BE BUILT\" or \"NEED NOT BE BUILT.\" Under § 4-119 [47-7D-19 NMSA 1978], the declarant is obligated to complete all improvements labeled \"MUST BE BUILT.\" The estimated schedule of commencement and completion of construction dates provides a standard for judging whether a declarant has complied with the requirements of § 4-119 [47-7D-19 NMSA 1978].\n\n3. Paragraph [(a)] (4) [Subsection A(4)] requires the public offering statement to include copies of the declaration, bylaws and any rules and regulations of the condominium, as well as copies of any contracts or leases to be executed by the purchaser. In addition, the paragraph requires the public offering statement to include a brief narrative description of the significant features of those documents, as well as of any management contract, leases of recreational facilities and other sorts of contracts which may be subject to cancellation by the association after the period of declarant control expires, as provided in § 3-105 [47-7C-5 NMSA 1978]. This latter requirement is intended to encourage the preparation of brief summaries of all condominium documents in laymen's terms, i.e., the \"brief narrative description\" should be more than a simple explanation of what a declaration (or other document) is, but less than an extended legal analysis duplicating the contents of the documents themselves. The summary requirement is intended to alleviate the common problem of public offering statements being drafted in lawyers' terms and being no more comprehensible to laymen than the documents themselves.\n\n4. The disclosure requirement of paragraph [(a)] (6) [Subsection A(6)] is intended to eliminate the common deceptive sales practice known as \"lowballing,\" a practice by which a declarant intentionally underestimates the budget for the association by providing many of the services himself during the initial sales period. In such a circumstance, the declarant commonly intends that, after a certain time, these services (which might include lawn maintenance, painting, security, bookkeeping or other services) will become expenses of the association, thereby substantially increasing the periodic common expense assessments which association members must ultimately bear. By requiring the disclosure of these services (including the projected common expense assessment attributable to each) in paragraph [(a)] (6) [Subsection A(6)], the act seeks to minimize \"lowballing\". In order to comply fully with the provisions of paragraph [(a)] (5) [Subsection A(5)], the declarant must calculate the budget on the basis of his best estimate of the number of units which will be part of the condominium during that budget year. This requirement as well operates to negate the effects of any attempted \"lowballing.\"\n\n5. Paragraph [(a)] (9) [Subsection A(9)] requires disclosure of any financing \"offered\" by the declarant. The paragraph contemplates that a declarant disclose any arrangements for financing that may have been made, including arrangements with any unaffiliated lender to provide mortgages to qualified purchasers.\n\n6. Under paragraph [(a)] (10) [Subsection A(10)], the declarant is required to disclose the terms of all warranties provided by the declarant (including the statutory warranties set forth in § 4-114 [not adopted]) and to describe any significant limitations on such warranties, the enforcement thereof or damages which may be collectible as a result of a breach thereof. This latter requirement would necessitate a description by the declarant of any exclusions or modifications of statutory warranties undertaken pursuant to § 4-115 [not adopted]. The statute of limitations for warranties set forth in § 4-116 [not adopted], together with any separate written agreement (as required by § 4-116 [not adopted]) providing for reduction of the period of such statute of limitations, must also be disclosed.\n\n7. Paragraph [(a)] (14) [Subsection A(14)] requires that the declarant disclose the existence of any right of first refusal or other restrictions on the uses for which or classes of persons to whom units may be sold.\n\n8. Paragraph [(a)] (15) [Subsection A(15)] corrects a defect common to many condominium statutes by requiring the declarant to describe the insurance coverage provided for the benefit of unit owners. See § 3-113 [47-7C-13 NMSA 1978].\n\n9. Under paragraph [(a)] (16) [Subsection A(16)], the declarant is obligated to disclose any current or expected fees or charges which unit owners may be required to pay for the use of the common elements and other facilities related to the condominium. Such fees or charges might include swimming pool fees, golf course fees or required membership fees for recreation associations. Such fees are often not disclosed to condominium purchasers and can represent a substantial addition to their monthly assessments.\n\n10. The \"financial arrangements\" required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph [(a)] (17) [Subsection A(17)] may vary substantially from one condominium development to another. It is the intent of the paragraph to give purchasers as much information as possible with which to assess the declarant's ability to carry out his obligations to complete the improvements. For example, if a declarant has a commitment from a bank to provide construction financing for a swimming pool when 50% of the units in the condominium are completed, that fact should be disclosed to potential purchasers.\n\n11. In addition to the information required to be disclosed by paragraphs [(a)] (1) through (18) [Subsections A(1) to A(17)], paragraph [(a)] (19) requires that the declarant disclose all other \"unusual and material circumstances, features, and characteristics\" of the condominium and all units therein. This requires only information which is both \"unusual and material.\" Thus, the provision does not require the disclosure of \"material\" factors which are commonly understood to be part of the condominium, e.g., the fact that a condominium has a roof, walls, doors and windows. Similarly, the provision does not require the disclosure of \"unusual\" information about the condominium which is not also \"material,\" e.g., the fact that a condominium is the first condominium in a particular community. Information which would normally be required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph [(a)] (19) might include, to the extent that they are unusual and material, environmental conditions affecting the use or enjoyment of the condominium, features of the location of the condominium, e.g., near the end of an airport runway or a planned rendering plant and the like.\n\n12. The cost of preparing a public offering statement can be substantial and may, particularly in the case of small condominiums, represent a significant portion of the cost of a unit. For that reason, subsection (b) [Subsection B] permits a declarant to exclude from a public offering statement certain information in the case of a small condominium (i.e., less than 12 units) which is not subject to development rights and which is not potentially part of a larger condominium or group of condominiums. Essentially, subsection (b) [Subsection B] permits a declarant to exclude from a public offering statement those materials which, as a practical matter, require extended preparation effort by an attorney or engineer in addition to the normal effort which must be exerted to provide the declaration, bylaws, plats and plans or other documents required by the act.\n\nAm.

The purpose is to put the purchaser on notice of the extent to which the exercise of those rights may alter, sometimes quite dramatically, both the physical and the legal aspects of the project. For example, the prospective purchaser may be contemplating the acquisition of a particular unit because it enjoys a view of open, undeveloped land over which the declarant has, however, reserved development rights. It may be that the boundary of the parcel as to which development rights have been reserved actually coincides with, or runs quite close to, the outer wall of the unit in question. The disclosures or statements made pursuant to paragraphs (8) and (12) [Subsections H and K] of this section will indicate to the prospective purchaser the extent (if any) to which he can rely on the declarant not to do anything which would radically alter the view from the unit which he now finds so appealing.\n\nAm.

Time sharing has become increasingly important in recent years, particularly with respect to resort condominiums. In recognition of this fact, this section requires the disclosure of certain information with respect to time sharing.\n\n2. Virtually all existing state condominium statutes are silent with respect to time-share ownership. The inclusion of disclosure provisions for certain forms of time sharing in this act, however, does not imply that other law regulating time sharing is affected in any way in a state merely because that state enacts this act.\n\nThe Uniform Law Commissioners' Model Real Estate Time-Share Act specifies more extensive disclosures for time-share properties. A \"time-share property\" may include part or all of the condominium, and § 1-109 of the model act governs conflicts between this act and time-share legislation.\n\nAm.

In the case of a condominium containing one or more conversion buildings, the disclosure of additional information relating to the condition of those buildings is required in the public offering statement because of the difficulty inherent in a single purchaser attempting to determine the condition of what is likely to be an older building being renovated for the purpose of condominium sales.\n\n2. Paragraph (a)(1) [Subsection A(1)] requires the person who gives the public offering statement to retain an independent architect or engineer to report on the present condition of all structural components and fixed mechanical and electrical installations in the conversion building. Such information is as useful to declarant as to the purchaser since, under the implied warranty provisions of § 4-114 [not adopted], a declarant impliedly warrants all improvements made by any person to the building \"before creation of the condominium\" unless such improvements are specifically excluded from the implied warranty of quality pursuant to § 4-115(b) [not adopted].\n\n3. See Comment 6 to § 2-101 [47-7B-1 NMSA 1978] concerning the meaning of \"structural components\" as used in paragraph (a)(1) [Subsection A(1)]. Any material changes in the \"present condition\" of these systems must be reported by an amendment to the public offering statement.\n\n4. Under paragraph (a)(3) [Subsection A(2)], the person required to give the public offering statement is required to provide purchasers with a list of all outstanding notices of uncured violations of building codes or other municipal regulations. The literal wording of this provision does not require disclosure of known violations of such building codes or municipal regulations (at least violations having no effect upon the structural components or fixed mechanical and electrical installations of the condominium) unless actual \"notices\" of such violations have been received. To the extent that outstanding notices of uncured violations do exist, the cost of curing such violations would become a liability of the unit owners or the association following transfer of the unit to a purchaser. For that reason, the estimated cost of curing any outstanding violations must also be disclosed.\n\n5. For the same reasons set forth in the Comment to § 4-101(a) [47-7D-1A NMSA 1978], this section does not apply to units which are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The reference to \"Section 54 of the Condominium Act\" in Subsection A seems incorrect, as § 54, which appears as 47-7D-2 NMSA 1978, deals with liability for disclosure statement requirements. Section 55 of the Condominium Act, which appears as 47-7D-3 NMSA 1978, deals with the general information required in a disclosure statement.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 15A Am.

Some condominiums are regarded as \"investment contracts\" or other \"securities\"under federal law because they exhibit certain investment features such as mandatory rental pools. See SEC Securities Act Release No. 5347 (January 1973). The purpose of this section is to permit the declarant to file or deliver, in lieu of a public offering statement specifically prepared to comply with the provisions of this act, the prospectus filed with and distributed pursuant to the regulations of the United States securities and exchange commission. Absent this provision, prospective purchasers of condominiums classified by the SEC as \"securities\" would have to be given two public offering statements, one prepared pursuant to this act and the other prepared pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. § 77a et seq.]. Not only would this result increase the declarant's costs (and thus the price) of units, it might also reduce the likelihood of either public offering statement actually being read by prospective purchasers.\n\n2. The bracketed language in the first sentence of this section should be inserted by states which choose to adopt the agency provisions of Article 5 [not adopted] of the act. The second sentence should also be inserted by states opting to incorporate Article 5 [not adopted] of the act to avoid duplicative regulation of condominiums by the agency administering the state's securities regulation statutes.\n\nAm.

A person required to deliver a disclosure statement pursuant to Subsection C of Section 54 [47-7D-2 NMSA 1978] of the Condominium Act shall provide a purchaser of a unit with a copy of the disclosure statement and all amendments thereto before conveyance of that unit and not later than the date of any contract of sale. Unless a purchaser is given the disclosure statement more than seven days before execution of a contract for the purchase of a unit, the purchaser, before conveyance, may cancel the contract within seven days after first receiving the disclosure statement.\n\nB. If a purchaser elects to cancel a contract pursuant to Subsection A of this section, he may do so by hand-delivering notice thereof to the offerer or by mailing notice thereof by prepaid United States mail to the offerer or to his agent for service of process. Cancellation is without penalty, and all payments made by the purchaser before cancellation shall be refunded promptly.\n\nC. If a person required to deliver a disclosure statement pursuant to Subsection C of Section 54 of the Condominium Act fails to provide a purchaser to whom a unit is conveyed with that disclosure statement and all amendments thereto as required by Subsection A of this section, the purchaser is entitled to rescind the purchase within six months from the date of conveyance upon delivery to the seller of a deed subject to no encumbrance attaching to the property suffered or caused by the purchaser.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 60.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 4-108 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exceptions: \"disclosure\" is substituted for \"public offering\" throughout the section; \"seven\" is substituted for \"15\" in Subsection A of this section of the state Condominium Act; and at the end of Subsection C of this section of the state Condominium Act, the language beginning with \"is entitled to rescind\" is substituted for \"in addition to any rights to damages or other relief, is entitled to receive from that person an amount equal to [10] percent of the sales price of the unit,\" as it appears at the end of subsection (c) of § 4-108 of the Uniform Condominium Act.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. The \"cooling off\" period provided to a purchaser in this section is similar to provisions in many current state condominium statutes.\n\n2. Subsection (a) [Subsection A] requires that each purchaser be provided with both the public offering statement and all amendments thereto prior to the time that the unit is conveyed. If there is a contract for the sale of the unit, these documents must be provided not later than the date of the contract. The section makes clear that any amendments to the public offering statement prepared between the date of any contract and the date of conveyance must also be provided to the purchaser.\n\n3. This section does not require the delivery of a public offering statement prior to the execution by the purchaser of an agreement pursuant to which the purchaser reserves the right to buy a unit but is not contractually bound to do so. Because such agreements (frequently referred to as \"non-binding reservation agreements\") may be unilaterally cancelled at any time by a prospective purchaser without penalty, they do not constitute \"contract[s] of sale\" within the meaning of the section.\n\n4. The requirement set forth in subsection (a) [Subsection A] that a purchaser be provided with subsequent amendments to the public offering statement during the period between execution of the contract for purchase and conveyance of the unit does not, in itself, extend the \"cooling off\" period. Indeed, the delivery of such amendments is required even if the \"cooling off\" period has expired. The purpose of this requirement is to assure that purchasers of units are advised of any material change in the condominium which may affect their sales contracts under general law. While many such amendments will be merely technical and will not affect the bargain that the purchaser and declarant entered into, each purchaser should be permitted to judge for himself the materiality of any change in the nature of the condominium.\n\n5. Under the scheme set forth in this section, it is at least theoretically possible that there will be a contract for sale of the unit, and that a public offering statement will be given to the purchaser at closing just prior to conveyance. However, the available evidence suggests that such practice would be rare, and that the provision of a public offering statement moments prior to conveyance would, in itself, tend to dampen the enthusiasm of the purchaser for immediate closing. In such circumstances, under subsection (a) [Subsection A], the purchaser would, as a matter of right, be able to extend the date of closing for 15 days from the time the public offering statement was provided. This fact, together with the generally unsatisfactory experience with mandatory \"cooling off\" periods such as that imposed under the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act [12 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.], supports the conclusion that it is inappropriate to require a minimum period of delay between delivery of a public offering statement and conveyance.\n\n6. Under subsection (a) [Subsection A], the failure to deliver a public offering statement before conveyance does not result in a statutory right by the purchaser to cancel the conveyance or to reconvey the unit once conveyance has occurred. Any such cancellation or reconveyance right following an actual conveyance could create serious mechanical and title problems that could not be easily resolved. The failure of the act to provide for such cancellation or reconveyance is not, however, intended to diminish any right which a purchaser may otherwise have under general state law. For example, where it appears that a seller, by deliberately failing to disclose certain material information with respect to a transaction, substantially changed the bargain which he and the purchaser entered into, it is possible under the common law in some states that reconveyance would be an available remedy.\n\nEven absent such resort to general law, however, the penalty provisions of subsection (c) [Subsection C] are designed to provide a sufficient incentive to the seller to insure that the public offering statement is provided in the timely fashion required by the act. The penalty so specified in the subsection is in addition to any right a prevailing purchaser may have under § 4-117 [47-7D-17 NMSA 1978] to collect punitive damages and attorney's fees in connection with his action against the declarant.\n\nAm.

Except in the case of a sale where delivery of a disclosure statement is required, or unless exempt under Subsection B of Section 53 [47-7D-1 NMSA 1978] of the Condominium Act, a unit owner shall furnish to a purchaser before conveyance a copy of the declaration, other than the plats and plans, the bylaws, the rules or regulations of the association and a resale certificate from the association containing:\n\n(1) a statement disclosing the existence and terms of any right of first refusal or other restraint on the free alienability of the unit;\n\n(2) a statement setting forth the amount of the monthly common expense assessment and any unpaid common expense or special assessment currently due and payable from the selling unit owner;\n\n(3) a statement of any other fees payable by unit owners;\n\n(4) a statement of any capital expenditures anticipated by the association for the current and two next succeeding fiscal years;\n\n(5) a statement of the amount of any reserves for capital expenditures and of any portions of those reserves designated by the association for any specified projects;\n\n(6) the most recent regularly prepared balance sheet and income and expense statement, if any, of the association;\n\n(7) the current operating budget of the association;\n\n(8) a statement of any unsatisfied judgments against the association;\n\n(9) a statement describing any insurance coverage provided for the benefit of unit owners; and\n\n(10) a statement of the remaining term of any leasehold estate affecting the condominium and the provisions governing any extension or renewal thereof.\n\nB. The association, within ten working days after receipt of a request by a unit owner, shall furnish a certificate containing the information necessary to enable the unit owner to comply with this section. A unit owner providing a certificate pursuant to Subsection A of this section is not liable to the purchaser for any erroneous information provided by the association and included in the certificate.\n\nC. A purchaser is not liable for any unpaid assessment or fee greater than the amount set forth in the certificate prepared by the association. A unit owner is not liable to a purchaser for the failure or delay of the association to provide the certificate in a timely manner, but the purchase contract is voidable by the purchaser until the certificate has been provided and for seven days thereafter or until conveyance, whichever first occurs.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 61.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 4-109 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exceptions: in the introductory paragraph of Subsection A of this section of the state Condominium Act, \"disclosure\" is substituted for \"public offering,\" \"before execution of any contract for sale of a unit, or otherwise\" is deleted preceding \"before conveyance,\" and \"resale certificate from the association\" is substituted for \"certificate\"; \"existence and terms\" is substituted for \"effect on the proposed disposition\" in Paragraph (1) of Subsection A of this section of the state Condominium Act; \"and the status of any pending suits in which the association is a defendant\" is deleted at the end of Paragraph (8) of Subsection A of this section of the state Condominium Act; paragraphs (10) and (11) of subsection (a) of § 4-109 of the Uniform Condominium Act, relating to statements of the executive board as to knowledge of alterations or improvements to the unit or to limited common elements and as to knowledge of any health or building code violations with respect to the unit or any limited common elements assigned thereto or any other portion of the condominium, respectively, are deleted; \"receipt of\" is inserted in the first sentence of Subsection B of this section of the state Condominium Act; and \"seven\" is substituted for \"(5)\" near the end of Subsection C of this section of the state Condominium Act.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. In the case of the resale of a unit by a private unit owner who is not a declarant or a person in the business of selling real estate for his own account, a public offering statement need not be provided. See § 4-102(c) [47-7D-2C NMSA 1978]. Nevertheless, there are important facts which a purchaser should have in order to make a rational judgment about the advisability of purchasing the particular condominium unit. Accordingly, each unit owner not required to furnish a public offering statement under § 4-102(c) [47-7D-2C NMSA 1978] and not exempt under § 4-101(b) [47-7D-1B NMSA 1978] is required to furnish to a resale purchaser, before the execution of any contract of sale, a copy of the declaration, bylaws and rules and regulations of the association and a variety of fiscal, insurance and other information concerning the condominium and the unit.\n\n2. While the obligation to provide the information required by this section rests upon each unit owner (since the purchaser is in privity only with that unit owner), the association has an obligation to provide the information to the unit owner within 10 days after a request for such information. Under § 3-102(a)(12) [47-7C-2A(12) NMSA 1978], the association is entitled to charge the unit owner a reasonable fee for the preparation of the certificate. Should the association fail to provide the certificate as required, the unit owner would have a right to action against the association pursuant to § 4-117 [47-7D-17 NMSA 1978].\n\n3. Under subsection (c) [Subsection C], if a purchaser receives a resale certificate which fails to state the proper amount of the unpaid assessments due from the purchased unit, the purchaser is not liable for any amount greater than that disclosed in the resale certificate. Because a resale purchaser is dependent upon the association for information with respect to the outstanding assessments against the unit which he contemplates buying, it is altogether appropriate that the association should be prohibited from later collecting greater assessments than those disclosed prior to the time of the resale purchase.\n\nAm.

This section applies to the sale by persons required to furnish public offering statements of residential units and of non-residential units unless waived pursuant to the provisions of § 4-101 [47-7D-1 NMSA 1978]. It does not apply, however, to resales of units between private parties. Escrow provisions are not part of the law in several jurisdictions.\n\n2. This section provides declarant a number of choices as to the appropriate escrow agent. Whether the escrow agent must deposit the funds in an insured institutional depository, or in a particular type of account, depends on state law or the agreement of the parties. To minimize record keeping, of course, the institutional depository could itself be the escrow agent. The section does not require a separate account for each unit, so that mingling of funds in a single escrow account would be permitted. The account may be held whether in the state where the unit is located, or in the enacting state, in recognition that buyers are often from outside the state where the unit is located.\n\n3. The escrow requirements of this section apply in connection with any deposit made by a purchaser, whether such deposit is made pursuant to a binding contract or pursuant to a nonbinding reservation agreement (with respect to which no public offering statement is required under § 4-101(b)(6) [47-7D-1B(6) NMSA 1978]).\n\n4. In some states current practice permits escrows to be held by certain title insurance or escrow companies, attorneys or real estate brokers. Accordingly, the bracketed language should be included or deleted in accordance with local practice.\n\n5. Under this section, any interest earned on an escrow deposit may, but need not, be credited to the purchaser at closing, added to any deposit forfeited to the seller or added to any deposit refunded to the purchaser. In short, disposition of any interest is left to agreement of the parties.\n\n6. In some states, such as New York, the substitution of a bond in place of a deposit escrow is permitted. The evidence indicates, however, that in many instances the use of the bonding device has forced purchasers to incur substantial costs and delay prior to obtaining refunds to which they are entitled. For this reason, this act does not include bonding as an alternative to the required escrow of deposits.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 15A Am.

In the case of a sale of a unit where delivery of a disclosure statement is required pursuant to Subsection C of Section 54 [47-7D-2 NMSA 1978] of the Condominium Act, a seller shall, before conveying a unit, record or furnish to the purchaser releases of all liens affecting that unit and its common element interest which the purchaser does not expressly agree to take subject to or assume. This subsection does not apply to any real estate which a declarant has the right to withdraw.\n\nB. Before conveying real estate to the association, the declarant shall have that real estate released from all liens the foreclosure of which would deprive unit owners of any right of access to or easement of support of their units, and all other liens on that real estate unless the disclosure statement describes certain real estate which may be conveyed subject to liens in specified amounts.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 63.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 4-111 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exceptions: \"disclosure\" is substituted for \"public offering\" throughout this section of the state Condominium Act; and the bracketed language in subsection (a) of § 4-111 of the Uniform Condominium Act, relating to the provision of a surety bond or substitute collateral for or insurance against a lien, is deleted.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\nThe exemption for withdrawable real estate set forth in subsection (a) [Subsection A] is designed to preserve flexibility for the declarant in terms of financing arrangements. Theoretically, a developer might partially avoid the lien release requirement of subsection (a) [Subsection A] by placing part of the common element improvements such as a swimming pool or tennis court on withdrawable real estate. By doing so, it could separately mortgage that part of the common elements without being obligated to discharge the mortgage or secure partial releases when individual units are sold. (However, even if there were no withdrawable real estate exemption from the release-of-lien requirement, developers could still separately mortgage such improvements as pools and tennis courts without having to discharge the mortgage on sale of units. All they would have to do is leave the particular real estate out of the condominium and then convey it directly to the association subject to the mortgage.)\n\nIf a mortgage or other lien created by or arising against the developer attaches to withdrawable real estate after the declaration has been recorded, a lapse of the developer's right to withdraw the real estate would also terminate the rights of the lienor, since the lien would attach only to the developer's interest (the right to withdraw). However, an alert lienor would not permit the right to withdraw to lapse without taking steps to see that the right to withdraw is exercised. If the mortgage or other lien attached to the real estate and was perfected before the condominium declaration was recorded, lapse of the right to withdraw would not affect the lienor's rights and it could foreclose on the real estate whether or not the developer had lost the right to withdraw. As a practical matter, whether the mortgage or other lien against withdrawable real estate arises before or after the declaration is recorded, unit owners may find that, if the association does not release liens on withdrawable real estate containing common elements, the lienor will be able to withdraw the land and deprive the unit owners of its use. Therefore, unit purchasers and their counsel should be alert to that possibility.\n\nIf units are created in withdrawable real estate, the units, when sold, are subject to the release-of-lien rule of subsection (b)(1) [Subsection B] and after a unit in a particular withdrawable parcel is sold, that parcel can no longer be withdrawn. In that case, any lien created by or arising against the developer which attached to the real estate and is subordinate to the condominium declaration would automatically expire.\n\nAm.

A declarant of a condominium containing conversion buildings and any person in the business of selling real estate for his own account who intends to offer units in such a condominium shall give each of the residential tenants and residential subtenants in possession of a portion of a conversion building notice of the conversion and provide those persons with the disclosure statement no later than sixty days before the tenants and subtenants in possession are required to vacate. The notice shall set forth generally the rights of tenants and subtenants under this section and shall be hand-delivered to the unit or mailed by prepaid United States mail to the tenant and subtenant at the address of the unit or any other mailing address provided by a tenant. If mailed, the notice will be deemed received on the earlier of actual receipt or thirty days after mailing. No tenant or subtenant shall be required to vacate upon shorter notice than that required by the Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act, Section 47-8-1 NMSA 1978 et seq. Failure to give notice as required by this section is a defense to an action for possession.\n\nB. For sixty days after receipt of the notice described in Subsection A of this section, the person required to give the notice shall offer to convey each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use to the tenant who leases that unit. If a tenant fails to purchase the unit during the sixty-day period, the offeror may not offer to dispose of an interest in that unit during the following sixty days at a price more favorable to the offeree than the price offered to the tenant. This subsection does not apply to any unit in a conversion building if that unit will be restricted exclusively to nonresidential use or the boundaries of the converted unit do not substantially conform to the dimensions of the residential unit before conversion.\n\nC. If a seller, in violation of Subsection B of this section, conveys a unit to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, recordation of the deed conveying the unit extinguishes any right a tenant may have under Subsection B of this section to purchase that unit but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the seller for a violation of Subsection B of this section.\n\nD. From the date on which the tenant or subtenant accepts the offer pursuant to Subsection B of this section, there shall be no increase in the rental rate applicable to the portion of the conversion building of which the tenant or subtenant is in possession. If the tenant fails or refuses to consummate the purchase, the rent may thereafter be increased.\n\nE. Nothing in this section permits termination of a lease by a declarant in violation of its terms. Any provision in a lease which would permit termination or cancellation of the lease by a declarant prior to its stated term solely because the declarant seeks to convert the real estate to a condominium is unenforceable.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 64.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 4-112 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exceptions: in Subsection A of this section of the state Condominium Act, \"disclosure\" is substituted for \"public offering\" and \"sixty\" is substituted for \"120\" in the first sentence, \"If mailed, the notice will be deemed received on the earlier of actual receipt or thirty days after mailing\" is inserted and \"shorter notice than that required by the Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act, Section 47-8-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.\" is substituted in the next-to-last sentence for language in subsection (a) of § 4-112 of the Uniform Condominium Act prohibiting enforced vacation upon less than 120 days' notice, except for reasons such as nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct interfering with other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises; in Subsection B of this section of the state Condominium Act, \"receipt\" is substituted for \"delivery or mailing\" near the beginning of the first sentence, \"sixty\" is substituted for \"[180],\" following \"during the following\" in the second sentence and \"or on terms\" is deleted following \"price\" in two places in the second sentence; \"if the deed states that the seller has complied with subsection (b)\" is deleted following \"to purchase that unit\" in Subsection C of this section of the state Condominium Act; subsection (d) of § 4-112 of the Uniform Condominium Act, relating to notice of date of conversion constituting notice to vacate, is deleted and Subsection D of this section of the state Condominium Act is substituted therefor; and Subsection E of this section of the state Condominium Act adds the second sentence.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. One of the most controversial issues in the field of condominium development relates to conversion of rental buildings to condominiums. Opponents of conversions point out that the frequent result of conversions, which occur principally in large urban areas, is to displace low- and moderate-income tenants and provide homes for more affluent persons able to afford the higher prices which the converted apartments command. Indeed, studies indicate that the burden of conversion displacement falls most frequently on low- and moderate-income and elderly persons. At the same time, the conversion of a building to condominium ownership can lead to a substantial increase in property value, a result which proponents believe can be an important factor in curtailing the problem of declining urban tax bases. Proponents also point out that the conversion of rental units in inner-city areas to individual ownership frequently results in the stabilization of the buildings concerned, thus providing an important technique for use in neighborhood preservation and revitalization. This section, which seeks to balance these competing interests, is based principally on similar provisions set forth in the condominium statutes of Virginia and the District of Columbia.\n\n2. In an attempt to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of rental tenants and prospective owners, subsection (b) [Subsection B] provides the tenant a right for 60 days to purchase the unit which he leases at a price and on terms offered by the declarant. The subsection discourages unreasonable offers by declarants by providing that, if the tenant fails to accept the terms offered, the declarant may not thereafter sell the unit at a lower price or upon more favorable terms to a third person for at least 180 days. However, the declarant is not required to offer residential tenants the right to purchase commercial units or to offer to sell to tenants if the dimensions of their previous apartments have been substantially altered. The reason for this exception is that, if an apartment is subdivided or if two apartments are merged into a single condominium unit, compliance with the requirements of subsection (b) [Subsection B] would be impossible.\n\n3. Jurisdictions with rent control statutes should consider whether amendments to this section are necessary to conform to the procedures or substantive requirements set out in the rent control laws or whether modifications to the rent control laws may be required as a result of the enactment of this section.\n\n4. Except for the restrictions on permissible evictions stated in subsection (a) [Subsection A], this act does not change the law of summary process in a state. As a result, if a tenant refuses to vacate the premises following the 120-day notice, the usual provisions of the state's summary process statutes would apply, while any defenses available to a tenant would also be available.\n\nAm.

Such persons might include unit owners, persons exercising a declarant's rights of appointment pursuant to § 3-103(d) [47-7C-3D NMSA 1978] or the association itself. A claim for appropriate relief might include damages, injunctive relief, specific performance, rescission or reconveyance if appropriate under the law of the state or any other remedy normally available under state law. The section specifically refers to \"any person or class of persons\" to indicate that any relief available under the state class action statute would be available in circumstances where a failure to comply with this act has occurred.

Section 2-109(c) [47-7B-9C NMSA 1978] requires that the plats and plans for every condominium indicate whether or not any improvement that might be built in the condominium must be built. However, § 4-103 [47-7D-3 NMSA 1978] does not require that copies of the plats and plans be provided to purchasers as part of the public offering statement. Consequently, this section requiring the labeling of improvements depicted on promotional material is necessary to assure that purchasers are not deceived with respect to which improvements the declarant is obligated to make in a particular condominium project.\n\n2. Since no contemplated improvements on real estate subject to development rights need be shown on plats and plans, additional labeling is required by this section to insure that, if the declarant shows any contemplated improvements in his promotional material which are not shown on the plats and plans, those improvements must also be appropriately labeled.\n\nAm.
