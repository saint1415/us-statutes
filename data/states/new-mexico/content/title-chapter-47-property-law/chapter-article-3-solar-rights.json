Operations, research, experimentation and development in the field of solar energy use shall therefore be encouraged. While recognizing the value of research and development of solar energy use techniques and devices by governmental agencies, the legislature finds and declares that the actual construction and use of solar devices, whether at public or private expense, is properly a commercial activity which the law should encourage to be carried out, whenever practicable, by private enterprise.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 70-8-2, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 169, § 2.",

The term also includes any device, substance or element that collects solar energy for use in:\n\n(1) the heating or cooling of a structure or building;\n\n(2) the heating or pumping of water;\n\n(3) industrial, commercial or agricultural processes; or\n\n(4) the generation of electricity. A solar collector may be used for purposes in addition to the collection of solar energy. These uses include, but are not limited to, serving as a structural member or part of a roof of a building or structure and serving as a window or wall; and\n\nB. \"solar right\" means a right to an unobstructed line-of-sight path from a solar collector to the sun, which permits radiation from the sun to impinge directly on the solar collector.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 70-8-3, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 169, § 3; 2007, ch. 232, § 3.\n\nThe 2007 amendment,effective June 15, 2007, expanded the definition of \"solar collector\" to include devices that convey light to the interior of a building.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Access to Sunlight: New Mexico's Solar Rights Act,\" see 19 Nat.

The legislature declares that the right to use the natural resource of solar energy is a property right, the exercise of which is to be encouraged and regulated by the laws of this state. Such property right shall be known as a solar right.\n\nB. The following concepts shall be applicable to the regulation of disputes over the use of solar energy where practicable:\n\n(1) \"beneficial use.\" Beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure and the limit of the solar right, except as otherwise provided by written contract. If the amount of solar energy which a solar collector user can beneficially use varies with the season of the year, then the extent of the solar right shall vary likewise;\n\n(2) \"prior appropriation.\" In disputes involving solar rights, priority in time shall have the better right except that the state and its political subdivisions may legislate, or ordain that a solar collector user has a solar right even though a structure or building located on neighborhood property blocks the sunshine from the proposed solar collector site. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to diminish in any way the right of eminent domain of the state or any of its political subdivisions or any other entity that currently has such a right; and\n\n(3) \"transferability.\" Solar rights shall be freely transferable within the bounds of such regulation as the legislature may impose. The transfer of a solar right shall be recorded in accordance with Chapter 14, Article 9 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. Unless a singular overriding state concerns occur which significantly affect the health and welfare of the citizens of this state, permit systems for the use and application of solar energy shall reside with county and municipal zoning authorities.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 70-8-4, enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 169, § 4.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Rate Structure and Energy Conservation in the 1977 New Mexico Legislative Session,\" see 8 N.M.L.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Solar Recordation Act [47-3-6 to 47-3-12 NMSA 1978] or the Solar Rights Act [47-3-1 to 47-3-5 NMSA 1978], the governing body of a county or municipality may by ordinance regulate in whole or in part the claiming of solar rights in accordance with its powers to regulate zoning, planning and platting, and subdivisions; except that any solar right claimed pursuant to such local ordinance shall vest with respect to any property benefited or burdened by the solar right only after recordation as provided in Section 4 [47-3-9 NMSA 1978] of the Solar Recordation Act. Such local regulation shall not affect any solar right vested before the effective date of such ordinance, nor shall the local regulation affect any solar rights transfer which vested prior to the effective date of such ordinance. In the absence of the local regulation of solar rights, the following principles shall apply in addition to those set forth in the Solar Rights Act. If the property burdened by a solar right has or could have improvements constructed to a maximum height of twenty-four feet, then the solar right shall be limited, as to that burdened property, to protecting an unobstructed line-of-sight path from the solar collector to the sun only as to obstructions located on the burdened property which cast a shadow greater than the shadow cast by a hypothetical fence ten feet in height located on the property line of the property on which the solar collector is located. If the property burdened by a solar right has or could have improvements constructed in excess of twenty-four feet in height, but no greater than thirty-six feet, then the solar right shall be limited, as to that burdened property, to protecting an unobstructed line-of-sight path from the solar collector to the sun only as to obstructions located on the burdened property which cast a shadow greater than the shadow cast by a hypothetical fence fifteen feet in height located on the property line of the property on which the solar collector is located. No solar right shall be obtained against property which has or could have improvements constructed in excess of thirty-six feet in height unless so provided in a local ordinance or agreed to by contract. Unless otherwise provided by contract or local ordinance, a person may allow vegetation to grow or construct or plan to construct any improvement which obstructs the protected solar right so long as such obstruction does not block more than ten percent of the collectible solar energy between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Unless otherwise provided by contract or local ordinance, solar rights shall be protected between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.\n\nB.
