Farris, 2021-NMCA-014.\n\nDistrict court had subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's claim for damages pursuant to its original jurisdiction.— Where the parties entered into a lease option contract pursuant to which plaintiff agreed to lease and defendant agreed to rent a residential property in Vanderwagen, New Mexico for sixty months, and where the lease option contract included an option to purchase the residence at any time during the contract's terms, and where defendant paid plaintiff $10,000, which was not mentioned in the lease option contract but which defendant claimed to be a down payment toward the purchase price of the property, and where defendant stopped making monthly payments on the property after two years, and where plaintiff filed a petition for restitution seeking possession of the property in magistrate court, and where the magistrate court granted the writ of restitution and awarded damages, past-due rent, and attorney fees, and where, on de novo appeal, the district court ruled in plaintiff's favor on all issues and awarded plaintiff back-rent, damages over $10,000, and attorney fees, and where defendant argued that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that the grant of authority to magistrate courts would have prevented the district court, on de novo appeal, from awarding more than $10,000 in damages, the district court did not err in exercising jurisdiction because the district court decided plaintiff's claim for damages pursuant to its original jurisdiction and therefore any limits on the district court's de novo appellate jurisdiction did not apply here.White v. Farris,2021-NMCA-014.",

The Uniform Owner Resident Relations Act, 47-8-1 to 47-8-51 NMSA 1978, requires written notice of conditions needing repair and the passage of seven days before a resident can withhold rent.Cheng v.

If the subsequent breach occurs more than six months after the initial breach, it shall constitute an initial breach for purposes of applying the provisions of this section.\n\nC.

If rent is unpaid when due and the resident fails to pay rent within three days after written notice from the owner of nonpayment and his intention to terminate the rental agreement, the owner may terminate the rental agreement and the resident shall immediately deliver possession of the dwelling unit; provided that tender of the full amount due, in the manner stated in the notice, prior to the expiration of the three-day notice shall bar any action for nonpayment of rent.\n\nE.

Gutierrez, 2013-NMCA-026, 297 P.3d 1238.\n\nPetition for restitution filed prematurely.— Where, in 2017, tenant and landlord entered into a lease agreement that specified that rent was $450 and was due the first day of each month and that landlord would assess a $50 fee to rent paid more than three days late, that tenant would pay a $400 security deposit, and that landlord would make all necessary repairs to the common areas of the building, and where, in 2018, landlord asked tenant to begin paying $10 a month for water, to which tenant agreed, and where, months later, tenant withheld $40 from his rent after reviewing his lease and discovering that there was no written obligation for him to pay for water, and where, the following day, landlord delivered a notice of nonpayment requiring tenant to pay $450 in rent plus a late fee of $50 for a total of $500, and where landlord filed a petition for restitution three days after the notice of nonpayment was delivered, and where tenant argued that landlord filed his petition for restitution prematurely because the three-day notice period had not elapsed at the time of filing, the landlord's petition should have been dismissed as untimely filed, because an owner cannot file a petition for restitution or otherwise terminate the rental agreement and seek possession of the premises until the day following the third day. Allowing an owner to file before the third day has elapsed would defeat the remedial purpose of Subsection D of this section.Cheng v. Rabey, 2023-NMCA-013.\n\nLandlord and tenant orally modified the lease to include water payments.— Where, in 2017, tenant and landlord entered into a lease agreement that specified that rent was $450 and was due the first day of each month and that landlord would assess a $50 fee to rent paid more than three days late, that tenant would pay a $400 security deposit, and that landlord would make all necessary repairs to the common areas of the building, and where, in 2018, landlord asked tenant to begin paying $10 a month for water, to which tenant agreed, and where, months later, tenant withheld $40 from his rent after reviewing his lease and discovering that there was no written obligation for him to pay for water, and where, the following day, landlord delivered a notice of nonpayment requiring tenant to pay $450 in rent plus a late fee of $50 for a total of $500, and where landlord filed a petition for restitution three days after the notice of nonpayment was delivered, and where tenant argued that because the lease was silent as to who pays for water, landlord retained the obligation to pay for water, the district court did not err in denying tenant's requested offset for water, because the parties conduct clearly demonstrated an oral modification of the lease agreement requiring tenant to pay for water. In the absence of a prohibiting statute, a written agreement which specifies it may only be amended in writing may nevertheless be changed by the parties' words or conduct that signify an intention to change the prior agreement.Cheng v.

Hufstedler, 2023-NMCA-040.\n\nDuty exemption clause did not permit owners to direct utility to shut off water services.— Where Plaintiffs brought a petition for restitution of possession of premises against Resident based on unpaid rent and property damage, and where the magistrate court entered a judgment for restitution in favor of plaintiffs and issued a corresponding writ of restitution, ordering the sheriff to remove resident within seven days of entry of the judgment, and where, prior to the execution of the writ of restitution, plaintiffs had resident's water shut off for unpaid water charges, and where, on appeal to the district court, resident filed a counterclaim for unlawful diminution of services and seeking abatement of rent for the days resident was without water service, the district court erred in concluding that, because the utility was holding plaintiffs responsible for resident's unpaid water bill, the duty exemption clause, set forth in 47-8-36(A)(4) NMSA 1978, permitted plaintiffs to direct the utility to shut off the dwelling unit's water services, because, in this case, the utility had not acted to interrupt utility services before plaintiffs directed the utility to do so.

      "text": "A. If either party feels aggrieved by the judgment, that party may appeal as in other civil actions. An appeal by the defendant shall stay the execution of any writ of restitution; provided that in cases in which the resident is the appellant, the execution of the writ of restitution shall not be stayed unless the resident, within five days of the filing of the notice of appeal, pays to the owner or into an escrow account with a professional escrow agent an amount equal to the rental amount that shall come due from the day following the judgment through the end of that rental period. The resident shall continue to pay the monthly rent established by the rental agreement at the time the complaint was filed, on a monthly basis on the date rent would otherwise become due. Payments pursuant to this subsection by a subsidized resident shall not exceed the actual amount of monthly rent paid by that resident. When the resident pays the owner directly, the owner shall immediately provide a written receipt to the resident upon demand. When the resident pays into an escrow account the resident shall cause such amounts to be paid over to the owner immediately upon receipt unless otherwise ordered by the court. Upon the failure of the resident or the escrow agent to make a monthly rent payment on the first day rent would otherwise be due, the owner may serve a three-day written notice on the resident pursuant to Subsection D of Section 47-8-33 NMSA 1978. If the resident or the resident's escrow agent fails to pay the rent within the three days, a hearing on the issue shall be scheduled within ten days from the date the court is notified of the failure to pay rent. In the case of an appeal de novo, the hearing shall be in the court in which the appeal will be heard. If, at the hearing, the court finds that rent has not been paid, the court shall immediately lift the stay and issue the writ of restitution unless the resident demonstrates a legal justification for failing to comply with the rent payment requirement.\n\nB. In order to stay the execution of a money judgment, the trial court, within its discretion, may require an appellant to deposit with the clerk of the trial court the amount of judgment and costs or to give a supersedeas bond in the amount of judgment and costs with or without surety. Any bond or deposit shall not be refundable during the pendency of any appeal.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 70-7-47, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 38, § 47; 1989, ch. 253, § 2; 1995, ch. 195, § 22; 1999, ch. 91, § 7.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective June 18, 1999, rewrote Subsection A.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, added the subsection designations and rewrote this section to such an extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nThe 1989 amendment,effective June 16, 1989, made minor stylistic changes in the second sentence, and inserted the fourth and fifth sentences.\n\nEffect of violation of stay of execution.— This section does not explicitly or implicitly require that a property owner either do or not do a specific act after the court has issued a writ of restitution, nor does the statute provide a standard of conduct for a reasonable person under circumstances where an appeal has been taken. Accordingly, violation of the statute does not establish negligence per se.Runge v.

If suit is brought by any party to the rental agreement to enforce the terms and conditions of the rental agreement or to enforce any provisions of the Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs to be assessed by the court.\n\nB. Any owner who violates a provision of Section 47-8-36 or 47-8-39 NMSA 1978 shall be subject to a civil penalty equal to two times the amount of the monthly rent.\n\nC. Any resident who intentionally violates a provision of Subsection F of Section 47-8-22 NMSA 1978 shall be subject to a civil penalty equal to two times the amount of the monthly rent.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 70-7-48, enacted by Laws 1975, ch. 38, § 48; 1995, ch. 195, § 23.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1995, designated the existing language as Subsection A, and in that subsection, substituted \"or to enforce any provisions\" for \"entered into pursuant to the terms\", and substituted \"attorneys' \" for \"attorney's\"; and added Subsections B and C.\n\nDetermination of reasonable attorney fees.— Where a fire, that was negligently caused by defendant, destroyed plaintiff's personal property in a mobile home that plaintiff rented from defendant; the jury awarded plaintiff $25,000 in compensatory damages; plaintiff sought $70,318 in attorney fees based on the lodestar calculation of time spent on the case and the hourly rate charged by plaintiff's counsel; and on the grounds that plaintiff's attorney fees were almost three times the jury award and that the case involved only property damage and no broader public policy, the district court applied a proportional test and awarded plaintiff $10,000 in attorney fees with an offset of $5,000 for defendant's successful defense of plaintiff's claims for punitive damages, emotional stress damages, and civil penalty damages, the district court abused its discretion because the district court failed to consider the public policy goals of the Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act to encourage compliance with the act and because the district court failed to consider a lodestar analysis or any objective analysis of the facts in determining attorney fees.Behrens v. Gateway Court, L.L.C., 2013-NMCA-097, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-009.\n\nPrevailing party.— The \"prevailing party\" is the party who wins on the merits or on the main issue of the case.Hedicke v.

Gunville, 2003-NMCA-032, 133 N.M. 335, 62 P.3d 1217, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 413, 63 P.3d 516.\n\nPrevailing parties are entitled to award of reasonable attorney fees.— Where tenants brought action against apartment owner and manager for violations of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act (UPA), §§ 57-12-1 through § 57-12-26 NMSA 1978, and the New Mexico Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act (UORRA), §§ 47-8-1 through § 47-8-52 NMSA 1978, and where the parties reached a settlement agreement on all issues except attorney fees, plaintiffs were entitled to reasonable attorney fees, notwithstanding the fact that the damage award was small, because plaintiffs successfully prosecuted their UPA and UORRA claims; the amount involved and the results obtained are only one factor among several the court may consider to determine a reasonable attorney fee.Fallen v.
