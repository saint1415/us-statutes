      "text": "A. Prior to the recordation of any instrument transferring a time share, the developer shall record or furnish to the purchaser a release of all liens affecting that time share or shall provide a surety bond or insurance against the lien from a company acceptable to the commission as provided for liens on real estate in this state, and such underlying lien document shall contain a provision wherein the lienholder subordinates its rights to that of a time share purchaser who fully complies with all of the provisions and terms of the contract of sale.\n\nB. Unless a time share purchaser or a time share purchaser's predecessor in title has agreed otherwise with the lienholder, if a lien other than a mortgage or deed of trust becomes effective against more than one time share in a time share project, any time share purchaser is entitled to a release of his time share from a lien upon payment of the amount of the lien attributable to his time share. The amount of the payment shall be proportionate to the ratio that the time share purchaser's liability bears to the liabilities of all time share purchasers whose interests are subject to the lien. Upon receipt of payment, the lienholder shall promptly deliver to the time share purchaser a release of the lien covering that time share. After payment, the managing agent may not assess or have a lien against that time share for any portion of the expenses incurred in connection with that lien.\n\nHistory:Laws 1986, ch. 97, § 16.",
