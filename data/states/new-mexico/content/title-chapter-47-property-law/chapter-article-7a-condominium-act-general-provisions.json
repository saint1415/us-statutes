Those sections of the uniform act not adopted by New Mexico are §§ 1-110 (Uniformity), 4-113 to 4-116 (Warranties) and Article 5, §§ 5-101 to 5-110 (Administration and Registration). Where applicable, the parallel New Mexico sections are designated as \"Reserved.\"\n\nIncluded following each section of the New Mexico act are the official commissioners' comments to the uniform act. Compiler's notes following each section indicate the similar uniform act provision and its differences, if any, with the New Mexico provision. Where possible, references to the uniform act in the comments have been translated to the parallel New Mexico provisions.\n\nSection 47-7A-1 NMSA 1978 is substantially similar to § 1-101 of the Uniform Condominium Act.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' PREFATORY NOTE\n\nThis act contains comprehensive provisions designed to unify and modernize the law of condominiums, which has undergone great change in the last 16 years. As a result of the increasing usefulness and flexibility of the condominium concept, condominiums have become one of the most common forms of community ownership of property in the United States.\n\nAll states have statutes which provide for the creation of condominiums and establish some rules concerning their governance. The first statute in the United States was adopted in 1958 in Puerto Rico, and most of the present state statutes are patterned after that 1958 statute, or after the 1962 federal housing administration model condominium statute. As the condominium form of ownership became widespread, however, many states realized that these early statutes were inadequate to deal with the growing condominium industry. In particular, many states perceived a need for additional consumer protection, as well as a need for more flexibility in the creation and use of condominiums. As a result, some states have recently enacted more detailed and comprehensive \"second generation\" statutes.\n\nThe statutes governing condominiums in the various states use varying and sometimes inappropriate terminology, and differ in numerous details, all of which make it difficult for a national lender to assess the appropriateness of condominium documents and of condominium financing arrangements in those states. Moreover, the varying statutes, creating different \"bundles of rights\" for purchasers of condominiums in the various states, also make it difficult for the increasingly mobile consumer to become educated in this very complex area. Finally, many actual or potential problems involving such matters as termination of condominiums, eminent domain, insurance and the rights and obligations of lenders upon foreclosure of a condominium project, have not been satisfactorily addressed by any existing statute. It is primarily to resolve these various problems that the Uniform Condominium Act was drafted.\n\nArticle 1 [this article] of the act contains definitions and general provisions applicable throughout the act. The article deals with such matters as applicability, separate titles and taxation, eminent domain, applicability of other statutes and other general matters.\n\nArticle 2 [Article 7B, Chapter 47 NMSA 1978] provides for the creation, alteration and termination of the condominium. The article provides great flexibility to a developer in creating a condominium project designed to meet the needs of a modern real estate market, while imposing reasonable restrictions on developers' practices which have a potential for harm to unit purchasers.\n\nArticle 3 [Article 7C, Chapter 47 NMSA 1978] concerns the administration of the unit owners' association, a matter which has received very limited attention in the statutes of the various states. This article provides broad-ranging powers to the association, and covers such matters as insurance, tort and contract liability of the association and other matters often not dealt with in current statutes.\n\nArticle 4 [Article 7D, Chapter 47 NMSA 1978] deals with consumer protection for condominium unit purchasers. In addition to treating specific abuses which have developed in the condominium industry in the past, the article requires very substantial disclosure by developers, which must be made available to consumers before conveyance of a unit. To further promote disclosure, the article also requires that all owners of units in residential condominiums provide resale certificates to subsequent purchasers, regardless of when the condominium was created.\n\nArticle 5 is an optional article which establishes an administrative agency to supervise a developer's activities. The article is so drafted that it may be included in the act in those states where an agency is thought desirable, and deleted from the act in those states which desire to have the act enforced by private action. In the event that a state determines to delete Article 5 from the act, other provisions of the act, indicated in the text by brackets, should also be deleted. A list of these sections appears in the prefatory note to Article 5.\n\nThe Uniform Condominium Act was originally a part of the Uniform Land Transactions Act, but was separated from that act for further consideration at the 1975 annual meeting of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. This act was approved at the annual meeting of the conference in Vail, Colorado in August 1977.\n\nSince promulgation of the act in 1977, and approval by the American Bar Association in 1978, the act has received widespread legislative attention. The Act was enacted in its uniform version in Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia during the 1979-80 legislative year, and was enacted with substantial amendments in Louisiana in 1978-79. By 1980, it had also been introduced in the legislatures of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri, Tennessee, Vermont and Wyoming.\n\nDuring this same period, the national conference appointed a drafting committee to draft a Uniform Planned Community Act (UPCA), and that act was promulgated by the conference at its 1980 annual meeting. UPCA applies to a wide variety of other forms of multiple ownership real estate regimes which are similar in legal structure to condominiums, but do not meet the definition of \"condominium\" either, under present state law or the Uniform Condominium Act.\n\nAs a result of the legislative process in the various states considering the act, and review of the act by the drafting committee on UPCA, a large number of amendments to the 1977 Act were proposed to the conference.\n\nMany of these amendments were adopted at the 1980 annual meeting of the conference, and have been included in this edition of the act. Most of them are of a minor non-substantial nature; they are intended to resolve insignificant technical questions, or to clarify the meaning of provisions susceptible to misinterpretation. A few amendments were adopted which result in more significant changes, either on particular matters of substance, or in the use of terms throughout the act which simplify the structure and readability of the act. A summary of the more significant amendments can be obtained from the headquarters office of the NCCUSL, Suite 510, 645 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60611.\n\nA second category of changes results from a decision of the conference at its 1978 annual meeting that the Condominium and Planned Community Acts should contain identical provisions wherever possible, in order to facilitate the consolidation of the two acts in those states desiring a single uniform act covering both forms of multiple ownership developments. This required a large number of textual changes with no substantive effect. As a result, however, there are very few differences between the two acts, and consolidation would be a simple and desirable approach in states desiring uniform coverage of both forms of ownership. An analysis of the differences between the acts, and a general description of how the acts might be consolidated, appear in the prefatory note to UPCA. However, at this time, the conference has not prepared a consolidated text, because of its continuing consideration of the co-operative form of ownership, and the possibility that a consolidated act might be applicable to co-operatives as well.\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico law relating to property, see 13 N.M.L.

      "text": "A. The Condominium Act applies to all condominiums created within this state after the effective date of that act.\n\nB. The provisions of the Building Unit Ownership Act do not apply to condominiums created after the effective date of the Condominium Act. Any provisions of the declaration, bylaws, plats or plans of a condominium created before the effective date of the Condominium Act, which provisions are not expressly authorized by the Building Unit Ownership Act [47-7-1 to 47-7-25, 47-7-26 to 47-7-28 NMSA 1978] but which would have been authorized by the Condominium Act, had it been in effect, are hereby ratified. A condominium subject to the provisions of the Building Unit Ownership Act shall become subject to the Condominium Act and not the Building Unit Ownership Act if a resolution to that effect is approved by a majority of the unit owners and is then recorded as are instruments creating interests in real property. The declaration, bylaws, plats or plans of a condominium created before the effective date of the Condominium Act shall be amended in conformity with the procedures and requirements specified by those instruments and by the Building Unit Ownership Act. If the amendment grants to any person any rights, powers or privileges not expressly authorized by the Building Unit Ownership Act but permitted by the Condominium Act, all correlative obligations, liabilities and restrictions in the Condominium Act also apply to that person.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 69.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 1-102 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exceptions: Subsection A of this section does not set forth the detailed three-step approach of subsection (a) of § 1-102 of the Uniform Condominium Act, as to condominiums created before the effective date of the state Condominium Act; Subsection B of this section expands upon the procedure by which unit owners of a pre-existing condominium may elect to subject their association to the provisions of the state Condominium Act; the state Condominium Act does not include subsection (c) of § 1-102 of the Uniform Condominium Act, which deals with out-of-state condominiums.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. The question of the extent to which a state statute should apply to particular condominiums involves two problems: first, the extent to which the statute should require or permit different results for condominiums created before and after the statute becomes effective; and second, whether the statute should impose any or all of its substantive requirements on condominiums located outside the state.\n\nTwo conflicting policies are proposed when considering the applicability of this act to \"old\" and \"new\" condominiums located in the enacting state. On the one hand, it is desirable, for reasons of uniformity, for the act to apply to all condominiums located in a particular state, regardless of whether the condominium was created before or after adoption of the act in that state. To the extent that different laws apply within the same state to different condominiums, confusion results in the minds of both lenders and consumers. Moreover, because of the inadequacies and uncertainties of condominiums created under old law, and because of the requirements placed on declarants and unit owners' associations by this act which might increase the costs of new condominiums, different markets might tend to develop for condominiums created before and after adoption of the act.\n\nOn the other hand, to make all provisions of this act automatically apply to \"old\" condominiums might violate the constitutional prohibition of impairment of contracts. In addition, aside from the constitutional issue, automatic applicability of the entire act almost certainly would unduly alter the legitimate expectations of some present unit owners and declarants.\n\nAccordingly, the philosophy of this section reflects a desire to maximize the uniform applicability of the act to all condominiums in the enacting state, while avoiding the difficulties raised by automatic application of the entire act to pre-existing condominiums.\n\n2. In carrying out this philosophy with respect to \"new\" condominiums, the act applies to all condominiums \"created\" within the state after the act's effective date. This is the effect of the first sentence of subsection (a) [Subsection A]. The first sentence of subsection (b) [Subsection B] makes clear that the provisions of old statutes expressly applicable to condominiums do not apply to condominiums created after the effective date of this act.\n\n\"Creation\" of a condominium pursuant to this act occurs upon recordation of a declaration pursuant to § 2-101 [47-7B-1 NMSA 1978]; however, the definition of \"condominium\" in § 1-103(7) [47-7A-3G NMSA 1978] contemplates that de facto condominiums may exist, if the nature of the ownership interest fits the definition, and the act would apply to such a condominium. Any real estate project which includes individually owned units and common elements owned by the unit owners as tenants in common is therefore subject to the act if created within the state after the act's effective date. No intent to subject the condominium to the act is required, and an express intention to the contrary would be invalid and ineffective.\n\n3. The section adopts a novel three-step approach to condominiums created before the effective date of the act. First, certain provisions of the act automatically apply to \"old\" condominiums, but only prospectively, and only in a manner which does not invalidate provisions of condominium declarations and bylaws valid under \"old\" law. Second, \"old\" law remains applicable to previously created condominiums where not automatically displaced by the act. Third, owners of \"old\" condominiums may amend any provisions of their declaration or bylaws, even if the amendment would not be permitted by \"old\" law, so long as (a) the amendment is adopted in accordance with the procedure required by \"old\" law and the existing declaration and bylaws, and (b) the substance of the amendment does not violate this act.\n\n4. Elaboration of the principles described in Comment 3 may be helpful.\n\nFirst, the second sentence of subsection (a) [Subsection A] provides that the enumerated provisions automatically apply to condominiums created under pre-existing law, even though no action is taken by the unit owners. Many of the sections which do apply should measurably increase the ability of the unit owners to effectively manage the association, and should help to encourage the marketability of condominiums created under early condominium statutes. To avoid possible constitutional challenges, these provisions, as applied to \"old\" condominiums, apply only to \"events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this act\"; moreover, the provisions of this act are subject to the provisions of the instruments creating the condominium, and this act does not invalidate those instruments.\n\nUnder subsection (a) [Subsection A], § 4-109 [47-7D-9 NMSA 1978] (Resale Certificates) automatically applies to \"old\" condominiums. Accordingly, unit owners in condominiums established prior to adoption of the act would be obligated after the act's effective date to provide resale certificates to future purchasers of units in \"old\" condominiums. However, the failure of a unit owner to provide such a certificate to a purchaser who acquired the unit before the effective date of the act would not create a cause of action in the purchaser, because the conveyance was an event occurring before the effective date of the act.\n\nUnder subsection (a) [Subsection A], § 3-118 [47-7C-18 NMSA 1978] (Association Records) automatically applies to \"old\" condominiums. As a result, a unit owners' association of an \"old\" condominium must maintain certain financial records, and all the records of the association \"shall be made reasonably available for examination by any unit owner and his authorized agents\", even if the \"old\" law did not require that records be kept, or access provided. If the declaration or bylaws, however, provided that unit owners could not inspect the records of the association without permission of the president of the association, the restriction in the declaration would continue to be valid and enforceable.\n\nSecond, the prior laws of the state relating to condominiums are not repealed by this act because those laws will still apply to previously-created condominiums, except when displaced. Some states, such as Connecticut and Florida, have made certain provisions of their condominium statutes automatically applicable to pre-existing condominiums. In certain instances, this attempted retroactive application has raised serious constitutional questions, has caused doubts to arise as to the continued validity of those condominiums, and has created general confusion as to what statutory rules should be applied.\n\nThird, the act seeks to alleviate any undesirable consequences of \"old\" law, by a limited \"opt-in\" provision. More specifically, subsection (b) [Subsection B] permits the owners of a pre-existing condominium to take advantage of the salutary provisions of this statute to the extent that can be accomplished consistent with the procedures for amending the condominium instruments as specified in those instruments and in the pre-existing statute.\n\nUnder most \"first generation\" condominium statutes, unit owners have no power to relocate boundaries between adjoining units. Under § 2-112 [47-7B-12 NMSA 1978] of this act, unit owners have such power, unless limited by the declaration. While § 2-112 [47-7B-12 NMSA 1978] does not automatically apply to \"old\" condominiums, if the unit owners of a pre-existing condominium amend their condominium instruments in the manner permitted by the old statute and their existing instruments to permit unit owners to relocate boundaries, this section would validate that amendment, even if it were invalid under old law.\n\n5. In considering the permissible amendments under subsection (b) [Subsection B], it is important to distinguish between the law governing the procedure for amending declarations, and the substance of the amendments themselves. An amendment to the declaration of the condominium created under \"old\" law, even if permissible under this act, must nevertheless be adopted \"in conformity with the procedures and requirements specified\" by the original condominium instruments, and in compliance with the old law.\n\nSuppose an \"old\" condominium declaration and \"old\" state law both provide that approval by 100% of the unit owners is required to amend the declaration, but the unit owners wish to amend the declaration to provide for only 67% of the unit owners' approval of future amendments, as permitted by § 2-117 [47-7B-17 NMSA 1978] of this act. The amendment would not be valid unless 100% of the unit owners approved it, because of the procedural requirement of the declaration and \"old\" law. Once approved, however, only 67% would be required for subsequent amendments.\n\n6. The last sentence of subsection (b) [Subsection B] addresses the potential problem of a declarant seeking to take undue advantage of the amendment provisions to assume a power granted by the act without being subject to the act's limitations on the power. The last sentence insures that, if declarants or other persons assume any of the powers and rights which the act grants, the correlative obligations, liabilities, and restrictions of the act also apply to that person, even if the amendment itself does not require that result.\n\nAssume that, pursuant to the provisions of the \"old\" law, the declarant may exercise control over the association for only three years from the date the condominium is created, but the control may be maintained during that period for so long as declarant owns any units. In the absence of any amendment, a provision in the declaration taking full advantage of the \"old\" law would be valid and enforceable. Assume further that, in the second year following creation of the condominium in question, this act is adopted. The declarant then properly amends the declaration pursuant to subsection (b) [Subsection B] to extend the period of declarant control for five years from the date of creation. The amendment would effectively extend control for two additional years, because § 3-103(d) [47-7C-3D NMSA 1978] does not limit the number of the years the declarant may specify as a control period.\n\nNevertheless, if the declarant, before that extended time limit has expired, conveys 75 percent of the units that may ever be a part of the condominium, or fails for two years to exercise development rights or offer units for sale in the ordinary course of business, the period of declarant control would terminate by virtue of the limitations in § 3-103(d) [47-7C-3D NMSA 1978]. That limitation is imposed on the declarant even if the amendment called for retaining control for so long as any units were owned by declarant, and despite the provision in the \"old\" law permitting such a restriction.\n\n7. The reference in subsection (b) [Subsection B] to \"all present statutes expressly applicable to condominiums or horizontal property regimes\" is intended to distinguish between a state's condominium enabling statutes and those statutes which apply not only to condominiums but to other forms of real estate, such as taxation statutes or subdivision statutes. Thus, reference to the state's condominium or horizontal property regime enabling statutes should be included here, while references to taxation, subdivision or other statutes which are not restricted solely to condominiums should not be included.\n\n8. In place of the words \"declaration, bylaws, and plats and plans\", each state should insert the appropriate terminology for those documents under the present state law, e.g., \"master deed, rules and regulations\", etc.\n\n9. This section does not permit a pre-existing condominium to elect to come entirely within the provisions of the act, disregarding old law. However, the owners of a pre-existing condominium may elect to terminate the condominium under pre-existing law and create a new condominium which would be subject to all the provisions of this act.\n\n10. Subsection (c) reflects the fact that there are practical as well as constitutional limits regarding the extent to which a state should or may extend its jurisdiction to out-of-state transactions. A state may, of course, properly exercise its authority to protect its citizens from false or misleading information relating to condominiums located in other states but sold in that state. However, where sales contracts are executed wholly outside the enacting state and relate to condominiums located outside the state, it seems more appropriate for the courts of the jurisdiction(s) in which the condominium is located and where the transaction occurs to have jurisdiction over the transaction.\n\nAm.

The first clause of this section permits the defined terms used in the act to be defined differently in the declaration and bylaws. Regardless of how terms are used in those documents, however, terms have an unvarying meaning in the act, and any restricted practice which depends on the definition of a term is not affected by a changed term in the documents.\n\nA declarant might vary the definition of \"unit owner\" in the declaration to exclude himself in an attempt to avoid assessments for units which he owns. The attempt would be futile, since the act defines a declarant who owns a unit as a unit owner and defines the liabilities of a unit owner.\n\n2. The definition of \"affiliate of a declarant\" (§ 1-103(1)) [Subsection A] is similar to the definitions in 12 U.S.C. § 1730(a) [§ 1730a], which prescribes the authority of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation to regulate the activities of savings and loan holding companies, and in 15 U.S.C. § 78(c)(18) [§ 78c(18)], which defines persons deemed to be associated with a broker or dealer for purposes of the federal securities laws.\n\nThe objective standards of the definition permit a ready determination of the existence of affiliate status to be made. Unlike 12 U.S.C. § 1730(a)(2)B [§ 1730a(a)(2)(D)], no power is vested in an agency to subjectively determine the existence of \"control\" necessary to establish affiliate status. Thus, affiliate status does not exist under the act unless these objective criteria are met.\n\n3. Definition (2) [Subsection B], \"allocated interests,\" refers to all of the interests which this act requires the declaration to allocate. See § 2-107 [47-7B-7 NMSA 1978].\n\n4. Definitions (4) and (25) [Subsections D and AA], treating \"common elements\" and \"units,\" should be examined in light of § 2-102 [47-7B-2 NMSA 1978], which specifies in detail how the precise differentiation between units and common elements is to be determined in any given condominium to the extent that the declaration does not provide a different scheme. No exhaustive list of items comprising the common elements is necessary in this act or in the declaration; as long as the boundaries between units and common elements can be ascertained with certainty, the common elements include by definition all of the real estate in the condominium not designated as part of the units.\n\n5. Definition (7) [Subsection G], \"condominium,\" makes clear that, unless the ownership interest in the common elements is vested in the owners of the units, the project is not a condominium. Thus, for example, if the common elements were owned by an association in which each unit owner was a member, the project would not be a condominium. Similarly, if a declarant sold units in a building but retained title to the common areas, granting easements over them to unit owners, no condominium would have been created. Such projects have many of the attributes of condominiums, but they are not covered by this act.\n\n6. Definition (8) [Subsection H], \"conversion building,\" is important because of the protection which the act provides in § 1-112 [47-7A-12 NMSA 1978] for tenants of buildings which are being converted into a condominium. The definition distinguishes between buildings which have never been occupied by any person before the time that the building is submitted to the condominium form of ownership, and buildings, whether new or old, which have been previously occupied by tenants. In the former case, because there have been no tenants in the building, the building would not be a conversion building, and no protection of tenants is necessary.\n\n7. Definition (9) [Subsection I], \"declarant,\" is designed to exclude persons who may be called upon to execute the declaration in order to ratify the creation of the condominium, but who are not intended to be charged with the responsibilities imposed on declarants by this act if that is all they do. Examples of such persons include holders of pre-existing liens and, in the case of leasehold condominiums, ground lessors. (Of course, such a person could become a declarant by subsequently succeeding to a special declarant right.) Other persons similarly protected by the narrow wording of this definition include real estate brokers, because they do not offer to dispose of their own interest in a unit. Similarly, unit owners reselling their units are not declarants because their units were \"previously disposed of\" when originally conveyed.\n\nThe last bracketed clause in this definition must be deleted in any state which chooses not to enact Article 5 of the act.\n\n8. Definition (11) [Subsection K], \"development rights,\" includes a panoply of sophisticated development techniques that have evolved over time throughout the United States and which have been expressly recognized (and regulated) in an increasing number of jurisdictions, beginning with Virginia in 1974.\n\nSome of these techniques relate to the phased (or incremental) development of condominiums which the declarant hopes, but cannot be sure, will be successful enough to grow to include more land than he is initially willing to commit to the condominium. For example, a declarant may be building (or converting) a 50-unit building on parcel A with the intention, if all goes well, to \"expand\" the condominium by adding an additional building on parcel B, containing additional units, as part of the same condominium. If he reserves the right to do so, i. e., to \"add real estate to a condominium,\" he has reserved a \"development right.\"\n\nIn certain cases, however, the declarant may desire, for a variety of reasons, to include both parcels in the condominium from the outset, even though he may subsequently be obliged to withdraw all or part of one parcel. Assume, for example, that in the example just given the declarant intends to build an underground parking garage that will extend into both parcels. If the project is a success, his documentation will be simpler if both parcels were included in the condominium from the beginning. If his hopes are not realized, however, and it becomes necessary to withdraw all or part of parcel B from the condominium and devote it to some other use, he may do so if he has reserved such a development right \"to withdraw real estate from a condominium.\" The portion of the garage which extends into parcel B may be left in the condominium (separated from the remainder of parcel B by a horizontal boundary), or the garage may be divided between parcels A and B with appropriate cross-easement agreements.\n\nThe right \"to create units, common elements, or limited common elements\" is frequently useful in commercial or mixed-use condominiums where the declarant needs to retain a high degree of flexibility to meet the space requirements of prospective purchasers who may not approach him until the condominium has already been created. For example, an entire floor of a high-rise building may be intended for commercial buyers, but the declarant may not know in advance whether one purchaser will want to buy the whole floor as a single unit or whether several purchasers will want the floor divided into several units, separated by common element walls and served by a limited common element corridor. This development right is sometimes useful even in purely residential condominiums, especially those designed to appeal to affluent buyers. Similarly, the development rights \"to subdivide units or convert units into common elements\" is most often of value in commercial condominiums, but can occasionally be useful in certain kinds of residential condominiums as well.\n\n9. Definition (12) [Subsection L], \"dispose\" or \"disposition,\" includes voluntary transfers to purchasers of any interest in a unit, other than as security for an obligation. Consequently, the grant of a mortgage or other security interest is not a \"disposition,\" nor is any transfer of any interest to a person who is excluded from the definition of \"purchaser,\" infra. However, the term includes more than conveyances and would, for example, cover contracts of sale.\n\n10. Definition (15) [Subsection O], \"leasehold condominium,\" should be distinguished from land which is leased to a condominium but not subjected to the condominium regime. A leasehold condominium means, by definition, real estate which has been subjected to the condominium form of ownership. In such a case, units located on the leasehold real estate are typically leased for long terms. At the expiration of such a lease, the condominium unit or the real estate underlying the unit would be removed from the condominium if the lease were not extended or renewed. On the other hand, real estate may not be subjected to condominium ownership, but may be leased directly to the association or to one or more unit owners for a term of years.\n\nThis distinction is very significant. Under § 3-105 [47-7C-5 NMSA 1978], the unit owners' association is empowered, following expiration of a period of declarant control, to cancel any lease or recreational or parking areas or facilities to which it is a party, regardless of who the lessor is. The association also has the power to cancel any lease for any land if the declarant or an affiliate of the declarant is a party to that lease. If the leased real estate, however, is subjected by the declarant to condominium form of ownership, that lease may not be cancelled unless it is unconscionable or unless the real estate was submitted to the condominium regime for the purpose of avoiding the right to terminate the lease. See § 3-105 [47-7C-5 NMSA 1978].\n\nWhile the subjective test of declarant's \"purpose\" may not always be clear, the rights of the association to cancel a lease depend upon the test. Thus, for example, a declarant who wishes to lease a swimming pool to the unit owners would have a choice of subjecting the pool for, say, a term of 20 years to the condominium form of ownership as a common element. At the end of the term, the lease would terminate and the real estate containing the pool would be automatically removed from the condominium unless there were a right to renew the lease. During the 20-year term, the lease would not be cancellable, regardless of the terms, unless it were found to be unconscionable under § 1-112 [47-7A-12 NMSA 1978], or cancellable because submitted for the purpose of avoiding the right to cancel. On the other hand, if the pool were not submitted to the condominium form of ownership and was leased directly to the association for a 20-year term, the association could cancel that lease 90 days after the period of declarant control expired, even if, for example, 18 years remained of the term.\n\nIn either case, the terms of the lease would have to be disclosed in the public offering statement.\n\n11. Definition (20) [Subsection V], \"purchaser,\" includes a person who acquires any interest in a unit, even as a tenant, if his tenancy entitles him to occupy the premises for more [less] than 20 years. This would include a tenant who holds a lease of a unit in a fee simple condominium for one year, if the lease entitles the tenant to renew the lease for more than four additional years. Excluded from the definition, however, are mortgagees, declarants and people in the business of selling real estate for their account. Persons excluded from the definition of \"purchaser\" do not receive certain benefits under Article 4 [Article 7D], such as the right to a public offering statement (§ 4-102(c) [47-7D-2C NMSA 1978]) and the right to rescind (§ 4-108 [47-7D-8 NMSA 1978]).\n\n12. Definition (21) [Subsection W], \"real estate,\" is very broad, and is very similar to the definition of \"real estate\" in § 1-201(16) of the Uniform Land Transactions Act.\n\nAlthough often thought of in two-dimensional terms, real estate is a three-dimensional concept and the third dimension is unusually important in the condominium context. Where real estate is described in only two dimensions (length and width), it is correctly assumed that the property extends indefinitely above the earth's surface and downwards toward a point in the center of the planet. In most condominiums, however, as in so-called \"air rights\" projects, ownership does not extend ab solo usque ad coelum, because units are stacked on top of units or units and common elements are interstratified. In such cases the upper and lower boundaries must be identified with the same precision as the other boundaries.\n\n13. Definition (23) [Subsection Y], \"special declarant rights,\" seeks to isolate those rights reserved for the benefit of a declarant which are unique to the declarant and not shared in common with other unit owners. The list, while short, encompasses virtually every significant right which a declarant might seek in the course of creating or expanding a condominium.\n\nAny person who possesses a special declarant right would be a \"declarant\", including any who succeed under § 3-104 [47-7C-4 NMSA 1978] to any of those rights. Thus, the concept of special declarant rights triggers the imposition of obligations on those who possess the rights. Under § 3-104 [47-7C-4 NMSA 1978], those obligations vary significantly, depending upon the particular special declarant rights possessed by a particular declarant. These circumstances are described more fully in the comments to § 3-104 [47-7C-4 NMSA 1978].\n\n14. Definition (24) [Subsection Z], \"time share,\" is based on § 1-102(14) and (18) of the Uniform Law Commissioners' Model Real Estate Time-Share Act.\n\n15. Definition (25) [Subsection AA], \"unit,\" describes a tangible, physical part of the project, rather than a right in, or claim to, a tangible physical part of the property. Therefore, for example, a \"time-share\" arrangement in which a unit is sold to 12 different persons each of whom has the right to occupy the unit for one month does not create 12 new units - there are, rather, 12 owners of the unit. (Under the section on voting (§ 2-110 [§ 3-110] [47-7C-10 NMSA 1978]), a majority of the time-share owners of a unit are entitled to cast the votes assigned to that unit.)\n\nWhile a separately described part of the project is not a unit unless it is designed for, and is subject to, separate ownership by persons other than the association, the association developer can hold or acquire units unless otherwise provided in the declaration. See, also, Comment 4.\n\n16. Definition (26) [Subsection BB], \"unit owners,\" contemplates that a seller under a land installment contract would remain the unit owner until the contract is fulfilled. As between the seller and the buyer, various rights and responsibilities might be assigned to the buyer by the contract itself, but the association would continue to look to the seller (for payment of any arrears in common expense assessments, for example) as long as the seller holds title.\n\nThe definition makes it clear that declarants, so long as they own units in the condominium, are unit owners and are therefore subject to all of the obligations imposed on other unit owners, including the obligation to pay common expense assessments against those units. This provision is designed to resolve ambiguities on this point which have risen under several existing state statutes.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The reference to Section 17 of the Condominium Act in Subsection AA is seemingly incorrect. Section 14 of the Condominium Act, compiled as 47-7B-2 NMSA 1978, describes the boundaries of condominium units.\n\nThe references to 12 U.S.C. § 1730 and 15 U.S.C. § 78 throughout Comment 2 seem incorrect, as the subject matter described is not contained in these provisions. Corrections, in brackets, were made to refer to the seemingly correct provisions.\n\nThe reference to § 2-110 of the uniform act in the last sentence of the first paragraph of Comment 15 seems incorrect, as § 2-110 deals with the exercise of development rights. Section 3-110 of the uniform act deals with voting.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 15A Am.

A declarant shall not evade the limitations or prohibitions of that act or the declaration by use of a power of attorney or any other device.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 3.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 1-104 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exception: \"shall not\" is substituted for \"may not\" where it appears in the Uniform Condominium Act.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. The act is generally designed to provide great flexibility in the creation of condominiums and, to that end, the act permits the parties to vary many of it provisions. In many instances, however, provisions of the act may not be varied, because of the need to protect purchasers, lenders and declarants. Accordingly, this section adopts the approach of prohibiting variation by agreement except in those cases where it is expressly permitted by the terms of the act itself.\n\n2. One of the consumer protections in this act is the requirement for consent by specified percentages of unit owners to particular actions or changes in the declaration. In order to prevent declarants from evading these requirements by obtaining powers of attorney from all unit owners, or in some other fashion controlling the votes of unit owners, this section forbids the use by a declarant of any device to evade the limitations or prohibitions of the act or of the declaration.\n\n3. The following sections permit variation:\n\nSection 1-102 [47-7A-2 NMSA 1978]. [Applicability.] Preexisting condominiums may elect to conform to the act.\n\nSection 1-103 [47-7A-3 NMSA 1978]. [Definitions.] All definitions used in the declaration and bylaws may be varied in the declaration, but not in interpretation of the act.\n\nSection 1-107 [47-7A-7 NMSA 1978]. [Eminent Domain.] The formulas for reallocation upon taking a part of a unit, and for allocation of proceeds attributable to limited common elements, may be varied.\n\nSection 2-102 [47-7B-2 NMSA 1978]. [Unit Boundaries.] The declaration may vary the distinctions as to what constitutes the units and common elements.\n\nSection 2-105 [47-7B-5 NMSA 1978]. [Contents of Declaration.] A declarant may add any information he desires to the required content of the declaration.\n\nSection 2-107 [47-7B-7 NMSA 1978]. [Allocation of Common Element Interests, Votes and Common Expense Liabilities.] A declarant may allocate the interests in any way desired, subject to certain limitations.\n\nSection 2-108 [47-7B-8 NMSA 1978]. [Limited Common Elements.] The act permits reallocation of limited common elements unless prohibited by the declaration.\n\nSection 2-109 [47-7B-9 NMSA 1978]. [Plats and Plans.] There is a presumption regarding horizontal boundaries of units, unless the declaration provides otherwise.\n\nSection 2-111 [47-7B-11 NMSA 1978]. [Alterations Within Units.] Subject to the provisions of the declaration, unit owners may make alterations and improvements to units.\n\nSection 2-112 [47-7B-12 NMSA 1978]. [Relocation of Boundaries Between Adjoining Units.] Subject to the provisions of the declaration, boundaries between adjoining units may be relocated by affected unit owners.\n\nSection 2-113 [47-7B-13 NMSA 1978]. [Subdivision of Units.] If the declaration expressly so permits, a unit may be subdivided into two or more units.\n\nSection 2-115 [47-7B-15 NMSA 1978]. [Use for Sales Purposes.] The declarant may maintain sales offices, management offices and model units only if the declaration so provides. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, the declarant may maintain advertising on the common elements.\n\nSection 2-116 [47-7B-16 NMSA 1978]. [Easement to Facilitate Exercise of Special Declarant Rights.] Subject to the provisions of the declaration, the declarant has an easement for these purposes.\n\nSection 2-117 [47-7B-17 NMSA 1978]. [Amendment of Declaration]. The declaration of a non-residential condominium may specify less than a two-thirds vote to amend the declaration. Any declaration may require a larger majority.\n\nSection 2-118 [47-7B-18 NMSA 1978]. [Termination of Condominium.] The declaration may specify a majority larger than 80 percent to terminate and, in a non-residential condominium, a smaller majority. The declarant may require that the units be sold following termination even though none of them have horizontal boundaries.\n\nSection 2-120 [47-7B-20 NMSA 1978]. [Master Associations.] The declaration may provide for some of the powers of the executive board to be exercised by a master association.\n\nSection 3-102 [47-7C-2 NMSA 1978]. [Powers of the Association.] The declaration may limit the right of the association to exercise any of the listed powers, except in a manner which discriminates in favor of a declarant. The declaration may authorize the association to assign its rights to future income.\n\nSection 3-103 [47-7C-3 NMSA 1978]. [Executive Board Members and Officers.] Except as limited by the declaration or bylaws, the executive board may act for the association.\n\nSection 3-106 [47-7C-6 NMSA 1978]. [Bylaws.] Subject to the provisions of the declaration, the bylaws may contain any matter in addition to that required by the act.\n\nSection 3-107 [47-7C-7 NMSA 1978]. [Upkeep of the Condominium.] Except to the extent otherwise provided by the declaration, maintenance responsibilities are set forth in this section, and income from real estate subject to development rights inures to the declarant.\n\nSection 3-108 [47-7C-8 NMSA 1978]. [Meetings.] The bylaws may provide for special meetings at the call of less than 20 percent of the executive board or the unit owners.\n\nSection 3-109 [47-7C-9 NMSA 1978]. [Quorums.] This section permits statutory quorum requirements to be varied by the bylaws.\n\nSection 3-110 [47-7C-10 NMSA 1978]. [Voting; Proxies.] A majority in interest of the multiple owners of a single unit determine how that unit's vote is to be cast unless the declaration provides otherwise. The declaration may require that lessees vote on specified matters.\n\nSection 3-113 [47-7C-13 NMSA 1978]. [Insurance.] The declaration may vary the provisions of this section in non-residential condominiums, and may require additional insurance in any condominium.\n\nSection 3-114 [47-7C-14 NMSA 1978]. [Surplus Funds.] Unless otherwise provided in the declaration, surplus funds are paid or credited to unit owners in proportion to common expense liability.\n\nSection 3-115 [47-7C-15 NMSA 1978]. [Assessments for Common Expenses.] To the extent otherwise provided in the declaration, common expenses for limited common elements must be assessed against the units to which they are assigned, common expenses benefiting fewer than all the units must be assessed only against the units benefited, insurance costs must be assessed in proportion to risk, and utility costs must be assessed in proportion to usage.\n\nSection 4-101 [47-7D-1 NMSA 1978]. [Applicability;Waiver.] All of Article 4 [Article 7D] is modifiable or waivable by agreement in a condominium restricted to non-residential use.\n\nSection 4-115 [not adopted]. [Warranties.] Implied warranties of quality may be excluded or modified by agreement.\n\nSection 4-116 [not adopted.] [Statute of Limitations on Warranties.] The six-year limitation may be modified by agreement of the parties.\n\n4. The second sentence of the section is an important limitation upon the rights of a declarant. It is the practice in many jurisdictions today, particularly jurisdictions which do not permit expansion of a condominium by statute, for a declarant to secure powers of attorney from all unit purchasers permitting the declarant unilaterally to expand the condominium by \"unanimous consent\" to include new units and to reallocate common element interests, common expense liability and votes. With such powers of attorney, many declarants have purported to comply with the typical provision of \"first generation\" condominium statutes requiring unanimous consent for amendments of the declaration concerning such matters.\n\nSection 2-117 [47-7B-17 NMSA 1978] requires unanimous consent to make certain amendments to the declaration and bylaws. If a declarant were permitted to use powers of attorney to accomplish such changes, the substantial protection which § 2-117(d) [47-7B-17D NMSA 1978] provides to unit owners would be illusory. Section 1-104 [this section] prohibits the declarant from using powers of attorney for such purposes.\n\n5. While freedom of contract is a principle of this act, and variation by agreement is accordingly widely available, freedom of contract does not extend so far as to permit parties to disclaim obligations of good faith, see § 1-113 [47-7A-13 NMSA 1978], or to enter into contracts which are unconscionable when viewed as a whole, or which contain unconscionable terms. See § 1-112 [47-7A-12 NMSA 1978]. This section derives from § 1-102(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code [55-1-102 NMSA 1978].\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 15A Am.

The association of unit owners shall elect whether:\n\n(1) the entire property shall be deemed a single parcel for the purposes of assessment and taxation, in which event the association shall promptly notify the unit owners of the payment of the taxes.

Any portion of the common elements for which the declarant has reserved any development right must be separately taxed and assessed against the declarant, and only the declarant is liable for payment of such taxes.\n\nC. If there is no unit owner other than a declarant, the real estate comprising the condominium may be taxed and assessed in any manner provided by the Property Tax Code [Chapter 7, Articles 35 to 38 NMSA 1978].\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 4; 1983, ch. 245, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 1-105 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exceptions: subsections (a) and (b) of the Uniform Condominium Act have been substantially subsumed within Subsection A of the state Condominium Act, which allows unit owners to choose between two methods of treating the property for purposes of assessment and taxation.\n\nThe 1983 amendmentsubstituted \"elements\" for \"areas\" in Subsection A(2).\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. A condominium may be created, by the recordation of a declaration, long before the first unit is conveyed. This happens frequently with existing rental apartment projects which are converted into condominiums. Subsection (d) [Subsection C] spares the local taxing authorities from having to assess each unit separately until such time as the declarant begins conveying units, although separate assessment from the date the condominium is created may be permitted under other law. See subsection (d) [Subsection C]. When separate tax assessments become mandatory under this section, the assessment for each unit must include the value of that unit's common element interest, and no separate tax bill on the common elements is to be rendered to the association or the unit owners collectively. Any common elements subject to development rights, however, are separately taxed to the declarant.\n\n2. Even if real estate subject to development rights is a part of the condominium and lawfully \"owned\" by the unit owners in common, it is in fact an asset of the declarant, and must not be taxed and assessed against unit owners. Under subsection (c) [Subsection B], the declarant is exclusively liable for those taxes.\n\n3. If there is any question in a particular state that a unit occupied as a residential dwelling is not entitled to treatment as any other residential single-family detached dwelling under the homestead statutes, this section should be modified to insure that units are similarly treated.\n\n4. Unlike the law of New York and perhaps other states, this section imposes no limitation on the power of a jurisdiction to tax the condominium unit based on its fair market value. In most jurisdictions, experience has shown that the conversion of an apartment building to the condominium form of ownership greatly increases the fair market value of that building. Accordingly, a jurisdiction under this act may impose real estate taxes on condominium units which reflect the fair market value of those units in the same way that the jurisdiction taxes other forms of real estate.\n\nAm.

The first sentence of this section prohibits discrimination against condominiums by local law-making authorities. Thus, if a local law, ordinance or regulation imposes a requirement which cannot be met if property is subdivided as a condominium but which would not be violated if all of the property constituting the condominium were owned by a single owner, this section makes it unlawful to apply that requirement or restriction to the condominium. For example, in the case of a high-rise apartment building, if a local requirement imposing a minimum number of parking spaces per apartment would not prevent a rental apartment building from being built, this act would override any requirement that might impose a higher number of spaces per apartment merely by virtue of the same building being owned as a condominium.\n\n2. The second sentence makes clear that, except for the prohibition on discrimination against condominiums, the act has no effect on real estate use laws. For example, a particular piece of real estate submitted to the condominium form of ownership might be of such size that all of the real estate is required to support a proposed density of units or to satisfy minimum setback requirements. Under this act, part of the submitted real estate might be subject to a development right entitling the declarant to withdraw it from the condominium, but the mere reservation of this right would not constitute a subdivision of the parcel into separate ownership. If a declarant or foreclosing lender at a later time sought to exercise the option to withdraw the real estate, however, withdrawal would constitute a subdivision and would be illegal if the effect of withdrawal would be to violate setback requirements, or to exceed the density of units permitted on the remaining parcel.\n\nAm.

      "text": "A. If a unit is acquired by eminent domain, or if part of a unit is acquired by eminent domain leaving the unit owner with a remnant which may not practically or lawfully be used for any purpose permitted by the declaration, the award shall compensate the unit owner for his unit and his interest in the common elements, whether or not any common elements are acquired. Upon acquisition, unless the decree otherwise provides, that unit's allocated interests are automatically reallocated to the remaining units in proportion to the respective allocated interests of those units before the taking, and the association shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. Any remnant of a unit remaining after part of a unit is taken under this subsection is thereafter a common element.\n\nB. Except as provided in Subsection A of this section, if part of a unit is acquired by eminent domain, the award shall compensate the unit owner for the reduction in value of the unit and the unit's interest in the common elements, whether or not any common elements are acquired. Upon acquisition, unless the decree otherwise provides, that unit's allocated interests are reduced in proportion to the reduction in the size of the unit, or on any other basis specified in the declaration, and the portion of the allocated interests divested from the partially acquired unit are automatically reallocated to that unit and the remaining units in proportion to the respective allocated interests of those units before the taking, with the partially acquired unit participating in the reallocation on the basis of the unit's reduced allocated interests.\n\nC. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, if part of the common elements is acquired by eminent domain, the portion of the award attributable to the common elements taken shall be paid to the association. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, any portion of the award attributable to the acquisition of a limited common element shall be equally divided among the owners of the units to which that limited common element was allocated at the time of acquisition.\n\nD. The court decree shall be recorded in each county in which any portion of the condominium is located.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 6.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is substantially similar to § 1-107 of the Uniform Condominium Act.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. The provisions of this statute are not intended to supplant the usual rules of eminent domain but merely to supplement the rules to address the unique problems which eminent domain raises in the context of a condominium. Nevertheless, because the law of eminent domain differs widely among the various states, the law of each state should be reviewed to ensure that the eminent domain code and this section are properly integrated.\n\n2. When a unit is taken or partially taken by eminent domain, this section provides for a recalculation of the allocated interests of all units.\n\nSuppose that all allocated interests in a nine-unit condominium were originally allocated to the units on the basis of size. If eight of the units are equal in size and one is twice as large as the others, the allocated interests would be 20% for the largest unit and 10% for each of the other eight units.\n\nSuppose that one of the smaller units is taken out of the condominium by a condemning authority. Subsection (a) [Subsection A] provides that the allocated interests would automatically shift, at the time of the taking, so that the larger unit would have 22 2/9% while each of the small units would have 11 1/9%.\n\nSuppose, in Example 1, that the condemnation only reduced the size of one of the smaller units by 50%, leaving the remaining half of the unit usable. Subsection (b) [Subsection B] provides that the allocated interests would automatically shift to 5 5/19% for the partially taken unit, 21 1/19% for the largest unit, and 10 10/19% for each of the other units. Note that the fact that the partially taken unit was reduced to half its former size does not mean that its allocated interests are only half as large as before the taking. Rather, that unit participates in the reallocation in proportion to its reduced size. That is why the partially taken unit's reallocated interests are 5 5/19% rather than 5%.\n\n3. An important issue raised by this section is whether or not a governmental body acquiring a unit by eminent domain has a right to also take that unit's allocated interests and thereby assume membership in the association by virtue of its power of eminent domain. While there is no question that a governmental body may acquire any real property by eminent domain, there is no case law on the question of whether or not the governmental body may take a condominium unit as a part of the condominium or must take the unit and have the unit excluded from the condominium.\n\nSubsection (a) [Subsection A] merely requires that the taking body compensate the unit owner for all of his unit and its interest in the common elements, whether or not the common element interest is acquired. The act also requires that the allocated interests are automatically reallocated upon taking to the remaining units unless the decree provides otherwise. Whether or not the decree may constitutionally provide otherwise in the case of a particular taking (for example, by allocating the common element interest, votes and common expense liability to the government) is an unanswered question.\n\n4. In the circumstances of a taking of part of a unit, it is important to have some objective test by which to measure the portion of allocated interest to be reallocated. Subsection (b) [Subsection B] sets forth a formula based on relative size, but permits the declaration to vary that formula to some other more appropriate formula in a particular circumstance. This right to vary the formula in the declaration is important, since it is clear that the formula set forth in the statute may in some instances result in gross inequities.\n\nSuppose, in a commercial condominium consisting of four units, each unit consists of a factory and parking lot, and that the declaration provides that each unit's common expense liability, including utilities, is equal. Suppose further that the area of the factory building and parking lot in unit # 1 are equal, and that 1/2 the parking lot is taken by eminent domain, leaving the factory and 1/2 the lot intact. Under the formula set out in the statute, unit # 1's common expense liability would be reduced even though its utilities might not be reduced at all, thus resulting in a windfall for the unit owner.\n\nSuppose that a condominium contains ten units, each of which is allocated at 1/10 undivided interest in the common elements. Suppose further that a taking by eminent domain reduces the size of one of the units by 50%. In such case, the common element interest of all the units will be reallocated so that the partially-taken unit has a 1/19 undivided interest in the common elements and the remaining nine units each a 2/19 undivided interest in the common elements. Thus, the partially-taken unit has a common element interest equal to 1/2 of the common element interest allocated to each of the other units. Note that this is not equivalent to the partially-taken unit having a 5% undivided interest and the remaining nine units each having a 10% undivided interest.\n\n5. Even before the amendment formally acknowledging the reallocation of percentages required by this section is recorded, the reallocation is deemed to have occurred simultaneously with the taking. This rule is necessary to avoid the hiatus that otherwise could occur between the taking and reallocation of interests, votes and liabilities.\n\n6. Subsection (c) [Subsection C] provides that, if part of the common elements is acquired, the award is paid to the association. This would not normally be the rule in the absence of such a provision.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 26 Am. Jur. 2d Eminent Domain § 171 et seq.; 27 Am.
