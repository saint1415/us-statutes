The first purchaser of a unit is entitled to have in place the legal structure of the unit owners' association. The existence of the structure clarifies the relationship between the developer and other unit owners and makes it easy for the developer to involve unit owners in the governance of the condominium even during a period of declarant control reserved pursuant to § 3103(d) [47-7C-3D NMSA 1978].\n\n2. The bracketed language preserves the flexibility existing under the vast majority of present condominium statutes to organize the association as a profit or non-profit corporation or as an unincorporated association. Although at least one state (Georgia) requires the organization of the association in corporate form, it is not desirable to mandate this result in a uniform act. If a state wishes to mandate incorporation, it should delete the bracketed language.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 15A Am.

The declaration shall not impose limitations on the power of the association to deal with the declarant which are more restrictive than the limitations imposed on the power of the association to deal with other persons.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 35.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is substantially similar to § 3-102 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exception: the introductory paragraph of subsection (a) of § 3-102 of the Uniform Condominium Act includes the bracketed language \"even if unincorporated\" following \"the association.\"\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. This section permits the declaration, subject to the limitations of subsection (b) [Subsection B], to include limitations on the exercise of any of the enumerated powers. The bracketed language making a specific reference to unincorporated associations is not intended to exclude other forms of association; the unincorporated association would have such powers, subject to the declaration, regardless of the legal status of an unincorporated association in the state. If a state wishes to permit the association to be unincorporated and the law of the state is unclear whether an unincorporated association would have such powers in the absence of the language, the bracketed language should be retained and the brackets removed.\n\n2. Required provisions of the bylaws of the association, referenced in paragraph [(a)] (1) [Subsection A(1)], are set forth in § 3-106 [47-7C-6 NMSA 1978].\n\n3. Many state condominium statutes give the association the power to sue and be sued in its own name. In the absence of a statutory grant of standing such as that set forth in paragraph [(a)] (4) [Subsection A(4)], some courts have held that the association, because it has no ownership interest in the condominium, has no standing to bring, defend or to intervene in litigation or administrative proceedings in its own name.\n\n4. Paragraph [(a)] (8) [Subsection A(8)] refers to the power granted by § 3-112 [47-7C-12 NMSA 1978] to sell or encumber common elements without a termination of the condominium upon a vote of the requisite number of unit owners. Paragraph [(a)] (9) [Subsection A(9)] permits the association to grant easements, leases, licenses and concessions with respect to the common elements without a vote of the unit owners.\n\n5. The powers granted the association in paragraph [(a)] (11) [Subsection A(11)] to impose charges for late payment of assessments and to levy reasonable fines for violations of the association's rules reflect the need to provide the association with sufficient powers to exercise its \"governmental\" functions as the ruling body of the condominium community. These powers are intended to be in addition to any rights which the association may have under other law.\n\n6. Under paragraph [(a)] (14) [Subsection A(14)], the declaration may provide for the assignment of income of the association, including common expense assessment income, as security for, or payment of, debts of the association. The power may be limited in any manner specified in the declaration - for example, the power might be limited to specified purposes such as repair of existing structures, or to income from particular sources such as income from tenants, or to a specified percentage of common expense assessments. The power, in many instances, should help materially in securing credit for the association at favorable interest rates. The inability of associations to borrow because of a lack of assets, in spite of its income stream, has been a significant problem.\n\n7. If the association is incorporated, it may, pursuant to paragraph [(a)] (16) [Subsection A(16)], exercise all other powers of a corporation. Similarly, if the association is unincorporated, the association may, by virtue of paragraph [(a)] (16) [Subsection A(16)], exercise all other powers of an unincorporated association. Inconsistent provisions of state corporation or unincorporated association law are subject to the provisions of this act, as provided in § 1-108 [47-7A-8 NMSA 1978].\n\nAm.

      "text": "A. Except as provided in the declaration, the bylaws or other provisions of the Condominium Act, the executive board may act in all instances on behalf of the association. In the performance of their duties, the officers and members of the executive board are required to exercise, if appointed by the declarant, the care required of fiduciaries of the unit owners and, if elected by the unit owners, ordinary and reasonable care.\n\nB. The executive board shall not act on behalf of the association to amend the declaration, to terminate the condominium or to elect members of the executive board or determine the qualifications, powers and duties or terms of office of executive board members, but the executive board shall fill vacancies in its membership for the unexpired portion of any term.\n\nC. Within thirty days after adoption of any proposed budget for the condominium, the executive board shall provide a summary of the budget to all the unit owners, and shall set a date for a meeting of the unit owners to consider ratification of the budget not less than fourteen nor more than thirty days after mailing of the summary. Unless at that meeting a majority of all the unit owners or any larger vote specified in the declaration reject the budget, the budget is ratified, whether or not a quorum is present. In the event the proposed budget is rejected, the periodic budget last ratified by the unit owners shall be continued until such time as the unit owners ratify a subsequent budget proposed by the executive board.\n\nD. Subject to Subsection E of this section, the declaration may provide for a period of declarant control of the association, during which period a declarant, or persons designated by him, may appoint and remove the officers and members of the executive board. Regardless of the period provided in the declaration, a period of declarant control terminates no later than the earlier of:\n\n(1) one hundred eighty days after conveyance of ninety percent of the units which may be created to unit owners other than a declarant;\n\n(2) two years after all declarants have ceased to offer units for sale in the ordinary course of business; or\n\n(3) five years after any development right to add new units was last exercised.\n\nA declarant may voluntarily surrender the right to appoint and remove officers and members of the executive board before termination of that period, but in that event he may require, for the duration of the period of declarant control, that specified actions of the association or executive board, as described in a recorded instrument executed by the declarant, be approved by the declarant before they become effective.\n\nE. Not later than sixty days after conveyance of fifty percent of the units which may be created to unit owners other than a declarant, at least one member and not less than twenty-five percent of the members of the executive board shall be appointed by the declarant from among the unit owners. No member so appointed shall be an affiliate of the declarant if such persons are available.\n\nF. Not later than the termination of any period of declarant control, the unit owners shall elect an executive board of at least three members, at least a majority of whom shall be unit owners. The executive board shall elect the officers. The executive board members and officers shall take office upon election.\n\nG. Notwithstanding any provision of the declaration or bylaws to the contrary, the unit owners, by a two-thirds' vote of all persons present and entitled to vote at any meeting of the unit owners at which a quorum is present, may remove any member of the executive board with or without cause, other than a member appointed by the declarant.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 36.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 3-103 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exceptions: Subsection D(1) of this section of the state Condominium Act substitutes \"one hundred eighty days after conveyance of ninety percent\" for \"[60] days after conveyance of [75] percent,\" as it appears in subsection (d)(i) of § 3-103 of the Uniform Condominium Act; Subsection E of this section of the state Condominium Act, designed to act in conjunction with Subsection D to provide for the gradual transfer of control from the declarant to the unit owners, is comparable to subsection (e) of § 3-103 of the Uniform Condominium Act, but changes have been made as to the timing and extent of the transition from declarant to unit owner control.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. Subsection (a) [Subsection A] makes members of the executive board appointed by the declarant liable as fiduciaries of the unit owners with respect to their actions or omissions as members of the board. This provision imposes a very high standard of duty because the board is vested with great power over the property interests of unit owners, and because there is a great potential for conflicts of interest between the unit owners and the declarant.\n\nOfficers and board members elected by the unit owners are required only to exercise ordinary and reasonable care. This lower standard of care should increase the willingness of unit owners to serve as officers and members of the board.\n\n2. The provisions of paragraph (c) [Subsection C] permit the unit owners to disapprove any proposed budget, but a rejection of the budget does not result in cessation of assessments until a budget is approved. Rather, assessments continue on the basis of the last approved periodic budget until the new budget is in effect.\n\n3. Subsections (d) and (e) [Subsections D and E] recognize the practical necessity for the declarant to control the association during the developmental phases of a condominium project. However, any executive board member appointed by the declarant pursuant to subsection (d) [Subsection D] is liable as a fiduciary to any unit owner for his acts or omissions in such capacity.\n\n4. Subsection (d) [Subsection D] permits a declarant to surrender his right to appoint and remove officers and executive board members prior to the termination of the period of declarant control in exchange for a veto right over certain actions of the association or its executive board. This provision is designed to encourage transfer of control by declarants to unit owners as early as possible, without impinging upon the declarant's rights (for the duration of the period of declarant control) to maintain ultimate control of those matters which he may deem particularly important to him. It might be noted that the declarant at all times (even after the expiration of the period of declarant control) is entitled to cast the votes allocated to his units in the same manner as any other unit owner.\n\n5. Subsection (e) [Subsection E], in combination with subsection (d) [Subsection D], provides for a gradual transfer of control of the association to the unit owners from the declarant. Such a gradual transfer is preferable to a one-time turnover of control since it assures that the unit owners will be involved, to some extent, in the affairs of the association from a relatively early date and that some unit owners will acquire experience in dealing with association matters.\n\nAm.

Lack of privity does not deprive any unit owner of standing to maintain an action to enforce any obligation of the transferor;\n\n(2) if a successor to any special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant, the transferor is jointly and severally liable with the successor for any obligations or liabilities of the successor relating to the condominium;\n\n(3) if a transferor retains any special declarant right but transfers other special declarant rights to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor is liable for any obligations or liabilities imposed on a declarant by the Condominium Act or by the declaration relating to the retained special declarant rights and arising after the transfer; and\n\n(4) a transferor has no liability for any act or omission or any breach of a contractual or warranty obligation arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a successor declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor.\n\nC. Unless otherwise provided in a mortgage instrument or deed of trust, in case of foreclosure of a mortgage, tax sale, judicial sale or sale under bankruptcy laws or receivership proceedings, of any units owned by a declarant or real estate in a condominium subject to development rights, a person acquiring title to all the real estate being foreclosed or sold, but only upon his request, succeeds to all special declarant rights related to that real estate held by that declarant, or only to any rights reserved in the declaration pursuant to Section 27 [47-7B-15 NMSA 1978] of the Condominium Act and held by that declarant to maintain models, sales offices and signs. The judgment or instrument conveying title shall provide for transfer of only the special declarant rights requested.\n\nD. Upon foreclosure, tax sale, judicial sale, sale by a trustee under a deed of trust or sale under bankruptcy laws or receivership proceedings, of all units and other real estate in a condominium owned by a declarant:\n\n(1) the declarant ceases to have any special declarant rights; and\n\n(2) the period of declarant control terminates unless the judgment of instrument conveying title provides for transfer of all special declarant rights held by that declarant to a successor declarant.\n\nE. The obligations and liabilities of a person who succeeds to special declarant rights are as follows:\n\n(1) a successor to any special declarant right who is an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed on the transferor by the Condominium Act or by the declaration;\n\n(2) a successor to any special declarant right, other than a successor described in Paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection, who is not an affiliate of a declarant, is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed by the Condominium Act or the declaration:\n\n(a) on a declarant which relate to his exercise or nonexercise of special declarant rights; or\n\n(b) on his transferor, other than:\n\n1) misrepresentations by any previous declarant;\n\n2) warranty obligations on improvements made by any previous declarant, or made before the condominium was created;\n\n3) breach of any fiduciary obligation by any previous declarant or his appointees to the executive board; or\n\n4) any liability or obligation imposed on the transferor as a result of the transferor's acts or omissions after the transfer;\n\n(3) a successor to only a right reserved in the declaration to maintain models, sales offices and signs, if he is not an affiliate of a declarant, may not exercise any other special declarant right and is not subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant, except the obligations to provide a disclosure statement; and\n\n(4) a successor to all special declarant rights held by his transferor who is not an affiliate of that declarant and who succeeded to those rights pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or a judgment or instrument conveying title to units under Subsection C of this section may declare his intention in a recorded instrument to hold those rights solely for transfer to another person. Thereafter, until transferring all special declarant rights to any person acquiring title to any unit owned by the successor or until recording an instrument permitting exercise of all those rights, that successor shall not exercise any of those rights other than any right held by his transferor to control the executive board in accordance with the provisions of Section 36 [47-7C-3 NMSA 1978] of the Condominium Act for the duration of any period of declarant control, and any attempted exercise of those rights is void. So long as a successor declarant may not exercise special declarant rights under this subsection, he is not subject to any obligation or liability as a declarant other than liability for his acts and omissions under Section 36 of the Condominium Act.\n\nF. Nothing in this section subjects any successor to a special declarant right to any claims against or other obligations of a transferor declarant, other than claims and obligations arising under the Condominium Act or the declaration.'\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 37.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 3-104 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exceptions: Subsection B(1) of this section of the state Condominium Act deleted \"and remains liable for warranty obligations imposed upon him by this Act\" as it appears preceding \"Lack of privity\" in subsection (b)(1) of § 3-104 of the Uniform Condominium Act; Subsection C of this section of the state Condominium Act deletes \"sale by a trustee under a deed of trust\" as it appears following \"judicial sale\" in subsection (c) of § 3-104 of the Uniform Condominium Act; and Subsection E(3) of this section of the state Condominium Act substitutes \"disclosure statement\" for \"public offering statement\" and deletes \"[and] any liability arising as a result thereof [and obligations under Article 5.]\" as it appears at the end of subsection (e)(3) of § 3-104 of the Uniform Condominium Act.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. This section deals with the issue of the extent to which obligations and liabilities imposed upon a declarant by this act are transferred to a third party by a transfer of the declarant's interest in a condominium. There are two parts to the problem. First, what obligations and liabilities to unit owners (both existing unit owners and persons who become unit owners in the future) should a declarant retain, notwithstanding his transfer of interests. Second, what obligations and liabilities may fairly be imposed upon the declarant's successor in interest. No present condominium statute adequately addresses these issues.\n\n2. This section strikes a balance between the obvious need to protect the interests of the unit owners and the equally important need to protect innocent successors to a declarant's rights, especially persons such as mortgagees whose only interest in the condominium project is to protect their debt security. The general scheme of the section is to impose upon a declarant continuing obligations and liabilities for promises, acts or omissions undertaken during the period that he was in control of the condominium, while relieving a declarant who transfers all or part of his special declarant rights in a project of such responsibilities with respect to the promises, acts or omissions of a successor over whom he has no control. Similarly, the section imposes obligations and liabilities arising after the transfer upon a non-affiliated successor to a declarant's interests, but absolves such a transferee of responsibility for the promises, acts or omissions of a transferor declarant over which he had no control. Finally, the section makes special provision for the interests of certain successor declarants (e. g.,a mortgagee who succeeds to the rights of the declarant pursuant to a \"deed in lieu of foreclosure\" and who holds the project solely for transfer to another person) by relieving such persons of virtually all of the obligations and liabilities imposed upon declarants by this act.\n\n3. Subsection (a) [Subsection A] provides that a successor in interest to a declarant may acquire the special rights of the declarant only by recording an instrument which reflects a transfer of those rights. This recordation requirement is important to determine the duration of the period of declarant control pursuant to § 3-103(d) and (e) [47-7C-3 D and E NMSA 1978], as well as to place unit owners on notice of all persons entitled to exercise the special rights of a declarant under this act. The transfer by a declarant of all of his interest in a condominium project to a successor, without a concomitant transfer of the special rights of a declarant pursuant to this subsection, results in the automatic termination of such special declarant rights and of any period of declarant control.\n\n4. Under subsection (b) [Subsection B], a transferor declarant remains liable to unit owners (both existing unit owners and persons who subsequently become unit owners) for all obligations and liabilities, including warranty obligations on all improvements made by him, arising prior to the transfer. If a declarant transfers any special declarant right to an affiliate (as defined in § 1-103(1)) [47-7A-3 A NMSA 1978], the transferor remains subject to all liabilities specified in paragraph (1) of subsection (b) [Subsection B(1)] and, in addition, is jointly and severally liable with his successor in interest for all obligations and liabilities of the successor.\n\n5. The obligations and liabilities imposed upon transferee declarants under the act are set forth in subsection (e) [Subsection E]. In general, a transferee declarant (other than an affiliate of the original declarant and other than a successor whose interest in the project is solely for the protection of debt security) becomes subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed upon a declarant by the act or by the declaration with respect to any promises, acts or omissions undertaken subsequent to the transfer which relate to the rights he holds. Such a transferee is liable for the promises, acts or omissions of the original declarant undertaken prior to the transfer, except as set forth in paragraph (e)(2) (ii) [Subsection E(2)(b)]. For example, a successor declarant would not be liable for the warranty obligations of the original declarant with respect to improvements to the project made by the original declarant. Similarly, a successor would not be liable, under normal circumstances, for any misrepresentation or breach of fiduciary duty by the original declarant prior to the transfer. The successor is liable, however, to complete improvements labeled \"MUST BE BUILT\" on the original plans.\n\n6. To preclude declarants from evading their obligations and liabilities under this act by transferring their interests to affiliated companies, paragraph (1) of subsection (e) [Subsection E(1)] makes clear that any successor declarant who is an affiliate of the original declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed upon the original declarant by the act or by the declaration. Similarly, as previously noted, paragraph (2) of subsection (b) [Subsection B(2)] provides that an original declarant who transfers his rights to an affiliate remains jointly and severally liable with his successor for all obligations and liabilities imposed upon declarants by the act or by the declaration.\n\n7. The section handles the problem of certain successor declarants (i.e., persons whose sole interest in the condominium project is the protection of debt security) in three ways. First, subsection (c) [Subsection C] provides that, in the case of a foreclosure of a mortgage, a sale by a trustee under a deed of trust or a sale by a trustee in bankruptcy of any units owned by a declarant, any person acquiring title to all of the units being foreclosed or sold may request the transfer of special declarant rights. In that event, and only upon such request, such rights will be transferred in the instrument conveying title to the units and such transferee will thereafter become a successor declarant subject to the other provisions of this section. In the event of a foreclosure, sale by a trustee under a deed of trust or sale by a trustee in bankruptcy of all units owned by a declarant, if the transferee of such units does not request the transfer of special declarant rights, then, under subsection (d) [Subsection D], such special declarant rights cease to exist and any period of declarant control terminates.\n\nSecond, any person who succeeds to special declarant rights as a result of the transfers just described or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, may, pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection (e) [Subsection E(4)], declare his intention (in a recorded instrument) to hold those rights solely for transfer to another person. Thereafter, such a successor may transfer all special declarant rights to a third party acquiring title to any units owned by the successor but may not, prior to such transfer, exercise any special declarant rights other than the right to control the executive board of the association in accordance with the provisions of § 3-103(c)[(d)] [47-7C-3D NMSA 1978]. A successor declarant who exercises such a right is relieved of any liability under the act except liability for any acts or omissions related to his control of the executive board of the association. This provision is designed to deal with the typical problem of a foreclosing mortgage lender who opts to bid in and obtain the project at the foreclosure sale solely for the purpose of subsequent resale. It permits such a foreclosing lender to undertake such a transaction without incurring the full burden of declarant obligations and liabilities. At the same time, the provision recognizes the need for continuing operation of the association and, to that end, permits a foreclosing lender to assume control of the association for the purpose of ensuring a smooth transition.\n\nThird, paragraph (3) of subsection (e) [Subsection E(3)] provides that a successor who has only the right to maintain model units sales offices and signs does not thereby become subject to any obligations or liabilities as a declarant except for the obligation to provide a public offering statement and any liability resulting therefrom. This provision also is designed to protect mortgage lenders and contemplates the situation where a lender takes over a condominium project and desires to sell out existing units without making any additional improvements to the project. This provision facilitates such a transaction by relieving the mortgage lender, in that instance, from the full burden of obligations and liabilities ordinarily imposed upon a declarant under the act.\n\nUnder § 2-110 [47-7B-10 NMSA 1978], a declarant may reserve the right to create additional units in portions of the condominium which were originally designated as common elements. The declarant becomes the owner of any units created, but, prior to creation of units, the title to those portions of the condominium is in the unit owners. The right to create the units is an interest in land in which a security interest might be granted. If the mortgagee of that interest forecloses, the purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the choices concerning development rights and resulting liability which are described in the preceding paragraph.

      "text": "If entered into before the executive board elected by the unit owners pursuant to Section 36 [47-7C-3 NMSA 1978] of the Condominium Act takes office, any management contract, employment contract or lease of recreational or parking areas or facilities, any other contract or lease between the association and a declarant or an affiliate of a declarant or any contract or lease that is not bona fide or was unconscionable to the unit owners at the time entered into under the circumstances then prevailing may be terminated without penalty by the association at any time after the executive board elected by the unit owners pursuant to Section 36 of that act takes office, upon not less than ninety days' notice to the other party. This section does not apply to any lease the termination of which would terminate the condominium or reduce its size, unless the real estate subject to that lease was included in the condominium for the purpose of avoiding the right of the association to terminate a lease under this section.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 38.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is substantially similar to § 3-105 of the Uniform Condominium Act.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. This section deals with a common problem in the development of condominium projects: the temptation on the part of the developer, while in control of the association, to enter into, on behalf of the association, long-term contracts and leases with himself or with an affiliated entity.\n\nThe act deals with this problem in two ways. First, § 3-103(a) [47-7C-3A NMSA 1978] imposes upon all executive board members appointed by the declarant liability as fiduciaries of the unit owners for all of their acts or omissions as members of the board. Second, § 3-105 [this section] provides for the termination of certain contracts and leases made during a period of declarant control.\n\n2. In addition to contracts or leases made by a declarant with himself or with an affiliated entity, there are also certain contracts and leases so critical to the operation of the condominium and to the unit owners' full enjoyment of their rights of ownership that they too should be voidable by the unit owners upon the expiration of any period of declarant control. At the same time, a statutorily sanctioned right of cancellation should not be applicable to all contracts or leases which a declarant may enter into in the course of developing a condominium project. For example, a commercial tenant would not be willing to invest substantial amounts in equipment and other improvements for the operation of his business if the lease could unilaterally be cancelled by the association. Accordingly, this section provides that (subject to the exception set forth in the last sentence thereof), upon the expiration of any period of declarant control, the association may terminate without penalty, any \"critical\" contract (i. e., any management contract, employment contract or lease of recreational or parking areas or facilities) entered into during a period of declarant control, any contract or lease to which the declarant or an affiliate of the declarant is a party or any contract or lease previously entered into by the declarant which is not bona fide or which was unconscionable to the unit owners at the time entered into under the circumstances then prevailing.\n\n3. The last sentence of the section addresses to usual leasehold condominium situation where the underlying real estate is subject to a long-term ground lease which is then submitted to the act. Because termination of the ground lease would terminate the condominium, this sentence prevents cancellation. However, in order to avoid the possibility that recreation and other leases otherwise cancellable under subsection (a) [Subsection A] will be restructured to come within the exception, a subjective test of \"intent\" is imposed. Under the test, if a declarant's principal purpose in subjecting the leased real estate to the condominium was to prevent termination of the lease, the lease may nevertheless be terminated.\n\nAm.

The requirement, set forth in subsection (a)(5) [Subsection A(5)], that the bylaws designate which of the officers of the association has the responsibility to prepare, execute, certify and record amendments to the declaration reflects the obligation imposed upon the association by several provisions of this act to record such amendments in certain circumstances. These provisions include § 1-107 [47-7A-7 NMSA 1978] (Eminent Domain), § 2-106 [47-7B-6 NMSA 1978] (expiration of certain leases), § 2-112 [47-7B-12 NMSA 1978] (Relocation of Boundaries Between Adjoining Units), and § 2-113 [47-7B-13 NMSA 1978] (subdivision or conversion of units).

In addition to the liability that a declarant as a unit owner has under the Condominium Act, the declarant alone is liable for all expenses in connection with real estate subject to development rights. No other unit owner and no other portion of the condominium is subject to a claim for payment of those expenses. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, any income or proceeds from real estate subject to development rights inures to the declarant.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 40.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is substantially similar to § 3-107 of the Uniform Condominium Act.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. The act permits the declaration to separate maintenance responsibility from ownership. This is commonly done in practice. In the absence of any provision in the declaration, maintenance responsibility follows ownership of the unit or rests with the association in the case of common elements. Under this act, limited common elements (which might include, for example, patios, balconies and parking spaces) are common elements. See § 1-103(16) [47-7A-3P NMSA 1978]. As a result, under subsection (a) [Subsection A], unless the declaration requires that unit owners are responsible for the upkeep of such limited common elements, the association will be responsible for their maintenance. Under § 3-115(c) [47-7C-15C NMSA 1978], the cost of maintenance, repair and replacement for such limited common elements is assessed against all the units in the condominium, unless the declaration provides for such expenses to be paid only by the units benefited. See Comment 1 to § 2-108 [47-7B-8 NMSA 1978].\n\n2. Under § 2-110 [47-7B-10 NMSA 1978], a declarant may reserve the right to create units in portions of the condominium originally designated as common elements. Prior to creation of the units, title to those portions of the condominium is in the unit owners. However, under § 3-107(b) [47-7C-7B NMSA 1978], the developer is obligated to pay all of the expenses of (including real estate taxes properly apportionable to) that real estate. As to real estate taxes, see § 1-105(c) [47-7A-5C NMSA 1978].\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 15A Am.

If the wrong occurred during any period of declarant control and the association gives the declarant reasonable notice of and an opportunity to defend against the action, the declarant who then controlled the association shall indemnify the association or any unit owner other than an affiliate of the declarant for all judgments paid which are not covered by insurance, which judgments resulted from a breach of control or other wrongful act or omission on the part of the declarant.

Any statute of limitation affecting the association's right of indemnification under this section is tolled until the period of declarant control terminates. A unit owner is not precluded from bringing an action contemplated by this section because he is a unit owner or a member or officer of the association.

Note that this section of the state Condominium Act speaks of \"breach of control\" near the end of the third sentence; the drafters probably intended to state \"breach of contract,\" as set forth in the comparable provision of § 3-111 of the Uniform Condominium Act.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. This section provides that any action in tort or contract arising out of acts or omissions of the association shall be brought against the association and not against the individual unit owners. This changes the law in states where plaintiffs are forced to name individual unit owners as the real parties in interest to any action brought against the association. The subsection also provides that a unit owner is not precluded from bringing an action in tort or contract against the association solely because he is a unit owner or a member or officer of the association.\n\n2. In recognition of the practical control that can (and in most cases will) be exercised by a declarant over the affairs of the association during any period of declarant control permitted pursuant to § 3-103 [47-7C-3 NMSA 1978], subsection (a) [this section] provides that the association or any unit owner shall have a right of action against the declarant for any losses (including both payment of damages and attorneys' fees) suffered by the association or any unit owner as a result of an action based upon a tort or breach of contract arising during any period of declarant control. To assure that the decision to bring such an action can be made by an executive board free from the influence of the declarant, the subsection also provides that any statute of limitations affecting such a right of action by the association shall be tolled until the expiration of any period of declarant control.\n\n3. If a suit based on a claim which accrued during the period of developer control is brought against the association after control of the association has passed from the developer, reasonable notice to, and grant of an opportunity to the developer to defend, are conditions to developer liability. If, however, suit is brought against the association while the developer is still in control, obviously the developer cannot later resist a suit by the association for reimbursement on the grounds of failure to notify.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The reference to subsection (a) of § 3-111 of the uniform act in the first sentence in Comment 2 is obviously incorrect, as § 3-111 has no subsection (a).\n\nAm.

Portions of the common elements may be conveyed or subjected to a security interest by the association if persons entitled to cast at least eighty percent of the votes in the association, including eighty percent of the votes allocated to units not owned by a declarant, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, agree to that action, but all the owners of units to which any limited common element is allocated shall agree in order to convey that limited common element or subject it to a security interest. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. Proceeds of the sale are an asset of the association.\n\nB. An agreement to convey common elements or subject them to a security interest shall be evidenced by the execution of an agreement, or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners. The agreement shall specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless recorded before that date. The agreement and all ratifications thereof shall be recorded in each county in which a portion of the condominium is situated, and is effective only upon recordation.\n\nC. The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract to convey common elements or subject them to a security interest, but the contract is not enforceable against the association until approved pursuant to Subsections A and B of this section. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the conveyance or encumbrance, including the power to execute deeds or other instruments.\n\nD.

A conveyance or encumbrance of common elements pursuant to this section does not deprive any unit of its rights of access and support.\n\nF. A conveyance or encumbrance of common elements pursuant to this section does not affect the priority or validity of preexisting encumbrances.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 45.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 3-112 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exception: Subsection F of this section of the state Condominium Act does not include the bracketed optional language, \"[unless the declaration otherwise provides],\" which appears at the beginning of subsection (f) of § 3-112 of the Uniform Condominium Act.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. Subsection (a) [Subsection A] provides that, on agreement of unit owners holding 80% of the votes in the association, parts of the common elements may be sold or encumbered. (80% is the percentage required for termination of the condominium under § 2-118 [47-7B-18 NMSA 1978].) This power may be exercised during the period of declarant control, but, in order to be effective, 80% of non-declarant unit owners must approve the action.\n\nThe ability to sell a portion of the common elements without termination of the condominium gives the condominium regime desirable flexibility. For example, the unit owners, some years after the initial creation of the condominium, may decide to convey away a portion of the open space which has been reserved as a part of the common elements because they no longer find the area useful or because they wish to use sale proceeds to make other improvements. Similarly, the ability to encumber common elements gives the association power to raise money for improvements through the device of mortgaging the improvements themselves. Of course, recreational improvements will frequently not be sufficient security for a loan for their construction. Nevertheless, the ability to take a security interest in such improvements may lead lenders to be more favorably disposed toward making a loan in larger amounts and at lower interest rates.\n\n2. Subsection (b) [Subsection B] requires that the agreement for sale or encumbrance be evidenced by the execution of an agreement in the same manner as a deed by the requisite majority of the unit owners. The agreement then must be recorded in the land records. The recorded agreement signed by the unit owners is not the conveyance itself, but is rather a supporting document which shows that the association has full power to execute a deed or mortgage. Under subsection (c) [Subsection C], it is contemplated that the association will execute the actual instrument of conveyance. Under subsection (e) [Subsection E], a conveyance or encumbrance of common elements may not deprive a unit owner of rights of access and support.\n\n3. Under the condominium form of ownership, each unit owner owns a share of the common elements as an appurtenant interest to his unit and, when the unit owner mortgages his unit, he also mortgages his appurtenant interest. The unit owner himself cannot convey his unit separately from its interest in the common elements nor can he convey his common element interest separately from the unit. Therefore, if there is a mortgage or other lien against any unit, the problem arises as to whether the association under this section can convey a part of the common elements free from the mortgage interest of the unit mortgagee. Subsection (f) [Subsection F] answers that question no. Therefore, a sale or encumbrance of common elements under this section would be subject to the superior priority of any prior mortgagee on the unit unless the mortgagee releases his interest therein.\n\nThe bracketed introductory language to subsection (f) [Subsection F] is intended to permit an enacting state to choose whether or not the declaration could vary the rule of subsection (f) [Subsection F]. If the bracketed language is included, the declaration might provide, for example, that any subsequent conveyance of specified portions of the common elements would be free of prior security interests. In that case, the security interest in the common elements held by unit mortgagees would be cut off. Since the loss of the security interest in the common elements could significantly affect mortgagees, states considering inclusion of the bracketed language probably should consult mortgagee groups. If limited to particular common element real estate such as portions of recreational area land, and if protections are provided for lender interests, the ability to convey free of prior security interests could contribute significantly to the continued economic viability of a project. Therefore, lenders may be favorable to inclusion of the bracketed language.\n\nThe declaration could protect lender interests in connection with a conveyance free of the security interests in a number of ways. For example, the declaration might provide for payment of a specified percentage of the sales price to unit mortgagees or it might provide that a specified percentage of the mortgage debt be paid to them. Also, the declaration might provide that no sale or encumbrance of common elements would be effective without the approval of a specified percentage of lenders. There are, no doubt, other devices which could afford substantial protection to lenders.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 15A Am.

Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably available:\n\n(1) property insurance on the common elements insuring against all risks of direct physical loss commonly insured against or, in the case of a conversion building, against fire and extended coverage perils. The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than eighty percent of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from property policies; and\n\n(2) liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the executive board but not less than any amount specified in the declaration, covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury and property damage arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership or maintenance of the common elements.\n\nB. In the case of a building containing units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, the insurance maintained under Paragraph (1) of Subsection A of this section, to the extent reasonably available, shall include the units, but need not include improvements and betterments installed by unit owners.\n\nC. If the insurance described in Subsections A and B of this section is not reasonably available, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be hand-delivered or sent prepaid by United States mail to all unit owners. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance, and the association in any event may carry any other insurance it deems appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners.\n\nD. Insurance policies carried pursuant to Subsection A of this section must provide that:\n\n(1) each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of his interest in the common elements or membership in the association;\n\n(2) the insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner or member of his household;\n\n(3) no act or omission by any unit owner, unless acting within the scope of his authority on behalf of the association, shall void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy; and\n\n(4) if, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of the unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy provides primary insurance.\n\nE. Any loss covered by the property policy under Paragraph (1) of Subsection A and Subsection B of this section must be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of Subsection H of this section, the proceeds shall be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged property, and unit owners and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or restored or the condominium is terminated.\n\nF. An insurance policy issued to the association does not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for his own benefit.\n\nG. An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon written request, to any unit owner, mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurer issuing the policy may not cancel or refuse to renew it until thirty days after notice of the proposed cancellation or nonrenewal has been mailed to the association, each unit owner and each mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at his last known address.\n\nH. Any portion of the condominium for which insurance is required under this section which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless the condominium is terminated, repair or replacement would be illegal under any state or local health or safety statute or ordinance or eighty percent of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild. The cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves is a common expense. If the entire condominium is not repaired or replaced, the insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the condominium, and the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements which are not rebuilt must be distributed to the owners of those units and the owners of the units to which those limited common elements were allocated, or to lienholders, as their interests may appear, and the remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all the unit owners or lienholders, as their interests may appear, in proportion to the common element interests of all the units. If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's allocated interests are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under Subsection A of Section 6 [47-7A-7 NMSA 1978] of the Condominium Act, and the association promptly shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations.\n\nI. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection H of this Section, Section 30 [47-7B-18 NMSA 1978] of the Condominium Act governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the condominium is terminated.\n\nJ. Unless the declaration otherwise provides, the provisions of this section do not apply to a condominium all of whose units are restricted to nonresidential use.\n\nHistory:Laws 1982, ch. 27, § 46.\n\nCompiler's notes.— This section is similar to § 3-113 of the Uniform Condominium Act, with the following main exceptions: Subsection I of this section of the state Condominium Act is not contained in § 3-113 of the Uniform Condominium Act; and Subsection J of this section of the state Condominium Act substitutes \"Unless the declaration otherwise provides, the provisions of this section do not apply to\" for \"The provisions of this section may be varied or waived in the case of\" appearing in subsection (i) of the § 3-113 of the Uniform Condominium Act.\n\nCOMMISSIONERS' COMMENT\n\n1. Subsections (a) and (b) [Subsections A and B] provide that the required insurance must be maintained only to the extent reasonably available. This permits the association to comply with the insurance requirements even if certain coverages are unavailable or unreasonably expensive.\n\n(2) Subsection (b) [Subsection B] represents a significant departure from the present law in virtually all states by requiring that the association obtain and maintain property insurance on both the common elements and the units within buildings with \"stacked\" units. See Comment 3. While it has been common practice in many parts of the country (either by custom or as mandated by statute) for associations to maintain property insurance on the common elements, it has generally not been the practice for the property insurance policy to cover individual units as well. However, given the great interdependence of the unit owners in the stacked unit condominium situation, mandating property insurance for the entire building is the preferable approach. Moreover, such an approach will greatly simplify claims procedures, particularly where both common elements and portions of a unit have been destroyed. If common elements and units are insured separately, the insurers could be involved in disputes as to the coverage provided by each policy.\n\nThe act does not mandate association insurance on units in town house or other arrangements in which there are no stacked units. However, if the developer wishes, the declaration may require association insurance as to units having shared walls or as to all units in the development. Many developments will have some units with horizontal boundaries and other units with no horizontal boundaries. In that case, association insurance as to the units having horizontal boundaries is required, but it is not necessary as to other units.\n\n3. The distinction between what is a common element and what is a unit with respect to the insurance coverage required by this section is complex. The definitions of common elements and a unit in § 1-103(4) and (25) [47-7A-3D and AA NMSA 1978] are not sufficient for this purpose. To determine the distinction between the common elements and units, one must refer first to the declaration's section on unit boundaries. That section will define the unit boundaries. If the declaration fails to do so, the provisions of § 2-102 [47-7B-2 NMSA 1978] apply.\n\nIn summary, § 2-102 [47-7B-2 NMSA 1978] provides that, if the declaration is silent, all non-loadbearing and non-structural portions of the walls, floors and ceilings are part of the unit, while all loadbearing and structural portions of the walls, floors and ceilings are common elements. Further, with respect to any structure partially within and partially outside of the boundaries of a unit, any portion thereof serving only that unit is a limited common element (see definition in § 103(16) [47-7A-3P NMSA 1978]), and any portion thereof serving more than one unit or any portion of the common elements is a part of the common elements. This treats and defines ownership of all portions of the electrical, plumbing and mechanical systems serving the building not entirely within the boundaries of a unit.\n\nAll spaces, interior partitions, electrical, plumbing and mechanical systems and all other items within the boundaries of the unit which are attached to the unit boundaries, whether or not deemed fixtures under state law, are part of the unit.\n\nPut simply, if any item is installed, constructed, repaired or replaced by the declarant or his successor in connection with the original sale of a stacked unit, the item is insured by the association. Clearly, this does not include items of personal property easily movable within the unit or easily removable from the unit (whether or not deemed a fixture under state law), such as a vase, table or other furnishings. If installed by the unit owner, the item should be insured by the unit owner. Those items, installed by the unit owner and not covered by the association policy, are called \"improvements and betterments.\"\n\n4. Although \"all risk\" coverage is not required as to conversion buildings, but merely fire and extended coverage, this is not intended to imply that such coverage is unnecessary. \"All risk\" coverage is not required because it may not be appropriate in the case of an unrenovated conversion where cost is a critical factor.\n\n5. The minimum requirement as to the amount of insurance, which is 80% of the actual cash value, should not be viewed as a recommendation; rather, the 80% is a floor. Typically, many condominium documents require insurance in an amount equal to 100% of the replacement cost of the insured property. The act permits greater flexibility, however, inasmuch as different types of construction and varieties of projects may not require such total coverage with its attendant higher premium cost.\n\n6. Subsection (a) (2) [Subsection A(2)] covers only the liability of the association, and unit owners as members, but does not cover the unit owner's individual liability for his acts or omissions or liability for occurrences within his unit.\n\n7. Clause (i) of the third sentence of subsection (h) [Subsection H] would operate as follows: (1) if the condominium consists of campsites, restoration after fire damage might consist of merely resodding the area damaged; (2) if the condominium consists of separate garden-type buildings, restoration after fire damage might consist of demolishing the remaining structure and paving or landscaping the area; and (3) if the condominium consists of a single highrise building, restoration may not be required (if the building is substantially destroyed) inasmuch as \"a condition compatible with the remainder of the condominium\" would be damaged and unrestored.\n\n8. The scheme of this section, as set forth in subsection (h) [Subsection H], is that any damage or destruction to any portion of the condominium must be repaired (if repairs can be made consistent with applicable safety and health laws) absent a decision to terminate the condominium or a decision by 80% of the unit owners (including the owners of any damaged units) not to rebuild. Unless a decision is made not to rebuild, any available insurance proceeds must be used to effectuate such repairs. For this reason, subsection (e) [Subsection E] provides that any loss covered by the association's property insurance policy shall be adjusted with the association and that the proceeds for any loss shall be payable to the association or to any insurance trustee that may be designated for such purpose. Significantly, such insurance proceeds may not be paid to any mortgagee or other outside party. This provision is necessary to insure that insurance proceeds are available to effectuate any repairs or restoration to the condominium that may be required.\n\n9. In the case of commercial or industrial condominiums, unit owners may prefer to act as self-insurers or make other arrangements with respect to property insurance. Accordingly, subsection (i) [Subsection J] provides that the insurance requirements of this section may be varied or waived in the case of a condominium all of the units of which are reserved exclusively for non-residential use. Such waiver or modification is not possible in the case of a mixed-use condominium, some of the units of which are used for residential purposes.\n\nAm.

This section contemplates that a declarant might find it advantageous, particularly in the early stages of condominium development, to pay all of the expenses of the condominium himself rather than assessing each unit individually. Such a situation might arise, for example, where a declarant owns most of the units in the condominium and wishes to avoid billing the costs of each unit separately and crediting payment to each unit. It might also arise in the case of a declarant who, although willing to assume all expenses of the condominium, is unwilling to make payments for replacement reserves or for other expenses which he expects will ultimately be part of the association's budget. Subsection (a) [Subsection A] grants the declarant such flexibility while at the same time providing that once an assessment is made against any unit, all units, including those owned by the declarant, must be assessed for their full portion of the common expense liability.\n\n2. Under subsection (c) [Subsection C], the declaration may provide for assessment on a basis other than the allocation made in § 2-107 [47-7B-7 NMSA 1978] as to limited common elements, other expenses benefiting less than all units, insurance costs and utility costs.\n\n3. If additional units are added to a condominium after a judgment has been entered against the association, the new units are not assessed any part of the judgment debt. Since unit owners will know the assessment, and since such unpaid judgment assessments would affect the price paid by purchasers of units, it would be complicated and unnecessary to fairness to reallocate judgment assessments when new units are added.\n\n4. Subsection (f) [Subsection F] refers to those instances in which various provisions of this act require that common expense liabilities be reallocated among the units of a condominium by amendment to the declaration. These provisions include § 1-107 [47-7A-7 NMSA 1978] (eminent domain), § 2-106(d) [47-7B-6C NMSA 1978] (expiration of certain leases), § 2-110 [47-7B-10 NMSA 1978] (exercise of development rights) and § 2-113(b) [47-7B-13B NMSA 1978] (subdivision or conversion of units).\n\nAm.

Subsection (a) [Subsection A] provides that the association's lien on a unit for unpaid assessments shall be enforceable in the same manner as mortgage liens. In addition, if the use of a power of sale pursuant to a mortgage is permitted in a particular state, the bracketed language (with an appropriate statutory citation inserted) may be used to ensure that the association's lien for unpaid assessments may also be enforced through the power of sale device. The bracketed language requiring notice of foreclosure should be adopted only in states in which the power of sale statute does not require notice to junior lienholders.\n\n2. To ensure prompt and efficient enforcement of the association's lien for unpaid assessments, such liens should enjoy statutory priority over most other liens. Accordingly, subsection (a) [(b)] provides that the association's lien takes priority over all other liens and encumbrances except those recorded prior to the recordation of the declaration, those imposed for real estate taxes or other governmental assessments or charges against the unit, and first mortgages recorded before the date the assessment became delinquent. However, as to prior first mortgages, the association's lien does have priority for six months' assessments based on the periodic budget. A significant departure from existing practice, the six months' priority for the assessment lien strikes an equitable balance between the need to enforce collection of unpaid assessments and the obvious necessity for protecting the priority of the security interests of mortgage lenders. As a practical matter, mortgage lenders will most likely pay the six months' assessments demanded by the association rather than having the association foreclose on the unit. If the mortgage lender wishes, an escrow for assessments can be required. Since this provision may conflict with the provisions of some state statutes which forbid some lending institutions from making loans not required by first priority liens, the law of each state should be reviewed and amended when necessary.\n\n3. Subsection (e) [Subsection E] makes clear that the association may have remedies short of foreclosure of its lien that can be used to collect unpaid assessments. The association, for example, might bring an action in debt or breach of contract against a recalcitrant unit owner rather than resorting to foreclosure.\n\n4. In view of the association's powers to enforce its lien for unpaid assessments, subsection (f) [(h)] [Subsection G] provides unit owners with a method to determine the amount presently due and owing. A unit owner may obtain a statement of any unpaid assessment, including fines and other charges enforceable as assessments under subsection (a) [Subsection A], currently levied against his unit. The statement is binding on the association, the executive board and every unit owner in any subsequent action to collect such unpaid assessments.\n\n5. Units may be part of a condominium and of a larger real estate regime (see the Uniform Planned Community Act, promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1980, which would govern most associations with assessment powers). For example, a large real estate development may consist of a larger planned community which contains detached single family dwellings and town houses which are not part of any condominium and a highrise building which is organized as a condominium within the planned community. In that case, the planned community association might assess the condominium units for the general maintenance expenses of the planned community and the condominium association would assess for the direct maintenance expenses of the building itself. In such a situation, subsection (c) [Subsection B] provides that unpaid liens of the two associations have equal priority regardless of the relative time of creation of the two regimes and regardless of the time the assessments were made or become delinquent.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The reference to subsection (a) of § 3-116 of the uniform act in the second sentence in Comment 2 seems incorrect, as that subsection deals with the creation and foreclosure of liens. Subsection (b) of § 3-116 deals with priority of liens.\n\nThe reference to subsection (f) of § 3-116 of the uniform act in the first sentence in Comment 4 seems incorrect, as that subsection deals with other remedies. Subsection (h) of § 3-116 deals with assessment statements furnished to unit owners.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 15A Am.

This section deals with the effect on unit owners of judgments against the association. The issue is not free from difficulty. Presently, in most states, if the association is organized as a corporation, the unit owners are likely to receive the insulation from liability given shareholders of a corporation, so that the judgment lienholder can satisfy his judgment only against the property of the association. On the other hand, if the association is organized as an unincorporated association, under the law of most states each unit owner would have joint and several liability on the judgment. This act strikes a balance between the two extremes, making the judgment lien a direct lien against each individual unit, but allowing the individual unit owner to discharge the lien by payment of his pro-rata share of the judgment. The judgment would also be a lien against any property owned by the association.\n\n2. It should be noted that, while the judgment lien runs directly against unit owners, the actual liability of the unit owner is almost identical with what it would be if the ordinary corporation rule insulating the unit owner from direct liability were applied. If the incorporated association only is liable for a judgment, it will, of course, have no assets to satisfy the judgment except whatever personal property and real estate not a part of the common elements it owns. If a checking account or other cash funds of the association are attached or garnisheed by the creditor, the association, in order to maintain its operations and fulfill its other obligations, will be obliged to make an additional assessment against the unit owners to cover the judgment. The same result follows if the association is to prevent the sale of other assets at an execution sale. That additional assessment would be in precisely the amount for which this act gives a direct lien against the individual unit owners. Further, if an association which is without sufficient assets to satisfy a judgment refuses to make assessments from which the creditor can have his claim satisfied, it is very likely that a court, in a supplemental proceeding on the judgment, would direct the association to make the necessary assessments against the unit owners. Unpaid assessments made by the association constitute liens against units just as to judgments.\n\nTherefore, whether the lien of the judgment creditor runs against the units directly, or whether the lien is only against the association which finds it necessary to make additional assessments to satisfy the judgment, the unit owner who does not pay his proportionate share will end up with a lien against his unit.\n\nThe differences, therefore, between the lien system established by § 3-117 [this section] and the system which would be applicable if ordinary corporation rules were applied are these:\n\n(1) The unit owner can discharge his unit from the lien and free it from the possibility of being subsequently assessed by the association for the judgment by making a payment directly to the lienholder. This ability may be valuable to a unit owner who is in the process of selling or securing a mortgage on his unit during the period between the time the judgment is entered and the time the association makes a formal assessment against individual unit owners for the amount of the judgment lien.\n\n(2) The judgment creditor through his ability to threaten to foreclose the lien on an individual unit if the judgment is not paid is given some leverage over individual unit owners to encourage them to see that the association pays the judgment. Procuring an assessment through pressure on individual unit owners may be quicker and cheaper for the judgment creditor than using supplemental proceedings and having a judge order that the board of directors make the necessary assessment.\n\nIn the rare case where, under corporation law an association could avoid payment of a judgment by dissolution of the association and vesting of title to the units in the unit owners as tenants-in-common or otherwise, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws believes that that result is inappropriate, and that the unit in the condominium itself should be viewed as equity property of the association capable of being reached by judgment creditors in satisfaction of the judgment. As a matter of social policy the condominium association is in quite a different position than the ordinary corporation. The corporation statutes provide shareholders immunity from liability for debts of the corporation to encourage investment in corporations whose entrepreneurial activities in the marketplace contribute to the general wealth and well-being of society. The condominium association, in managing the affairs of the homeowners, does not serve the same entrepreneurial function. It seems reasonable, as a matter of social policy, that an individual homeowner who would be fully liable for debts incurred in the renovation and maintenance of his home or for torts caused by his failure to adequately maintain the premises should not be able to entirely avoid that liability through the device of organizing with other homeowners into a condominium association. On the other hand, it is perhaps not fair to a unit owner in a condominium regime to have all of his assets at risk based on the contracts of the association over which he has little control and as to which he has only a fractional interest or benefit.\n\nIt should be noted that, except for situations in which the association has given a mortgage or deed of trust on common elements, the judgment creditor cannot assert a lien against common elements, but is rather left to a lien against the units. That is, the judgment creditor has no power to levy on the golf course or on the swimming pool or other open spaces and sell them independently of the units to satisfy the judgment.\n\nAm.
