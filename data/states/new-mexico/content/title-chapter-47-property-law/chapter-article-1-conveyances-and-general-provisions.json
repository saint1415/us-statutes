      "heading": "\"Real estate\" defined.Section 47-1-2 - Monopolies; entailments; primogeniture",
      "text": "The term \"real estate\", as used in Chapter 47 NMSA 1978, shall be so construed as to be applicable to lands, tenements and hereditaments, including all real movable property and leaseholds. As used in this section \"leasehold\" means an estate in real estate or real property held under a lease.\n\nHistory:Laws 1851-1852, p. 372; C.L. 1865, ch. 44, § 2; C.L. 1884, § 2749; C.L. 1897, § 3940; Code 1915, § 4758; C.S. 1929, § 117-102; 1941 Comp., § 75-101; 1953 Comp., § 70-1-1; 1991, ch. 234, § 3.\n\nCross references.— For void indemnity agreements,see56-7-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective April 4, 1991, added the section heading; added \"and leaseholds\" at the end of the first sentence; added the second sentence; and made a minor stylistic change.\n\nValidating clauses.— Laws 1991, ch. 234, § 4 defined \"leasehold\" to mean an estate in real estate or real property held under a lease and validates as correct and legally effective filings or recordings to give constructive notice any actions taken prior to April 4, 1991 to file or record leases, memoranda, assignments or amendments thereto, leasehold mortgages or other writings affecting leaseholds or any interests in leaseholds in accordance with legal requirements for the filing or recording of writings affecting the title to real estate or real property.\n\nSection not applicable to conveyance by decree or master.— The definition of \"real estate\" as contained in this section as originally enacted could not have been intended to control the meaning of the same word in Section 47-1-12 NMSA 1978, relating to conveyance by decree or master.State ex rel. Truitt v. Dist. Court of Ninth Judicial Dist., 1939-NMSC-061, 44 N.M. 16, 96 P.2d 710.\n\nLeaseholds conveyable as personalty.— Though inclusion of leaseholds under this section makes conveyances of leaseholds subject to the rules and procedures that pertain to the conveyance of real property, it does not change them from personal into real property.Resolution Trust Corp. v. Binford, 1992-NMSC-068, 114 N.M. 560, 844 P.2d 810.\n\nLease for a term of years is not real estate.State ex rel. Truitt v. Dist. Court of Ninth Judicial Dist., 1939-NMSC-061, 44 N.M. 16, 96 P.2d 710 (decided prior to 1991 amendment including leaseholds within the definition).\n\nReformation of sublease deemed personal.— An action to reform a sublease with reference to rentals and renewals was strictly personal, and district court was without jurisdiction to enter decree adjudicating issues therein, in the absence of personal service of summons in state of nonresident defendant.State ex rel. Truitt v. Dist. Court of Ninth Judicial Dist., 1939-NMSC-061, 44 N.M. 16, 96 P.2d 710, (decided prior to 1991 amendment including leaseholds within the definition).\n\nSection does not attempt to convert what was personal property at common law into real estate,but only to bring leasehold estates within the compass of the conveyancing statutes.Garrison Gen. Tire Serv., Inc. v. Montgomery, 1965-NMSC-077, 75 N.M. 321, 404 P.2d 143 (decided prior to 1991 amendment including leaseholds within the definition).\n\nLis pendens held valid.— Because the legislature retroactively has validated the filing of interests in leaseholds for giving of constructive notice, and a notice of lis pendens may act merely as constructive notice to third persons of a fact open to public notoriety, the notice of lis pendens is valid.Resolution Trust Corp. v. Binford, 1992-NMSC-068, 114 N.M. 560, 844 P.2d 810.\n\nIntention controls whether chattel considered realty.— Only three general tests have been subscribed to so be applied in determining whether an article used in connection with realty is to be considered a fixture. First, annexation to the realty, either actual or constructive; second, adaptation or application to the use or purpose to which that part of the realty to which it is connected is appropriated; and third, intention to make the article a permanent accession to the freehold. In determining whether personal property loses or retains its identity as a chattel by being placed on land, the general intention of the parties is a controlling factor.Garrison Gen. Tire Serv., Inc. v. Montgomery, 1965-NMSC-077, 75 N.M. 321, 404 P.2d 143.\n\nTownhouse is real estate.— Where plaintiffs purchased a new townhouse and the underlying lot from the builder; the purchase price included gross receipts taxes the builder paid on the value of the townhouse, the lot was realty and the townhouse was a tenement and plaintiff could not deduct the gross receipts taxes on their federal income tax returns on the theory that plaintiffs paid the tax on personal property in the form of the material used to construct the townhouse.Casey v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, 830 F.2d 1092 (10th Cir. 1987).\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Toward Clarification of New Mexico's Real Property Statutes,\" see 1 Nat. Res.

Const., art. IV, §§ 26, 38.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective July 1, 1992, added the section heading and deleted \"Perpetuities and\" from the beginning of the section.\n\nRestricted deed not monopoly.— The prohibition of this section of the creation of monopolies is not violated by restricted deeds (of an improvement company establishing a townsite) which restrict forever the sale of intoxicating liquors in the town to one block, by such persons as are designated by the company, such restriction being for the benefit of the community and without intent to create a monopoly.Alamogordo Improvement Co. v.

In light of the 1991 amendment to 47-1-1 NMSA 1978 by L. 1991, ch. 234, § 3, the reference probably should be to Chapter 47 NMSA 1978.\n\nA voidable deed to a good-faith bona fide purchaser is not subject to cancellation.— Where plaintiffs purchased property that was the subject of ongoing probate litigation in which the decedent's estate sought to set aside a deed from the decedent to the decedent's nephew on the grounds that the deed had been obtained by undue influence; the estate filed a notice of lis pendens after two years of litigation when plaintiffs' grantor purchased the property and was joined as a party to the probate litigation; the estate voluntarily released the lis pendens prior to the conclusion of the litigation when plaintiffs' grantor was dismissed without prejudice as a party to the probate litigation for insufficiency of process; and plaintiffs purchased the property after the lis pendens had been released, but prior to the conclusion of the litigation; plaintiffs gave value for the property and did not have constructive notice of the probate litigation; after plaintiffs purchased the property, the district court found in the probate litigation that the deed from the decedent to the decedent's nephew had been fraudulently obtained, the deed to plaintiffs was merely voidable and if plaintiffs had no actual notice of the probate litigation, plaintiffs would be good-faith bona fide purchasers and the deed of the property to plaintiffs would not be subject to cancellation.Kokoricha v. Estate of Keiner, 2010-NMCA-053, 148 N.M. 322, 236 P.3d 41.\n\nElements of easement by necessity.— To establish an easement by necessity, there must be unity of title, indicating that the dominant and servient parcels were owned as a single parcel prior to the separation, that the dominant parcel had been severed from the servient parcel, thereby curtailing access of the owner of the dominant parcel to and from a public roadway, and that a reasonable necessity existed at the time the dominant parcel was severed from the servient parcel.Ciolli v. McFarland Land & Cattle Co., Inc., 2017-NMCA-037, cert. denied.\n\nWhere plaintiffs, owners of a landlocked ranch in Quay County, sued an adjacent ranch to compel the recognition of an easement across that ranch to the public highway, the district court did not err in its judgment recognizing an implied easement by necessity for the benefit of plaintiffs' ranch, because it was undisputed that the two parcels of land were once owned as a single parcel prior to separation, that legal access to plaintiffs' landlocked property was curtailed by the severance of the original parcel of land, and that a reasonable necessity existed at the time the dominant parcel was severed from the servient parcel, because prior to the severance of the original parcel of land, there was only one legally enforceable access from the original parcel to the public highway, and the necessity for the easement existed at the time of severance.Ciolli v. McFarland Land & Cattle Co., Inc., 2017-NMCA-037, cert. denied.\n\nEasement of necessity.— Where property owned by plaintiffs and defendants originally constituted a portion of the Las Vegas land grant; plaintiffs sought to establish an access easement to their property over a canyon road that ran through defendants' property; at the time of the severance of plaintiffs' property from the land grant, the only reasonable access that existed was from the canyon road; and the district court found that there was a necessity for the grantor to have reserved an easement through its former holdings, which were owned by defendants at the time of severance of plaintiffs' property, the canyon road was the only access available at the time of severance, plaintiffs did not have reasonable alternative access, and the canyon road had provided access to plaintiffs' property since time immemorial, plaintiffs were granted access easements over the canyon road by implication and necessity pursuant to and in conformity with the grants from the Las Vegas land grant.Los Vigiles Land Grant v. Rebar Haygood Ranch, L.L.C., 2014-NMCA-017.\n\nImplied easement by necessity.— To find an implied easement by necessity, the necessity must have arisen as a result of a severance of rights held by a single owner, such as where a single parcel of land is divided into two parcels. The easement by necessity rests heavily upon the intent of the grantor, and unless there is a clear indication to the contrary, the grantor is presumed to have intended to have conveyed to his grantees a means of access to the property in question, so that the land may be beneficially utilized.Firstenberg v. Monribot, 2015-NMCA-062, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-006.\n\nWhere plaintiff claimed that he had an implied easement by necessity to access his electrical meter on defendant's property, testimony from the former owner of the property, that the property originally constituted a single lot upon which the houses of both plaintiff and defendant were located, and that when the former owner split the single lot into two lots granted an express easement for all existing utilities, supported the district court's decision that plaintiff had an implied easement by necessity for the transmission of electricity and for access to the switch and meter attached to defendant's property.Firstenberg v. Monribot, 2015-NMCA-062, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-006.\n\nEasement created by land ownership and well-sharing agreement.— Where the owners of adjoining ranches entered into a written land ownership and well-sharing agreement to clarify the ownership of certain property and to provide for sharing of water from two wells; in the agreement, each landowner quitclaimed certain land to the other landowner on which a water well was located, each landowner reserved the right to go over and across the other landowner's land to obtain water for livestock, and each landowner agreed to maintain the water well on the landowner's land; and the agreement did not state the duration the agreement would be effective or state that it would bind the landowners' successors-in-interest, the agreement created a reciprocal easement appurtenant that ran with the land and placed a duty on each landowner and their successors-in-interest to maintain the water well that was located on the landowners' land and supply water to the other landowner.Skeen v. Boyles, 2009-NMCA-080, 146 N.M. 627, 213 P.3d 531.\n\nExistence and scope of an express easement.— The existence and scope of an express easement are determined according to the intent of the parties, and the intent of the parties is derived from language of the agreement. The written language of an easement should be conclusive, and consideration of extrinsic evidence is generally inappropriate, but if the easement language is ambiguous, the parties' intention must be determined from the language of the instrument as well as from the surrounding circumstances.Mayer v. Smith, 2015-NMCA-060, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-004.\n\nWhere plaintiff owned property burdened by an easement, but erected a fence that encroached onto the easement, the district court erred in using extrinsic evidence to determine the parties' intent when the easement agreement at issue was unambiguous in that it listed the purpose of the easement, clearly set out the dominant estate holders, unequivocally set forth the dimensions and location of the easement, and the agreement's duration was unlimited. The district court erred in restricting the scope and ownership of the easement and in allowing plaintiff's fence to stand.Mayer v. Smith, 2015-NMCA-060, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-004.\n\nEasements cannot be expanded, changed, or modified to create an additional burden on the servient estate.— The owner of the dominant estate cannot change the extent of the easement or subject the servient estate to an additional burden not contemplated by the grant of easement.Mayer v. Smith, 2015-NMCA-060, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-004.\n\nWhere plaintiff owned property burdened by an easement, but erected a fence that encroached onto the easement, the fact that the dominant estate had been divided did not create an additional burden on the servient estate because an increase in the number of persons holding the benefit of the servitude alone does not constitute an unreasonable increase in the burden, and where evidence established that there had been no change to the use of the easement since it was purchased in 1979 and that the easement had not been modified by the division of the dominant estate, the district court's finding of an additional burden to the servient estate was not supported by the evidence.Mayer v. Smith, 2015-NMCA-060, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-004.\n\nEasements cannot be used to benefit property that is not appurtenant to the easement.— Where plaintiff, a condominium association responsible for the administration, management, operation, and control of the common elements of the Acequia Compound Condominium property, which is property located at the southern end of a public street in Santa Fe, New Mexico and which contains a property easement that runs along the west side of the condominium property, filed a complaint for trespass and injunctive relief against defendant, alleging that defendant was trespassing and causing or permitting others to trespass on the condominium property, and where defendant claimed that the New Mexico Association of Counties (NMAC) had authorized defendant to use the condominium property easement which was next to the NMAC's property, and where the district court, in its partial grant of summary judgment, permanently prohibited defendant from using the condominium property easement across plaintiff's property, but denied plaintiff's request for an injunction requiring defendant to erect a fence or other permanent barrier on the northern boundary of plaintiff's property, the district court did not err in partially granting plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the trespass claim, because the general rule is that easements cannot be used to benefit property that is not appurtenant to the easement and defendant's property was not appurtenant to the condominium property easement.Acequia Compound Owners' Ass'n v. Orchard Metal Cap. Corp., 2023-NMCA-006, cert. granted.\n\nAdmissibility of extrinsic evidence to resolve ambiguities in easements.— Extrinsic evidence has been allowed to resolve ambiguities in easements when necessary terms are omitted, when the terms of an easement are subject to more than a single reasonable construction, to resolve conflicting terms of an easement, and when the granting language is not itself technically accurate.Dethlefsen v. Weddle, 2012-NMCA-077, 284 P.3d 452.\n\nEasement was ambiguous in scope.— Where plaintiffs' deed conveyed a tract of land subject to a \"fifty foot wide road easement to and across the property as shown on\" a recorded plat; the plat described the easement as a \"road & 50' wide easement follows approx. c/l of Monument Creek\" and \"easement extends to forest service road\"; the plat showed that the easement originated at a forest service road on property on the east side of plaintiffs' property, traversed that property and then plaintiffs' property, and connected with property on the west side of plaintiffs' property; because the use of the term \"road\" was not definitive as to the specific nature and purpose of the easement, the easement failed to disclose terms necessary to an understanding of precisely what was conveyed; the easement failed to identify each of the dominate estate holders and to state the duration of the easement; the descriptions of the easement in the deed and in the plat were subject to different interpretations as to exactly what had been reserved; the fifty foot width of the road in a rural setting was unusual; the easement was unclear as to whether the road, the easement, or both, followed the center line of Monument Creek; the ambiguities in plaintiffs' deed were not resolved by the recorded deeds to the adjoining property, neither of which located or referenced the easement in wording consistent with each other or with plaintiffs' deed or the plat, specified a width or consistent specific use for the road, or stated whether the easement was appurtenant or in gross; and the deeds that created and referenced the easement were silent as to the inclusion of a lockable gate on the easement at any location, the scope of the easement was ambiguous as a matter of law with respect to the width of the road, the location of the road within or separate from the fifty-foot wide easement, the use, nature, and purpose of the road, and the permissibility of a lockable gate.Dethlefsen v. Weddle, 2012-NMCA-077, 284 P.3d 452.\n\nSufficient evidence of the creation of an express easement.— Where plaintiffs' deed conveyed part of a larger tract of land subject to a \"fifty foot wide road easement to and across the property as shown on\" a recorded plat; the plat described the easement as \"road & 50' wide easement follows approx. c/l of Monument Creek\" and \"easement extends to forest service road\"; the plat showed that the easement originated at a forest service road on property on the east side of plaintiffs' property, traversed that property and then plaintiffs' property, and connected with property on the west side of plaintiffs' property; plaintiffs' property and the property on the east side of plaintiffs' property were held by a common grantor at the time the plat was surveyed; and the language of plaintiff's deed indicated that the grantor intended to reserve an easement \"across\" plaintiff's property and to grant easement access \"to\" plaintiff's property, there was sufficient evidence of the grantors' intent to create an express easement over the property on the east side of plaintiffs' property where the easement originated.Dethlefsen v. Weddle, 2012-NMCA-077, 284 P.3d 452.\n\nTimber reservation.— Where a deed reserved all timber measuring 18 inches in circumference measured 18 inches above the ground, together with the rights of ingress and egress for the purpose of harvesting and removing the timber for the benefit of the original grantors and their heirs and assigns, the reservation was a limited estate that terminated after a reasonable time.Marrujo v. Sanderson, 2008-NMCA-112, 144 N.M. 730, 191 P.3d 588.\n\nAn estate in timber is presumed to be of limited duration, unless the parties provide a clear expression of intent to establish a perpetual fee simple interest.Marrujo v. Sanderson, 2008-NMCA-112, 144 N.M. 730, 191 P.3d 588.\n\nProvisions provide greater formality and certainty in the transfer of realty.McBee v. O'Connell, 1911-NMSC-049, 16 N.M. 469, 120 P. 734.\n\nWriting affecting realty must conform to statutory requirements.— The effect of the language of this section is such - so restrictive - that any writing affecting real estate, in law or equity, is of force, or valuable, so far only as it may be in accordance with the requirements of the statute. If such writing does not conform to the requirements of the statute, it has no force and is valueless.Edgar v. Baca, 1875-NMSC-001, 1 N.M. 613.\n\nSection not applicable to wills.— This section has to do only with conveyances inter vivos, and has no application to wills.Plomteaux v. Solano, 1918-NMSC-104, 25 N.M. 24, 176 P. 77.\n\nLand received under United States grant alienable.— There is nothing in the language of a patent to indicate any intention that there should be any restraint upon alienation, where lands were described in a grant from the United States to named grantees, being \"inhabitants of the town of Cevoletta, their successors and assigns,\" which was evidenced by a patent with the recital: to have and to hold such lands unto said inhabitants, their successors and assigns forever with the stipulations aforesaid, and lands so granted can be divested by voluntary or involuntary means and are subject to prescription, for title to common and unallotted lands of a community grant can be acquired by adverse possession.L Bar Cattle Co. v. Board of Trustees, 1941-NMSC-057, 46 N.M. 26, 120 P.2d 432, appeal dismissed, 316 U.S. 645, 62 S. Ct. 1108, 86 L. Ed. 1729 (1942).\n\nConveyance of fee with life estate in grantor.— If a deed is otherwise properly executed and acknowledged, contains words of conveyance ordinarily found in deeds, and delivered to the grantee, the fact that the deed recites that it is to take effect only upon death of grantor, does not render the deed testamentary in character, but rather conveys a fee title postponing possession during the life of the grantor.Vigil v. Sandoval, 1987-NMCA-101, 106 N.M. 233, 741 P.2d 836.\n\nEquitable title acquired held unaffected by subsequent congressional actions.— The Alien Act of Congress approved March 3, 1887, did not apply to executory contracts for the sale of land under which equitable titles had been acquired in good faith.Potter v. Rio Arriba Land & Cattle Co., 1888-NMSC-014, 4 N.M. (Gild.) 649, 17 P. 609.\n\nWritten instruments essential.— Under the civil law as it existed in New Mexico in 1868, written instruments were essential for the sale of land.Maxwell Land Grant Co. v. Dawson, 151 U.S. 586, 14 S. Ct. 458, 38 L. Ed. 279 (1894).\n\nSubstantially performed and satisfactorily proved oral agreement specifically enforceable.— An oral agreement to devise property in consideration of personal services, which is substantially performed and is established by satisfactory proof, may be enforced in equity by specific performance, notwithstanding the statute of frauds.Estate of McGee, 1942-NMSC-024, 46 N.M. 256, 127 P.2d 239;Paulos v.

Thomas, 1954-NMSC-034, 58 N.M. 190, 269 P.2d 741.\n\nOption may be terminated by failing to perform the terms of the option.Where the parties entered into a realtors form purchase agreement whereby plaintiffs agreed to sell a 25 acre tract to defendant for $750,000, with a down payment of $150,000 and a loan of $600,000; the word \"Option\" was hand written after the title of the form purchase agreement and under the heading \"Cash or Financing Conditions and Obligations\" the purchase agreement stated \"Real Estate Option. For terms, see attached addendum\"; the purchase agreement did not provide for a closing date; the parties subsequently entered into an option agreement, which provided that the consideration for the grant of the option was $750,000, with $150,000 down payment and annual payments of $100,000 plus interest and for a closing after defendant provided notice of intent to exercise the option; defendant failed to pay an annual payment; and plaintiffs sued defendant for breach of contract to recover the sales price on the grounds that plaintiffs had sold the property under an installment purchase agreement, because the original purchase agreement expressed the parties' intent to create an option and the option agreement clarified their intent, defendant had the unilateral option to either make annual payments and exercise the option or cease making payments and thereby not exercise the option, plaintiffs were not entitled to enforce the option agreement, and defendant had the right to not exercise the option by making a payment.Garcia v.

In any litigation involving the issue of such tenancy a preponderance of the evidence shall be sufficient to establish the same.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 70-1-14.1, enacted by Laws 1955, ch. 174, § 1.\n\nSection applies to bank accounts.Kinney v.

Blake, 1985-NMCA-009, 102 N.M. 354, 695 P.2d 838.\n\nJoint tenancy created.— Execution of a joint tenancy deed by a husband, putting separate property in the names of the husband and wife, creates a joint tenancy, not community property.Hughes v. Hughes, 1981-NMSC-110, 96 N.M. 719, 634 P.2d 1271.\n\nParol evidence may be looked at to determine grantor's intentand the parties' understanding in establishing whether a deed created a joint tenancy, except where purchaser or encumbrancers for value are involved.Ohl v. Ohl, 1981-NMSC-128, 97 N.M. 175, 637 P.2d 1230.\n\nExistence and nonexistence of joint tenancy both proved by preponderance.— The words \"the same\" in the last sentence of this section refer back to \"the issue of such tenancy.\" If joint tenancy is \"in issue,\" its existence is to be resolved, and the negative would seem to be as much included as the affirmative. If the legislature had intended the negative to require a greater quantum of proof than the affirmative, it is reasonable to suppose that it would have said so.Kinney v. Ewing, 1972-NMSC-001, 83 N.M. 365, 492 P.2d 636.\n\nCommunity funds used with no intention to establish joint tenancy creates no such tenancy.— Because it was not the intention of husband and wife to hold the property as joint tenants, and because community funds were used to purchase the property, the trial court properly concluded that a joint tenancy was not created.Wiggins v. Rush, 1971-NMSC-092, 83 N.M. 133, 489 P.2d 641.\n\nPresumption against joint tenancy.— If separate property has been so commingled or mixed with property acquired after marriage so that the separate property cannot be clearly traced or identified, then there is a presumption that the property acquired after marriage is community property, and not held in joint tenancy, unless this presumption can be overcome by proof.Wiggins v.

In addition, Section 47-1-36 NMSA 1978 requires that the document purporting to create the joint tenancy include express language that the real property is to be held jointly.Edwin Smith, LLC v.

A conveyance by a joint tenant of the joint tenant's interest to a third party, an express agreement between all of the joint tenants, or any conduct or course of dealing sufficient to indicate that all parties have mutually treated their interests as belonging to them in common will sever a joint tenancy.Edwin Smith, LLC v.

      "text": "Any agreement entered into subsequent to the first day of July, 1949, authorizing or employing an agent or broker to purchase or sell lands, tenements or hereditaments or any interest in or concerning them, for a commission or other compensation, shall be void unless the agreement, or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writing and signed by the person to be charged therewith, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized. No such agreement or employment shall be considered exclusive unless specifically so stated therein.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 75-143, enacted by Laws 1949, ch. 19, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 70-1-43.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nPurpose of sectionis to protect the owner-broker agreement to pay commissions but not to protect the brokers from themselves; therefore, this section is not applicable to agreements between brokers to share a commission.Hapsas Realty, Inc. v. McCoun, 1978-NMSC-037, 91 N.M. 659, 579 P.2d 785.\n\nSection is extension of statute of fraudsand may not be used as an instrument to perpetrate a fraud.Lindsey v. Cranfill, 1956-NMSC-055, 61 N.M. 228, 297 P.2d 1055,rev'd in part on other grounds,Carney v. McGinnis, 1961-NMSC-006, 68 N.M. 68, 358 P.2d 694;Harris v. Dunn, 1951-NMSC-061, 55 N.M. 434, 234 P.2d 821.\n\nNoncomplying brokerage contracts void.— The legislature, having used the word \"void\" in contrast to the words of the original statute, has thereby shown an intention that noncomplying brokerage contracts should be treated differently than noncomplying contracts for an interest in realty or contracts not to be performed within a year; the latter types are merely unenforceable while the former is null and void.Adams v. Thompson, 1974-NMCA-133, 87 N.M. 113, 529 P.2d 1234, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232.\n\nNoncomplying contract void as to all parties.— \"Any agreement\" for a commission is void if the agreement does not comply with the requirements set forth in this section. This section does not say that an agreement is void only when contrary to the interest of the owner; it applies equally to all who come within its provisions.Yrisarri v. Wallis, 1966-NMSC-177, 76 N.M. 776, 418 P.2d 852.\n\nWriting requirement to prevent fraudulent claims.— This section is designed to prevent brokers from claiming commissions on transactions where they had never been authorized to sell - thus, the requirement that the same be in writing.Carney v. McGinnis, 1961-NMSC-006, 68 N.M. 68, 358 P.2d 694.\n\nSection applies only to realty.— In view of the maxim \"expressio unius est exclusio alterius\" this section deals with contracts relating to things of permanent nature and things capable of being inherited with land, as distinguished from personal property.Hart v. Warder, 1953-NMSC-003, 57 N.M. 14, 252 P.2d 515.\n\nSection cannot be extended to embrace contracts relating to personalty.Hart v. Warder, 57 N.M. 14, 252 P.2d 515.\n\nSection applies to contract to negotiate lease.— While a lease is personalty, the leasehold estate is an interest in land; therefore, when the owner of real estate engages a broker to negotiate a lease of that real estate for a term of years the transaction is the sale of an \"interest in or concerning\" land. Therefore, this section applies to the commission arrangement between parties.Yrisarri v. Wallis, 1966-NMSC-177, 76 N.M. 776, 418 P.2d 852 (decided prior to 1991 amendment to Section 47-1-1 NMSA 1978 including leaseholds in the definition of real estate).\n\nBroker's recovery not contingent on sale.— It is immaterial as between the real estate brokers and owners that no enforceable contract was ever consummated between the owner and the prospective purchaser.Carney v. McGinnis, 1958-NMSC-001, 63 N.M. 439, 321 P.2d 626.\n\nBroker's recovery contingent when broker not employed by buyer or seller.— Where the binder agreement relied on by the broker did not grow out of any employment agreement between the seller and broker, there was no independent contract of employment with either the purchaser or the seller. Under such circumstances, the provision relating to the payment of a commission is not separable from the remainder of the contract, but contingent upon the consummation of the purpose for which the binder agreement was made.Brown v. Horn, 1962-NMSC-100, 70 N.M. 303, 373 P.2d 542.\n\nEquitable remedy against fraud.— This section, declaring void, unless in writing, all agreements made subsequent to July 1, 1949, employing an agent to purchase or sell real estate does not bar equitable relief against one agreeing to purchase certain land for another but in violation of his promise and understanding purchases it for himself, taking title in the name of others in an effort to conceal the fraudulent breach of his agreement.Harris v. Dunn, 1951-NMSC-061, 55 N.M. 434, 234 P.2d 821.\n\nParol contract not removed by partial performance.— The part performance of services under a parol contract not to be performed within a year does not remove the contract from the operation of the statute of frauds.Bosque Farms Home Ctr., Inc. v. Tabet Lumber Co., 1988-NMSC-027, 107 N.M. 115, 753 P.2d 894.\n\nConduct may cancel exclusive listing contract.— The real estate broker, through his actions, effectively consented to cancellation of the exclusive listing agreement pursuant to the cancellation provision provided for in the written agreement between broker and seller. Cancellation of written contracts are not required to be in writing where seller, via contract, has the ability to cancel the contract.Dave Zerwas Co. v. James Hamilton Constr. Co., 1994-NMSC-068, 117 N.M. 724, 876 P.2d 653.\n\nConstructive trust available.— Though section requires brokerage agreement to be in writing, a broker employed to purchase land under an oral contract who buys the land for himself, may be held accountable as a constructive trustee of the party by whom the broker was employed.Harris v. Dunn, 1951-NMSC-061, 55 N.M. 434, 234 P.2d 821.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Vendor and Purchaser - Increased Risks of Forfeiture and Malpractice Resulting from the Use of Real Estate Contracts: Albuquerque National Bank v. Albuquerque Ranch Estates, Inc.,\" see 15 N.M.L. Rev. 99 (1985).\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 12 Am. Jur. 2d Brokers §§ 38 to 53.\n\n12 C.J.S. Brokers §§ 121 to 124.\n\nII. WRITTEN CONTRACT OR MEMORANDUM.\n\nContract entered into must be in writingto support a recovery under this section. Nichols v. Sefcik, 66 N.M. 449, 349 P.2d 678 (1960).\n\nStatement of compensation or commission to be paid is vital part of contract,and unless there is some memorandum in writing stating the amount of the commission, signed by the person to be charged or his agent, the contract cannot be enforced. Carney v. McGinnis, 68 N.M. 68, 358 P.2d 694 (1961).\n\nStatement not necessary to specify amount in contract.— This section does not necessarily require that the amount of the commission be specifically set out in the contract itself, so long as this can be proven by some memorandum in writing, signed by the party or his agent, so as to be a protection against fraud. Carney v. McGinnis, 68 N.M. 68, 358 P.2d 694 (1961).\n\n\"Memorandum\" includes all essential terms.— Where owner's written binder contained all the essential terms and conditions of their agreement with the real estate broker, including the commission to be paid and to whom, and the instrument was signed by both, it was a \"memorandum or note\" meeting fully the requirements of this section. Carney v. McGinnis, 63 N.M. 439, 321 P.2d 626 (1958).\n\nSigned statement admitting oral contract sufficient.— Writings to be sufficient under the statute of frauds need not in themselves amount to a contract or be addressed to the other party, but are sufficient as evidence if the person to be bound signs any statement or document in which he admits that the parties made the oral contract, sufficiently stating therein its essential terms. Traub v. Nason & Childers, 57 N.M. 473, 260 P.2d 379 (1953).\n\nSignature required.— Where memorandum relied upon as fixing liability for broker's commission was neither signed by wife in her name nor by anyone else thereunto duly authorized, the trial court was correct in dismissing complaint as against wife. Ginn v. MacAluso, 62 N.M. 375, 310 P.2d 1034 (1957).\n\nSignature by agent valid.— Where memorandum relied upon as fixing liability for broker's commission is signed with the husband's name by his wife, with his express consent and direction, he alone is liable. Ginn v. MacAluso, 62 N.M. 375, 310 P.2d 1034 (1957).\n\nAgency may be oral.— A real estate listing is binding on the principal if the purported agent was in fact an agent for such purpose under the general law of agency, and such an agency may be created by parol or estoppel, and proven by circumstantial evidence. Kennedy v. Justus, 64 N.M. 131, 325 P.2d 716 (1958).\n\nCollateral papers must be referred to in faulty memorandumitself before they can become a part of it. Traub v. Nason & Childers, 57 N.M. 473, 260 P.2d 379 (1953).\n\nCollateral papers not incorporated.— Where one paragraph of a sales contract specified that sellers would pay a commission on the sale to a broker whose written listing agreement had expired and with whom sellers had only an oral contract, it was held that the paragraph did not operate to take the oral agreement out of the statute of frauds because it did not contain the amount of commission nor refer to the expired listing so as to incorporate it. Adams v. Thompson, 87 N.M. 113, 529 P.2d 1234 (Ct. App.), cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232 (1974).\n\nOral contract not proved by previous writing.— A contract wholly oral, and within the statute of frauds, may not be proved by a writing made prior to the meeting of the minds of the parties. Bosque Farms Home Ctr., Inc. v. Tabet Lumber Co., 107 N.M. 115, 753 P.2d 894 (1988).\n\nIII. MODIFICATION.\n\nOral evidence is inadmissible to show subsequent modificationof the written agreement. Yrisarri v. Wallis, 76 N.M. 776, 418 P.2d 852 (1966).\n\nExtension must be written.— The contract attempted to be voided by oral agreement was a definite contract signed by the owner that he would pay a commission if the property was sold \"before the expiration of the agreement.\" The oral agreement was a new contract affecting the time of performance, and, by substituting a new time of performance, varied an essential term of the written contract. This new contract concerning the commission would be subject to the provisions of this section and such an agreement must be in writing. Yrisarri v. Wallis, 76 N.M. 776, 418 P.2d 852 (1966).\n\nNo ratification of oral extension.— As this section is an extension of the statute of frauds its rationale is equally applicable here. A contract within the statute of frauds, that has expired by its terms, cannot be revived and extended by parol agreement. Thus, there could be no ratification of an oral extension of a listing agreement. Adams v. Thompson, 87 N.M. 113, 529 P.2d 1234 (Ct. App.), cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232 (1974).\n\nAcceptance of lower price not modification.— Where the written agreement between parties provides for payment of a commission of a percentage of the \"selling price\" on any acceptable selling price, the completion of the sale at a lower price does not change the terms or conditions of the written agreement, and the broker is entitled to full recovery. Herrell v. Piner, 78 N.M. 664, 437 P.2d 125 (1968); Taylor v. Unger, 65 N.M. 3, 330 P.2d 965 (1958).\n\nPrice modification not exclusiveness modification.— Fact that there was a modification of the $100,000 sale price as expressed in the written agreement does not modify the exclusiveness of the listing. Herrell v. Piner, 78 N.M. 664, 437 P.2d 125 (1968).",

      "text": "Any deed, mortgage, pleading in court or other instrument affecting real estate may describe such real estate by reference to the description thereof contained in or shown by one or more maps, plats, descriptions, deeds, mortgages or other instruments of record in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the affected real estate is located, and such instrument containing such description or descriptions by reference shall be legally sufficient for all purposes to the same extent as if the description or descriptions referred to therein had been fully set forth therein; provided, that the instrument containing any such description by reference must show the time and place of filing or recordation of the instrument containing the description referred to, or other similar information, so that said instrument containing the description referred to can be located and identified.\n\nHistory:1941 Comp., § 75-123, enacted by Laws 1943, ch. 90, § 1; 1953 Comp., § 70-1-44.\n\nSection is applicable to tax deeds.Hughes v. Meem, 1962-NMSC-039, 70 N.M. 122, 371 P.2d 235.\n\nDescription may appear in separate instrument referred to in deed.— It is not necessary that the description of the land be contained in the body of the deed. It is sufficient if it refers for identification to some other instrument or document, but the description must be contained in the instrument or its reference, express or implied, with such certainty that the locality of the land can be ascertained. This rule has also been held to apply to maps and plats, including surveys, and to an assessor's plan. The deed is not void because the instrument referred to is incomplete, not official, unacknowledged, unrecorded or unattached, or is misdescribed in some particular, or even invalid.Hughes v. Meem, 1962-NMSC-039, 70 N.M. 122, 371 P.2d 235.\n\nDescription enables identification of land.— The purpose of a description of the land, which is the subject matter of a deed of conveyance, is to identify such subject matter; and it may be laid down as a broad general principle that a deed will not be declared void for uncertainty in description if it is possible by any reasonable rules of construction to ascertain from the description, aided by extrinsic evidence, what property is intended to be conveyed. It is sufficient if the description in the deed or conveyance furnishes a means of identification of the land or by which the property conveyed can be located. So, if a surveyor with the deed before him can, with the aid of extrinsic evidence if necessary, locate the land and establish its boundaries, the description therein is sufficient.Hughes v. Meem, 1962-NMSC-039, 70 N.M. 122, 371 P.2d 235.\n\nExtrinsic evidence allowed.— This section is permissive. A deed may describe real estate by reference but the section is not mandatory. Its purpose is not to preclude extrinsic evidence. Whether the map was filed in the clerk's office is wholly immaterial.Hughes v. Meem, 1962-NMSC-039, 70 N.M. 122, 371 P.2d 235.\n\nAm.

The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian 104 20' west of Greenwich and the parallel 31 00' north latitude;\n\n(2) the New Mexico coordinate system, central zone, is a transverse mercator projection having a central meridian 106 15' west of Greenwich, on which meridian the scale is set at one part in 10,000 too small. The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian 106 15' west of Greenwich and the parallel 31 00' north latitude;\n\n(3) the New Mexico coordinate system, west zone, is a transverse mercator projection having a central meridian 107 50' west of Greenwich, on which meridian the scale is set at one part in 12,000 too small. The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian 107 50' west of Greenwich and the parallel 31 00' north latitude; and\n\n(4) the origin for each zone is assigned the coordinates: x = 500,000 feet and y = 0 feet for the New Mexico coordinate system of 1927. The origin for the east zone is assigned to the coordinates: x = 165,000 meters and y = 0 meters, for the central zone x = 500,000 meters and y = 0 meters and for the west zone x = 830,000 meters and y = 0 meters for the New Mexico coordinate system of 1983.\n\nB. The position of the New Mexico coordinate system shall be as marked on the ground by horizontal control stations established in conformity with standards adopted by the national ocean survey and national geodetic survey for first-order, second-order and third-order work, whose geodetic positions have been rigidly adjusted on the North American datum of 1927 or of 1983, and whose coordinates have been computed on the system defined in this section.
