      "text": "Chapter 47, Article 6 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"New Mexico Subdivision Act\".\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 70-5-1, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 348, § 1; 1995, ch. 212, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For Land Subdivision Act,see47-5-1 to 47-5-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1996, substituted \"Chapter 47, Article 6, NMSA 1978\" for \"Sections 1 through 30 and Sections 37 and 42 of this act\".\n\nStrict construction.— The subdivision statute is an enactment in derogation of the common law constituting restrictions upon the free use of property and must be strictly construed against the state in its attempt to enforce the statute.State v. Heck, 1991-NMCA-076, 112 N.M. 513, 817 P.2d 247.\n\nArticle was not designed to protect landowners owning land adjoining land being subdivided.Gabaldon v. Sanchez, 1978-NMCA-103, 92 N.M. 224, 585 P.2d 1105.\n\nPlat approval a ministerial act under prior law.— Before the passage of the New Mexico Subdivision Act, the board of county commissioners had nothing to do but the ministerial act of endorsing its approval on plats which complied with all statutory requirements for rural subdivisions, and mandamus was a proper remedy when it refused to do so.El Dorado at Santa Fe, Inc. v. Board of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1976-NMSC-029, 89 N.M. 313, 551 P.2d 1360.\n\nTracts forming part of the same land area.— Tracts need not be contiguous to form part of the same area of land for purposes of the New Mexico Subdivision Act. Physical distances, common streets and utilities, and historical unity are considerations that might be evaluated in an appropriate case.State v. Heck, 1991-NMCA-076, 112 N.M. 513, 817 P.2d 247.\n\nEffect of city's summary approval of subdivision plans.— Summary approval of subdivision plans by the city of Las Cruces did not obviate the need for compliance with the New Mexico Subdivision Act and approval by the Dona Ana County board of commissioners.State v. Heck, 1991-NMCA-076, 112 N.M. 513, 817 P.2d 247.\n\nPurchasers defaulting on agreements.— The fact that certain purchasers defaulted on their agreements did not change the fact that the act of subdividing land for the purpose of sale triggered the New Mexico Subdivision Act.State v. Heck, 1991-NMCA-076, 112 N.M. 513, 817 P.2d 247.\n\nSufficient evidence to support finding of violation.State ex rel. Stratton v.

provided further that a survey, and a deed if a parcel is subsequently conveyed, shall be filed with the county clerk indicating that the parcel shall be subject to the provisions of the New Mexico Subdivision Act if the parcel is further divided within five years of the date of the division of the original tract of land;\n\nN. \"terrain management\" means the control of floods, drainage and erosion and measures required for adapting proposed development to existing soil characteristics and topography;\n\nO. \"time of purchase, lease or other conveyance\" means the time of signing any document obligating the person signing the document to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire a legal interest in land;\n\nP. \"type-one subdivision\" means any subdivision containing five hundred or more parcels, any one of which is less than ten acres in size;\n\nQ. \"type-two subdivision\" means any subdivision containing not fewer than twenty-five but not more than four hundred ninety-nine parcels, any one of which is less than ten acres in size;\n\nR. \"type-three subdivision\" means any subdivision containing not more than twenty-four parcels, any one of which is less than ten acres in size;\n\nS. \"type-four subdivision\" means any subdivision containing twenty-five or more parcels, each of which is ten acres or more in size; and\n\nT. \"type-five subdivision\" means any subdivision containing not more than twenty-four parcels, each of which is ten acres or more in size.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 70-5-2, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 348, § 2; 1979, ch. 172, § 1; 1981, ch. 148, § 1; 1995, ch. 212, § 2; 2005, ch. 139, § 1; 2009, ch. 65, § 1; 2013, ch. 96, § 1.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective June 14, 2013, clarified an exception to the definition of \"subdivision\", deleted former Paragraph 13 of Subsection M, which excepted the conveyance of a single tract of land within a five-year period; and added Paragraph (13) of Subsection M.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective June 19, 2009, added Subsection E.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added a definition of \"board of county commissioners\", moved the definition of \"common promotional plan\" in former Subsection M to Subsection B and moved the definition of \"final plat\" in former Subsection E to Subsection C.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1996, rewrote the section to such an extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nFamily transfer.— Where a partnership of two families divided eighty acres into four twenty-acre parcels and deeded two twenty-acre parcels to each family; each husband then deeded to his wife one twenty-acre tract; the parties then filed a family transfer application pursuant to the Santa Fe County Land Development Code to allow each landowner to deed his or her spouse one-half of each twenty-acre parcel which, if approved, would have resulted in eight ten-acre lots with each lot separately owned by one of the landowners; the Code provided for minimum lot size family transfers and for small lot family transfers; the minimum lot size family transfer provisions had no intent or purpose requirements; the small lot family transfer provisions provided that the purpose of the small lot family transfer was to maintain local cultural values by perpetuating and protecting a traditional method of land transfer within families and imposed requirements to achieve that purpose; and the County Development Review Board denied the landowners' minimum size lot family transfer application on the ground that the transfer did not meet the intent and purpose of the small lot family transfer provisions of the Code, the Board's decision was unreasonable and unlawful.Kirkpatrick v. Santa Fe Cnty. Bd. of Comm'rs, 2009-NMCA-110, 147 N.M. 127, 217 P.3d 613.\n\nMobile home park.— Mobile home park project was a \"subdivision\" as contemplated by the county's planning and platting ordinance, the New Mexico Subdivision Act, and the village's subdivision ordinances.Sandoval Cnty. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Ruiz, 1995-NMCA-023, 119 N.M. 586, 893 P.2d 482.\n\nMere division of land is not subdivision:there must be proof that at some time prior to alienation, there has been a division of one parcel into five or more, and that the dividing was done so that the smaller parcels could be sold or leased.State ex rel. Anaya v. Select W. Lands, Inc., 1979-NMCA-161, 94 N.M. 555, 613 P.2d 425, cert. quashed, 94 N.M. 675, 615 P.2d 992 (1980).\n\nOwner must manifest fact of division before parcels offered for sale.— The owner must manifest by some overt conduct a clear indication that a division has already taken place before the parcels are offered for sale.State ex rel. Anaya v. Select W. Lands, Inc., 1979-NMCA-161, 94 N.M. 555, 613 P.2d 425, cert. quashed, 94 N.M. 675, 615 P.2d 992 (1980).\n\nDivision of lot into two lots was \"subdivision\".— Seller's division of twenty-acre plot into two ten-acre plots, although allegedly made in order to help buyer acquire financing, was nonetheless a \"subdivision\" of the property; because seller, as a result, had subdivided the land five times in three years, seller became a \"subdivider\" within the meaning of former Subsection I, and was therefore subject under this act to the state's action for costs of platting and basic infrastructure.State ex rel. Udall v. Cresswell, 1998-NMCA-072, 125 N.M. 276, 960 P.2d 818, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 147, 958 P.2d 105.\n\nOrder not authorized.— Order obtained by attorney general compelling performance by defendant subdividers of a duty that the Act imposes only on a subdivider of a larger subdivision was not authorized under the Act.State ex rel. Stratton v. Alto Land & Cattle Co., 1991-NMCA-146, 113 N.M. 276, 824 P.2d 1078.\n\nCounty subdivision ordinance applies to RV parks.— New Mexico courts have held that a mobile home park is a subdivision as contemplated by the New Mexico Subdivision Act, 47-6-1 to 47-6-29 NMSA 1978, and other states that have considered the issue have similarly concluded that RV parks and mobile home communities constitute subdivisions; the definition of a \"subdivision\" in the Eddy County Subdivision Ordinance is almost identical to the one found in the New Mexico Subdivision Act, and therefore the Eddy county subdivision ordinance applies to RV parks and man camps where spaces are leased to members of the public.Applicability of the Eddy County Subdivision Ordinance to RV Parks or Man Camps(11/30/2022), Att'y Gen. Adv. Ltr. 2022-09.\n\nParty dividing land need not own the land outright in fee simplein order to be subdivider; he need only be creating a subdivision. 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-19.\n\nSubdivider includes purchaser under executory real estate contract.— The definition of a \"subdivider\" includes an individual who is a purchaser under an executory real estate contract which provides for rescission or forfeiture for a breach of certain covenants. 1978 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-19.\n\nWhen resubdivision must comply with current subdivision standards.— The later resubdivision or alteration of or amendment to pre-1973 subdivisions must comply with the new, current subdivision standards if such resubdivision activity substantially affects the new regulated areas of concern which are addressed by the new 1973 New Mexico Subdivision Act (i.e., sufficiency of water, quality of water, roads, etc.). 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-11.\n\nIf the county commission determines that amendments to a pre-1973 plat are merely minor adjustments of boundaries, the amendments fall within the scope of the Subsection I(7) exemption, and no reevaluation under the 1973 New Mexico Subdivision Act is triggered. If the commission concludes, on the other hand, that the plat amendments constitute a major revision of the original subdivision, the 1973 standards apply. In either event, the county commission must examine the proposed amendments to the old plats to make such a determination. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-11.\n\nIf proposed alterations to a pre-1973 subdivision involve a wholesale vacating of an entire platted area and subsequent transfer of those vacated lots into a previously unplatted area, such resubdivision efforts rise to the level of an entirely new subdivision which would require the subdivider to apply for subdivision approval under the 1973 New Mexico Subdivision Act as a \"new\" subdivision. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-11.\n\nDivision of lot into four lots not \"subdivision\".— The division of a lot in an approved subdivision into four or fewer lots by a purchaser does not constitute a \"subdivision\" under the New Mexico Subdivision Act. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-04.\n\nDivision of land upon dissolution of partnership not a subdivision.— A partnership of two individuals subdivided and sold four parcels from within an original tract and retained ownership over the remaining acreage in the name of the partnership. Thereafter the partnership dissolved and the remaining property was divided between the two former partners through an exchange of quit claim deeds. The existing divisions and sales do not now constitute a \"subdivision\" within the meaning of the act. Only four parcels have been subdivided and sold. Although a further division took place into two parcels upon dissolution of the partnership, such a subdivision would not be for the purpose of sale or lease so long as the parcels are retained by the owners of the original tract. 1977 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 77-22.\n\nPartnership's subdivisions are added to subsequent individual transfers.— However, if either former partner subdivides and sells or leases one more parcel from within the original tract, the entire tract would become a \"subdivision\" within the meaning of this section. 1977 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 77-22.\n\nCounty cannot extend \"subdivision\" time limit beyond three years.— Since this section sets forth a three-year time limit, a county commission cannot, by regulation, extend the definition of \"subdivision\" to divisions of land over five years. 1981 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-02.",

Acceptance of offers of dedication on a final plat shall not be effective until the final plat is filed in the office of the county clerk or a resolution of acceptance by the board of county commissioners is filed in such office.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 70-5-5, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 348, § 5; 1981, ch. 148, § 2; 1995, ch. 212, § 5.\n\nCross references.— For record of survey requirements,see61-23-28.2 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1996, rewrote the section to such an extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nThe 1981 amendmentadded \"maintenance\" at the end of the section heading and added the last two sentences in the section.\n\nFormal county acceptance is requiredunder the Subdivision Act to obligate the county for road maintenance and such acceptance cannot be satisfied through the common law doctrines of prescriptive acquisition or implied dedication.McGarry v. Scott, 2003-NMSC-016, 134 N.M. 32, 72 P.3d 608.\n\nPublic use of a road, school bus routes, and postal service do not establish an acceptance by a county of road maintenance obligations; such acts do not unequivocally show intent to assume jurisdiction, particularly in the face of filed disclosure forms that clearly show county rejection of maintenance obligations.McGarry v. Scott, 2003-NMSC-016, 134 N.M. 32, 72 P.3d 608.\n\nThe specific requirement under Section 47-5-4 NMSA 1978 of disclosure to a buyer regarding whether the county has accepted subdivision roads for maintenance confirms that the legislature intended county acceptance of roads for maintenance to be a prerequisite to a county obligation to maintain the subdivision roads.McGarry v. Scott, 2003-NMSC-016, 134 N.M. 32, 72 P.3d 608.\n\nSpecificity of road and road maintenance provisions.— The Subdivision Act deals with the subject of subdivision roads and county road maintenance in a much more detailed way than Sections 67-2-1 and 67-2-2 NMSA 1978; therefore, the Subdivision Act controls over the more general statutes.McGarry v.

The owners of parcels on the vacated portion of the final plat may enclose in equal proportions the adjoining streets and alleys that are authorized to be abandoned.\n\nC. The approved statement declaring the vacation of a portion or all of a final plat shall be filed in the office of the county clerk in which the final plat is filed.

      "heading": "Subdivision regulation; county authority.",
      "text": "A. The board of county commissioners of each county shall regulate subdivisions within the county's boundaries. In regulating subdivisions, the board of county commissioners of each county shall adopt regulations setting forth the county's requirements for:\n\n(1) preliminary and final subdivision plats, including their content and format;\n\n(2) quantifying the maximum annual water requirements of subdivisions, including water for indoor and outdoor domestic uses;\n\n(3) assessing water availability to meet the maximum annual water requirements of subdivisions;\n\n(4) water conservation measures;\n\n(5) water of an acceptable quality for human consumption and for protecting the water supply from contamination;\n\n(6) liquid waste disposal;\n\n(7) solid waste disposal;\n\n(8) legal access to each parcel;\n\n(9) sufficient and adequate roads to each parcel, including ingress and egress for emergency vehicles;\n\n(10) utility easements to each parcel;\n\n(11) terrain management;\n\n(12) phased development;\n\n(13) protecting cultural properties, archaeological sites and unmarked burials, as required by the Cultural Properties Act [18-6-1 to 18-6-17 NMSA 1978];\n\n(14) specific information to be contained in a subdivider's disclosure statement in addition to that required in Section 47-6-17 NMSA 1978;\n\n(15) reasonable fees approximating the cost to the county of determining compliance with the New Mexico Subdivision Act and county subdivision regulations while passing upon subdivision plats;\n\n(16) a summary procedure for reviewing certain type-three and all type-five subdivisions as provided in Section 47-6-11 NMSA 1978;\n\n(17) recording all conveyances of parcels with the county clerk;\n\n(18) financial security to assure the completion of all improvements that the subdivider proposes to build or to maintain;\n\n(19) fencing subdivided land, where appropriate, in conformity with Section 77-16-1 NMSA 1978, which places the duty on the purchaser, lessee or other person acquiring an interest in the subdivided land to fence out livestock; and\n\n(20) any other matter relating to subdivisions that the board of county commissioners feels is necessary to promote health, safety or the general welfare.\n\nB. Subsection A of this section does not preempt the authority of any state agency to regulate or perform any activity that it is required or authorized by law to perform.\n\nC. Nothing in the New Mexico Subdivision Act shall be construed to limit the authority of counties to adopt subdivision regulations with requirements that are more stringent than the requirements set forth in the New Mexico Subdivision Act, provided that:\n\n(1) the county has adopted a comprehensive plan in accordance with Section 3-21-5 NMSA 1978;\n\n(2) the comprehensive plan contains goals, objectives and policies that identify and explain the need for requirements that are more stringent; and\n\n(3) the more stringent regulations are specifically identified in the comprehensive plan.\n\nD. The board of county commissioners of a class A county with a population according to the most recent federal decennial census of greater than three hundred thousand may delegate the authority to review and approve preliminary plats and final plats to a county administrative officer or to the planning commission; provided that the delegation complies with the public hearing requirements contained in Section 47-6-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 70-5-9, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 348, § 9; 1981, ch. 148, § 3; 1995, ch. 212, § 9; 2003, ch. 322, § 1; 2005, ch. 139, § 2.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added Subsection D to provide that the board of county commissioners of a class A county with a population greater that three hundred thousand may delegate authority to review and approve plats to an administrative officer or to the planning commission.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective June 20, 2003, deleted former Subsections C and D, concerning when counties shall adopt regulations pursuant to the section, and redesignated former Subsection E as present Subsection C; rewrote present Subsection C to create present Subsection C and Paragraph C(1) and added Paragraphs C(2) and C(3).\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1996, rewrote the section to such an extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nFormerly, board without power to regulate development.— Prior to enactment of the New Mexico Subdivision Act, the power to adopt, promulgate and enforce subdivision regulations had not been delegated to the board of county commissioners, and regulations which purported to empower it to order a phased development were utterly void.El Dorado at Santa Fe, Inc. v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1976-NMSC-029, 89 N.M. 313, 551 P.2d 1360.\n\nStandards may be broad.— Standards adopted pursuant to the New Mexico Subdivision Act may be broad, general standards, so long as they are capable of reasonable application and are sufficient to limit and define the board's discretionary powers.Parker v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1979-NMSC-101, 93 N.M. 641, 603 P.2d 1098.\n\nEffect of noncompliance with plat approval prerequisites.— Where the subdivider fails to meet the conditions he agreed to accomplish and which were required by the county as a prerequisite to plat approval, suspension or revocation of plat approval remain realities for the developer until the subdivider complies with the reasonable conditions imposed by the county within its authority.Parker v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1979-NMSC-101, 93 N.M. 641, 603 P.2d 1098.\n\nWhen resubdivision must comply with current subdivision standards.— The later resubdivision or alteration of or amendment to pre-1973 subdivisions must comply with the new, current subdivision standards if such resubdivision activity substantially affects the new regulated areas of concern which are addressed by the new 1973 New Mexico Subdivision Act (i.e., sufficiency of water, quality of water, roads, etc.). 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-11.\n\nIf proposed alterations to a pre-1973 subdivision involve a wholesale vacating of an entire platted area and subsequent transfer of those vacated lots into a previously unplatted area, such resubdivision efforts rise to the level of an entirely new subdivision which would require the subdivider to apply for subdivision approval under the 1973 New Mexico Subdivision Act as a \"new\" subdivision. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-11.\n\nDuties of county commission relating to plat amendments.— If the county commission determines that amendments to a pre-1973 plat are merely minor adjustments of boundaries, the amendments fall within the scope of the 47-6-2 I(7) NMSA 1978 exemption from the 1973 definition of \"subdivision\" and no reevaluation under the 1973 New Mexico Subdivision Act is triggered. If the commission concludes, on the other hand, that the plat amendments constitute a major revision of the original subdivision, the 1973 standards apply. In either event, the county commission must examine the proposed amendments to the old plats to make such a determination. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-11.\n\nSelective compliance with current regulations permitted.— The county commission may require compliance, on a selective basis, with only those current subdivision regulations and minimum standards that are, or may be, actually affected by a proposed resubdivision. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-11.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Gabaldon v. Sanchez: New Developments in the Law of Nuisance, Negligence and Trespass,\" see 9 N.M.L.

Prior to adopting, amending or repealing any regulation, the board of county commissioners shall consult with representatives of the office of the state engineer, the department of environment, the cultural affairs department, all soil and water conservation districts within the county, the department of transportation and the attorney general about the subjects within their respective expertise for which the board of county commissioners is considering promulgating a regulation. In the process of the consultation, the representatives of each of the state agencies shall give consideration to the conditions peculiar to the county and shall submit written guidelines to the board of county commissioners for its consideration in formulating regulations. The guidelines:\n\n(1) shall be given consideration by the board of county commissioners in the formulation of the county's subdivision regulations;\n\n(2) shall become a part of the record of any hearing in which regulations are adopted, amended or repealed; and\n\n(3) may be in such detail as the agency involved desires.\n\nB. A regulation may not be adopted, amended or repealed until after a public hearing held by the board of county commissioners. Notice of the hearing shall be given at least thirty days prior to the hearing date and shall state:\n\n(1) the subject of the regulation;\n\n(2) the time and place of the hearing;\n\n(3) the manner in which interested persons may present their views; and\n\n(4) the place and manner in which interested persons may secure copies of any proposed regulation.

The notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.\n\nD. Reasonable effort shall be made to give notice to all persons who have made a written request to the board of county commissioners for advance notice of its hearings.\n\nE. The board of county commissioners shall give the state engineer, the department of environment, the cultural affairs department, the department of transportation, all soil and water conservation districts within the county and the attorney general thirty days' notice of its regulation hearings.\n\nF. At the hearing, the board of county commissioners shall allow all interested persons reasonable opportunity to submit data, views or arguments, orally or in writing, and to examine witnesses testifying at the hearing.

Representatives from the office of the state engineer, the department of environment, the cultural affairs department, all soil and water conservation districts within the county, the department of transportation and the attorney general shall be given the opportunity to make an oral statement at the hearing and to enter into the record of the hearing a written statement setting forth any comments that they may have about the proposed regulation, whether favorable or unfavorable, when the proposed regulation relates to an issue that is within the agencies' respective areas of expertise.\n\nH. A regulation is not invalid because of the failure of a state agency to submit a guideline prior to the promulgation of the regulation or because the representative of a state agency did not appear at a public hearing on the regulation or did not make any comment for entry in the hearing record.\n\nI. The board of county commissioners shall act on the proposed regulations at the regulation hearings or at a public meeting to be held within thirty days of the hearing on the proposed regulations. Upon adopting, amending or repealing the regulations, the board of county commissioners shall include in the record a short statement setting forth the board's reasoning and the basis of the board's decision, including the facts and circumstances considered and the weight given to those facts and circumstances.\n\nJ. Any person heard or represented at the hearing shall be given written notice of the board's decision, including the facts and circumstances considered, if the person makes a written request to the board for notice of its decision.\n\nK. A regulation, amendment or repeal is not effective until thirty days after it is filed with the county clerk.\n\nL. Any person who is or may be adversely affected by a decision of the board of county commissioners to adopt, amend or repeal a regulation may appeal that decision to the district court. All appeals shall be upon the record made at the hearing and shall be filed in the district court within thirty days after the board of county commissioners votes to adopt, amend or repeal the regulation.\n\nM. An appeal is perfected by filing a notice of appeal in the district court of the county that has adopted, amended or repealed the regulation. The appellant shall certify in the notice of appeal that arrangements have been made with the board of county commissioners for preparation of a sufficient number of transcripts of the record of the hearing to support the appeal, including one copy that the appellant shall furnish at the appellant's own expense to the board of county commissioners. A copy of the notice of appeal shall also be served upon the board of county commissioners.\n\nN.

Preliminary plats shall be submitted for type-one, type-two, type-three, except type-three subdivisions that are subject to review under summary procedure as set forth in Subsection I of this section, and type-four subdivisions.\n\nB. Prior to approving the preliminary plat, the board of county commissioners of the county in which the subdivision is located shall require that the subdivider furnish documentation of:\n\n(1) water sufficient in quantity to fulfill the maximum annual water requirements of the subdivision, including water for indoor and outdoor domestic uses;\n\n(2) water of an acceptable quality for human consumption and measures to protect the water supply from contamination;\n\n(3) the means of liquid waste disposal for the subdivision;\n\n(4) the means of solid waste disposal for the subdivision;\n\n(5) satisfactory roads to each parcel, including ingress and egress for emergency vehicles, and utility easements to each parcel;\n\n(6) terrain management to protect against flooding, inadequate drainage and erosion; and\n\n(7) protections for cultural properties, archaeological sites and unmarked burials that may be affected directly by the subdivision, as required by the Cultural Properties Act [18-6-1 to 18-6-17 NMSA 1978].\n\nC.

If, in the opinion of each appropriate public agency or an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo, a subdivider can fulfill the requirements of Subsection F of this section, the board of county commissioners shall weigh these opinions in determining whether to approve the preliminary plat at a public hearing to be held in accordance with Section 47-6-14 NMSA 1978.\n\nH. If, in the opinion of the appropriate public agency or an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo, a subdivider cannot fulfill the requirements of Subsection F of this section or, if the appropriate public agency or the Indian nation, tribe or pueblo does not have sufficient information upon which to base an opinion on any one of these subjects, the subdivider shall be notified of this fact by the board of county commissioners, and the procedure set out below shall be followed:\n\n(1) if the appropriate public agency or the Indian nation, tribe or pueblo has rendered an adverse opinion, the board of county commissioners shall give the subdivider a copy of the opinion;\n\n(2) the subdivider shall be given thirty days from the date of notification to submit additional information to the public agency or the Indian nation, tribe or pueblo through the board of county commissioners; and\n\n(3) the public agency or the Indian nation, tribe or pueblo shall have thirty days from the date the subdivider submits additional information to change its opinion or issue a favorable opinion when it has withheld one because of insufficient information. No more than thirty days following the date of the expiration of the thirty-day period, during which the public agency or the Indian nation, tribe or pueblo reviews any additional information submitted by the subdivider, the board of county commissioners shall hold a public hearing in accordance with Section 47-6-14 NMSA 1978 to determine whether to approve the preliminary plat. Where the public agency has rendered an adverse opinion, the subdivider has the burden of showing that the adverse opinion is incorrect either as to factual or legal matters. Where the Indian nation, tribe or pueblo has rendered an adverse opinion, the subdivider may submit additional information to the board of county commissioners. If a public agency disagrees with an adverse opinion rendered by an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo, that agency shall submit a response to the board of county commissioners.\n\nI.

Any subdivider submitting a plat of a type-five subdivision shall submit sufficient information to the board of county commissioners to permit the board to determine whether the subdivider can fulfill the requirements of Subsection J of this section.\n\nM. The board of county commissioners shall by regulation establish a procedure for summary review for certain type-three subdivisions, as provided in Subsection I of this section, and all type-five subdivisions. If the board of county commissioners fails to adopt criteria for summary review, the board of county commissioners shall approve the plat if it complies with Sections 47-6-3 and 47-6-4 NMSA 1978 within the time limitation set forth in Section 47-6-22 NMSA 1978. The board of county commissioners may delegate to any county administrative officer or planning commission member the authority to approve any subdivision under summary review. Approval by summary review is conclusive evidence of the approval of the board of county commissioners.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 70-5-11, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 348, § 11; 1977, ch. 253, § 72; 1995, ch. 212, § 11; 2009, ch. 65, § 2.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective June 19, 2009, added Paragraph (5) of Subsection F; and in Subsections G and H, added \"or an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo\".\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective July 1, 1996, rewrote the section to such an extent that a detailed comparison would be impracticable.\n\nStandards may be broad.— Standards adopted pursuant to the New Mexico Subdivision Act may be broad, general standards, so long as they are capable of reasonable application and are sufficient to limit and define the board's discretionary powers.Parker v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1979-NMSC-101, 93 N.M. 641, 603 P.2d 1098.\n\nConstitutionality of retroactive application of zoning ordinances.— The retroactive application of a new zoning ordinance to an administrative action in which the plaintiff only submitted an application for preliminary plat approval of its subdivision did not violate N.M. Const., art. IV, § 34 because plaintiff did not establish a \"vested right\" under the vested rights approach. There are two prongs which must be met for a vested right to exist. First, there must be approval by the regulatory body, and second, there must be a substantial change in position in reliance thereon.Brazos Land, Inc. v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1993-NMCA-013, 115 N.M. 168, 848 P.2d 1095.\n\nFinal decision rests with county.— The final decision whether or not to approve a proposal to construct a subdivision clearly rests with county governments, and county governments may apply their own discretion in weighing state agency opinions along with other evidence when making that decision consistent with the requirements of both county regulations and the Subdivision Act (Chapter 47, Article 6 NMSA 1978).C.F.T. Dev., LLC v. Board. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 2001-NMCA-069, 130 N.M. 775, 32 P.3d 784.\n\nCounty determines \"sufficient information\".— Because the Subsection B (now Subsection E) requirement of submission of \"sufficient information\" is general, the county is left to determine what quantum of information amounts to \"sufficient information\" and to specify the form for acquiring it.Parker v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 1979-NMSC-101, 93 N.M. 641, 603 P.2d 1098.\n\nClaim for relief not provided.— The legislature did not provide that a landowner owning adjoining land to a subdivider have a claim for relief against a subdivider for violating Subsection A(6) (now B(6)).Gabaldon v. Sanchez, 1978-NMCA-103, 92 N.M. 224, 585 P.2d 1105.\n\nWhen resubdivision must comply with current subdivision standards.— The later resubdivision or alteration of or amendment to pre-1973 subdivisions must comply with the new, current subdivision standards if such resubdivision activity substantially affects the new regulated areas of concern which are addressed by the new 1973 New Mexico Subdivision Act (i.e., sufficiency of water, quality of water, roads, etc.). 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-11.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Gabaldon v. Sanchez: New Developments in the Law of Nuisance, Negligence and Trespass,\" see 9 N.M.L.
