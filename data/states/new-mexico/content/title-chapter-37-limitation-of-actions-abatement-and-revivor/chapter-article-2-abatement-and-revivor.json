      "heading": "What causes of action survive.Section 37-2-2 - [Transfer pendente lite; no abatement",
      "text": "In addition to the causes of action which survive at common law, causes of action for mesne profits, or for an injury to real or personal estate, or for any deceit or fraud, shall also survive, and the action may be brought, notwithstanding the death of the person entitled or liable to the same. The cause of action for wrongful death and the cause of action for personal injuries, shall survive the death of the party responsible therefor.\n\nHistory:Laws 1884, ch. 5, § 1; C.L. 1884, § 2138; C.L. 1897, § 3087; Code 1915, § 4264; C.S. 1929, § 105-1202; Laws 1941, ch. 79, § 1; 1941 Comp., § 19-701; 1953 Comp., § 21-7-1.\n\nCross references.— For death of party to pending action,see37-2-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor survival and revivor of suit, action or proceeding by or against head of agency or other state officer despite executive reorganization,see9-1-10 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor nonabatement of partition suit on death of tenant,see42-5-9 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor rule concerning substitution of parties,seeRule 1-025 NMRA.\n\nLegislative intent.— Language of this section indicates that the legislature intended the specified causes of action to survive but had no intent concerning nonsurvival of actions under the common-law rule.Rodgers v. Ferguson, 1976-NMCA-098, 89 N.M. 688, 556 P.2d 844, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619.\n\nAlteration of common law.— While legislative intent was that survival of causes of action not specified in this section depend on the common law, there is no indication of a legislative intent to preserve the ancient common-law rule which existed when the statute was enacted; therefore, the court of appeals could adopt a \"new\" common-law rule allowing an action to recover damages for personal injuries between accident and victim's unrelated death to survive that death.Rodgers v. Ferguson, 1976-NMCA-098, 89 N.M. 688, 556 P.2d 844, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619.\n\nWill contest.— An action to contest a will for undue influence by heirs at law of testatrix will survive, although they claimed interest in the estate through their father, and the father died after probate of the will.In re Morrow's Will, 1937-NMSC-090, 41 N.M. 723, 73 P.2d 1360.\n\nInjuries to reputation or privacy.— Libel, slander, defamation and, more recently, invasion of privacy did not survive the death of the injured party at common law, and because they are not mentioned in this section, they do not survive hereunder.Gruschus v. Curtis Publishing Co., 342 F.2d 775 (10th Cir. 1965).\n\nSurvival of wrongful death suit formerly.— Prior to the 1941 amendment to this section, cause of action for death, asserted against defendant as personal representative of alleged wrongdoer, a common carrier, did not survive the latter's death irrespective of the statute creating right of action against the carrier, by reason of this survival statute.Ickes v. Brimhall, 1938-NMSC-036, 42 N.M. 412, 79 P.2d 942.\n\nAccrual of cause before death.— Even though cause of action accrues but very short time before death of the wrongdoer, survival results.Cash v. Addington, 1942-NMSC-058, 46 N.M. 451, 131 P.2d 265.\n\nFinding that wrongdoer was \"instantly killed\" in an automobile collision in which plaintiff was injured does not connote that his death occurred before injury of the plaintiff and evidence was sufficient in particular case to permit supreme court to determine that the decedent lived long enough for cause of action to accrue.Cash v. Addington, 1942-NMSC-058, 46 N.M. 451, 131 P.2d 265.\n\nEffect of order of death.— Under this section, the order of death (e.g., in the case of a husband whose death may have been preceded by that of his wife) is not an element of the plaintiff's case. It is sufficient if the husband's death was occasioned by his wife's otherwise actionable act or neglect occurring while she was still living, even if her death precedes his.Corlett v. Smith, 1988-NMCA-067, 107 N.M. 707, 763 P.2d 1172, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 610, 762 P.2d 897.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 1 Am.

      "text": "Upon the death of a defendant in an action, wherein the right of any part thereof survives against his personal representatives, the revivor shall be against him, and it may also be against the heirs or devisees of the defendant, or both, when the right of action or any part thereof survives against them.\n\nHistory:Laws 1884, ch. 5, § 11; C.L. 1884, § 2148; C.L. 1897, § 3097; Code 1915, § 4274; C.S. 1929, § 105-1212; 1941 Comp., § 19-711; 1953 Comp., § 21-7-11.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For limitation on revivor against representative or successor of a defendant, absent consent,see37-2-13 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor substitution of parties upon the occurrence of various contingencies, including death of a party,seeRule 1-025 NMRA.\n\nRevival of actions at law is purely statutory,and they may be revived only as prescribed by this section.A.J. Armstrong Co. v. Hufstedler, 1965-NMSC-091, 75 N.M. 408, 405 P.2d 411.\n\nAgainst whom revivor may be had.— This section does not permit a revivor against either the personal representative or the heirs or devisees, at the plaintiff's election and without regard to the nature of the action; revivor may only be against the person against whom the right of action involved in the litigation survives.A.J. Armstrong Co. v. Hufstedler, 1965-NMSC-091, 75 N.M. 408, 405 P.2d 411.\n\n\"Personal representative\".— The personal representative of a decedent's estate, within the meaning of the survival statute, is his executor or administrator.A.J. Armstrong Co. v. Hufstedler, 1965-NMSC-091, 75 N.M. 408, 405 P.2d 411.\n\nRevivor against personal representative essential.— A pending action cannot be prosecuted after the death of a party defendant, so as to affect his estate, until it is revived against his personal representative or successor in interest.A.J. Armstrong Co. v. Hufstedler, 1965-NMSC-091, 75 N.M. 408, 405 P.2d 411.\n\nWhere the action brought against decedent prior to his death was on account of an alleged breach of an agreement to execute a note, and unquestionably affected his personal estate, since it would require payment by the personal representative in the event of a money judgment, the action could only continue after his death against his estate, and revivor would have to be against his personal representative, an indispensable party.A.J. Armstrong Co. v. Hufstedler, 1965-NMSC-091, 75 N.M. 408, 405 P.2d 411.\n\nFailure to revive against personal representative.— Judgment in plaintiff's favor following substitution by court order of widow of defendant, who had died pendente lite, as his heir and \"personal representative,\" where in fact no personal representative had been appointed for the estate, would be dismissed for failure to revive against decedent's personal representative.A.J. Armstrong Co. v. Hufstedler, 1965-NMSC-091, 75 N.M. 408, 405 P.2d 411.\n\nClaim against estate unnecessary.— The revival of a suit pending against a decedent at the time of his death, within the time for filing claims against the estate, dispenses with filing the claim against the estate.Romero v. Hopewell, 1922-NMSC-037, 28 N.M. 259, 210 P. 231.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 1 Am. Jur. 2d Abatement, Survival and Revival § 120.\n\n1 C.J.S. Abatement and Revival § 164.",
