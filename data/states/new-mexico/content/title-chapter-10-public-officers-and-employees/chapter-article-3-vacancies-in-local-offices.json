Chapman v. Truder, 1930-NMSC-049, 35 N.M. 49, 289 P. 594.\n\nEffect on other section.— This section, creating a vacancy for \"failure of the officer to qualify as provided by law\" does not repeal by implication the last line of 10-3-3 NMSA 1978 providing that an appointive officer shall hold office until \"his successor shall be duly elected and qualified according to law.\"State ex rel. Rives v. Herring, 1953-NMSC-086, 57 N.M. 600, 261 P.2d 442.\n\nEffect where authority to hold over after expiration of term.— During the period in which a public officer holds over after the expiration of his term, under constitutional or statutory authority entitling him to do so until the election and qualification of a successor, there is no vacancy in office which may be filled by an interim appointment.State ex rel. Rives v. Herring, 1953-NMSC-086, 57 N.M. 600, 261 P.2d 442.\n\nReelected county clerk's resignation before new term.— Where a reelected county clerk resigned prior to the beginning of her new term, a vacancy in office was thereby created pursuant to this section and the person properly appointed on the same day as the resignation and qualified pursuant to Section 10-3-3 NMSA 1978 was entitled to hold the office until her successor was duly elected and qualified; therefore, there was no vacancy in the office for the new term.State ex rel. Rives v. Herring, 1953-NMSC-086, 57 N.M. 600, 261 P.2d 442.\n\nEffect of death of elected candidate before term begins.— The death of an elected candidate before term of office commences does not seat the minority candidate, but creates a vacancy to be filled as in case of vacancy for any other reason. 1918 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 18-2145.\n\nMeaning of \"qualify\".— The word \"qualify\" does not refer to eligibility for the office but rather to the performance of the acts which the chosen person is required to perform before he can enter into office (usually the taking of an oath and the filing of a bond). 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-86.\n\nResidence in legal contemplation.— Residence in legal contemplation may be maintained in a locality despite actual physical absence, the mental intent of the person being an important factor in determining residence. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-20.\n\nIntracounty move of county commissioner.— The removal of a county commissioner from the district from which he was elected to another part of the county does not create a vacancy in the office. 1912 Op.

      "text": "Whenever any vacancy in any county office in any of the counties of this state, other than a vacancy in the office of county commissioner, occurs by reason of death, resignation or otherwise, it is the duty of the board of county commissioners of the county where such vacancy has occurred to fill the vacancy by appointment, and the appointee shall be entitled to hold the office until the end of the unexpired term of office.\n\nHistory:Laws 1907, ch. 6, § 2; Code 1915, § 1219; C.S. 1929, § 33-4233; 1941 Comp., § 10-302; 1953 Comp., § 5-3-2; 2019, ch. 212, § 212.\n\nCross references.— For appointment of successor,see10-4-28 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor tenure of office of state officers,seeN.M.

Having made the appointment which filled the vacancy, the jurisdiction of the board was exhausted until another vacancy occurred. It is irrelevant that the plaintiff was designated as \"acting county clerk\" or that she filed her oath of office and bond as an \"acting county clerk\"; the appointment is for the full legal term, notwithstanding the appointing body's attempt to give it a different duration.State ex rel. Walker v. Dilley, 1974-NMSC-090, 86 N.M. 796, 528 P.2d 209.\n\nSerial appointments.— Where power has been given to appoint to an office and the same has been exercised, any subsequent appointment to the same office will be void unless the prior incumbent has been removed or the office has otherwise become vacant, and an office is not vacant so long as it is supplied, in the manner provided by the constitution or law, with an incumbent who is legally qualified to exercise the power and perform the duties which pertain to it.State ex rel. Walker v. Dilley, 1974-NMSC-090, 86 N.M. 796, 528 P.2d 209.\n\nEffect of hold-over authority after term expiration.— During the period in which a public officer holds over after the expiration of his term, under constitutional or statutory authority entitling him to do so until the election and qualification of a successor, there is no vacancy in office which may be filled by an interim appointment.State ex rel. Rives v. Herring, 1953-NMSC-086, 57 N.M. 600, 261 P.2d 442.\n\nAppointee incumbent cannot be displaced by another appointee.State ex rel. Rives v. Herring, 1953-NMSC-086, 57 N.M. 600, 261 P.2d 442.\n\nReelected clerk's resignation prior to beginning of term.— Where a reelected county clerk resigned prior to the beginning of her new term, a vacancy in office was thereby created pursuant to Section 10-3-1 NMSA 1978 and the person properly appointed on the same day as the resignation was entitled to hold the office until her successor was duly elected and qualified; therefore, there was no vacancy in the office for the new term.State ex rel. Rives v. Herring, 1953-NMSC-086, 57 N.M. 600, 261 P.2d 442.\n\nLast line of section not repealed.— Section 10-3-1 NMSA 1978, creating a vacancy for \"failure of the officer to qualify as provided by law\" does not repeal by implication the last line of this section, providing that an appointive officer shall hold office until \"his successor shall be duly elected and qualified according to law.\"State ex rel. Rives v. Herring, 1953-NMSC-086, 57 N.M. 600, 261 P.2d 442.\n\nNo power to appoint when no power to elect.— Where people had no legal right to elect an assessor for a county, board of county commissioners had no legal right to appoint, and where such appointment was made, there being no vacancy, such appointment was of no legal effect.Territory ex rel. Sandoval v. Albright, 1904-NMSC-021, 12 N.M. 293, 78 P. 204,appeal dismissed, 200 U.S. 9, 26 S. Ct. 210, 50 L. Ed. 346 (1906).\n\nProbate judge vacancy appointments.— A probate judge, who is appointed to replace a probate judge who died in the first year of a four-year term, must participate in the first primary and general elections after the appointment and if elected, the appointee must run again two years later when the original term expires. 2012 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 12-04.\n\nIncumbent ineligible for reappointment.— A vacancy in a county office may occur where a successor in an office fails to qualify. The board of county commissioners must appoint a person to fill the vacancy and an incumbent who has already served two consecutive terms is ineligible for that appointment. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-19.\n\nAppointment within a reasonable time.— No mention is made of the time in which the appointment must be made, thus, in the absence of any directives, the appointment must be made within a reasonable time. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-50.\n\nIncumbent may hold over.— Where person elected to office of probate judge dies before taking office, and incumbent of the office is appointed by county commissioners a year before that time upon resignation of the probate judge, the incumbent holds over until a successor is appointed by board of county commissioners. 1936 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 36-1480.\n\nDuration of appointee's term.— A county officer appointed by the board of county commissioners serves until the next succeeding general election. 1924 Op. Att'y Gen.

Att'y Gen. No. 14-1236.\n\nScope of powers.— The board of county commissioners has the power to fill vacancies in any county offices, except vacancies occurring in the board itself. 1912 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 12-944.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —20 C.J.S. Counties § 103.",
