Money deposited in the surety bond fund may be expended by the department:\n\n(1) to provide surety bond coverage;\n\n(2) to create a retention fund to cover all or any portion of the surety bond risks of state agencies and covered educational entities;\n\n(3) to pay claims of state agencies and covered educational entities covered by a surety bond certificate of coverage issued by the department; and\n\n(4) to pay any costs and expenses of carrying out the provisions of this section.\n\nC. Claims against the surety bond fund shall be made in accordance with a certificate of coverage issued by the department to each state agency and covered educational entity. If the secretary has reason to believe that the surety bond fund would be exhausted by the payment of all claims allowed against the fund during a particular state fiscal year, the amounts paid for each claim shall be prorated with each state agency and covered educational entity receiving an amount equal to the percentage that its claims bear to the total of claims outstanding and payable from the fund. Any amounts due and unpaid as a result of such proration shall be paid in the following fiscal years.\n\nD. The department shall collect or transfer funds from each state agency and covered educational entity to cover costs of coverage of employees of the agency as required by this section. Money collected or transferred from a state agency or covered educational entity pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the surety bond fund. Income from the surety bond fund shall be credited to the fund.\n\nE.
