      "text": "In order to extend to employees of the state and its political subdivisions and to the dependents and survivors of such employees, the basic protection accorded to others by the old-age and survivors' insurance system embodied in the Social Security Act, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the legislature, subject to the limitations of this act [10-14-1 to 10-14-3, 10-14-5 to 10-14-10 NMSA 1978], that such steps be taken as to provide such protection to employees of the state and its political subdivisions on as board [broad] a basis as is permitted under the Social Security Act. It is also the policy of the legislature that the protection afforded employees in positions covered by a retirement system on the date an agreement under this act is made applicable to service performed in such positions, or receiving periodic benefits under such retirement system at such time, will not be impaired as a result of making the agreement so applicable or as a result of legislative enactment in anticipation thereof.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-7-1, enacted by Laws 1955, ch. 172, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For the federal Social Security Act,see42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.\n\nLegislative effect.— What in effect the legislature did by the passage of Laws 1955, ch. 172, was make an offer to all state employees covered by state retirement system that if they elected to come within the provisions of social security, the state would provide for the share required by the Social Security Act from the employer. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-61.\n\nEffect of section on school for visually handicapped.— The New Mexico school for the visually handicapped is not legally separate and distinct; it is in fact a state educational institution. Most of its funds come from either state school lands or from appropriations from the legislature. This institution is actually a part of the state. Inasmuch as the school for the visually handicapped is not a political subdivision, it cannot be considered a separate retirement system for the purposes of holding a referendum relative to the coverage under the old-age and survivors insurance program. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6411.\n\nEligibility.— Under the social security laws, both state and federal, all members of the retirement system become eligible for social security upon a favorable vote of the referendum posing the questions of joining the social security system. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6416.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —81 C.J.S. Social Security and Public Welfare §§ 28, 32 et seq.",

Service which under the Social Security Act may be included in an agreement only upon certification by the governor or an officer of the state designated by the governor, in accordance with Section 218(d)(3) of that act shall be included in the term \"employment\" if and when the governor, or an officer of the state designated by the governor, issues, with respect to such service, a certificate to the secretary of health, education and welfare pursuant to Section 9(b) [10-14-10B NMSA 1978] of this act, provided, however, that an agreement may exclude (1) any service of an emergency nature; (2) services performed in the employ of a school, college or university by a student who is enrolled and regularly attending classes at such school, college or university; (3) all services in any class or classes of (a) elective positions; (b) part-time positions, or (c) positions the compensation for which is on a fee basis, performed by an employee of the state or an employee of a subdivision of the state, if so provided in a plan submitted by said subdivision under Section 5 [10-14-6 NMSA 1978] of this act;\n\nC. the term \"employee\" includes an officer of a state or political subdivision thereof;\n\nD. the term \"state agency\" means the agency of the state of New Mexico designated by the governor for the administration of this act;\n\nE. the term \"secretary of health, education and welfare\" includes any individual to whom the secretary of health, education and welfare has delegated any functions under the Social Security Act with respect to coverage under such act of employees of states and their political subdivisions, and with respect to any action taken prior to April 11, 1953, includes the federal security administrator and any individual to whom such administrator had delegated any such function;\n\nF. the term \"political subdivision\" includes an instrumentality of the state or one or more of its political subdivisions, or of the state and one or more of its political subdivisions, but only if such instrumentality is a juristic entity which is legally separate and distinct from the state or subdivision and only if its employees are not by virtue of their relation to such juristic entity employees of the state or subdivision;\n\nG. the term \"Social Security Act\" means the act of congress approved August 14, 1935, Chapter 531, 49 Stat. 620, officially cited as the \"Social Security Act,\" (including regulations and requirements issued pursuant thereto), as such act has been and may from time to time be amended; and\n\nH. the term \"Federal Insurance Contributions Act\" means Subchapter A of Chapter 9 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and Subchapters A and B of Chapter 21 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as such codes have been and may from time to time be amended; and the term \"employee tax\" means the tax imposed by Section 1400 of such code of 1939 and Section 3101 of such code of 1954, as it has been and may from time to time be amended.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-7-2, enacted by Laws 1955, ch. 172, § 2; 1973, ch. 329, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Section 1400 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, referred to in Subsection H, has been repealed and superseded by § 3101 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, also referred to in Subsection H, compiled as 26 U.S.C. § 3101.\n\nCross references.— For the Federal Insurance Contributions Act,see26 U.S.C. §§ 3101 to 3128.\n\nFor the federal Social Security Act,see42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq. For Section 218(d)(3) of the act,see42 U.S.C. § 418(d)(3).\n\nEffect of section on sick leave payments.— Where the university of New Mexico did not make a social security contribution with respect to sick leave payments on the grounds that such payments were excluded from wages, the social security administration was justified in assessing $28.60 in respect to those payments and holding that they were not excluded from wages.New Mexico v. Weinberger, 517 F.2d 989 (10th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1051, 96 S. Ct. 779, 46 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1976).\n\nExclusion construed differently.— In assessing contributions to be paid in by private employers the commissioner of internal revenue has construed the sick pay exclusion from wages differently than has the secretary of health, education and welfare in assessing public employers.N.M. v. Weinberger, 517 F.2d 989 (10th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1051, 96 S. Ct. 779, 46 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1976).\n\nSick leave payments are wages.— Payments made to employees of the University of New Mexico during period of sickness are considered wages and therefore reportable for social security purposes. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-21.\n\nHospitals not political subdivisions.— Hospitals created jointly by counties and municipalities are not independent political subdivisions, but are an intricate part of the county and the municipality creating the same, and therefore they can come under the social security system only as the county and the municipality of which they are part come within the provisions of the Social Security Act. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6437.\n\nMayordomo officer of political subdivision.— The mayordomo of a community ditch association is considered an officer of a political subdivision of the state for social security coverage purposes. 1970 Op.

The governor is empowered to authorize a referendum, and to designate any agency or individual to supervise its conduct, in accordance with the requirements of Section 218(d)(3) of the Social Security Act, on the question of whether service in positions covered by a retirement system established by the state or by a political subdivision thereof should be excluded from or included under an agreement under this act [10-14-1 to 10-14-3, 10-14-5 to 10-14-10 NMSA 1978]. The notice of referendum required by Section 218(d)(3)(C) of the Social Security Act to be given to employees shall contain or shall be accompanied by a statement, in such form and such detail as the agency or individual designated to supervise the referendum shall deem necessary and sufficient, to inform the employees of the rights which will accrue to them and their dependents and survivors, and the liabilities to which they will be subject, if their services are included under an agreement under this act.\n\nB. Upon receiving evidence satisfactory to him that with respect to any such referendum the conditions specified in Section 218(d)(3) of the Social Security Act have been met, the governor or an officer of the state designated by the governor, shall so certify to the secretary of health, education and welfare.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-7-9, enacted by Laws 1955, ch. 172, § 9; 1973, ch. 329, § 4.\n\nCross references.— For Section 218 of the federal Social Security Act,see42 U.S.C. § 418.\n\nLegislative intent.— The legislature intends, so far as the political subdivisions are concerned, that the initial step for coverage is to be made by the political subdivision by submitting a plan. If the plan is proper, and the political subdivision has its own retirement system or was a part of the state system, the governor is to call for a referendum for such political subdivision. If there happens to be a number of such divisions with proper plans, they can, of course, be grouped together for the purpose of the referendum. No political subdivision would work out a plan for coverage without first determining that the employees were for such plan. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6333.\n\nScope of gubernatorial powers as to referendums.— The governor can, within the provisions of the Social Security Act, designate what shall constitute a retirement system for the purpose of a referendum. The governor can designate each political subdivision as a separate retirement system for the purpose of this referendum. 1955 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 55-6333.\n\nAm.
