To determine whether a state statute denies a home rule municipality certain authority, it must first be determined whether the statute is a general law, that is, whether the law applies generally throughout the state and is of statewide concern as contrasted to local or municipal law, and then it must be determined whether the provision expressly denies a home rule municipality the authority to prohibit its employees from seeking elective office.Kane v. City of Albuquerque, 2015-NMSC-027.\n\nWhere the city of Albuquerque's charter and personnel rules prohibit employees of the city from being a candidate for, or from holding elective office of, the state of New Mexico or any of its political subdivisions, petitioner, a city firefighter, claimed that the city charter was not a valid exercise of the city's municipal powers because it was preempted by 10-7F-9 NMSA 1978. The New Mexico supreme court held that 10-7F-9 NMSA 1978 did not preempt the city's charter, because the regulation of government employees' activities under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution touches upon issues of local, not statewide, concern, and therefore this section is not a general law. Moreover, the city's home rule charter falls within this section's \"except as otherwise provided by law\" exception, such that this section does not preempt municipal employment regulations as applied to hazardous duty officers.Kane v. City of Albuquerque, 2015-NMSC-027.",
