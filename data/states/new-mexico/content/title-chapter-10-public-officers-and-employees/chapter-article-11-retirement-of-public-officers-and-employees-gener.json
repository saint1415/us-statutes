      "text": "Chapter 10, Article 11 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Public Employees Retirement Act\".\n\nHistory:Laws 1987, ch. 253, § 1.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1987, Chapter 253 repealed former 10-11-1 NMSA 1978, as amended by Laws 1985 (1st S.S.), ch. 10, § 1, relating to definitions, and enacted the above section, effective July 1, 1987.\n\nCompiler's notes.— Laws 1987, ch. 59 purported to amend this section, but was not published because of the repeal and reenactment by Laws 1987, ch. 253.See12-1-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nRecovery of worker's compensation benefits and benefits under this article.— A worker is not precluded from recovering benefits under both the Public Employees' Retirement Act and the Workers' Compensation Act.Montney v. State ex rel. State Highway Dep't, 1989-NMCA-002, 108 N.M. 326, 772 P.2d 360.\n\nLegislative retirement provisions unconstitutional.— The legislative retirement provisions of the Public Employees' Retirement Act, Chapter 10, Article 11 NMSA 1978, are unconstitutional, invalid and unenforceable: Legislators may receive only per diem and mileage under N.M. Const., art. IV, § 10. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-62.\n\nThe public employee retirement association possesses the legal authority to deduct union dues, and the administrative costs of such deductions, from pension benefits.— The Public Employees Retirement Act (act) does not address whether the public employees retirement association (PERA) may deduct union dues for its beneficiaries that are also union members, but it does appear that the policy purpose behind the act is to ensure that members benefit from a state-backed retirement plan that accounts for membership needs, including remittance or withholding of funds on behalf of its members, and therefore, where a subsection of PERA's beneficiaries sought dues deductions from their respective benefit amounts for union membership, PERA had the legal authority to deduct union dues from pension benefits of PERA members who are also members of unions. Furthermore, if this subsection of beneficiaries consent to absorbing the administrative costs that accompany the deductions and subsequent remittances to the unions, the subject beneficiaries are knowingly and willingly accepting those administrative costs, which would also appear to comply with the act.PERA Deduction of Dues from PERA Retirement Benefits for RPENM and AFSCME Members and Reimbursement of PERA's Administrative Costs for the Dues Deduction(8/25/21), Att'y Gen.

The section provided that an employee could purchase up to five years of credited service \"during the seventy-fifth or seventy-sixth fiscal year,\" subject to various conditions. Not only was the statute ambiguous by referring to both the seventy-fifth and seventy-sixth fiscal years at the same time, it was also internally inconsistent; the cost for an additional year of service credit had already been fixed by Section 3 of the 1986 amendment to this article (Chapter 89), and no one argues that § 139 was intended to change that cost, retroactively, to comport with the formula spelled out later in § 139. Thus, the early retirees in the seventy-sixth fiscal year under Laws 1987, Ch. 253, § 139 were required to pay an equivalent amount to purchase service credits as paid by early retirees under Laws 1986, ch. 89, § 3.State ex rel.

The\"; and added Subsection G.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective July 1, 2009, in Subsection D, deleted the former language which referred to Paragraphs (2) and (3) of Subsection C and added new language; and added Paragraph (3) of Subsection D.\n\nThe 2004 amendment,effective March 4, 2004, amended Subsection A to add \"prior to the selected date of retirement\" at the beginning of the subsection, to delete the same language from Paragraphs (1) and (2), amended Subsection C to insert at the beginning of the subsection \"Except as provided in Subsection D or E of this section\", added Subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Paragraph (1) to provide for contributions by a retired member who earns more than $25,000 in a calendar year in Paragraph (2), added new Subsections D and E and redesignated former Subsection D as Subsection F.\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, deleted former Subsections C, D, E and F, concerning return to employment, inserted present Subsection C and redesignated former Subsection G as present Subsection D.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, in Subsection C, deleted \"or the educational retirement system\" following \"public employer\" in the first sentence, inserted \"the following conditions shall apply\" in the second sentence, designated Paragraph (1), deleted former Paragraph (1), regarding previously retired members subsequently employed by an employer covered under the Educational Retirement Act, and substituted \"Public Employees Retirement Act\" for \"retirement act covering the subsequent employer\" in Paragraph (2); deleted \"on or before July 1, 1992\" at the end of the sentence in Subsection E; and substituted \"provision\" for \"subsection\" in the last sentence of Subsection G.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective July 1, 1992, deleted \"or vested former member\" following \"member\" and substituted \"service credit\" for \"credited service\" several times throughout the section; substituted \"employers covered by any state system or the educational retirement system\" for \"affiliated public employers\" in Subsection A(2); rewrote Subsection C; added Subsection E; redesignated former Subsections E and F as Subsections F and G; in Subsection G, deleted \"from among the two or more coverage plans\" following \"planned\" in the first sentence and rewrote the former second sentence so as to constitute the present second and third sentences; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.\n\nApplicability of elected official exception.— The former wording of the elected official exception clearly indicates that the legislature intended for there to be a difference between a person who \"became\" an elected official, and a person who was serving a successive term. Therefore, the only conclusion is that a person who begins a successive term has not become an elected official. The elected official exception, on its face, applies only to those who became an elected official after they were already an annuitant.Rainaldi v. Public Emps. Ret. Bd., 1993-NMSC-028, 115 N.M. 650, 857 P.2d 761 (decided under former 10-11-9E NMSA 1978).\n\nPurpose of elected official exception.— The elected official exception serves the limited purpose of encouraging people who have accumulated expertise and wisdom in their years of service to run for elected office after retiring from their former positions. The legislature could not have intended to encourage those who have already been serving to simultaneously collect a salary and retirement benefits earned in that position.Rainaldi v. Public Emps. Ret. Bd., 1993-NMSC-028, 115 N.M. 650, 857 P.2d 761.\n\nApplicability of chief of police exemption after 2010 amendment.— Where the city appointed plaintiff as chief of police in September 2006 without specifying the end date of plaintiff's term of office; at the time of the appointment, plaintiff was a PERA retiree and 10-11-8(D) NMSA 1978 contained a chief of police exemption that permitted plaintiff to receive both a pension and a salary; in 2010, 10-11-8 NMSA 1978 was amended to remove the exemption and require that the pension of a PERA retiree appointed as chief of police after July 1, 2010 be suspended; defendant sought to suspend plaintiff's pension after the city's March 2012 election; and plaintiff claimed that because plaintiff's appointment was for an indefinite term, the exemption remained in effect until plaintiff's term of office terminated, plaintiff's term of office commenced following the March 2010 municipal election and ended when the city held its organizational meeting following the March 2012 election, because municipal appointees serve definitive terms of two years subject to reappointment at the municipality's organizational meeting following each biennial municipal election.City of Artesia v. PERA of N.M., 2014-NMCA-009, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-011.\n\nEffect of 1987 recodification.— The 1987 recodification of the public employees retirement act does not permit a normal or disability retirement pension to be made retroactive. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-15.\n\nWritten application for retirement.— The public employees retirement board may not excuse the statutory requirement that a member file a written application for retirement, even where a member alleges that he made verbal requests of the public employees retirement association for an application form but did not receive the form promptly, since strict compliance with the statutory requirements for receiving retirement benefits is required. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-33.\n\nDeath not treated as retirement.— An employee who dies during employment does not retire, and thus an employee's affidavit directing that his death be treated as his retirement is ineffectual. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-06.\n\nThe general rule under Subsection F(now Subsection D) is that a retiring member who has coverage under two different coverage plans will receive benefits calculated under the provisions of the better coverage plan if the member has three years of credited service under the better coverage plan. If not, the member will receive benefits calculated under the provisions of the lesser coverage plan. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-66.\n\nThe only exception to the general rule under Subsection F(now see Subsection D) is where the retiring member acquires credited service under two coverage plans \"applied to the same affiliated public employer . . . .\" This exception must be strictly construed, because it departs from the general rule, financially impacts the association as imminent retirees make little contribution toward the greater benefits, and envisions potential manipulation and abuse as demonstrated by the association's experience with the \"loopholers\" or \"job jumpers\". 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-66.\n\nThe object to the phrase \"same affiliated public employer\" in Subsection F (now Subsection D) is to prevent \"job jumping\" from a public employer covered under a lower benefit formula to a public employer covered under a higher benefit formula to retire at the higher formula from the second entity after working, if at all, for a brief period of time. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-66.\n\nReappointment after suspension of benefits.— County treasurer could not retire in June, 1988, and resume office as county treasurer without suspension of public employee retirement benefits, if the county commission reappointed him as county treasurer to serve the remainder of his unexpired term, ending December 31, 1988. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-80.\n\nSuspension of benefits upon resumption of employment.— An employee of the department of finance and administration, retired pursuant to the provisions of Public Employee's Retirement Act, may not resume employment with the department of education without suspension of retirement benefits. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-37 (decided under former 10-11-22 NMSA 1978).\n\nAn employee of a public school system, retired pursuant to the provisions of the Educational Retirement Act, may not resume employment with the department of education without suspension of educational retirement benefits. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-38 (decided under former Section 10-11-8 NMSA 1978).\n\nThe suspension provisions of the disbursing systemapply to the benefits granted pursuant to the reciprocity act to a member retired under the public employee retirement association and the educational retirement system who resumes employment. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-22.\n\nPublic Employee Retirement Act annuitants whom the department of education subsequently employsand who elect to participate in the educational retirement system by making contributions to that system do not \"qualify for (retirement) coverage\" under 22-11-17D NMSA 1978, since they are not considered as having acquired any service credit for purposes of educational retirement benefits. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-37 (decided under former Section 10-11-22 NMSA 1978).\n\nException to 3-year credited service requirement.— Because a leave of absence without pay can be distinguished from a termination of employment, is not a complete separation of employment, and denotes continuity of employment status, members who take a bona fide leave of absence without pay are eligible for Subsection F's (now see Subsection D) exception to the three-year credited service requirement for coverage under state general member coverage plan 2. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-19.\n\nReemployment as seasonal employees of legislature.— Retirees of the Public Employees Retirement Association who are reemployed as seasonal employees by the state legislature are subject to benefit suspension when they exceed the maximum earnings permitted by former Subsection C. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-15.",

      "text": "A. There is created a \"disability review committee\" of the retirement board. The disability review committee shall consist of at least three but not more than five retirement board members and at least one physician licensed in New Mexico appointed by the retirement board. The disability review committee shall review all applications for disability retirement, review reports required under this section and approve or deny applications for disability retirement.\n\nB. The disability review committee may retire a member on account of disability before the time the member would otherwise be eligible for retirement if the following requirements are satisfied:\n\n(1) the member applying for disability retirement was a member at the time the disability was incurred;\n\n(2) a written application for disability retirement, in the form and containing the information prescribed by the association, has been filed with the association by the member or by the member's affiliated public employer;\n\n(3) employment is terminated within forty-five days of the date of approval of the application for disability retirement;\n\n(a) the member has the applicable minimum number of years of service credit required for normal retirement. For the purposes of this subparagraph, \"service credit\" means only the service credit earned by the member during periods of employment with an affiliated public employer; or\n\n(b) the disability review committee finds the disability to have been the natural and proximate result of causes arising solely and exclusively out of and in the course of the member's performance of duty with an affiliated public employer;\n\n(5) the member submits to all medical examinations and tests and furnishes copies of all medical reports requested by the association or disability review committee; provided that if the disability review committee requires independent medical or other examinations, those examinations shall be performed at the association's expense; and\n\n(6) the disability review committee makes the determination required under Subsection C of this section.\n\nC. The disability review committee shall review applications for disability retirement to determine whether:\n\n(1) if the member is a currently employed, contributing employee of an affiliated public employer:\n\n(a) the member is mentally or physically totally incapacitated for continued employment with an affiliated public employer; and\n\n(b) the incapacity is likely to be permanent; or\n\n(2) if the member is not a currently employed, contributing employee of an affiliated public employer:\n\n(a) the member is mentally or physically totally incapacitated for any gainful employment; and\n\n(b) the incapacity is likely to be permanent.\n\nD. The disability retirement pension shall be paid for a period of one year after approval of the initial application unless the disability review committee for good cause shown grants disability retirement for a longer period of time. After approval, payment shall be effective commencing the first of the month following submission of the initial application and termination of employment.\n\nE. At the end of the first year that a disability retirement pension is paid, the disability retired member's condition shall be reevaluated to determine eligibility for continuation of payment of a disability retirement pension. If the disability retired member has applied for disability benefits under the federal social security program, the member shall submit copies of the member's application. The association shall continue payment of the state disability retirement pension if the disability retired member presents a written final determination from the federal social security administration that the disability retired member qualifies, based on the same conditions as presented in the application for a state disability retirement pension, for federal disability benefits.\n\nF. If the disability retired member applied for federal disability benefits within thirty days of receiving approval for a state disability retirement pension but the federal social security administration has not made a written final determination of entitlement by the end of the first year that the disability retired member has received a state disability retirement pension, eligibility for continued payment of the state disability retirement pension shall be determined by the disability review committee. The state disability retirement pension shall be discontinued if the disability review committee finds that the disability retired member is capable of any gainful employment.\n\nG. The disability retired member shall notify the association of the federal social security administration's final determination within fifteen working days of the date of issuance of the final written determination. If the federal social security administration denies federal disability benefits, the state disability retirement pension shall be discontinued effective the first of the month following the month in which the written final determination of the federal social security administration was issued. If the federal social security administration grants federal disability benefits, the state disability retirement pension shall be continued so long as the disability retired member provides annually, on or before the anniversary date of commencement of payment of the state disability retirement pension, written evidence of continuation of payment of federal disability benefits. If the disability review committee has denied continuation of payment of a state disability retirement pension and the disability retired member is later granted federal disability benefits, the state disability retirement pension shall be reinstated effective the first of the month following the month in which the state disability retirement pension was discontinued.\n\nH. If, at the time of reevaluation under Subsection E of this section, the disability retired member has applied for and has qualified for federal disability benefits, but for a different condition than was reviewed by the disability review committee, the disability review committee shall review the disability retired member's condition as described by the application for federal disability benefits. The process set forth in Subsection I of this section shall be followed to determine whether payment of a state disability retirement pension should be continued.\n\nI. If the disability retired member is not eligible to apply for federal disability benefits or is not a member of the federal social security program, the disability review committee annually shall determine eligibility for continuation of payment of a state disability retirement pension. To make its determination of continued entitlement, the disability review committee shall use the guidelines established by the federal social security administration for determination of eligibility for federal disability benefits. The determination shall be based on:\n\n(1) the medical and all other information provided by the disability retired member;\n\n(2) at least one independent medical or other examination performed at the association's expense if required by the disability review committee; and\n\n(3) any medical, vocational or other information related to the disability compiled during the period of disability by any medical or other practitioner consulted by the disability retired member regarding the disability which was not paid for by the association.\n\nJ. Each disability retired member annually shall submit to the association, prior to July 1, a statement of earnings from gainful employment during the preceding calendar year. The statement of earnings shall be in the form prescribed by the association. Payment of the state disability retirement pension shall be discontinued if the amount of earnings from gainful employment is one hundred percent or more of the amount that causes a decrease or suspension of an old age benefit under the federal social security program, or fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), whichever is less. Payment of the state disability retirement pension shall be discontinued starting with the month of July if the statement of earnings is not received by the association prior to July 1.\n\nK. Upon prior approval by the association, a disability retired member may return to employment with an affiliated public employer or other employer for a trial period not to exceed one hundred twenty calendar days without becoming a member or causing suspension or discontinuation of payment of a state disability retirement pension. If the trial period of employment is successfully completed, payment of the disability retirement pension shall be discontinued beginning the first of the month following the one hundred twentieth day of the trial period of employment. Trial periods of employment shall be limited to two in any five-year period following disability retirement.\n\nL. If the disability retired member meets the minimum age and service credit requirements for normal retirement while receiving a disability retirement pension, the disability retirement pension shall be reclassified by the association as a normal retirement pension and no further determinations of eligibility for continuation of payment of the disability retirement pension shall be made. Upon reclassification as a normal retirement pension, all the provisions of the Public Employees Retirement Act regarding normal retirement shall be applicable.\n\nM. If the disability review committee found the disability to be the natural and proximate result of causes arising solely and exclusively out of and in the course of the member's employment with an affiliated public employer, service credit shall continue to accrue during the disability retirement period as though the disability retired member was actively employed.\n\nN. The amount of a disability retirement pension shall be calculated according to the provisions of the coverage plan applicable to the member at the time of application, except that the service credit requirement shall be waived and the actual amount of service credit shall be used instead. If the disability is the natural and proximate result of causes arising solely and exclusively out of and in the course of the member's performance of duty for an affiliated public employer, the amount of disability retirement pension shall be calculated according to the provisions of the coverage plan applicable to the member, imputing the amount of service credit necessary to meet the minimum service credit requirements for normal retirement.\n\nO. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:\n\n(1) \"continued employment with the affiliated public employer\" means the ability of the member to fulfill the required duties of the position in which the member was last employed by an affiliated public employer;\n\n(2) \"gainful employment\" means remunerative employment or self-employment that is commensurate with the applicant's background, age, education, experience and any new skills or training the applicant may have acquired after terminating public employment or incurring the disability;\n\n(3) \"state disability retirement pension\" means the pension paid pursuant to the provisions of this section; and\n\n(4) \"federal disability benefits\" means those benefits paid by the federal social security program.\n\nHistory:Laws 1993, ch. 160, § 3; 2013, ch. 225, § 6.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective July 1, 2013, clarified how service credit will be calculated for disabled members; increased the vesting period; in Subparagraph (a) of Paragraph (4) of Subsection B, in the first sentence, after \"the member has\", deleted \"five or more\" and added \"the applicable minimum number of\", and after \"service credit\", added \"required for normal retirement\", and added the second sentence.\n\nSeverability.— Laws 2013, ch. 225, § 93 provided that if any part or application of Laws 2013, ch. 225 is held invalid, the remainder or its application to other situations or persons shall not be affected.\n\nRetirement due to disability.— The requirement that an employee have one and one-half years earned service credit to qualify for payment under coverage plan 3 supplements the service credit requirements for normal requirement and does not apply to employees who apply for early retirement due to a disability.Garcia-Montoya v. Pub. Emps. Ret. Bd., 2006-NMCA-094, 140 N.M. 175, 140 P.3d 1124.\n\nThe operative date for determining an applicant's membership statusfor purposes of disability retirement benefits is the date disability was incurred.Gonzales v. N.M. Pub. Emps. Ret. Ass'n, 2009-NMCA-109, 147 N.M. 201, 218 P.3d 1249.\n\nMembership status is determined as of the date disability was incurred.— Where petitioners were currently employed, contributing members at the time their disabilities were incurred, and petitioners were currently employed but not contributing members at the time they applied for disability retirement benefits, the operative date for determining petitioners' status for purposes of disability retirement benefits was the date disability was incurred and petitioners were required to demonstrate total physical and mental incapacity for continued employment with an affiliated public employer, but not total physical and mental incapacity for any gainful employment.Gonzales v. N.M. Pub. Emps. Ret. Ass'n, 2009-NMCA-109, 147 N.M. 201, 218 P.3d 1249.\n\nPublic employee retirement board's decision denying duty-related benefits arbitrary and capricious.— In an appeal from the denial of disability retirement benefits where the parties did not dispute that petitioner was disabled and that her disability was solely and exclusively a result of her work, and where the hearing officer recommended finding that a preponderance of evidence supported a finding that no pre-existing condition was a significant contributing factor material to petitioner's disability, the public employee retirement board's (board) contrary finding that a pre-existing condition had not been resolved and decision denying duty-related disability benefits was arbitrary and capricious, because the board violated its own regulation by failing to review the record before the hearing officer prior to modifying a proposed finding of fact, failed to provide a reasoned basis for its new findings of fact, and failed to consider contrary evidence, and the board's new findings had no rational basis in light of the whole record.Vigil v. Public Emp. Ret. Bd., 2015-NMCA-079, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-008.\n\nMeaning of \"gainful employment\" in regard to geographic area.— In order to be entitled to disability retirement benefits, an employee must establish that no \"gainful employment\" is attainable within the State of New Mexico, unless the employee presents substantial evidence that the application of this statewide standard to the employee is unreasonable.Talamante v. N.M. Pub. Emps. Ret. Bd., 2006-NMCA-032, 139 N.M. 226, 131 P.3d 76.\n\n\"Commensurate\" employment.— The board failed to comply with the requirements of this section in evaluating claimant's application for disability benefits, because it failed to factually determine whether the work he was able to perform was substantially \"commensurate\", in terms of remuneration with the work he was performing at the time of his disability or would have been capable of performing, absent the disability.Johnson v. Pub. Emps. Ret. Bd., 1998-NMCA-174, 126 N.M. 282, 968 P.2d 793, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 532, 972 P.3d 351.\n\nReturn for \"trial period\".— A disability annuitant retired under the provisions of the Public Employees Retirement Act in effect before July 1, 1987, could return to employment for a \"trial period\" pursuant to Subsection D of former Section 10-11-11 NMSA 1978 (see nowSubsection K). 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-44.\n\nSuspension of benefits when member capable of resuming gainful employment.— To construe Subsection C of former 10-11-11 NMSA 1978 (see now Subsection F) as requiring the retirement board to continue disability benefits to a member who is capable of engaging in gainful employment is wholly foreign to the statutory scheme governing disability benefits, would be a radical departure from former law, is inconsistent, and would amount to reading into the statute significant obligations against the association's funds that the legislature has not contemplated. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-09.\n\nRule adopted by the retirement board, providing for suspension of disability benefits if a member is capable of resuming gainful employment, was consistent with the statutory scheme governing the grant and continuation of disability benefits and was a reasonable implementation of Subsection C of former 10-11-11 NMSA 1978 (see now Subsection F). 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-09.\n\nLegislative intent, as to contributing service.— The five years of contributing service for each employee was placed in former 10-11-10 NMSA 1978 by the legislature, with the intent that it be a safeguard to protect the association and the board from retiring employees for nonduty disability when they enter the service of the state or any of its agencies, and who were already disabled and could work for the state or its agencies for a few weeks or months and then claim nonduty disability. 1956 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 56-6449.\n\nRetroactive award prohibited.— The Public Employees Retirement Association may not award disability benefits retroactive to the date on which the member's name last appeared on the payroll with pay. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-18.\n\nAm.

      "heading": "Death before retirement; survivor pensions.",
      "text": "A. A survivor pension may be paid to certain persons related to or designated by a member who dies before normal or disability retirement if a written application for the pension, in the form prescribed by the association, is filed with the association by the potential survivor beneficiary or beneficiaries within one year of the death of the member. Applications may be filed on behalf of the potential survivor beneficiary or beneficiaries or by a person legally authorized to represent them.\n\nB. If there is no designated survivor beneficiary and the retirement board finds the death to have been the natural and proximate result of causes arising solely and exclusively out of and in the course of the member's performance of duty with an affiliated public employer, a survivor pension shall be payable to the eligible surviving spouse. The amount of the survivor pension shall be the greater of:\n\n(1) the amount as calculated under the coverage plan applicable to the deceased member at the time of death as though the deceased member had retired the day preceding death under form of payment B using the actual amount of service credit attributable to the deceased member at the time of death; or\n\n(2) fifty percent of the deceased member's final average salary.\n\nC. A survivor pension shall also be payable to eligible surviving children if there is no designated survivor beneficiary and the retirement board finds the death to have been the natural and proximate result of causes arising solely and exclusively out of and in the course of the member's performance of duty with an affiliated public employer. The total amount of survivor pension payable for all eligible surviving children shall be either:\n\n(1) fifty percent of the deceased member's final average salary if an eligible surviving spouse is not paid a pension; or\n\n(2) twenty-five percent of the deceased member's final average salary if an eligible surviving spouse is paid a pension.\n\nThe total amount of survivor pension shall be divided equally among all eligible surviving children. If there is only one eligible child, the amount of pension shall be twenty-five percent of the deceased member's final average salary.\n\nD. If the member had the applicable minimum number of years of service credit required for normal retirement, but the retirement board did not find the death to have been the natural and proximate result of causes arising solely and exclusively out of and in the course of the member's performance of duty with an affiliated public employer and there is no designated survivor beneficiary, a survivor pension shall be payable to the eligible surviving spouse. The amount of the survivor pension shall be the greater of:\n\n(1) the amount as calculated under the coverage plan applicable to the deceased member at the time of death as though the deceased member had retired the day preceding death under form of payment B using the total amount of actual service credit attributable to the deceased member at the time of death; or\n\n(2) thirty percent of the deceased member's final average salary.\n\nE. If the member had the applicable minimum number of years of service credit required for normal retirement, but the retirement board did not find the death to have been the natural and proximate result of causes arising solely and exclusively out of and in the course of the member's performance of duty with an affiliated public employer and there is no designated survivor beneficiary, and if there is no eligible surviving spouse at the time of death, a survivor pension shall be payable to and divided equally among all eligible surviving children, if any. The total amount of survivor pension payable for all eligible surviving children shall be the greater of:\n\n(1) the amount as calculated under the coverage plan applicable to the deceased member at the time of death as though the deceased member had retired the day preceding death under form of payment B with the oldest eligible surviving child as the survivor beneficiary using the total amount of actual service credit attributable to the deceased member at the time of death; or\n\n(2) thirty percent of the deceased member's final average salary.\n\nF. An eligible surviving spouse is the spouse to whom the deceased member was married at the time of death. An eligible surviving child is a child under the age of eighteen years and who is an unmarried, natural or adopted child of the deceased member.\n\nG. An eligible surviving spouse's pension shall terminate upon death. An eligible surviving child's pension shall terminate upon death or marriage or reaching age eighteen years, whichever comes first.\n\nH. If there is no designated survivor beneficiary and there is no eligible surviving child, the eligible surviving spouse may elect to be refunded the deceased member's accumulated member contributions instead of receiving a survivor pension.\n\nI. A member may designate a survivor beneficiary to receive a pre-retirement survivor pension, subject to the following conditions:\n\n(1) a written designation, in the form prescribed by the association, is filed by the member with the association;\n\n(2) if the member is married at the time of designation, the designation shall only be made with the consent of the member's spouse, in the form prescribed by the association;\n\n(3) if the member is married subsequent to the time of designation, any prior designations shall automatically be revoked upon the date of the marriage;\n\n(4) if the member is divorced subsequent to the time of designation, any prior designation of the former spouse as survivor beneficiary shall automatically be revoked upon the date of divorce; and\n\n(5) a designation of survivor beneficiary may be changed, with the member's spouse's consent if the member is married, by the member at any time prior to the member's death.\n\nJ. If there is a designated survivor beneficiary and the retirement board finds the death to have been the natural and proximate result of causes arising solely and exclusively out of and in the course of the member's performance of duty with an affiliated public employer, a survivor pension shall be payable to the designated survivor beneficiary. The amount of the survivor pension shall be the greater of:\n\n(1) the amount as calculated under the coverage plan applicable to the deceased member at the time of death as though the deceased member had retired the day preceding death under form of payment B using the actual amount of service credit attributable to the member at the time of death; or\n\n(2) fifty percent of the deceased member's final average salary.\n\nK. If there is a designated survivor beneficiary, if the member had the applicable minimum number of years of service credit required for normal retirement and if the retirement board did not find the death to have been the natural and proximate result of causes arising solely and exclusively out of and in the course of the member's performance of duty with an affiliated public employer, a survivor pension shall be payable to the designated survivor beneficiary. The amount of the survivor pension shall be the greater of:\n\n(1) the amount as calculated under the coverage plan applicable to the deceased member at the time of death as though the deceased member had retired the day preceding death under form of payment B using the actual amount of service credit attributable to the member at the time of death; or\n\n(2) thirty percent of the deceased member's final average salary.\n\nL. If all pension payments permanently terminate before there is paid an aggregate amount equal to the deceased member's accumulated member contributions at time of death, the difference between the amount of accumulated member contributions and the aggregate amount of pension paid shall be paid to the deceased member's refund beneficiary. If no refund beneficiary survives the survivor beneficiary, the difference shall be paid to the estate of the deceased member.\n\nM. For purposes of this section, \"service credit\" means only the service credit earned by a member during periods of employment with an affiliated public employer.\n\nHistory:Laws 1993, ch. 160, § 4; 1997, ch. 189, § 6; 2013, ch. 225, § 7.\n\nThe 2013 amendment,effective July 1, 2013, clarified how service credit will be calculated for survivors of members who die before retirement; increased the vesting period; in Subsection D, in the first sentence, after \"If the member had\", deleted \"five or more\" and added \"the applicable minimum number of\" and after \"service credit\", added \"required for normal retirement\"; in Subsection E, in the first sentence, after \"if the member had\", deleted \"five or more\" and added \"the applicable minimum number of\" and after \"service credit\", added \"required for normal retirement\"; in Subsection K, in the first sentence, after \"If the member had\", deleted \"five or more\" and added \"the applicable minimum number of\" and after the phrase \"service credit\", added \"required for normal retirement\"; and added Subsection M.\n\nSeverability.— Laws 2013, ch. 225, § 93 provided that if any part or application of Laws 2013, ch. 225 is held invalid, the remainder or its application to other situations or persons shall not be affected.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective June 20, 1997, rewrote this section to the extent that a detailed comparison is impracticable.\n\nInterest of surviving spouse.— The vested interest in the pension benefits of a deceased member of the public employees retirement association, who has not retired, does not pass to the deceased member's spouse upon the death of the deceased member. The interest of the surviving spouse is limited to the interest created by the Public Employees Retirement Act. Under the Act, the surviving spouse of a deceased member who had not retired has a property interest only in the survivor's benefit which is conditioned upon the fulfillment of statutory requirements.Martinez v. Pub. Emps. Ret. Ass'n of N.M., 2012-NMCA-096, 286 P.3d 613, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-009.\n\nOne-year limitation to file an application for benefits does not violate due process.— The one-year limitation to file an application for pension benefits and the documentation requirements in Subsection A of Section 10-11-14.5 NMSA 1978 does not violate the substantive due process rights of a survivor beneficiary because they are rationally related to the legitimate government interests of promoting the fiduciary purpose of the Public Employees Retirement Act and preventing fraud.Martinez v. Pub. Emps. Ret. Ass'n of N.M., 2012-NMCA-096, 286 P.3d 613, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-009.\n\nFailure to comply with statutory requirements.— Where plaintiff's spouse, who had worked for the state for seven years and had contributed to the public employees retirement association, died; plaintiff had a property interest in survivor's benefits; plaintiff sent a letter and a copy of the death certificate to defendant in which plaintiff notified defendant of the death of plaintiff's spouse, requested that defendant send plaintiff any paperwork needed to receive a survivor pension, and asked defendant to conduct an audit of the decedent's file to determine the benefits due to plaintiff; defendant sent plaintiff the prescribed application form for survivor benefits and asked plaintiff to complete and return the application; defendant did not notify plaintiff that there was a deadline for submission of the application; and plaintiff sent the completed application to defendant more than two years after plaintiff's spouse died, plaintiff failed to substantially comply with the requirements of Section 10-11-14.5 NMSA 1978 which governed plaintiff's right to survivor benefits, plaintiff's claim for survivor benefits was barred, and plaintiff was not denied substantive due process.Martinez v. Pub. Emps. Ret. Ass'n of N.M., 2012-NMCA-096, 286 P.3d 613, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-009.\n\n\"Final average salary\".— The \"final average salary\" figure may not include lump sum payments for annual leave, sick leave or sick leave converted to annual leave, because such payments are not \"salary\" within the meaning of the Public Employees' Retirement Act. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-06.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —67 C.J.S. Officers and Public Employees § 248; 81A C.J.S. States §§ 46, 112 to 119.",

The section provided that an employee could purchase up to five years of credited service \"during the seventy-fifth or seventy-sixth fiscal year,\" subject to various conditions. Not only was the statute ambiguous by referring to both the seventy-fifth and seventy-sixth fiscal years at the same time, it was also internally inconsistent; the cost for an additional year of service credit had already been fixed by Section 3 of the 1986 amendment to this article (Chapter 89), and no one argues that § 139 was intended to change that cost, retroactively, to comport with the formula spelled out later in § 139. Thus, the early retirees in the seventy-sixth fiscal year under Laws 1987, ch. 253, § 139 were required to pay an equivalent amount to purchase service credits as paid by early retirees under Laws 1986, ch. 89, § 3.State ex rel.

      "text": "A. The member contribution fund is the accounting fund in which shall be accumulated contributions of members and from which shall be made refunds and transfers of accumulated member contributions as provided in the Public Employees Retirement Act. Each affiliated public employer shall cause the member contributions specified by the coverage plan applicable to each of that affiliated public employer's members to be deducted from the salary of each member. Each affiliated public employer shall remit the deducted member contributions to the association in accordance with the procedures and schedules established by the association. The association may assess an interest charge and a penalty charge on any remittance not made by its due date. Each member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions made and provided for in this section by continuing employment with the affiliated public employer. Contributions by members shall be credited to the members' individual accounts in the member contribution fund.\n\nB. A member's accumulated contributions shall be transferred to the retirement reserve fund if a pension becomes payable upon the retirement or death of the member. If a disability retirement pension is terminated for a reason other than the death of the disability retired member before an amount equal to the disability retired member's accumulated member contributions has been paid, the unexpended balance of the accumulated member contributions shall be transferred from the retirement reserve fund to the former disability retired member's individual account in the member contribution fund.\n\nC. If a member terminates affiliated public employment or is on leave of absence from an affiliated public employer as a consequence of the entry into active duty with the armed forces of the United States, the member may, with the written consent of the member's spouse, if any, withdraw the member's accumulated member contributions, upon making written request in a form prescribed by the association. Upon written request of the member in the form prescribed by the association, a refund of member contributions may be made by a trustee-to-trustee transfer of the contributions from the member contribution fund directly to another qualified plan as allowed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Withdrawal of member contributions shall result in forfeiture of the service credit accrued for the period during which the contributions were made.\n\nD. A member shall, upon commencement of membership, designate a refund beneficiary who shall receive the refund of the member contributions, plus interest if any, if the member dies and no survivor pension is payable. If the member is married at the time of designation, written spousal consent shall be required if the designated refund beneficiary is other than the spouse or a supplemental needs trust to which the spouse is a beneficiary. Marriage subsequent to the designation shall automatically revoke a previous designation, and the spouse shall become the refund beneficiary unless or until another designation is filed with the association. Divorce subsequent to the designation shall automatically revoke designation of the former spouse as refund beneficiary, or the right of the former spouse to be refund beneficiary if no designation has been filed, and the refund shall be paid to the deceased member's estate unless the member filed a designation of refund beneficiary subsequent to the divorce. The refund shall be paid to the refund beneficiary named in the most recent designation of refund beneficiary on file with the association unless that beneficiary is deceased or otherwise terminated. If there is not a living or operating refund beneficiary named in the most recent designation of refund beneficiary on file with the association, the deceased member's accumulated member contributions shall be paid to the estate of the deceased member.\n\nHistory:Laws 1987, ch. 253, § 124; 1993, ch. 160, § 6; 2023, ch. 156, § 4.\n\nCross references.— For the Internal Revenue Code,see26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, allowed a supplemental needs trust to be named as a survivor or refund beneficiary; and in Subsection D, after \"other than the spouse\", added \"or a supplemental needs trust to which the spouse is a beneficiary\", after \"unless that beneficiary is deceased\", added \"or otherwise terminated\", and after \"not a living\", added \"or operating\".\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, in Subsection B, deleted \"or vested former member\" from the end of the first sentence and inserted \"retirement\" in one place and \"disability\" in three places in the second sentence; rewrote Subsection C; in Subsection D, added the first through fourth sentences, substituted \"The refund\" for \"If a member or former member dies and no pension becomes payable on account of the death, the deceased member's or former member's accumulated member contributions\" at the beginning of the fifth sentence, and deleted \"or former member's\" following \"deceased member's\" and \"or former member\" following \"deceased member\" in the last sentence; and deleted Subsection E, which provided for transfer of unclaimed member contributions to the income fund.\n\nWhere mandatory duty on department heads.— By the very wording of the statute a mandatory duty is placed upon each department head to see that proper deductions are made from eligible employees' salaries so that proper credit can be received by such employees under the terms and provisions of the public employees' retirement system of New Mexico. 1956 Op.

The retirement board consists of:\n\n(1) the secretary of state;\n\n(2) the state treasurer;\n\n(3) four members under a state coverage plan to be elected by the members under state coverage plans;\n\n(4) four members under a municipal coverage plan to be elected by the members under municipal coverage plans, provided one member shall be a municipal member employed by a county; and\n\n(5) two retired members to be elected by the retired members of the association.\n\nC. The results of elections of elected members of the retirement board shall be certified at the annual meeting of the association. Elections shall be conducted according to rules the retirement board adopts from time to time.\n\nD. The regular term of office of the elected members of the retirement board is four years. The term of one retirement board member under a state coverage plan expires annually on December 31. The terms of retirement board members under a municipal coverage plan expire on December 31 of noncoinciding years in the pattern set by the retirement board. Members of the retirement board serve until their successors have qualified.\n\nE. A member elected to the retirement board who fails to attend four consecutively scheduled meetings of the retirement board, unless in each case excused for cause by the retirement board members in attendance, is considered to have resigned from the retirement board, and the retirement board shall by resolution declare the office vacated as of the date of adoption of the resolution. A vacancy occurring on the retirement board, except in the case of an elected official, shall be filled by the remaining retirement board members, without requirement that a quorum be present.

Special meetings of the members of the association shall be held in Santa Fe upon call of any seven retirement board members. The retirement board shall send a written notice to the last known residence address of each member currently employed by an affiliated public employer at least ten days prior to any meeting of the members of the association. The notice shall contain the call of the meeting and the principal purpose of the meeting. All meetings of the association shall be public and shall be conducted according to procedures the retirement board shall from time to time adopt. The retirement board shall keep a record of the proceedings of each meeting of the association.\n\nI. Neither the retirement board nor the association shall allow public inspection of, or disclosure of, information from any member or retiree file unless a prior release and consent, in the form prescribed by the association, has been executed by the member or retiree; except that applicable coverage plans, amounts of retirement plan contributions made by members and affiliated public employers, pension amounts paid and the names and addresses of public employees retirement association members or retirees requested for election purposes by candidates for election to the retirement board may be produced or disclosed without release or consent.\n\nHistory:Laws 1987, ch. 253, § 130; 1992, ch. 116, § 10; 1995, ch. 115, § 2; 1997, ch. 189, § 9; 2005, ch. 147, § 1; 2011, ch. 27, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For the federal Internal Revenue Code,see26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.\n\nThe 2011 amendment,effective June 17, 2011, authorized the board to select a custodian bank.\n\nTemporary provisions.— Laws 2011, ch. 178, § 14 provided:\n\nA. No later than September 30, 2013, the retirement board of the public employees retirement association and the educational retirement board shall each cause an actuarial study to be conducted for each retirement system administered by the board. Each study shall analyze whether the higher employee contribution rates and lower employer contribution rates required by Laws 2011, Chapter 178 and Laws 2009, Chapter 127 have had or will have an adverse actuarial effect on the retirement system in violation of Article 20, Section 22 of the constitution of New Mexico. The results of each study shall be submitted to the legislative finance committee and the governor.\n\nB. If a study concludes that a retirement system has had or will have an adverse actuarial effect as a result of the higher employee contribution rates and the lower employer contribution rates required by Laws 2011, Chapter 178 and Laws 2009, Chapter 127, the board that administers that retirement system shall submit a request for a supplemental appropriation to the second session of the fifty-first legislature in the amount that will rectify the adverse actuarial effect.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective April 5, 2005, added Subsection A(9) to grant the power to acquire land and build a new building on the land to house the public employees retirement association.\n\nThe 1997 amendment,effective June 20, 1997, in Paragraph A(2), inserted \"and notwithstanding any other provision of law\", inserted \"or contract with and compensate\" and inserted \"and litigation\"; rewrote Subsection C; in Subsection E, separated the former last sentence into two sentences, deleted \"until the next election of the association, at which time a successor shall be elected\" following \"present\" and added \"The member appointed to fill the vacancy shall serve\" at the beginning of the last sentence; and added Subsection I.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, substituted \"two retired members\" for \"one retired member\" in Subsection B(5) and \"retirement board members\" for \"retirement board member\" in Subsection F.\n\nThe 1992 amendment,effective July 1, 1992, inserted \"and the funds created by the state retirement system acts\" and substituted \"state retirement system acts\" for \"Public Employees Retirement Act\" in the introductory paragraph of Subsection A; substituted \"state retirement system acts\" for \"Public Employees Retirement Act\" and \"those acts\" for \"that act\" in Subsection A(1); deleted \"and, in the discretion of the retirement board\" at the end of Subsection A(2); substituted \"capitol\" for \"capital\" and deleted \"public employees retirement\" preceding \"association\" near the beginning of Subsection A(8); substituted \"Internal Revenue Code of 1986\" for \"Internal Revenue Code of the United States\" in Subsection A(9); deleted \"at least\" following \"provided\" in Subsection B(4); and, in Subsection H, inserted \"currently employed by an affiliated public employer\" in the third sentence, while adding \"of the members of the association\" at the end of that sentence.\n\nEffect of employment termination on board membership.— There is nothing in the [Public Employees] Retirement Act for the termination of membership on the retirement board upon termination of employment. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-191.\n\nThe public office of member of the Public Employees Retirement Board,a state agency, is a nonsalaried, policy-making position. Board members have no constitutionally protected property interest in the position. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-24.\n\nAmendment to board rule concerning nominations to the board was legal,where the board complied with procedural rule-making requirements, the rule did not conflict with the board's statutory authority, and the amendment did not operate retroactively to divest any nominee of any vested right. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-24.\n\nRule limiting member composition to one member complies with subsection.— Subsection B(4) requires that \"at least one\" municipal member on the board be a county employee, but does not require that more than one be a county employee. Therefore, a board rule limiting the municipal member composition to only one county member complies with the subsection. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-24. (decided prior to 1992 amendment.)\n\nThe public employee retirement association possesses the legal authority to deduct union dues, and the administrative costs of such deductions, from pension benefits.— The Public Employees Retirement Act (act) does not address whether the public employees retirement association (PERA) may deduct union dues for its beneficiaries that are also union members, but it does appear that the policy purpose behind the act is to ensure that members benefit from a state-backed retirement plan that accounts for membership needs, including remittance or withholding of funds on behalf of its members, and therefore, where a subsection of PERA's beneficiaries sought dues deductions from their respective benefit amounts for union membership, PERA had the legal authority to deduct union dues from pension benefits of PERA members who are also members of unions. Furthermore, if this subsection of beneficiaries consent to absorbing the administrative costs that accompany the deductions and subsequent remittances to the unions, the subject beneficiaries are knowingly and willingly accepting those administrative costs, which would also appear to comply with the act.PERA Deduction of Dues from PERA Retirement Benefits for RPENM and AFSCME Members and Reimbursement of PERA's Administrative Costs for the Dues Deduction(8/25/21), Att'y Gen.

State, 1996-NMSC-001, 121 N.M. 212, 910 P.2d 288.\n\nBecause the retirement plan provided no contractual or vested right to receive an irrevocable tax exemption, there was no constitutionally protected private interest in the tax exemption and there was no due process violation when the exemption was repealed.Pierce v. State, 1996-NMSC-001, 121 N.M. 212, 910 P.2d 288.\n\nIncome tax exemptions may be properly denied.— The legislature may grant a special income tax exemption to one kind of public employee, teachers, yet deny the same exemption to other public employees.Vaughn v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1982-NMCA-112, 98 N.M. 362, 648 P.2d 820.\n\nEnactment reflects legislative recognition.— This enactment is simply a recognition by the legislature that for the most part persons drawing state retirement benefits are those of advanced age whose economic situation in living on a small fixed income in a period of rising prices is already perilous. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-13.\n\nEffect of state income tax amendments.— The 1961 amendment of the statutes relative to state income tax did not have the effect of making annuities and benefits paid pursuant to the Public Employees' Retirement Act subject to state income tax. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-13.\n\n\"Trading\" tax exemptions for health care.— Repeal of the state income tax exemptions for teacher pensions and public employee pensions does not remedy constitutional defects of the proposed retiree health care act under a theory that those exemptions would be \"traded\" for retiree health care. Those exemptions are not property rights, irrepealable contractual entitlements, or pension benefits. Hence, elimination of the favorable tax treatment for current retirees is not consideration for a multi-million dollar health care plan that the state proposes to provide them. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 90-03.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Attachment in New Mexico - Part II,\" see 2 Nat. Resources J. 75 (1962).",
