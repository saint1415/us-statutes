      "text": "Chapter 10, Article 9 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Personnel Act\".\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-4-28, enacted by Laws 1961, ch. 240, § 1; 2009, ch. 76, § 1.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The term \"this act\", referred to in this section, refers to Laws 1961, ch. 240, the provisions of which are presently compiled as 10-9-1 to 10-9-4, 10-9-8 to 10-9-10, 10-9-12, 10-9-13 and 10-9-15 to 10-9-17 and 10-9-20 to 10-9-25 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective June 19, 2009, changed the reference to the act to the Chapter and Article of NMSA 1978.\n\nAttorney general barred from raising defenses.— Doctrine of offensive collateral estoppel barred the attorney general from raising as defenses to an action for a declaration of the validity of a collective bargaining agreement essentially the same defenses to essentially the same substantive contract provisions he raised at the district court level in a prior case involving identical subject matter.Local 2839 of AFSCME v. Udall, 1991-NMSC-017, 111 N.M. 432, 806 P.2d 572.\n\nCollective bargaining authority.— In New Mexico, there is an implied authority to bargain collectively in the public sector as an incident to the express grant of authority under the Personnel Act.Local 2238 of AFSCME v. Stratton, 1989-NMSC-003, 108 N.M. 163, 769 P.2d 76.\n\nApplication to nonexempt employees of retiree health care authority.— Although the Retiree Health Care Act provides in Section 10-7C-7 NMSA 1978 that the retiree health care authority's board may \"employ or contract for persons to assist it . . . and determine the duties and compensation of these employees,\" that authority does not conflict with the Personnel Act and, therefore, the Personnel Act applies to nonexempt employees of the agency. 1991 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 91-06.\n\nAct preemptive of collective bargaining.— Where the legislature has undertaken to act to regulate employment, such action preempts the authority of the state agency to engage in collective bargaining, and the purpose of the Personnel Act is inconsistent with the idea of collective bargaining. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-41 (overruling and withdrawing 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-96).\n\nRules for labor-management relations.— Even if the legislature could delegate its power to make law concerning public sector collective bargaining, and even if it intended to do so in this act, it failed to do so properly, and the rules for labor-management relations promulgated by the personnel board are therefore void and a nullity, since the Personnel Act does not mention collective bargaining, much less any standards to guide the board in fashioning the RLMR. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-41,overruled byLocal 2238 of AFSCME v. Stratton, 1989-NMSC-003, 108 N.M. 163, 769 P.2d 76.\n\nRules constituting unlawful delegation of authority.— The rules for labor-management relations promulgated by the personnel board unlawfully delegate the board's authority over personnel matters that the legislature has placed with the board. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-41,overruled byLocal 2238 of AFSCME v. Stratton, 1989-NMSC-003, 108 N.M. 163, 769 P.2d 76.\n\nState land office.— The state land office is presently subject to the Personnel Act. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-99.\n\nMedical center covered by act.— The Los Lunas state hospital and training school (now the Los Lunas medical center) is a state institution and it falls within the category of departments covered by the Personnel Act. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-80.\n\nAgencies already with merit systems.— Nothing in the Personnel Act indicates that agencies that have adopted merit systems are thereby exempted from the operation of the Personnel Act. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-229 (decided under former law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For note, \"Public Labor Disputes - A Suggested Approach for New Mexico,\" see 1 N.M.L. Rev. 281 (1971).\n\nFor comment, \"Contemplating the Dilemma of Government as Speaker: Judicially Identified Limits on Government Speech in the Context of Carter v.

      "text": "The purpose of the Personnel Act is to establish for New Mexico a system of personnel administration based solely on qualification and ability, which will provide greater economy and efficiency in the management of state affairs. The Personnel Act is enacted under and pursuant to the provisions of Article 7, Section 2 of the constitution of New Mexico, as amended.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-4-29, enacted by Laws 1961, ch. 240, § 2; 1963, ch. 200, § 1.\n\nPurpose and interpretation of Personnel Act.— The Personnel Act has for its basic purpose the furtherance of economy and efficiency in state government. To achieve this purpose and implement the objectives of the act, the provisions providing for the right of an administrative hearing and judicial review should not be narrowly interpreted so as to restrict such a view.Montoya v. Dep't of Fin. & Admin., 1982-NMCA-051, 98 N.M. 408, 649 P.2d 476.\n\nLegislative intent.— In enacting the Personnel Act it was the desire of the legislature to insulate in some manner the paid state employee from the whims and caprice of the political election so as to provide continuity of government in a changing environment. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-7.\n\nLegislature intended balance between internal and statewide administration.— The legislature intended to strike a balance between the inherent power of a state agency or department to act administratively to adjust or organize itself internally so as to more effectively and efficiently carry out its duties, and the statutory objective of establishing and creating an effective system of state personnel administration. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-33.\n\nAbility of government to be enhanced.— The legislature wished to enhance the ability of government by insuring that the \"sifting system\" of the public election be replaced by objective examinations to assure that competent citizens are initially selected for the \"insulated\" positions. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-7.\n\nMerit system provided.— The Personnel Act provides for a merit system, but not a seniority system. 1965 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 65-78A.\n\nState agencies not to engage in collective bargaining.— A collective bargaining agreement between the division of vocational rehabilitation and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees is void, as it is illegal for state agencies governed by the provisions of this article to engage in collective bargaining. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-56.\n\nAm.

N.M. Children, Youth & Families Dep't, 1999-NMCA-114, 128 N.M. 18, 988 P.2d 888.\n\nEmployer.— The regulation and licensing department was an employer within the definition found in the State Personnel Act (10-9-3E NMSA 1978) since it, not the New Mexico real estate commission (NMREC), hired the employee, employee's title fell under the department, employee's hiring was approved by the superintendent of the department, and the power to control the administration of NMREC necessarily includes the hiring and firing of its employees.N.M. Regulation & Licensing Dep't v. Lujan, 1999-NMCA-059, 127 N.M. 233, 979 P.2d 744.\n\nEffect on person contemplated by 28-15-1 NMSA 1978.— If a person contemplated by 28-15-1 NMSA 1978 has gained the status of an \"employee\" as that term is defined by this section and the personnel board rules, he will have additional rights under the state personnel board rules that a \"probationer\" would not. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-108.\n\nEmployees not entitled to participate.— Since the employees of an intercommunity gas association worked for a corporation controlled by three separate municipalities rather than for the state itself, such employees were not entitled to participate under the provisions of the State Personnel Act. 1966 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 66-07.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —81A C.J.S. States § 86.",

King, 537 F.2d 385 (10th Cir. 1976).\n\nRemoval of personnel from policy-making positions.— By exempting members of boards and commissions and agency heads from the Personnel Act, under Subsection B, the legislature acknowledges that such policy-making positions are different from other types of employment positions and that such category of persons are not entitled to hearings, provided for by 10-9-13H NMSA 1978, before removal from their positions.State ex rel. Duran v. Anaya, 1985-NMSC-044, 102 N.M. 609, 698 P.2d 882.\n\nThe Personnel Act applies to all state employees unless specifically excluded.— Where, in 2015, the newly elected New Mexico attorney general, before taking office, terminated certain employees within the office of the attorney general (OAG), and where the employees appealed to the state personnel board (board) claiming that 10-9-4 NMSA 1978 made all employees of the OAG classified employees who could not be discharged without the procedural protections of the Personnel Act, 10-9-1 to -25 NMSA 1978, and where the attorney general claimed that all employees of the OAG are exempt because they all serve at the pleasure of the attorney general pursuant to 8-5-5 NMSA 1978, the board erred in concluding that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the employees' appeal on the ground that the employees were not entitled to the protections of the Personnel Act, because the Personnel Act, as a comprehensive revision of the law on the subject of state public employment, supersedes 8-5-5 NMSA 1978, and the plain language of this section specifically provides that the Personnel Act applies to \"all state positions\" except those falling within specific categories.Landau v. N.M. Att'y Gen., 2019-NMCA-041, cert. denied.\n\nPurposes underlying exemptions.— The purposes underlying the exemption of certain classes of employees are not to preclude them from benefits such as vacation and sick leave. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-47.\n\nMeaning of \"division\".— In determining whether departments are \"divisions\" for purposes of Personnel Act coverage, it is well to keep in mind that there is nothing magic in the word \"division\"; whether a subdivision of a governmental agency is termed a unit, department, bureau or something else is not the determining factor. Rather the critical determination is whether the subdivision is a major component within the internal administrative framework of the state agency, with certain policy-making powers vested in the head of the \"unit\"; if so, the department or unit is a \"division\" within the meaning of the Personnel Act. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-90.\n\nCertain positions exempt.— The following departments, agencies, offices, etc., are exempt from the Personnel Act because they are neither (1) not state positions within the meaning of the act or (2) they are not official state agencies within the meaning of the act: district judges, New Mexico historical society and probation officers. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-28.\n\nEmploying agency's determination of exemption prima facie correct.— When an employing agency employs a person to hold an exempt position and so notifies the personnel department (personnel director), the determination by the employing agency is to be considered as prima facie correct. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-105.\n\nStatus of classified employees upon transfer to successor department.— If classified personnel of a department are transferred to a new, supplanting department, the personnel retain the same classified status and position that they held in the former department and are thus within the coverage of the Personnel Act, 10-9-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.; if a classified position is to become exempt from the provisions of the Personnel Act, then it must first become vacant. 1983 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 83-03.\n\nAssociate museum directors exempt.— The four associate directors of the museum of New Mexico are exempt from the Personnel Act under Subsection C. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-19.\n\nJudicial employees are specifically exemptfrom the Personnel Act. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-47.\n\nCoverage of insurance department personnel.— All insurance department personnel are covered under the Personnel Act except those, if any, who have been properly excluded under the provisions of this section. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-121.\n\nClassification of corrections department teachers.— Teachers employed by the department of corrections should be classified as state employees under the State Personnel Act. 1974 Op.

Board of Regents of U.N.M., 2012-NMCA-055, 278 P.3d 1043, cert. denied, 2012-NMCERT-004.\n\nWhere a university manager was terminated by the university; the manager did not follow the grievance process contained in the university's employee handbook by filing a grievance; the handbook governed the manager's employment with the university; and the manager filed an action in district court for breach of contract and wrongful termination alleging that the employee handbook created a contract and that the university breached the contract by failing to abide by the handbook's policies and procedures governing workplace performance, disciplinary action, a harassment-free workplace, employer-employee relations, progressive discipline and by disciplining the manager without just cause, the manager's claims were barred because the manager failed to exhaust the handbook's internal grievance procedures before filing the breach of contract action based on an alleged failure of the university to follow policies in the handbook.Lucero v.

N.M. Dep't of Workforce Solutions, 2012-NMCA-059, 278 P.3d 1047.\n\nMisconduct.— The actions of appellant in direct contravention of appellant's superior's instructions to stop yelling at others at the staff meeting was a sufficient basis upon which appellant's supervisors, the state personnel board and the district court could reasonably find misconduct by the appellant within the definition of Rule 14.7(C) of the state personnel rules; the appellant had the status of a supervisor and as such, appellant's behavior and conduct while on duty and while serving the public and individuals who had business with the agency affected the efficiency of the agency.Romero v. Employment Sec. Dep't, 1984-NMCA-111, 102 N.M. 71, 691 P.2d 72.\n\nRules adopted by board may not abridge statutory rights and duties.— The board has the statutory authority to adopt rules; however, the rules adopted may not abridge the rights or duties imposed by statute.State ex rel.

Silva, 1982-NMCA-121, 98 N.M. 549, 650 P.2d 833.\n\nAccrual of annual vacation leave.— Juvenile probation officers and their staff who were transferred from the New Mexico judicial branch to the New Mexico executive branch pursuant to the Youth Authority Act, Laws 1988, ch. 101, § 8, were not permitted to continue to accrue annual vacation leave at judicial branch rates under § 47(C) of the act. The rate of accrual of annual leave was not an \"accrued benefit\" under the plain meaning and structure of § 47(C), which clearly required transferred juvenile probation officers to accrue annual leave at Personnel Act rates from the time of transfer to the executive branch.Whitely v. N.M. State Personnel Bd., 1993-NMSC-019, 115 N.M. 308, 850 P.2d 1011.\n\nRemoval of personnel from policy-making positions.— By exempting members of boards and commissions and agency heads from the Personnel Act under Section 10-9-4B NMSA 1978, the legislature acknowledges that such policy-making positions are different from other types of employment positions and that such category of persons are not entitled to hearings, provided for by Subsection H of this section, before removal from their positions.State ex rel. Duran v. Anaya, 1985-NMSC-044, 102 N.M. 609, 698 P.2d 882.\n\nCollective bargaining contractswith governmental employees cannot in any way conflict with, contradict, expand or enlarge the rules of labor-management relations adopted by the state personnel board or any other governmental entity acting in this regard. The same applies to any merit system in place or to be adopted in the future.Local 2238 of AFSCME v. Stratton, 1989-NMSC-003, 108 N.M. 163, 769 P.2d 76.\n\nChange of definition that denied sick leave incentive benefit.— Where a collective bargaining agreement permitted employees who were assigned to shift work in a twenty-four hour facility and who did not utilize sick leave for a calendar quarter to receive eight hours of administrative leave; after an arbitrator decided that the sick leave incentive benefit did not apply only to workers who worked an assignment that constituted an unending twenty-four-hour coverage of the job, the state personnel board adopted a regulation that defined \"shift work schedule\" to be a normal work schedule assigned to an employee as part of a rotating group of individuals that must continuously maintain a twenty-four hour operation; and the union claimed that some state agencies had in the past given the sick leave incentive to workers working in a twenty-four-hour facility even when the workers did not work in a position requiring continuous shifts within a twenty-four hour period, that the state used the new definition to deny the benefit to workers in jobs that did not require twenty-four hour coverage, that the board attempted to circumvent the arbitrator's decision by adopting a definition that was the opposite of the definition the arbitrator had adopted, that the regulation denied sick leave incentive pay that the state had contractually agreed to provide and had paid in the past, and that the regulation impaired the agreement in violation of the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution and the New Mexico Constitution, the union's complaint adequately pled that the regulation would substantially impair an existing contract right so as to make the regulation unconstitutionally retroactive and stated a cause of action on which relief could be granted.AFSCME Council 18 v. State of N.M., 2013-NMCA-106.\n\nNo valid delegation of authority to promulgate rules.— The words \"among other things\" at the beginning of this section do not constitute a valid delegation of legislative power, authorizing the personnel board to promulgate rules allowing state employees to bargain collectively with state agencies, since the state constitution commits New Mexico to the doctrine of separation of powers and vests the legislative powers in the legislature. It is fundamental that no one of the three branches can delegate effectively any of the powers which belong to it. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-41,overruled byLocal 2238 of AFSCME v. Stratton, 1989-NMSC-003, 108 N.M. 163, 769 P.2d 76.\n\nNo presumptive ratification of rules.— Legislative acquiescence in and ratification of the rules for labor-management relations promulgated by the personnel board should not be presumed because the legislature did not disapprove collective bargaining when it amended this section in 1975 and Section 10-9-18 NMSA 1978 in 1980. 1987 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-41.\n\nRequiring physical examination.— The state personnel board has the authority to require a physical examination of all applicants for employment. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen.

Att'y Gen. No. 64-121.\n\nGranting of overtime pay or time-off.— There is no prohibition against the cattle sanitary board (now livestock board) paying its employees engaged in inspecting meat overtime pay or granting compensatory time-off for the extra hours worked. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-20.\n\nGenerally, as to specific work hours.— There is no requirement contained in the New Mexico constitution or statutes that work be done at any specific hours of the day. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-89.\n\nEight-hour days.— There is no specific requirement, either constitutional or statutory, requiring that employees of the state work an eight-hour day. 1967 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 67-89.\n\nClassification of personnel file as confidential.— Under the rule-making authority of this section and 10-9-10 NMSA 1978, the state personnel board has a limited and restricted right to classify as confidential certain portions of an individual's personnel file which would not otherwise be made available to the state unless on a confidential or restricted basis. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-19.\n\nSalary matter of public record.— An employee's salary, kept and published under this section, is a matter of public record under 14-2-1 NMSA 1978. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-110.\n\nTest score and position.— A job applicant's test score and position on an eligibility list under this section, possessed by the state personnel office, is a public record under 14-2-1 NMSA 1978. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-110.\n\nMedical and employment histories.— The medical history and employment history solicited from an applicant's previous employer, under this section, are not public records under 14-2-1 NMSA 1978. 1968 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 68-110.\n\nGenerally, as to employment termination and pay.— Terminal leave pay is available to involuntarily terminated employees at the discretion of the appointing authority. Terminal leave pay is available to voluntarily resigning employees as a matter of right. The only limitations upon the power of the appointing authority to dismiss are that notice must be given in writing to the dismissed employee and an authorized reason for dismissal must be stated therein. The only limitation on the right of the voluntarily resigning employee to terminal pay is the requirement that he must give 14 days' notice to the appointing authority. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-213.\n\nPhysician dismissal by miners' hospital board.— The miners' hospital board may dismiss a physician in their employment for not abiding by the rules and regulations of the hospital board, but the physician has the right to appeal the dismissal to the personnel board. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-130.\n\nDismissal of employees.— The miners' hospital board has the power to remove or discharge any employee, but it must exercise this power in accordance with the rules promulgated by the personnel board. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-130.\n\nRight to board hearing.— An employee covered by the Personnel Act has a right to a personnel board hearing on his dismissal when the reason given for the dismissal is administrative change and a reduction in personnel. 1962 Op.

No. 63-105.\n\nThe status and compensation of unclassified (exempt) employees is of no concern to the personnel department (personnel director), as its statutory authority is limited to the \"service\" defined in Subsection C of Section 10-9-3 NMSA 1978. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-105.\n\nDepartment of finance and administration corrects computation errors.— If an objection of the personnel office (personnel director) to a payroll voucher goes to errors in computation or something of like nature, it is for the department of finance and administration to see that such errors are corrected. 1963 Op.

No. 63-105.\n\nExemption questions determined by attorney general.— The department of finance and administration is to honor a payroll voucher so long as it meets that department's requirements, but if the personnel department is of the opinion that a position is not exempt from coverage under the Personnel Act, a legal question involving statutory interpretation arises, and the matter should be referred to the office of the attorney general for determination. 1963 Op.

      "text": "A. An employee who is dismissed, demoted or suspended may, within thirty days after the dismissal, demotion or suspension, appeal to the board. The appealing employee and the agency whose action is reviewed have the right to be heard publicly and to present facts pertinent to the appeal.\n\nB. An applicant denied permission to take an examination or who is disqualified may appeal to the board.\n\nC. The technical rules of evidence shall not apply to appeals to the board.\n\nD. A record shall be made of the hearing, which shall be transcribed if there is an appeal to the district court. Costs of the transcripts, including one copy for the board, shall be paid initially by the agency. The cost of the transcripts may be assessed by the court to the losing party on appeal.\n\nE. The board may designate a hearing officer who may be a member of the board or any qualified state employee to preside over and take evidence at any hearing held pursuant to this section. The hearing officer shall prepare and submit to the board a summary of the evidence taken at the hearing and proposed findings of fact. The board shall render a decision, which shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\nF. If the board finds that the action taken by the agency was without just cause, the board may modify the disciplinary action or order the agency to reinstate the appealing employee to the employee's former position or to a position of like status and pay. Every consideration shall be given to placing the appealing employee in the same geographical location in which the employee was employed prior to the disciplinary action. The board may recommend that the appealing employee be reinstated by an agency other than the one that disciplined the appealing employee. When the board orders an agency to reinstate an appealing employee, the reinstatement shall be effective within thirty days of the board's order. The board may award back pay as of the date of the dismissal, demotion or suspension or as of the later date as the board may specify.\n\nG. A party aggrieved by the decision of the board made pursuant to this section may appeal the decision to the district court pursuant to the provisions of Section 39-3-1.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nH. Where the public employer has entered into a collective bargaining agreement pursuant to the Public Employee Bargaining Act [Chapter 10, Article 7E NMSA 1978] covering the employee, such an employee who is dismissed, demoted or suspended may, within thirty days after the dismissal, demotion or suspension, irrevocably elect to appeal the action through arbitration. An appeal under this subsection shall be conducted in accordance with procedures and requirements as set forth in Subsections A, C and D of this section. The arbitrator shall have all of the powers of the board as set forth in Subsection F of this section. A party aggrieved by the decision of the arbitrator may appeal the decision pursuant to Subsection G of this section. The selection of an arbitrator shall be conducted in accordance with selection procedures set forth in the collective bargaining agreement that covers the employee.\n\nHistory:1978 Comp., § 10-9-18, enacted by Laws 1980, ch. 47, § 2; 1998, ch. 55, § 21; 1999, ch. 265, § 21; 2009, ch. 76, § 2.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1980, ch. 47, § 2, repealed former 10-9-18 NMSA 1978, relating to appeals by employees to the personnel board, and enacted a new section.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The reference to the \"board\" thoughout this section apparently means the personnel board.See10-9-3 NMSA 1978 and notes thereto.\n\nCross references.— For appeal of final decisions by agencies to district court,see39-3-1.1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor procedures governing administrative appeals to the district court,seeRule 1-074 NMRA.\n\nThe 2009 amendment,effective June 19, 2009, added Subsection H.\n\nThe 1999 amendment,effective July 1, 1999, substituted \"Section 39-3-1.1\" for \"Section 12-8A-1\" in Subsection G.\n\nThe 1998 amendment,effective September 1, 1998, in Subsection D, substituted \"assessed\" for \"assesed\"; rewrote Subsection G and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.\n\nRight to hearing to challenge termination.— Federal law and, in general, New Mexico law require that when a state employee is terminated, that employee has a right to a hearing to challenge the termination.Copelin-Brown v. N.M. State Personnel Office, 399 F.3d 1248 (10th Cir. 2005)\n\nThree-day mailing rule and notice of appeal.— While Subsection A of this section does provide that a notice of appeal to the state personnel board shall be filed within 30 days of the notice of termination, this language does not prohibit the board from adopting a three-day mailing rule to provide due process.N.M. Dep't of Health v. Ulibarri, 1993-NMCA-048, 115 N.M. 413, 852 P.2d 686.\n\nSection does not prevent regular cost assessment.— This section is a specific statute that provides only for the cost of the transcript; it does not prevail over the general statutes and rules governing costs.State ex rel. N.M. State Highway & Transp. Dep't v. Baca, 1993-NMCA-149, 116 N.M. 751, 867 P.2d 421,rev'd in part on other grounds, 1995-NMSC-033, 120 N.M. 1, 896 P.2d 1148.\n\nII. SCOPE AND STANDARD OF BOARD REVIEW.\n\nBoard acts in quasi-judicial capacity in hearing appeals.— In hearing administrative appeals by employees from agency action, as distinguished from its function in adopting rules and creating policy, the state personnel board acts in a quasi-judicial capacity rather than a policy-making function.Montoya v. Dep't of Fin. & Admin., 1982-NMCA-051, 98 N.M. 408, 649 P.2d 476.\n\nBoard may modify agency's action.— The board can find there was employee misconduct and can also determine that the agency's action was inappropriate for the misconduct found by the board. The board may then modify the agency's action, and this includes reinstatement of a dismissed employee.State ex rel. N.M. State Highway Dep't v. Silva, 1982-NMCA-121, 98 N.M. 549, 650 P.2d 833.\n\nDiscrimination claims.— The state personnel board is not authorized to adjudicate statutory disability discrimination claims in administrative just-cause termination proceedings.Martinez v. State Eng'r Office, 2000-NMCA-074, 129 N.M. 413, 9 P.3d 657, cert. denied, 129 N.M. 385, 9 P.3d 68.\n\nJust cause.— The rules adopted by the board limiting the meaning of \"just cause\" to employee conduct does not abridge the authority conferred upon the board by Section 10-9-18(F) NMSA 1978 to determine whether agency action was \"without just cause\".State ex rel. N.M. State Highway Dep't v. Silva, 1982-NMCA-121, 98 N.M. 549, 650 P.2d 833.\n\nIII. APPELLATE REVIEW.\n\nRight to appeal reorganization plan approved by board.— A state employee who was terminated when his position was eliminated because of a lawful reorganization of a department did not have a right to appeal the decision to eliminate his position once the proposed layoff plan had been submitted to the board and the board had given its approval to the plan.Cibas v. N.M. Energy, Minerals & Natural Res. Dep't, 1995-NMCA-046, 120 N.M. 127, 898 P.2d 1265.\n\nProbationer's right to appeal.— Worker who had not completed the probationary period upon reentry into the classified service was not an \"employee\" within the meaning of Section 10-9-3 NMSA 1978 and thus not entitled to appeal rights.Clark v. N.M. Children, Youth & Families Dep't, 1999-NMCA-114, 128 N.M. 18, 988 P.2d 888, cert. denied, 128 N.M. 148, 990 P.2d 822.\n\nAgency appeal will stay reinstatement order.— An appeal by the highway department operates as a stay of an employment reinstatement order.State ex rel. N.M. State Highway Dep't v. Silva, 1982-NMCA-121, 98 N.M. 549, 650 P.2d 833.\n\nBoard not indispensable party on appeal.— The state personnel board is not an indispensable party to an appeal from a final order making an administrative determination as to the employment status of a state employee.Montoya v. Dep't of Fin. & Admin., 1982-NMCA-051, 98 N.M. 408, 649 P.2d 476.\n\nExhaustion of administrative remedies.— Employees, who were discharged by the state department of corrections, could not bypass the administrative procedure after the state personnel board dismissed their appeal in favor of the pursuit of a breach of contract claim in the district court.Barreras v. State Corrs. Dep't, 2003-NMCA-027, 133 N.M. 313, 62 P.3d 770, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 413, 63 P.3d 516.\n\nAppellate review by district court.— The State Personnel Act limits the role of the district court to appellate jurisdiction as opposed to a fact-finding court of general jurisdiction that would ordinarily apply to breach of contract civil actions.Barreras v. State Corrs. Dep't, 2003-NMCA-027, 133 N.M. 313, 62 P.3d 770, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 413, 63 P.3d 516.\n\nScope and standard of review by district court.— In determining whether a decision by the board is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole, the district court, on appeal, will review the evidence in the light most favorable to the board's decision.Jimenez v. Department of Corrs., 1984-NMSC-089, 101 N.M. 795, 689 P.2d 1266.\n\nDistrict court was without power or authority to decide petitioner's dispute over back pay.— Where the department of health (DOH) terminated petitioner from her employment, and where petitioner appealed her termination through arbitration as provided for under the collective bargaining agreement between the state of New Mexico and state employees, and where the arbitrator sustained petitioner's grievance and ordered DOH to reinstate petitioner and awarded petitioner back pay as of the date of her termination until the date of reinstatement, and where petitioner filed a motion to confirm the award as provided for under NMSA 1978, § 44-7A-23, and where the district court entered an order confirming the arbitration award and ordered DOH to reinstate petitioner and ordered back pay in accordance with the arbitration award, and where DOH provided petitioner with back pay, but in doing so deducted the amount of disability and unemployment compensation payments petitioner had received during her period of unemployment, and where petitioner filed a motion in the district court seeking an order compelling DOH to pay her the full amount of back pay without the deductions, and where the district court denied the motion to compel, finding that DOH was entitled to offset petitioner's earnings as permitted by regulation, the district court was without power or authority to decide petitioner's dispute over the back pay amount that she identified in her motion to compel, because the regulation DOH relied on to make the deductions provided that any dispute regarding back pay shall remain with the arbitrator. Because the parties presented the district court with a dispute that the pertinent regulation reserved for the arbitrator to resolve, the district court did not have the power or authority to rule on the dispute.N.M. Dep't of Health v. Maestas, 2023-NMCA-075.\n\nSubstantial evidence.— A reviewing court on appeal must determine whether, on balance, the record as a whole contains substantial evidence to support the hearing officer's finding.Anaya v. N.M. State Personnel Bd., 1988-NMCA-077, 107 N.M. 622, 762 P.2d 909.\n\nArbitrary and capricious.— Unless a statute provides otherwise, municipal personal board decisions are reviewable on the whole record for arbitrariness, capriciousness, fraud or lack of substantial evidence.Zamora v. Village of Ruidoso Downs, 1995-NMSC-072, 120 N.M. 778, 907 P.2d 182.\n\nCourt of appeal's scope of review in reviewing appeals under this articleis the same as that of the district court.Gallegos v. N.M. State Corrs. Dep't, 1992-NMCA-013, 115 N.M. 797, 858 P.2d 1276.\n\nIV. SPECIFIC CASES.\n\nTermination without progressive discipline for intentional misconduct.— Where an employee of the corrections department forcefully struck a stack of coins toward the secretary of corrections and the deputy secretary when the secretary greeted the employee causing the coins to strike the secretary and deputy secretary, and cursed at the secretary and deputy secretary, just cause existed to terminate the employee without first imposing progressive discipline.Selmeczki v. N.M. Dep't of Corrs., 2006-NMCA-024, 139 N.M. 122, 129 P.3d 158.\n\nDismissals from human services department [health care authority department] were in accordance with lawand supported by substantial evidence, which included the failure to promptly report the alleged sexual abuse of a child to the proper authorities.Perkins v. Dep't of Human Servs., 1987-NMCA-148, 106 N.M. 651, 748 P.2d 24.\n\nNo substantial evidence to support dismissal.— There was not substantial evidence in the record to support the agency's findings that a correctional officer witnessed and failed to report the use of force on an inmate, and the board's decision upholding the officer's dismissal was therefore arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law, where the only direct evidence was the employee's own testimony that he did not see another officer pick up an inmate by the neck and there was no evidence whatsoever that contradicted this testimony.Gallegos v. N.M. State Corrs. Dep't, 1992-NMCA-013, 115 N.M. 797, 858 P.2d 1276.\n\nNo just cause for dismissal.— Both the law and the facts supported a hearing officer's finding that charges of continued misconduct and unprofessional behavior including foul language, sexually charged misconduct, and outbursts of anger, did not amount to just cause for dismissal without progressive discipline.N.M. Regulation & Licensing Dep't. v. Lujan, 1999-NMCA-059, 127 N.M. 233, 979 P.2d 744.\n\nDisciplinary action against prison guards upheld.— Substantial evidence supported the hearing officer's conclusion that disciplinary action was properly taken against two prison guards in connection with two inmates' escape where it included evidence from more than one confidential informant that inmates never returned to their cellblock following a class and escaped that night, it was not until two days later that a headcount of that cellblock revealed that two inmates were missing, and the inaccuracy of earlier headcounts was one of the reasons for the disciplinary action.Anaya v. N.M. State Personnel Bd., 1988-NMCA-077, 107 N.M. 622, 762 P.2d 909, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 673, 763 P.2d 689.\n\nAm.

No employer shall dismiss an employee for failure or refusal to pay or promise to pay any assessment, subscription or contribution to any political organization or candidate; however, nothing contained in this section shall prevent voluntary contributions to political organizations.\n\nB. No person in the personnel office or employee in the service shall hold political office except for a non-partisan county or municipal office or be an officer of a political organization during his employment. For the purposes of the Personnel Act, being a local school board member or an elected board member of any post-secondary educational institution shall not be construed to be holding political office, and being an election official shall not be construed to be either holding political office or being an officer of a political organization. Nothing in the Personnel Act shall deny employees the right to vote as they choose or to express their opinions on political subjects and candidates.\n\nC. Any employee who becomes a candidate for public office shall, upon filing or accepting the nomination and during the campaign, take a leave of absence. This subsection does not apply to those employees of a grant-in-aid agency whose political activities are governed by federal statute.\n\nD. The director shall investigate any written charge by any person that this section has been violated and take whatever steps deemed necessary.\n\nE. No person shall be refused the right of taking an examination, from appointment to a position, from promotion or from holding a position because of political or religious opinions or affiliation or because of race or color.\n\nF. No employee or probationer shall engage in partisan political activity while on duty.\n\nG. With respect to employees of federal grant-in-aid agencies, the applicable personnel standards, regulations and federal laws limiting activities shall apply and shall be set forth in rules promulgated by the board.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 5-4-42, enacted by Laws 1961, ch. 240, § 15; 1963, ch. 200, § 6; 1967, ch. 181, § 6; 1983, ch. 81, § 1; 1991, ch. 152, § 1.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective June 14, 1991, inserted \"except for a non-partisan county or municipal office\" in the first sentence in Subsection B.\n\nConstitutionality.— Subsection B does not violate the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech in requiring that certain state employees not hold public office, nor does it deny equal protection by exempting some state employees from its provisions.State ex rel. Gonzales v. Manzagol, 1975-NMSC-002, 87 N.M. 230, 531 P.2d 1203.\n\nLegislative power.— The legislature had the constitutional power under N.M. Const., art. VII, § 2B, to enact this section and to thereby provide, as a qualification or standard for continued employment by the state in a position covered by the State Personnel Act, that the employee not hold \"political office.\"State ex rel. Gonzales v. Manzagol, 1975-NMSC-002, 87 N.M. 230, 531 P.2d 1203.\n\nExample of political office.— The office of city councilman clearly falls within the definition of a \"political office\" and petitioner who held such office could properly be discharged from his classified state job under this section.State ex rel. Gonzales v. Manzagol, 1975-NMSC-002, 87 N.M. 230, 531 P.2d 1203.\n\nScope of prohibition in Subsection B.— The words \"be an officer of a political organization\" are relatively clear. The prohibition (in Subsection B) is without restriction and the legislative intent of these words applies with equal force to the highest and lowest office in a political party or organization. Since there is no restriction, all officers of the party or organization are included within the prohibition, from the state chairman to membership in the central committee or executive committee on down the line to precinct officers and division officers. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-53.\n\nLeave of absence required when running for office.— A state employee may seek election to any county office anywhere in the state if the employee takes a leave of absence from the state job while a candidate and, if elected, the employee resigns from the state job. 1992 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 92-01.\n\nEffect of election to public office.— Under the theory advanced by a Kentucky court, any person who is elected by the voters to a public office would be deemed holding a political office within the intent of Laws 1961, ch. 240, §§ 5 and 15 (10-9-8 NMSA 1978 and this section). This would be so even if the election were conducted along what is commonly known as nonpartisan lines rather than political party lines. The term \"political office\" applies to every elected public office within the state including, but not limited to state elected positions, county elected positions and municipal elected positions, even if conducted along nonpartisan lines. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-53 (rendered prior to 1963 amendment).\n\nEffect of section on municipal election judges or clerks.— Municipal election judges or clerks are not holders of public office under the prohibition of the Personnel Act. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-37.\n\nCandidate for delegate to constitutional convention.— A candidate for the position of delegate to the constitutional convention, which is both a temporary and occasional position, is not a candidate for \"public office\" and need not take a leave of absence. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-28.\n\nEffect on the delegate.— The position of delegate to a constitutional convention is not a \"political office\" within the meaning of Subsection B or C of this section. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-28.\n\nGenerally, as to delegates.— There is no fundamental inconsistency between the positions of public employee covered by the State Personnel Act and that of delegate to the constitutional convention. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-28.\n\nCounty commissioners.— County commissioners may not serve as state employees unless they are from Los Alamos County, currently the only county in the state with nonpartisan offices. County commissioners from Los Alamos may be employed in the state personnel service if the two positions are not incompatible. 1992 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 92-01.\n\nPhrase \"while on duty\"as used in the Personnel Act means to be actually on the job. 1962 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 62-116.\n\nWhen political activity permissible.— A state employee covered by the Personnel Act may engage in political activity while on annual leave, on week-ends and after working hours during the work week. 1962 Op.
