State Bd. of Educ. v. Board of Educ., 1981-NMSC-031, 95 N.M. 588, 624 P.2d 530.\n\nDeputy county assessor.— When salary exceeds $600 per year, appointment of a deputy county assessor without approval of the board of county commissioners is void.State ex rel. Sanchez v. Stapleton, 1944-NMSC-056, 48 N.M. 463, 152 P.2d 877.\n\nConstitutionality.— This law is not unconstitutional by reason of the fact that the title merely states \"An act relating to nepotism.\" 1938 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 38-2030.\n\nLegislative intent.— The legislature intended by this section to apply the civil law rule for determining the degree of relationship and under this method of computation a cousin is not within the third degree, so that a public officer may employ his cousin as a deputy or assistant. 1947 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 47-5040.\n\nStatute normally construed strictly.— Anti-nepotism statutes, being penal in nature, are normally strictly construed. However, no statute may be construed so as to defeat the obvious intent of the legislature. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-08.\n\nSection inapplicable where person hired before relative's election.— This section would not apply to a person employed prior to his relative's election to the hiring authority. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-08.\n\nBrothers are related within the second degree of consanguinity.1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-08.\n\nEmployment where members of family on school district board.— This section does not prohibit employment of a person in a nonteaching, supervisory capacity, although members of his immediate family serve on the board of the school district. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-201.\n\nWhen teacher's spouse on school board.— There is no prohibition against the spouse of a schoolteacher being a member of the school board, but in order to prevent any possible conflict of interest, such school board member should not vote on any issue which affects his or her spouse individually as opposed to affecting all the teachers in the system as a group. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-71.\n\nWhen husband and wife hired.— The New Mexico state racing commission may hire a husband and wife to carry on the duties of the racing commission so long as no such employee is related to the commissioner within the degree of consanguinity prohibited by this section. 1951 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 51-5424.\n\nCounty commissioner's daughter in county department.— The laws on nepotism do not prohibit the employment of a daughter of county commissioner as a stenographer in the county health department of the county where the commissioner serves. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-224.\n\nSheriff's relative as deputy sheriff.— This statute would come into play should a sheriff employ as his guard the regularly employed deputy sheriff since a deputy sheriff would fall within the statutory definition of \"deputy or assistant.\" If such a deputy were related to the sheriff within the prohibited degree it would be a violation of the law. A person temporarily employed as a guard might still be considered an assistant as defined by the statute. However, in the event of temporary employment, it is almost certain that the compensation paid to each assistant would be less than $600 a year, in which case, the prohibition would not apply. Compensation as used here is synonymous with salary and does not include traveling or other incidental expenses usually called per diem. 1961 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 61-09.\n\nSection is not applicable to hiring of state police personnel,but Section 29-2-6 NMSA 1978, pertaining specifically to the state police, is instead controlling. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-114.\n\nProhibited appointments may be approved.— Appointments within the prohibited degree may yet be made if such appointments are approved by a board or officer whose duty it is to approve the bond of the person making the appointment. 1949 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 49-5247.\n\nApproval of district judge's employee.— As district judges are not bonded, there is no entity from which approval of otherwise prohibited employment by the district judge may be obtained. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-25.\n\nEmployment by district judge of his step-daughter, as his secretary, is unlawful.1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-25.\n\nMunicipality's council member is \"elected public official\".— A member of the governing body of a municipality is an \"elected public officer\" for purposes of the statutory prohibition against nepotism. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-08.\n\nBrother of council member employable where council member abstains from voting.— The brother of a member of the governing body of a mayor-council municipality may be employed as an assistant municipal clerk if the council member abstains from voting to approve his brother's employment. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-08.\n\nAssistant clerk of a municipality serves as \"clerk\"to the governing body for purposes of the statutory prohibition against nepotism. 1982 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 82-08.\n\nCourt reporter not clerk, deputy, etc.— An official court reporter is not a clerk, deputy or assistant as those terms are used in this section. 1976 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 76-35.\n\nJanitor is not clerk, etc.— Since a janitor would be neither clerk, deputy or assistant to the employing authority, employment of the wife of one of the school board members by the board would not be prohibited by this section. 1952 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 52-5484.\n\nLevelman is not clerk, etc.— This position of a \"levelman\" in the highway department is not such as would be included within the terminology of \"clerk, deputy, or assistant\" so as to be within that class of employment from which an officer is prohibited from naming any person related by consanguinity or affinity within the third degree. 1951 Op.

The bond shall be executed by a corporate surety company authorized to do business in this state.
