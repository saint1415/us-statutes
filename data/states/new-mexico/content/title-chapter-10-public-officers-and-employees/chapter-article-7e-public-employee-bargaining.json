      "text": "Chapter 10, Article 7E NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Public Employee Bargaining Act\".\n\nHistory:Laws 2003, ch. 4, § 1 and by Laws 2003, ch. 5, § 1; 2005, ch. 333, § 1.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, added the statutory reference to the act.\n\nPunitive damages.— Punitive damages are available in actions for breach of the duty of fair representation where the union's conduct is malicious, willful, wanton, reckless, fraudulent or in bad faith.Akins v. United Steel Workers of Am., 2010-NMSC-031, 148 N.M. 442, 237 P.3d 744,aff'g2009-NMCA-051, 146 N.M. 237, 208 P.3d 457.\n\nWhere after being subjected to overt racism in the workplace, the plaintiff called upon the union to file a grievance and the union refused to do so; the plaintiff was the only African-American working in the plaintiff's department; the plaintiff's coworkers refused to speak English to the plaintiff and the plaintiff's supervisor would only issue orders in Spanish, a language which the plaintiff did not speak; when the plaintiff complained to the defendant's supervisor that the plaintiff could not speak or understand Spanish, the supervisor continued to give orders in Spanish; when the plaintiff asked the union to file a grievance on his behalf, the plaintiff was told by the union president that the plaintiff was of the \"wrong color\" and that the plaintiff needed to learn to speak Spanish, the union's conduct was sufficiently reprehensible to allow the issue of punitive damages to be considered by the jury.Akins v. United Steel Workers of Am., 2009-NMCA-051, 146 N.M. 237, 208 P.3d 457,aff'd,2010-NMSC-031, 148 N.M. 442, 237 P.3d 744.\n\nDuty of fair representation.— Public employee unions owe union members a duty of fair representation. When a complaint arises from a union's representation of employees in a grievance proceeding, the cause of action is for breach of the duty of fair representation, not for breach of a fiduciary duty.Callahan v. N.M. Fed'n of Teachers TVI, 2006-NMSC-010, 139 N.M. 201, 131 P.3d 51.\n\nProof of breach of duty of fair representation.— Breach of the duty of fair representation requires a showing of arbitrary, fraudulent, or bad faith conduct, not a simple showing of negligent representation.Callahan v. N.M. Fed'n of Teachers TVI, 2006-NMSC-010, 139 N.M. 201, 131 P.3d 51.\n\nCovenant of good faith and fair dealing.— Breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is subsumed within claims for breach of duty of fair representation.Callahan v. N.M. Fed'n of Teachers TVI, 2006-NMSC-010, 139 N.M. 201, 131 P.3d 51.\n\nThird-party beneficiary claims.— In order to state a claim against union for breach of collective bargaining agreement as third-party beneficiaries, union members must assert a promise that union made to employer and to union members as third-party beneficiaries, which union subsequently broke.Callahan v. N.M. Fed'n of Teachers TVI, 2006-NMSC-010, 139 N.M. 201, 131 P.3d 51.\n\nExhaustion of administrative remedies.— Because breach of duty of fair representation is not listed as a prohibited practice, union members are not required to bring their claims of breach of the duty of fair representation before the public employees labor relations board or the local labor relations board in order to exhaust their administrative remedies.Callahan v. N.M. Fed'n of Teachers TVI, 2006-NMSC-010, 139 N.M. 201, 131 P.3d 51.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Correcting the Imbalance — The New Mexico Public Employee Bargaining Act and the Statutory Rights Provided to Public Employees\", see 37 N.

Both were compiled as 10-7E-2 NMSA 1978.\n\nConsistency of local ordinance with act's purpose.— City ordinance that allows a public employer to select two members of the three-member local board to adjudicate labor-management disputes does not productively allow employees to collectively bargain, and, as such, violates the purpose of the Public Employee Bargaining Act as stated in Section 10-7E-2 NMSA 1978.City of Deming v.

However, no party may be required, by this provision, to renegotiate the existing terms of collective bargaining agreements already in place.\n\nB. In regard to the Public Employees Retirement Act and the Educational Retirement Act, a public employer in a written collective bargaining agreement may agree to assume any portion of a public employee's contribution obligation to retirement programs provided pursuant to the Public Employees Retirement Act or the Educational Retirement Act.

City of Gallup, 2013-NMCA-053, 302 P.3d 751.\n\nFailure to implement wage increase due to economic considerations.— Where a collective bargaining agreement provided for annual wage increases for the second and third fiscal years of the three year term of the agreement contingent upon city council approval pursuant to the city's labor management relations ordinance; the ordinance provided that in order for a collective bargaining agreement to be approved by the city council, the city council had to approve the economic components of the contract and adopt a resolution providing an appropriation to cover the cost of the contract; because of a revenue shortfall, the city council adopted a budget that did not include funding for wage increases for the third fiscal year as required by the agreement, and the city had sufficient funds to cover the wage increases, the city breached the agreement when it failed to implement the wage increases for the third fiscal year because the city council had appropriated the funding to cover the cost of wage increases for the third fiscal year when it initially approved the agreement pursuant to the ordinance.Albuquerque Police Officers' Ass'n v. City of Albuquerque, 2013-NMCA-110, cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-011.\n\nManagement-rights clause.— A union's waiver of its right to mandatory bargaining under a management-rights clause, which gives management rights not limited by a collective bargaining agreement, will not be inferred unless it is clear and unmistakable that the union was aware of its rights and made the conscious choice to waive its rights.County of Los Alamos v. Martinez, 2011-NMCA-027, 150 N.M. 326, 258 P.3d 118.\n\nWhere the county and the firefighters union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement; the agreement contained a management-rights clause that gave the county certain specific operational and policy rights, as well as all rights not specifically limited by the contract; the county entered into contracts with individual firemen to provide for voluntary paramedic training which specified terms of employment during and after the training program; the paramedic training contracts were not covered by the collective bargaining agreement; and the paramedic training contracts were mandatory subjects of bargaining, the union did not clearly and unmistakably waive its right to bargain for the paramedic training contracts.County of Los Alamos v. Martinez, 2011-NMCA-027, 150 N.M. 326, 258 P.3d 118.\n\n\"Zipper\" clause.— A \"zipper\" clause, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement is the complete and only agreement between the parties on all subjects and that the parties waive the right to bargain with respect to any other matter not specifically referred to in the agreement, is to be given such effect as the bargaining posture, past practices and agreements of the parties indicate.County of Los Alamos v. Martinez, 2011-NMCA-027, 150 N.M. 326, 258 P.3d 118.\n\nWhere the county and the firefighters union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement; the agreement contained a \"zipper\" clause which provided that the agreement was the complete and only agreement between the parties, that all mandatory subjects of collective bargaining had been negotiate, and that each party waived the right to bargain collectively as to any subject not specifically covered by the agreement; the county entered into contracts with individual firemen to provide for voluntary paramedic training which specified terms of employment during and after the training program; the paramedic training contracts were not covered by the collective bargaining agreement; the paramedic training contracts were mandatory subjects of bargaining; and there was no evidence about the bargaining history, expectations of the parties, past practices, or surrounding circumstances of the parties' collective bargaining, the district court did not err in finding that the union did not waive its right to bargain for the paramedic training contracts based on the \"zipper\" clause.County of Los Alamos v. Martinez, 2011-NMCA-027, 150 N.M. 326, 258 P.3d 118.\n\nAn arbitration award that requires a public employer other than the state to expend funds is contingent upon the appropriation and availability of funds.International Assn. of Firefighters v. City of Carlsbad, 2009-NMCA-097, 147 N.M. 6, 216 P.3d 256, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 361, 223 P.3d 358.\n\nArbitration decision contingent upon appropriation of funds.— Where a municipality and a union reached an impasse in their negotiations over wages; the parties entered into an agreement to resolve the impasse by arbitration and selected an arbitrator; the arbitrator entered an arbitration award pursuant to Section 10-7E-18 NMSA 1978 that awarded a wage increase to the union; and the municipality did not appropriate funds to pay the wage increase, the union could not enforce the arbitration award by an action in district court, because under Section 10-7E-17 NMSA 1978, the arbitration award was contingent upon the appropriation and availability of funds.International Assn. of Firefighters v. City of Carlsbad, 2009-NMCA-097, 147 N.M. 6, 216 P.3d 256, cert. denied, 2009-NMCERT-007, 147 N.M. 361, 223 P.3d 358.\n\nArbitration decision did not require the reappropriation of funds.— Where the state and the unions entered into collective bargaining agreements that covered salary increases for union employees in fiscal year 2009; the state determined that the legislature had not appropriated sufficient funds to cover the full salary increases for union employees and implemented salary increases for all employees that differed from those required by the agreements; the arbitrator determined that the Legislature had appropriated sufficient funds to cover the salary increases required by the agreements and that the state's pay package violated the terms of the agreements; and the arbitrator directed the state to adjust the union employee's salary levels for fiscal year 2010 to reflect the level they would have been had the salary increases been provided as required by the agreements, the arbitrator's award did not violate Subsection E of Section 10-7E-17 NMSA 1978.State v. AFSCME Council 18, 2012-NMCA-114, 291 P.3d 600, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-011.\n\nLack of evergreen clause.— Where the municipality and labor unions reached an impasse in negotiations to replace existing collective bargaining agreements; the municipal labor management ordinance did not require that expiring collective bargaining agreements continue in full force and effect until replaced by subsequent agreements; and no municipal appropriation had occurred to extend the agreements and the municipality did not have available funds to fund the economic components of the extension of the agreements, the Public Employee Bargaining Act did not apply to the economic components of the existing agreements because provisions of collective bargaining agreements that require an expenditure of funds are subject to Subsection E of Section 10-7E-17 NMSA 1978, which requires the specific appropriation and availability of funds and the Act did not require the extension of the existing agreements in conflict with Subsection E of Section 10-7E-17 NMSA 1978.AFSCME Council 18 v. City of Albuquerque, 2013-NMCA-012, 293 P.3d 943, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-001.\n\nCollective bargaining procedures were exempt from the evergreen provision.— Where the municipality's labor-management relations ordinance, which was adopted in 1974, included impasse resolution procedures through mediation and arbitration, but did not require that expired collective bargaining agreements remain in effect until successor agreements were reached; when the collective bargaining agreements between the municipality and the unions expired and the parties were unable to agree upon successor agreements, the municipality refused to honor a provision of the expired agreements that required the municipality to compensate union members for union business conducted during municipality work time; and the unions argued that the municipality was required to comply with the evergreen provision of Subsection D of Section 10-7E-18 NMSA 1978 regardless of the grandfather status of the municipality's ordinance, the municipality's collective bargaining procedures were exempt, under Subsection A of Section 10-7E-26 NMSA 1978, from compliance with the evergreen provision.AFSCME Council 18 v. City of Albuquerque, 2013-NMCA-063, 304 P.3d 443, cert. quashed, 2013-NMCERT-009.\n\nAppointment of interim board member by municipality did not violate the grandfather clause requirement.— Where a municipal ordinance required the president of the city council to appoint an interim member of the municipal labor-management relations board when the board met during the absence of a regular board member; the ordinance had been grandfathered under the Public Employee Bargaining Act; the president was an elected city councilor who was elected as president by city council members; and the president did not perform any executive functions, the president did not serve in either a \"management\" or a \"labor\" capacity and the procedure by which the president appointed an interim board member during the absence of a regular board member did not violate the act's grandfather clause requirement that a local ordinance create a system of collective bargaining.City of Albuquerque v. Montoya, 2012-NMSC-007, 274 P.3d 108,rev'g2010-NMCA-100, 148 N.M. 930, 242 P.3d 497.\n\nAppointment of interim board member by municipality.— The grandfather clause does not apply to the provision of a municipal labor-management relations ordinance which provides that if one of the appointed local board members is absent, the president of the city council shall appoint an interim board member from the public at large with due regard to the representative character of the local board because the ordinance did not permit employees to bargain collectively.City of Albuquerque v.

Corrections Dep't v. AFSCME, 2018-NMCA-007, cert. denied.\n\nBoard's decision was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to consider an important aspect of the issue.— Where the communications workers of America filed a prohibited practice complaint against the state of New Mexico, asserting that the state violated the Public Employee Bargaining Act by refusing paid time off for bargaining unit employees for time spent preparing for and participating in grievance meetings and by providing paid union time to union officers and union stewards only, the public employee relations board (board) acted arbitrarily and capriciously in determining that the parties' past practice of granting union time or paid time to bargaining unit employees is as binding as the written provision of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) and was therefore a mandatory subject of bargaining, because the board failed to consider the effect, if any, of the CBA's zipper clause, in which both parties waived the right to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter covered in the CBA.Communication Workers of Am. v. State, 2019-NMCA-031.\n\nWhere the communications workers of America filed a prohibited practice complaint against the state of New Mexico, asserting that the state violated the Public Employee Bargaining Act by refusing paid time off for bargaining unit employees for time spent preparing for and participating in grievance meetings and providing paid union time to union officers and union stewards only, the public employee relations board (board) acted arbitrarily and capriciously in determining that the state did not refuse to bargain collectively in good faith when it gave notice that bargaining unit employees did not have a right to meet with a union officer or steward regarding a grievance on work time, because the board failed to consider whether the state's notice constituted afait accompli, that is, if the notice was too short a time before implementation or because the employer had no intention of altering its plans.Communication Workers of Am. v. State, 2019-NMCA-031.\n\nDismissal of complaint was arbitrary and capricious.— Where educational employees' union alleged that the community college had terminated two employees of the college in retaliation for their union-related activities, the college's alleged violation of the college's labor-management relations resolution gave rise to the union's claims that employees' employment was wrongfully terminated for retaliatory reasons, and where the local labor-management relations board (board) elected to dismiss the union's complaint on the ground that there was no conflict between the collective bargaining agreement's provisions requiring discharge or termination for cause and the employee handbook's provisions permitting non-renewal for no reason, the board's dismissal, being based on a ground not alleged in the union's complaint, was arbitrary and capricious.Northern N.M.
