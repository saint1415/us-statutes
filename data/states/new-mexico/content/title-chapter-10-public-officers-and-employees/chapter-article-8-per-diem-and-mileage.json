Notwithstanding any other specific law to the contrary and except as provided in Subsection I of this section, every nonsalaried public officer shall receive either reimbursement pursuant to the provisions of Subsection K or L of this section or per diem expenses in the following amounts for a board or committee meeting attended; provided that the officer shall not receive per diem expenses for more than one board or committee meeting that occurs on the same day; or for each day spent in discharge of official duties for travel within the state but away from the officer's home:\n\n(1) forty-five dollars ($45.00) if the officer physically attends the board or committee meeting for less than four hours or the officer attends a virtual meeting of any duration during a single calendar day; or\n\n(2) ninety-five dollars ($95.00) if the officer physically attends the board or committee meeting for four hours or more during a single calendar day.\n\nB.

The per diem and mileage or per diem and cost of tickets for common carriers paid to salaried public officers or employees is in lieu of actual expenses for transportation, lodging and subsistence.\n\nF. In addition to the in-state per diem set forth in this section, the department of finance and administration, by rule, may authorize a flat subsistence rate in the amount set by the legislature in the general appropriation act for commissioned officers of the New Mexico state police in accordance with rules promulgated by the department of finance and administration.\n\nG. In lieu of the in-state per diem set in Subsection B of this section, the department of finance and administration may, by rule, authorize a flat monthly subsistence rate for certain employees of the department of transportation, provided that the payments made under this subsection shall not exceed the maximum amount that would be paid under Subsection B of this section.\n\nH.

N.M. State Highway Dep't, 1991-NMCA-093, 113 N.M. 2, 820 P.2d 436.\n\nEnforcement of dropped restriction disallowed.— Where a 35-mile condition is retained only in a per diem clause of a bargaining agreement and it is clear that the parties intended that the 35-mile condition would not apply to a special living allowance provision, the highway department, once it agrees to drop a restriction during negotiations, cannot now be allowed to enforce it.Local 2238 AFSCME v.

Public funds shall be paid out under the Per Diem and Mileage Act only upon vouchers duly presented with any required receipts attached thereto. For employees authorized to receive public funds in advance of travel, payment shall be received only upon vouchers submitted with attached authorization for each travel period. For public officers or employees using authorized credit cards, vouchers with required receipts for each month's travel expenses shall be submitted as a condition to receiving authorization to use the credit card for the next month's travel. Travel expenses may also be advanced if the travel is to be performed under provisions of federal or private contracts and the funds used are not derived from taxes or revenues paid to the state or any of its political subdivisions.\n\nC. The secretary may reduce the rates set for the per diem and mileage for any class of public officials and for employees of state agencies, except public officials of public post-secondary educational institutions, at any time the secretary deems it to be in the public interest, and such reduction shall not be construed to permit payment of any other compensation, perquisite or allowance. The secretary shall exercise this power of reduction in a reasonable manner and shall attempt to achieve a standard rate for all public officers and employees of the same classification. The secretary may, at the request of any state agency and for good cause shown, reduce the rates of per diem and mileage for that state agency. The governing body of any local public body may eliminate or may reduce the rates set for the per diem and mileage for all or any class of public officials and employees of the local public body at any time the local public body deems it to be in the public interest, and such reduction shall not be construed to permit payment of any other compensation, perquisite or allowance. The local public body shall exercise this power of reduction in a reasonable manner and shall attempt to achieve a standard rate for all public officers and employees of the same classification.

The governing board or its designee may reduce the rates set for the per diem and mileage for public officials of public post-secondary educational institutions and for employees of public post-secondary educational institutions at any time the governing board deems it to be in the public interest, and such reduction shall not be construed to permit payment of any other compensation, perquisite or allowance. The governing board shall exercise this power of reduction in a reasonable manner and shall attempt to achieve a standard rate for public officers and employees of public post-secondary educational institutions. The governing board may reduce the rates of per diem and mileage for its public post-secondary educational institution and may, in extraordinary circumstances and in public meeting, allow actual expenses rather than the per diem rates set in the Per Diem and Mileage Act.\n\nE. No reimbursement for out-of-state travel shall be paid to any elected public officer, including any member of the legislature, if after the last day to do so that officer has not filed a declaration of candidacy for reelection to the public officer's currently held office or has been defeated for reelection to the public officer's currently held office in a primary election or any general election.\n\nF.
