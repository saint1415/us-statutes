State, 2007-NMSC-048, 142 N.M. 656, 168 P.3d 1080.\n\nCourt of appeals is court of review only.— Defendant's request to produce evidence in post-conviction proceeding before court of appeals was denied because the court of appeals is a court of review. Such review is limited to matters disclosed by the record, and that court cannot originally determine questions of fact.State v.

N.M. State Hwy. Dep't v. Silva, 1982-NMCA-121, 98 N.M. 549, 650 P.2d 833.\n\nJurisdiction in tort counts.— Although the first count of the complaint is for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief prohibiting the enforcement of portions of a city ordinance, alleging their unconstitutionality, where the second and third counts are for damages for false arrest, a tort action, jurisdiction in the matter is in the court of appeals.Balizer v. Shaver, 1970-NMSC-124, 82 N.M. 53, 475 P.2d 319.\n\nJurisdiction in count for insurer's bad faith in dismissing action.— The vast majority of the cases where judgments in excess of the policy limits have gone against insurance companies for their bad faith in defending or in refusing to settle have been held to be tort actions; thus, for the determination of jurisdiction on appeal, a civil action which includes a count seeking damages for moving to dismiss action against uninsured motorist is one in which one party seeks damages on an issue based on tort.Chacon v. Mountain States Mut. Cas. Co., 1970-NMSC-125, 82 N.M. 54, 475 P.2d 320.\n\nJurisdiction regarding damages for illegal and negligent actions.— Where, among other claims, plaintiffs sought damages on the basis of asserted \"illegal and negligent\" actions on the part of defendants, the court of appeals had subject matter jurisdiction of the appeal, and a motion to transfer was properly denied.Miller v. City of Albuquerque, 1975-NMCA-099, 88 N.M. 324, 540 P.2d 254, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 319, 540 P.2d 248.\n\nJurisdiction in controversy involving uninsured motorist coverage.— Although in one respect an action against an insurer is based on breach of contract, because an action against an insurer is inseparable from a tort action against a tortfeasor where a provision of the insurance policy clearly indicates that the liability of the insurer is contingent upon the liability of a tortfeasor, the court of appeals has jurisdiction of an appeal of an action involving uninsured motorist coverage under this section.Sandoval v. Valdez, 1978-NMCA-016, 91 N.M. 705, 580 P.2d 131, cert. denied, 91 N.M. 610, 577 P.2d 1256.\n\nJurisdiction may arise out of tort counterclaim.— In a suit for reformation where the defendants denied the material allegations of the complaint and counterclaimed for damages as a result of alleged tortious acts on the part of the plaintiffs, the jurisdiction of the court of appeals arises out of the counterclaim based on tort.Wright v. Brem, 1970-NMCA-030, 81 N.M. 410, 467 P.2d 736.\n\nCriminal jurisdiction extends to review of bond order.— Where court of appeals had jurisdiction over an appeal from defendant's conviction of rape but defendant's motion for review of the order fixing appeal bond was originally docketed in the supreme court and then was transferred to the court of appeals, the transfer of that motion was a final determination of jurisdiction.State v. Lucero, 1970-NMCA-057, 81 N.M. 578, 469 P.2d 727.\n\nAppellate jurisdiction over a district court's decision in an on-record appeal from metropolitan court.— The broad language of 34-5-8(A)(3) NMSA 1978 provides the New Mexico court of appeals with subject matter jurisdiction over all criminal cases, except those that result in a life or death sentence, and therefore in the absence of any constitutional or statutory language carving out an exception for on-record appeals, the successive jurisdiction provided for in 34-5-8(A)(3) includes review of both on-record and de novo appeals decided by the district court.State v. Armijo, 2016-NMSC-021,aff'g2014-NMCA-013, 316 P.3d 902.\n\nCriminal jurisdiction extends to review of on-record appellate decisions of the district court.— The court of appeals has been vested with jurisdiction over appeals in all criminal actions, with the limited exception of those where a sentence of death or life imprisonment is imposed, including the review of on-record appellate decisions of the district court.State v. Carroll, 2015-NMCA-033, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of DWI following a bench trial in metropolitan court, appealed the conviction to the district court for on-record review, which was affirmed by the district court, and then appealed the district court's decision to the court of appeals, the state's claim that there is no grant of jurisdiction to the court of appeals from a district court's on-record appellate review of a metropolitan court conviction for DWI was in error; Subsection A(3) of this section grants the court of appeals with jurisdiction to hear appeals from a district court's on-record review of a metropolitan court decision.State v. Carroll, 2015-NMCA-033, cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-001.\n\nConviction of criminal contempt.— Defendant had the right to appeal conviction for criminal contempt, and court of appeals has jurisdiction over that appeal.State v. Watson, 1971-NMCA-104, 82 N.M. 769, 487 P.2d 197.\n\nPrior to 1967, the court of appeals had no jurisdiction in post-conviction remedy proceedings.State v. Weddle, 1967-NMSC-028, 77 N.M. 420, 423 P.2d 611 (holding post-conviction remedy proceedings not \"criminal actions\"); 169 A.L.R. 1203.\n\nThe court of appeals has jurisdiction if proceedings were commenced after effective date of 1967 amendment.State v. Garlick, 1969-NMSC-068, 80 N.M. 352, 456 P.2d 185 (proceedings not commenced before effective date).\n\nIncluding jurisdiction of sentence of not less than one nor more than 99 years.— A sentence of not less than one nor more than 99 years is an indeterminate sentence and not a sentence of life imprisonment; therefore, the court of appeals has jurisdiction of a motion for post-conviction relief.Salazar v. State, 1971-NMCA-076, 82 N.M. 630, 485 P.2d 741.\n\nNo jurisdiction if sentence is death or life imprisonment.— Court of appeals does not have appellate jurisdiction over post-conviction remedy proceedings where the sentence involved is death or life imprisonment.Martinez v. State, 1990-NMCA-033, 110 N.M. 357, 796 P.2d 250.\n\nCourt of appeals has jurisdiction to entertain defendant's probation revocation appeal.State v. Castillo, 1980-NMCA-020, 94 N.M. 352, 610 P.2d 756.\n\nJurisdiction has been given to review director of revenue division.— The court of appeals has jurisdiction to review directly a decision of the director of the revenue division. Section 7-1-25 NMSA 1978 provides that a protestant dissatisfied with the director's order, after a hearing, may appeal directly to that court.Union County Feedlot, Inc. v. Vigil, 1968-NMCA-088, 79 N.M. 684, 448 P.2d 485.\n\nNo jurisdiction to review personnel board or former alcoholism commission.— It has not been provided by law for the court of appeals to review the decision of the personnel board or the alcoholism commission (now abolished). The remedy for review of the administrative actions in such case is by a writ of certiorari from the district court.Durand v. N.M. Comm'n on Alcoholism, 1976-NMCA-077, 89 N.M. 434, 553 P.2d 714.\n\nOrder by director of workers' compensation administrationis not appealable to the court of appeals.Sun Country Physical Therapy Assocs. v. N.M. Self-Insurers' Fund, 1996-NMCA-008, 121 N.M. 248, 910 P.2d 324.\n\nStandards adopted by agency as rules appealable.— Since the standards for the evaluation of waste water to determine whether it is contaminated were adopted by an administrative agency as rules, they are appealable to the court of appeals.Bokum Resources Corp. v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm'n, 1979-NMSC-090, 93 N.M. 546, 603 P.2d 285.\n\nCourt of appeals has no jurisdiction to review discharge of writ of prohibition.— Appellants' claim in prohibition proceedings that a nonattorney police court judge was not constitutionally qualified to hear their criminal cases arising from violations of municipal ordinances was properly taken directly from the district court to the supreme court. The appeal did not fall within the ambit of this section.Tsiosdia v. Rainaldi, 1976-NMSC-011, 89 N.M. 70, 547 P.2d 553.\n\nSupreme court precedents must be followed.— The court of appeals is to follow precedents of the supreme court; it is not free to abolish instructions approved by the supreme court, although in appropriate situations it may consider whether the supreme court precedent is applicable.State v. Scott, 1977-NMCA-024, 90 N.M. 256, 561 P.2d 1349, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 637, 567 P.2d 486,overruled on other grounds byState v. Reynolds, 1982-NMSC-091, 98 N.M. 527, 650 P.2d 811.\n\nOrder approving criminal instructions.— The court of appeals is bound by the supreme court order approving N.M.U.J.I. Crim. 2.10 and 2.20 (now see UJI 14-210 and 14-220) and has no authority to set the instructions aside.State v.

      "text": "A. The appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court is coextensive with the state and extends to all cases where appellate jurisdiction is not specifically vested by law in the court of appeals.\n\nB. In addition to its original appellate jurisdiction, the supreme court has jurisdiction to review by writ of certiorari to the court of appeals any civil or criminal matter in which the decision of the court of appeals:\n\n(1) is in conflict with a decision of the supreme court;\n\n(2) is in conflict with a decision of the court of appeals;\n\n(3) involves a significant question of law under the constitution of New Mexico or the United States; or\n\n(4) involves an issue of substantial public interest that should be determined by the supreme court.\n\nApplication to the supreme court for writ of certiorari to the court of appeals shall be filed with the clerk of the supreme court within twenty days after final action by the court of appeals. A copy of the application shall be filed by the clerk of the supreme court with the clerk of the court of appeals and the clerk of the court of appeals shall forthwith transmit the record in the case to the clerk of the supreme court. Upon filing of the application, the judgment and mandate of the court of appeals shall be stayed pending final action of the supreme court. No further briefs or oral argument in support of an application for writ of certiorari shall be filed or had in the supreme court unless so directed by the supreme court. If an application has not been acted upon within thirty days, it shall be deemed denied.\n\nC. The supreme court has appellate jurisdiction in matters appealed to the court of appeals, but undecided by that court, if the court of appeals certifies to the supreme court that the matter involves:\n\n(1) a significant question of law under the constitution of New Mexico or the United States; or\n\n(2) an issue of substantial public interest that should be determined by the supreme court.\n\nAny certification by the court of appeals under this subsection is a final determination of appellate jurisdiction.\n\nD. The jurisdiction of the supreme court over the decisions of the court of appeals and over actions certified to it by the court of appeals is in addition to the jurisdiction of the supreme court in the issuance and determination of original writs directed to the court of appeals.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 16-7-14, enacted by Laws 1966, ch. 28, § 14; 1972, ch. 71, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act,see39-7-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor appellate jurisdiction of supreme court,seeN.M.

VI, § 29 and 34-5-8 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor procedure on certiorari to review decision of court of appeals,see12-502 NMRA.\n\nFor procedure on certification from court of appeals,see12-606 NMRA.\n\nSignificant question of constitutional law.— Where defendant alleged in his petition for a writ of certiorari that the state violated his rights as provided under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United State Constitution, and Article II, Section 14 of the New Mexico Constitution, the state supreme court had jurisdiction to review defendant's case by writ of certiorari because it involves a significant question of law under the constitution of New Mexico or the United States.State v. Urban, 2004-NMSC-007, 135 N.M. 279, 87 P.3d 1061.\n\nEstablishing propriety of writ.— Neither Rule 12-502 NMRA nor this section would require a defendant to establish the propriety of the writ of certiorari in his brief in chief.State v. Urban, 2004-NMSC-007, 135 N.M. 279, 87 P.3d 1061.\n\nSupreme court has appellate jurisdiction not given court of appeals.— The appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court \"extends to all cases where appellate jurisdiction is not specifically vested by law in the court of appeals.\"State v. Weddle, 1967-NMSC-028, 77 N.M. 420, 423 P.2d 611.\n\nDirect appeal to supreme court.— Appellants' claim in prohibition proceedings that a nonattorney police court judge was not constitutionally qualified to hear their criminal cases arising from violations of municipal ordinances was properly taken directly from the district court to the supreme court; the appeal did not fall within the ambit of 16-7-8 NMSA 1978 (now Section 34-5-8 NMSA 1978).Tsiosdia v. Rainaldi, 1976-NMSC-011, 89 N.M. 70, 547 P.2d 553.\n\nOnly supreme court may reverse its own precedent.— Implicit in this section is the concept that the court of appeals is to be governed by the precedents of the supreme court, and although the supreme court, by abolishing the defense of unavoidable accident in negligence actions, affirmed the decision of the court of appeals, which had taken that same action, the supreme court made clear that it, not the court of appeals, had authority to reverse its own precedent.Alexander v. Delgado, 1973-NMSC-030, 84 N.M. 717, 507 P.2d 778.\n\nCertification of issues to the supreme court.— The court of appeals should certify an issue when it appears that New Mexico supreme court precedent directly controls that issue and is contrary to later United States supreme court precedent, and, in certifications brought under NMSA 1978, § 34-5-14(C), the New Mexico supreme court accepts certification of issues, rather than cases.State v. Mares, 2024-NMSC-002,overruling State v. Desnoyers, 2002-NMSC-031, 132 N.M. 756, 55 P.3d 968, andabrogating Collins ex rel. Collins v. Tabet, 1991-NMSC-013, 111 N.M. 391, 806 P.2d 40, andRhein v. ADT Auto., 1996-NMSC-066, 122 N.M. 646, 930 P.2d 783.\n\nThe court of appeals is bound to follow supreme court precedent.— When the New Mexico supreme court has directly ruled on an issue in a manner that would be dispositive in the case at bar, the court of appeals must apply that same rule to the case at bar. The court of appeals has the authority to depart from New Mexico supreme court precedent if the precedent does not directly control the issue in the case at bar. A precedential case is directly controlling if it compels the outcome of the issue in the current case.State v. Mares, 2024-NMSC-002,overruling State v. Desnoyers, 2002-NMSC-031, 132 N.M. 756, 55 P.3d 968, andabrogating Collins ex rel. Collins v. Tabet, 1991-NMSC-013, 111 N.M. 391, 806 P.2d 40, andRhein v. ADT Auto., 1996-NMSC-066, 122 N.M. 646, 930 P.2d 783.\n\nAppeals and writs of error are in no sense to be compared to certiorari,and the presence of the right to appeal makes inappropriate and unavailable the right to certiorari.Roberson v. Board of Educ., 1967-NMSC-176, 78 N.M. 297, 430 P.2d 868.\n\nLimitation on right of appeal does not extend to certiorari.— There is no reason to assume that the legislature, in limiting the state's right to appeal in a criminal case, intended a like limitation in the granting of a writ of certiorari. On the contrary, this section indicates that these remedies are to be considered separately.State v. Gunzelman, 1973-NMSC-055, 85 N.M. 295, 512 P.2d 55,overruled on other grounds byState v. Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, 113 N.M. 780, 833 P.2d 1146.\n\nCertiorari may be issued in criminal cases.— The supreme court has the authority to issue writs of certiorari directed to the court of appeals in a criminal case where the conditions of this section are met, and the court's original jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari, as provided for in N.M. Const., art. VI, § 3, leaves no doubt as to the power of the court to issue such writs.State v. Gunzelman, 1973-NMSC-055, 85 N.M. 295, 512 P.2d 55,overruled on other grounds byState v. Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, 113 N.M. 780, 833 P.2d 1146.\n\nClaim of prosecutorial misconduct.— The supreme court had jurisdiction by writ of certiorari to review defendant's claim he was denied a fair trial because of prosecutorial misconduct.State v. Ashley, 1997-NMSC-049, 124 N.M. 1, 946 P.2d 205.\n\nState may seek writ of certiorari.— Although the reason for granting the writ of certiorari petitioned for by the state is based upon this section, it should be noted that N.M. Const., art. VI, § 3, in addition to the authority of N.M. Const., art. VI, § 2, and this section, states that this court \"shall have a superintending control over all inferior courts; it shall also have power to issue writs of . . . certiorari . . . and all other writs necessary or proper for the complete exercise of its jurisdiction and to hear and determine the same.\"State v. Gunzelman, 1973-NMSC-055, 85 N.M. 295, 512 P.2d 55,overruled on other grounds byState v. Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, 113 N.M. 780, 833 P.2d 1146.\n\nRulings held not to raise issues of substantial public interest.— Rulings of the court of appeals concerning statements by district attorney in closing argument held not to raise issues of substantial public interest which should be determined by the supreme court under Paragraph B(4).Deats v. State, 1969-NMSC-029, 80 N.M. 77, 451 P.2d 981.\n\nDenial of certiorari not affirmance or precedent.— The denial of a petition for writ of certiorari by the court of last resort to review a decision of a court of intermediate appeal is not regarded as an affirmance of such decision which raises it to the dignity of final authority. The denial cannot be utilized as precedent or authority for or against the propositions urged or defended in such proceedings, nor can it be urged as approval of the rule announced in the court of intermediate appeal.State v. Cutnose, 1975-NMCA-021, 87 N.M. 300, 532 P.2d 889,overruled on other grounds byState v. McCormack, 1984-NMSC-006, 100 N.M. 657, 674 P.2d 1117.\n\nWrit of certiorari not properly granted.— Jurisdiction by writ of certiorari was not appropriate since the issue in the case only involved a difference of opinion between the district court and the court of appeals and none of the conditions in Subsection B of this section were present.State v. Conn, 1993-NMSC-004, 115 N.M. 99, 847 P.2d 744.\n\nApplicability of Subsection C.— Subsection C extends to \"matters appealed to the court of appeals, but undecided by that court,\" if the court makes the requisite certification. The word \"matter\" means the entire case in which the appeal is taken.Collins ex rel. Collins v. Tabet, 1991-NMSC-013, 111 N.M. 391, 806 P.2d 40,abrogated by State v Mares, 2024-NMSC-002.\n\nCases certified where two court of appeals judges concurred but on different grounds.— Where there are three separate opinions of the court of appeals, the first of which would affirm the conviction of defendant on all counts, the second and third of which would reverse and remand for a new trial on two different issues, and it appears that the three proposed opinions, if filed as opinions of the court of appeals, would create uncertainty in the law in that, although there is a majority for reversal, there is no guidance for the future procedure of the case, and it further appears that the court of appeals may not call in additional judges, and, because an uncertain state of law should not exist and because of this fact an issue of substantial public interest is created and should be determined by the supreme court, the case is properly certified to the New Mexico supreme court for decision.State v. Tijerina, 1972-NMCA-169, 84 N.M. 432, 504 P.2d 642;State v. Tijerina, 1973-NMSC-105, 86 N.M. 31, 519 P.2d 127, cert. denied, 417 U.S. 956, 94 S. Ct. 3085, 41 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1974).\n\nInstructions on intent in criminal cases.— The matter of instructions concerning the requisite intent in criminal cases is one of substantial public interest that should be decided by the New Mexico supreme court.State v. Boyer, 1973-NMCA-047, 84 N.M. 759, 508 P.2d 29;State v. Vickery, 1973-NMCA-046, 84 N.M. 758, 508 P.2d 28;State v. Fuentes, 1973-NMCA-045, 84 N.M. 757, 508 P.2d 27;State v. Puga, 1973-NMCA-044, 84 N.M. 756, 508 P.2d 26.\n\nInterlocutory appeal granted to consider contributory negligence doctrine.— The supreme court granted an interlocutory appeal from the court of appeals pursuant to this section to determine the current validity of contributory negligence in New Mexico law.Syroid v. Albuquerque Gravel Prods. Co., 1974-NMSC-039, 86 N.M. 235, 522 P.2d 570.\n\nDelay alone insufficient ground for certification.— Delay by the court of appeals in deciding an appeal of a decision holding a statutory act unconstitutional was an insufficient ground for certification to the supreme court, where the delay occurred because primary consideration was given to priority cases and there was no showing that the assigned panel lacked authority to decide the issue, was unable to decide it, or felt it should not decide the issue because it was before the supreme court in other cases.Deer Mesa Corp. v. Los Tres Valles Special Zoning Dist. Comm'n, 1985-NMCA-114, 103 N.M. 675, 712 P.2d 21.\n\nMinimum procedural requirements must be met.— Even where applications or petitions are required by statute which also provides for liberal interpretation, certain minimum requirements must be met.Roberson v. Board of Educ., 1967-NMSC-176, 78 N.M. 297, 430 P.2d 868.\n\nCourt of appeals cannot review extensions of time after certification.— The court of appeals is without authority to review supreme court orders granting extensions of time to commence trial, where defendant's cause, challenging the validity of the supreme court's ex parte order granting the state an extension of time in which to try defendant, was certified to that court.State v. Carter, 1974-NMCA-141, 87 N.M. 41, 528 P.2d 1281.\n\nSubstantial public interest.— The certified question of whether New Mexico should adopt the rule adopted in Arizona that, as a matter of law and public policy, the attractive nuisance doctrine should not be extended to flumes and irrigation ditches is an issue of substantial public interest.Carmona v. Hagerman Irrigation Co., 1998-NMSC-007, 125 N.M. 59, 957 P.2d 44.\n\nThe application of the venue provisions of 38-3-1 NMSA 1978 to a national banking association presented an issue of \"substantial public interest\" so as to justify certification under Subsection C(2).Sunwest Bank v. Nelson, 1998-NMSC-012, 125 N.M. 170, 958 P.2d 740.\n\nSupreme court had jurisdiction to hear appeal from the court of appeals' denial of municipal judge's Writ of Superintendent Control brought against a presiding judge who voided his DWI sentences; the question was one of \"substantial public interest\" and, therefore, properly before the supreme court under this section.Sims v. Ryan, 1998-NMSC-019, 125 N.M. 357, 961 P.2d 782.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Approaching Statutory Interpretation in New Mexico,\" see 8 Nat.
