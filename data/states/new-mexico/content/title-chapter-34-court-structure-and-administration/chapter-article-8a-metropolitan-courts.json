Yontz, 1986-NMSC-034, 104 N.M. 265, 720 P.2d 300.\n\nProhibition against private practice of law constitutionally permissible.— A lawyer is constitutionally denied the privilege of engaging in the private practice of law while serving as a small claims court judge. In prohibiting a small claims court judge from practicing law while in office, the legislature is attaching a lawful condition to the holding of the office. This in no way interferes with the class of persons who are eligible to be chosen to hold public office as prescribed by N.M. Const., art. VII, § 2. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen.

With respect to civil actions, except for contempt of the metropolitan court, the right to trial by jury exists in all actions in the metropolitan court which are within metropolitan court jurisdiction.

If demand is not made pursuant to this subsection, or if the jury fee is not paid at the time demand is made, trial by jury is deemed waived.\n\nB. With respect to criminal actions:\n\n(1) if the penalty does not exceed ninety days' imprisonment or if the penalty is a fine or forfeiture of a license, the action shall be tried by the judge without a jury;\n\n(2) if the penalty exceeds ninety days' but does not exceed six months' imprisonment, either party to the action may demand a trial by jury. The demand shall be made orally or in writing to the court at or before the time of entering a plea or in writing to the court within ten days after the time of entering a plea. If demand is not made pursuant to this subsection, trial by jury is deemed waived; or\n\n(3) if the penalty exceeds six months' imprisonment, the case shall be tried by jury unless the defendant waives a jury trial with the approval of the court and the consent of the state.\n\nC. Juries in the metropolitan court shall hear the evidence in the action which shall be delivered in public in its presence. After hearing the evidence and being duly charged by the judge, the members of the jury shall be kept together until:\n\n(1) in civil actions, five members shall agree upon a verdict;\n\n(2) in criminal actions, the members unanimously agree upon a verdict; or\n\n(3) the members are discharged by the judge.\n\nThe judge shall give judgment upon any verdict.\n\nD. A jury in the metropolitan court consists of six jurors with the same qualifications as jurors in the district court.\n\nE. The presiding judge of the metropolitan court shall direct the clerk of the district court to draw and assign to that court the number of qualified jurors the judge deems necessary for one or more jury panels. Upon the receipt of the direction and in the manner prescribed for the selection of district court jurors, the clerk of the district court shall draw at random from the master jury wheel the number of qualified jurors specified.

Whenever a jury is required, the presiding judge of the metropolitan court shall order the sheriff or a responsible person to summon the persons named on the jury list to appear at the time and place set for trial of the action. If a jury is left incomplete because of failure of jurors to appear, excused absences or disqualification of jurors, a metropolitan judge shall direct the sheriff to summon others to complete the jury.\n\nG.

The rules shall provide simple procedures for the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of any metropolitan court action.\n\nB. Other than for actions brought pursuant to the Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act [47-8-1 to 47-8-52 NMSA 1978], the metropolitan court is a court of record for civil actions. Any party aggrieved by a judgment rendered by the metropolitan court in a civil action may appeal to the court of appeals. The manner and method for the appeal shall be set forth by supreme court rule.\n\nC. The metropolitan court is not a court of record for civil actions brought pursuant to the Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act.

The appeal shall be de novo.\n\nD. The metropolitan court is a court of record for criminal actions involving driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs or involving domestic violence. A criminal action involving domestic violence means an assault or battery under any state law or municipal or county ordinance in which the alleged victim is a household member as defined in the Family Violence Protection Act [Chapter 40, Article 13 NMSA 1978]. Any party aggrieved by a judgment rendered by the metropolitan court in a criminal action involving driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs or involving domestic violence may appeal to the court of appeals. The manner and method of appeal shall be set forth by supreme court rule.\n\nE. The metropolitan court is not a court of record for criminal actions other than driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs or domestic violence actions. Any party aggrieved by a judgment rendered by the metropolitan court in a criminal action, other than driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs or domestic violence action, may appeal to the district court of the county in which the metropolitan court is located within fifteen days after the judgment was rendered.

Lizzol, 2007-NMSC-024, 141 N.M. 705, 160 P.3d 886.\n\nReview of domestic violence actions.— Where the judgment of the metropolitan court does not include a statement indicating that a conviction results from the commission of domestic abuse, the metropolitan court has implicitly concluded that the conviction was not based on the commission of domestic abuse. This ruling by the metropolitan court, whether explicit or implied, is subject to review by the district court. The district court should therefore review the metropolitan court's factual conclusions with some deference, considering whether they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. The metropolitan court's application of law to these facts, however, is properly reviewed de novo.State v. Wilson, 2006-NMSC-037, 140 N.M 218, 141 P.3d 1271.\n\nA defendant may not attack the validity of a metropolitan court pleafor the first time in an on-the-record appeal to the district court.State v.

Spillman, 2010-NMCA-019, 147 N.M. 676, 227 P.3d 1058, cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-001, 147 N.M. 673, 227 P.3d 1055.\n\nNo appeal will lie from anything other than an actual written order or judgmentsigned by a judge and filed with the clerk of the court.State v. Lohberger, 2008-NMSC-033, 144 N.M. 297, 187 P.3d 162.\n\nRule 3-708 NMRA is invalid to the extent it conditions the creation of a record on a party's request.— Where plaintiff filed a petition in the metropolitan court under the Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act, 47-8-1 to 47-8-52 NMSA 1978, requesting restitution of a single-family home, and where, after trial, the metropolitan court entered a judgment restoring the home to plaintiff and evicting defendant, and where defendant appealed the metropolitan court's judgment to the district court, which dismissed the appeal because defendant had failed to request a recording of the metropolitan court's trial in compliance with 3-708(A) NMRA, the district court erred in dismissing the appeal, because at the relevant time of this appeal, 34-8A-6 NMSA 1978, imposed a duty on the metropolitan court to create a record of its civil proceedings sufficient to permit appellate review, and 3-708(A) NMRA and other similar rules, which condition the metropolitan court's act of recordation on a party's request, stand in direct conflict with the record-keeping mandate of 34-8A-6(B) NMSA 1978.Padilla v. Torres, 2024-NMSC-007.\n\nOn-record trial of domestic abuse.— All acts of domestic abuse as defined in 40-13-2 NMSA 1978 of the Family Violence Protection Act should be tried on-record in metropolitan court.State ex rel. Schwartz v. Sanchez, 1997-NMSC-021, 123 N.M. 165, 936 P.2d 334.\n\nSexual assault convictions, whether the victim and defendant are household members or not, are entitled to on-record appeals in the district court.— Criminal sexual contact is sexual assault as the term is used in the Family Violence Protection Act (FVPA), 40-13-1 through 40-13-12 NMSA 1978, and is thus an act of domestic abuse as defined by the FVPA whether committed by a household member or not, and therefore a person convicted of criminal sexual contact against a non-household member in the metropolitan court is entitled to an on-record appeal in the district court pursuant to 34-8A-6(D) NMSA 1978.State v. Gonzales, 2017-NMCA-080, cert. denied.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted of criminal sexual contact against a non-household member, an act of domestic abuse as defined by the Family Violence Protection Act, 40-13-1 through 40-13-12 NMSA 1978, in the metropolitan court, he was not entitled to a de novo appeal, but was only entitled to an on-record review in the district court pursuant to 34-8A-6(D) NMSA 1978.State v. Gonzales, 2017-NMCA-080, cert. denied.\n\nSubsection C does not unconstitutionally abridge right of appealguaranteed by N.M. Const. art. VI, § 27.State v. Ball, 1986-NMSC-030, 104 N.M. 176, 718 P.2d 686.\n\nDirect appeals to the New Mexico court of appeals must be from final judgments.— Where defendant was charged with driving under the influence and improper use of registration, and where defendant's bench trial ended prematurely when the court declared a mistrial after the prosecutor revealed to the court the results of defendant's breath alcohol test prior to their admission into evidence, and where defendant subsequently filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that his right to be free from double jeopardy would be violated by a second trial because there was no manifest necessity for a mistrial and that mistrial was caused by prosecutorial misconduct, and where, following the denial of his motion to dismiss, defendant filed an application for interlocutory appeal to the New Mexico court of appeals, defendant's appeal was dismissed, because there is no statutory authority that provides a defendant with the right to immediately appeal to the New Mexico court of appeals from metropolitan court orders denying motions to dismiss after mistrial.State v. Calderon, 2024-NMCA-005, cert. denied.\n\n\"Aggrieved\" party for purposes of appeal.— A defendant who properly has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere in metropolitan court is not an \"aggrieved\" party entitled, under Subsection C, to appeal to the district court for a trial de novo.State v. Ball, 1986-NMSC-030, 104 N.M. 176, 718 P.2d 686.\n\nAlthough defendant stipulated to all the essential elements of the crime with which he was charged without reservation, the court declined to hold that the defendant was not an aggrieved party and therefore had no right to appeal; defendant's stipulation as to the essential elements of the crime is not the functional equivalent of a guilty or no contest plea where there is no showing that when defendant made his stipulations he understood that such action amounted to a guilty or no contest plea and that he would forego his right to appeal to the district court for a trial de novo.State v. Romero, 1992-NMCA-070, 114 N.M. 320, 838 P.2d 474.\n\nOne who agrees not to be aggrievedby entering into a plea and disposition agreement in the metropolitan court, who alleges no constitutional invalidity in the agreement, and who does not seek to have the plea and agreement withdrawn, is not an \"aggrieved\" party and cannot appeal to the district court.State v. Bazan, 1982-NMCA-018, 97 N.M. 531, 641 P.2d 1078, cert. denied, 98 N.M. 50, 644 P.2d 1039,overruled on other grounds byState v. Ball, 1986-NMSC-030, 104 N.M. 176, 718 P.2d 686.\n\nAppeal governed by nature of offense.— Appeal from the metropolitan court is governed by the crime of which defendants are convicted rather than the type of trial, thus, defendant convicted of eluding an officer and reckless driving was entitled to a trial de novo, even though the trial was on the record.State v. Krause, 1998-NMCA-013, 124 N.M. 415, 951 P.2d 1076, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 146, 958 P.2d 104.\n\nWhere defendant was convicted in metropolitan court of battery against a household member in violation of 30-3-4 NMSA 1978, because the state did not prosecute the battery under 30-3-15 NMSA 1978, state could not contend, under Subsection D of this section, that defendant was convicted of a crime involving domestic violence; defendant was, thus, entitled to a de novo appeal in district court rather than just an on-record review of the proceeding.State v. Trujillo, 1999-NMCA-003, 126 N.M. 603, 973 P.2d 855.\n\nProsecution is not a \"person\" within the meaning of Subsection C.State v. Giraudo, 1983-NMCA-042, 99 N.M. 634, 661 P.2d 1333 (decided under prior law).\n\nLimited authority to impose jail time on appeal.— In a criminal trial de novo, on appeal from the metropolitan court, the district court lacks the authority to impose jail time greater than the jail time imposed by the metropolitan court.State v. Haar, 1983-NMCA-140, 100 N.M. 609, 673 P.2d 1342.\n\nNo change in sentence allowed in de novo trial upon an appeal.— In a de novo trial upon an appeal from a metropolitan court, there is no statutory authority empowering the district court to impose a lesser or greater penalty than that imposed by the metropolitan court.State v. Lyon, 1985-NMCA-082, 103 N.M. 305, 706 P.2d 516, cert. denied, 103 N.M. 287, 705 P.2d 1138.\n\nState can reduce charge in de novo trial even though effect is to avoid jury trial.— At a trial de novo on an appeal of a metropolitan court jury conviction, the state may reduce the charge against the defendant with the effect that the defendant would not be exposed to a term of confinement which would require a jury trial.State v. Lyon, 1985-NMCA-082, 103 N.M. 305, 706 P.2d 516, cert. denied, 103 N.M. 287, 705 P.2d 1138.\n\nStandard of review to be applied by district court in a civil appealfrom the metropolitan court to the district court is one of \"substantial evidence\" to support the finding of the metropolitan court.Johnson v. Southwestern Catering Corp., 1983-NMCA-020, 99 N.M. 564, 661 P.2d 56.\n\nExtent of retention of jurisdiction by district court.— A district court may retain jurisdiction of an action filed in the former small claims court to the same extent as if originally filed in the district court. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-168 (opinion rendered under former law).\n\nLiability for district court docket fee upon transfer.— A party instituting an action or causing it to be docketed in the former small claims court must pay the district court docket fee on transfer to the district court under certain circumstances. 1963 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 63-168 (opinion rendered under former law).\n\nLaw reviews.— For annual survey of New Mexico law relating to criminal procedure, see 12 N.M.L. Rev. 271 (1982).",
