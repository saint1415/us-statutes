      "text": "The district court shall always be in session. At least two regular terms for each county within a judicial district shall be established by court rule. When for any reason a district judge is prevented from attending a regular term of the district court on the first day, he may, at any time during that term, enter an order fixing another return day for all process, bonds and recognizances returnable at that term. The order fixing the return day shall be filed with the district court clerk, who shall post a copy at the courthouse for at least ten days before the return day. Juries shall be empanelled [empaneled], cases shall be set and tried and all other business of the district court shall be conducted in any county at any time as directed by the district judge.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 16-3-2, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 69, § 5.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For terms of district courts,seeN.M. Const., art. VI, § 13.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1961, ch. 188, § 5, repealed former 16-3-2, 1953 Comp., relating to number of judges in first judicial district divisions, and enacted another 16-3-2, 1953 Comp., dealing with the same subject matter. Laws 1968, ch. 69, § 69, repeals 16-3-2, 1953 Comp., and the above section was enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 69, § 5.\n\n\"Sessions\" of court include onlythat time during which a court actually conducts business. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 79-04.\n\nDetermination at arraignment is determination of court.— The determination by the judge at arraignment that defendant was not entitled to court-appointed counsel was a determination of the court. In this case, it was the court of the first judicial district. The trial judge who presided carried out judicial duties as the court of the district. There is only one court. It was the court that inquired into defendant's indigency. If defendant wished the court to reconsider the matter, he should have brought it to the attention of the court.State v. Anaya, 1966-NMSC-144, 76 N.M. 572, 417 P.2d 58.\n\nTrial cannot be conducted between terms.— Terms of courts for the several counties having been provided by statute for the trial of causes, the trial court, in the intervals between those terms, was, for the purpose of conducting trials, no longer a court.Staab v. Atl. & Pac. R.R. Co., 1886-NMSC-015, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 606, 9 P. 381.\n\nArranging nonjury trials.— Under former statute, no fixed terms were set for nonjury trials but they were arranged through court order and proper notice in adversary proceedings.Peisker v. Chavez, 1942-NMSC-004, 46 N.M. 159, 123 P.2d 726.\n\nAuthorizing vacation hearings on motions does not authorize final judgment.— Terms of statute permitting judge to hear and determine motions in vacation could not be extended so as to authorize a decision in vacation in actions at law which amounts to final judgment in the case, or any branch of it, from which, if rendered in term, an appeal would lie, even though the parties should consent thereto.Colter v. Marriage, 1886-NMSC-014, 3 N.M. (Gild.) 604, 9 P. 383.\n\nVacation decrees proper where court is always in session.— Since Comp. Laws 1884, § 1829, declared that the district courts should be in session at all times, with authority to render final decrees in equity, no action of the court at a regular term was required to give validity to decrees rendered in vacation.United States v. Gwyn, 1888-NMSC-012, 4 N.M. (Gild.) 635, 42 P. 167.\n\nProceedings at unauthorized term void.— Where proceedings were tried at term not authorized by statute, they were coram non judice and void.Bumpers v. Wallace, 1952-NMSC-056, 56 N.M. 462, 245 P.2d 383.\n\nUnder former statute, if a term of court had failed for any cause, a special term might be called, but where a criminal conviction was had at a term not authorized by law, the proceedings were coram non judice and the judgment was void.State v. Montiel, 1952-NMSC-028, 56 N.M. 181, 241 P.2d 844.\n\nIf term authorized, conviction not subject to attack.— Under former statute, court rightly refused to sustain motion in arrest of judgment on asserted ground that term of court in which defendant was tried and convicted was a special term, that the special term was unauthorized by law and that the proceedings of the term were coram non judice.Territory v. Hicks, 1892-NMSC-024, 6 N.M. 596, 30 P. 872,overruled on other grounds byHaynes v. United States, 1899-NMSC-003, 9 N.M. 519, 56 P. 282.\n\nSentencing may be postponed to later term.— Under former statute relating to special terms, postponement of a sentence from a special term at which a verdict of guilty was rendered to a regular term two weeks later, at defendant's request, did not render the proceedings void for want of jurisdiction.Gonzales v. Cunningham, 164 U.S. 612, 17 S. Ct. 182, 41 L. Ed. 572 (1896).\n\nDuration of term.— A term of a district court, begun and held by any judge, continues its existence until the legal day for beginning another term, unless sooner adjourned, although another term of the same court for another county has been held, as required by law, in the meantime, by the same judge.Territory v. Barela, 1910-NMSC-042, 15 N.M. 520, 110 P. 845;Territory ex rel. Hubbell v. Armijo, 1907-NMSC-013, 14 N.M. 205, 89 P. 267.\n\nDiscretion to continue term.— Compiled Laws 1884, § 543, which directed courts to be held in the different counties at the times fixed by law and authorized their continuance until adjourned by order of court, imposed a duty and conferred a discretion which should prevail if exercise of discretion rendered the discharge of the duty impracticable.Borrego v. Territory, 1896-NMSC-011, 8 N.M. 446, 46 P. 349.\n\nFormer section, providing that special terms should not conflict with regular terms, merely declared against a conflict and did not declare the cessation or illegality of the proceedings of the seemingly conflicting special term; under the statute, length of special term was as absolutely in the control of the presiding judge as regular terms are without any condition or restrictions as to duration in furtherance of justice.Borrego v. Territory, 1896-NMSC-011, 8 N.M. 446, 46 P. 349.\n\nThe discretion of the trial judge in continuing a special term to conclude a pending case, even if prolonged beyond the day fixed for the regular term, was not controlled by former statute.Gonzales v. Cunningham, 164 U.S. 612, 17 S. Ct. 182, 41 L. Ed. 572 (1896).\n\nOrder held to adjourn court, not term.— An order of adjournment, \"It is ordered that the court do now adjourn until court in course,\" adjourns the court and not the term.Henry v. Lincoln Lucky & Lee Mining Co., 1906-NMSC-012, 13 N.M. 384, 85 P. 1043.\n\nEffect of elimination of term.— Fact that Laws 1905, ch. 89, § 1, eliminated a March term of court did not disqualify the jury commissioners who would have served that term from serving for the new April term.Territory v. Emilio, 1907-NMSC-020, 14 N.M. 147, 89 P. 239.\n\nProcuring the docketing of an appeal.— On appeal from justice of the peace (now magistrate) the clerk of the district court must docket the case on or prior to the second day of the next ensuing term, and the justice may do so (where the transcript is received and the docket fees are paid) before the first day of the term.Reece v. Montano, 1943-NMSC-054, 48 N.M. 1, 144 P.2d 461.\n\nFailure to move for disqualification at term may lose right.— Because the plaintiff failed to file an affidavit of disqualification after the first term had passed for hearing on motion by defendant for dismissing action on contention that over two years had transpired since anything had happened to bring the case to final judgment, defendant's right to do so had been lost.Heron v. Gaylor, 1948-NMSC-073, 53 N.M. 50, 201 P.2d 370;Heron v. Gaylor, 1948-NMSC-072, 53 N.M. 44, 201 P.2d 366 (decided under prior law) (see38-3-10 NMSA 1978).\n\nCommitment hearings held at commitment facility not precluded.— Absent a showing by a \"developmentally disabled\" person that his substantive rights would in any way be abridged if his involuntary commitment hearing is not held at the county seat, the district court is not precluded from adopting the practice of holding such hearings at the commitment facility when, in its discretion, such practice would better serve the public convenience. 1979 Op. Att'y Gen. No.79-20.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. —20 Am. Jur. 2d Courts § 21 et seq.\n\n21 C.J.S. Courts § 111 et seq.",

These expenses shall be paid from the funds of the district court of the judicial district for which the business is transacted.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 16-3-10, enacted by Laws 1968, ch. 69, § 24.\n\nCross references.— For principal office of judge being established at county seat by rule,see34-6-17 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor Per Diem and Mileage Act,see10-8-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nRepeals and reenactments.— Laws 1968, ch. 69, § 69, repealed former 16-3-10, 1953 Comp., relating to process and expenditures in the fifth judicial district.\n\nJudge's and reporter's expenses must be paid from court funds.— Payment of the expenses incurred by the district judge and court reporter from the funds of the district court is mandatory.Read v. Western Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 1977-NMCA-039, 90 N.M. 369, 563 P.2d 1162.\n\nPer diem and mileage may not be taxed as costs.— Costs are a creature of statute and may not be imposed in the absence of clear legislative authorization, and thus since no statute or rule of court imposes upon litigants in a civil case the burden of paying per diem and travel expenses incurred by a district judge and court reporter, such expenses could not be properly taxed as costs when plaintiff requested a continuance pending an appeal of one defendant's summary judgment.Read v. Western Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 1977-NMCA-039, 90 N.M. 369, 563 P.2d 1162.\n\nEmployees not entitled to additional compensation beyond expenses.— A district court reporter and a juvenile probation officer, full-time employees of the district court, are not entitled to additional compensation for services undertaken in magistrate court during regular working hours, aside from per diem and travel expenses authorized in this section. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-122.\n\nDemanding illegal fees.— An individual illegally receiving compensation both as a full-time district court reporter and as a deputy court clerk over the same period of time may be guilty of a petty misdemeanor under 30-23-1 NMSA 1978, and liable for restitution under 30-23-7 NMSA 1978. 1964 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 64-152.\n\nAbsence from principal office necessary for per diem or mileage.— This section establishes, as a condition precedent to the payment of either per diem or mileage to the district judge, that the district judge must be absent from the principal office. The principal office of the district judge is the county seat of one of the counties in that justice's judicial district. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-12.\n\nFor per diem, absence from duty post also necessary.— Per diem may be collected by an employee only when away from home and away from designated post of duty on official business. 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-27.\n\nSole judge must select his duty station.— Where the sole district judge in a multi-county judicial district resides in the county seat of one of the counties of the district and approximately 60 to 80% of the judge's time as a district judge must be spent at the county seat of the other county, with respect to per diem the judge must designate one city as duty station. If judge must choose a courthouse where a substantial portion of the duties are performed as the duty station, but a majority of that duty is not required at a courthouse before the judge may choose it to be the duty station. 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-27.\n\nNecessary travel away from home reimbursable.— If the judge selects a county seat other than county of residence as principal office, when the judge is traveling to and from the city which is away from home, if the travel is necessary to the discharge of official duties, then the judge should be paid the mileage rate provided in the Per Diem and Mileage Act. 1973 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 73-27.\n\nJudge entitled to mileage traveling between principal office and office at residence.— A district judge is entitled to mileage when traveling from the county seat to an additional office in the city of residence in order to conduct official business in the additional office and when the judge is present at the additional office on official business and then travels from the additional office to the county seat. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-12.\n\nPer diem.— A judge cannot be eligible for per diem for travel between the city of residence and the county seat which is the principal office, because such trips will not take the judge away from home and principal office at the same time. 1975 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 75-12.",

Att'y Gen. No. 55-6291.\n\nPost mortem expenses.— The expenses of post mortem examinations may be paid out of the court fund in cases where they are necessary to obtain evidence in homicide cases, if in the discretion of the court they should be so paid. 1937 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 37-1806.\n\nExpenses for transporting convicts.— Expenses of transportation of those sentenced to the reform school were chargeable to the court fund of the county committing such person. 1913 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13-1064.\n\nNor could criminal investigation expenses be paid from state court fund.— When it used the phrase \"trial of criminal cases,\" the legislature contemplated the submission of the issues to a court, the proceedings in court, the hearing of evidence and the final determination of the cause. This does not include the preparatory or investigative phases of a criminal trial, such as audits, depositions, laboratory tests and the like, but it does include such expenses as witness fees and jury fees. To hold otherwise would open the state court fund to use for investigative acts that might never be used in a criminal trial. While investigation and preparation are essential to any trial, the state court fund may not be disbursed to pay for them, but may only be disbursed for expenses directly attributable to the presentation of a criminal trial at a hearing in court. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 60-224 (rendered under prior law).\n\nJuvenile court duties statutorily uncompensated.— The court fund may not be spent for juvenile court duties conferred by statute when such duties are statutorily uncompensated. Faced with deciding whether the legislature intended not to compensate, or whether an unintentional commission was made, the failure to compensate was held purposeful. This does not apply to additional duties assumed by the court clerk at the court's request, for the proper administration of justice, when such duties are not statutorily conferred - and when such duties are performed, in the court's discretion, provision for payment out of the court fund may be made. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 57-181.",
