The chairmen of the house appropriations and finance and house taxation and revenue committees and the senate finance committee or members of their respective committees designated by each of them from time to time shall be members. The minority party shall be represented on the committee by at least one member from each house. Six of the remaining members shall be appointed from the house of representatives by the speaker, and the seven remaining members shall be appointed from the senate by the committees' committee or, if the appointments are made in the interim, by the president pro tempore after consultation with and agreement of a majority of the members of the committees' committee. An appointed member may designate a member of his party to serve in his place at a committee meeting at which the regular member is going to be absent if the member notifies the chairman of the legislative finance committee of his anticipated absence and his designee at least twenty-four hours before the committee meeting. The appointed members of the committee shall be appointed from each house so as to give the two political parties having the most members in each house the same total proportionate representation on the committee as prevails in that house; provided that in the computation, major fractions shall be counted as whole numbers. Minority members from the house shall be appointed by the speaker only from recommendations made by the minority floor leader, although the speaker shall retain the right to reject any such recommendations.\n\nB.

The committee shall elect from its membership such other officers as may be deemed necessary. The officers shall be appointed for terms coterminous with their membership on the committee. Each office shall be alternated between the respective houses each two years. For the terms beginning in 1979, the chairman shall be a senate member and the vice chairman, if any, shall be a house member. The appointing authority of each house shall exercise its appointing authority by naming the chairman or vice chairman, respectively, on this alternating basis.\n\nD.
