For provisions of former section, see the 2021 NMSA 1978 onNMOneSource.com.\n\nThe districts set out in the 2002 Senate Redistricting Act, Sections 2-8D-6 through 2-8D-49 NMSA 1978, were held to be malapportioned and therefore unconstitutional inEgolf v. Duran, D-101-CV-2011-02942 (1st Jud. Dist. January 25, 2012). The redistricting plan embodied in former 2-8E-1 NMSA 1978 was adopted by that court. The section number was assigned by the compiler.",
