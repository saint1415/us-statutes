During the life of the surviving spouse, the entire net income must be paid to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse in quarterly or more frequent installments; net income accrued or undistributed on the death of the surviving spouse must be paid to the estate of the spouse; if unproductive property is held in the trust, the surviving spouse at any time by written instrument delivered to the trustee may compel conversion of the unproductive property to productive property.\n\nC. During the life of the surviving spouse, the trustee at any time may pay to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse and issue of the testator amounts of the principal the trustee deems advisable, giving reasonable consideration to other resources available to the distributee, for the individual's needs for health, education, support or maintenance; for the purpose of making those discretionary payments, the principal must be administered as two separate shares, which at the inception of the trust must be equal; one share is the surviving spouse's share of the principal; during the life of the surviving spouse, payments may not be made from the surviving spouse's share to anyone other than the surviving spouse; primary consideration must be given to the needs of the surviving spouse and the children of the testator who are under the age of twenty-three years or under disability. The trustee may rely in good faith on a written statement furnished by a beneficiary. The discretion to pay principal to or for the benefit of any individual includes the discretion after that individual's death to pay expenses incurred before the individual's death and to pay funeral and burial expenses.
