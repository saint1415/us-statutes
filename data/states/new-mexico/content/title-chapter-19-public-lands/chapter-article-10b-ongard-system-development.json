      "text": "A. The legislature finds that a new oil and gas data base system will substantially increase revenues from state trust lands with resulting benefits to the trust beneficiaries and that funding the development of a new system with income from state trust lands constitutes a necessary and vital expense of the commissioner of public lands in the control and administration of the state trust lands and is a prudent and permitted use of trust income. The legislature further finds that a new oil and gas data base system will also increase severance tax revenues and that investment of the severance tax permanent fund in revenue bonds issued by the commissioner of public lands to finance the development of the new system is a prudent investment by the state.\n\nB. The purpose of the ONGARD Systems [System] Development Act [19-10B-1 to 19-10B-8 NMSA 1978] is to provide for the development of an oil and gas data base system that will assure that the state is receiving the oil and gas tax and royalty revenue to which it is entitled, that the appropriate calculations are based on proper volumes and values and that correct amounts are remitted and accurately accounted for.\n\nHistory:Laws 1990, ch. 127, § 2.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.",

Any balance remaining in the fund after the ONGARD system has been fully implemented shall be used to retire the bonds or, if the bonds have been fully retired, shall be deposited into the state lands maintenance fund.\n\nE. The bonds may be sold only at a private sale and only to the state investment officer or to the state treasurer.\n\nF. This section is full authority for the issuance and sale of the bonds, and the bonds shall not be invalid for any irregularity or defect in the proceedings for their issuance and sale and shall be incontestable in the hands of bona fide purchasers or holders of the bonds for value.\n\nG. An amount of money in the state lands maintenance fund sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds as they become due in each year shall be set aside, and is hereby pledged, for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds.\n\nH. The bonds shall be payable by the state treasurer who shall keep a complete record relating to the payment of the bonds.\n\nHistory:Laws 1990, ch. 127, § 5.",
