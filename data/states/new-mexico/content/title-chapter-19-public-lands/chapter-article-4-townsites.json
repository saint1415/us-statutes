Board of Trustees, 1957-NMSC-022, 62 N.M. 319, 309 P.2d 989.\n\nRemedy not foreclosed.— Action of Catholic bishop on behalf of church, occupant of land granted to probate judge in 1925 to be held in trust for the occupant, in seeking to have the land conveyed to him by townsite's board of trustees, operated neither as an election of remedies nor an estoppel in pais, nor did his act in defending the action brought to have the deed set aside have such an effect; the only remedy available to him was that provided in this section, which he pursued in his first affirmative judicial act of seeking a conveyance from the probate judge.Alvarez v. Board of Trustees, 1957-NMSC-022, 62 N.M. 319, 309 P.2d 989.\n\nRepeal of conflicting provisions.— Two provisions of Section 19-4-10 NMSA 1978 are repugnant to and irreconcilable with this section and were therefore repealed thereby, namely, the absolute bar in Section 19-4-10 NMSA 1978 to an occupant who failed to file a claim within the specified time limit and the provision of Section 19-4-10 NMSA 1978 that upon failure to file a claim the property reverted to the town, since if failure to file resulted in property reverting to the town, title would no longer be in the probate judge and this section could never be utilized.Alvarez v.
